031606792X|5.0|Really good wrap up for the Twilight series, with enough suspense to keep it fun.  Can't wait for the movie!!
B00008RH3L|3.0|I found this film relies on its music and cinematography more than its story.  It didn't move me as it did others.  I find it boring and meandering.  There are great actors and great scenery.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.
015206396X|5.0|\\"Graceling\\" is such a magical book. I couldn't stop laughing, or sighing (oh, Po) and rooting for Katsa and Po. The writing didn't miss a thing. Every little detail folded nicely into the story plot, every detail was there for a reason. I especially admire Cashore for writing simple scenes --like the horseback rides, camp fires, and practice fights-- with such ease, yet capturing our hearts still. I couldn't help but love every moment of the book. Not a single part was boring or slow. I wanted to keep going, seeing their travels after the book ended.<br /><br />The relationship between the characters is what really hooked me. For one, I loved Katsa and her group. Giddon was an especially fun character. Waiting to see how Katsa would handle her new found information was quite entertaining. Raffin just warmed my heart; he was the caring best friend, who was the shoulder to lean on or the wise advice Katsa needed. Po..... I couldn't get enough of him. He's such an intriguing character, full of life and wonder. His and Katsa's relationship was in now way traditional but it worked out prefectly. They fit so well, it was just beautiful and I enjoyed seeing Katsa grow and mature, abandoning her tough skin for a more loving and caring one. Katsa is the prefect heroine--tough, rugged, free spirited, and most of all courageous and strong-- yet, when it came to things that mattered she did the right thing, never faltering from what her heart desired.<br /><br />I tried looking for quotes, but I ended up almost rereading the whole book. Every quote is a good quote. That or it would have spoiled the plot. So I picked two.<br /><br />* \\"Who were they, to take her fight away from her and turn it into some sort of understanding between themselves? He should've taken more care of her face? She would knock his nose from his face. She would thump the both, and apologize to neither.\\" Love Katsa's mean and tough attitude, not letting two guys gawk over her like she's ::gasp:: a girl?!<br /><br />*\\"..and wondered if other girls in sunder, and across the seven kingdoms, carried knives; or if they all looked to their fathers or brothers for every protection.\\" See, Katsa's caring and warm hearted concern for girls and their need to protect themselves and not rely on outside help from males. Trust yourself and protect yourself. There isn't always going to be a man there to help.her girls in sunder, and across the seven kingdoms, carried knives; or if they all looked to their fathers or brothers for every protection.\\" See, Katsa's caring and warm hearted concern for girls and their need to protect themselves and not rely on outside help from males.

B001IB63KQ|2.0|I love Paramore, I really do. I just hate the fans. The majority of fans are teenage girls. Lead singer Haley Williams is talented but when she pauses mid-song, to let the crowd scream the words to my favorite songs, it really grinds my gears. For that reason I rate this recording poorly.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Season 1 and 2 was great, and I had no doubt in my mind that Season 3 would be also.  The only thing that seemed a little different from the first 2 was that Dexter seemed a little darker.  Season 3, still being awesome, seemed to be more of a soap opera rather than the dark humor from Seasons 1 & 2.  I am ready for Season 4 and 5 now.
B0000A5A0T|3.0|Unquestionably one of the all-time best ever jazz recordings, and probably my favorite Coltrane album.  Plenty has already been written here about the music ... this is jazz at it's best!  If you just want some great tunes, and don't really care so much about some differences in recording quality, then don't hesitate to get this album today - you won't be disappointed!    The rest of this review is for those folks like me, who do notice subtle differences, and want the best possible sound quality:    Sadly, I have to proclaim my disappointment with this \\"remastered\\" release.  I also own the 1997 CD release, which sounds significantly better.  This new release is over-compressed, and has had a low-quality digital EQ boost in the treble, replacing the nuance and texture of Jones' excellent drumming with a homogenous sizzle - the cymbals have lost all semblance of realism.  Blue Note should be ashamed for their mishandling of this historic recording, and especially for caving in to the over-compression fad which plagues the industry.  I expect this sort of mindless mastering in bad pop recordings, not the greatest jazz of all time!    To some, this may come off as nitpicking, but I hope you'll excuse my negativity - to me it is disheartening to hear this sort of careless treatment of such treasured music, at the hands of professionals who surely know better.    Coltrane's beautiful music deserves a lot more care than this.    If you would like to own a better copy of this album, do yourself a favor and skip this edition - get the 1997 (20-bit \\"Super Bit-Map\\") CD instead.  Your ears will thank you.
B0006Z2KYI|4.0|A decent little film shot in 1942. Could we say it was shot dead? Or is that too Jewish a piece of humor? The plot is absurd and that is why it is funny, but not a deep intellectual funny, nor a deep artistic and esthetic  funny, nor even a deep emotional funny. Just funny for war time, funny for when everyone is crying, weeping or plain dying. We think of the other Jewish actor who did a similar impersonation of Hitler, Charlie Chaplin. But Charlie Chaplin played the real Hitler, whereas here it is always a false Hitler, tricking the real one in his back. That is funny for sure but that is also kind of vain, except if you take it is as a plain entertainment for an audience that wants to laugh at their arch enemy. So they play the Mickey out of him. But what's left after sixty or more years? Not much except the scene about \\"to be or not to be\\", played three times on a stage in the context of Hamlet in the film. The force of this sequence is in the fact that an actor plays Hamlet in front of an audience and a member of that audience stands up and walks out on him when he says that sentence, and the scene is of course in front of another audience, us. The second level of that distantiation is what makes it funny because we can see the varying surprise and anger of the actor who takes it as an insult before he learns it was coded language. And it is true Ehrard has it right when he says that what this Tura actor did to Shakespeare, they, the Nazis, are doing it to Poland. But then the third time, and that is only true for us, though also for one person in the audience in the theater in the film, it becomes absurd because there is no explanation for that total stranger to stand up and walk out.  But apart from that the film has aged tremendously and even the acting has aged and seems so unnatural, though we can accept that from most of the main actors who are supposed to be actors and hence to play a role, even in real life. The only important thing is that in 1942 the film is heavily speaking of concentration camps. If Lubitsch knew about it, why didn't the allies know about it and why didn't they do something to stop the massacre? At least they had no excuse and they cannot pretend they were less informed than Lubitsch. That's the only interesting point of that film still today.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDfilm is heavily speaking of concentration camps.

B000DWMN2S|4.0|Movie fine and funny - that is why the rating.  But nobody in primary reviews says - nor does Amazon - if there are any extras - particularly interested in deleted scenes since they are mentioned in IMDB.  Only want DVD's including such, so would like to know.
1400096936|5.0|Far and away Winslow's most epic work, The Power of the Dog is a fascinating tale that follows drug kingpins, a high-end prostitute, a law-enforcement agent, and the ways their jobs and lives intersect.  Winslow's book are smoothly written, his characters are complex yet are still able to connect to with reader, and the way he pulls everything together in the end is nothing short of great.  Would highly recommend this book and all of Winslow's other works.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|As someone who HATES horror movies I was very happy to find this as being much more of a psychological, though still gory, movie.  I watched this when it first came out (being dragged there by a boyfriend of course) and was very surprised by how much I enjoyed this~ The biggest reason I am such a fan of this film is because for pretty much every movie or TV show I have ever seen I am able to see/guess what is happening next, but the ending to this movie was a huge surprise to me, and that alone, in my opinion, makes this a movie worth seeing.     Definitively not your normal horror type movie.... more low key though many times at the edge of your seat, and being more psychological it really gets you thinking and guessing.  After all, the main point of this \\"Killer\\" is to not kill them directly but make them kill each other/themselves, and in many ways the Killer is the true, though twisted, definition of a Vigilante since the only victims are people that were deemed unmoral, etc.    I think that people who like shows such as CSI will enjoy this movie very much, and the gore level isn't too much higher (for the most part) then the gore in those types of shows.  If you are uncomfortable about even that level of gore, or overall dislike psychological thrillers, then this movie is not for you.      I do highly recommend this movie, but all of the sequels (at least the first 2, I stopped after that... though I did see some of the 3rd) are god-awful... going back to more of the regular \\"horror movie\\" type of lame and cheap scare/lots of gore.... a HUGE disappointment after seeing the first.    (as a completely random side note, I have always loved Cary Elwes, especially in \\"The Princess Bride\\" so it was interesting seeing him doing a movie like this... though it was sad seeing him as a chubby middle-aged guy... but... it happens I guess, lol)

B001FBSMF8|5.0|This is in NO WAY a Soundgarden or Audioslave album. This is Chris's voice over Timbaland's music. It is a great album but if you have your heart set on another Superunknown then you will end up seriously hating this album with out giving it a chance. It happened to me with Slipknot's Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses, dispite the fact it was a great CD it wasn't the slipknot i was use to and took me a year to get over the fact they changed as a band. This CD is focused more on a pop/RnB fan base, even though i'm not into either types of music \\"Metal and underground hip-hop fan\\" I still like this CD. If you're not sure your mind is open enough then just imagine this is a new artist and not chris. Just give it a couple of trys. Don't give up on it too early. No telling what his next CD will be like.
1603580557|5.0|Systems are complex; they need not be complicated. Donella H. Meadows in her book \\"Thinking in Systems\\" does an excellent job in untangling the complex elements of systems so as to make an understanding of systems less complicated. With diagrams and clear explanations, Meadows provides the reader with the basic knowledge needed to comprehend the complex world of systems. But she does not end there. She also explains how systems may be influenced. The book identifies system traps and how to avoid them. Leverage points for intervening in systems are explained. How to live within systems is discussed.<br /><br />This is a timely book. The economic, social, political, and environmental crises we face today are systems problems. They can be resolved only if we understand the dynamics of systems. A quote in the book by V&aacute;clav Havel reads that \\"we must learn to wait as we learn to create.\\" An understanding of systems can give us the patience and knowledge we need as citizens and leaders to resolve our current crises. Reading this book is an excellent start toward achieving that understanding.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|What an absolutely beautiful coming of age tale.<br /><br />Let the Right One In offers a splendid contrast of tender emotion and eye-popping violence to the vampire genre.  Fearlessly it tiptoes a provocative line of adolescence and terror while channeling heavy doses of emerging sexuality.  Powerful stuff, this creepy story is bound to suck the marrow from your bones and leave you floating helplessly toward your most devilish nightmare.<br /><br />It's the story of boy meets girl, a girl who harnesses a deep dark secret.  They form a unique bond as they walk a tumultuous journey of acceptance and self-discovery.<br /><br />This movie features an excellent build-up of controlled suspense and visceral fear.  The acting by the young stars is phenomenal, plus the music and special effects are top notch.  I think the most impressive part is the camera work, the visual style is just perfect with the off-center closeups, interesting angles, and some unique shots filmed from a distance.  It really gives a feeling of helplessness at crucial times.<br /><br />There is one particular scene I really hated though.  There's a vicious attack by a group of crazy kitties?!?  These wild furballs start chomping down on a woman who had just recently been bitten by the vampire.  Huh?!?  To me, this incident seemed misplaced, silly, and downright comical.<br /><br />That's the only real misstep in this otherwise immaculate Swedish horror film.  It has plenty of dynamic moments that will leave quite an impression.  Very artistic and unsettling, 4.5 stars.
0374264260|5.0|Mr. Quick has written a book that has dark surface with bright undertones of hope and relationships.     The best way to describe the book is that it deals with complex issues in a very accessible and simple way. It will not surprise me to see a movie based on the book.    Kudos to Mr. Quick for hitting a home run his first time out on the plate. I look forward to reading more from him.

1401309666|3.0|Chris Anderson does a great job explaining the phenomenon that is happening in this new age of virtually unlimited choices in just about every category where \\"shelf space\\" or Internet listings cost next to nothing, inventory does not have to be physically maintained and a physical store is not required.  Indeed, there is money to be made from products that are not \\"hits\\".  With so many choices and people searching for an ever-so-specific range of products, companies who offer a very wide range of products will be able to sell a few of each unit per year.  On aggregate, these few sales across such a wide range of niches can add up to serious money if your carrying costs are almost zero.<br /><br />But how do these companies attract their audience?<br /><br />You'll have to read some other book to learn the answer to that question because Anderson does not answer it.<br /><br />This book stops short of telling us how these aggregators of vast amounts of products that appeal to a wide range of niche interests build their brands so people find and prefer them in the first place.  If anyone can now easily list a virtually unlimited number of products online in just about any product category, what is going to set any one apart from the rest in any given category?<br /><br />That's where this book falls down.<br /><br />This book should have talked about the importance of building a dominant brand in your category and how to create strategic brand awareness so YOU are the first choice for consumers shopping your category.  In fact, with the cost of entry so low, the author does not tell us how to compete against other companies who choose to operate in the long tail of the same category.  If long tail theory holds, then there will eventually be an unlimited number of competitors offering the same vast array of products in your category.  How can any one stand out and be preferred?<br /><br />The answer is to build your brand and the author does not delve into the topic which is a shame.<br /><br />This is a very good book but it is not going to tell you how to be the supplier of choice in your part of the long tail.

B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele won the Grammy as Best New Artist and the album doesn't disappoint. She has a fresh voice and wrote or co-wrote most of the songs on the album. She isn't particularly physically attractive but her vocal talent is clear. She has quite a range of styles and matches her voice well with a range of instrumentation. It will be interesting to see what trajectory her career takes whenever her sophomore release comes out.
0470449748|5.0|After going through all the GMAT books, here is my comparison about some of the most popular GMAT books:    Official Guides:  Pros - Excellent source of GMAT questions. Very well organized with real test like questions.  Cons - No review of any math content or test-taking strategies. Not very good explanations of practice questions.  Overall, the Official Guide is a must have for all test-takers. It will give you a good idea about the type of questions to expect on the GMAT; however, if you need more than just a bank of questions, you need to look at some other source.    Kaplan:  Pros - It covers every section of the test as much as possible by a single book. Also a good source for additional practice questions.  Cons - Review of math content is not thorough but just the very basics. Not enough explanation of test taking strategies. Full of guessing techniques with no real mathematical solutions. Not good enough explanations of practice questions. Unrealistic questions.    Princeton:  Pros - Good for learning how to make educated guess and process of elimination. Focuses more on test taking techniques.  Cons - Review of math content is not thorough but just the very basics. Not enough explanation of test taking strategies. Full of guessing techniques with no real mathematical solutions. Not good enough explanations of practice questions. Weird sense of humor of Joe Blogs.    Dummies:  Pros - Good book if you are looking for test taking strategies and brief overview as it covers every section. It's definitely worth the price.  Cons - Not a regular standalone type of a book. You'll certainly need additional help.    Barrons:  Pros - Intensive math review. Big list of questions. Good test taking strategies. Very well organized. This is by far the best of the all-in-one kinds of books.  Cons - Although the book has a good math review, it doesn't go deep enough into each concept. Does not have a good section for logical reasoning (permutation, combination, probability,etc) questions, which is one of the most important question-type. Does not break down the concepts/questions step by step. This is the only book I recommend you must buy apart from the OG.    EZ Solutions (series of books):  Pros - Thorough math review from A to Z in the review books. Effective test taking strategies. Abundant solved examples. Numerous practice exercises. Great practice question bank in basic and advanced workbooks. As with most books, you are expected to already have a good knowledge about the various match concepts, but with these books, you can literally start from scratch and reach the most advanced level of the GMAT.  Cons - To get the best result from these books, you have to invest in buying several books (set of 10 books), but if you compare the cost and benefits, the benefits outweigh the cost, or you can buy a few not all. Missing the verbal section. This is not a good option if you are looking for a very basic brush-up. Recommended for serious test takers who have enough time for preparation.    I hope my review will help some of you in making the right decision.

B001QB9H1K|2.0|Transporter is such an amazing film, a real surprise, great timing, interesting story, and just the right amount of action. Fast forward to version 3, and everything just feels wrong.<br /><br />The opening 10 or 15 minutes pack some interesting story line, decent action, that car crashing through Frank's living room wall was incredible. From there the film just goes down hill. The real turning point, Frank starts talking to Valentina (breaks his rule about the cargo), and she refuses to speak (invoking his rule about not talking). Finally she talks about food at a restaurant. It's foreshadowing, but she does talk about carrots a lot. And sadly the only thought this reviewer and his two sons had was, well does that help her keep her red hair and freckles? Sad but true, the movie just completely lost it's way at this point.<br /><br />The action scenes are exciting and pitiful at the same time. The excitment is in the chase and the rapid fire editing, slick cars, beautiful scenery, and pulsating music and sound. The awful part, and this absolutely kills these sequences, so much sped up motion was used as to make these scenes almost stupid. Sped up and slo-mo fighting scenes were tiresome. The worst was the driving on two wheels between the two semi's stunt - plain old, flat out, stupid, defying all laws of physics and the darn CG effect was too obvious.<br /><br />It's a sad movie when the viewer can actually see the light green tint around the edge of the actors in front of a green screen (just about every in car conversation is plagued with this). If the action had been furious enough, the dialog compelling, the story interesting; the green screen effect would have faded away. Instead it's out there in the open, made even visible on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />There's a ton of continuity issues, where things don't match from one scene to the next. Frankly, this reviewer has never seen a longer list for any other movie that that internet movie database. T 3 has probably set a record for the most (there are over 30 goofs).<br /><br />Natalya Rudakova is just not a very good actress, her delivery of lines is flat and almost read from the script. She is not really that beautiful, certainly not somebody that Frank should be attracted to. The reviewer found himself noticing the dark marks on her lips, either cold sores or freckles. It's very sad when a lead actress just isn't captivating. Jason Statham is the only reason this film gets two stars. This is essentially a guy movie, not really a date film. Jason taking his shirt off several times, well just wasn't a smart move; it plays to the wrong audience. The fishing scene with the French police inspector is charming. Him driving an old Renault 6 is also an interesting contrast. The other characters are just flat.<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13. There is no nudity. The f bomb is in a subtitle once. There's plenty of violence, a fair amount of blood, and several times where a person is shown being shot. Given that the movie is so bad, it's probably smart to respect the age guideline.<br /><br />Blu-Ray was a mixed blessing for this film. The sound is incredible. It will excercise your subwoofer. The gun shots and fighting sounds are significantly higher volume than the dialog. The high resolution of Blu-Ray shows all the bad / cheap CG effects the director chose. On DVD, these might not have been as visible.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray disc includes some really lame Mogolo (apologies for not spelling this correctly) piece of junkware software. It took a good solid 15 minutes (at 12Mbps very fast internet connection) to download the program. It appears to allow a person to view a clip of the film, store it, add some graphics, and then share it with others. After step 12 in the demo, I gave up totally. Cr__ware experiments just keep happening with Blu-Ray.

B001R0KH3M|5.0|I loved Stevie Wonder in the '70s and was fortunate to see him in concert in '74 as a teenager. I bought the live DVD the day it was released because it was a first for Stevie, but didn't have high expectations since his work the past 25 years hasn't match his '70s peak. So it was a great thrill to thoroughly enjoy the concert. I was singing, dancing and crying alone in my living room. It was an obvious labor of love for all involved and I thank Stevie's Mom for telling him in a dream to get back out there and entertain the people like only he can. I regret that I missed last year's tour. Hopefully I'll get another chance to see him live soon!
B000VNMMQG|4.0|Naturally the film romanticises the original story of this great unselfish man, William Wilberforce, who fought so hard and tirelessly for the abolition of the slave trade. But what a wonderfully fitting accolade for such a great man. It's the feeling, the spirit of the man that really was captured in this piece. I have been to Wilberforce's home, now a museum, many times and felt the same spirit- brave and determined- there, as I felt when watching the film.<br />Go Wilber!
B000000OU0|5.0|\\"Hell Freezes Over\\" is one dynamite CD of a dynamite concert.  My only regret is that I couldn't have been there live.    The introduction to \\"Hotel California\\" is in my humble opinion a truly classic track.  \\"Desparado\\" as a grand finale is priceless.    I don't know why this wasn't available on Itunes, but when I couldn't find my original CD for a new friend I had to order a duplicate so she could hear it.  We weren't disappointed, and we weren't sorry.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|This album is a terrific mix of rock and roll and ballads. I think David Cook was one of the better winners of American Idol in recent couple of years (they really blew it not voting on Daughtry!) and if he is handled properly and he makes some good choices himself, he has a bright future.<br />His voice on ballads is amazing - would have loved to had him record Lionel Richie's \\"Hello\\" which he performed during the show - these are really one of his strong areas; but what isn't?  Love the artist, love the album.
B0000DJZ8R|2.0|I just watched Grapes Of Wrath last night,and I think it is highly overrated!<br /><br />Watching the Joad family suffer through one miserable experience after another and especially to end with such a tone of hopelessness was not a good film experience.<br /><br />I just see no redeeming quality in this film.If our country was so hopeless as portrayed in this film,then I would not have enjoyed the childhood that I did,being born in 1950!<br /><br />I gave it two stars only for the stark portrayal of the inhumanity of corporate farms/corporate greed,and how migrant workers are treated to this day!<br /><br />A film full of misery and injustice,for lovers of 'downers' only.

B001DJ7PR8|2.0|Sometimes filming a movie in an exotic locale with artists, poets, love triangles and red cars end up being just a smutty collection of artists and poets in an exotic locale that drive red cars. This film was very unsatisfying for me. First of, after having visited Barcelona a number of times many years ago, I was looking forward to a good movie about the city, but the Barcelona scenes seemed to be edited to show as little of the city as possible. Second, as a big fan of Penelope Cruz's movies, I expected great things only to find out that she is totally unconvincing in this movie. The scenes of her as a painter and taking pictures are painful to watch. I would say there are really only a couple of bright spots in the movie. Javier Bardem does a good and convincing job of acting, and Scarlett Johansson's character seems fairly believable. In any case, this is one of those movies for which the intention seems to be to make an artistic movie with meaning, but for me it comes off as being a collection of art-movie motifs with no apparent meaning and a couple of Woody Allen's New York characters thrown in.

While not my preferred genre, I really like this album.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I watched this movie in the theater and thought it was awesome both in storyline and for graphics (in 3D), and when I bought it, I already knew I wouldn't be getting the \\"Real-D\\" graphics because the technology used in movie theaters isn't compatible with home systems (at least most - unless you have some massively expensive technology set-up)... but basically, it's the typical red/green 3-D graphics and they deliver well.  People who have complained about the color being washed out probably didn't pay attention to the box that popped up before starting the 3-D movie that said to turn your TV settings from \\"Cinema\\" to \\"Standard\\" because the movie settings are set to Standard, and Cinema will only wash out the color.  As for the \\"too much green\\" or \\"too much red\\" comments, well, that just comes with the technology.  If you want to at least watch it in 3-D, then this is definitely a good buy - and you're not really losing out much if you don't like the 3-D version because it still comes with a 2-D version, as well.
B00003CXDV|5.0|SciFi fans have been picked on for years. It's an age old joke, the nerd in his or her basement with a 'set' of their favorite TV show or movie, dressed in a homemade costume, recreating or living their own fantasy in the fantasy world. Well, Galaxy Quest takes it a good bit further.<br /><br />Galaxy Quest starts where all good SciFi fans would be most suited: a SciFi convention, dedicated to a TV show cancelled years ago, but living on through its fans. Here, the actors, played by Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman, Tony Shalhoub and Daryl Mitchell, settled into their old roles for the fans. Seemingly unable to gain any other line of work, Conventions and store openings are their only way to get by.<br /><br />After a rude awakening by some hecklers, Tim Allen explodes over a group of young fans questions and heads home to drink it off. The next morning starts the real adventure: aliens come calling for help. Allen as Jason Nesmith as Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggert is transported to the real NSEA Protector, as envisioned by the Thermians, lead by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni. A hung over Nesmith takes everything to be exquisite set pieces and negotiates with the enemy.<br /><br />From here, the movie picks up as Nesmith returns to Earth to seek out his fellow actors, including the show's own Red Shirt who hitches along, to show them the real thing. Watching this movie can be like looking into a mirror for us geeks. You can either laugh because you've either seen or done or you can cringe because you've either seen it or done it.<br /><br />True to form, the movie runs almost entirely like you'd expect an episode to run. Ship fights (with the actors being thrown about the bridge), away missions, transporter accidents (\\"And exploded.\\"), and alien doppelgangers. But the kicker is watching the character realize what they need to do. And then do it hilariously.<br /><br />I can't count how many times I've watched this movie, but I always end up laughing throughout it. It's just funny watching even with a weird sense of social commentary. Unleash your nerd and give it a chance.a weird sense of social commentary. Unleash your nerd and give it a chance.
B0009WFFS6|1.0|I didn't have much hope for this from the start, yet probably like so many other fans I was wishing for some kind of resemblance to the groundbreaking band and sound I've enjoyed. There's truly nothing here folks. Ginger is flat alright, but I feel it's got to be said that Eric is really the no-show.  With all due respect to him and his achievements, he seems to have made no effort to recapture any of the magic. Completely gone is the fire, ferocity, imagination, style, improvisation, spaciness, intensity, and so on that marked his playing back then.  Not to mention the more tangible technical effects like any feedback, vibrato, etc, - all screaming for a Gibson SG like that lovely \\"Fool\\" he once played.  Now I wasn't expecting the brilliance of shows like the Whisky A Go-Go club or Detroit Grand Ballroom, as heard on the boots available from their fall '67 tour, but those players were absent completely. Gone was what made his playing so incredible then - the fusion of blending the Mayall period licks with the psychedelia, and even a little country for good measure.  It could well be true what Eric has said in interviews - that there was a brief peak, and '68 was a long fall. By the time of the pro live recordings of early '68, you can tell the enthusiasm is fading. He may have indeed blacked out much of the time, which is unfortunate. Eric has never seemed to be one to look back. Ironically it's Jack, who is showing his age the most, that comes through with some degree of style and imagination.  To me, this reunion certainly did not merit filling London or New York's most prestigious halls or arenas. Or making this DVD.  RIP Cream.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|This album sounds a lot like of Daft Punk.  It's quite a perfect mix of homework, discovery and human after all.  Actually this is much better than the recent work of daft punk.  Almost every track is a hit.  It's not easy listening - it will take you 2-3 listening through to start getting addicted.  A bit on the \\"dark\\" side, not typical souless dance music.  After that you will love it.  A MUST BUY for every electronic music amateur!!!
1416595546|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this novel got better as it moved along. The last section was riveting and I finished it very quickly unable to do anything else until I did. Others have gone over the story so I won't go on. I wasn't disappointed in the first section as some have been, but just thought it got better and better.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show has got to be one of the most original comedies in a long time.  It's nice to have a break from sitcoms with conventional characters.  Plenty of shows have had the typical \\"geek\\" such as Urkel or Screech, but it's nice to see a show that dared make eccentric geniuses stars of the show.   It never fails to make me laugh so hard to the point of tears.  I hope Big Bang Theory lasts many many seasons.
1423101464|5.0|this book is great.Perfect! The best in the series so far.The greek myth in the story appeared to me instantly. It is from \\"the boy who flew\\" which i read in my reading text book.So it does have a greek myth.Duh!
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I haven't had any difficultly with this product, except it's no good with dog hair. The hair gets wrapped around the brushes constantly and is very difficult and time consuming to remove from the brushes. It's fine for crumbs and other small bits, but not hair.<br /><br />The location of the battery makes it hard to get under beds, etc. But they have a new version that folds the bar down, so that should help.
B000002GQH|4.0|This remaster pales by comparision to the new ones issued in 2008 as produced by Justin Hayard.  The new remasters are phenomenal, incredible....if the one you are viewing here says issued in 1993...don't bother, it's okay but the new one is light years ahead.  The new one also has many bonus tracks etc and is in a word, simply great!
B001I4TR74|5.0|This is probably one of the best relationship book out there. I was nodding my head from the beginning of the book to the end of the book. I realized that I was making all those classic female \\"mistakes\\" in my own past relationship and it made sense to me why the relationship didn't quite work out. It's very practical and it's also very fun to read as it is humorous. I highly recommend this to book!
B0018BB20W|5.0|Incredible, phenomenal, fantastic, wonderful!  I always liked these old Moody Blues albums but the sound was never very good.  Well, listen to them again for the first time!  The remastering on these is way beyond good, it's tremendous....I can't believe how much better this sounds.  There were some \\"Remasters\\" in the early nineties that were mildly better.  These are exponentially better.....don't hesitate, if you are a fan...buy these remastered Moody Blues CD's.  I bought them all and like \\"In Search of the lost Chord,\\" \\"Threshold\\" and \\"Every Good Boy\\" the best, but they are all good. Extra tracks are fun too
B000W4KSVA|5.0|\\"I think the main thing a musician would like to do is to give a picture to the listeners of the many wonderful things he knows of and senses in the universe.\\" ~ John Coltrane (1926-1967) ~<br /><br />Gene Lees wrote on Liner Notes that John Coltrane had on occasion expressed puzzlement over such descriptions of himself as \\"best of the angry tenors.\\" He once said: \\"I guess they say that because I play the horn hard.\\" And if I may add, he played with love and dedication that shows in every note, his interpretations radiate simple elegance and respect to the material.<br /><br />\\"Ballads\\" is a collection of eight striking tunes recorded in 1961 and 1962 by John Coltrane Quartet featuring himself on tenor sax, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass and Elvin Jones on drums, with the special participation of a guest musician, bassist Reggie Workman on \\"It's Easy To Remember,\\" one of my absolute favorite tunes from one of my favorite composers of all-time, Richard Rodgers.<br /><br />The quartet's musicianship is unrivaled. They play with utmost confidence making sure that all the tunes are precisely executed starting off with my top choice from this set, a Jimmy McHugh classic standard with a beautiful melody that is deeply felt, \\"Say It (Over and Over Again)\\" down to the perfect ender, \\"Nancy (With The Laughing Face).\\" Every tune is an exquisite musical moment where Trane shows off his virtuosity, subtlety and finesse in his playing.<br /><br />This collection represents some of the sweetest sounds in jazz that music lovers will find irresistibly charming ... tunes that are soothing and easy on the ears. Don't miss out on this CD. It's one of \\"the angry tenor's\\" best recordings. It is so beautiful that you can even classify it as a Desert Island CD without having second thoughts.<br /><br />With my heartfelt recommendation for your listening pleasure now and forever.<br /><br />P.S.

B0007PAMBK|4.0|I'm specifically reviewing the Legend Films version of this DVD, with MST3K's Mike Nelson providing commentary. The first thing to be considered is the fact that this is a \\"colorized\\" version, and you will find that the \\"colorization\\" process has come a long way. In the early days, colorized films looked like black and white films with four pastel tints: blue, green, pink, and bronze. Nothing looked \\"natural.\\" In this film, you will see a moment here and there in which a character has the old-style bronze skin tone, but those moments are too few to mention. \\"Carnival of Souls\\" was the forerunner of later...and better...films that followed, so the debate over whether this film should have been colorized at all is a matter of preference. The print is clean, it looks good, and that's what really matters.    This film was a wise choice for Mike Nelson's wise-cracking commentary (as well as the follow-up \\"RiffTrax\\" version with Kevin \\"Tom Servo\\" Murphy and Bill \\"Crow Mach II\\" Corbett). There are some killer scenes in the movie, blueprints that filmmakers still follow to this day...and long, long stretches of tedium. That's where Mike (on the DVD) and the \\"Three Riffers\\" (on commentary available from the RiffTrax Web Site) really shine.    Leading lady Candace Hilligloss made one other feature film...\\"The Curse of the Living Corpse,\\" with a pre-\\"Jaws\\" Roy Scheider...available on the [[ASIN:B000C65YHG The Del Tenney Double Feature]] DVD.    Here, she's more than up to the task of portraying the heroine with a constant sense of foreboding. It's difficult to discuss the film without using spoilers (although it is so well known among fans of the genre). Many directorial aspects are reminiscent of schlock-gore pioneer Herschel Gordon Lewis (minus the gore).     At the time of this review (2009), the film is 47 years old. Many superior films have followed in its wake. If you're a fan of the classics like [[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)]], you mayvery well love it. If you define \\"horror movies\\" by modern-day works like Rob Zombie's [[ASIN:B000AXWHSA The Devil's Rejects (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]], you might find yourself bored to tears.    Read the reviews, read what others have to say on the Web...this film is considered a classic for a reason.
B00005JPY2|5.0|Amazing adaptation to the book. I've seen it a couple times (so far) and each time, I pick up more of the nuances, as it meets all of the expectations of an epic story, while staying true to the craft - that is a comic fervor, a melodramatic message, with the usual (and unexpected) turns that make you want to sit back, and bask in the intellectual covenent involving a message far reaching, beyond the basics, which will make you peel the layers after each viewing. A total pleasure for all of the senses. Yes, I know there is always the nitpicking by those who truly do not understand the genius of the interpretation, and all I can say is, take in the whole process, rather than question the parts, and you will walk away satisfied.
1594201927|5.0|What a great explanation of how we got into our current recession (or near depression if not depression, nobody knows). But personal experience tells me that the author's comparison of real estate and the S&P 500 is not as complete as it could be. Unlike the S&P 500 real estate markets are local and in many real estate markets rents are much higher relative to price than dividends for stocks. Stripping out both distorts many local realities. Also Niall Ferguson seems to overlook the benefits of leverage (at the right price, rental income and terms and conditions) that is not available to investor's in the S&P 500. In Seattle at this point in time (starting in 1975) real estate purchased at the right price relative to rents (I calculate that in my book: How to Invest in Condominiums) is beating the pants of the S&P 500. The benchmark US stock market index (S&P 500) applies to everyone the Case-Shiller national home price index does not.

B001DPC52C|5.0|Trust me, my tastes are weird when it comes to music. I love classical music, hard rock, prog. metal, THRASH (the most prob), Power Metal, etc., and I've been playing music for over 20 yrs. I still get amazed at, though, at some of the fantastic musicianship that's out there. Just when I think Metal is gasping it's final breath...  Anyway, this CD, along with the bonus DVD of their live performance, is def. worth the few bucks. If you like Melodic Metal or Symphonic Metal, Progressive, etc. you are gonna love this one. It really falls in line with what Nightwish, and to some extent, Lacuna Coil are doing. If you like Nightwish and Lacuna - buy it now. You won't be disappointed. The songwriting is there, the musicianship, and the production is excellent. I'd love to know how much they spent to put on a concert like that.

B0015DWLD0|5.0|I loved this book. From the third page - it took three pages to get into it - to the final page I was hooked. Smart, funny, gripping and completely original. Wonderful.    It is also incredibly informative. As the United States sees more and more jobs sent to India, it is important to see that there is another side to that story. Life in India is not as cheery, democratic or neo-American as some in the U.S. may assume.    Don't be too envious toward India; at least, not yet.
B00005NKCM|5.0|As I watched this show, I thought this show could have been produced in the 90's or 00's because of the topics covered.  I have never really understood about the people \\"below stairs\\" I mean other than like movies like Remains of the day and the mountain of BBC programs I watch.  I have never understood what the various positions are but I have learned alot watching the series, which I got from the library, I am totally in love with it.  Being that it is one of the better shows that I have watched in a long time, including the ones that are on television currently.  I am trying to find some things that I haven't ever seen before and this one was so highly recommended by so many sources, including my listmania of Top Masterpiece Theatre presentations.  This one is awesome, I can't wait to watch the other four seasons.<br />One word sums it up...drama.  Love it!
1579126278|5.0|As a passionate Christie fan, I own and have read all of her books (80+), many of them two or three times.  The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is longer than most of her books so it has a little \\"filler,\\" as I call it:  pages of writing which could be left out without affecting the plot or progression of the book.  For example, a long chapter is devoted to a Mah Jong game in which the only plot extender is the divulgence of the discovery of a wedding ring.  But ever her \\"fillers\\" are fascinating.  The book is about the murder of wealthy country gentleman Roger Ackroyd just as he is about to discover who has been blackmailing his friend and possible future wife, who has left him a letter telling all before committing suicide.  Everyone in the house with him at the time of his death is a suspect and clues are abundant, as always.  Hercule Poirot has recently moved to the little village of King Abbott and is asked by the victim's neice to find the killer.  As usual he sifts through clues and observes the reactions of the suspects and discovers the killer whom he confronts.   I love Christie's quaint descriptions of English country life and her dialogue that precisely identifies the characters.  She's the master of mystery fiction; more than 2 billion copies of her books have been sold, with good reason.  It doesn't get any better than this.
0812979656|1.0|I always make it a point to read the Booker Prize winner selections and normally I am not disappointed.  This book was definitely a major disappointment however.  As an avid reader who generally reads at least one book a week; this book two me nearly three weeks to get through.  As I was reading, I would find myself mentally making grocery lists, remembering things I needed to get done, etc. because I was so bored. There were several times I would be ready to throw it in the garbage and then I would read the reviews and think, \\"Well, maybe it will get better soon.\\"  Forget it!  It didn't.  I love me an adjective as much as the next person but this was ridiculous.  Most of the time, the writer would go off on some adjective-ridden tangent and three pages later you would be left trying to remember what had been going on in the story.  A story with no plot I might add.  And if I read one more fragmented sentence I was going to scream.  Two hundred pages of flowery descriptions aside, you found yourself not caring about the characters at all nor caring about what happened to them.  I could go on for three hundred pages with how much I didn't like this book but I'll be smarter than the author and stop with a final recommendation - don't waste your time.  There are thousands of other wonderful books out there just waiting to be read.
1591841992|5.0|Have you ever been in a meeting where people just talk past each other?   They are not really speaking the same language. They could be talking about a bus but one person is talking about the front of the bus and the other person is talking about the back of the bus. If you could just draw a picture to anchor everyone's attention on the same thing can be very useful.     Back of the Nakpin helps to provide a framework to be able to do that. Calling out what types of images to create, and the various forms those images can take as to denote the most meaning.     I use the framework presented in the book all the time, and when people who just moments before were not describing the same thing have an \\"Oh\\" the cost of the book and the time invested is paid for again many times over.

0345472322|4.0|Do you believe your intelligence is fixed at an early age or that you can -with focused effort - continuously improve your intelligence?     Carol Dweck, a Stanford psychologist, lays out in this book how the \\"Fixed Mindset\\" result in less rick taking, less personal growth, ineffective management and leadership styles.  By adapting what Dweck calls a \\"Growth Mindset\\" you can improve your outlook and take situations as opportunities to learn and grow.  Even failure can be seen in the light as growth opportunities. Nothing ventured nothing gained; don't think you as struggling or failing - think you are learning.  The view your adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life.    Dweck writes, \\"believing your qualities are fixed in stone creates an urgency to prove yourself over and over again. If you have a certain amt of intelligence, a certain personality, a certain moral character - well, then you better prove you have a healthy dose of them. It simply won't look good to feel deficient in these most basic characteristics.  For the fixed mindset, every situation calls for a confirmation of their intelligence, personality or character. Every situation of evaluated: Will I succeed or will I fail? Will I look smart or dumb? Will I be accepted or rejected? Will I fell like a winner or a loser?\\"    In contrast, Dweck says, the growth mindset asserts that the characteristics you are born with are just a starting point for your development. The growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.  Instead of hiding your deficiencies, by working on them, you can overcome them.  The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it even when, or especially when, things aren't going well is the hallmark of the growth mindset.  Challenge yourself and don't underestimate the importance of effort in achieving your goals.    Interesting read and I agree that by believing you can achieve your goals andtaking concrete steps to achieve them, you can.  I found, however, Dweck takes vast leaps in saying the downfall of Chrysler is due to their \\"fixed mindset\\".  Dweck also postulates the failure of Enron can to attributed to their \\"fixed mindset\\".  These are huge companies and I feel there is a lot more to it than the psychology of their CEO.     Dweck points to to Japanese and the success of Toyota as having a \\"growth mindset\\".  I could agree that Toyota is a more healthy organization that appears to value the contribution of all staff from the assembly line worker to the plant manager to VP's and CEO's.  It's not, though, all about their \\"growth mindset\\".    I thought the parts about teaching children was good and the advice to \\"praise the person and praise the effort not their smarts/intelligence/personal attributes\\".  Praise the study habits, the strategies and persistence in sticking to goals.  Dweck found that kids react positively in the teaching environment when they hear skill achievement comes from commitment and effort (not pure smarts).  Dweck notes, great teachers believe in the growth of the intellect and talent and are fascinated by the process of learning.  They are also noted too set high standards for their students.  As one teacher stated, success does not come to you; you must come to it.  Challenge and nurture the student.  Teach them to love learning as lifelong learning is key to a happy and healthy life.    The parts about sports and how Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan were not only the best players but the hardest workers who always worked on the game to get better (especially working on their weak points).  Also, when success comes to them, they don't allow themselves to get complacent.    Overall, this is a good book and teaches me to keep an open mind, stay flexible and, overall, not stop learning how to improve both personally and professionally.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|2007's \\"Beowulf\\" is an animated film version of the epos featuring motion-capture technology which films real-life actors (Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn) and places them into the animated picture. Although this is a \\"cartoon\\" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture, featuring ultra-brutal violence and open sexual situations & dialogue (BOTH the rated and unrated versions).<br /><br />The film has the same characters as the epic poem -- Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon -- and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's \\"sea hag\\" mother and the dragon; other than this the film strongly deviates from the classic poem. Needless to say, don't watch this if you're a Beowulf purist -- you'll be both offended and disappointed.<br /><br />However, if you don't mind the animation or a re-imagining of the epic story and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, I recommend catching \\"Beowulf.\\" It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching this version and 2005's \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" back-to-back; the latter film is a live-action version featuring Gerard Butler in the titular role and filmed on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland (seriously, it's worth viewing just for the stunning location photography). This Gerard Butler version omits the third Act with the dragon and adds a Nordic witch character, effectively played by Sarah Polley.<br /><br />One of the main statements of the 2007 animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend, which has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero in this version but this isn't true. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't a hero, what is? Okay, so he exagerrates his past exploits and has a weakness for babes, what else is new?<br /><br />I should add here that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title (\\"What We Need Is A Hero\\" -- Tracks 1 & 4 on the soundtrack cd) and the two versions of \\"A Hero Comes Home\\" (the first is the shorter/simpler version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits).<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT! The rest of this review explores the meanings behind the story and gives away important plot elements]<br /><br />I'll be honest with you, although I was entertained the first time I saw \\"Beowulf\\" I came away from it thinking \\"Huh?\\" This version makes King Hrothgar the father of Grendel and Beowulf the father of the dragon, making it absurd in a what-were-they-thinking way, but also highly creative. Whether you see it one way or the other -- or both -- depends on the individual and how you look at it.<br /><br />Viewing the picture a second time, I was intent on figuring it out and gleaning the moral(s) of the story. The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.<br /><br />Other points include:<br /><br />- The mistakes of your past will inevitably come back to haunt you.<br />- Apart from redemption, the \\"sins of the fathers\\" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally!).<br />- Even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws.<br />- Deal with and put to rest your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt & shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead (see the final paragraph below).<br />- Offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter thecost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak.<br />- Men are easily entranced by a beautiful babe, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions.<br />- A beautiful woman can turn a man into a loaf of bread.<br />- The importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.<br /><br />Some things to think about: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is he able to morph back-and-forth at will? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?<br /><br />Some criticize that Beowulf is no longer a Christ-figure in this account, which isn't accurate. Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only \\"weeping martyrs,\\" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer, who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in \\"Beowulf\\" was created via Beowulf and is later revealed as a hideous dragon.<br /><br />All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even ultra-heroes like Beowulf, which -- again -- is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about \\"weeping martyrs\\" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement (see below). Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.<br /><br />One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, \\"KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!\\" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invunerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending proves he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality, my friend. Who would have expected this in a \\"cartoon\\"?<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: B+by a beautiful babe, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions.  - A beautiful woman can turn a man into a loaf of bread.  - The importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.

B00005JO20|2.0|Don't mess with a legend.<br />Especially a movie so iconic and mythical as the original l933 King Kong. The reason its become a much beloved legend,TV staple is that it only runs 112 minutes and it moves so fast that you just sit there, stunned, as the excitement builds steadily until that unforgettable death of King Kong.<br /><br />Peter Jackson spent over 200 million dollars on this nearly 4 hour epic--when at least two hours could have easily been cut. Instead, we spend nearly an hour, stuck in the beginning in NYC, as we watch long, never-ending backstories of each of the main characters.<br /><br />Then we have to watch a miserably miscast gallery of performers. All of them are talented in their own way, but Naomi Watts is so atheletic and feisty as Ann Darrow that we can't really sympathize with her plight. It was Fay Wray's fragile but sensuous beauty that made her a perfect heroine. Jack Black is hideously midcast as voyage leader, Carl Denham. You keep waiting for him to break into one of his potty-saturated routines. Instead, he comes across as some smarmy, sneaky creep.<br /><br />One grows incresingly bored at the long, never-ending shots of Naomi Watts face. She stares at Adrian Brody--her sweetheart--in long, endless takes. When she's not staring at Adrian Brody, she stares for endless minutes at King Kong. Toward the end, nearly half an hour is spent as the camera never leaves her staring face and then this is repeated with King Kong staring at Ann Darrow. Back and forth, stares galore, and I kept looking at the clock. Then we see Jack Black's face--with the camera studying his every pore as he stares intently at something beyond the camera range. One minute passes, then another, then a third of Jack Black's face--all for what?<br /><br />The sequence that really made me groan in disbelief is the big moment when King Kong is unveiled at a NYC theater. Instead of Ann Darrow as the star performer, they have a fake Ann Darrow. The real one, for reasons never explained, is performing in a chorus line down the street. Wouldn't you expect that someone like Ann Darrow, a struggling stage performer, would want to share in the spotlight with King kong? Adrian Brody is also in another theater watching his drama unfold. Yet, throughout the movie, he has been one of the action characters, who helps bring Kong back to NYC. I couldn't imagine anyone in NYC at that time wanting to sit through a boring dramatic play when King Kong is being presented live just down the street.<br /><br />If this movie had two hours pruned from it, this might save it, but for me, one time was much too much to watch this dazzling epic, that quickly bores with its illogic story line and staring performers.a chorus line down the street.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|The movie is superbly done. Jolie is magnificient as the mother who strives against a corrupt system to bring justice. The sets, the location, and the pacing are all very good. However, I can't say I enjoyed the movie. It is a hard movie to watch. The topics are kidnapping, corruption, and mass murder. The emotional impact is brought home with gritty realism.    In summary, I strongly recommend watching the movie. The movie is about heroism and bravery in face of fantastic odds. The movie is extremely well done. However, I don't know if I recommend buying it. It is very hard hitting and disturbing movie in some ways. The realism is the strength of the movie. I would recommend renting it and then buying it.
015603252X|3.0|Amos Oz is one of Israel's best known novelists; some label him as Israel's \\"number one\\". Any new book by Oz gets the immediate attention of everyone, gets translated to several languages and hits the no. 1 spot in the bestsellers list almost immediately. Indeed, Oz has become an icon in Israel to whom many turn to, not only to discuss literary matters but also get his opinion on politics, society and life in general. As my wife says, he has become a \\"sacred cow\\", elevated to a status where it has become extremely difficult for any critic to harm sales of his books in any significant way.<br /><br />I read A Tale of Love and Darkness (in Hebrew) during my trip in New Zealand and it accompanied me throughout the journey. It is an autobiography that Oz started writing shortly after he turned 60, at the end of the previous century. It tells mainly the story of his childhood in Jerusalem, growing up during the time Israel was being formed (Oz was 9 when Israel gained independence). Although the book covers many aspects of his life, the one overriding theme surfacing over and over again is the suicide of his mother when he was 12. This event shaped Oz's life and led to the abrupt change he embarked upon two years later: the move from the book-centric, scholarly life of his father in Jerusalem to the freedom and agricultural life of Kibbutz Hulda.<br /><br />Oz's writing is at times long-winded and pompous. Even daily, mundane events are recounted in excruciating detail that sometimes make the reader wonder whether they indeed made such an impact on his life to deserve such attention. Despite this, Oz manages to combine tragedy and comedy in his family's saga and his occasional self-effacing manner make the reader forgive him for his long-windedness. Throughout the book, the leading figures of Israel as a young nation pop up: Bialik, Tchernikhowsky, Agnon, Ben-Gurion and Yadin all came and went in Oz's childhood.<br /><br />The book is more of a memoir than an autobiography. The storyline is not linear and Oz repeats some events several times. If we ignore the fact that Oz wrote this book and thus remove the \\"sacred cow\\" factor, the book is an enjoyable read and contributes to the understanding of how Ashkenazi Jews coped with their new life in the Middle East.linear and Oz repeats some events several times.

B001LRJH0U|2.0|Hollywood has really lost touch with the Western genre in recent years.  I believe Ed Harris made a sincere attempt of recreating a Western in the classic vein but the results are very disappointing.  Apparently, I'm in a minority among other reviewers here but as much as I had great expectations for this film, it really fell flat.  The great cast doesn't jell well together and the script was either poorly adapted from the Robert Parker novel or possibly the direction of Mr. Harris simply wasn't up to the task.  Very disappointing.
1400032717|4.0|Christopher is fifteen years old. He lives in Swindon, England, with his father. He knows all the prime numbers up to 7,057. He can name all the countries in the world, and their capital cities. He hates the colours yellow and brown. He loves animals and keeps a pet rat, Toby. Soon he's going to be sitting his Maths A-level.<br /><br />But Christopher has behavioural problems: he does not like being touched; he smashes things and screams when he gets angry or confused; he never smiles; and he refuses to eat food if it is touching another sort of food. Christopher is autistic.<br /><br />One night, Christopher discovers his neighbour's poodle, Wellington, lying dead in the garden. Christopher decides to become a detective and find the killer. This book is his story. Because he cannot comprehend figures of speech or use sarcasm or even imagine things which did not happen, Christopher writes this book as a series of faithfully recorded conversations and observations. A detailed diary of this thoughts and actions.<br /><br />Haddon's debut novel is a disturbing book. Although it is funny in parts it is awfully sad in others. The author succeeds in exposing to the reader the world of an autistic child (Haddon worked with autistics) by avoiding the pitfalls of excessive sentimentalism or exploitation of a sensitive subject. It is easy to fall in love with Christopher, who needs to cope not only with his disability but also with a dysfunctional family that is breaking apart around him.<br /><br />I can only hope that when the movie version of this book is made, it will not be a soppy schmaltz like \\"Rain Man\\".
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I must say, I was a bit apprehensive at watching this movie after the mixed reviews.  I'm glad I took the plunge.<br /><br />The movie is beautiful in so many ways:<br /><br />a) the scenery of Australia<br />b) the directing which is just beautiful<br />c) the Wizard of Oz that is woven into the movie<br />d) the homages to movies gone by like Casablanca and other movies of the 30s through 60s<br />e) the vastness of the story... from formal life in almost Victorian England to Western style cattle rustling in the outback to the grand tapestry of World War II.<br />f) the peace offering to the Aboriginal people of Australia (finally)<br />g) the great acting by Hugh and Nicole<br />h) strong figures (both Nicole and Hugh play complex strong roles) - a boon for women's rights (finally, two lovers on equal footing for different reasons)<br /><br />This movie is vast and long and has drama, adventure, serious overtones....I watched it at home on a rainy day and after the movie credits rolled, I wondered whether it was Tuesday or whether the rain was over -- it was that engrossing.<br /><br />If you only enjoy the Vin Diesel kick butt movies of today without a plot or if you only enjoy cop shows or sci fi or comedies, Australia might not be for you but if you enjoy BIG Broad stories about our humanity set in a different more romantic time and want to learn a bit about that vast land down under called Australia - then definitely get this movie.<br /><br />I'm buying it and putting it next to Wizard of Oz, Australia, North by Northwest, and all the other classics of yesteryear - BEAUTIFUL.

B001CZJKS0|4.0|Basically this is every DVD release that Anchor Bay has the rights to, packaged together.  The box art is pretty good, but they didn't add any new special features.  You only get one disc of 25 Years of Terror, but as far as I can ascertain by reading other reviews, they just stuck 2 discs worth on 1 disc, so I'm not sure if there's anything missing.  Probably not anything of great consequence, anyway.  If you already have all the DVD releases, forget it.  I didn't have any of them yet so it was a great purchase.  You also get Halloween on Blu-Ray.  Yay.  I don't have a Blu-Ray player, so whatever.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Here's a typical exchange: \\"Do you have kids?\\"/\\"No\\"/\\"You'd make a great father\\"/\\"Do you have kids\\"/\\"No, I can't.\\"/\\"That's too bad; you'd make a great mother.\\" All the while with camera shots hanging interminably long on meaningless meaningful glances and a music score that seems to be composed by someone who knew that they had to compensate for empty dialogue.  A soaring music crescendo is the only clue that an emotional peak in the movie was supposed to have just occured -- you'd never have guessed it from the blather that comes out of the actors' mouths.    Think about dialogue in the average David Mamet or Aaron Sorkin (West Wing) show.  It's witty, intelligent, psychologically realistic.  Then think about the opposite. This movie is the opposite.    And the plot is terrible as well: it's a patchwork of predictable cliches and bizzare non sequiturs.  Contemplative loner finishes a bar fight he didn't start; local keystone cop is crooked; Jackman gallops through the front yard with a herd of wild horses apparently for the mere sport of it.  -- cue the music, again.    If you must watch it at least turn the volume down for relief from the painful dialogue and the incongruous music, and just enjoy the pretty Australian vistas and either the still-hot-after-all-these-years Kidman or the frequently shirtless Jackman, depending on your proclivities.
B000002U82|5.0|My husband and I recently \\"revisited\\" Pink Floyd by watching several videos of concerts and interviews via netflix.com, particularly the \\"Pulse\\" concert of 1994. Wonderfully over the top. We had been sad to hear of Richard Wright's death, so it was good to see him play. The concerts were fun to watch but just listening to Pink Floyd's music again has been the best. It is still enjoyable, tantalizing, and satisfying, especially this CD of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" - still an enduring classic that has simply stood the test of time.
015626224X|5.0|Perhaps the left-leaning Orwell set about this book as a way of drawing political attention to the plight of the poor.  But, thanks to the wonderful writing of Orwell, the book is much more than that.  It is a record of Paris and London in the early 20th century.  It is a description of the grit and life of the working-poor, and their voices and concerns.  It brings to life bosses and building, the taste of cheap food, and the feel of bed after a long day.  To be sure this is the original [[ASIN:0805088385 Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America]]: there isn't much escape from this world--no matter how hard one works, there's little hope to save or invest or prosper.  There is only the thanklessness of work and the hope of little extras--a chance find, a stumbled upon bonus.  Yet, for all of the bleakness of Paris and London and dishwashing and lousy bosses, there is something wonderfully compelling about this book.  For anyone who has every done menial work or who wants to understand the big-city pains of the working poor, this book is still fresh and vital and great to read.
B00003CX9E|1.0|First, let me say that if film critics had a full proof method for judging films then they'd all agree on every movie, but of course as we all know, they don't. This proves that it all comes down to taste and that a critic's taste -on average- is no better or worse than anyone elses. This film, for some inexplicable reason, has been built up over the years by the pretentious set as an icon of cinematic excellence. These are the same type of people who probably think Pablo Picasso was a great artist. Not because they have the intellect or taste to judge him a great artist, but because other misguided people have influenced their weak minds. It is time for the truly reasonable among us to finally stand up and proclaim that,\\"The Emperor is not wearing any clothes!\\" In other words, Citizen Kane is an extremely boring, dated and grossly overrated film that was a commercial failure in its day.(It lost its studio,RKO, $150,000) Which just goes to show, people had much better taste back then.
0525951113|4.0|Daemon as it applies to Computer Science is defined by dictionary.com as:<br /><br />  A program or process that sits idly in the background until it is invoked to perform its task.<br /><br />And that's exactly what this Daemon does. It sits idly in the background until computer genius Matthew Sobol dies of brain cancer. Upon his death and subsequent obituary notice, his Daemon is unleashed on the world in a bloody, twisting, turning path of suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />This story took off from the first page and it kept me guessing. I'd say it kept me guessing up until the end, except there really was no end. The sequel, Freedom, is due out in 2010.<br /><br />There is a lot of technology talk and gamer-speak involved in the book but I didn't find that it hindered my enjoyment of the book. In most cases, the context of the story gave me a general idea of the meaning. The rest my gamer-nerd son filled in for me.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about the plot because it would be easy to accidentally give a spoiler. If you like technology, suspense, and intrigue then I can recommend Daemon.
B001P50HOI|5.0|When I saw that Yes finally released the CD for Symphonic Live I was thrilled.  This was an amazing tour and the DVD captured it perfectly. For long time fans the orchestration of these epic pieces is a nice change of pace and really adds to their power - especially Close to the Edge, Gates and Ritual.  Tom Brislin is also an underrated keyboard player and did a great job filling in for Rick Wakeman. It is a must have for all long time Yes fans.
B001O8C5KK|5.0|This is not the stereotypical studio recording (rare as those now are).  It's a really alive, probing, exciting and moving rendition of this music.  The pictures of Gheorghiu might suggest a glossy fashion zine, but she pours her heart and soul into this recording;  she clearly loves the role and the music and has given it her very best.  Kaufmann sounds unlike any Italian tenor in this music but I find him utterly convincing.  The supporting cast emphasizes vivid character over vocal glamour, but all are razor sharp in their awareness of every nuance of the music and text.  Pappano creates an extraordinarily controlled musical framework that allows all of the elements room to breath, but also keeps the tension high.      I'll put up with the extraneous sounds to get the effect of this kind of open-mike recording in which all of the forces are in the same hall at the same time, hearing each other and responding to each other.  The sound harkens back to the era of the great Mercury Living Presence and RCA Living Stereo recordings in its impact and naturalness.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|\\"Scream\\" is actually not as big of a departure from Cornell's previous work as one might expect, given the hype and the Timbaland connection.  To be sure, the usual heavy guitars here give way to synthesizers and drum machines.  But, for instance the tracks \\"Time,\\" \\"Ground Zero,\\" \\"Never Far Away,\\" and \\"Enemy,\\" among others, could have easily been added to any previous Cornell album.  You just have to imagine the riffs being played by electric guitars rather than keyboards, and those songs really start to sound familiar (if you're into Cornell).  More broadly speaking, many of Cornell's trademarks are on display here: the showy vocal delivery, the wonderfully disconnected and abstract lyrics, the somewhat abrupt chord changes, the very melodic bridges, etc.    \\"Time\\" is a wonderful meditation on aging, with a rather catchy chorus.  \\"Ground Zero\\" is another strong track, with an expressive melody and creatively looped vocal snippets.  The hidden track, \\"Two Drink Minimum,\\" a quiet bluesy number, that would feel quite at home on \\"Euphoria Morning,\\" by itself makes the album worth the price. Unfortunately these fine tunes have to share the CD with some that sound hopelessly sappy to my ears.  I'm particularly thinking of the title track and \\"Long Gone\\" here.    On the whole, while \\"Scream\\" does not reach the heights achieved on, say, \\"Superunknown\\" or have the consistency of \\"Euphoria Morning,\\" it is still a worthy addition to the Cornell catalog, and it is much more satisfying than his previous album \\"Carry On.\\"  Incidentally, \\"Scream\\" and \\"Carry On\\" can in some sense be thought of as companion pieces.  Many of the songs on \\"Carry On\\" deal with newlywed bliss, whereas many of those on \\"Scream\\" are about the pitfalls of more established relationships.
B000DZ6VAK|4.0|Truly an outstanding set, I would rate it equal to Geza Anda's classic set and superior to Perahia, Buchbinder and Barenboim for complete sets. Of course, there are individual discs which I prefer by Curzon, Haskil, Serkin, Casadeseus, Kempff etc. Unfortunately none of these legendary Mozartians made complete sets, especially Curzon, who in my opinion was without equal in these works.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Turk and Rooster (feel free to cringe) are a couple of veteran cops, who've been handed a doozy of a case: a serial killer with a badge; or, as young detective Perez makes a point of saying, \\"It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop!\\" A video-taped confession by Turk doesn't quite seal the deal; after all, once we hear his confession, we have an hour and a half of movie left, and believe me, it's full of twists and turns and bullets and blood and gratuitous violence and freaky sex.<br /><br />\\"Righteous Kill\\" isn't at all what it could have been, and that is a damn shame.  Pacino is as enthusiastic and enjoyable as ever; De Niro appears to be sleep-walking at times, though he has his moments (does anyone else think he should team with Scorsese again?).  John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg are good as younger detectives investigating the same case (though I wonder if four detectives wold be allowed to share the lead on a single case); and Carla Gugino is enjoyable as Turk's freaky girlfriend.  Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent) isn't half bad, though I believe that's because he only has a little screen time.  Brian Dennehy, as the police captain, is a pure pleasure to watch as always; his scenes with De Niro and Pacino (Pacino especially) are the best in the film.<br /><br />The \\"twist\\" here (the main one, that is) is clever and intriguing, but it's bogged down by shoddy directing and an overly-ambitious script.  The fault isn't with the actors, it's with the people behind the scenes.  To put it simply, \\"Righteous Kill\\" is a second-rate film starring first-rate talent.  It's a shame, that THIS is the movie Pacino and De Niro finally decide to make together.  Maybe they'll collaborate again, in the near future, on a film that is worthy of their immense talents.
B0013FNC38|5.0|I enjoyed every song on the cd.  All the songs seem to be happy and light. I have a cd player in my kitchen and this is where I listen to it the most.  It puts you in a good mood even if you are washing dishes.  Well worth the price.
1439136653|4.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" (Or \\"Q&A\\", as it was originally entitled) chronicles the life and times of Ram Mohammad Thomas, an orphan raised by a Catholic priest, let loose upon the Indian slums, who eventually goes on to win a billion rupees on a new Indian game show.  Ram has been arrested for fraud (no one can believe an uneducated waiter could know all the answers), and his saved by a female lawyer who proposes he tell his story, so everything can be set straight.  The novel is that story: snippets of Ram's life, told as they relate to the answers he gave on the game show, that meander through the lower class underbelly of Indian society.  Ram's story is one of murder, espionage, and moral corruption that is as thoroughly disturbing as the author intends it to be.<br /><br />The result is an engrossing modern day fairytale.  Ram is the flawed hero; there's no doubt he's a good guy--he never does anything very wrong, or at least nothing unforgivable--but he is born into a world without sainthood, a world where vice and sin are a part of everyday life.  Taken on this level, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is a thoroughly engaging read.  True, on a technical level, Vikas Swarup isn't that great of a writer; the novel is told in first-person present-tense, which as any writer knows is a very hard verb tense to keep track of, and Swarup often gets lost within the complexities.  That, and much of the dialogue is stilted, unrealistic.  And the plot, too, is wholly unbelievable.  But \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is meant as an allegory of sorts, a fanciful rendition of the power of triumph through tragedy.  As such, it is a novel that leaves you with the Horatio Alger sense that anyone, from all walks of life, can rise to the top--because, in the end, the best man wins.  It's not a very realistic portrait of the world, but it's enthusiastic and engrossing, and makes for a fine novel with some socially-conscious underpinnings.

B001N26GFM|5.0|THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS is a 'compleat' motion picture: even the title states the vision of the film in a subtly powerful way. Based on the excellent novel by John Boyne and adapted for the screen by director Mark Herman, this film has the courage to re-visit the Holocaust from the child's perspective.  Not that it covers up the atrocities of that horrid event and time - quite the opposite: in electing to examine that period in history the stance is that of two children, one German son of an officer in Hitler's armed forces and one son of a Jewish captive living with his father in a concentration camp.  The juxtaposition of these two eight year old boys separated not only by a fence but by an ideology neither of them can fathom the other's side makes for not only a brilliant film but also an unforgettable emotional experience.<br /><br /> Bruno (Asa Butterfield in an extraordinary performance) is eight, his sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) is twelve and the two live with their parents in 1940 Berlin - father (David Thewlis) is a Komandant in  Hitler's army and mother (Vera Farminga) is a popular socialite and loving mother.  Father is 'promoted' and will be in charge of a new 'position' that means moving from their beautiful Berlin home to a 'home in the country'. Though Bruno doesn't want to leave his friends the family does indeed move - to a cold house next to what Bruno perceives is a farm. The father is forbidden to share his role and the meaning of it with his family, but it soon becomes obvious by the smoke stacks spewing hideously smelling odors into the atmosphere that the 'farm' is a concentration camp. The house servant Pavel (David Hayman), though abused by the father, becomes Bruno's friend when Bruno sustains an injury: Pavel quietly admits to Bruno that despite his 'pajama' uniform from the 'farm' that he practiced medicine in the past.  Bored, Bruno explores the forbidden area outside his home confines and finds a barbed wire electrified fence behind which sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who becomes Bruno's friend.  Neither lad understands the differences between them until Shmuel is sent into Bruno's household to polish glasses for a party: the armed forces chauffeur Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend) beats the 'little filthy Jew' for eating pastries Bruno has shared with him - a fact that the terrified Bruno denies.<br /><br />The mother discovers the truth about the 'farm' and the smoke stacks and sinks into a depression, loathing that her husband is in charge of such atrocities.  Gretel becomes transformed as a Hitler youth under the influence of the children's tutor (Jim Norton) and there are obvious philosophical schisms in the family.  Bruno, regretting his treatment of Shmuel, continues to sneak food to him and plans to help his young friend save Shmuel's father: Bruno digs into the 'farm' and the results bring the film to a terrifying and abrupt end.<br /><br />Both young actors give enormously moving performances and the manner in which Herman directs the action underlines the blur of perception many German's had about the reality of the Final Solution.  But for what this viewer perceives as the reason the film sustains the powerful message it does is the manner in which it ends. There are no attempts to 'sanitize' this film: it simply ends with a lightning bolt jolt that is one of the most powerful statements in all of the many films about the Holocaust.  It is simply a brilliant masterpiece of a movie from every aspect of judging it - acting, direction, music, cinematography, editing - and why this film failed to make an impression on the critics and public (and the Oscar folks!) when it was released in the theaters remains a conundrum.  Highly recommended for all audiences. Grady Harp, March 09hich sits Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who becomes Bruno's friend.

B0012Q732O|1.0|For all the hype that was about this movie it was a huge disappointment. It's one of those films where they spent a huge budget on special effects and wrote the script as an after thought. The story line was horrible. Guess they figured people would be so awed by everything else they wouldn't care that it's nothing but a really bad love story.
B000002C4J|4.0|Following the specacular album \\"Falling into You\\", Celine Dion released her last great album of the 1990s, \\"Let's Talk About Love\\". The record truly reflects its title; love is a common theme weaving the tracks into a cohesive whole. In typical Dion fashion, Celine has included many tender tracks and power ballads that were her trademark in the last decade of the millennium. But the songs are good - and that's what makes this one stand the test of time.    There's no doubt that the album was buoyed by 'My Heart Will Go On', the theme song from smash film 'Titanic'. And, despite its incessant radio play during 1997, it really is a great song. Another gem on the record is 'To Love You More' - though it didn't really make it as a single in the US, it is a bright piece where Celine's voice duels with a violin. Other highlights include the Bee Gee's duet 'Immortality', power ballad 'Us', and the Corey Hart piece 'Where is the Love'. With its exotic drum beats and hopeful lyrics, it is a beautiful vocal performance.    Are there any \\"bad\\" tracks on the album? No. There are, admittedly, some that are dated - the cheesy duet 'Tell Him' with Barbara Streisand has never been a favorite of mine, and both 'Treat Her Like a Lady' and 'Just a Little Bit of Love' are rather flat attempts at dance tunes. It would be about five years before Celine would master that genre, and it's obvious that she's struggling here. But it doesn't matter, because the rest of the album more than makes up for its shortcomings.    Heading into the year 2000, there was no artist on the planet as big as Celine Dion. Why? The success of this album is one of the many reasons. Give it another listen. You might be surprised by how good it still is.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|I find it very strange that Angelina Jolie could pull off such a stunning performance. The film has the sort of script which doesn't really flow but in it's innate stillness the film finds something quite remarkable. Jolie's always been at best a second-rate actress but this film's remarkable end managed to sinch a lot of emotions out of me. The film is deeply engaging and somehow with powerful performances stands out. There is no respite, this will make you feel bad for the character, it's also reflective of the sort of police in those days. It is very difficult to write a review, I had no idea the film was directed by Clint Eastwood. Frost Nixon was one of the best films I saw last year but this film was somehow better despite lacking irony, it had a lot of emotional subtance. Although I haven't finished watching Reader, I feel Angelina Jolie was robbed off the oscar this year. A truly remarkable film. I cried quite a few tears. Who wants to be right as a rain?
B0019UGYK0|5.0|First of all, I found the Amazon.com Editorial Review to be quite silly, appealing apparently to those who are totally unfamiliar w/the 60s but yet familiar w/the 70s. Movie critics have recently voted Cool Hand Luke as \\"One of the Finest movies ever made.\\" And it does deserve that standing. It and it alone--yes over \\"The Graduate\\", a fine 60s film in its own right, but not definitive--can serve as an excellent defiition of the 60s.     People constantly refer to Newman's character \\"Luke\\" as a \\"rebel\\". Yet this characterization reflects our society's actual fear of defying authority in itself. Luke isn't a 'rebel'. He's perfectly willing to follow sensible, reasonale orders and just 'get along'. What he doesn't abide is Abuse of authority. He didn't rebel against authority for it's own sake. He refuses to accept Injustice, if even on the most minor levels--injustices we know well and all(?) routinely accept as if we're powerless. By accepting them we become sheep easily led to slaughter, for acceptance of minor abuses quickly leads to, and indicates the certainty of underlying, serious intolerable abuses (ala George W. Bush & Nixon). To paraphrase the guard upset on hearing Luke's supposed disbelief in G/god: 'I've worked this chain gang for nearly 30 year and I ain't killed me no white man....Sorry Luke but I'm just doin' my job.\\" \\"Callin it your job don't make it right, Boss\\", replies Luke.     Luke not only takes on the prison institution, leaders and guards, but also the chain gang's self-appointed 'Boss' prisoner 'Dragline' (George Kennedy). Here the film argues for a more egalitarian society: They are, after all, prisoners, every one. Questioning Dragline's authority, results in a boxing match Luke knows he'll loose. But he fight anyway, is beaten badly, yet won't \\"stay down\\" as warned. Luke replies, \\"you're gonna have to kill me first.\\"  By being beaten but refusing to give up he wins the fight and everyone's respect. The warden recognizes Luke's righteousness resistance as trouble to come. Later, after being seriuosly wronged by the warden in the opinion of all, Luke never gives up trying to escape.     The movie takes up a third overarching issue of belief, or lack of belief, in God & in combination implies Luke's 'rebeliousness' stems from his 'non-belief'. Made in the time of the infamous \\"God is Dead\\" headline and the \\"anti-hero\\", both strong players explored here with much religious symbolism, the film is just as relevant today as 40+ years ago. Does Luke actually not believe in God? Or is it those who don't really think for themselves who are 'guilty'? Some may feel as if Luke's character feels \\"the world owed him something\\", as individualists (rebels?) are often pegged. Perhaps Luke feels unquestioned belief in God leads to acceptance of abuse (\\"..I ain't killed no white man.\\") when all 'follow the leader'. The aftermath of the escape scenes lead to a much-needed review of the morality of torture (ocurring everyday in our prisons).    This film is a powerful call to acccept and follow the idealism inherent in America's founding principles of freedom: Be a true individual. Think for yourself. Stand up and fight for what you believe no matter what the odds, consequences or opponents (even God?). This is a movie that will make you think. I saw it as a teen in 67 and it helped change my life. Society is again in great need of hearing it's message.     Thought-provoking and profound, with excellent, sometimes experimental cinematography and a brilliant screenplay deserving of an Oscar itself (it and the novel both written by a former chain gang member), an all-star ensemble supporting cast and the seamless Oscar-deserving performances of Newman and Kennedy, it will stand for all times as one of the best and most important movies ever made.  (for Liz and Graciela)
B000PFT1ZU|5.0|This is the ultimate in Lou Reed albums.  Every song is packed full of dark, powerful lyrics, accented with beautiful shimmering performances and production is the high water mark of juxtaposition. Music accompanied by Steve Winwood, Tony Levin, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, the Brecker brothers, Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner (of Alice Cooper fame), this star studded line up proves a worthy adversary to Reed's strung out main character's delivery.  The contrast of the beautiful music, the dark lyrics of drug abuse, physical abuse, and promiscuous sexual behavior, with the extremely deadpan delivery (I hesitate to call it singing), just pushes the impact home so much more.  The pristine music almost buries Reed's lyrics, signifying the overwhelming nature of the  story line on our main character, the character's psyche being lost in the deluge of jealousy, disgust, apathy, and feelings that he can never escape this nightmare.  Not to mention the songs are wonderful, BY FAR his most consistent effort since the VU.  If you weren't hooked sooner, by THE KIDS and SAD SONG, there is no escaping the deluge and the listener is sucked in.    Whether you are having a bad day and need to be reassured that it isn't that bad, or are just looking for a dark drama of literary or cinematic scope, you can't go wrong with BERLIN.  After all, if you are already a  Reed fan, you obviously have tastes that run towards the dark side.  Yes, the pristine music performances are not his MO and to those who are accustomed to his other work, this might take some getting use to, but if you give it a chance, this will prove to be the most rewarding and profound Reed work of his solo career, the scope of which is only revealed upon repeated listens.
B001EOOC3W|5.0|I can only try to be helpful so that you can make up your own mind as to whether or not to purchase this 37 CD set.<br />1.  There is included a 50 page booklet that contains only a listing of the compositions and performers.  There is nothing about the composer and no words to any of the singing, including the operas.  EMI should be ashamed.<br />2.  The 37 discs are divided approximately as follows:  10 orchestral, 6 chamber, 11 church, songs, and choral, 10 opera.<br />3.  All performances are excellent, including the War Requiem and 5 operas.<br />4.  A dedicated Britten fan will have to obtain the booklet or a similar listing in order to determine how many of the selections would be duplicative of discs presently owned.<br />5.  The purchaser not too familiar with Britten will have to decide if he wants to buy so many discs that feature the voice, particularly since no words are printed.<br />6.  Based on the quality of the performances (EMI recordings) and the price (about $2.00 per disc) this is an amazing bargain and for that  reason alone rates 5 stars.

There were 3 items packed in: A BOOK, a POSTER, and a FIGURINE. We'll take them one at a time.<br /><br />BOOK<br />This \\"Production Journal\\" is a very cheap little paper pamphlet with 4 (FOUR!?!) smallish pages. It's printed (somewhat poorly) on inexpensive glossy magazine stock. The contents are all handwritten (presumably by del Toro) and are nearly illegible at the size they are printed. The forward of this 4-page journal reveals the true intention of this \\"extra\\".<br />  \\"The color palette and further designs are available in 'The Art of Hellboy II' book and they illuminate this quest in a much more complete way.\\"<br /><br />So much for the \\"Exclusive Production Journal\\" promised on the packaging. While there's nothing technically wrong with it, it's NOT a collector's item and hardly worth the paper on which it is printed. What a disappointment.<br /><br />MINI-POSTER<br />WARNING: Fanboy rant ahead.<br />OMFG!<br />The \\"Mini-poster\\" is actually STAPLED and FOLDED into the \\"journal\\". Now I didn't expect much from anything called a \\"mini-poster\\", but you'd think they could have found a way to avoid staples! Why not just go all the way and SPINDLE and MUTILATE the thing? Jeez!<br /><br />GOLDEN ARMY SOLDIER FIGURINE<br />Ok. So this is the big one. You'd expect something approaching the quality of other collector's set items. I'm not talking full-on McFarlane quality here. More like the BatCycle that shipped with the recent Batman release.

I tried this several times, to no avail.<br /><br />RIGHT ARM<br />After failing once with the left arm, I thought maybe I'd gotten the wrong side (even though I'd put the arms on the same sides as they were packed. Before swapping them, I tried the RIGHT arm in the RIGHT shoulder hole. As I pushed the pin into the hole I felt a slight click. I thought that was a good sign so I let go.

030738683X|4.0|Catherine Morland has nothing to recommend her as a bride.  She is somewhat pretty in a tomboyish kind of way, but she is far from rich.  She is also not particularly accomplished.  She is passionate about gothic novels, but that is hardly a quality men seek.  What is a girl of marriageable age to do?  To Catherine's delight, she travels to Bath, where she meets the charming Mr. Tinley, who invites her to meet his family at his estate called Northanger Abbey.  Catherine loves the house's dark and mysterious appearance.  Her imagination gets the best of her, and soon she begins to experience things not unlike the stuff she reads about in The Mysteries of Udolpho.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from Jane Austen's \\"dud.\\"  This was published last, though it wasn't the last novel Austen penned (I believe Persuasion was her final completed work).  I had read all of her books except for this one, for everyone told me it wasn't that great.  Well, even though this isn't the best Austen novel, it is not terrible either.  It exceeded my expectations in more ways than one.  Austen's keen eye for satire can be appreciated more here than in any of her other novels.  She let us know what she felt about the gothic genre, not in a derogatory manner, but with sharp humor and interesting characters.  Catherine is an engaging heroine, though irritating at times, and Mr. Tinley is so charming that I couldn't help falling for him.  There are no surprises in the story, but that did not take away from my enjoyment.  As a lover of gothic novels and a fan of the likes of Ann Radcliffe, Charlotte Bronte and Daphne du Maurier, I was able to laugh at Austen's antics.  I definitely recommend this novel if you haven't read it.  If you're new to Jane Austen, then I advise you to read this one first, that way you won't be disappointed with it after reading the others.  But if you hate this book, move on to the other books, for you might feel differently about the others.

B001JNNE64|3.0|Amadeus has been one of my favorite movies since first I saw it,so I was very excited to hear of the added 20 minutes of footage in the \\"Directors cut\\" Blu-ray edition. More Amadeus...What could be better? The original, that's what.   For the first time I realized how much good editing can contribute to a film. I found that the added scenes did nothing to improve the movie and in some instances even diminished it in some way. Although I generally approve of the addition of breasts to any film (not because they make a better film, I just like em') even this scene I feel was best left out.    All in all, \\"Amadeus\\" with or without the added scenes, is in my opinion, one of the great films of all time.   Watch it and enjoy!

The main characters are a boy and young female vampire.  There is also a serial killer.  If your the type that wants a movie where someone gets stabbed or killed every 30 seconds this isn't for you.  If you like more suspense in your horror and something very well done this is your movie.  I really liked the last few minutes of the movie!
B001TODCII|3.0|This movie was incredibly unoriginal and very typical. I could have seen the outcome a mile away. It is so unoriginal that you could have predicted the outcome if you know your film qualities. People that gave this 5 stars must be those that are easily satisfied. Nowadays, you can't just judge the quality of the film just based on directing and acting, but also how unique their ideas are.    Why make a film that has been made dozens if not hundreds of times over? Don't encourage filming of this kind, they need to be more original. I'm hard to please, but at least you're hearing it from someone that has some idea of what he's talking about.    This is still my opinion and to be honest, I would give this film a 3.5 almost 4 because it is slightly entertaining. It has your typical fighting action, those found in Steven Seagal movies.     Watch me sum it up in a few short sentences, this is when you know the movie's plot is actually really lame. Ex-CIA predicts something bad will happen and the other person that he warns it to still does it, then they get in trouble, then he tells the bad guys he's going to catch them, then he goes and catches them.    YES! Don't believe me? Watch it. It is still a decent watch and it entertained me, but expect nothing original.    Stop giving it 5 stars, that's why 5 star movies among numerous other things on amazon are not taken seriously. People are sometimes paid to give movies 5 stars or some people are just simply way too easy to satisfy. I've never written my reviews to have people agree with me, just a thought that maybe it'll make you think a bit harder next time when you see glowing reviews about something.

B0000640VN|4.0|Lest you hold that old-fashioned romance is dead and gone, here comes a quality movie to flick your earlobe reprovingly and to gainsay that belief. 2001's KATE & LEOPOLD stars Hugh Jackman at his elegant, charming best and Meg Ryan, appealing as ever and very much in her wheelhouse. And while not quite as classic as Meg's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE or WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... this torn-out-of-time, fish-out-of-water romantic comedy sparkles with humor, appealing characters, and, yup, romance.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman plays the robust fictional Leopold, third duke of Albany (as opposed to the sickly real-life Leopold, duke of Albany). In Jackman's hands Leopold isn't some fancy pants twit but rather a suave, well-mannered and stand-up guy. It's April 28, 1876 and Leopold has brought his destitute but noble pedigree to New York, his uncle insisting that he find some rich American heiress to marry. We learn early on that Leo is not only an engineering inventor of sorts but that he's also discontented with his royal lot in life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in modern-day New York, Kate (Meg Ryan) on the surface is a successful career woman, doing big things in market research. But her personal life is a mess, Kate having just a month ago broken up with her longtime boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schreiber), a scientific louse obsessed solely with time portals. And who happens to be the great-great grandson of Leopold the third duke of Albany. Past and present get Kevin Baconed when Stuart discovers and uses a time portal to the past, just off the Brooklyn Bridge, and returns with an ancestral passenger accidentally in tow.<br /><br />Kate and Leopold meet, and it's not pretty, what with the jaded, heartbroken Kate finding Leo in her ex-boyfriend's crib. Then there's how Leo is dressed like Sergeant Pepper. But this is Meg Ryan, whose mutant power is to embody the wistful, starry-eyed heroine in these things, so slowly Leo begins to have an effect. To ratchet the suspense, elevators all over the city begin to malfunction, this being a side effect of Leopold not being in his own time. It makes sense once you realize that in his rightful era, Leopold - who, remember, is an engineer - would go on to invent the lift. And if Leo were not to return to his rightful era, well, cue in the scary repercussions...<br /><br />Hugh Jackman owns this movie even more so than Meg Ryan. Those who've seen him take on the grim superhero part (snikt!) in the X-Men films may be surprised that Hugh can also play a convincing cultured Englishman. He demonstrates this saving grace, a self-deprecating quality, which keeps him from venturing into snobbyland. So you end up liking him even as he imparts lessons in gentlemanly refinement and etiquette to various contemporary New Yorkers. Hugh's romancing of Meg is fun to watch and the most key element in the film, but, let's face it, the love story is a foregone conclusion. So, really, it's Hugh's reactions to his shocking new environs which particularly caught my interest. Would that we all were as graceful under similarly unfamiliar straits (although, yeah, his royal dudeness does lose it a bit when confounded by the enigmatic toaster).<br /><br />It's fun watching Leopold interacting with New York's fast-lane living denizens. It's a given that the ladies would be bowled over by his charm and couth and accent. But I was surprised at how well Jackman works with Breckin Meyer, who plays Kate's aimless younger brother. It isn't too long before Breckin's character is looking up to Leo and taking his advice in behavior and in how to woo a chick. Breckin also just gave me a mantra for dealing with stubborn bottles of certain condiments: \\"You shake and shake the ketchup bottle; none will come, and then a lot'll.\\"<br /><br />Casting aside the trappings of time travel, KATE & LEOPOLD is a throwback, wafting in that whiff of old-fashioned romance. It's just as well that the time portal angle isn't dwelled on for much of the movie (other thanin the running Stuart sub-plot), as it probably would've just muddied up the waters. As it is, we get to take in wonderful performances by Meg Ryan, being her sweet self, and Hugh Jackman, terrific as a nobleman out of his time but not out of his element. Hugh's Leopold reminds us that, even in the face of swines and cynicism, there's yet a place for good manners. And that also, back in the day, operas weren't just for sissies.in the running Stuart sub-plot), as it probably would've just muddied up the waters.

0061537934|4.0|This book, told from an unusual point of view, is a fun read.  It is not great literature.  Some of the situations, and espeically the ending, are a little predictable and even more unrealistic.  Some of the racing references might be lost on non-racers, but with little negative impact.  Good entertainment.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Steve Wilson is the first musician alive that successfully and brilliantly brought back the atmospheres of sound originally projected and conceived by Pink Floyd into his own style. There is alot to be said about this achievment.  Others have mimicked but fallen short, and there really has never been another band that could really do what Pink Floyd did. There are a lot of dark and scary sounds and mentally projected hallucinations that seemed to come clearer upon repeated listens. And not only did Steve Wilson acheive this major feat, but he also excellently executes alot of the ground achieved by the latter day King Crimson as well. Of course there are also moments of Porcupine Tree (his own band of brilliance) and some of his other projects that have formed \\"Insurgentes\\" into a real and true work of art. Steve has learned from all the masters and he has now become one of them. He has, over the last ten years, become one of the most important musicians of  our time.
B0012GN0Z8|5.0|This version of Chimes Of Freedom, is by far the best version that I have ever heard. The Boss sends chills down your spine with this one.  Bob Dylan should be honored....  The Boss sure lives up to his name on this EP. excellent job on all tracks.....
B0000C23DO|5.0|This Grateful Dead compilation covers no less than twenty years of their recording career from their debut of 1967 till the fine 1987 album \\"In the Dark\\". In spite of the great span of time the CD comes out quite consitent featuring the majority of the band's best known songs.<br /><br />Their 1970 album \\"American Beauty\\" is one of their really great albums and it's no surprise that this album is the best represnted here with no less than 5 songs. Another fine 1970 album was \\"Working Man's Death\\" which had the fine \\"Uncle John's Band\\" and \\"Casey Jones'\\".<br /><br />Grateful Dead were always known as a great live-act and one 1972 live-recording is included here, but though \\"One More Saturday Night\\" is by no means a weak track, I would have preferred to see one or two more of their studio-recordings instead.<br /><br />At any rate this compilation should work as an appetizer for more music from one of the finest American West Coast bands to come out of the 1960's.
0930289234|5.0|I don't know where to start,<br /> ok, so lets just make this easy for everyone, book is alot better than the movie. movie was great dont get me wrong, sadly there is a difference in the endings. both give off the same message though, so i guess that aint too bad. i actually saw he movie before reading the book. after having and entire day to myself reading page by page, i fell in love with this. ya sure im 17 so but this novel was not intended for young readers.<br /><br />  JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THIS BOOK!!!

B001O7JHJ8|5.0|Erasure.  Total Pop! - The First 40 Hits.<br />© 2009 Mute Records Limited.  Printed in the E.U.  LC05834.  CDMUTEL16.  5 099924 294720.<br />Released 23 February 2009 (U.K.)<br /><br />Total Pop! is also available as Deluxe Box (3 CD/1 DVD).<br /><br />First of all, I must admit that I'm not really a big Erasure fan.  I would call myself a casual fan who has enjoyed a number of the duo's singles over the years, starting really with 1994's \\"Always\\", which has become my favorite Erasure song.  Nonetheless, I must admit that I was extremely excited when I first viewed the press release for this 2009 double-disc hits compilation.  Does it get any better than this?<br /><br />Glancing over the tracklisting it is really an amazing overview of this synth-pop duo of Andy Bell and Vince Clarke, an act which I think has been overlooked many times despite continuously churning out numerous high quality singles year after year, album after album.  I don't think that many people realize just how many hits that these guys have had since hitting the music scene in 1985.  Add them up!  Yep, 40!  (... and counting!)  Astonishing!  Not many bands or artists have that kind of track record!<br /><br />A whopping 33 of these hits made the U.K. Top 40 while 28 of them made the U.K. Top 20. Quite an impressive feat!  Take a look at the hits.  While most of these singles did not chart in the U.S. they were successful overseas.  If you are a U.S. music lover and unfamiliar with their hits outside the U.S. charts now is your chance to catch up!<br /><br />As I listen to this 2-CD collection starting with 1985's \\"Who Needs Love (Like That)\\" on disc 1 and ending with \\"Always [Jeremy Wheatley 2009 Mix]\\" on disc 2 I'm reminded of the numerous gems that I may have overlooked initially -- for example, hits such as \\"Blue Savannah\\" (1990) and \\"In My Arms\\" (1997).  The latter track I vaguely recall hearing for a brief time on the radio the summer of '97 and had completely forgotten how amazing it sounds!  Even recent singles such as \\"Here I Go Impossible Again\\" (2005) and \\"I Could Fall In Love With You\\" (2007) are as good as the early cuts, in my opinion.<br /><br />The 2009 mix of \\"Always\\", which has been used to promote this release, is not radically different from the original 1994 album version.  Perhaps that's why I like it?  Coming roughly 15 years after the original release \\"Always\\" still sounds as amazing as the first time that I heard it.<br /><br />One may note the big push to emphasize the digitally remastered sound with this collection.  Notice the \\"2009 digital remaster\\" tag on nearly every track in the above listing.  A little overboard, eh?  I'm glad that the audio is getting recognition when it often does not!  All tracks have been newly remastered for this 2-CD set by Simon Heyworth at Super Audio Mastering, Devon.  And what a difference it makes!  Many of these tracks have never sounded better, with the exception of the excellent mastering on [[ASIN:B0000DD53E Hits: The Very Best of Erasure]] from 2003.<br /><br />The liner notes are rather thin but informative, nonetheless.  Erasure's hits are broken down across a few pages in terms of writers, production, mixes, EP/single information, release dates, and U.K. peak chart positions.  Many casual fans may find this information very useful if discovering the duo for the first time.  Additionally, the packaging is very nicely done, in my opinion, with the two lovebirds on the back of the album sleeve topping it off.  Beautiful!<br /><br />Note that while the collection is titled as having the first 40 hits of Erasure it is actually 41 tracks (with the new mix of \\"Always\\") in chronological order.  Disc One fills in at roughly 78 minutes, and Disc Two covers roughly 77 minutes.  No space is wasted, cramming this package full of excellent, timeless pop music.  Here's to the next 40!e I Go Impossible Again\\" (2005) and \\"I Could Fall In Love With You\\" (2007) are as good as the early cuts, in my opinion.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|i have yet to find a gamepad similar to this one for a lefty.  i would be willing to pay quite a bit for something like this, yet the minority is ignored and we dont get a game pad.  much anger. much anger.  **** EDIT    i went ahead and bought this gamepad. while i was disapointed on missing out on the thumbstick, i still love the usability of the G13.   3 different macros per game, or program. Brilliant!  i mainly use it for programing, now instead of typing long scripts, i just press a single button.   i love it, and i wish it was for left handed people, or at least could be moddable to go both ways. but it works for me.  money well spent. i would buy it again.
032147404X|2.0|I read all the great reviews on this book - so I eagerly anticpated reading it! I was put off initially by the authors humor (tack sharp?) - but got past that looking for tips on exposure - flash photography, etc. and while I saw a few of these scattered in and amongst the pages - it just was not enough! There was lots of 'gloss' but not enough detail for my needs. I have many years of film and digital photography experience - so perhaps this book is more designed for the beginning photographer that does not understand tripods and their use among other basic tips.
B0012GMZKE|4.0|I have had Cohens first three albums for several years and enjoy them profusely. The small stories he tells range from desolation, sardonic views of the world, to drunken hysteria. The album title shows that a lot of the songs are about love and this is true. This collection is not the strongest prose of Cohens but there are some very poppy and uplifting songs.
B001AT4Y84|4.0|\\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" is a solid sequel to [[ASIN:B00005N5S5 The Terminator (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00008PC2O Terminator 2 - Judgment Day (Extreme DVD)]], but it's story line and casting are a little weaker this time.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me. This time SkyNet is targeting the John Conner in his 20s, and once again two Terminators are sent back in time; one to \\"terminate\\" and one to protect.<br /><br />There are a lot of technical issues with this movie (i.e. only living flesh can be sent back, remote control of cars and trucks the were not made for it, etc). The casting of John's love interest was an interesting choice, since she looks much older and more mature than he does and they should be the same age.<br /><br />The new \\"Terminatrix\\" is very cool and totally scary! Arnold also puts in a strong performance and still looks cools as the \\"obsolete\\" model.<br /><br />The Special Effects are very good and likely the best of the lot.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable movie with a little suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the franchise.<br /><br />CFH
B001F12J0C|5.0|I love the Bourne series and this DVD set is awesome. The movies are great and it is like watching them in the theater all over again every time I put them in. They just suck you into the story and all that action! I also love how this set are packaged. It is really compact and makes storing 3 movies very easy.

1932100660|5.0|The China Study would be a great text for all high school and college students.  It is the definitive study of diet and nutrition on cancer, as well as the major diseases that plague our industrialized nations.  The answer is \\"simple\\" (just eat plants), but tough to learn a whole new way of eating.  However, the prize (good health) is worth it.  My brother is currently dying of cancer, despite the best efforts of traditional medicine.  My son's girlfriend is also using traditional therapies to treat her cancer.  The rate of cancer is soaring.  This book is the first to give real answers, based on 40 years of research with the largest population sample ever taken in the world.  The results are conclusive. After reading this book, my whole family is learning a new way to eat...  and we actually like it!
0440236738|5.0|This novel was soooo good that I finished it in one setting and it is now on my list of top ten thrillers along with books by authors, John J. Nance, Greg Iles, Dennis Lehane and Tom Clancy.<br /><br />Not only is Coben a masterful story teller but he can paint his characters with realistic details and make them come to life with dialog that is real. I felt like I knew his characters and cared how they felt and what may happened to them; ever one seemed to be in danger at some point in this twisting tale of surprises. Not only was it a suspenseful and exciting read but the ending was more shocking and surprising than any book that I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Will, the director of a shelter for run-aways, has buried his mom that died of cancer .  He is now pondering both his life and those of his family and friends. Ken, his older brother, was accused of brutally murdering a neighbor that was Will's first true love eleven years ago - Will had never believed he was guilty and believed him dead - rumors said he had fled to Europe - his mom had whispered to Will several days before her death that Ken, who Will worshiped as a hero, was alive - the neighbors, still bitter, did not attend  his mom's funeral.<br /><br />And now Sheila his second love for the last year had left a cryptic note in the kitchen and vanished. The plot takes off from here and the more Will finds out makes him realizes he didn't know Ken or Sheila at all.<br /><br />Author al-Qaeda Strikes Again
006117758X|5.0|Bukowski is as graphic as ever in his way of life.  I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  He has shown the world how it really is without hiding behind huge metaphors which a lot of writers persist in doing.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|With Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio in a Ridley Scott movie I expected that it would be good and it didn't disappoint.  I thought it went beyond the usual spy movies and got deeper into the actual day-to-day workings of how the field agent worked with Washington and got tied in with local players.      I have no idea if the 24/7 phone and GPS contact, the set ups, only looking to the goal with no regard for who gets hurt along the way, etc.,  are realistic to how things work, but it all seemed plausible.      Even when I had already pretty much figured out how this was going to end, I still didn't know how the story would get there.  The writing, acting and direction created characters that were multi-dimensional and as a view I wanted to know what was going to happen to them every step of the way.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|This documentary film is not just about a crazy man walking on a wire high up in the sky. It is a valuable lesson about what an intelligent, courageous, disciplined hard and smart  work with a purpose can achieve. This is the answer to the criticism that walking on a high wire has no benefit to the welfare of society. The benefit to society is to teach a lesson about the potential capability of the human being in a society where too many people think they are inadequate and live life without setting any goals. This is the same lesson given by the achievements of climbers of the Everest summit.    In the film you can see how  Phillipe Petit dreamed, planned and achieved his goal to walk between the twin towers in New York in 1974, that were subsequently brought down on September 11th 2001 by terrorist plane crashes. He set this goal even before the twin towers' construction began. He walked on the wire on lower heights for many years such as on the Sydney Harbor Bridge and many other places in the world for many years before eventually walking on the wire between the twin towers of New York. He had a supporting team of friends who tried to talk him out of the twin towers project fearing that he would fall. Despite this he kept his persistence. In the film we see that the team put up the wire between the twin towers after midnight so that they would not get caught. Even setting up that wire was very difficult. When dawn broke they had slept very little, even the walker Phillipe Petit. His friends were anxious that without a good night sleep and rest he would be too exhausted to keep his balance on the wire and made a last attempt to persuade him to give up the idea. He did not change his mind. It is remarkable that he spent 45 minutes on the wire, going back and forth between the towers 8 times as the crowd below and the police that came onto the towers to arrest him watched him. He didn't just walk ; he lyed on the wire like on a bed, balanced on his knee etc. When he came off the wire he was arrested and taken to psychiatric examination for insanity. He was found to be perfectly sane and charges against him of trespassing etc. were dismissed.    The only downside to the film is that a few of the scenes have low picture quality and some of the interviews made by the walker and members of the team are sometimes a little boring. However, some viewers of the film may not find the interviews boring.
0676978010|5.0|There have been so many excellent reviews of Naomi Klein's thesis and the wonderfully written book to support it that I can add no more to that aspect of review.  Suffice it to say that her work may turn out to be one of the most significant works on economic and political realities to have been published in the last 100 years.  The \\"Evil Empire\\" that Ronald Reagan alluded to, however, as she suggests was not anymore evil than the one he was the purported leader of.      Both Russia and the USA became mired in ideology during the last 100 years.  Ideologies in and of themselves turn out to be dangerous when clung to in the face of all of the calamities that they inspire.  Belief in a Christian myth, for instance, inspires belief in a God as well as a Devil.  So one who is a believer may perform compassionate acts on the one hand when listening to their imaginary friend in the sky as well as they might drown their five children when they hear the voice of Beelzebub from below in his fiery homeland.      Klein's book establishes that Amerika's encroaching theory of Utopia is just as hateful and full of blood as the perfection sought in hard core Marxist doctrine.  Capitalism must be restrained and modified in the same way that Marxism must be to create a workable and just society.  Claims to the contrary ignore the established facts of history which she defines so well.
1416511946|5.0|This book was an amazing piece of work and I DO NOT agree with all the stupid people who think that Nikki was bragging or whining the entire time. I think it was a masterpiece that helped you get into the mind set that he was in at the time and the close calls and then finally the ending which we all know how turned out. If anything this book is a big eye opener to how bad someone can have it while living his lifestyle. So in a way this whole book is one big \\"Say No To Drugs\\" brochure. Excellent book!
B00006CXSS|5.0|The story of Easy Company is one of the best ever told. You actually bond and get to know the main characters very well, and can't help but be filled with admiration. It is also great to see the real soldiers from Easy company being intervied and listen to the story from their own lips. It should be a must study in high schools today.  Americans should be very proud of who they are, what they have done for other countries. This is a clear example of how they gave everything they had to offer without expecting wealth, fame or recognition all to restore freedom and liberate Europe from terror. I recommend not only to watch the series but also read the book.

Shout Factory<br /><br />Steve Hoffman Forum member, Zal Schreiber, mastered the first release in the USA for Atlantic and it sounds very good. The Hammond organ and vocals appear to be captured without the slight peak in the midrange that is present in the Victory (Joseph Palmaccio mastering) - this shows as some Hammond organ notes that jump out a bit too much compared with the Atlantic mastering. There is a bit of sibilance in the original recording, and the Atlantic emphasizes it least. The Mobile Fidelity either (a) allows all the recorded bass through or (b) boosts it a bit. My personal opinion is they let it shine without equalisation, as the bass seems to be without any peaky emphasis - that however is merely a guess. The upper midrange/lower treble (high hat in particular) is much brighter than it should be in the Mobile Fidelity (unknown mastering engineer) and the Rhino (mastered by Joseph Palmaccio for Victory and reissued by Rhino) compared with the Atlantic and is a bit tiresome at higher volume levels because of this. I like the Atlantic despite its probable higher generation source.<br />As for the Shout Factory Tarkus - it's not a great experience. There is lots of added distortion during the title track starting at 3:01 (and heralded by some crackling noises) in the right channel. This is NOT present in any of the versions I have heard (including UK Island and Kinney/WEA (Manticore) vinyl) and I don't think this one is going to last long in the collection. The title track is not indexed, unlike all the other editions, which makes it difficult to access parts of the title track immediately! The Atlantic, IMHO, sounds the best, and both the Palmaccio (Victory and Rhino) and MFSL are far better than the Shout Factory.<br />The CD booklet is most spectacular in the Mobile Fidelity, although the quality of the reproduction is a little less than in perfect focus and a bit too dark. The Victory/Rhino has the inside and outside of the gatefold in full colour and sharp focus, whereas the Atlantic has the outside of the original gatefold in colour and the inside in black and white, but in the highest resolution of all of them. Full marks to the Victory/Rhino for the resolution of the cover and its full reproduction. The Shout Factory has a low resolution reproduction of the original cover, even compared with the MoFi.

B000066AXE|2.0|In reading another reviews I'm afraid to let my opinion but I think isn't so important and truth is.  I only know mathematician John Nash owing to this film and something else I have read after showing it. I think he's truly a superb scientist, supported by the incomparable opportunities the USA universities offer to these people over- dowered.  But for me this movie has two central failures; these are, the hallucinations are presented in a form too solid and coarse, so, the viewer also believes the FBI agent and the student of Literature,, mate of Nash at the University are real. This trick, of course, surprises later the spectator, but I think hallucinations from schizophrenia are more subtle, untouchable things than these sturdy ghosts.   In other side, it seems Nash, being aware he suffers a terrible disease, uses his powerful mind to fight against the schizophrenia, so, he orders his hallucinations to retire and vanish. I think this is also unbelievable. Such unfortunate patients simply can't do anything in that way. I at less think so: volition and will are powerful weapons, but we humans are limited and is convenient to know when an effort is reasonable although difficult, and what is simply impossible, although at last, yes, who can say until when the will and love are operative?.  This is because the formidable mind of John Nash is very strong in dealing with abstract questions, surely he's one of that persons with a very high intelligence quotient, but mental illness are I think mostly a problem with deep roots in another class of intelligence not measurable with the  IQ. Unfortunately, there, Nash is weaker.  People as him have an asymmetrical mind. Today perhaps these is called today emotional intelligence, tomorrow we don't know, that doesn't matter here. Human beings have several classes of \\"brains\\" inside. A bad coordination of these complex mental machinery can drive to these illness.       Perhaps the physical strong Russel Crowe is neither the ideal protagonist for this personage but that isn't so important. As it were, I wish the best for people as John Nash....Not all persons are capable to win a Nobel prize still with a good health.
B000053VAF|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was about when I picked it up at the rental. Firstly, you gotta watch this movie with an open mind. What's it about? It's about God, angels, prophets and the likes and it all takes place in the modern day. It actually makes fun of them, but in a good way. This is a very funny, clever and insightful movie with great dialogues and good acting. The characters are funny but real. I don't think I have seen any other movie that's so outrageously funny and thoughtful at the same time. I look forward to watching the other movies by director Kevin Smith.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|It's been a long time since I had to end a movie in less than a 1/2 hour of watching it.  In this case, I'm not sure if it even made it to 15 mins. The beginning scenes were so scattered that it was difficult to get a feel for the movie.  Then, is it supposed to be a drama, comedy, anyones guess. Appeared to be \\"Gone with the Wind\\" meets \\"Road Warrior\\". Awful!!

B001PPLIEQ|3.0|When did James Bond become Jason Bourne?  Please don't tell me that this Bond is the closest thing to Ian Fleming's Bond--that means you haven't read the books.  This series has a tremendous identity crisis.  I thought that the reason for the release of Brosnan and the hiring of Craig was to \\"start over\\" and return to the roots of the series.  When's that happening?  This film was loud, kinetic, frenetic, and quite pathetic.  This wasn't a Bond movie--it was \\"The Bond Identity (Crisis).\\"  Oh, yeah, but I will still buy it on DVD.  It's no worse than View to a Kill.
B00005JPY2|3.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />Unlike many reviewers of this film, I was not well-acquainted with the graphic novel on which this film was based before the motion picture adaptation came along.  I learned about the whole thing after seeing a preview for this film in 2008 and reading a bit about the story.  Thus, by the time I saw this in the theater, I was aware of the basic plot but not all that much more.  Despite a lot of mixed reviews, I decided to give this film a chance and was relatively pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Given that my expectations were fairly low (based on said film reviews), I have to say I enjoyed the film more than I expected I would. Specifically, I appreciated the somewhat more cerebral approach to a genre that often lacks in this area.  This film stood the entire superhero genre on its head, asking the viewer to consider what would happen if the archetypes were placed in somewhat more realistic situations and their belief systems or code of conduct were pushed to their logical extreme.  This alone is enough to merit 3.5 stars, and if it fails a bit by the end of the film it is still oftentimes convincing.  The characters were also very interesting and I enjoyed learning their individual backstories, which fleshed them out and made them seem like real people (even though one is blue and can do nearly anything imaginable due to a cliche freak-science-experiment-gone-wrong).  It was ultimately a very reflective film, and at moments very thought-provoking.  My favorite scene was the one in which Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II decide to go out and be heroes again rather than remianing in retirement.  It's touching and shows how much the charaters' real identiies are wrapped up in or shaped by their assumed ones.  In other words, where does the individual end and the mask begin?  The film asked that question again and again, but didn't offer easy answers.<br /><br />However, this film was by no means a five-star experience.  The gore (which many people mentioned to me before I saw the film) was jarring at times and actually served as un unappealing distraction from the story.  I understand the director's desire to be edgy in keeping with the nature of the graphic novel, but the director's decisions have to serve the overall message of the film and in my opinion this did not.  I also did not enjoy how the villain explains everything at the end, which is cliche to the point that it is just irritating.  However I can see why he did so, since the plot was at times convoluted.  It was also a very long film, which didn't give the characters all that much to do for stretches of time.<br /><br />So overall worth a watch, but flawed enough not to merit 5 stars.I saw the film) was jarring at times and actually served as un unappealing distraction from the story.

B000VWE5OY|2.0|Torchwood was supposed to be the \\"adult\\" spin off of `Doctor Who' but apart from a few splatter of blood and gratuitous sex scenes (no nudity), it would have insulted the intelligence of a normal 10 year-old.    It seems as if the talented writer and producer Russell T Davies has taken the best ingredients from other shows and movies and combined them into Welsh's omelets.    We have a team of \\"specialists\\" investigating unexplained mysteries (this reminds me of Buffy, Angel, the X-Files, Fringe and even Scooby Do) Torchwood even has a black van/SUV that they travel around in. Torchwood has a charismatic leader just like CSIs. They're a top secret government agency (\\"We're separate from your Government, outside the police, beyond the United Nations,\\" says team leader Captain Jack Harkness) and chase aliens (like the \\"Men in Black\\" - they even have a way of wiping people's memories).     The Torchwood team even has a row of prison cells identical to those in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". However, probably due to the show low budget, the cells' Perspex windows are very thin and it keeps making me wonder why the dangerous aliens in the end cell couldn't escape from their flimsy cells. The Torchwood team also has a pet pterodactyl nesting in the roof yet the place isn't littered with pterodactyl wastes or whose job it is to clean it up. The Torchwood team also let pterodactyl out to fly around Cardiff where for some miraculous reasons the thing went unnoticed by the general population.    Imagine am omelets made from the best filet mignon, a spoon of caviar, a splash of Old Spiced, a grated David Bowey CD and one of Tom Brady dirty socks, would you eat such an omelets? It's all the more depressing since this comes from the talented Russell T Davies.  I watch many Sci-fi shows from Doctor Who to the new Battlestar Galactica and Fringe and the different between those shows and Torchwood is that the scripts from other shows work hard to create a plausible reality unlike Torchwood.    Accept for the character Captain Jack, the rest of the Torchwood team themselves is made up of stupid, ignorant, arrogant, selfish, unprofessional dolts who readily sacrifice the lives of innocent people and other team members for their own benefit. Gwen, the ex-policewoman new recruit and one of the main characters of the show have a dopey lived in boyfriend who does something boring. She professed to love him and promptly shag one of her male co-worker. Yet when the stupid boyfriend learns of his girlfriend betrayal, he quickly forgives her and continued to live with her.     In \\"Doctor Who\\", Captain Jack was the charismatic, flirtatious, try-sexual secret agent from the future who tries to have sex with male, female, she males (I'm not sure if your pets and farm animals is safe from the Captain). Yet in Torchwood he became a one dimensional character who dated his male subordinates, mopes about the place like a lovesick schoolgirl, his whole appeal stripped away. In another of the show's many visual non-sequiturs, Captain Jack stand on the tops of very tall buildings for no good reason, like Batman, broodingly staring into the distance. The many, many impressive aerial shots of the city that pad out the episodes must have cost lots of money but did nothing to enhance the plot.    Take the plot of the second episode, for example, which was lifted entirely from one of the episode of \\"Doctor Who\\". Except now the villain isn't an alien, trapped inside a television, that feeds on the electrical energy of the human brain, it's an alien trapped in the body of a jailbait teenage girl who shag people to death in order to absorb their `orgasmic energy'. Torchwood duly captures her and locks her up. Gwen goes down to the cells for a chat and, affected by the alluring pheromones the alien gives off to attract its prey, ends up in some hot lesbian action. The rest of the team just watches the whole thing on CCTV unconcerned that their colleague is playing \\"tongue hockey\\" with an alien parasite.    Torchwood season 1 is just plain awful, hopefully, season 2 and three will be much better and Russell T. Davies will make serious improvement on the characterization instead of beating the viewers on the head with his pro-Wales, pro-alternative lifestyle agenda. Torchwood is just entertainment, not a political broadcast. Keep it that way, Russell, and your message will get further.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|I watched the entire first season in one sitting and enjoyed it very much but felt the show could have benefitted from at least one scene illustrating the havoc that crystal meth can create in the lives of many of its abusers and Walter White's reaction to it. I mean, I can't recall any scene where White expresses one shred of regret for what he unleashes upon the world. And I couldn't stop thinking of the countless methamphetamine addicts White would help create after they took thier first hit of his purer-than-pure drug and chased it forever thereafter to thier utter ruin. White seems so decent and morally-driven that I doubt he wouldn't have considered this as well. A great show though overall. Bryan Cranston is a wonderful actor.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I came across this dvd on Amazon and bought it on a whim.  In the last five years, I've lost about 45 pounds and kept it off, but I needed to get toned.  I wasn't a saint as far as doing the workouts every day for 30 days, but even just doing it 3 to 5 days/week and eating healthy, I was amazed at how my body transformed.  I dropped the last 5 pounds I was looking for, decreased the saddlebags that I seem to have been born with and developed nice definition in my stomach, close to a little four pack.  It's awesome.  What I love about this workout is that you work SO hard in only 20 minutes.  You can do anything for 20 minutes right?  So there's no excuse.  I now incorporate this dvd into my workout regime, along with Jillian's newer dvds, which I highly recommend. However, if you can only purchase one workout, this is what you should spend your money on.  Well worth it, but be ready to work.  These work outs are no joke.  Workout 1 is fairly easy if you're at an intermediate fitness level (you'll sweat buckets the first time, but be used to it within the week).  Number 2 is my favorite.  Three is torture, but you know you're \\"making change happen.\\" Jillian's got this stuff down pat.
B001LZ0R42|5.0|This lovely little book is told in a series of letters  between an authoress, her friends, and the serendipidous connection among them and the residents in post-war Guernsey, which was occupied by the Germans during WW II.<br /><br />It is beautifully performed by an ensemble cast of English actors; a bit reminiscent of the BBC radio plays of years past.  It made me laugh and cry and touched my heart.<br /><br />Perhaps most of all, it reminded me of what joy there was in writing and receiving handwritten letters.  My mother-in-law (or mum-in-law) wrote the lovliest letters about everyday happenings, her friends and church and garden and they transported me straight to her side, even when we were separated by an ocean.  This book brought the same pleasure to me--and was a jolly good story to boot.
B001IARDJ2|5.0|\\"OK. Don't panic. It's only a VISA bill.\\" Rebecca Bloomwood has to remind herself of that every time she receives her bill. She has an addiction, an addiction to shopping. Becky always gets a thrill when holding new shopping bags; she can't help it, can she?    Successful Savings, employs Becky, but doesn't pay enough. Her flat mate refuses her checks to help pay for the rent, but checks are all her bank manager wants from this shopaholic. While avoiding the bank, Becky is also trying to find another job. Since she fears the bank, she makes up lies about why she can't pay off her debt. But whether she has \\"a fever or a broken leg,\\" she always makes her way to the shops to spend away.     While I was reading Confessions of a Shopaholic, I felt as though I were walking the London streets alongside Rebecca. It seems crazy to me that people would revolve their days around shopping, but there are some people in the same situation. I found it difficult putting Sophie Kinsella's hilarious novel down. I think that girls who enjoy holding new shopping bags would get the most out of the book. Will Becky be able to find something or someone that could replace her desire for shopping?

B001ILFUDC|5.0|I think this is the first cartoon that I saw at a movie theater many, many years ago and it's still just as good as I remember it.  Jiminy Cricket takes you through the story and the music which you've heard over and over again throughout the years, like, &#34;When You Wish Upon a Star&#34;.  You can get the movie with a limited edition bonus CD with 7 classics songs here:  [[ASIN:0788876988 Pinocchio (2-Disc 70th Anniversary Platinum Edition) with Bonus Music CD]]  It's wonderful to see and hear it again.  All the characters that you remember like Figaro the cat and Cleo the goldfish, along with Gepetto, Stromboli, The Blue Fairy are there.  And if you've forgotten the details of the story you can now watch it again in this digitally enhanced version.<br /><br />I bought this DVD for my two parrots because they like cartoons and kid's movies.  But truth be told, it's really for me too.  It's fun to watch this again and a nice addition to my (their) collection.
B001DPC52C|5.0|Last November in The Netherlands, I have started my journey into a new rock genre, as a lifetime rock's fan (a music's fan actually), I was interested in this genre with hard rock backgrounds with angelical female voices. This was born in Europe, in the northerly countries of Norwegian and neighbors, and people call them as gothic rock, doom rock, etc.  Following my way to know more about the genre, I have bought this cd/DVD.  An I have to say I was impressed from the first time I play in my card, when I watched it in TV was a knock out. The voice of Sharon Van Adel is amazing, is precious, and the hard background is unbelievable.  They made a huge production for this show, with the Metropole Orchestra and many others performances, invited singers, fireworks, and so for, THIS A VERY RECOMMEND PACKAGE TO BUY.  If you are hard rock fan and your are open mind, this is for you.
006085880X|3.0|I discovered Jodi Picoult when I was looking for a good summer beach read last year. I read \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and I was hooked. I then read \\"Handle With Care\\" and finally \\"The Pact.\\" \\"The Pact\\" kept my interest, but I was disappointed overall because some of the key characters were not fully developed. We never really knew Emily or why she felt as she did. The description of the two sets of parents and their interaction following the tragedy was skimpy. Also, an odd twist involving one of each of the set of parents didn't make much sense. You want to shake Chris and scream at him to use his head and do something to prevent what happened. For a kid who seemed to have so much promise and make such good grades, he showed such poor judgement when it came to Emily. There are just so many loose ends and unresolved questions with this book. It is thought-provoking, but more an example to kids of what not to do should they encounter a situation like Chris and Emily's. I'll still read Jodi Picoult, in fact I'm reading \\"19 Minutes\\" currently and enjoying it, but \\"The Pact\\" was a bit disappointing.

1423101464|5.0|I started this series because my son begged me to read the first book.  Since I love reading, it didn't seem too hard to \\"slum\\" for a bit and read what I considered a children's book.  Who knew that I would be tearing through the series, pushing aside a pile of books that I should have been reading, going so far as to sneak into my son's room to grab this book from his bed after he fell asleep so I could read it.  This whole series is fantastic, and this book was just as compelling and page turning as the other three.  Although we are a family of readers, it's hard to find a book that all of the readers (two are just learning to read) can really enjoy reading and discuss.  The other really neat side is that the series has brought up the subject of Greek myths and we've been having lots of fun learning about them as a family and talking about them.    A note, while this is a fantastic book and a fantastic series, there are some more serious subjects in the book that some families might not be totally comfortable with.  This isn't much of an issue with me, my son is young for the subject matter of the book (he's 7), but since we've both read it, we can discuss the different aspects he doesn't understand together, which I enjoy.      All in all, I can't say enough great things about it, and the whole family is chomping at the bit for the next part of the series to come out!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Even though she is so young, Taylor Swift displays surprising maturity with her music. She wrote or co-wrote the majority of songs, and most of them deal with \\"adult\\" subjects such as love and break-up.

B001R60ESE|2.0|I also watched this concert on PBS, and agree with other reviewers that the performances and production values are first rate. The problem is the incessant talking between performances. It breaks the continuity and ruins the show for me. The chatter should be at the end of the disc in the \\"special features\\" section. Just my opinion...
B001PPLIEG|3.0|Language, character development, master shots all go away with the wind in this Daniel Craig sequel to the wonderful first effort,\\"Casino Royale.\\" Not one character, good or evil, slows the hectic pace or frenetic camera work. It's one thing to employ true international thugs, but can they utter clear English, here, as if there really is a working script? Scowling, pissed-off, characters throughout do not make an enjoyable experience. Car chase, airplane chase (a DC-3 out-flying a high-performance turbo?);isolation cave;explosions,Bond wins. Calling Roger Moore...come in Roger. A grade-school effort by Mr. Forster who flunks Hitchcock or Terence Young 101. Looked throughout like it was shot by Michael Moore's baseball hat cam.

B00003CWPL|5.0|Much like orgasm, sleep is necessary, life-affirming, soul-enhancing and mysterious.<br /><br />Two things have led me to 'Eraserhead':<br />1] The recent death of Patrick McGoohan brought back into focus his obsessive cage motifs and dynamic rants against collectivism and conformity - and 2] a heavy cold: your humble scribe has been suffering from a brutal attack of catarrh. When lying down to sleep, the phlegm sticking to the back of my throat is making the same noise as Henry Spencer's horrific issue - Beechams just isn't the answer.<br /><br />McGoohan's removal is the most telling of the two events. Just as it looks like Lynch will never fully explain 'Eraserhead', so too the hidden substratas of 'the Prisoner' are probably now lost for ever. There are those of us with theories - which however passionately and indignantly we expound - can now never be proved.<br />Just as it should be.<br /><br />There isn't sufficient mystery in the world. Not nearly enough child-like wonder.<br />The pressure of life is a clanking, hissing reality. I have no fear at all of getting old but the thought of ever-increasing responsibility and reliance is breath-restrictingly worrying.<br /><br />The things that make me jump from sleep aren't terrors of mortality or disease, but mundane fears of phone-calls not made, a deadline missed, an enquiry unattended. Everyday nonsense - sorted in twenty minutes of light and consciousness - takes on twisting, uncomfortable apprehensiveness when the eyelids finally start to flutter.<br /><br />In Lynch-World horrors are deeply personal, not shared. 'Eraserhead' reminds of Derek Jarman, 'the Wicker Man', Hammer movies (Lynch has definitely seen 'Curse of the Werewolf'), Powell and Pressburger, Cocteau, Morrissey...<br />It's also the funniest film. Lynch exorcises his inner-demons by laughing at us, and by laughing with him, we laugh at the biggest joke of all...<br />(Imagine ladies, answering one of those 'lonely hearts' ads and Lynch turning up!  Pockets stuffed with cigarettes, 'the Undiscovered Wit of Noel Edmonds' in one hand, and a dvd of 'Attack of the Mushroom People' in the other!)<br /><br />'Eraserhead' - furtive and under-hand - is a case of tell the truth and shame the devil. It's not possible to harbour misgivings when the joke being played is such a good one.<br />Henry, by Jack 'Chaplin' Nance is enthralling. The 'Man in Planet's (obviously the viewer) death throes in the same white light that finally gives Henry the freedom he craves, only to have everything snatched away by 'heaven' is almost Ophulsian in its pathos and symbolism.<br /><br />The fact that there is no final escape is the political satire, but it's the presentation of 'normal' family life, or God-help-us, family life as Lynch sees it, that gives the comedy its snap and edge.<br /><br />Insane chickens splutter blood at the worst dinner party in the world, a shoot grows from a mound next to Henry's bed where an alarm clock should be, his unfettered lust for the woman across the hall (very probably a prostitute), his dour, angry partner who is even more consumed by the depressing inevitability of existence than he is...<br />The tears will roll down your cheeks.<br /><br />'Songs in the Key of Life' could easily be titled 'Songs From the Key of Dreams'.

But not just any Mr. Darcy, she is enchanted by Colin Firth's version of the BBC's adaption. (You know the one... and you know you love him too!) But Jane is not your typical Darcy fan. She is not content to just watch the dvd, drool a little, and then put it away. Jane is obsessed. Her constant failed relationships are proof of that. She compares every man she meets with her ideal man, aka Darcy.<br /><br />A concerned family member bequeths her the most amazing gift, an all expenses paid trip to England. But not just any old England...Regency England! That's right, she's sent to Pembrook Park, a unique resort where everyone dresses and acts as if they are living in one of her beloved Jane Austen novels. Handsome actors are paid to give guests the most realistic Austen experience possible, including romances! Jane has decided to use this most generous gift to finally get Darcy out of her system. If she can live out her fantasy one time, she can finally let go. She is plunged head first into Pride and Prejudice. Can she deal with all the rules of society? Can this modern girl adjust to their strict etiquette? More importantly, can she resist falling in love with Mr.Nobly, the very epitome of a real live Mr. Darcy? And just how scandolous would it be if she was caught chasing around that dashing gardner she's spotted on the grounds?

0307388921|4.0|How could you not like a book that starts out that way?<br /><br />Victor is a sex addict who attends sexual addiction groups to find new people to sleep with, chokes on food in restaurants so people will save him and feel indebted to him forever, works in Colonial America as a tour guide in the 1730's, and visits his mom in a mental hospital while pretending to be different people that she knew in the past. She has a secret, but won't tell him and since her diary is in Italian he can't read it.<br /><br />There are times when we flash back to when he's a child. Even though he is taken away from his mother, she keeps finding him and bringing him back. She sees the world differently, (to say the least) and gives him advice about living in the world that you don't get from books or school. Example: If the Blue Danube Waltz is played in hotel, that means that they are evacuating it. If they say \\"Elvis has left the building\\" in a Hard Rock Cafe, then that means the servers need to go and find out what dinner special has sold out. But, in a Broadway theater, that same line means that there is a fire.<br /><br />Like all Chuck Palahniuk's books, this one is different. There are tons of sexual descriptions, (and as many have mentioned, this is not a book for someone who gets offended easily, or is overly sensitive.) One of the most interesting chapters was when Victor met a woman who wanted him to break in her place and attack her, yet, he was doing it all wrong and she became very picky about it. Some other interesting tidbits were that Victor had all sorts of medical information since he's a medical school dropout, so you learn fun trivia like ABCD (Symptoms of Melanoma) Asymmetrical Shape, Border Irregularity, Color variation, and Diameter larger than about six millimeters. He once told a stripper who was taking off of her clothes in front of him that she needed to get her mole checked out on her inner thigh, because it might be cancerous. I was reminded of the book Survivor, because the character knew how to clean everything, such as, how to get blood off of walls.<br /><br />When you reach the climax, there are two big curveballs that were not expected.

B001IF252C|1.0|We purchased two of these adapters for our department and both have severe issues mentioned every where else online. Someone the adapter creates static on dark (black) area of the screen. I believe this is due to the conversion creating noise on black which should have nothing displayed. Also, on the dell monitor, a few times the screen would fuzz up probably due to dual-link adapter reverting to single link. The only fix is to remove the cable and reinsert it.     Apple support was of no help when I called. They referred me to the apple store. This issue is widespread. Apple claims the Cinema Display are working properly but I've tried it on two different monitors and both have issues.

B000002ARV|5.0|This is a great Johnny release, that features his slide playing and voice when they were still classic.  His song choices include a smoking version of the Rick Derringer song \\"Still Alive and Well\\", his own country honk on \\"Cheap Tequilla\\", and great versions of the Stones \\"Silver Train\\".  \\"It Ain't Nothing To Me\\" is another country influenced tune.  This includes a smoking version of the Dylan song, \\"From a Buick 6\\" which is a perfect choice for Johnny.  This is one of the better Johnny Winter studio releases.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Released in 1940, PINOCCHIO was the second full-length animated film to be released by Walt Disney Studios. Nearly a decade ago PINOCCHIO was also the first feature that Disney released on DVD. The movie is now be re-released again in this re-mastered Platinum Edition.<br /><br />The plot of the film is rather familiar. An older toy-maker named Gepetto makes a marionette that he names Pinocchio and upon the wishing star wishes that Pinocchio would come to life and be a real boy. The Blue Fairy hears Gepetto's wish and brings Pinocchio to life. However, he is told he can't be a real boy unless he proves himself to be good. The Blue Fairy makes a cricket named Jiminy Pinocchio's conscience to aid him in his journey to becoming good and a real boy. Pinocchio soon gets into one mess after another and eventually finds Gepetto again in the belly of the giant whale Monstro.  The adventure there illustrates to both the boy and his father what each is made of.<br /><br />Next to THE FOX AND THE HOUND, PINOCCHIO was my favorite Disney picture. Years later, it still remains a favorite. The film has some very dark and frightening images, e.g. the Coachmen revealing to Honest John and Gideon how the children who go to Pleasure Island never come back, Lampwick turning into a donkey, the chase from Monstro, etc. I remember being afraid of these images as a child and until I got to college always assumed the earlier Disney pictures were truer to their source material than their modern counterparts.  After first reading the original story, I discovered this really wasn't the case. Still, though the film isn't as dark as the original story, it retains much of the spirit and imagination of the original story.<br /><br />Besides that, the movie is a magnificent piece of filmmaking.  Even by today's standards the animation is impressive. Considering the film was made in the late 1930s and was released until 1940, the film is even more impressive.  For example, the water effects in the movie were the standard that all great animated picture attempted to emulate and wasn't surpassed until Pixar's 2007 RATATOUILLE.  And despite all the advances in animation, PINOCCHIO still remains as part of the canon that serious animation students study.<br /><br />The movie also has some great characters.  There's of course Pinocchio, his loving father Gepetto, The Blue Fairy, Jiminy Cricket, Figaro the cat, and Cleo theGoldfish, Stromboli, Honest John and his sidekick Gideon. Each of these characters is unique and though they appear somewhat cartoonish, they each have an individual personality that people can recognize and relate to.  They capture the imagination and allow for suspension of disbelief, inviting viewers into their vivid, yet harrowing world.<br /><br />Besides the story, animation, and characters, PINOCCHIO is also notable because of the music. PINOCCHIO was the first animated film to win an Oscar in a competitive category; PINOCCHIO picked up statues for both Best Original Score and Best Song. It was a feat that no Disney picture would repeat until the arrival of MARY POPPINS in 1964. Besides the awards, \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" became the anthem of the Disney empire. Dreams really can come true.<br /><br />Besides the beautifully re-mastered film, the Platinum Edition of PINOCCHIO includes a nice set of extras. The film is found on disc one along with an audio commentary, Pinocchio's Matter of Facts, Pinocchio Knows Trivia Challenge, a Disney Song Selection, and a music video of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" sung by one of the Disney Channel's latest teen sensations, Meghan Jette Martin.<br /><br />Disc two has the majority of the special features including two games, the \\"No Strings Attached: The Making of PINOCCHIO\\" featurette, deleted scenes, \\"The Sweatbox\\" featurette, live action reference footage, art galleries, trailers for PINOCCHIO from three different eras, the deleted song \\"Honest John\\", and the short documentary \\"Gepettos: Then and Now\\".  I especially liked the featurettes and the short documentary.  One of the games is a puzzle game that younger children might enjoy, but the other game, \\"Pleasure Island Carnival Games\\", is a game aimed at elementary kids that will only work on a DVD player. The featurettes are very informative, full of information that any serious Disney buff or film buff will enjoy.  For instance, I didn't even know what a sweatbox was before watching that featurette; now I know it's a room where animators and the director and producer meet to review unfinished clips of the film and how they can be improved. \\"Gepettos: Then and Now\\" showcases toymakers from around the world from a maker of classic wooden toys in England to a marionette maker in Prague to a robot maker in Japan.ocumentary.

B001LF4ARC|4.0|In short, this book was really inspiring, short and simple. I have to say it was interesting to be inside Steve's Brain and to get more understanding on the whole Apple as a company. For me, it was again nice to see and read that some ideas take tens of years to mature - like Apple's vision on do end to end their products.     Products by definition are usually seen as one unit, but modern business is more like handling end to end. In Apple and to Steve this means to managing business from iPod to iTunes to Customer.    Steve seems to be really big, charismatic and contreversial character, which makes him and Apple to be interesting as well.    I really enjoyed this experience, it was simple and easy. As are Apple's products

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was concerned a bit about the previous reviewer who stated that mating of each and every animal made these not suitable for family viewing. However, I have not found this to be the true theme in each movie. There are a few mating animals and strange mating dances and fighting, but they are spread out across the discs. My 4 year old son loves to watch these and learn the names of all the animals, finding out what they eat and where they live. David Attenborough is hardly narrating to his age group, yet he can't get enough of these. Very entertaining for our whole family. Highly recommended!

I am an avid reader, and movie collector and have been a little annoyed lately that nothing suprises me anymore.  I can always see what's coming next.  But the ending of this book had me shouting out loud.  I was so loud the echo came back and scared me!  I laughed, i cried, i could almost feel my heart break.  What a fantastic book!  The entire series is great!  I of course won't give away anything, but just trust me you need to get this book.  I finished it and logged right on to pre-order the fourth book that comes out in August.  I love the original story line, the characters, however different, were very easy to relate to, and this series was so well written i was lost in the book and thought i was there!  I absolutely recommend this book to anyone.  But i would recommend reading the series in order.  Wow, great series, i can't wait for the fourth one, hurry up please!!!  :)

B0002CHIJW|4.0|This one [along with Ms .45, which I believe was in part inspired by this film] was heavily discussed in the rape-revenge section of Carol Clover's Men, Women, and Chain Saws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film, to such a degree that it made its way to the front of my list. I had heard about it for years, but had trouble finding it. I DID keep finding I Will Dance On Your Grave, which seems like a cheap attempt to make money off of people who think it's this one. Their covers are also quite similar.<br /><br />The DVD opens with Jennifer Hill, our main character, leaving New York and taking a drive out into the country. She stops for gas, where we first see our rapists, and informs the station attendant that she is going to this country house she has bought that she has never seen. She gets to the house and walks around back, then decides to strip her clothes off and take a dip in the lake, without having unpacked or gone into the house at all. She gets a delivery of groceries from Matt, this semi-retarded guy who works at the local store, and he says he heard that \\"New York is an evil place.\\" Jennifer says \\"well, here's a tip from an evil new Yorker.\\" Matt then asks if they can be friends, Jennifer says they can. So, they're friends, and Matt seems a little pleasantly flummoxed to be friends with this woman. We have also found out that Jennifer has come out here for the summer to work on her novel, and that most of her published work so far has been in women's magazines. As a copywriter, I was thinking \\"Oh God, I hope we get to take a peek at her novel,\\" and we DO!<br /><br />So the guys are sitting around bored. One of them thinks about Jennifer and wonders \\"do beautiful women ever take a ****?\\" which cleverly sets up at least that character as seeing beautiful women as somehow not human. Then another of them chimes in that all the women in New York are whores, and that he's \\"going to go to New York and **** all the whores.\\" Another claims he's going to do the same in L.A. They then go out to Jennifer's house to harass her. She is writing outside while wearing a bikini, and the guys cruise by on a boat, then keep revving and cruising by in the lake, apparently oogling her body as she lays there. Then they come by her house and night and make whooping sounds outside. It's creepy, especially when you see that she hasn't locked the doors. What? Some New Yorker ISN'T going to keep all doors locked at all times?<br /><br />The next day while Jennifer is in a canoe, the guys come by and start dragging her canoe behind them in their speedboat. They drag her across the lake, then grab her and throw her to the ground. Matt, the semi-retarded one, has confessed to the guys that he thinks she's kind of a nice, so the supposed `reason' for the attack is to `get' her for Matt. When he won't do anything, another of the guys jumps on for a rape that is quite detailed and brutal. You will notice that there is no music during the rape [apparently there's no music in the entire film], which I thought was a good decision.<br /><br />They let her go and she runs off into the woods. The horror and shock are quite apparent on her face and in her body language as she stumbles naked through the woods. This is one of the clues that Ms .45 is a riff on this movie, because both of them seal the anti-rape point-of-view of the movie in showing in detail the horrible physical and psychic consequences. There is a chilling little surprise next for those who end up watching this movie, but as it would happen the guys haven't really let her escape and another of them brutally rapes her. We then have another completely harrowing scene as she makes it back to her cabin after a long, horrible walk through the woods.<br /><br />Turns out the guys are already waiting for her in the cabin. They persuade her \\"friend\\" Matt [who has not so much as raised is voice to defend her, by the way] to go ahead and rape her, and he attempts to, but \\"can't with you guys watching.\\" His attempt is filmed in a creepily close way that really evokes how unpleasant it would be for Jennifer. She, by the way, is laying exhausted, bloody and naked on the floor. At last the last of them, Stanley, gets on, but it seems that all he wants to do is beat her. Matt says to him \\"You wanted total submission, you got it!\\" And finally they all leave. The entire rape sequence has lasted 20 minutes.<br /><br />The guys force Matt to go back in and kill Jennifer. He can't stand to do it, so he just wipes the knife in the blood, and comes back to tell the guys it was accomplished. They speed off in the boat. Jennifer eventually cleans herself off [a totally brutal shot of her bloody body in the shower], and two weeks pass wherein she thinks about what happens and apparently gets stronger. She pieces her novel [which they ripped up] back together and starts writing again. And she plots her revenge.<br /><br />SPOILERS > > ><br />The guys haven't heard anything about her body being found, and they want to send Matthew up to check on her. Please take note of the ice cream sundae right in Matthew's face that really rather resembles a breast in this scene. It's a little funny [yet realistic] that they keep sending Matthew on these missions, yet they all know he is completely unreliable. Anyway, Matthew is working at the grocery store when he gets an order to take up to Jennifer's house. Also note that just behind the grocery bag, Matthew sees the butcher cutting a pig in half, with these two legs in the air and him cutting a bloody hole right in its crotch. I think this and the sundae are here to show how the rape is on Matthew's mind and its images and their meaning are stuck in his brain. He delivers the groceries, and Jennifer comes on to him, letting him have sex with her, when she slips a noose over his neck and hangs him over the river.<br /><br />Her next victim is the first rapist, whose name I didn't get. She pulls up to his mechanic shop and seduces him, then pulls a gun on him. He says that Stanley [the one who just wanted to hit her] made him do it, that he has a wife and kids, and that \\"a man is just a man\\" and she \\"MADE him see her sexy legs.\\" She seems to consider this; `well, I DID make him look at my sexy legs,' and lowers the gun. She then comes on to him again [and these morons fall for it] and tells him that he deserves a hot bath. She asks him about his wife and kids, then steps into the bath and castrates him. She then locks him in the bathroom to bleed to death, and listens to a Puccini opera while he screams and yells upstairs.<br /><br />The other two are dispatched with less vigor, but you will notice that in this case the phallic weapon she assumes IS the boat. She also has a great facial expression of knowing triumph after handily removing the axe from the hands of one of her former attackers. Stanley [the violent one] gets it last. Then she drives off and that's it, the movie ends.<br />&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS END<br /><br />This movie was much more intelligently and artfully done than I had imagined. This is not stupid or exploitative. I was really surprised at the amount of excellent, electrifying images there were here. I was also quite impressed with the way the movie treats the psychology of the rapists. I'm sort of used to men being treated as these animals who can barely restrain themselves to exist in society anyway, and then suddenly explode into sexualized violence, usually with a pack mentality [compare this film with the rape in The Accused]. What this movie got across in a way that was even more chilling than the idea that all men are rapists within is that the guys were just BORED. The movie spends a fair amount of time with them beforehand, so we know them as real people, and we can see what little excitement there is in their lives--and how exciting this \\"beautiful woman\\" from the city is. We understand that they objectify beautiful women and see them different from `normal' women in their discussion of whether beautiful women defecate and how all women from New York are \\"whores.\\" It seems that the whole, long rape sequence was not planned, but happened spontaneously when Matthew refused, and continued rolling from there. Then we see the fear and suspicion on the minds of the four rapists later. I'm not saying the film made apologies for them, they NEVER see Jennifer as a separate living being with her own intelligence and feelings, but what it does do is lay out their psychologies in much more detail then we usually get in movies.<br /><br />The question with films that depict a rape is always: does the movie glorify the rape? Or generate excitement in the audience with the rape? One could argue that anything depicted on film in a way glorifies it, but I think that the filmmakers take steps to minimize that effect here. As I said, there is no music, especially during the rape, and music in a film is usually used to encourage the audience to feel something, usually some form of excitement. Also, the aforementioned focus on the psychology of the men draws away from our being able to simply enjoy the rape in an unambiguous way, as does the extreme focus on Jennifer's pain, humiliation, and torment. The film shows long takes of her stumbling through the woods, covered in dirt and blood, and there's nothing exciting about it. The film also used the image of her naked and prostrate on the floor of her cabin not for excitement, but just to show her vulnerability and how brutal all this is. And I do have to say, this is without doubt THE most brutal movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />This movie is famous for being attacked by both Siskel and Ebert [separately] as the worst movie ever made and a total abomination. Their reviews got it pulled from the mainstream theater in which it was showing and, of course, inadvertently helped seal its notoriety. I wonder what Ebert would think of it if he were to view it again. To me it is a movie of unquestionable quality that just happens to take a very brutal and unflinching look at the psychological realities of rape, and the fantasies of revenge [the second half is markedly less realistic] one might have after having experienced it. The \\"reviews and articles\\" section on the disc nicely charts the film's reception from revulsion to some acceptance.<br /><br />This film was originally titled Day of the Woman, which one of the supportive writers in the accompanying articles thinks is a much better title, but I like I Spit On Your Grave. It sums up all of the enduring hatred and anger that the film taps into, and doesn't try to cast this film as a cultural piece about all women and how they all want revenge [a direction Ms .45 takes much more explicitly]. What IS a little disturbing is the way that the film was originally marketed. The trailers show very little of the rapes [and do not explicitly state in any way that the female character was raped], but instead concentrates on the woman stalking men. We are told that the Day of the Woman is \\"the ultimate day of terror.\\" Even the art on the current box shows a woman from behind, head out of frame, with tiny cut-off shorts. It seems that some of the people marketing this movie are some who most are in need of seeing it.<br /><br />SHOULD YOU WATCH IT?<br /><br />Regardless, a fascinating, totally brutal movie with a lot to say about rape and gender. Definitely worth watching, and definitely not for the faint of heart.o hit her] made him do it, that he has a wife and kids, and that \\"a man is just a man\\" and she \\"MADE him see her sexy legs.\\" She seems to consider this; `well, I DID make him look at my sexy legs,' and lowers the gun.

B0009P42S2|1.0|This film was an absolute embarrassment and a genuinely regretful waste of time.  It was lacking in nearly every regard, but, most importantly, it was devoid of any semblance of a coherent plot.  The characters were painfully shallow, and not a single one of them could lay claim to any redeeming qualities.  Any and all tension felt was the result of constant obnoxious explosions amidst the chaotic ridiculousness someone tried to pass off as a film.<br /><br />As the film transitions from one inane conversation to the next, perhaps the only thing worth taking note of is the excellent detail work that was put into making the backgrounds and crafting the environments.  Unfortunately, the backgrounds are relegated to inanity owing to the simple fact that valves and pipes are bursting endlessly from the opening minutes to the closing credits. The tension that should have been felt when key characters pulled what were described as important levers or turned similarly important valves was entirely negated since there seemed to be steam coming out of absolutely everything in the entire film.<br /><br />Never has a film striven so greatly toward exhausting its credibility budget.<br /><br />Do not waste your time with Steamboy.
B0017V7GTY|4.0|This band is not that unique in their chord progressions and sound, kind of a throwback band, mixing in parts of Springsteen, Tom Petty and Social Distortion. Every song on this CD is crafted to be a single, loaded with hooks and radio friendly appeal. I cannot dispute the fact that every song on this CD is really good. What makes this band more special than many in their genre are the very well crafted lyrics and driving percussion. The chord progressions might seem familiar and a tad commercial, but the words are very interesting and give the overall songs a lot more depth.  In hindsight I give this album five stars, but Amazon won't let me change my previous rating.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This series is a must have for anyone who appreciates quality acting with a healthy dose of cynicism.  The story premise is fresh and there are plenty of subplots occuring simultaneously with some interesting twists.  The lead actor has won several awards for his work and it is well deserved.    The show is definitely aimed at adults based on some of the content.

The lovely bones could describe every character in here, no flesh on them, everyone's a ghost of a character and the treatment of grief is superficial at best. Sorry, this one's overrated.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|\\"Slumdog millionaire\\" is a modern fable, an amazing fairy tale in the middle of the hopeless and the misery in one of the most overpopulated and unhealthy cities of the world.<br /><br />The genial idea to blend the brutal conditions of living of a good part of childhood around our world, remits us forcefully to those times of the Italian Neo Realism (De Sica's The shoemaker , Rosellini's Germany year zero) and the two sublime French masterpieces (Rene Clement's  \\"Forbidden games\\" and Truffaut's \\"Four hundred blows\\") with the splendor of the fifteen minutes of bombastic glory when the right answers collide with transcendental and random events of his miserable existence.<br /><br />Jamal is a motherless and homeless child whose hazardous existence walks at the razor's edge day after day. The countless obstacles he has to surmount will never make him to miss his romantic dream: Latika. So, he will keep an admirable personal ethic despite the abominable corruption and nasty social surroundings.<br /><br />Danny Boyle (whose previous cinematography experienced a dramatic turn with this masterwork) captured faithfully, the misery and the glory through a perfect edition whose dynamic rhythm process engaged the viewer from start to finish.<br /><br />With all fairness this film imposed itself above the rest of their competitors.

0767821769|4.0|\\"Stepmom\\" is an arresting existential drama about the lives and times of a fragmented couple(Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris) with two kids. He has a fianc&eacute;e (Julia Roberts) who has to deserve and then to win respect and affection from these two sensitive children whose unerring behavior is perpetual motive of comparison respect her. In order to melt this emotional iceberg, Roberts who is a successful professional photographer, will have to fight very hard to occupy her own place in the new state of things.<br /><br />With all these available dramatic premises, the expectations were too high. But the screenwriters bet for a tearful approach in the third movement of the play when a sudden twist of fate will intend to make us aware about the importance of the familiar values, above any serious conceptual difference between the new visitor and the original mother.<br /><br />The film is intense but the dramatic material promised even much more. Keeping in count the entire cast, it was a real waste.

B001P22HK8|2.0|This book started out fairly believably, but got more absurd by the page. When it reached the part where two automated motorcycles equipped with buzz saw robotic arms destroyed a building secured with steel doors, well, that pretty much did it for me.
B001D25MNE|4.0|As some other reviewers mentioned there is not much new in these two cd's, although I must say the quality of the tracks is excellent.  If you already have a couple of Chemical Brothers cd's or singles recopilations, you might not want to buy it.  If on the other hand you don't have other CB music, this is s fantastic set to have.  SO BE SMART AND THINK IT THROUGH BEFORE BUYING IT !!!!!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Subtly sophisticated and overtly hilarious, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is a gem. While these days I tend to prefer brainless crap over the usual Hollywood movies that are really about the environment or designed to dumb down society both intellectually and morally, Joss Whedon's Dr. Horrible is a clever philisophical masterpiece set to song. The movie's message is never explicitly stated, and is indeed debatable by those with functioning and perceptive minds. The actors are phenomenal---they almost seem born to play their parts. Of course, it also took great story- and song-writing skills as well as great direction to make it work so well. There isn't a person I wouldn't recommend this movie to.
B0018RBN8C|3.0|It's been a few monthes since I listened to this cd. I thought it was alot better then it was going to be. I never really got into the whole duffy thing since Amy Whinehouse was the first to come out with the british soul invasion thing. I think Amy,Adele, Kate Nash, have alittle more substance and better hooks. But anyways, this cd is actually pretty decent and this girl is very talented dispite what some critics might say. I did find her hit single from her kind of annoying, corny, and not that great. But there are a few gems on this album which makes it worth listening to. This is a perfect album if you want to relax, go on a long hike/walk, or your on a date. Other then that I think she might just be a one hit wonder from listening to this album.

B001PPLKI0|4.0|Nobody sings gospel like the King!  This is a great-sounding collection of Elvis' best gospel recordings.  How does it compare, you might ask, to the two previous Elvis gospel retrospectives - AMAZING GRACE: HIS GREATEST SACRED PERFORMANCES (1994) and PEACE IN THE VALLEY: THE COMPLETE GOSPEL RECORDINGS (2000)?  Quite well, actually.  I BELIEVE: THE GOSPEL MASTERS contains 54 of the 55 tracks from AMAZING GRACE.  The only missing track is \\"Miracle of the Rosary\\"; why that was left off, I have no idea.  As for the PEACE IN THE VALLEY collection, there are 21 tracks (22 if you count \\"Rosary\\") not found on I BELIEVE.  But unless you're a hard-core Elvis completist who has to have everything, there's a lot less missing than meets the eye; 12 of the missing 21 tracks are from the Million Dollar Quartet sessions, which can easily be found on THE COMPLETE MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET (2006); if you want the MDQ, why not buy the whole thing?  Of the remaining nine, seven are home or informal recordings (\\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\" from December 1956; \\"I Asked the Lord\\" and \\"He\\" from 1959-60; a 1:20 version of \\"Hide Thou Me\\" from 1966 (replaced on I BELIEVE by the longer 5:01 version from the TODAY, TOMORROW AND FOREVER box set (2002)); \\"Farther Along\\" and \\"Oh Happy Day\\" from 1970; and a giggle-filled version of \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" from 1971.  The other two missing tracks are the Ed Sullivan Show version of \\"Peace in the Valley.\\" which can be found on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOWS DVD set; and the 1977 live version of \\"How Great Thou Art\\" from ELVIS IN CONCERT, which was the King's last gospel recording before his death, but is not as good as the 1974 live recording.<br /><br />I BELIEVE also contains two tracks not found on the earlier compilations:  \\"I Was Born Ten Thousand Years Ago,\\"  from ELVIS NOW (1972) and the megahit single \\"If I Can Dream\\" from the '68 Comeback Special.<br /><br />The only changes that I would have made to this set (which is why it gets only 4 stars, not 5) would be to add \\"Miracle of the Rosary,\\"  the single \\"Where Did They Go, Lord\\" (from WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES - THE ESSENTIAL '70S MASTERS (1995)), and the full unedited Gospel Medley (including \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" with Darlene Love) that was issued on PEACE IN THE VALLEY and the compilation MEMORIES: THE '68 COMEBACK SPECIAL (1998).  I BELIEVE uses the edited version from the original ELVIS - NBC-TV SPECIAL album (reissued last year as part of THE COMPLETE '68 COMEBACK SPECIAL CD box set).<br /><br />Other than that, the set is perfect.\\"Miracle of the Rosary,\\"  the single \\"Where Did They Go, Lord\\" (from WALK A MILE IN MY SHOES - THE ESSENTIAL '70S MASTERS (1995)), and the full unedited Gospel Medley (including \\"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child\\" with Darlene Love) that was issued on PEACE IN THE VALLEY and the compilation MEMORIES: THE '68 COMEBACK SPECIAL (1998).

0688145078|5.0|The day this book came in the mail, my son who's almost four and who has always loved books tore the packaging off of the book and asked me to read it to him immediately. I read it to him every night for a week per his request. I love how this book is simple, gender-specific and very age-appropriate (it says 2-5 years). My son's favorite part is the description of the baby as being too little to walk, talk, etc. We have been getting him ready for the arrival of the baby since day one (he's been to every prenatal visit) and this book helped him some more. He looked at the picture of the I'm a Big  Sister Book in the back cover and he said he wanted to get that too for his cousin who recently became a big sister. I highly recommend this book for kids awaiting the birth of their sibling.

B00003CXB4|1.0|I ordered this DVD as a new product but when i received it it was very evident that it was not new. The case and wrapping were of the homemade sort. I didn't mind so much until I attempted to play the DVD and it skipped through more than half of the movie. I contacted the seller and he apologized and said he would send me a new one. After a week went by i hasn't received it I contacted the seller again stating that i hadn't received the new DVD and asking when it would be sent. I received no response. I gave him the benefit of the doubt thinking that when he received that email he would make sure it was sent. I waited another week and still no DVD. I sent another email to which I received no response. Well it has now been almost three(3) weeks since my orignal email and I have not received a replacement nor a response. I am very unhappy and I feel ripped off. My  next step will be to see what other options I have for recovering my money hopefully there is something that I can do. If you have any suggestions I welcome them. Beware when buying from this seller!
0743270754|4.0|The politicians under Lincoln's administration are refreshingly different from what we see in our current time.  Lincoln's integrity as an individual and his intelligence, work ethics, and his amazing ability to relate, empathize and communicate with the people have been so rare in our leaders.  The work and dedication of the rivals, inspite of conflicts, make this part of history dignifying and forever memorable.  I am grateful to the writer for explaining such complex process in a clear, engaging and entertaining way.  She is a great storyteller.

B00W81K9C8|5.0|First of all, Rutger Hauer automatically makes any movie gain a star, so I guess that makes this a six star review? At any rate, this a film from the 80's that lots of people liked to call mediocre because it has Matthew Broderick being his usual self, it's directed by the director of Superman and The Goonies, and it has a rockin' 80's soundtrack that's hecka catchy.<br /><br />I liked &#34;liked&#34; because I think like me, plenty of people are starting to realize (at long last) that this is probably the best film that Richard Donner ever made, and as a FILM, it is rather glorious. But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />First of all, there's wonderful casting. Michelle Pfeiffer's role is rather understated, but that perhaps works to the film's strangely realistic style. Rutger Hauer is absolutely amazing as always, and yeah you believe this guy is a super-heroic, and yet very human knight, with everything that implies (honor, strength, courage, and a bit of a superior attitude and self-righteous tint that is very grounded as well). On the supporting side you've got a priest played by the guy who was the con man in Candleshoe (who plays a wonderful character here) and the guy who was Prof. Falken in War Games. Yeah, he's the Big Bad, but he's more off-kilter and driven to darkness than outright evil or maniacal (again, making the film a lot more realistic). And of course Matthew Broderick fights an urge to steal the show with his charm, and makes an extremely likable thief caught up in supernatural events.<br /><br />The music is actually really great. It's a break from the super-realistic mood music in most films of this type, and does well to remind us this is ultimately an adventure story/fairy tale and not to be taken TOO seriously. You'll hate it the first time, and the second, and the third. And years later you'll start to really like after you've succumbed to it's catchiness. Oh and the real 80's rock music in the film is really good, if (again) understated.<br /><br />To me the real star of the film though, is the AMAZING cinematography from the man who made The Last Emperor and Apocalypse Now epic. The countryside in this film is like a character unto itself and needs to be seen widescree on a huge screen to be fully appreciated. I think in the end this film is actually an unappreciated epic that just somehow didn't connect as well as it should have because the 80's had a bit too much awesome for everyone to appreciate (other awesome unappreciated family friendly epics include The Neverending Story and The Black Stallion Returns).<br /><br />If you like fantasy films, Rutger Hauer, the 80's, great cinematography, and rock soundtracks that play while knights fight, this movie is one to own.ated.<br /><br />To me the real star of the film though, is the AMAZING cinematography from the man who made The Last Emperor and Apocalypse Now epic.

B000WMFZMY|4.0|If you love historical epics, this one is a must-see. All my life I've wondered what a Spanish knight would be like. And for a while now I've wondered if anyone actually had the kind of chivalry that knights were supposed to be famous for in legends. Now I finally know.<br /><br />At the start of the film the bloodthirsty Moores are preparing for a Jihad across Spain to wipe out the Christian Kings. One knight after fighting a battle against some of his Muslim adversaries decides to spare their lives if they will swear loyalty to his king. They do. As a result, he starts to build a reputation. The peace-seeking Muslims see his honor, loyalty, and valor, and start to refer to him as \\"The Sid\\", a brave warrior who works for peace. His king on the other hand is infuriated that he has spared his enemies. This chain of events sets in motion the rest of the film, wherein his wife-to-be becomes his enemy (after he is forced to duel her father who will not take back his accusations of treason from the man), his fights for and is eventually rejected by the kings of his country, and eventually leads a massive army of people loyal to him against the Warlord who could destroy all else at the cost of his own life.<br /><br />If anybody could play this part perfectly, its Charlton Heston, and he does. His true love, on the other hand, is less convincing. Sure, Sophia Loren has the looks, but I'm afraid she looks far more convincing in the scenes where she hates him than the ones where she loves him (lots of that towards the end of the film). Everyone else in the film is splendid, but it's the cinematography and grandness of the film that's the real star (like Hen Hur or the 10 Commandments). The castles, fields, besieged cities, and royal courts convey a story of magesty and splendor and good old chivalry in a way that just can't be done anyone (no one can afford that many extras).<br /><br />The one-on-one fight of champions to decide the fate of a city is my favorite part of the movie, because not only is it full of energy and power and drama (and excitement), but I've never seen anything like it on film. It's the stuff that teenagers dream of. Fighting for your leige lord so that armies won't have to, jousting, than fighting fiercely with broadswords. Awesome.<br /><br />The restoration of the film is nothing short of magical, with the widescreen and glorious color making it a shining example of the beauty of old Hollywood. There's also a fantastic musical score by the legendary Miklos Rozsa. The movie is worth seeing just for the cinematography and the music alone, but the great story and rock-solid acting by the ruggedly-good-looking Heston make it a must-see for every lover of historical epics in the grand tradition.ly is it full of energy and power and drama (and excitement), but I've never seen anything like it on film.

0312360266|3.0|To start, let me give you an idea of my background and methodology. I'm trained in literature (master's degree), teach writing in college, do some editing, and most of all love a good story. Despite being steeped in academia, I like to judge books based on how well they succeed at what they are trying to do, meaning I judge popular fiction as popular fiction and not by the parameters of \\"great literature\\"--I know enough to know such a thing can't really be clearly defined anyway. I love books. I love to read a good story; I even love YA fantasy, and prefer when it doesn't hold pretensions of grandeur because nothing ruins a book more than the author's attempts to write \\"great literature\\".<br /><br />This brings me to my review of the House of Night series. I enjoy the series, sometimes in spite of nearly everything, because the authors have created an interesting and rich story. The premise of vampires having always lived among humans and really being human's with a particular DNA strand having been triggered is unique and interesting. The challenges Zoey Redbird faces when she finds herself marked to either change into a vampire or die are satisfyingly compelling, and the further problems and challenges she finds in the politics of her new high school for those who have been marked are even more compelling, especially as the series progresses through plot twists, intrigue, and character development.<br /><br />Why then do I only give Marked and hence the books that follow three stars? It is because the interesting story is the only redeeming feature of the book, and it is sometimes overwhelmed by the writing, the stereotypical teen characters (who are sometimes indistinguishable from each other in voice and manner), and the author's need to pontificate through her first person narrator's thoughts (frequent references to \\"those stupid [insert despised group here]\\" who do things Zoey/the authors don't like, which is ironic given the other type of didacticism where the authors preach against forms of discrimination they don't like). A great deal of the time the writing and characters come across like a bad Nickelodeon high school movie, though they do show more redeeming qualities and personalities in the midst of the action. The following books, because they follow the overarching plot more actively are more palatable (more meaningful action, less high school blah.) Marked, since it is primarily concerned with typical high school drama nearly allows the interesting story to be completely overwhelmed; it does however set up the main plot line which becomes more interesting with each book.<br /><br />The interesting storyline of the series as a whole is all that keeps me from giving this one or two stars, but I still found it a fun read.

B00005BJPO|5.0|In the year 2018, World War 3 has passed, and the world is still around. Everything seems about the same, but just a lot crummier. Kaneda and Tetsuo are friends from a young age that are now around 18 years old and in a biker gang with some of their other good friends. They are at war with another biker gang called the Clowns, and get into fight with their bikes in the middle of the streets and highways. While Tetsuo is chasing down another biker, he almost runs over a little kid in the middle of the street, except that his bike blows up and leaves Tetsuo flat on the ground... thanks to the kid. The military comes to grab the child and also takes Tetsuo back to a military installation to perform some experiments on him that unlocks a great, though lethal, power inside of him.  As Tetsuo is trying to break out, Kaneda is trying to break in to find and rescue his friend. The power though that is swirling inside of Tetsuo is beginning to take control of him and what Kaneda finds later is not the Tetsuo he remembers.<br /><br />I remember seeing this 1988 movie somewhere around 1994 and being absolutely blown away. The attention to detail was something like I had never seen before in movie cartoons. The backgrounds were robust with moving people, cars, papers, lights, anything really. The movements in the actual drawings that we were supposed to be watching were so fluid and meticulously drawn it was mesmerizing. Even after 20 years, this movie still holds up. Just last night as I was watching this I looked at my friend many times and said \\"Holy crap man, that looked so good\\". The first thing I remember from this movie from so long ago was the bike fight scene at the beginning. The first time I saw the trail of light from the break lights as a bike zoomed off, I believe my nipples got a little hard. That's how awesome it was. And there are even some pretty `gross' scenes in this movie. Like when a guy gets his face bashed on a drive by with a lead pipe. I \\"OOOOOOO'd!!\\" out loud to that... haha. The story itself though can get a little confusing. I think it took me 3 or 4 seeings to actually get it. Mainly cause I was to in awe the whole time just watching the movie.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely give this movie a shot. I own it and love that I do. If you are an anime fan, you'd better have seen this cause this movie has to be in the top 5 best animes ever.<br /><br />P.S. - I own the tin can 2 disc edition. LOVE IT. Also the scene that ALWAYS sticks out in my head in this movie is the hallway scene where he blows people up. It was drawn so fluidly well it's ridiculous.d to that... haha.

031606792X|5.0|As an avid fan of fantasy and YA fantasy, I found this series one of my all time favorites, and Breaking Dawn is my favorite book of the series. I felt it supremely presented the culmination of all the themes that had been building in the previous three books.    To give you some perspective on who I am and how I read books, I have a master's degree in literature, but I mostly try and ignore such training and just take a book on its own terms. I don't attempt to compare books to some academic ideal of what \\"literature\\" should be, but instead try and judge young adult popular fiction on what it wants to be: popular, entertaining, idealistic. Breaking Dawn supremely satisfied my expectations and needs for gripping entertainment.    From the slew of disappointed reviews, I gather that a great many fans did not find this a perfect climax to the series, which makes me wonder if we even read the same series. The first three books were a continual catalog of everything Bella and Edward pay for their love. The fourth book adds to that price tremendously when Bella finds herself pregnant after their honeymoon and decides that her love for Edward only grows and culminates with love for their child, which she must risk death to give birth to (every mother is at risk of dying in childbirth, but not usually at such a high level.) With the birth of Renesmee and Bella's transformation into a Vampire (I thought it fitting that Bella found she could control her infant vampire bloodlust because will power was Bella's defining strength through the whole series: she decided to love Edward no matter what, she decided to hold to her love for him despite his denouncement of he own feelings and the tempting alternative Jacob offered, she decided to die trying to save Edward despite what he had put her through because her unfailing will empowered her love even if she doubted his. The books have continually highlighted Bella's will-power; does it not make sense that such a will would transmit into making a decision not to kill any humans when she is a vampire and sticking to it? It does to me.    So, Bella gets everything, only to find out that the more you have; the more you have to lose. For older readers who know the love of a mature relationship based on common goals and trials especially those of parenthood, the tension of the end of Breaking Dawn is perfect; it is the tension of having a family in the face of a brutal world seemingly designed to destroy what we care about most. I agree with other reviewers that those who were disappointed likely don't have the life experiences to appreciate the success of Breaking Dawn.    If your idea of an ideal love is the obsessive and irrational passion of the first book, you would be disappointed by the last. If your idea of ideal love is that of the star-crossed lovers whose obsessional passion seems doomed to always be denied by fate as in New Moon, your would be disappointed. If your idea of an ideal love is a love triangle like in Eclipse, you'd likely be disappointed, but if you understand that all these things are transitory things as temporary as they are hyperbolic which will either lead nowhere or else develop into a mature and meaningful relationship that grows through commitment, sacrifice, and a dedication to something beyond yourselves (family) then like me you'll find Breaking Dawn a perfect ending to the Twilight Saga. Bella may get everything she wants, but the book perfectly highlights the dangers of happiness and the impossibility of an ending.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|It's 1973 and William Miller (Patrick Fugit) is about to have one of the craziest adventures of his lifetime. He's writing a piece on the new up and coming rock band Stillwater for the magazine Rolling Stones. He's going to get to go on tour with them and write about anything he wants about them for the next month or so. First though he has to get permission from him mom (Frances McDormand)... because he's only 15.<br /><br />Before he gets this little gig, he's trying to get an interview with Black Sabbath when he meets Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), who's not just a groupie, but a Band-Aid. The difference being, she's in it for the music and not the sex with someone popular. Penny is definitely one of those `out of this world' types of girls. Not just in looks, but in her actions as well. She's a legend to the rock bands because she's just so much fun to have around, and she can always light up a room when she steps into it. She tugs on the tendrils of every heart of every man who comes into contact with her. But the only man she truly wants is Russell Hammond.<br /><br />Will is accepted as a friend and not just `the enemy' as usual by the band members of Stillwater. Most notably by Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) and Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee). Jeff is the lead singer and Russell is the lead guitarist and also heart throb of the group. While Jeff is sort of an open book for Will, it's Russell he's a bit more interested in, mainly because Russ never really gives that interview he's looking for, but more than not just some one liner quotes. As time goes on, we see how the band has some inner turmoil due to Russell's looks. He's becoming the front man of the band when it was supposed to be Jeff, like the plan was. Just like a lot of bands, this one started off great, but slowly, it could be coming to an end.<br /><br />I absolutely love this movie. Every time I watch it I have a big smile on my face almost the whole the time. From the atmosphere to the music to the settings to the parties, everything just makes me happy. Maybe it's because somewhere deep down in me I'm a rock star myself. Sure I can't sing, nor play an instrument (recorders don't count!), but by god I'm a rock star! The whole story is so much fun to watch unfold. Getting to witness the first time William gets to go back stage to the first time he gets to hang out at a hotel party, all the while making sure he calls his mom in the morning to check in, is just so much fun.<br /><br />I actually watched `The Bootleg Cut' of this movie to do this review, and I'm pretty sure it was the first time I ever watched it. It's mostly the same, but more Penny Lane. Those parts were good but there were some parts that I still thought that should've been left out. For instance one scene has Will writing some paper, and his sisters ex comes in his window and starts talking to him about nonsense. It felt very weird and definitely should've been left out. Some scenes I could see why they were left out but were ok I guess. Like a scene that involves Stillwater going to a radio station and doing and interview with a drugged out DJ. It was kind of funny and also a little informative of the situation between Russ and Jeff. But they also left out some scenes. I don't remember them all, but I do remember one. It was the scene where Will is in the hotel room and has some of the girls jumping around him and basically it's left to us, but he has sex with them, which is his first time having sex. They left that out. That was a great scene, so I don't know why it was taken out. Oh well.<br /><br />Also all the actors were great. Kate Hudson was very good, and I love the scene where Will tells her someone sold her for 50 bucks and a case of beer. She starts to cry just a tad, and then asks, \\"What kind of beer?\\" and smiles with a tear still rolling down her face. That was awesome. Patrick Fugit was good also, being the nice, sweet, and innocent kid and getting introduced to the life of the rock star.Jason Lee rocked his part perfectly. He just had that 70's rock band swagger with the long hair flowing and not a care in the world except for his band being awesome. I also liked Billy Crudup and really everyone that was in Stillwater. They just seemed like a real band. So real I'd love to get a faux poster of the actual actors in their get up with a big STILLWATER above them. And Frances McDormand was just phenomenal as the mom of William. You honestly couldn't help love her. She was a great mom, even though a little crazy. You could tell she loved her kids, but was just a little too protective (so the movie makes you think). I actually thought she wasn't that protective though like the movie makes her out to be. Seriously she let her 15 year old kid go on tour with Stillwater to write for the Rolling Stones. At 15 I had to be home by 8pm and 9pm on weekends.<br /><br />It was also fun to see a lot of cameos. Jimmy Fallon (a little more than a cameo), Nick Swardson, Peter Frampton, Zack Ward, Martin Starr, and a lot more.<br /><br />In the end, man I would definitely say own this movie and make it the bootleg edition. That way you can watch both movies versions. I would DEFINITELY watch the award winning Theatrical Version first though.<br /><br />P.S. - The bootleg edition comes with a 6 song EP of Stillwater. I love this CD. `Fever Dog' sounds so good as well as the other songs. I just wish I knew who really sang these songs..

0471702188|3.0|I work for one of the largest banks in the US, and we use this book as a reference when we need to dig into the more arcane details of a project.   If you do a lot of valuation work, this is a recommended text, but it is tome-like and a bit laborious to use, and I've found much of the advice it contains is rather ivory tower and not-so-practical in real world situations.  If you are studying valuation theory, or do a lot of this work, particularly on publicly-held companies, you'll definitely want this textbook, though over time it might not be the one you reach for everyday.  To accompany it, I would suggest also buying  Horn's \\"Unlocking the Value of a Business\\" for everyday use, which is a more concise and user-friendly manual on privately-held company valuation, with a more lighthearted, less-academic tone, and Horn's credentials as an acquisitions dealmaker yield advice that is decidedly more practical.

The story winds the reader through the war torn streets of Barcelona with enough twists and turns to pique your interest.

Even if you're not planning a vacation soon, get this book and it'll take you on a vacation each time you open it.

0307454894|2.0|I think something was lost in translation.  There's an excellent story buried between two covers, it's simply one-dimensional, lacking humanity, feeling, hollow?  I really don't know what was wrong with it.  I do know I felt like a doctor was describing the symptoms of the characters.  A bit sterile for me.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this movie, the only downside is that Heath cannot reprise his role as the joker, and seeing as how effective the character's story line was so dark and strong, You can't expect anyone to step-up and follow heaths jokers, its impossible for anyone else to do it like the way he did, from voice to movement to telling his scar stories.<br /><br />This movie is a Win Win situation no matter how you look at it, the only issue is Maggie Gyllenhaal, she seems like a extra in the movie, unlike Katie Holmes's version

B0010X8NF0|4.0|The fascinating and beautifully-filmed locations in India, coupled with the entertaining interaction between the three American brothers at the center of the story, work together to make \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" an easy film to recommend.  An eclectic soundtrack and some genuine emotional depth are other plusses.  Extra features on the DVD are few but interesting; they include a short film, \\"Hotel Chevalier\\", that functions as a kind of prologue to \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\", and a twenty-minute or so glimpse behind the scenes of the making of the film.
B001EOQWFI|1.0|I could only see this movie only once and that's it. I did not liked this movie at all. Complete waste of money. You will not see this movie again and again. How could Disney bring such poor movie?
B0011NVC9I|4.0|This engaging, entertaining movie is an agreeable combination of fast-paced popcorn entertainment and literate, myth-based story telling.  The animation is so realistic, however, that one wonders why they bothered animating the thing at all rather than just filming it live-action and just animating the special effects, the way \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" was done.  In any event, this is an intense, exciting film that will more than fit the bill for a memorable home-viewing experience, expecially if you have a decent flatscreen television.  The director's cut DVD has a few more snippets of violence (and possibly a little more of Angelina Jolie's character) on display, as well as a lavish array of extra features.  While not beyond criticism, any shortcomings of \\"Beowulf\\" stand as quibbles compared to the overall success of director Robert Zemekis' ambitious project.
1594481717|5.0|It's not unusual for parents to gently (and sometimes not so gently) push their children toward careers in engineering, legal, health care or accounting fields. However, in his book - A Whole New Mind - author Daniel Pink says those types of analytical or \\"left-brain\\" professions may not be the best bet for the future. In the book, Pink uses the dualistic nature of our brains - right side versus left side - as a metaphor to illustrate the dynamic nature of our times. The writer goes on to state that a new economy is emerging where \\"right-brain\\" thinkers who exhibit empathy, creativity and inventiveness will thrive. Soundview recommends this book because it offers a fresh look at what it will take for future iterations of organizations (as well as individuals) to succeed. Specifically, the book reveals six essential qualities that it explores as critical factors for personal and professional success in the future. Those aptitudes include:  meaning, play, empathy, symphony, story and design. So get this book and get into your \\"right mind.\\"
0375507256|5.0|CLOUD ATLAS poses the following questions: Just what exactly is \\"civilization\\"? What happens when it falls apart? Furthermore, is there hope for humanity in the long run?<br />In this book, DAVID MITCHELL demonstrates that if you examine any so-called \\"civilized\\" society, you will find it rife with the very worst traits of human nature: racism, sexism, ageism, corruption, theft, murder, sexual abuse, slavery and ultimately self-destruction.<br />These evils are explored in a series of six stories which take place at different points in time. The first, \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing\\", chronicles a 19th century ocean voyage. The final one takes place in Hawaii, in the distant future, many generations after a nuclear holocaust.<br />In the first half of the book, we are given only the first half of each tale, leaving the fate of its main character unresolved. That is, with the exception of the sixth tale, \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin After\\", told in its entirety, which is the chronological turning point in the book. After this, the book picks up the second half of each of the previous tales in reverse order. And although each tale is very different from the others, Mitchell has found a clever way of having each nested inside the next like a set of matryoshka dolls. For instance, the first story is written as a journal, and this journal appears in the second story. A musical composition in the second one reappears as a rare LP in the third one, and so on.<br />Also, although the main character in each story is very distinct and different from the others, there are two strong unifying threads throughout. The first is that, in each tale, the protagonist becomes caught in a rip-tide of events, struggling to not allow him or herself be victimized by seemingly civilized people. The second is hints that he or she may be a reincarnation of the character in the previous story. Although we appear to be meeting an entirely new character each time, we are in fact watching the same soul engaged in the very same type of struggle over and over again, but with different people in different settings and in different eras. The overall effect is like watching a salmon trying to fight its way upstream and falling back over and over again, narrowly avoiding being dashed on the rocks.<br />But all is not lost. The concluding half of every narrative but one sees its main character triumph over his or her predicament. In fact, by the time the reader arrives back at the end of the very first tale, we are left with two positive conclusions. The first is that, even if the majority of people are evil, all it takes is one strong individual with conviction to change society for the better. The second is that there still will always be hope for the human race.engaged in the very same type of struggle over and over again, but with different people in different settings and in different eras.

031606792X|2.0|This series  has captivated me from the beginning....I loved Bella and Edward's \\"impossible but destined\\" love in the book Twilight.  I was horrified when Edward left in New Moon, but found myself loving Jacob and his love for Bella...(to the point that I wanted Edward to \\"stay gone\\"!)  I then jumped into Eclipse (my favorite of the series)!  The love triangle between Bella/Edward/Jacob is one of the \\"best done\\" in all the triangles I've seen.  Then came Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />Why did I give in and read it?  I should've left well enough alone and stopped at New Moon.  At least I could've left this series feeling \\"respected\\".  Now I just feel duped.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />I loved the first 138 pages.  I wish they would've been the final chapters of Eclipse and the series would've ended there.  No baby, no weird pregnancy, no emaciated Bella, no horrific birth, no imprinting on an infant, no strange plot to kill the \\"baby\\" who is growing and developing rapidly.......just plain stupid and insulting to my time and intelligence.  I will try to erase the damage this book has done to my overall feelings about this series, but I'm afraid the damage might already be done.<br /><br />My advise.... Skip this one and live out your life in peaceful ignorance of this disaster!
B0017I1FNK|4.0|I really like parts of this record. Some points are breathtaking.<br /><br />My only complaint about this record is that it is obvious to the listener that it was recorded over a serious time span and it became inconsistent with the production. It opens and closes very strong, the middle is the best, but the other sandwiching tracks really detract for me (ie: Kern River is just a distraction that i cringe at)<br /><br />She wrote some good stuff for this, I would have loved more from her, she doesn't give herself enough credit as being a prolific songwriter... but her cover of Tracy Chapman's All That You Have Is Your Soul is killer, it is easy to repeat over and over and over.<br /><br />She continues her life reflection on this record, I guess that is what age brings...<br /><br />I do highly recommend the record to be among the top 5 of Emmylou records to own... the others are: Cimmeron, Wrecking Ball, Red Dirt Girl, and Pieces of the Sky.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have read the series dozens of times,and i love it. The show is by far the best show on T.V. right now. It touches subjects that are real although giving it an air of fantasy. I am addicted to the show and I got upset when it was taken from ONDEMAND, and now HBO is airing it on Saturdays at 9pm, and i cant wait until Season2 comes out. I t will be even better and sexier than season 1. It is THE SHOW to watch.The books are awsome, but the show is on a tied on that description. It is a DVD box worth having cause you wont get tired of watching it over and over.  Love,Love,Love TRUE BLOOD

080701429X|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning changed my life for better by giving a compassionate view of our shared struggles to understand and overcome the evil we are willing to do to each other.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a straight forward narrative of Viktor Frankl's years in various concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Frankl was a neurosurgeon and psychiatrist whose insights into the experience of grotesque devaluation of life are priceless.<br /><br />The second part of the book are the beginning observations that lead to developing a new psychological school, \\"Logotherapy\\".<br /><br />Cherishing this book, I bought this copy for a lifer in the \\"hole\\" in prison. He reports that it has calmed him down a great deal. Hopefully he will find a meaning to his life...

B0013N7AD8|5.0|Great set of all four original Batman movies. The quality of the picture and sound are by far the best I've seen and heard for these movies. The special features are even better. You get a bunch of things such as commentary by both directors, featurettes, music videos and a six part documentary through all four of the films. It even makes Batman and Robin more enjoyable even though it is the worst one of them all.    This set,however, could been absolutely seen as a rip off to people who own the set on 8 disc regular dvd as it has the same special features that was on the previous one that was discontinued but now reavailable again. Is it worth the money for bluray? If and only if you never owned the box set before. I never owned it and when I found out it would be rereleased I figure I would spend the extra 24 dollars and get it on bluray(59.99 for regular; 84.99 for bluray).I only owned the old version of the first three that had no special features at all, so it was a no brainer for me and well worth it.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|Weird, documentary style film that shows the original days of body building in the steroid era. These guys are freaks of nature ( well maybe not so natural!) All these guys do is body build, go to shows, show off, and body build some more. Arnold was the king, or at least that is what the movie contends. Lou Ferigno is the underdog. Best scene in the whole movie is the guy who is standing behind Lou at the gym with his pot belly lifting 5 pounds weight looking like he is half asleep, while Lou is lifting hundreds of pounds. I want to know where that guy is today....<br />This movie is a cult classic and is a must see for anyone who has ever trained, for any type of sport.
B001PPGAIK|4.0|This movie is entertaining and the scenery is beautiful on Blu-Ray. However, it is definitely a Hollywood story and after seeing the movie, it's analogies with Gone with the Wind are striking. Different Tara, Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara, but same storyline. Overall, entertaining, but not overly intellectual.Not the best movie of all time, but also not the worst.
B001TODCII|4.0|Whoa!  \\"Taken\\" written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel moves quickly through its 94 minutes with the assuredness of a film that makes no claim to be anything than what it is--pure adrenaline producing action that entertains.<br /><br />Don't expect any hidden political agendas or veiled messages about the state of the world.  Don't analyze each and every segment thinking that every \\"i\\" will be dotted and every \\"t\\" crossed.  Just sit back, buckle an imaginary seatbelt and prepare yourself for a wild ride driven by the pathos of a loving father whose winsomely innocent daughter finds herself at the mercy of the big bad world.<br /><br />\\"Taken,\\" starring the ever-endearing Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA operative whose one-track mind seems rooted in the desire of seeing Kim, his gangly, albeit charmingly so, seventeen year old daughter maturing happily and comfortably under his meticulous auspices despite the fact that she lives apart from him with her rather angry mother (Famke Janssen) and rich stepfather, shoves the nasty demimonde of crime organized to feed the exploitive tastes of rich degenerates in our faces.  As horrific as all this is, the quick pace of the story, forces us to react as quickly as Neeson does as he forges along through his once familiar stomping ground foiling the plans of an Albanian gang intent on human trafficking when they snatch the virginal Kim during a vacation in Paris.<br /><br />Neeson takes no prisoners.  He is a one-man killing machine.  Ludicrously, the bullets fly, the fists slam into faces and kidneys with the same lethal accuracy displayed by celluloid hero, Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon but without Bourne's robotic nonchalance.  Papa Neeson's face bleeds with anguish raw enough for the audience to warily sense like some automatic hormonal discharge that one can smell and taste and rawer still to barely interpret as something so distressful, lingering on it for too many seconds would shatter the rationale to a point of being unable to function.  Neeson conveys this reaching of his emotional limit and his need to turn away from dwelling on it to perfection.  As he stumbles through a tented makeshift whorehouse on a construction site, pulling back curtain after curtain revealing one stoned and under-aged girl after another, we see the pain in his eyes.  The images flash with such feral brutality and stark intensity that we know he must push them from his mind to achieve the goal of finding his girl. Neeson works this part with such emotional nuance, that when he flattens each of his adversaries, there is no question in the audience's mind on how he did it.  We simply believe it.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"Taken\\" follows the Bourne trilogy school of rapid-fire action cinema.  Its fun, escapist fare and Liam Neeson hones his part like a master craftsman as a concerned papa looking out for his only daughter.  Some grisly scenes of torture, adult themes of sexual slavery and stereotypical Eastern European and Middle Eastern bullies abound.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|It takes a bit to warm up to any new gaming device that substantially changes the way you play a game and the G13 Advanced Gameboard is no different.  In some ways, it provides a steeper learning curve simply because, when you first get into it, it's not user-friendly.      The problem with the G13 is the software.  It's terrible.  It's also completely necessary.  The way the device works is that the software allows you to set up profiles for your games; ostensibly, this allows you to have different key bindings for each game.  The program comes packaged with profiles for a ton of games and each profile that's mirrored with a game has standard key bindings.  The software even comes with a auto-search command that will locates all of the available games on your PC and assign the correct standard profile to them.    Unfortunately for me, and for a lot of users I discovered, the auto-search function doesn't always locate your games.  In my case, it only discovered Lord of the Rings Online, not Bioshock, Call of Duty, Guild Wars or any of my Steam games.  I've seen a variety of people posting their thoughts as to why this is, with most of them hanging onto the idea that if you have games saved on a different hard drive than the normal C drive it won't locate them.  That wasn't the case for me, as LoTRO is on the same drive as the rest of my games (the A drive) and it found LoTRO but nothing else.  You can manually attach a profile to a game by locating the .exe file, which I had to do for each game, and the problems kind of continued.      Compounding this, the software doesn't load all of the available profiles.  This is supposed to be a nicety because you won't have an ungainly list of profiles when you want only a few.  However, if the system doesn't locate the game file, it doesn't load the profiles, thereby making you go the long way in setting up a profile/key mapping from scratch.  While LoTRO was a cinch to set up and make changes the key mappings, every other game caused me to start from ground zero which can be a time-consuming prospect if you want to get it just right and remember which keys you need.    I thought about updating my software, and it includes an \\"update now\\" button.  Unfortunately, pressing that told me I had no available updates, which was false I discovered later.  I went online searching for profiles because I didn't have any loaded except for LoTRO and discovered a patch on the Logitech website for the device.  This is another annoyance.  If you're going to offer the awesome \\"update now\\" function, why wouldn't you have it, you know, update now?      Once you tire of the software and try the device you might be put off.  I know I was.  It took awhile for me to be used to it, but give it a week and you'll never want to go back.  I'm in love with the actual hardware.  It's suitably ramped for comfort; the cushioned pad to rest your wrist on is fantastic, the incline is perfect and the buttons are nicely set apart for easy access.  I love the little joystick on the side as it gives me the feel of a console controller for movement, the multitude of keys and the mouse for the PC feel.  I love it and use it for both MMOs and FPSs.      Additionally, you can set up a few profiles for each game.  So if you'd want to play the game differently, depending on the character/class you're playing, you can do so.  The keys have back lighting, which is nice, and you can set pretty much any color (using a color palette) you'd desire for each of the profiles.  Then there's the LCD screen that can show you a variety of different things.  It tells me the song and artist I'm listening to, RSS feeds of news items of interest, a timer/cooldown counter or, in the case of LoTRO, your health/power and other pertinent information.  It's kind of a cool little feature.    To put it succinctly: I love the hardware, I dislike the software.  If the software did as it was supposed to (auto-search for games, update when it should) and was easier to manuever in, it wouldn't be so bad.  But as it is, it's just an annoyance that gets in the way of what really shines.  This is a nice piece of equipment.  It's changed the way I play games and I will never go back to just using the keyboard.      As a final example of the dichotomy between the two, I went from playing LoTRO to Guild Wars (which the software couldn't locate).  I started putting in keys by hand for it when I just decided against it due to the length of time it was taking and went back to the keyboard.  As I was playing, I kept wishing for the joystick and the nicely laid out keys, but I didn't have the time last night to fully get the keys to my liking. After playing only with the G13 for almost a month, I missed it more than anything, but the software kept getting in my way.    So...please, Logitech...do something good with that software.
B001N3OCV6|5.0|A number of reviewers have taken this soundtrack to task for its omissions - and, yeah, I was really surprised and disappointed \\"99 Luftballons\\" wasn't included (although only 20-some seconds were used in the film perhaps the filmmakers didn't realise the indelible mark it would leave!).    Still, this being the age of the internet and MP3s it is very easy to make your own 'Complete' Watchmen soundtrack as several websites have already posted the movie's tracklisting.    First off, I bought both soundtracks, the Various Artists and the Tyler Bates Score edition (which, incidentally, is VERY good - has an intensity and darkness that the film's pop tunes overshadow). Also, the CDs come with terrific internal artwork - honestly, worth the price of buying them alone.    For a few extra $s you can pop over to Amazon's MP3 download section and create you own version of the soundtrack: I ripped the original CD into my computer then supplemented it with 6 others featured both in the movie and its trailers, all downloaded from Amazon's MP3 catalogue. I then burned them all onto one 80 minute CD (an * denotes the additional songs which I downloaded).       1) Take a Bow - Muse*  2) The Beginning Is The End Is The Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins*  3) Unforgettable - Nat King Cole  4) The Times They Are a-Changin - Bob Dylan  5) 99 Luftballons - Nena*  6) The Sound Of Silence - Simon & Garfunkel  7) Me And Bobby McGee - Janis Joplin  8) I'm Your Boogie Man - KC & The Sunshine Band  9) You're My Thrill - Billie Holiday  10) Pruit Igoe & Prophecies - Philip Glass  11) Everybody Wants To Rule The World - Tears for Fears*   12) Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen  13) Clyde - Waylon Jennings*  14) All Along The Watchtower - Jimi Hendrix  15) Desolation Row - My Chemical Romance  16) First We Take Manhattan - Leonard Cohen*  17) Pirate Jenny - Nina Simone    Total running time: approx. 76 mins.    I left out \\"Ride Of The Valkyries\\" as this would have taken the running time to 81 mins. Besides,chronologically it falls between Simon & Garfunkel and Janis Joplin - and, dude, that's just wrong! But, seriously, \\"Valkyries\\" completely jars: and, anyway, Apocalypse Now already 'owns' that tune.    Tracks 1) and 2) featured to great effect in the movie's trailers and 16) was the second song used in the end credits. Yes, I know, it was actually the Muzak version of \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" which was used in the movie - but, really, who wants that?!
B000059XUI|4.0|I saw just the Richard Lester version and thought it was an excellently thought out film.  Paris, France.  Terrorists with a nuclear bomb.  Before it goes off, Superman throws it into space, however its detonation breaks the Phantom Zone shield. and out pop three Kryptonian criminals originally locked up by Supe's dad. Doh!!<br /><br />The film flies from there, explores relationships between Lois and Clark, between Zod and his fiends, and Lex Luthor attempting to get more \\"beach front property.\\"<br /><br />Special effects seem secondary to the plot and characters.  We even see new powers such as a repulsor ray from the fingers and Superman's amnesia kiss, outlined in the first film.<br /><br />Lois gets Supes to admit Clark Kent is Superman.  What the heck???  See what develops.<br /><br />Can't wait to see the Richard Donner version with more scenes and excellent filling out of the plot.<br /><br />Recommend other Reeve books and films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000IJ79WU Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut]]<br />[[ASIN:0345470737 Nothing is Impossible: Reflections on a New Life]]<br />[[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]]

B000EQ47GS|5.0|This was the first album I ever had.  I actually got this from my brother in the form of an 8-Track, after he sold me his car and left the tape.  One listen and I was HOOKED.  That was in 1982 and I was a sophomore in HS.  I subsequently bought the cassette (which I wore out) and the CD in 1986 (at the time Third Stage came out).  Now it's on my MP3 and will forever be in my music library.    Over the past 25+ years, I can say that the sound quality of this album was as good or better than anything that was put out at the time, save for Queen.    I love EVERY song on this album, but if I HAD to pick my favorite, it would be Foreplay/Long Time.  The song just kicks.    If you are younger than 30 and would like to know what it felt like to be a teenager in the late 70's and early 80's, this album is for you.  Good times they were.
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|Madeleine Peyroux has an exquisite, almost other-worldly gift for intense, profoundly beautiful phrasing, and she is a talented musician as well. But can she also pen the tunes? \\"Bare Bones\\" answers affirmatively with its 11 pleasureful song selections.<br /><br />With 2006's \\"Half the Perfect World\\" Peyroux seemed a bit self-conscious and under pressure; some of the cover choices did not allow her honeyed voice room to shine, and her three originals were enjoyable but forgettable - one could sense her pressure to produce a follow-up that would repeat the success of 2004's \\"Careless Love,\\" a classic if ever there was one. (By the way, the best recording from the \\"Half the Perfect World\\" sessions is a tune that did not make the disc - Peyroux's exquisite, achingly beautiful cover of Randy Newman's \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\" was only available in select markets and as a bonus track from selected retailers. However, the tune can be purchased on the 2007 compilation album \\"Give Us Your Poor,\\" available on Amazon.com, and can be purchased a la carte digitally. It is well worth the effort.)<br /><br />Things feel differently this time around, however - Peyroux has truly found her voice as a songwriter, and the results are wonderful. Partly eschewing the brooding melancholy of her past works, she strikes a different overall key with \\"Bare Bones\\" in that she finds optimism and even levity in her psychological exploration of life's tapestry, and she need not resort to simplicities or cliches to convey her rich, nuanced observations. The album's title comes into play not only sonically but thematically - Peyroux cuts to the marrow of her own existence and by extension that of her listeners, articulating through song thoughts and feelings that words alone cannot often express, acknowledging life's pain and hardships but still finding reason to smile and bask in its glow. The songs are immediately revelations of her distinct creative voice, affirmations of her sheer vocal grace and, importantly, comfortable and familiar.<br /><br />\\"Our Lady of Pigalle\\" may be the album's most inspired moment with its gorgeous melody conveyed by rich, buoyant acoustic guitar. Peyroux sings with utmost grace and soothing aura. Her wistful, slow-burning approach to singing is an immediate invitation to listeners to slow down and breathe deeply, perhaps with a glass of wine in hand. While nearly all the tracks save for the ultra funky \\"You Can't Do Me\\" (its offbeat, endearingly oddball lyrics betray Peyroux's writing partner as Walter Becker of Steeley Dan) retain this calming, late night atmosphere, Peyroux's gift for melody rings clear - these songs, while in the same sonic palette, remain distinct from one another and with charms all their own.<br /><br />Another moving, instantly memorable selection is \\"Damn the Circumstances\\" with its simple, resonating hook: (\\"Damn the circumstances/Life is hard enough\\").<br /><br />The upbeat opener \\"Instead,\\" meanwhile, is a sweet, thoughtful ode to optimism that retains an edge of levity without being hackneyed or trite.<br /><br />(\\"Instead of feeling bad/Be glad you got somewhere to go/Instead of feeling sad/Be happy you're not all alone/Instead of feeling low/Get high on everything you love.\\")<br /><br />Other exemplary tracks include the poetic, devoted \\"I Must Be Saved\\" (lovingly dedicated to folk legend Odetta in the liner notes), the contemplative, autobiographical title track and the stark, low-key closer \\"Somethin' Grand,\\" which Peyroux dubs her \\"Obama song.\\"<br /><br />(\\"There's somethin' grand coming/Cool strumming through my empty city/'Till the new day breaks and weary eyes are clear/Dreams of sleep take troubles far away from me/All is forgiven\\").<br /><br />Peyroux is an exemplary artist of this era regardless of musical persuasion. If we could rest assured that all singers would have her clarity of conviction, sheer range of expression and dedication to the craft we would know great joy. Shewas already a pleasure to the ears, but \\"Bare Bones\\" boldly stakes new artistic ground and wins, all the while retaining the essence of what made her previous releases significant. It immediately reaffirms and recontextualizes her career, at once evidencing Peyroux not only as a talent to reckon with but one yet to receive her critical and commercial due. Could this be her time?artistic ground and wins, all the while retaining the essence of what made her previous releases significant.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|This was a well made and well acted movie.  However, if you are looking for a movie that will scare you, then this is not it.  It is probably 45 percent drama, 45 percent love story and maybe 10 percent horror.  If you like movies like Twilight, then this is good for you.  If you are looking to get scared, then you need to watch something else, as this will not do the trick!
045122499X|4.0|I enjoyed both pillars of the earth and world without end.  However, the author never really gets around to having a defined climax and ending to the story.  5 pages before the ending of the book he is still including plot twists that should have been resolved pages ago.  Each book has the thread of a dark and terrible secret throughout but it is not used.  Rather than making it a central theme which a climax is built upon it is in a tertiary role to come out in the end.  But it doesn't matter, the secret has little to bind it to the story.  Interesting characters, about the same profile in the Pillars of the Earth.  Definitely keeps you reading but the same unsatisfying ending.
0739367676|5.0|I have read all the books in this series and loved them all.  I was curious as to what the audio version would be like.  I am in the car a lot and as reading while driving is a little dangerous... I thought I would give it a try.  I priced this at other stores for around 60.00 and was amazed at how much less it was to purchase from Amazon.  The shipment came fast and I was thrilled at the quality of the readers.  I soon found myself looking for excuses to get back into the car so I could continue the story.  A great purchase!!
0670033049|5.0|I first read \\"East of Eden\\" and three other books by Steinbeck when I was in my twenties. I have to admit that, back then, I wasn't taken with the man and his storytelling. I am now about the age that Steinbeck was when he wrote \\"East of Eden.\\" Today I have enough life experiences under my belt to truly appreciate and hear what the man had to say. Today I have fallen in love with Steinbeck.<br /><br />\\"East of Eden\\" has been reviewed to death over the years, so I will limit my comments to a few special notations that I made. As I read \\"East of Eden\\" it struck me that Steinbeck's background as a journalist and his curiosity about human behavior in general molded him into an excellent armchair psychologist. Indeed in East of Eden, Samuel Hamilton recommends William Jame's voluminous \\"The Principles of Psychology\\" to his son Joe. I also wondered if Steinbeck the journalist \\"borrowed\\" from the Lizzie Borden patricide case as he wrote of the methodical premeditation of Cathy's first murders. Aside from the sociopathic Cathy, Steinbeck's characters impressed me as truly beloved by their author. In fact, Steinbeck seems to me a deep lover of humankind with all of its flaws and struggles. Unlike many authors who seem detached or put off by their own characters, Steinbeck reveals himself as forgiving and understanding of his characters' foibles and craziness. I love him for that.<br /><br />Steinbeck summed up this great story best when Lee tells Samuel: \\"And I here make a rule - a great and lasting story is about everyone or it will not last. The strange and foreign is not interesting - only the deeply personal and familiar.\\" Perhaps that is why I needed to compile that large portfolio of life experiences in order to belatedly fall in love with Steinbeck. And that is no doubt why \\"East of Eden\\" will endure as a great and lasting story.
B0016JYN9S|5.0|This book is frequently cited as influencing ordinary people to get involved in investing in stocks.  Unfortunately, many people misunderstood and thought the bull market would last forever. Insteresting from a historical perspective, but Lynch's advice on stock picking is still valid.
B000PATZQK|5.0|ODYSSEY & ORACLE contains one gem after another.  The only song I had previously heard from this album was the classic \\"Time of the Season\\".  I found out about this album through Pandora, the website that plays you songs or bands that are similar to songs or band that you like.  Thank you, Pandora!  The truly genius song here is \\"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)\\" a haunting anti-war song about WW1.  How is it possible that I have never heard this song?  I find it shocking.  The beautiful and tragic \\"A Rose for Emily\\", inspired by the William Faulkner short story of the same name, is also great.  The other songs crept up on me and embedded themselves in my subconscious - there isn't one I haven't found myself singing.  One of the great albums.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|My kids love this movie!  Its in such great condition!  Should last a very long time!  :)
B00009ZYC1|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. I love this movie ever since it first came out so I decided to order one since my other one got messed up. It's funny and though that my toddler would enjoy it as well.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie was a total surprise to me. I saw it just last night (March 2009). I somehow missed this gem of a movie. I've noticed a lot of viewers criticize the lack of realism of the Gun-Kata, and the premise of the emotions being removed, but I don't see the problem. The movie is clearly a fantasy. Nonetheless, there are some amazing scenes and some great acting in the film. The movie takes its world and characters seriously. That adds a lot of weight to the movie. The gun-kata and other fighting scenes are simply stunning. In fact, I'd say the fighting scenes are beautiful. The movie has many other moments of beauty as well. In particular, I love the scene of Bale running his hands over the contraband, trying to understand his new feelings. I also loved the moment when he tears the blinds off his window to see the world. The scene is obvious, but no less powerful because of it.    Fantastic movie! Amazing. 5 stars.
0061245097|5.0|I love this series. Frost writes things so differently than a lot of the other vamp romance authors, so she really stands out in comparison. The book starts out with Cat longing for Bones years after she walked away from him (believing that was what was best for him to keep him alive). She's been working for an agency that keeps track of vamp violence and activities while running tests and things on the vamps, ever since she left Bones. In the first book, she expects to hate her job, but she's grown to really like it, and become really close to the people she works with.<br /><br />But thankfully, Bones does come back. And Cat realizes that Bones never forgot about her, just like she never forgot about him. But her life is on the line when she finds out that a vamp master is after her to make her his own. This master turns out to be Bones' sire and one of his best friends. And in order to save Cat from this fate, Bones must find a way to break his ties to his sire to claim Cat as his own.<br /><br />Frost is a brilliant writer. There were so many twists to this story. Things that happened were so unexpected and shocking, but they were perfect! I loved the first book, but this one was much better. Frost has created an excellent heroine. And Cat's inner ramblings are something that definately make the reader laugh out loud. Bone is the perfect character to go along with Cat. She can be very down on herself sometimes, especially when it comes to her half-vamp, half-human issues. And Bones is always there for her, telling her exactly what she needs to hear.<br /><br />I'll anxiously be awaiting the 4th book to the series!
0385340567|1.0|There is so much wrong with \\"Nothing to Lose,\\" that it is difficult to know where to begin.  Setting aside Child's ideology, the plot is simply devoid of any sense.  Throughout the entire book, Jack Reacher spends most of his time spying on people and generally poking around for information keeping his reader more in the dark than even he is. Back and forth he goes from one town to another. Do we ever really find out why he is so unwelcomed in the town of Despair? Not really.  Is this new villian anywhere near Child's past villians? Hardly. Yet,when the timing is right, Reacher gets to slam America's Rehabilitation hospitals, Christians, and the Iraq war. It is almost as if he wrote this weak, semi-plotted tale which enables him to get MUCH off his chest.  There will be some who agree with Child's sentiments on these issues, but that is beside the point.  The book is plain boring, and making Jack Reacher the spokesman for Child's venting is simply ridiculous.     I can only hope that the tantrum is over for now and Lee Child will get back to everyone's favorite hero with a nice, tight suspensful page-turner which we have all come to expect.

B001N26GFC|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />If Debbie Downer were bi-polar, her opposite half might well be peppy \\"Poppy,\\" a perpetually upbeat thirty-year-old elementary school teacher whom no vicissitude of life could ever hope to faze.  Poppy seems utterly impervious to either hard times or bad news as she giggles and chortles her way around London, going to work, hanging out with her buddies, or taking driving lessons from a stuffy, humorless instructor who may be developing a more-than-professional interest in his client.<br /><br />In terms of structure, Mike Leigh's \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" has an aimlessness and a formlessness that is both the movie's greatest asset and its most problematic weakness.  This approach does make the story feel less contrived and more realistic, but it also robs the movie of some of the cohesion, drama and emotional power it might have had had it been more formally designed.<br /><br />In a similar way, Sally Hawkins has been assigned the extraordinarily challenging task of bringing an aura of likeability to a character who, if you met her in real life, would probably drive you straight over the edge after a mere five minutes in her presence.  Luckily, Hawkins is largely successful in toning down at least some of Poppy`s more egregiously irritating mannerisms, and in the rare moments when the character is allowed to actually behave like an honest-to-God grownup woman, Hawkins wins us over completely.  Eddie Marsan also scores big as the rage-filled, uptight driving instructor who, in a wonderfully explosive scene that is the verbal equivalent of a slap in the face, finally confronts Poppy with a few unattractive truths about herself.<br /><br />It's nice to come across a character who isn't all depressed and angst-ridden about life for a change, and Poppy certainly seems to have found a niche in the world that works for her.  That's a rare enough thing in movies these days to make \\"Happy-Go-Lucky,\\" flaws and all, worth checking out.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|SPOILER ALERT:  First off I watched this with english dubbing, and the actors voices were horrible, so maybe if I had watched it with subtiltes, I may have raised my 3 star rating.   I read many reviews that were 5 star, so maybe I was expecting more from it.  The idea is awesome: what appears to be serial killer murders, a 12 year old vampire girl, a 12 year old mortal boy who is being bullied, and falls for the girl, a snowy backdrop, etc.  BUT, for me some questions:  WHY was the boy beautiful and the girl homely?  WHY was there not a single cop, investigator, etc, on the scene in any of the murders?   (a drained body in the woods,  body frozen in the lake, a woman who burst into flames in a hospital, a man who put acid on his face, and while in the hospital gets pushed out the window and onto the ground several stories below, and 3 or 4 mutilated kids bodies at a wmca)  WHY was there no sense of fear in the town, or the hospital?  WHY was there one scene in the middle of the movie that had NO snow at all, when every other scene had \\"2 feet\\" according to reports, and another 2 feet on the way?  HOW did the boy get away from the wmca scene at the end with the girl in a box no less?  I still liked the \\"feel\\" of it.  I am still waiting for that GREAT vampire movie.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|\\"Elizabeth,\\" the first film, was about a young woman coming to the throne in a period of great turmoil, and how she dealt with that... It was love in the context of power, betrayal, and survival...<br /><br />In \\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\\" we're dealing with the most famous aspects of her regime, the Spanish Armada, the Babington Plot, which was a major plot against her, and Walter Raleigh bringing back the very early understanding of the New World, and the horizons beyond Britain... It is the exploration of unrestricted power...<br /><br />Elizabeth, as cultured and as intelligent and eloquent as she was, had never left the shores of England... And into her court, strides an explorer who has literally been where the maps end... The gallant Raleigh (Clive Owen) was a free spirit who thrills the queen with his tales and discoveries at sea ... The classic 16th-century adventurer who doesn't play by any official rules, and he does bring into the world of the court something very alluring, enigmatic and charismatic, which has a big impact on the queen...<br /><br />The relationship between Raleigh and Elizabeth was very complicated... There were things holding Elizabeth back... \\"We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love.\\" These words were spoken by Sir Walter Raleigh to the Virgin Quenn...It's very rare that the Queen takes interest in a man, and she does...<br /><br />At this special point, England was very weak militarily... Elizabeth had discharged the navy... And once again it was the old problem of religious instability, which harasses the human race frequently...<br /><br />Anybody that's interested in this period of history will find it fascinating just how capable Elizabeth was in regards to how she dealt with the captive Queen of Scots...<br /><br />Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) had great respect for the Protestant Elizabeth, and was remarkably intrigued by her, and desperate to meet her, and fascinated... For several years Elizabeth suffered about her execution because she really believed two things... She believed that any queen was divine... She accepted as true that her Catholic cousin was there by the will of God, and therefore, Mary was there by the will of God... And in executing Mary, she would disintegrate her one belief that she herself was divine...<br /><br />Mary found it in death... Elizabeth had to find it in life... So if you look at the Armada, Elizabeth finally does become divine, and that's why we had to admire how the scene of the Armada is shot, by Shekhar Kapur, in that way... It's not actually a fiery sea battle between two countries... It's a 'Holy War' with Spain... Therefore, the defining moments of the Armada is when Elizabeth walks up across the verdant cliffs in flowing white nightgown... She's no longer the Avenging Queen... She's instead a supernatural being, a disembodied soul defeating the enemy, dominating the fearless of the waves, the force of the storm, and the strength of fire...<br /><br />Dripping with intrigues, plots, battles, mysteries, and strong emotions, the film captured the ecclesiastical spaces of the cathedrals to look more like a palace environment... It also captured the feel of the16th century architecture, linking and matching it to the proper locations...lizabeth suffered about her execution because she really believed two things...

B001N26GFM|5.0|Prepare yourself: you will need tissues for this one.  This is a Holocaust movie with sufficient realism to remind the viewer that this horror did in fact happen.  Definitely NOT a movie for the younger kids.      This film took the various views of the Holocaust during that time. It is through an eight-year-old boy, Bruno, that we see events unfold. Bruno's father, Ralf, is a Nazi soldier, a highly ranked one at that.  Bruno's grandfather is proud of his son's position in the German military, convinced that his son is \\"making history.\\"  Bruno's grandmother is a German citizen who opposes Hitler's views, much to the chagrin of her own son.  And Bruno's mother is a society wife, who at the beginning of the film is concerned only with her own family and their secular German life.  At the beginning, you see these four points of view and how sheltered Bruno has been -- politics isn't discussed in front of the children, so Bruno and his older sister Gretel have a cheerfully ignorant childhood.      When Ralf is promoted, he brings his wife and children away from Berlin  to a \\"house in the country.\\" Bruno hates this move until he peeks out of the window and discovers a \\"farm\\" a ways away.  He wonders aloud why the farmers wear their pajamas all day long.  Bruno's questions are ignored.  He asks his father what the funny smell is coming from the chimneys far away ... and his father dismisses it gruffly, saying, \\"They burn rubbish over there.\\"  Bruno wonders how the nice man -- Pavel -- who peels potatoes knew how to treat his wound after a bad fall.  Pavel tells him that he \\"used to practice as a doctor before ... coming here.\\"  Pavel doesn't tell the young boy what is going on, that he's Jewish ... or that the \\"farm\\" is really a concentration camp.    An exploring Bruno discovers a boy named Shmuel (pronounced \\"Shmall\\") who's his exact age, sitting on the \\"farm\\"/camp side of a barbed wire fence in striped pajamas. When Bruno asks his new friend why he's wearing pajamas with numbers, if it's part of a game, he is quickly informed that soldiers took his other clothes away and that it is not a game.  \\"I don't much care for soldiers, do you?\\" Shmuel asks.  Bruno tells him, \\"I do.  My father's a soldier -- but not the kind that takes people's clothes away.\\"  Bruno asks why there is barbed wire, wondering aloud if it's to keep animals from getting out.  Shmuel explains that it's to keep people from getting out.  When Bruno presses the matter, his friend explains just why -- Shmuel is a Jew.     Bruno and Shmuel become good friends, despite their different backgrounds and situations.  In one critical moment, he makes a mistake he immediately regrets and seeks to correct it somehow for his friend.  For Shmuel, he will right the wrong ... no matter what.  Without hesitation, the boys make a pact ... one made in innocence and friendship. The two young actors that played Bruno and Shmuel were great, both with expressive eyes and good delivery on every line.  David Thewlis (Lupin from the \\"Harry Potter\\" films) is excellent as Bruno's father in this movie, especially in the movie's poignant final scenes ... a great job in a very complicated role.      At the end, my jaw dropped and I had tears in my eyes.  I doubt I would add this to my own collection (I borrowed this), but I can say that I do not regret seeing it.  The ending is both staggering and chilling, the final shot of the film is poignant in its realism.   If you appreciated Schindler's List for its historical relevance, then you would also appreciate this movie.

031606792X|5.0|As with all her books, including the Host, I just couldn't put it down. She captures emotion well and I can picture the scenes in my head as I read. Don't read this one without reading the previous ones in the series. Believe me it's worth your time. I read all four in 1 week and 2 days and only at night. Yes, it's that type of book.
0385340990|5.0|I have nothing to say except for the fact that the book came quickly and in perfect shape, and I am happy I bought my book this way.
0440244870|3.0|I have to say, I bought this book at the airport just to have something to read on the plane. I wasn't excited about it at all ....   The beginnig was pretty slow, the main character is kind of disturbing ... her spending habits were just not tolerable. The book got better by the end. It was an OK book, overall.

B001GZ6QDS|3.0|Bought it for a firend that is a huge batman fan.  I didn't see the package but saw the movie elsewhere.  Sorry but I didn't like the movie. The special effect were good but the plot wasn't there. My friend thought it was great.
B001MYIXAC|2.0|From the time I first heard of this movie I was sure I would like it and waited eagerly for it to be available. Let me say that I am quite a fan of European films and like Bergman especially. When I finally watched it a couple of days ago, I was very disappointed.  While I thought the cinematography was quite good, the overall film left me bored and unmoved.  I find myself somewhat puzzled by the raves that appear about it here and other places because I feel that it is being extremely over-hyped.  Perhaps if I had watched it before reading all the raves I would have like it (at least a little) more.    For those who read this and plan to watch it, I would advise you to be sure to set up your DVD player to run the audio in the original Swedish with English subtitles.  I accidentally watched the dubbed version and, I must say it was one of the most horrible examples of dubbing that I have ever witnessed.
B001PA65VC|2.0|It's truly a sad day when I have to write a review and say that a Prodigy album is a disappointment, but this one, with the exception of maybe two of the tracks, is a complete turn for the worst.    Anyone that has been listening to Prodigy for over 10 years will tell the negative downturn in their sound. AONO was a nice sort of fusion come-back album, merging their Fat-of-the-land feel with more modern synthy sounds, but 'Invaders must die' takes that to a ridiculous level.    The fact I was always proudest of about Prodigy and that really kept me listening over the years, was the fact that they had truly managed to have a unique style in electronica, which is pretty hard to do with the multitude of electronica artists out there over the years. This album, unfortunately, in my view takes to a road that will only merge them into a soup of synty-electro-trancy-pop artists.    More so, in most of their past albums there was a lot greater variety in the sounds of the tracks, each one seemend to approach different bass lines and different stuff, while Invaders seems like it's all a synthy soup with little sense.    The fat vocals from past albums are almost entirely gone too, which is only another minus.    A turn is a turn is a turn, but a turn for the worse isn't one that should be taken.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|I don't normally do this but hopefully it will save someone some time and money.  In my humble opinion this is one of the most disappointing westerns I have ever seen. The first time you hear a gun shot, you will know the quality of the whole movie. It sounds like cap guns going off. The story would be fine if it wasn't for the acting. I don't mean the actors, just their performances. It is way below what they are capable of. If this is Ed Harris' first shot at directing, he should stick to his acting. After all the great movies these actors have performed in, this one should never have been released. I gave my DVD away right after watching it. What a waste of money.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|After seeing it on the stage and twice at the theator I thought it was great.  I pre-order the DVD and it got to the house a day before it's release.

Here we are over a month later and STILL NO THE DEPARTED!!! I know I didn't pay much for the dvd, but I DID PAY FOR IT! All I want is what I ordered. The only thing that gets under my skin about this is the fact that out of all 3 dvds I ordered I looked forward to getting this one the most..... GO FIGURE!!
B000005HFH|5.0|The Best of Chet Baker Sings is an excellent CD by a man who was exceptionally talented, Chet Baker. Chet could sing and play the trumpet faultlessly; and the hint of vulnerability in his voice no doubt endeared him to his audiences. This CD has quite a few tracks on it; and the quality of the sound is excellent. The artwork is nicely done as well.<br /><br />\\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" has Chet singing wonderfully; he sings this wearing his heart on his sleeve and I'm impressed. This song about the ending of a love affair is a strong beginning for this album. \\"But Not For Me\\" is a tune I've heard so many times before; and Chet's rendition ranks high. That elegant percussion enhances this jazzy rendition of \\"But Not For Me;\\" and it all holds its own very well. \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes)\\" features Chet's vocals front and center--which is fine by me! Chet's excellent diction enhances his performance even more. In addition, I especially like \\"My Funny Valentine;\\" \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is clearly a major highlight of this album. I could never tire of hearing the great Chet Baker perform this song; he does it with so much passion I believe he's really singing from the bottom of his heart based on his own experience.<br /><br />\\"Just Friends\\" begins with quite a short but sweet jazzy horn arrangement; and when they stop and this number starts in for real the key modulations sound just right as Chet sings this without a hitch. The minor keys in particular make this work so well--and how's about Chet's trumpet playing? He was quite the master. \\"I Remember You\\" has Chet singing some rarely heard opening lyrics to this classic pop tune; the piano playing adds elegance to this tune and \\"I Remember You\\" gets quite a special jazzy arrangement as well. It's heaven, man!<br /><br />\\"Let's Get Lost\\" shines bright as Chet and the gang perform this with a jazzy twist; and I always enjoy \\"That Old Feeling\\" when Chet Baker and these musicians play it. \\"That Old Feeling\\" is an older tune about love but when these guys perform it the tune sounds fresh and new--Chet and his mates were all THAT good.<br /><br />\\"My Buddy\\" has more terrific trumpet playing; and listen for \\"Like Someone In Love\\" which gets quite an unusual arrangement--but it works well; just listen! The album also ends well with Chet Baker performing \\"My Ideal.\\" \\"My Ideal\\" features Chet squarely front and center--right where he belongs even to this day.<br /><br />Chet Baker's talents come across so clearly when you hear this album; it's perfect for his fans and people just getting to know him as well. This is also a wonderful album for people who enjoy jazzy versions of classic pop vocals.<br /><br />Thank you so much, Chet! Great job, everyone!bout love but when these guys perform it the tune sounds fresh and new--Chet and his mates were all THAT good.     \\"My Buddy\\" has more terrific trumpet playing; and listen for \\"Like Someone In Love\\" which gets quite an unusual arrangement--but it works well; just listen!

B001NB1ONC|2.0|When Amazon recently offered this album as a $1.99 download deal, I figured that wasn't too much to lose to see if I had mistakenly rejected this album as drivel 30 years ago. I don't know - maybe after another 30 years I'll finally hear what those who really like this album are hearing. But for now, this album still seems mostly boring to me. I'm sure the music is technically brilliant, but I can't emotionally connect to most of it.
B001EVPBY4|5.0|I can't really add anything to what the other reviewers have said, except to echo their praise! If you liked Lazar's production of \\"Sant'Alessio\\", also available on DVD, then you'll love this one.<br /><br />A little warning about the subtitles: they might not work on older DVD players. I couldn't get any subtitles, in any language, to display on a circa 2000 player, but they worked fine on brand-new equipment. I know someone else has had the same problem, so I don't think it was simply a defect of my own copy.
0131103628|5.0|Everything has already been said about this book. I just would like to add the importance of understanding C programming. In the beginning its painful but it teaches check and understand the code you write. There is so many languages out there and they all seem to get further and further away from the machine. In most cases there is nothing wrong with that, but if your a CS student or want to learn programming this is a great place to start. I'm in no way a expert of C but it has forced me to stop and think about what is happening in the background. As a full time C# and SharePoint Developer its great to appreciate where all these high level languages come from. In no way am I saying C is for everyone. Read the book, write 12 applications, fix errors, read the book again and keep it close.<br /><br />Overall the book is very well written and on my top 10 books besides Code Complete 2.<br /><br />Carl
0618918248|5.0|If you're not an atheist already, this book is intended for you to become one. I've read that some religious people are scared to read this book because it really does challenge their beliefs in a deity.    Richard Dawkins comes with what some might think as witty or even harsh in a way with his attacks on religion or God in this book. Dawkins brings forth the highly improbably reasoning there is no supreme being floating in the sky above us, watching us, our every move and thought.    This book brings some new insights and defends evolution at it's best. It is an attack on religion and the faulty logic behind it all. Read it at your own risk if you are religious, you might just come out as an atheist after reading the God Delusion or maybe at least leaning towards agnosticism. Be prepared to think about what you believe in with an open mind but not forgetting that you can in fact lead a happy, normal life without worshiping some evil, jealous, arrogant deity.
B000WS4P5G|4.0|Elvis lives... he sold his soul to Satan and is now known as Danzig! What a classic gem this CD is, right from the first song it grabs you by the throat with a 1-2 combo of hooks and riffs. This ain't your modern day screaming metal (which I happen to enjoy very much), this guy actually sings and sings pretty good. He sounds like Elvis and Danny Joe Brown (Molly Hatchet) and that other guy, what's his name? Oh yeah Lucifer. Great classic metal from back in the day.
B000O599WG|4.0|The movie looks like Howard Hawks was doing a pilot for a TV Western during the \\"golden age\\" of TV westerns like Gunsmoke and The Rifleman. It looks shot on some CBS soundstage. Ironically, I believe Walter Brennan had the most TV experience on the shoot and he comes across as the most cinematic character in the movie.
B00007BK2N|1.0|* pseudo-spoilers below *    Like others here, not only am I a big JD and NO fan, but also a fan of the clubbing scene and an a person who gets into the cool stuff like the Factory Records numbering system (even Tony Wilson's casket had one apparently).    This was a film about Tony Wilson more than anything, and was poorly done from even that point. I think the producers were trying to capture the angst and magic of the history of Factory and the Hacienda, but they missed it. Coogan is way too dry, the cinematography is not compelling, the storyline is incredibly random and jumpy. If you were not already familiar with some of the storylines you would be completely lost as to what was going on, and if you are familiar you would be disappointed. There are also way too many unnecessary scenes included- the pigeons, the UFOs, seeing God, hang-gliding, etc. which don't add anything and just make the film drag on.    It is a shame, cause it is great story, and some of the other characters have a lot more character (no pun intended), but don't get the chance to offer it to the viewer.
B000068CNX|5.0|I always enjoy sitting at home watching a batch of \\"Friends\\" and now I can do it in my spare time. I think the second season is a great season to watch and encourage anyone who is considering this product should get their hands on it
B000002UB2|1.0|This review is for the vinyl release and its quality, not for the album itself.   This record was mastered from the 1987 CD, meaning that the warmth and depth normally associated with a direct analog transfer from the master tapes to vinyl is completely missing, not to mention the fact that the '87 CD's were mastered from 2nd and sometimes 3rd generation tapes of the master, resulting in a muffled high end, buried drums, and too much bass.    If you're looking for a vinyl copy with good sound quality, you're better off hunting for one of the repressings from the 70's or 80's (these are distinguished by not having a UPC barcode on the back of the jacket), or, if you have the pocketbook, a copy of the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs vinyl release. However, if your sound system is lo-fi, and you're not picky about sound quality, then you won't mind the points I described above.   Hopefully one of these years, Capitol/Parlophone/Apple will remaster The Beatles' catalog properly, instead of letting the fans line the pockets of used record sellers.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|In addition to the practical audio commentary by John Carpenter, there's also a generous amount of fun making-of features and documentaries on the DVD including production sketches and script-to-storyboard comparisons. But the real bonus here is you get to hear from executive producer/screenwriter Deborah Hill on the commentary track. On the audio track, she shares all the ups and downs with this follow-up production and how they were successfully pressured by the studio to tweak its classic, mannered tone by filming new gory scenes for an audience that supposedly wanted more blood and violence. Carpenter was nothing if not generous.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I am writing this review on Oscar Nomination morning (although due to the fact that I refuse to post a review until the DVD has dropped you will be reading this much later) mostly due to my elation that it has been nominated for not only the marvelous performance by Kate Winslet (in the right category mind you) but also for Best Picture, Best Director and Adapted Screenplay.  I've been chomping at the bit to write this review ever since I walked out of the theater a few weeks back, and since then I've seen the film a record three times and I would watch it again right now if I could.  I've pondered this film, discussed this film, relived this film and can honestly label it the best film of the year and quite possibly one of the best films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />Sure, you can be quick to pinpoint it's supposed faults, and you can try and label it something that it is not, but if you allow your eyes to open and your mind to absorb you may be able to see this for what it really is; a masterpiece.<br /><br />When sitting down to write this review I asked my friend how I was going to be able to do so without being redundant or irritating.  I mean, how many different ways can you say masterpiece before someone says \\"I get the point, now move on\\"?  I'm going to try and get all that out of the way right now so that my review will be palatable.<br /><br />`The Reader' is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Okay, I'm done now.<br /><br />Having read Bernhard Schlink's beautiful novel I was really anticipating this film.  I feel that Kate Winslet is the finest working actress today and this just seemed like such an ideal role for her (Oscar, if you pass her over this year I vow to never watch another telecast).  I of course try and shrug off all `high expectations', and thankfully with `The Reader' there was no hype.  It hasn't been hailed as the best of anything, and while it has landed on a few top ten lists it rarely breaks close to the top.  The reviews have been mixed, some raving it as a masterpiece, some labeling it a faux; an imitation of a more insightful film.  The only awards the film has garnered up until the point have been for Winslet so walking into the film, I was not feeding into hype.<br /><br />I was simply hoping to see a good movie.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Michael Berg, a young fifteen year old boy living in Post-WWII Germany.  One day while making his way home he falls ill and is helped back by an older woman named Hanna.  After waiting out his illness he attempts to thank Hanna but he winds up falling into a steamy affair.  The two bond over books, using reading as a form of foreplay, and the two become almost inseparable.  Then for no apparent reason Hanna leaves town without a word and Michael is left wondering why his only love has left him.  Years later while Michael is attending law school he gets the opportunity to sit in on a trial being held over war crimes and is stunned, and ultimately heartbroken, to see Hanna is one of the accused.<br /><br />First and foremost it should be addressed that this is not your typical Holocaust film, for quite frankly the Holocaust is the least impressionable part of this film.  The film, like the novel, deals strongly with the feelings of guilt and redemption.  There is a moral play that runs throughout each scene that begs the audience to cast judgment, but not in an absolute way but in a more complex and understanding way.  `The Reader' has no easy answers, but it throws at the audience a bit of a conundrum.  It reminds me very much of `Dead Man Walking', a film that appears to have such an easy answer yet causes you to rip apart your own ideals.<br /><br />I am keeping SPOILERS to a minimum here, but be forewarned that there may be a few.<br /><br />When we meet Michael and Hanna they seem like an odd match.  He is obviously better off financially than she is.  He is attending school and is doing rather well.  Hanna is working a dead end job and livingin a small apartment.  Her education is limited but her yearning for more is apparent.  There is an attraction physically, which cannot be denied.  While Hanna is rough due to the nature of her life she is a diamond in the rough, a beautiful woman trapped within the shell of her former life.  Michael is young and coming into his own; a handsome boy with a head on his shoulders.<br /><br />There's innocence within him that Hanna desires.<br /><br />Their relationship is very fast and very graphic, but there is a sincerity there that one needs to truly look for.  Some have complained that the relationship was pure surface; nothing but lust.  They are missing something crucial.  `The Reader' is a film filled with quiet moments that speak volumes about the characters.  There is a deeper connection between these two souls, one that maybe they can't even recognize.  There is a moment where Hanna finds herself inside a small church listening to a young choir and the tears are streaming down her face, and as Michael watches her from the doorway we can see it; even if he or even she doesn't truly understand it.<br /><br />It is there.<br /><br />As the film progresses and the two are separated we begin to truly see the deeper connection that they are feeling for the first time.  As the trial proceeds Michael is caught between his own feelings of right and wrong; between what is ethical and what is not.  He is disturbed by the revelations concerning his former love; distraught over what this means for him and whether or not it had anything to do with his personal attachment to this woman.<br /><br />Can he bring himself to hate her?  Can he bring himself to forgive her?  Does she deserve that hatred or that forgiveness?<br /><br />There is a moment when Michael is attempting to visit Hanna in prison when everything makes sense; his eyes swelling with an emotion he has yet to fully realize.  He struggles to convince himself that he hates this woman, because hating her would make it easier to forget her.<br /><br />`The Reader' is a masterfully crafted tale of love and loss; of what we tell ourselves in order to better understand something we haven't the capacity to grasp.  There is the shame in Hanna's eyes as she hides her secret (one that you no doubt had guessed long before it was revealed, but the revealing of the secret is not really the point of the story), willing to sacrifice her very life so as not to be downgraded or looked down on.  There is the guilt in Michael's eyes as he blames himself for Hanna's fate, unable to step outside his skin long enough to decide the correct course to case.  This is a story about mistakes and missteps and regrets and the ultimate loss that comes from not fully understanding how to feel.<br /><br />Technically, this is a flawless film.  I remember reviewing `...Jesse James...' last year (this site still won't let me type in that full name) and going on and on about how technically perfect it was, from the cinematography to the score to the lighting to the mood to just about everything.  `The Reader' is the exact opposite in scope yet just as profound.  It is a much subtler film, and so the score, the lighting, the cinematography and the set designs are smaller, yet just as pristine.  Everything is so crisp and delicate; adding layers to the mood perfectly presented by director Stephen Daldry.  I was a little hesitant about Daldry's ability to transfer Schlink's novel to the big screen.  I loved `Billy Elliott' and continue to love it more and more every time I watch it, but Daldry's latest effort was that 2002 debacle `The Hours' and so I was truly afraid that he was going to run the same gamut and deliver a similar piece.<br /><br />`The Reader' is not only much more profound and poignant, but it is also executed much better than `The Hours' (to be fair, I need to watch this movie again, but I was not impressed the first or second go around).<br /><br />When it all boils down to it though, thismovie is all about two things; Kate Winslet and David Kross.  Both actors deliver career highs (and to say that about Winslet is saying a lot since she is always top notch).  Their performances are truly organic.  That has become my new favorite word this year, for I feel as though it truly taps into the depth of these performances.  There is a naturalness that fortifies itself within these performances, deepening with each flicker in the eyes or twitch under the skin.  Try your hardest to watch Winslet's face (I know it's hard, especially since she is without clothing for practically the whole first hour of the film).  There is a scene where she is lying in the bathtub and Kross comes in to hash out their argument.  As he speaks you can see for the first time her hard exterior melting away and revealing this woman that she doesn't even know exists.  It is so subtle yet so profound.<br /><br />Winslet is utter perfection.<br /><br />Kross is just as superb, sinking into his character and delving deep into his emotional responses to his current situation.  The scene in the courtroom (all of the courtroom scenes are beyond breathtaking) when he notices Hanna for the first time is utterly immobilized.  Watch as Kross exhibits such a natural gut reaction; as controlled as he can be yet giving way to lapses of uncontrollability.<br /><br />The supporting cast is also superb, from Fiennes' dynamic understanding of Michael's emotional regression to Bruno Ganz's grasp of the real situation at hand.  The one standout here is truly Olin, who proves to be one of the most important facets of the film.  Her final scene with Fiennes is what makes the movie work, dispelling any easy sympathies for Hanna's atrocities with her cold standing.  For anyone who has complained (and there have been many) that this film tries to condone the actions taken by Hanna I urge you to rewatch and study this scene, for in a few short words Hanna's actions are condemned wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Remember, it is not her actions that we are sympathizing with, it is her inner person; cold and rigged yet incomplete, pleading for something or someone to make her feel whole.<br /><br />Thanks in large part to David Hare's marvelous adaptation, `The Reader' lives up to its source material and delivers a truly outstanding and utterly astounding look at this tragic yet beautiful love story.  If you walk away from `The Reader' unmoved then maybe you are just plain unmovable.<br /><br />I'll close by saying that the Oscar's have passed, Kate won the gold (YES!!!) and I still agree wholeheartedly with every word in this review.in order to better understand something we haven't the capacity to grasp.

B001KMB6X2|4.0|I originally saw this movie in theaters because it was a sci-fi flick, and as a casual writer of science fiction, I tend to like to go see sci-fi movies.  I can understand the people's reviews here that scored it lower if the only version they watched was the theatrical release, because I walked out of the movie hall with mixed feelings about it.  I've never read the novel \\"Babylon Babies\\" that it's based on, so I tried to judge the movie on its own merits.  The movie was dark.  It was gritty.  It was cyberpunk in a style that some would say is dead.  That was decent enough.  But you could tell that the main purpose of the original version was as a build-up to the sequel that Twentieth Century Fox studios fairly screamed they were going to make at the end.  The theatrical version was clearly designed as a pilot to a franchise.  It had some good action scenes with well-designed special effects, but as a whole, it ended up being rather disjointed.  It went from one action shot to the next with only minimal connection between the characters and I ended up not identifying with anything.  It was almost as if Fox expected you to go \\"Gosh, wow!\\" in a mindless fashion every time you saw something explode on screen and come out saying \\"AWESOME movie, man!!\\" with a little bit of drool hanging out of the corner of your mouth.  So, if the original version was the only one I had to look forward to coming out on DVD, I would have to give it a rating of 2 1/2 stars, with 3 stars if I was feeling generous.<br /><br />The unrated, extended cut changed all that, and that was all due to the extra footage and the alternate ending.  This cut delved deeper into the characters, both pro- and antagonistic, gave them more reason as to why they acted the way they did (especially why Vin Diesel's character 'Toorop' was as hard-bitten as he was, showing him as a small child of about 6 or 7 years old in one of the recall scenes surrounded by a group of rough types laughing and cheering as a double-barreled shotgun was placed in his hands).  As a result, the whole of the movie gelled together much more effectively into a personal, more human-oriented story.  The ending of the alternate cut also allowed the movie to stand on its own merits.  You knew there was a sequel coming up, but it was more subtle.  I almost think Fox shot themselves in the foot by releasing the alternate cut because if people identify more with this version than the original, the studio is going to have a tough time coming out with just another action slug-fest in a way that people can connect the two together, when and if the studio does a sequel.<br /><br />A lot of people gave this movie low marks simply because Vin Diesel was in it.  I have a feeling that if a current golden child of the industry had been cast in the role of the lead instead, it would have done much better, both at the box office and in home viewing.  People seem to forget that Vin was thought of as the bomb (wow, a muscle dude that can actually act; take THAT Schwarzenegger!) until he opted out of doing the sequel to the Fast and the Furious.  How DARE he?!  Suddenly, general consensus was that everyone hated him.  Fickle...  Also, a few people make the claim that he's the same character in all of his movies.  I offer that he does a good job with the parts he's given.  It's hard to avoid type-casting in Hollywood.  Look at Will Smith.  He does fabulous in his shows, but those parts are picked especially for him, and he ends up being recognizable as Will Smith, not the character he's supposed to be, except in the movie masterpiece 'Ali' (he WAS Ali in the show).  This is not entirely Hollywood's fault.  People have certain pre-conceived notions going into a movie and are offended when those expectations are not met.  The Hollywood studios have a feel for public mindset and are willing to feed off of that to get the highest dollar.  I put if forth to all of you to have an open mind when watching this and other movies.  Try it.  You might like it.<br /><br />I also gave this movie good marks because it boldly takes up a stance against, and sets itself up for attack from, rigid religious views.  Understand, I have absolutely no problem with religion or faith, as long as the core tenets of that faith espouse kindness, compassion and respect.  My parents are devout catholics, and they are GOOD people, not just because they say God tells them to be, but because they feel it's the right thing to do.  One of my cousins and her husband pray regularly at a small buddhist shrine they have set up in their living room.  They leave their door unlocked and say that if anyone comes in from off the street and needs their help, they've got it.  I'm a tried and true atheist (I just can't believe that humanity's special enough to have been created by some supreme entity, in his or her or its own image no less, and then given the entire universe as our playground until the end times come when the faithful receive eternal bliss as a reward) but I am firmly convinced that I act in a more Christian manner than about 95% of the so-called Christians out there.  I'm 39 now, and in that time, I've met a LOT of religious people who were flat-out jerks.  This movie shows that religion can also have a dark side to it and it challenges religion to step up and take accountability for its member's actions and the tenets it teaches.<br /><br />Also, some people might be offended at the idea of genetically engineered children, bred for a specific purpose or niche.  I remind everyone that nature has been doing this for uncounted millions of years (unless you're a Creationist, then the universe and everything in it is only about 6000 years old).  That's why we have black people, white people, oriental people, latino people and all the other subtypes therein (but, you know what; we can all have children together and that says we're all the same, with about one-tenth of one percent genetic difference MAX between yourself and anyone else you're staring at at the moment).  Nature directs itself to find the most suitable form for a specific environment, so the idea that we're on the verge of technologically taking charge of our own genetic paths is a reality that's closer than we might think (roughly about 25 to 50 years away).  This movie takes that particular bull by the horns as well.  Kudos, Babylon!<br /><br />All in all, this movie-the unrated extended cut especially-was an enjoyable romp around the world for anyone who's brave enough to gaze at how it might be a few years from now.

B000CNFC76|5.0|This movie awakens the slumbering soul, heats up the hungry heart and leaves you teary-eyed at the end. It's a story so powerful, so moving, so magnificent that you have to wonder who imagined it - except it's true!<br /><br />I have learned lately to view movies with what God might have in mind for me in experiencing them, and with \\"Greatest Game\\" the first thing that came to mind was the reminder to fight for your dreams. To embrace the gifts God has given me and realize it will be a fight to reach them. And as so often is the case the people who are supposed to be closest to us, with Francis Ouimet it is his own father that wounds his heart and spirit in deep and significant ways. The Father Wound is a huge part of this story, along with class wars, and you can't help but feel moved by Harry Vardon and Francis' ability to overcome the social stigmas of not being born into the right class of society and always being treated as second class by the \\"gentlemen\\" of their day.<br /><br />The movie is fast-paced, the golf action and special effects fantastic, and like any good sports movie you are captured by the characters and the glory of the game itself. There's also a nice blend of humor and wisdom mixed in at just the right moments.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie - fantastic is the only word that comes to mind.

0743297334|5.0|Ernest Hemingway's classic novel explores the dissipated lives of expatriates in Europe in the years following WWI, most notably the ill-fated pair of Jake Barnes, who suffers from an emasculating war wound, and Lady Brett Ashley, the beautiful woman who entrances every man she meets but shares emotional intimacy only with Jake.    We are treated to the café lifestyle of the Lost Generation in Paris, followed by a trip to Pamplona to witness the running of the bulls, all of it liberally lubricated by alcohol.  But despite the nearly non-stop pleasure-seeking, there is very little joy for the characters in this book.  It all has the feel of a party that has gone on too long; the party-goers become irritated with each other because they should have all gone back to their \\"real\\" lives long ago.  Unfortunately, they are not sure what their real lives should consist of, so they grasp at temporary relationships that always end badly, leaving them ever more jaded and unsatisfied.  This is dramatized powerfully by the cloud of men buzzing around the lovely and charming Brett, who abandons each in turn when the threat of physical and emotional intimacy becomes too great.  It is Jake's inability to perform the physical act of love that enables their extended emotional connection, making him the person she turns to after each failed affair.  I suspect that if Jake were not wounded as he is, she would flee from him as well, and the final paragraphs of the novel make it clear that Jake thinks so, too.    If there are few pleasures for the characters, there are many for the reader.  In addition to Hemingway's masterful depiction of character, the novel works as a travelogue, particularly in his wonderful evocation of Spain.  This novel is rightly considered to be a classic.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|The film based on John Patrick Shanley's play is superbly done. The actors are in top form with Meryl Streep and Seymour Hoffman demonstrating consider acting force as a nun and a priest in a struggle for competing versions of reality. It is basically about the quest for truth in a world of incomplete clues and hints. The search for truth may lead to a broad range of consequences depending on whose truth is accepted and whose truth is rejected. Sister Aloysius, the Catholic school principal, played by Meryl Streep, is convinced that she has discovered a truth about Father Brendan Flynn, a robust likable assertive priest, played by Seymour Hoffman.     A great strength of the films script is that Shanley leaves the mystery somewhat unresolved in the screen play. Though some film viewers may have concluded that Father Flynn did have some improper behavior with a student, there is still much room for doubt since Father Muller could have been transferred to another Catholic parish to avoid Sister Aloysius' continued assault on his reputation and his peace of mind.    The film begins with the central theme of the play, as given in a sermon by Father Flynn. He states: \\"What do you do when you are not sure?\\"  The play cascades from this point with Sister Aloysius convinced of Father Flynn's guilt and Sister James wracked with moral uncertainty as to what is true or not true and what are the moral consequences for each decision.    Each clue in the film propels you toward one solution until you are given another clue drawing you in the opposite direction and conclusion. In this way, Sister James acts as the viewer and she voices some of the same trusts and doubts that must be in the mind of every viewer of the film. Some viewers of the film will not rush to judgment and will absorb the subtle clues that propel this clash of characters forward.  Other viewers of the film will take sides since Father Flynn is a likeable, robust, assertive, clever, strong, person who is contrasted with the cold rock strength and certainty of Sister Aloysius, who is never presented as especially warm or compassionate yet her actions speak to great compassion if indeed she fully believes she is interrupting the sexual predatory actions of Father Flynn.    The film even takes a surprise direction when we hear from Donald Muller's mother who tells us her son is an effeminate child who was been repeatedly beaten in public schools as well as by his father for his effeminate behaviors. In Catholic school, his mother hoped he would be protected. His mother sees the possible attentions of this white priest toward her son as far more desirable than the hostility he experiences from young males in public school or from his own father. The character of Mrs. Muller is unexpected, wonderfully acted, and throws a complete different light onto the actions of the play. Sister Aloysius thought she had found a partner and then found more than for which she had bargained.    The film comes to a resolution, one that I will not reveal and one that not every viewer will like or appreciate. But the human condition requires doubt, and certainty is so rare that we rightfully distrust it, doubt is far more likely to be the fate of human beings.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I went to see this film on a whim. What started out in the first 10 minutes or so as the usual broad Ben Stiller comedy suddenly begin to narrow - right about the point where the 'director' is blown up - until it becomes the most incisive parody of Hollywood action filmmaking that has ever been made. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in a theater. Maybe it helps if, like me, you've worked in the film biz, and have done action films. Robert Downey Jr. and Nick Nolte are superb. Brilliant script. The whole 'Simple Jack' subplot is pure comic genius.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is a young adult novel set in a dystopic future, where there is no more North America--only a place called Panem, with its gorgeous capitol and twelve outlying districts. Back in the day, the districts gathered together and rebelled against the capitol. The capitol defeated them soundly, even oblitering what used to be the 13th district.<br /><br />Now, as part of the peace treaty terms, every year each district must draw the names of one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, to participate in a yearly event called the Hunger Games--a fully televized, commercialized fight to the death held in a massive terrained arena, to see which person will be left standing. That person will be lavished with prized goodies and food, as will their district.<br /><br />The heroine, Katniss, is horrified when her younger sister's name is drawn, so she steps forward to take her place as the female candidate (called \\"tributes\\") from district 12, which hasn't had a winner in thirty years. A skilled hunter used to living off the land, Katniss will use her skills and fight to hopefully survive the Hunger Games.<br /><br />Okay, I admit, the cover didn't do too much for me at first (once you read the story, the symbolism makes perfect sense). I'd actually bought the book a couple of months ago and hadn't cracked it open yet. But I'd heard such praise for this story that I finally couldn't resist and started reading it on Monday night. And once I picked it up, it was magnetic. Compelling. Riveting.<br /><br />Basically, un-put-downable.<br /><br />The author is so deft at weaving a story that doesn't overwhelm you with tedious worldbuilding details or slow pacing, but is still rich and lush in vivid details that suck you in. And the story, the characters--where to start? I'm so tongue-tied, I don't even know how to gush properly. LOL. It's a love story. A mystery. An action tale of survival. A cautionary warning of the effects of war on children, on families.<br /><br />I loved reading about the flawed heroine...she was tangible and fascinating. And the other main character in the story, a guy named Peeta who is the male tribute from district 12, is just as amazingly detailed. He's ambiguous, charming, and so realistic.<br /><br />In the end, the best way to sum up my pleasure with this book is to say I wish I had enough money to buy a copy for everyone I know. This is one that will remain on my keeper shelf.<br /><br />By the way, I'm happy to hear there's a sequel, because it ended with some unresolved issues.

B001N3OCV6|1.0|Really? Really? This has got to be the worst-selected movie soundtrack of all time. The incredible inappropriateness of the placement of these songs in the film just about killed both the movie and the songs for me. I will forever be haunted. It'll be years before I'm able to listen to \\"Hallelujah\\" again without being reminded of an energy-sapping sex scene that was placed apparently to kill all momentum in this film. \\"Sounds of Silence\\" is an inarguably great tune that was turned into a horrible cliché by being clumsily inserted at top volume into a funeral scene. I thought Battlestar Gallactica's use of \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" was sappy, but Watchmen topped it. The inclusion of Philip Glass was bizarre. At least he's done some fantastic scores--but not his piece included on this soundtrack. If you want to get some good Glass action, get the pieces he did for Kundun.    At least they didn't include the hellaciously-overdone \\"99 Luft Ballon\\" on the disc. If you really want some of these tunes, download them. And watch Watchmen with the mute button on.

B001M4YZ90|3.0|Many hail \\"Rocknrolla\\" as the comeback of Guy Ritchie. It is true that the director of \\"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\\" and \\"Snatch,\\" impressive one-two punch in 1998 and 2000, feels more comfortable in this UK gangster film territory. He is more assured as director than in dreadful \\"Swept Away\\" and \\"Revolver.\\" Still, I must add that for all some of its entertaining scenes and largely fine acting, \\"Rocknrolla\\" doesn&t offer anything new to us.    Perhaps it is pointless to describe the story of Guy Ritchie's latest film \\"Rocknrolla.\\" Conventional storytelling is not Guy Ritchie's forte. But anyway, there is a story and that is about a lucrative London real estate deal and the British/Russian gangsters trying to outwit the others. Enter a femme fatale-like accountant, plus a missing drug-addicted rock star with a subplot about good luck painting. Frankly, I couldn't exactly follow the opening sequence where the major characters are introduced, but anyway I could catch up with it by and by.     For his newest film, Guy Ritchie stopped using his once trademark hyperkinetic direction. It works in several scenes, for example, one \\"gentle\\" robbery by a small-time criminal \\"One Two\\" played by Gerald Butler, or the long \\"chase\\" scene involving his character and the Russian mobsters. Tom Wilkinson (hardly recognizable) is effective as the kingpin Lenny Cole and Mark Strong is fantastic as Archie his faithful right-hand man. In fact, they (and Toby Kebbell as Johnny Quid) are more impressive than Gerald Butler though Butler's acting is very good.    \\"Rocknrolla\\" is Guy Ritchie's return to form, but is still a disappointment to me. It is entertaining and it is great to see the actors having fun making this film. but the film lacks something original.

B0012QE4Q2|2.0|The Other Boleyn Girl / B0012QE4Q2<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />In my review of the book this movie is based on, I noted that the book is very bad history, but if you are willing to accept the premise of a \\"Boleyn alternate reality\\", it is not a bad story. Sadly, the movie doesn't even have that in its favor.<br /><br />The timeline is rushed and compressed into a few short years, leaving the viewer disoriented and confused at the blurred pacing. Although I had not thought it possible, Anne has been vilified here even worse than in the novel, and Henry is uncharacteristically physically violent and cruel, apparently so that we could have a violent rape scene presented to us. The rape of Anne is particularly disturbing because the viewer seems to be expected to revel in Anne's \\"comeuppance\\" - apparently her sexual assault is meant to be seen as her fitting punishment for being such a shrew during the first half of the movie. I can think of no other explanation for this gratuitous and violent scene, which almost certainly never happened and was not even featured in the book. The entire feel of the movie from that point onward - rape, madness, (attempted) incest - is quite disturbing. The gross distortion of history in movies is common, but this strange obsession with the most sordid gossip about Anne despite the fact that even the source novel managed a light touch seems to reveal less to us about Anne and more about the screenwriters. (I kept expecting them to accuse Anne of bestiality, too, just to be really thorough.)<br /><br />As far as the acting, Johansson does a good job portraying the Mary Boleyn of the novel, but since Mary serves only as a window through which Anne's actions are observed, she seems criminally wasted in this role. Portman tackles the job of Anne-as-demon-spawn with verve and determination, particularly in the elopement scene. Katherine is played well enough, with the proper amount of stern stubbornness, but Henry seems terribly out of sorts and character - in keeping with the book where Gregory seems unable to see him concretely as much of anything, but rather just a leaf on the wind of the women he surrounds himself with.<br /><br />This movie is closed captioned for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollwith the book where Gregory seems unable to see him concretely as much of anything, but rather just a leaf on the wind of the women he surrounds himself with.

B00005JPY2|4.0|Warning: for those that haven't seen the film or read the graphic novel, spoilers are ahead.<br /><br />Ever since Zack Snyder announced that he was bringing Watchmen to the big screen, I had a great amount of reservations.  Not about the man himself, whose 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead I enjoyed, and whose adaptation of Frank Miller's 300 I thought was stunning, but because of the fact that this is Watchmen for crying out loud.  The most celebrated comic ever crafted was deemed unfilmable for so long, but finally here we are, and what is the verdict on Snyder's take of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' classic?  Mostly positive, but not without its flaws either.  From a visual standpoint, Snyder has nailed the environment of Watchmen, as well as the appearances of the characters that populate the film.  The biggest flaw of the film however lies in its conclusion.  Even though the end result of the comic remains unchanged, changing the cause to being blamed on Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) just doesn't sit right with me.  Maybe it's the fanboy in me, but with the appearance of Ozymandias' (Matthew Goode) genetically altered pet Bubastis, and with no mention of his work on genetics (which plays into his construction and development of the squid-like creature in the comic), doesn't this raise a few moments of confusion, especially for those who never read the comic?  Despite this, the rest of Watchmen has been translated greatly.  While there are some other questionable slight changes as the story develops, the film retains the paranoid and compelling tone of Moore's comic.  Not to mention the perfect casting of Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian, Crudup as Dr. Manhattan, and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl; all of whom are superb.  Also, for a 160-some minute running time, it doesn't feel like it's that long, as you can't help but be glued to the screen from the brilliant title sequence onward.  All in all, Zack Snyder's take on Watchmen isn't without its flaws, but it is a visually stunning comic adaptation that manages to defy nearly everything that was going against it.  It isn't perfect, but it still manages to be something special as well, which is quite an achievement in itself.t its flaws, but it is a visually stunning comic adaptation that manages to defy nearly everything that was going against it.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Writing recently on human conscience, Catholic commentaor Thomas Williams defined our \\"still, small voice\\" as a coach shaping and guiding us toward better decisions and higher ideals. \\"Conscience urges us to climb higher,\\" he writes, \\"according to the gifts received and the real possibility of doing good.\\"<br /><br />Generations met this gift through Carlo Collodi's beloved \\"Pinocchio,\\" a marionette granted the gifts of life by his creator's wish upon a star and conscience through a witty, resilient cricket Walt Disney later named Jiminy. Collodi's serialized story of a toy becoming a boy through following his conscience to unselfishness and bravery, is arguably Disney's (and by extension, film animation's) greatest achievement. It's justifiably celebrated in this new 70th anniversary 2DVD set, with vivid, detailed print and soundtrack and a series of enlightening extras.<br /><br />\\"Pinocchio\\"'s characters and songs have defined Disney's mission (and not just from \\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" being the company unofficial theme  or Jiminy among its many goodwill ambassadors.) When elderly woodcarver Geppetto wishes his wooden toy to become a real boy, a blue fairy grants Pinocchio life and knights Jiminy as his conscience (\\"Give A Little Whistle\\") and companion. Overjoyed, Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school where he's sidetracked by fox and feline villains \\"Honest\\" John and Gideon. They tempt him first with fame (singing, \\"Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee,\\" as they walk him to evil, funny showman Stromboli) then, when he's rescued, by pleasure and destruction to the Coachman's Pleasure Island. There Pinocchio, his Bowery Boy-ish friend Lampwick, and other waywards trash the island and their own lives by \\"behaving like jackasses,\\" in some of Disney's most frightening, moving animation. Throughout, Geppetto (with beloved fish Clio and cat Figaro) searches for his kidnapped son until they battle an angry sea and its most fearsome creature to survive.<br /><br />\\"Pinocchio's\\" legend includes Walt Disney's painstaking commitment to its quality. The results testify it doesn't stem from infamous company salesmanship. Documentaries (including one on the \\"sweatbox\\" where Walt critiqued his animators' daily work) describe how Collodi's often irascible puppet became Disney's lovable child struggling with temptation. Jiminy transforms from the story's moralistic critic into the story's center, friend and coach looking much like his voice (then well-known recording artist Cliff Edwards). Legendary actor Mel Blanc, a 40s superstar for his work on \\"Looney Tunes\\" and Jack Benny's radio show, finds his speaking role reduced to yelps as \\"Honest\\" John's evil sidekick Gideon becomes a Harpo Marx-like comic mute.<br /><br />Purists may argue for the 1940 original's muted tones, but this new DVD presents a deeper, more vivid experience than any in Disney's classics library. Disney used the then-new multi-plane camera to provide near 3-D depth to scenes in the village and in Geppetto's shop (especially in its first scenes). Its color palette seamlessly eases from muted yellows at the sunset cliff scene to brackish seawater as Pinocchio and Jiminy dive to save Geppetto, reaching dangerous, even more detailed scenes seeking mighty whale Monstro. The film and its remastering reward repeated viewings.<br /><br />Pinocchio's extras run from illuminating (\\"making of\\" documentaries, theatrical trailers, missing songs and deleted scenes) to interesting (a charming feature on modern puppetmasters and toymakers, \\"real-life Geppettos\\" ) to disposable (a cute children's puzzle game, Meghan Jette Martin's needless teenpop rendition of \\"When You Wish..\\") But it's Disney's storytelling skill and umatched visual gift which turn Carlo Collodi's moralistic tale of forming conscience into an endearing story of maturity and friendship.

B001LTXH1S|5.0|A brilliant conclusion to an exceptional fantasy trilogy. Not only packed with fast-paced action sequences, but also a brave, beautiful presentation of the power of faith. The ending kept me riveted, and even made me cry for joy and sadness at the same time. By far one of the best endings I have ever read.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|Jason Mraz's 3rd album \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things.\\" Expanded - Edition is simply fabulous. His music and lyrics are like musical fluid bringing gallons of satifaction and joy to all genres of music lovers.   I rate Jason Mraz as the best thing ever happened to the pop music industry since Sting even though their musical styles are vividly different. Listen or watch him perform ' Butterfly' &' The Dynamo of Volition' and you'll know what I mean. You'll find it so difficult not to like them, sing along to them, or dance to them ! His tour in Hong Kong is completely sold out and his music has instantaneously become the sanctuary to the local music industry which has been struggling to find a 'soul' to justify its own existance.     Jason Mraz has an exremely rare musical talent which takes him to be amongst the top ranking male artists in the past 30 years!! He is totally unpretentious and so is his music. No fancy clothes...just a t-shirt and a pair of worn out jeans ...but it's his music which makes him 'look' so cool. You must treat yourselves with a copy of this limited edition - DVD + CD Jason Mraz Album.

B000VWYJ86|2.0|The bourne trilogy seemed to devolve as it went. Bourne Identity was the best, Supremecy was good and Ultimatum disappointed. I look at the direction as the principal flaw in the 3rd film. Jittery hand held camera shots, too many jump cuts too frequently and a ping pong between extreme close ups and long range shots. Whatever happened to setting up a couple cameras at a normal distance to clearly follow the action? Matt Damon was good in the role as was most of the cast, but for me the poor direction really detracted. This isn't a movie I anticipate ever watching again.

B0001CCXZW|3.0|Ok...so I think this show is absolutely adorable. I love the dialog and the story lines are very entertaining. However, I am extremely disturbed by the character Lane. I understand that it must be difficult being raised by strict Korean immigrants, in a lily white/All American type of enviornment. But Jesus, does every episode have to involve her saying something disparaging about her culture. I find myself cringing everytime she makes a \\"Korean joke.\\" It would be nice to see a more balanced Asian-American character who had pride in her culture, and wasn't so easy to fully immerse herself into White American cultural values.
B001TODCII|5.0|Saw this one in the movies and what a great movie!  Granted, this is sensitive subject matter, something that you have been hearing about repeatedly in movies and television specials over the last couple of years.  This movie is about human trafficking--in other words, stealing young girls, rendering them helpless with drugs, and then selling them into prostitution to the highest bidder, usually in a foreign country.<br /><br />With that said, Bryan (Neeson) and former wife Lenore are divorced.  Lenore has remarried a rich businessman.  Bryan and Lenore's daughter Kim is now 17 and lives with Lenore.  Bryan sees Kim when he wants but Lenore is kind of icy toward him, still apparently blaming him for the years he wasn't there for mother and daughter.  As a now retired CIA field operative (apparently well thought of and quite proficient in his job), Bryan wants to get to know his little girl better now.  The movie begins as he reminisces about Kim's 5th birthday and subsequently takes a present to her 17th birthday party at the mansion.<br /><br />In the very beginning, Bryan helps a few of his CIA buddies with a side job as a bodyguard to a singer at a concert and befriends her when he saves her life.  You see Bryan's well choreographed protective moves as he puts down the offender and your confidence level in Bryan's abilities soar.  The singer offers to help Kim get a start singing (if she is as good as Bryan says).  Excited to tell Kim, Bryan is mentally slapped in the face when he finds that Kim wants to meet with him over lunch only to get his signed permission to go to Europe with her girlfriend.  Reluctantly, he agrees to sign and off she goes, with conditions to check in daily on the cell phone Bryan gives her.<br /><br />No sooner does the plane land in Paris, than the girls are greeted by a 2-legged snake who is part of an Albanian trafficking ring.  Peter offers to share a taxi with them (to split the expense).  Finding out where they live, he is able to contact the thugs who show up to grab them.  Kim is talking to her father on the cell when she sees the bad guys grab her girlfriend from a window and it is a chilling moment when Bryan says \\"You will be taken\\" and to leave the cell phone on.  A few moments later, my heart sank as they grabbed Kim, screaming and thrashing and drug her from under the bed.  Bryan tells the kidnappers to turn her loose and he won't kill them.  Of course, the ego-driven, invincible bad guys tell him something similar to \\"good luck\\". Well, the Albanians just unleashed their worst nightmare! Bryan, with all his training and skills in tact, is quickly on a plane to Paris on a hell-bent mission to get Kim back, no-holds barred.<br /><br />This is a kick-butt movie, full of intense action, stunts, car-chases, and killing.  While I'm not normally big on watching people get killed, I have to admit, the bad guys and their crimes were so despicable that I did enjoy seeing them get taken out, one by one.  There is edge-of-your-seat action as Bryan hunts down the bad guys one by one and weaves his way through the network of filth to try to find his little girl.<br /><br />Although extremely unlikely that he would have ever found her, it was a great movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Considering the subject matter, it was done fairly tastefully, too.<br />From what I remember, you did not actually see the sexual acts or the girls getting drugged.  A lot of people do get shot and someone does get tortured to find out needed information.<br /><br />Quite possibly, more of our teenagers need to be sensitized to the facts that these things do happen.  Although no one should live in fear, young women do need to exercise sufficient caution about where they go and who they go with. I hope this film will both entertain and educate our young people.how up to grab them.

B001P5Q6FC|3.0|Prior to \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" you knew what you were getting from LOG which is an your face hardcore sound with  awesome new school thrash guitar riffs and Randy's relentless vocals. Up to this point all of their albums had many signature songs that you can bang your head to.  \\"Ashes of the Wake\\"  represented their milestone great album where all the songs were catchy and aggressive resulting in one signature winnner after another that will live in infamy. \\"Sacrament\\" was a slight decline with not as many catchy homerun singles but, still had a couple of winners like \\"Walk with me in Hell\\" and \\"Redneck\\".. I can't find one signature single in this album that I can call a true winner.. I dont hear the same edge that they had in their prior stuff, it just seems bland in comparison. Certain songs have their moments but, they never reach  that great climax we come to expect from LOG.. nevertheless a solid album but, not up to standard. I guess LOG finally hit their wall where they've gone as far as they can go or maybe their trying to hard to reinvent themselves that they lost their edge? I'll give this 3-1/2 stars.

Don't look for any depth here, but there's a lot of fun and a little bit of romance. I'd probably pick up some of Kinsella's other standalone novels.

B0007TKNII|1.0|Hi,    I am really quite upset about this! I have already sent an email last week with comments that both of these DVD's have arrived in tact and so I've throw the packaging away only to find that they are both Region 1 (America and Canada) and not Region 2 (UK and Europe).My question was how do I return the items without the correct packaging or invoice/delivery note? And how do i get you to send me the correct ones? They are presents for Mothers Day (this coming weekend) and so now I will have to disappoint my mum as I presume I'll not hav ethem in time so cannot give her the presents I had planned! Nobody has come back to me at all and I was dissapointed in Amazon to start with for the wrong DVD's being sent but I am even more disappointed now at the lack of customer aftercare.    Please come back to me asap to see if we can rectify the issue!    Thank You,    Joanne Bloomfield

B001TWT0AE|5.0|I recently purchased [[ASIN:B000O179G8 The John Wayne Century Collection (Big Jake, Donovan's Reef, El Dorado, Hatari!, Hondo, In Harm's Way, Island in the Sky, McLintock!, Rio Lobo, The High and the Mighty, etc.)]], so I have the previous release of Paramount's \\"Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\". At the time I wondered why they put no extra features on the DVD. Now I know. So Paramount can double-dip yet another one of their classic films and not dig any deeper into their archives.<br /><br />As I've commented on the other Paramount Centennial releases, if you don't already have this film, buy the new release. It is one of the great westerns with two of the great acting talents of the 20th century together in one film, both doing what they do best. James Stewart plays the somewhat awkward big city lawyer who comes out to tame the west with law, John Wayne plays a local rancher who knows that some people only respond to the end of a gun, and then only if it is in the hands of someone who knows how to use it. The two men share the same love interest (Vera Miles), and a showdown with the meanest man in town - Liberty Valance - has one man getting the girl and the fame and the other getting a lifetime of obscurity. The following are the extra features, none of which exist on the most current Paramount release.<br /><br />Commentary by Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich along with his archival recordings with John Ford, John Wayne and James Stewart<br />Selected Scene Commentary with intro by Dan Ford along with his archival recordings with John Ford<br />The Size of Legends featurette<br />The Soul of Myth featurette<br />James Stewart and Lee Marvin featurette<br />Galleries<br />Theatrical Trailer

B001PPGAIA|2.0|I was very disappointed with this film. Given the strong connection to Xavier Herbert's book &#34;Poor Fellow My Country&#34; (and his earlier &#34;Capricornia&#34;), acknowledged near the end of the final credits, it would have been better to get a bit closer to either the facts or Herbert's stories. The beef baron was actually English, not Australian, and the kow-towing to the English was much greater in reality. The separation between whites and aborigines was far sharper and harsher than portrayed, and remains so, albeit significantly lessened these days (I lived in Darwin for some years). The peer pressure to conform to the social norms was far greater than portrayed. When was there ever an aboriginal woman who couldn't swim, or at least float? And where are these big cliffs and deserts between Katherine and Darwin? Herbert also viewed the behavior of many people in Darwin at the time of the first  Japanese bombing as quite shameful, and the conclusion of &#34;Poor Fellow My Country&#34; was anything but upbeat: it was a tragedy, pure and simple. The courageous died or disappeared, and the drones and the mindless mob inherited the Earth.  So, watch &#34;Australia&#34; for the scenery, for the cinematography, for some false nostalgia, a spot of romance, and some feel-good stuff, but don't mistake it for any kind of reality, past or present.

B001TOD9VI|5.0|While many praise this as Mickey's BIG comeback, maybe they didn't see Sin City back in 2005. That role put him back on the map for all those who saw it, but I have to admit that what he does in The Wrestler even towers head and shoulders above the character Marv that he brought to life so brilliantly. He should have won the Best Actor Oscar in my book. While Mickey Rourke is getting all the attention (he does deserve it), Marisa Tomei (she may be getting older, but she is still looking good here) is on top of her game as well and deserved her nomination. Rounding out the main cast is Evan Rachel Wood as the daughter of Mickey's character. She doesn't have much screen time, but she pulls off the part very well.<br /><br />I was briefly a fan of professional wrestling when I was in middle school, but quickly lost interest. You don't have to like that aspect of the film to enjoy the overall experience. The wrestling scenes don't make up that much of the movie anyway, but be warned, they are extremely brutal.<br /><br />When the credits start to roll, with Bruce Springsteen singing his great original song for the movie, The Wrestler leaves you battered and bruised, but the story will have a lasting tug on your heart and soul.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B001FBSMF8|1.0|From a long time Soundgarden fanatic and also enjoying Audioslave, this is definitely a train wreck.  I guess i really don't understand what Chris was thinking here. I could deal with his previous solo stuff, however not my favorite.  This i can not deal with and it will not be listened to again.  I'm actually going to his concert in May...i wonder if it will just be Chris with a keyboard pressing buttons to play these crappy beats/electronic BS.  Seriously, it's time to bring back one of the greatest bands of all time known as Soundgarden to rescue this guy.

B001P3SA94|3.0|Cadillac Records is the story of Chess Records opened by Leonard Chess in Chicago in the late 40's, and which quickly became a successful and influential record label (would Rock `n' Roll have existed without Chess?)<br /><br />The movie is narrated by Willie Dixon (Cedric The Entertainer) and he tells of Chess' (Adrian Brody) beginnings with a bar and a club on the south side of Chicago. The main players in the movies are Muddy Waters (Jeffery Wright) and Little Walter (a standout performance by Columbus Short) who are respectively the best guitar and harp players in Chicago. Chess discovers them when they crash his club and show up the band that is playing. Through the fortuitous burning down of his club Chess opens Chess Records and seeks out Waters, records him, and starts touring him in the south. Chess insures radio airplay with a little payola and Waters career takes off and so does Chess Records. When the money comes rolling in Chess pays Waters with new Cadillac's. New artists join Chess Records, Little Walter, the movie features Columbus Short singing My Babe that is such a standout it would be on MTV as a video if MTV still played videos. Willie Dixon comes on board as a writer/producer for Chess, Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker), Chuck Berry (Mos Def), and Beyonce as Etta James.<br /><br />The movie is shy about the financial liberties Chess took in paying his artists. Earlier in this review I mentioned that Chess bar burned down and their seems to be the inference that Chess could have done it for the insurance money. Chess' habit also of paying his artists in Cadillac's in lieu of cash, unfortunately he never asked his artists if that's how they would like to be paid. He also kept Waters on a short leash parsing out money to him and keeping him coming back to Chess for money. Chess rationalized this convincing himself that he was \\"taking care\\" of his artists, this paternal and essentially plantation mentality had to fuel some resentment between Waters, who had come from the cotton fields of the south, and Chess. Howlin' Wolf is one of the few artists at Chess that asked for and received his money. At one point Chess offers Wolf an advance and he refuses because he knows it isn't good to \\"borrow against the store\\" a way workers were kept in debt to companies.<br /><br />I read some of the previous reviews which mentioned some inaccuracies and events out of order. You have to remember movies are only the highlights of a life, in two hours you don't have time to show the events without a little license taken, events get compressed, characters combined into one, fictional scenes added to illustrate unknown or disputed periods in a life. One thing I did notice though is the anachronism in the time line in the movie. The Rolling Stones (some actors who look very little like The Stones, you only guess they're The Stones by their haircuts) come to pay homage to their idols, and Chuck Berry hears The Beach Boys on the radio and a couple of scenes later we see on TV a 1950's era Elvis on the TV.<br /><br />All the performances of the movie are good, I just found the presentation a little to typical of the genre. I liked how the ending links the music created at Chess Records with music that has come after Rock `n' Roll and Rap, it's a nice segue from the events in the movie to the present.<br /><br />The bonus features are disappointing, there's some deleted scenes, and two featurettes that I almost missed. The first is the actors talking about their characters and how they fit into the history of Chess Records, and the second is about the production design of the movie.he cotton fields of the south, and Chess.

B001LF4IA6|2.0|Man, I used to be such a Springsteen fan.<br /><br />I've been skimming the reviews here and looking to see if anyone was going to say anything...but I know when my disappointment started with the Boss.<br /><br />2004.  After spending decades staying out of the steaming mess that's American politics, I turn on the news and there's my rock hero, Bruce Springsteen...shilling for John Kerry.  The Boss, the artist who sang about the workin' man and down-trodden and just everyday folk, was openly campaigning for a rich Washington hack who never did anything that didn't dump a pile of cash in his account or further his own venal ambitions.<br /><br />Having tasted the poltical waters and survived, Bruce was front and center in openly campaigning for Barack Obama and in interviews backhanding anyone who didn't.<br /><br />Now he's just another limousine liberal, a celebrity living behind the walls and dining with the elite.  I had my suspicions when he recorded \\"57 Channels and Nothin' On\\" back in '92.  Was this his connection to the common folk now?  Cable television?<br /><br />Thank you, Bruce, for not destroying yourself like so many rock stars.  But you're not doing us any favors by telling us how to think and who to vote for.  I'm just not even interested in what you do anymore, sad to say.<br /><br />But look at Elvis.  Yes, he did destroy himself but at least he knew who he was in the world.  When asked what he thought about Vietnam and would he refuse to serve in the military again, he shook his head and said, \\"Ma'am, I'm just an entertainer and I'd just assume to keep my views to myself.\\"<br /><br />I wish our heroes would remember what made them our heroes and stick with that.
0525457585|5.0|First off I am 19 years old, so I'm no kid, and this book is amazing in every way. As a book reader of many sorts, fantasy has been my main genre focus for years, and this book, which I stumbled upon, is a true gem that I wish more people knew about. Although, if it was a popular book then it wouldn't be the gem it is. Anyway, any reader of fantasy that wants a good, and may I add, a VERY original piece of work, should give this book a try.    The book itself is revolved around a young boy named Bastian, who is one of those alienated, overweight, bulled children who never fits in with anybody and feels very excluded. As not to give away any spoilers, I'll just say that he stumbles upon a book, and finds himself as part of the story itself. This book has monsters unlike anything you've seen, has  an amazing storyline, and above all the characters are all unique and none are alike, making this story unforgettable and re-readable. Give this a try, you will not regret it!    Michael Ende, who I never heard of before this book, and whom I have only read The Neverending Story, although I am not sure if he has written anything else, is a very creative and intriguing author. Every chapter is graced with a beautiful illustration that involved something in the chapter itself, along with a huge letter, which is also the first letter in the first sentence. In other words, him along with this book, are very creative and original.    Also, I did see the first film, but if you read this book, like me, you may never want to see the film again. I did see the film after I read the book, and I hated it. So be warned, fans of the film reading this, do not expect it to be the same. Although, the book is much, much better, and when compared to the film, the film looks like a piece of work directed by a child who doesn't know the first thing about book-based movies. The book is better, no question or argument there.    All in all, this book is a masterpiece that I think every fan of trulygreat fantasy epics should read. It is my favorite fantasy novel, and book in general, and nothing quite surpasses it. Of course something like The Lord Of The Rings, or The Chronicles Of Narnia are the two greatest fantasy series of all time, The Neverending Story is better as a single book all it's own, and its so original that it can't be compared to any other book. Read this book, you will fall in love with it!
B0018LX9T4|4.0|When I think of erotic movies, I usually remember overstylized and heavy handed music video versions of movies that have little-to-no-understanding of how each particular lifestyle works.  The characters never feel like real people and their \\"exploration\\" into the kinky side of their sex lives comes across fake poses and clueless renderings--usually with bright lights and really loud music.  Since it's Hollywood, there has to be moment of \\"self-discovery\\" and/or \\"hitting bottom\\" before true, normal love prevails.  And they lived happily ever after.<br /><br />I remember reading about Stanley Kubrick's research for his orgy scenes in his final film, EYES WIDE SHUT.  After studying Roman orgies and such, he wasn't sure how to write the scenes where Tom Cruise infiltrates a high society orgy.  How does such things really work?  The only thing that made that scene work were the masks.  The quasi-religious ritual of pairing up partners...not so much.<br /><br />But then along comes SECRETARY.  And it works because it doesn't focus on the wild and kinky side of sex, but because it allows the kinks to come out of Real Characters.  Maybe that's why there are so few successful films about this (or any other) alternative lifestyle: the filmmakers are too fascinated by the acts than by the characters acting them out.<br /><br />In the extras, the director said he wanted to make a film about a successful S & M relationship the way that the earlier film MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE did for a gay relationship.  Mission accomplished.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this film 5 stars is that I couldn't track James Spader's character development as easily as I could Maggie Gyllenhaal's.  She is a genuine character who fully communicates everything visually and verbally and I was able to follow her.  Great actress, great part.  Spader was a little less defined.  As Maggie's character accepts and achieves her identity, I was wondering if Spader was as sure of his own sexual identity as the movie played out.<br /><br />Knowing people in this particular lifestyle, I have to try and ascertain from where this particular bent comes from--and how it expresses itself.  Yes, it's different, but I know people who love this style of relationship and see it as another avenue of pleasure, not some sick, twisted acting out of dark, crazy mental/emotional ailment.  There's nothing wrong with them, they just enjoy this.  I find that interesting.  And SECRETARY tells their story.Knowing people in this particular lifestyle, I have to try and ascertain from where this particular bent comes from--and how it expresses itself.

B000WMEAKC|5.0|This is by far the best CD I've ever listened to. I've been listening to it for months and can't stop. Can't wait for their next album!
B001L5SXQG|5.0|Great Bruce as usual - Music is wonderful.  A most needed item for any Springsteen fan.
B000002MUW|5.0|I'm not exactly a Madonna fan. I mean I like her music and all, but Bedtime Stories is the only \\"official\\" album of hers I own (I also have both of her greatest hits cds as well as the ballad set Something To Remember). We all know Madge is known for her radical transformations and chameleonesque ability to blend into any style of music. She opted for a softer R&B laced makeover to repair the damage caused from the in your face sexuality of both the Erotica record and SEX book (you know you saw it too!). She wasn't looking to be the next Mary J. Blige or Aaliyah, but she brilliantly incorporated hip hop beats with a trace of soul into her signature pop sound.<br /><br />On the sweet as candy Survival, the Material Girl admits she'll never be able to please everyone, but she'll gladly accept taking the hits from her critics. Legend has it that Secret is about a transgendered woman coming out to her boyfriend, but the interpretation is open so that the secret could be about anything. Although it's acoustic, it has an R&B flavor and I remember hearing it alot on soul radio stations as a kid.<br /><br />I'd Rather Be Your Lover reminds me of Prince's I Wanna Be Your Lover with it's whacky lyrics (\\"I'd even be your brother\\") and sensual undertone. Great guest spot for Meshell Ndegeocello (check her out for those not in the know). Tupac originally dropped some rhymes on it, but they were erased after some unrelated legal troubles. His rap was really good, but I prefer Meshell's husky but feminine delivery. The fluffy disco pop of Don't Stop is all about dancing and having fun. \\"Let the music shake you, let the rhythm take you/Feel it in your body, sing la dee da dee!\\"<br /><br />Madonna opens up about the pain over losing her mother when she was a little girl on the undulating Inside of Me. Although she's no longer alive, she knows her mom is always with her. \\"When my world seems to crumble all around/And foolish people try to bring me down/I just think of your smiling face/And I'm flying\\", she softly whispers on this track that samples both Aaliyah's Back and Forth (which was only a few months old at the time) and The Gap Band's Outstanding. I've never heard her so vulnerable.<br /><br />Her approach takes on a more confrontational tone on the hard edged Human Nature. She lashes out at the critics who judged her \\"for telling you my fantasies\\" with Erotica and sarcastically quips \\"Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex/I musta been crazy!\\" She makes it crystal clear she's not sorry in the least for what she did and I say \\"good for her\\"! Rejection is seen as a turn-on in the gurgly keyboards of Forbidden Love. Madge wants uninhibited passion with a lover, but Babyface (who produces and sings background vocals) warns her \\"Don't go near the fire, don't go in the dark/Don't give in to your desire, 'cause he's gonna break your heart!\\" Slyly erotic.<br /><br />The dramatically arranged Love Tried To Welcome Me is dedicated to a woman Madonna once met stripping at a bar. She'd known nothing but sorrow in her young life and felt too \\"guilty of lust and sin\\" to take love's hand when it came her way. It's a devastatingly beautiful song. The tribal Sanctuary eerily equates love with death. It's not as creepy as it sounds since Madonna claims undying devotion to the one she loves. The Bjork written Bedtime Story is a trance-like journey into another world. \\"Let's get unconcious, honey. Let's get unconcious.\\" It doesn't make very much sense, but it's better to just relax and go with the flow. \\"I'll never explain again.\\"<br /><br />Babyface's sweet tenor appears once again on the radio staple Take A Bow. With luscious strings and a fresh take on the \\"heartbreak as a dramatic stage play\\" analogy, Madonna tells a lover \\"The show is over, say good-bye\\" after lowering the curtain on their affair. Breathtaking.<br /><br />I might have to take a look at Madge's other work, but until then I'm just fine sitting pretty with this collection of soulful music that captivates the spirit.ul music that captivates the spirit.
0805080120|4.0|Convivial and enjoyable, the most remarkable aspect I found of The Unfolding of Language was that it made me look at the words I used and the words I heard differently.  As someone who speaks fluent Hebrew, his discursions on Semitic languages were the easiest for me to understand and impressive in their clarity. The only drawback, it seemed to me after a while, wasthat his desire to be witty sometimes got the better of him -- and made the book drag in parts.
B0009JAENU|5.0|This CD has been my favorite since I had it 2 years ago. I bought a few to give out as gifts to my friends. Hahn's performance is superb in this CD and Zhu deserves high praise for her impeccable play that balances with Hahn's. The duo play in styles and quality that I see a great fit with Mozart's.     The sound quality of this CD is so good that a mediocre bookshelf system could please your ears. It's not a well-known piece among Mozart's many popular works, but surely the CD should bring lasting joy and enjoyment to any people who like classic music, no matter their years of listening.
0395905079|5.0|Beyond the idea of darkest Peru - which is probably comes from the age of the book - the stories are glorious and i enjoy reading them to my daughter    Paddington is quite a bear and provides lots of material for teachable moments
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|This is by far the best album of 2008-2009 and probably close to LOG's best stuff yet. Not only does it sound like all band members have transcended themselves over and above the current metal scene but they have created one of their own best albums that wil surely stand the test of time. The transition from \\"The Passing\\" into \\"In Your Words\\" is probably one of the most amazing examples of musical perfection. It gets you going from the start and doesnt let up until the last track. This is surely going to playing in my car and room for a long long time. Cannot wait for their tour to hit the U.S.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Spectacular!!  A wonderful cd and it's hard to believe that Adele Atkins was 19 when she recorded this album!!  A great voice that is very mature yet very sweet at the same time!!  I enjoyed it so much that I bought more for family members as well. a 21 year old niece and a 52 year old brother!!!
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is like an 1.5 hour long commercial for one of the greatest cars ever made.  I could seriously just loop the audio of the exhaust noise and have a perfectly good night at home listening to that.  If you're a fan of the Challenger you have to have this movie.  Deathproof (Quentin Tarantino) is a very distant second place movie that stars this car.  I love it.  Get it.
0316017922|3.0|In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell purports to explore the root causes for success: what is it that makes people successful. Not just ordinary people, but outliers, those who are so accomplished that they lie outside normal experience. His basic claim is that the characteristics and personality of the individual are not the main explanation for their success. Rather, it is their environment which is the determining factor: when they were born, what culture and values they grew up with and how their family and community shaped them.<br /><br />Here are a couple of examples:<br /><br />- Forty percent of successful Canadian hockey players were born in January, February or March. Reason: the cut-off date for selecting players to the children teams is January 1st, so the older the child the more likely he is to be fitter and stronger than his classmates and be selected to the hockey team.<br /><br />- Successful corporate lawyers in New York will have a similar profile: born in the mid-1930s to Jewish immigrant garment workers. Reason: they went to underpopulated public schools, received inexpensive college education and were barred from mainstream law firms, leading them to specialise in takeover disputes which later became all the rage in corporate America.<br /><br />By far the most interesting story in the book is the chapter about the relationship between national culture and plane crashes. Gladwell analyses the example of Korean Air, who had a terrible crash record in the 1990s. Reason: the deferential, hierarchical culture of Koreans prevented first officers from challenging the captain's decisions in the cockpit even when these decisions were tragically wrong. (No chance of that happening in an EL AL cockpit, I guess). The same is true, apparently, also in Colombian culture.<br /><br />Outliers is a very entertaining book, and Gladwell is a gifted writer. But as with his previous books - The Tipping Point and Blink - I was left with a feeling that this is more of a collection of anecdotes rather than a rigorously researched study. It is almost impossible not to be captivated by Gladwell's narrative, but after the initial \\"wow\\" effect, one finds several holes in his \\"theory of success\\". If Korean Air planes crashed because of Korean culture, why does Asiana (the 2nd airline in Korea) have a good safety record? And if working in the rice paddies shaped the champions of mathematics and science among Asian immigrants, why did the same not happen to West African immigrants, who also grow rice for a living?<br /><br />It seems at times that Gladwell shot the arrow then painted the target. He had a theory and then looked for examples that support this theory. Not to mention the fact that if you believe Gladwell, then it really doesn't matter how smart you are and how hard you work. If you were born in the wrong generation or to the wrong parents, your chances of becoming exceptionally successful are very small. That is a very discouraging thought, especially in the prevalent American culture, so my guess is not many will like this book.orously researched study.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I work out almost daily but get bored easily.  This DVD is perfect for those days when I do not have time to drag myself to the gym or I am just not motivated, because after all, I can stand anything for just 20 minutes.  That is the beauty of this....only 20 minutes a day of a totally intense workout!!!!  I started with Level 1, and got through it with little trouble.  Level 2 is just right for me now - and I thought I was already pretty fit (for example, I go for one hour runs, do pilates, a bit of kick boxing).  I cannot imagine Level 3, it must be intense!
0307388840|1.0|Let's not beat around the bush. If I were ever asked to make a list of the ten worst books I've ever read, Atonement would be on that list. And pretty high up.<br /><br />I read Saturday by Ian McEwan a few months ago; picked it up at an airport. I liked it. So when I saw the movie Atonement was playing on several of the flights I was recently on, I decided to get the book first, before watching the movie. What a mistake.<br /><br />The plot of this book is superficial, not to say cheesy (a girl falsely accuses her sister's boyfriend for raping her cousin, and a long journey of \\"atonement\\" begins). McEwan's talent for descriptive writing is lost in tediously long passages that made me flip back a few pages just to remember where the story was left off. I found myself not caring what would happen next, but calculating how many pages I have left. The book took me ages to read; time and again I found myself yawning after a few pages, then dozing off into blissful sleep.<br /><br />Why waste words on such a terrible book. I have no idea why it became a bestseller and what all the hype is about. On a recent trip to London I bought On Chesil Beach, so I'm going to give McEwan another chance. Hopefully Atonement is nothing but an aberration.<br /><br />I should have known though... Through the book cover (I got the mass paperback version, depicted above) I learnt that the main character in the book - that annoying, whining, wish-I-could-smack-her, spoilt brat - Briony, is played by Keira Knightley, one of the worst actresses recently seen on the big screen. On second thoughts, what a fitting choice...
B001KZVQJI|5.0|The quality of the video,and audio,is perfect,I saw the extended longer version,it is flawless!I have not seen the regular original shorter theatrical version on this blu-ray disc yet,but am certain it is also very impressive indeed.This experience was even superior to watching it in the cinema in 2005,and is many times better than the DVD version.The only thing lacking here is in the way of extras and bonus features,you may want to keep the 3 DVD Special Edition released a while ago for this very reason,still,I do recommend the Blu-Ray version,although it is \\"NOT\\" a special edition,maybe a Blu-Ray Special Edition is not far off.Enjoy!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I just read that Russell Crowe was supposed to be \\"Drover\\" but a movie he was already working on ran on for too long.  THANK GOD!!  I cannot imagine anyone other than Hugh Jackman as \\"Drover.\\"  He is absolutely perfect in the role.  And, yes, I think he is 'the sexiest man alive.'  The scenery is just incredible (a great incentive to go see for one's self).  The music is beautiful and perfect.  This is a long-ish movie, but the director had no choice.  Leaving out any of the stories would have taken away from the depth of the characters and their backgrounds which propel the telling of the tale.  I've watched it twice and I'll watch it again.  I just love it.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Finally I got to see this movie and loved it.  The story of an orphaned boy who's parents connected love at first sight, had a one night stand, and conceived a child.  The mother played the cello, and father played in an alternative rock band.  The baby was taken from the mother and told he was dead by her very own father and given away for adoption.  After 11 years, on his death bed, father tells his daughter about the baby, and she begins a frantic search for him in New York City.  Evan taylor, who took the alias as August Rush, was extaodinarily talented and could 'feel the presence of his parents through sounds, and he was able to compose and play music as if he'd studied all of his life.  The couple reunites in New York City to find their 11 year old son conducting a rhapsody he'd written and was performing in cetral Park.  What a lovely story to say the music connects us and brings us together, and as artists, we have a sense of perception and being that trascends all time and distance.  A must see.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to say, I was skeptical. I have a graveyard of DVDs and wondered how this might be different. I have two children, work full time and have been grieving over my lack of time to work out. I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try (especially given the $9 price tag). Here is what I LOVE:     1. It is 20 minutes. You can do anything for 20 minutes!  2. The moves are simple yet effective. I have trained with a personal trainer and the combo cardio, strength and abs is old school and proven.   3. You can turn OFF Jillian's instruction. This feature is great because after doing the video a few times, you can begin to recite her comments and they are distracting.   4. There are three levels. I have yet to move through all three but the first two begin at intermediate so you do not feel that you are starting on too easy a level.   5. If you do this workout 3-6 days per week you WILL see improvements. I saw some definition after THREE workouts and not much dieting. Woo hoo!    Here is what can use some improvement:   1. The long intro which you cannot skip through.   2. The music - a little bland but I can deal with that.     All in all, this is by far the best investment you can make for your physical health. It is a must have for Moms who what their shape back after having the kids.     THANK YOU JILLIAN!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was a novice at doing at home workout videos prior to purchasing this one.  I liked Jillian's approach on TBL show.  I went on Amazon to purchase a different workout dvd mentioned in Us Weekly and this one caught my eye.  The price was good and the reviews were too.  I got it home and I have to say it really impressed me.  Her 3-2-1 method really works.  I've gone through all 3 levels now and each one is a challenge.  Although they are only 20 mins these workouts are TOUGH.  Get ready to sweat.  I would suggest using 3lb weights to start out with.  I use 5 but for a few of the moves it gets really tough.  I've seen great results in a short amount of time.  This one will be in my video rotation for a long time.    I look forward to trying her new videos next.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|I've followed the band Kings of Leon since they debuted in the early 2000's; these men have a similar voice quality to them. I love it! I heard of this album through recommendation of the Fray, and I definitely agree with Isaac-- this is a plug-in-your-headphones and relax kind of an album. I hope they continue to create beautiful music. Their harmony is amazing, and I love the old soul feel that the song compositions hold. I always look for writing in songs as well, and this band has some brilliant and beautiful lyrics. I would definitely recommend them; preview the songs and get a feel for the music though. I know they won't be everyone's \\"cup of tea.\\" My favorites are \\"Sun It Rises,\\" \\"White Winter Hymnal,\\" \\"Ragged Wood,\\" and \\"He Doesn't Know Why.\\"
0962477060|5.0|I got this book for one reason, to play guitar. If you can't afford lessons or don't have time for lessons this is the book. Self taught can be very frustrating this book will cut the time in half. All you need is discipline and penitence and you will become a guitar god in no time. The CAGED theory will work you as it did for me.
B001D08SK0|1.0|Many people have said it, but the following was damaged:    The LP  The CDs  The DVD    All scratched.    The books, etc are very nice, but not worth the inability to have good, clean vinyl.
1400067936|5.0|I've read this book twice.  The first time was perhaps around 5 years ago.  I liked it and agreed with his basic premise that humans are not highly rational and that markets can be very volatile and unpredictable.  Because of the current financial meltdown and because I saw the author participate in a group discussion on CNN concerning the meltdown, I decided to see if I still had a positive opinion of the book after a reread.      I really don't think Mr. Taleb was as egotistical as some of the other reviewers claim.  He has classical literary interests and enjoys working them into the narrative.  My reaction to many of the stockbroker and bond trader types that I've observed in the media over the years is that they have a rather unflattering image.  As a group, they appear to be a loud, unreflective, aggressive, and egotistical group.  I think a lot of the critics are angry that he brought into question what many of them do for a living:  perpetual bullish cheerleading a gullible public into purchasing overvalued and inflated securities.    He also questions the improper application of certain mathematical tools for economic analysis.  If I understand him correctly, this means the use of statistics for economic problems whereby you assume that you have normalized distributions resulting from your sampling of data.  He says to the contrary, you cannot truly normalize your sampling results and expected outcomes because you are dealing with highly volatile systems when analyzing markets.  Consequently, you must take into account the highly unexpected and highly dangerous events, the \\"Black Swans\\".  Another economics book reviewer on Amazon, a Mr. Brady, likes to make the comment that economics is really dealing with Cauchy distributions--not normal or Gaussian distributions.  Economic forecasting, consequently, is extremely difficult because of this volatility, irrational individual and mass behavior, etc.    Mr. Taleb appears to dismiss much of the mathematical modeling so characteristic of modern neo-classical economics.  In fact, in his recent interview in the Washington Post, he referred to modern economics as a \\"b******t science\\"!  Actually, my own view is that it really is a science.  But when it is most properly practiced, it is science in the vein of psychology, sociology, and anthropology.  It definitely ain't physics or rocket science.  One economist, Robert Nelson, has made the comment that modern day economics suffers from \\"physics envy.\\"  Modern day economics should make fewer claims to concrete knowledge, but should rather follow the path of the humble skeptic, trying piece together a coherent and accurate understanding of economic systems and institutions with appropriately chosen tools--mainly of the narrative variety, but with statistical and mathematical tools as well.  And where appropriate....    So, I can see why the author has made more than a few enemies and critics amongst his reviewers.  However, I think his fundamental take on markets and our present economic problems appear to be very accurate.  Markets--like men--are largely irrational, emotional, and volatile.  Investors and would be investors would be very well advised to keep those fundamental facts well in mind.  Mr. Taleb appears to be doing his best to educate them to those basic facts.  From my point of view, he is providing a laudable public service.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I went to a family gathering for my mother in law's 70th birthday in Australia last year.  My sister in law brought some books with her and she said I might like \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\".  The next 48 hours, I was consumed by Elizabeth's story.  I should have spent more time with my family but I couldn't put the book down!
B001F290E4|5.0|This is a great CD.  It is in grat shape.  It was shipped promptly.
031606792X|3.0|The reviews on this series are hilarious to me.  How can adults get so involved in a teen saga.  I read them to see what my grand daughters were reading.  Nice piece of fluff although a bit intense for a young teen. The story held my interest and was well paced except for #4 which dragged a bit and became obvious. I knew as soon as the baby girl lived that Jacob would \\"imprint\\".  It was just the way the story was going. So much time was spent on imprinting that the only suspense was who would be chosen for Jacob--baby girl of the one he loved but hadn't imprinted?  You betcha'.
B000002P2W|5.0|I have bought several items off of both ebay and amazon but have never bought such a quality product from any seller until now. You can buy with confidence here.
031606792X|2.0|This book was a disappointment.  I have enjoyed the campy Twilight series.  It is that sort of read you can have on an airplane or a book you can read when you just want someone to give you a happy entertaining story.      I know when I read a story like this it is akin to eating fast food.  I am not looking for intellectual nutrition, but at the same time I don't want to be able to predict everything that is going to happen in the book during the firs three chapters.      Unfortunately this book did nothing for me.  I was hoping to end the Twilight series on a much higher note.  That said if you liked the first three books in this fun innocuous series, then go ahead read this one too, just throw away your expectations and hopes.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I have been watching Dr. Who since the 70'ds. The new series is just as good as the old ones. I like the new edge they have given him but still kept his love of humans. I also like that they didn't get rid of all his old enemies and that they have bought in new foes for him to fight. Bringing back all the old travelers was great.  Bringing back the Dr.'s traveling mates in some cases let you know what  had become of them after they left the Dr. I amagine we will see some of them again as two of them have there own shows.  I think this season had the action and fast pace we exspect from the Dr.  I love this one as much as I have all of them and look forward to the new season.
0439023483|4.0|I thought this book was amazing. It's one of the few to be able to capture my attention after the Twilight series. Most every book i've read after Twilight has been stuck in its shadow, but this book holds it's own. I definitely reccomend it to anyone who is interested in adventure stories.
B00123IB32|4.0|What a fun, strong LP.  They love their Irish roots, but they love their rock n roll too.  Great lyrics and story telling along with full powered music.  I listened to this for months when it first came out and now my ipod keeps reminding me how great this music is.
B001P5HI4A|4.0|Finally this wonderful & enchanting film arrives on DVD.  A special thanks should be given to Ms. Streisand-who opened up her personal archives to be included.  Streisand has created some charming characters over the course of her career and this one is surely up there with Fanny Brice in \\"Funny Girl\\" and Katie in \\"The Way We Were\\". I believe this is her last really great, original performance on film.  It is a gentle, warm and knowing performance that radiates throughout the entire film.  The film itself is nearly perfect (I have a few quibbles with style/editing) but overall it is a gem and a grand accomplishment for a novice director.  Congratulations Barbra and thank you!
0810970686|5.0|My 9 year old LOVES this series. I have always had a hard time finding him a book that he will read. I bought these and he actually sat down and read the book from cover to cover in one day. then asked for the other books. trust me you will not be dissapointed.
0792839749|5.0|This is my second DVD I recently ordered from Amazon and they both arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  With the economy the way it is now, it is so nice to order a timeless children's movie such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as well as an updated PrintShop program online from a well-respected store at such an affordable price.  Thanks Amazon!  Dee
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I sit in silent having just finished the book. It has taken me to a world that has lifted me from mere living to heart racing  joy. I am in a state of joy for a book has again made me love the world. Thank you!
B0001CCXY8|5.0|I absolutely love this album because of its uniqueness and diversity between each track.  I even like this one over \\"Evisceration Plague\\" and \\"Kill\\" although all three are great albums.  \\"Wretched Spawn\\" could very well be one of the best with George.  \\"Wretched Spawn\\" has everything from characteristic Cannibal Corpse speed, to melodic downtempo grooves as heard in \\"Festering in the Crypt\\" and \\"Rotted Body Landslide\\".  If you like something a little more catchy, yet brutal, check out \\"Decency Defied\\".  This should satisfy any Corpse fan.  Overall, I think the production is great and all the band members display their utmost talent AND creativity in \\"Wretched Spawn\\".  As always, Cannibal Corpse plays very technical and intense death metal.  There is no part of this record that should let a Cannibal Corpse fan down.  My only suggestion for the production of this album is that the guitars should be just a little louder, but that issue is definitely worked out in \\"Kill\\" and \\"Evisceration Plague\\".  This is also one of the most \\"easy listening\\" albums of Cannibal Corpse.  This is not to say it will put you to sleep, I'm only saying that the construction of the tracks themselves are so smooth that it should be pleasing to a good death metal ear.  Enjoy this one!
B001ACH4DS|3.0|i expected this first cd to be great...it's not. i love david cook but this cd is so low key. david you need better songs!
B001F12J0C|5.0|Matt Damon is at his best in the Bourne series. You could say that he was Bourne to do this.
6305949980|4.0|This movie is pleasing to watch. One can easily see the details that went into the characters, the animation, and the background. Plus, the songs are catchy and entertaining. But, who cares? A good movie is only good if its story is good, and this movie's dark, whimsical plot makes it a classic.<br /><br />Nightmare Before Christmas's unique story is about Jack Skellington and his role in Halloween Town, but he is bored with his town's repetitive rituals. He leaves the town to find something new, and he finds it in Christmas Land. Jack is intrigued by this land and plans to take over Christmas this year. Exciting, right? Yes...and no! The tension between Sally and Dr. Finkelstein distracts me from the overall story.<br /><br />Their relationship is disturbing because it represents verbal and mental abuse. Dr. Finkelstein constantly remains Sally that he owns her, and he even locks her in a room, so she doesn't escape his control. Sally hates Dr. Finkelstein and performs extreme tactics to free herself from him. She dislocates her arm, poisons him, and jumps out of a window. There are moments in the movie where I am scared for Sally because I think Dr. Finkelstein is going to hit or kill her.<br /><br />Another problem in the story is Oogie Boogie. He randomly arrives toward the end of the movie and tortures Santa. I don't understand why he does this? I don't even understand his place in Halloween town. How did he become evil? Why did Jack lock him up in that dungeon? It seems like Oogie Boogie is thrown in the story so the audience could have someone to hate. I will admit, I like Oogie's musical number, but he is a cheap character. He needs more development, or he shouldn't be in the story at all.<br /><br />With these two negative aspects sprinkled in the story, this movie is still worth watching...only if you're an adult. If you are a child, I wonder hoe this beautifully wrapped gift of dark situations will affect your well being. I guess only time will tell.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This is a great compact way to have a bit of the Gilmore Girls in your home. It has eveything you could possibly want from special features, and a guide book with pictures to the COMPLETE book of Gilmorisms(and I mean complete) Well worth the money for us die hard fans!
0375707972|5.0|This book was received quickly and in tip-top condition.  A pleasure to read and own.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|I'm not going to list 100 reasons why you should buy this album (though I could) nor will I tell you what each song sounds like and is about. Just listen and you will understand. This album (for right now anyway) is my favorite Opeth album, but that changes more than I change my underwear. The only thing I didn't like is the pauses that were placed between the tracks. One of the songs (I can't remember which) was supposed to start immediately after the other, but they put that damn pause which makes the transition kind of awkward. That being said, you still shouldn't sleep on the special edition with the DVD the 5.1 surround makes it all worth while.
B000059T1V|5.0|This was the first Muddy Waters disc I purchased, and it remains one of my favorite blues albums by any artist. There is not a weakness in it to be found, including the excellent supporting cast, which includes Cotton on harmonica and Spann on piano. It's unfortunate that \\"Catfish Blues\\", which opened the set, was excluded from this disc for some reason. Sound is very good, which is not always a given when dealing with live performances, even today.
031606792X|5.0|Thanks to Stephenie Meyer for providing fascinating reading of the Twilight Saga.  Her final two-part book, Breaking Dawn, is in essence a sad experience, not for the content of the book, but for the realization that I won't be reading more about Bella, Edward, Jacob, and their incredible families and friends.  I have to admit I've read the first three books twice, and am in the final chapters of the second reading of the final book.  It is still leaving me literally on the edge of my seat.  I have tired eyes and a satisfied soul after reading Breaking Dawn, thanks to Ms. Meyer and her team.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|Honestly I was completely shocked when I ripped this cd open and popped it into my car.  But!!!!  It was still an all right collection of music.  We're so used to hearing Chris Cornell in his bluesy/rock atmosphere it was a bit refreshing and inspiring that an artist can branch out so far away from their comfort zone and come out with something this relevant(run on sentence, sorry).  His lyrics are still crazy cool!  Still love me some Chris Cornell.  Mmmmm-hmmmmm.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is set in the 1950s, as opposed to the 1930s, as in the previous movies in this series. In this one Indy is on the trail of a Crystal Skull, which is believed to have magical powers. As it is now the 1950s, the Soviets have replaced the Nazis, as Indiana's main adverseries.<br /><br />I felt the movie captured the era very well, the clothes, the politics and peoples attitudes at the time etc. There is a lot of action going on also, and found it enjoyable for the most part. Where I felt the movie fell apart was towards the end. It all started getting a bit too far fetched for my liking, and I can't help but feel, that this movie has somewhat tarnished what was an excellent series.
B00005NC66|4.0|Viewing this is surprisingly fresh:  all of the protagonists are evident mediocrities and even rather silly.  While they use fashionable vocabulary and \\"all the right moves\\", they are basically stupid and headed nowhere.<br /><br />So you get a petty thief, forced to act at extremes and hidden in Paris to get money owed to him, so that he can escape to Italy.  He has a string of GFs to exploit, and seeks to find one willing to help him in Paris, after another has apparently given him up to the cops after helping him to steal a car in Marseilles (the pathetic motive of all his crimes).  He finds one, a lovely American would-be journalist (Seeburg, who was to make a career in Paris, marry novelist Roman Gary and later commit suicide), whom he uses in the crudest self-serving manner.  She obliges, to a point, for unbelievably laughable reasons that are surely meant as satire in her stilted dialogue.<br /><br />The ending, nonetheless, is anything but expected, which in so many ways is the essence of New Wave realism.  I hugely enjoed watching this unfold, even though I had seen this when I first came to Paris.  I think it is a classic, though it has aged only medium well.<br /><br />Recommended.  Goddard is worth the effort, and the acting is good, however insipid the characters are by design.  It is fun, you see Paris at the beginning of the 1960s, and the ironies - including the unbelievably stale interview by Seeburg character, with a writer at the airport, made while she was harboring an evil fugitive - are well worth the price of admission.  But far better was yet to come in subsequent films.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|Some people said her 1st album was punk and some thought she was a poser. Some said it was just a pop album. Some say its rock, some pop rock or even punk pop rock. (For the record she can sing good live and does play the guitar) Her second CD was considered too emo by some and was more rock, i didn't think so, i loved it. it was the 1st avril cd i bought.     The problem was while singing songs from under my skin live she said they were too depressing so she wanted to make a album full of songs fun to play live ~ thats why her music sounds like it does, and i love it.    Hot, when you're gone, best damn thing, innocence, everything back but you, i can do better, - i like EVERY song except runaway, it's good but i don't think it sounds like an avril song so much.    you don't have to really like this cd, if you like her music i'd say yes, if not, don't. Ya don't know what you're missing!!! jk
B001R60ESE|5.0|I caught this show on PBS-WTTW in Chicago and it is spectacular! I fell in love during this show!  Chris Botti is a dream on the trumpet and the show from start to finish was fantastic!  He brings together such an array for talent that I was hooked from the first minute.  Even if you are not a \\"jazz\\" fan, this music is so mellow, so contemporary, so eclectic, so luscious that you can't help but enjoy it as I did.  I want to hear (see) it again, and again!!!
B001I0Z43Y|5.0|To get this work I first put a microSDHC in slot one and formatted it using a PSP slim. Then I took it out of the psp and replaced the microSDHC in slot one with another one and formatted that the same way. The last thing I did was the place both microSDHC cards in and format them at the same time. I believe this will prevent some of the problems I have read about dealing with slot 2 not working and slow downs. Note I am also you two microSDHC cards of the same brand, speed, and size.<br /><br />So far this has worked great and saved me a lot of money since pro duo cards cost a lot.  I have two 8 gb cards that seems to run just as fast as the 4gb pro duo card I replaced this with. The only negative is that the adapter feels cheap but that won't be a problem if you are not moving it around much. Just don't expect it to hold up if you drop something heavy on it or get it wet.
B000P7V46C|3.0|I saw the Trick & W&W tours, and I was suprised yet excited when Daryl Stermer was named as a touring player. But he was delagated to play Bass? The CD! I like Snowbound, Say It's Alright Joe, & Battle of Big. The Lady Lies played out real good in the Live Setting, as well as Deep In The Motherload. Genesis turned a corner after Steve Hackett's departure, and there future music just didn't satisfy me like it did before. This was the last Genesis release I bought, until CAS was released. But, that's a story for another day.
1439102813|4.0|Five stars for the story, the inexorable and electrifying train wreck of Alice Howland's mind.<br />  Four stars for the writing, workmanlike with occasional deft passages.<br />  Three stars for the dialogue, often flavorless or clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />The novel gets off to a gangly start, and by page 18, when Alice tells her daughter, \\"You're not getting any younger, Lydia. Life goes by too fast,\\" I made a note in the margin: \\"Only Alzheimer's will save this book.\\" And soon enough, it did. Anyone with the least knowledge of dementia knows where Alice is headed, but Lisa Genova finds plenty of conflict in Alice's struggles to hold on to her thoughts, and in the strained reactions of her husband and three grown children.<br /><br />Sometimes you can feel the author's research creaking in the background. But when the book anchors down on Alice and her confusions, the story is just right. There's Alice early on, covering up her lapses in memory and the words she can't pull up, fooling almost everyone but herself--but at a party, to everyone's embarrassment, she fails to recognize a woman she'd met only ten minutes earlier.<br /><br />\\"Still Alice\\" is a lively read about devastation. Some of the sidelines in the novel's plot barely matter--but the steady unmooring of Alice's mind grabbed me on page after page. The story is never without tension, because we want to see what happens, how fast it will happen, and how the author will handle a mind that's losing track of itself. She handles it well, having worked hard to imagine early-onset Alzheimer's from the inside, from Alice's point of view.<br /><br />Anyone interested in Alzheimer's and other dementias will find this a powerful book.
0880796863|5.0|The Original Rider-Waite Tarot Pack is a very good deck. However, the book is very small--the same size as the cards. In addition, the Celtic Cross Divinatory Chart is basically a small piece of paper stating where the cards go.     The pictures in this deck are much duller than the pictures in the other Rider-Waite Deck (or what's printed on the box, \\"The Rider Tarot Deck\\"). The pictures aren't as crisp in \\"The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack,\\" but for any lover of this deck it is a must. Again though, I do prefer the Rider-Waite-Smith deck that came out in the 1970s and was then called \\"the original.\\" That deck is also available on amazon and has a picture of The Magician on the box.     I do love both decks and both are probably as close to the \\"original\\" as we can hope, but perhaps this deck--even though it's a bit duller--is the closest to the \\"original\\" as we could ever hope for.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|The original \\"Rocky\\" is an amazing boxing film.  It wasn't high budget.  It did not have huge stars in the main roles.  It was nitty-gritty.  It worked.  Forget the sequels.  They are OK. But, Rocky is the only GREAT movie of the bunch.    It has its faults, including being somewhat overly sentimental, but it may be the best boxing film ever.    Also, Sly Stallone is an OK action actor, but this is the one film where he does an absolutely terrific job.    Personally, my favorite scene is the one in the ice skating rink.    And, of course, the boxing match scenes are awesome!
B000002L42|4.0|The album is filled with well executed studio like quality versions of songs from a band that did'nt want to tour during their \\"heyday\\" because they wanted to polish each note before the public was to hear it. They definitely pulled off a clean meticulous \\"jazz fusion like\\" melodious pop sound. Why were they so worried about about touring? It was nice to finally hear their songs \\"air out\\" live in concert.     My only problem with this record is that there are too many \\"deep cuts.\\" Indeed,I would have been OK with all the selections on this album if they would have added more familiar Steely Dan songs to make it a double or triple disc. However, if they wanted to release only one disc they should of swapped out many of the lesser known tunes for more recognizable ones.
0440244870|5.0|Book in excellent condition! Sale went extremely well with seller. I would defintely by from them again.     The book is a great read for any woman who loves shopping! Fun characters too!
B000001A9P|5.0|Steve Wonder and a full orchestra: How can this not be good?<br /><br />One of the best live recordings ever!!! From the first track to the last, Stevie proves that he is \\"The Musical Genius of Our Time\\"... No if, ands, or buts!!!!<br /><br />Every time I listen to this CD I find something new.... That I like!!!<br /><br />A definite must for any serious music lover.<br /><br />-Film Director J.L. Botelho<br />Triad Pictures
067144901X|5.0|Sandra's books are my 1 year old's favorites. My 4 year old loves to read them to his little brother as well. Very cute.
1400082773|5.0|I love this book because it's so unpretentious and honest for someone with political aspirations; perhaps Obama didn't have any when he wrote the book after graduating from law school. In any event, he's President now and I'm very grateful to have this view into his childhood and organizing years in Chicago.
0810970686|5.0|My 10 year old grandson loved this book.  He can't wait until the next book (#4) is released.  He asks about it all the time.
B0000029DD|5.0|I heard this album for the first time a few days ago and my life will not be the same again.  It is not just that Jeff Buckley's voice soars like that of an angel, his voice touches you deep within your heart and soul and unleashes emotions you may not know you were capable of expressing.  This album is so original, because the band was not catering to any one audience they were able to produce a masterpiece with everything from an old traditional English hymn to the most beautiful blues inspired song I have ever heard \\"Lilac wine\\".  Jeff Buckley is the model for any songwriter/singer who does not want to buy into the generic sounding, finance driven aspect of the music industry.   Jeff Buckley was a genius and an angel child, we thank him for this gift and pray he rests in peace.
1439136653|2.0|I was actually born in Mumbai and Slumdog Millionaire is one of my top 5 movies, but I read this book and was very disappointed. I expected it to be raw and beautiful like the movie, but it wasn't. It was all over the place and very hard to get into. Instead of rehashing everything that everyone said, just read the one and two star reviews, and that's pretty much the way I feel about this book.
1416562605|4.0|Really like how dead-on this book was concerning indian culture. Very dark humor, similar to a Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell.
B0000028M7|3.0|When I first heard this I thought it was like an advance release of the new Poison album.  Really makes you wanna party hard like Poison.  That being said, they don't quite have the looks of Poison.  Still it makes you wanna put the top down on your convertible and drive down to the lake to check out the action.  This album really gets you going but what it really needs is a party-all-the-time anthem to really get you going.
B001HY3BFE|5.0|Very good album. As usual the heavy and clear Saxon's sound ! The track 1 and 5 are dynamite. Good riff, heavy guitar, solo duet, and of course nice voice. No complain, one more fantastic album to the Saxon Saga.
B00195BM3Y|5.0|The Chameleons, from Manchester, England, were nearly in the same league as Echo & the Bunnymen and The Teardrop Explodes, from nearby Liverpool.<br />\\"Script of the Bridge\\" is, perhaps, The Chameleons best album.  If you like it, be sure to check out \\"Crocodiles\\" and \\"Heaven Up Here\\" by Echo & the Bunnymen, as those albums have a similar neo-psychedelic sound.
B00104W8T6|5.0|First of all, this soundtrack is awesome, and there are no bad tracks on the CD.  I especially love the punky sounds of Kimya Dawson from the Moldy Peaches, but there is more to this album than just her.  It expresses a combination of alternative, punk, rock, rockabilly, and even some pop rock.  I also love the older rock and pop rock bands like Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth, Buddy Holly, and Mott the Hoople.    My husband and I watched the movie and half way through I knew I was going to have to the soundtrack.  There is another soundtrack for this film, and it has even more tracks.  I don't know if it's better though, as I really do like this one.  I used the original Moldy Peaches song Anyone Else but You sung by Ellen Page, and Micheal Cera my ringtone when my hubby calls.  The ringtone makes me smile every time he calls.    It has become one of my favorite albums, and I haven't tired of listening to it yet.      Thanks for your time, and enjoy!
B001RIY49C|5.0|As of today this package is only available for pre-order and we don't know if the skull is metal or plastic. I wouldn't mind paying $120 for these disks if the skull was metal. However, if it is just plastic then I'd want all the Terminator movies from T1 to T4.<br /><br />(p.s. I think the Terminator franchise is taking a page from the Blade Runner franchise with their 5-disk ultimate set which came with Decker's Briefcase. That kit was introduced at over $80 but eventually came down to the mid $50 range. Since BR only one movie in several versions, they had to bring it out with extras in 5 disks)
B0013NS6EU|1.0|The text of the book is great, but the pictures just don't come across on the Kindle, even enlarged. The text is blurry and the image is grayed out and faint.     Too bad I can't return it.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|Awesome sounds along with my favorite voice of the century. Definately not tired and same old. Very excited to see what's next.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This Baz Luhrman film is a great epic...the storyline however, doesn't flow at your typical Hollywood-flick pace. Some people stopped watching after fifteen minutes, but the thing about Baz Lurhman is that the first minutes of his films are always kind of strange. I almost walked out of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" the first time I saw it in the theatre, it was a good 10-15 minutes before the film settled down from wacky cuts and got down to business. And when it did, it was spectacular. The same applies to this movie.     Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are great together, and you can't help but really like the kid who plays \\"Nala\\". If you like movies that are different (specifically, if you like foreign films - they are paced differently) you will love \\"Australia\\". If you loved \\"Moulin Rouge\\" - you will love Australia. But if you need instant gratification in your movies, this will be too slow for you.     I take one star away because there is only one special feature: Deleted Scenes. I suspect FOX will release \\"special edition\\" further down the road will all the extras, and that's greedy BS in my book.
045122499X|2.0|I picked up World Without End at the library because after trudging through Pillars of the Earth, I wasn't sure I wanted to give Ken Follet any more of my money. I'm glad of that, because I'd be pretty cheesed with myself if I'd forked over money for this opus. It's a somewhat boring rehash of Pillars, full of one dimensional characters and seemingly random plot devices.    The first hundred pages or so are dry, I think it was at about page 150 that I told my wife I just couldn't get attached to the story. Things start to pick up after that and the characters liven up a bit, but soon the story starts to fall apart as random plot twists destroy any sense of continuity or story arc.    At about the 3/4 mark I gave up and skimmed to the end to see how things ended, and returned it to the library. I doubt I'll try any more of Follet's work.
B000002UAR|5.0|Located at one of the most pivotal stress points in the history of rock music, this extraordinary masterpiece by its most important band, the Beatles, comes nearly a year before the unprecedented breakthrough of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Revolver is often seen as a transitional album, but it is also a record of culmination. This was the last time we would hear or think of the Beatles as the Beatles, in the traditional sense of the term. Revolver exists as a key moment at which all cultural categories were on the verge of exploding into a fully blown \\"big bang\\" of completely new and seemingly inexhaustible dimensions.     \\"Progress\\" was a key term in counter-cultural thinking, and the Beatles, though arriving fully formed, spent three remarkable years refining and enlarging their musical and conceptual techniques in a continuous march that baffled and amazed the world. In December 1965, the group released Rubber Soul, their absolute development of musical/emotional maturity. Revolver is the sound of the scratching at the surface of a wall that nobody except the group seemed to realize existed.     With Sgt. Pepper, the Beatles would simply jump over the wall and re-define the parameters of reality itself. Revolver is their last appearance in the youthful and innocent garb of predefined categories of thought and expression.     This is not to suggest that Revolver was not revolutionary. Revolution and innovation is the defining process of the album. No one - not even Dylan - had pushed the boundaries of popular music to such a straining point this - it was pop music at the most extreme degree imaginable. (Next year would come the unimaginable.)     \\"Taxman\\" pushes the hard rock envelope further than ever before, with its harsh shards of chords, its cynicism and the dumfounding electric guitar explosion of its center. \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" shocks in its empathy and insight into banal human suffering while reinvinting the classical string quartet as a most potent new example of instrumental modernity. \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" wraps the listener in gently-rocking layers and discovers the key to the psyche through backward-tracked guitars.     \\"Love You To\\" continues with the then-unknown drones and modalities of Indian classical music. \\"Here, There And Everywhere\\" charms quietly with its unexpected modulations and its already determinedly retro style. \\"Yellow Submarine\\" discovers the children's song can be a modern adult art form. And the climactic whiplash of \\"She Said She Said\\" with its surreal paranoia, shifting meters and impossibly swriling drums set a rock song as far as it could possibly go without completely coming apart.     Side two is just as stunning, beginning with the celebratory benefaction of \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" the savage double-tracked guitars of \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" and the melancholy perfection of \\"For No One.\\" The steely-eyed chomp and mock of \\"Doctor Robert\\" winks hard at those in the know. \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" with its disjointed rhythms places the listener in a decidedly uncertain position to reality, while \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" charges the spirit with some of the toughest, happiest white soul music ever. The entire affair ends with \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\"  - a new kind of rocking applied to a new purpose - chanting to the Tibetan Book of the Dead.     Today, many people regard it as the Beatles' finest record. I won't argue with that. I will simply affirm that it is both their ultimate culmination as a rock group while staking out virtually all new territory for the unimaginable future. More than essential, it is absolutely necessary - and it its turning never even begins to get tired.
B00000269J|5.0|No longer a Roger Waters band, now a David Gilmour band, the music Pink Floyd puts out is very noticeable.  Yet the band perseveres & presses forward.  Still it's a good, worthwhile album to be had in any music collection & very much recommended by me.  Apparently, it's supposed to be the sequel to Dark Side Of The Moon; but as far as I'm concerned, nothing holds a candle to Dark Side Of The Moon; no pun intended.
B0001HLVSC|5.0|The book series was an excellent read and this movie is just as entertaining.  Fascinating look at service in the Royal Navy and life on a fighting ship of that time.  There should be more movies that further develop the character of Jack Aubrey.
B000HWZ5WE|5.0|Robert Plant returns to his roots of Rythym & Blues on this album.  None of the songs are originals, they are all cover-songs; yet very well done.  Some of my favorite albums are cover-songs & this is one of them.
0740748475|5.0|very excellent quality a bit on the large side if your going to be reading and not just shelving but an Awesome find
B000002X2B|5.0|I have found it difficult to review anything that I am wishy-washy about. I have to love or hate the product, middle ground is boring. Look, I don't care for the anti-music concept of bands such as: The Sex Pistols, but I do understand where they are comin' from. With Paul Kantner's, fantastic recording from 1970 entitled: \\"Blows Against The Empire\\".... I am as biased as they come....I love this album!<br /><br />Paul Kantner, had a batch of songs that told the story of a bunch of hippies that build a starship and blast off for a better world, {DANGER! DANGER! Will Robinson!} somewhere, out there. What takes the nutty story up by more than a few notches is that Paul, has about about every musican from San Francisco, helping him on this project. Jerry Garcia, Micky Hart, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Jack Cassady and some lady named Grace Slick all add wonderful parts to this big universe that Paul has created.<br /><br />From, the folk music of; \\"The Baby Tree\\" to the space-weirdness of: \\"Hijack\\" the music is different from anything else you have heard. Garcia, lays down some of his finest guitar parts, ever found on a studio recording. Crosby, helps out with spot-on harmonies and songwriting skills.

0783225903|4.0|How is one supposed to summarize this movie without egregious use of the phrase `Orwellian?' Let me just say this - It's like Life Of Brian, only replace the Christ story with 1984 and remove about half the cheap jokes. There. I can't put it any simpler than that. Anyways, as you may or may not know, this film exists in three different versions-The original European release (132 Min.) the original U.S. release (92 Min.), and the director's cut (142 Min.). If you wish to own all three, go with the Criterion multi disc deluxe set. If you only want the director's cut with the extra 10 min, Criterion has been kind enough to issue it a la carte, So you don't need to waste extra cash and storage space on a multi-disc behemoth. The cheapest and, in my opinion, best option, is the 132-minute Universal single disc release. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to film, and it is with heavy heart that I reveal this, but I couldn't tell the difference between the Universal and Criterion single disc versions. The Criterion version has an extra 10 minutes in there somewhere, but I'll be darned if I can find them. So, if you're a casual fan of the film, I recommend the Universal version. It's a more or less complete presentation of the film, and it's anywhere from $5-15 cheaper than the Criterion single disc edition.
B0013N7AD8|3.0|The sound on all the movies is great!  The video on all the movies is great except for the first Batman which is very disappointing.  The first Batman is no way near the video quality of the other three films.  WHY????  That is bizarre if you ask me.      Also, why no digital copy for ALL the movies????  There is only a digital copy of Batman.      Finally, the box itself that these discs come in is awful, IMO.      Now Warner has announced a stand alone blu-ray of Batman as well.
B000069HSP|5.0|Numerous movies have been made about the Vietnam conflict.  Most of those films dismiss the actual experience of soldiers who served in that theater.  Many were created to make political points by people against the war.  Whatever the  motive of the film makers, the soldiers were treated badly.  The Vietnam conflict may have been politically a mistake, but those who served simply did their duty, most with honor.  It was always  unpardonable to picture our soldiers as villains.<br /><br />We were soldiers is very unusual among war movies.  First it is based upon the actual experience of the heroes who shed blood and put their lives in danger to serve their country.  Bravo!<br /><br />The film traces the origin of the air cavalry.  It pictures the training required to make ordinary soldiers into combat troops.  It demonstrates the development of junior leaders.  Training scenes are not only authentic, they are fun.<br /><br />The battle scenes are realistic and show the danger or being under fire.  The interaction of the commander with the troops is effective and delightful.  The characterization of the command sergeant major reminds me pleasantly of the outstanding sergeants major with whom I have served.<br /><br />Finally a movie does a bit of justice to the magnificent soldiers who served  in Vietnam.  I hope that someone in the industry repeats this for our military in Iraq and Afghanistan.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. Listened to it twice all they way through the very first day. On my playlist.
B000KF62MK|4.0|This DVD came with a copy of X-Men \\"The Last Stand\\". The packaging for this bonus disc is a complete lie regarding the actual content of the DVD. It says there are two \\"Fox Movie Channel Presents\\" segments on this disc entitled \\"Casting Session\\" and \\"Life After Film School\\". I was a little surprised after popping in the DVD because it is actually about the evolution of the X-men comics. It takes you through the different eras of the X-men comic franchise, talking to the many writers and artists responsible for creating the X-men. While this wasn't at all what I expected when I bought this DVD, I found it very interesting and am still happy with the purchase. Plus, the packaging promises 36 minutes of material, but the different content actually runs 1 hr. 8 minutes. So really, you're getting more bang for your buck. I recommend this to anyone wanting an inside look at the X-men comics, but beware if you're seeking anything involving the movies.
B00004WF68|5.0|I own \\"Heaven Is In Your Mind\\" which is the U.S. release of this album and it's excellent, but as far as I'm concerned the U.K. mono CD titled \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" is VASTLY SUPERIOR to the stereo version!!! I suppose it's a matter of taste, but the mono presented here has a drastically different, slicker psychedelic sound to it. As far as I'm concerned, there's only one solution here...buy both and listen for yourself. Some of you will like one more than the other, and I believe most Traffic fans will ultimately want both versions of this masterpiece. But for my money, if I had to choose only one the U.K. mono version wins HANDS DOWN!!! Hope this helps. Happy listening :-)

From the packaging, to the production values, to the DVD extras this 7 DVD set is as rewarding to own as it is to watch over and over. In fact with a home theater set up, its even better than the original TV show. Enjoy and collect all 7 seasons.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|It's hard to convey in words the way I felt when I heard this. One of the best rock vocalists of my generations put into the Christina Aguilera crap music machine. A sad moment indeed. No coming back from this I'm afraid -- it devalues EVERY project he's been associated with in my mind.
0321543726|5.0|This is the first programming book Ive seen that takes an open honest look at how to program. Not just give syntax rules and useless code snippets on how to make the meow method of a kitten class work, but really how to go through the thinking process of thinking up base concepts, implementing them, and hitting all the mistakes and false starts. Its so surprising that Stroustrup would be the first to write a programming book in this way as his writing has always struck me as out of reach to programmers not at university/professional skill level. You'll feel a lot less embarrased about simple syntax mistakes and confusion over reading code when reading this book.    For all the reviewers who are complaining that this book is too hard, I think the problem is with chapters 6 and 7 which show how to make a parser. Chapter 6 sort of puts the cart before the horse and first shows how sections of code work and then later in the chapter explains the concepts behind why it works. So if you are stuck, just read the whole chapter, and if by the end of chapter 6 you still dont get it, just skip ch6 and ch7 as they are really just a \\"scenic detour\\" and wont effect your learning of C++.    And for all the reviewers who are complaining about the large ammount of errata for this book, I suggest you take a look at the errata page for \\"Accelerated C++\\" (one of the most highly lauded introductory C++ books): [...] where you will notice a high percentage of errors are technical errors whereas most all the errors for Stroustrup's book are just spelling/grammar errors.
B000002KB8|5.0|Kelsey, you are an idiot and really need to do your research before typing any kind of product review online.  Black Sabbath had already been around for an entire decade when Metallica was formed, and this is their first album.  So you want us to believe that Black Sabbath are just wannabes of a band that didn't even exist at the time and that they \\"stole riffs\\" from albums that were made over 30 years later?!    BTW...Slipknot, Staind, and Puddle of Mudd are NOT real metal, far from it actually.  As far as Metallica is concerned, their old stuff was metal.  St. Anger as well as pretty much everything else that came after And Justice For All is NOT.
B000ZN802W|5.0|An amazingly well shot, scripted, acted, and scored (soundtracked?) film. It could not have been made better, and Alexander Supertramp would have approved.<br /><br />If you hated it, wished something would have happened, or thought McCandless was selfish, well, all I can say is, after your dinner at Applebee's, go back to your box in the suburbs, turn on Dancing with the Stars, and continue living the mundane life your parents told you to live. I'm sure you'll be very happy.
B001P5Q6F2|2.0|The fact that so many fans have given this a 5 star rating just proves to me how far the music scene has fallen.  This time around, Lamb of God, one of the best thrash metal acts to hit the scene since Pantera, set out to make a purely aggressive album.  In this they succeeded.  Unfortunately, in the process they have shed any ounce of feeling or shred of originality.  This is as bland as metal gets.  From start to finish I barely recognize one song from the next and despite the breakneck pace, I find myself yawning.  I love these guys, and I gave this album 3 solid listens all in different environments:  nothing.  I already had qualms with Sacrament, but it was still a good album.  This is not.  It is complete tripe, and even professional reviewers I normally disagree with know it.  If you ask me, As the Palaces Burn is easily their best effort with Ashes of the Wake a close second.  But even Burn The Priest and New American Gospel stand taller than Wrath despite their shortcomings in production and focus.  This album is easily forgotten.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Patton is one of my all time favorite films and I have owned it in just about every format known to man. I will not review the movie. We all know it's great and it has been reviewed to death, but I did want to comment on the Blu-Ray version. It is simply amazing. The video transfer is crystal clear, the colors are lush and gorgeous yet realistic and not overblown. The surround mix is incredible and those battle scenes will definitely give the sub a workout. This has become the new show-off movie for my system. Everybody is surprised that my reference demo is a 40-year old movie! If you have an HDTV and even if you already own the DVD do yourself a favor and pick up the Blu-Ray version. You won't be disappointed.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|What peeked my interest and my purchase of this album......I had heard the initial broadcast of David Gilmore on Satalite radio , by a station called \\" Classic Vinyl \\" . Where they feature an artist and an album .        This particular station , actually played the entire album . And interviewed David and other band members between plays . Telling about the rhymes and reasons , behind the recording of this particular album . And some of his past experiences with \\" Pink Floyd \\" .        I not only enjoyed  the music on this album , but the time spent on the interview ....also . David Gilmore is a very personable kind of an artist.....!

B00007L4MJ|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite films! It is a visually stunning movie, all the more for being made 82 years ago. Kino did a fantastic job of restoring the print to where it looks like a movie made much more recently. I have heard from several places that there is a newly discovered 210-minute virtually complete print of the film and Kino will be releasing it in 2010. If so, I will definitely be double-dipping on this movie.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Wall.E is supposely a children's movie but I thought it was hilarious. There are parts in the movie that I'm sure will be over the younger one's heads but adults will find very funny. It's great the way these movies are now children and adult friendly. I highly recommend this movie if you want a funny entertainig time.
B001QB9H10|5.0|I don't care what everyone else has said about this Movie. Its just as good as the rest if not a notch better. Sound track rocks and the action is just superb. For all that had negative reviews, you all are just trying to down grade this for what ever. I own every movie that Jason has ever been in and this is one of his best. So for all of you negative people. SIUYA.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|The music that John Barry wrote for Dances With Wolves (the original movie soundtrack) is gorgeous. It has wonderful parts for the brass instruments, and great opportunities for the percussion section as well.    Even though the movie was produced some time ago the sound is excellent, with great dynanic range.

1932100660|4.0|More information than most people want to acknowledge. We may be living longer, but we are not necessarily living better. Can we improve our lives by removing dairy and \\"meat\\" from our diets? After a friend recovered from stage 4 breast cancer by changing her diet and her spiritual and psychological mentality I had to read \\"The China Study\\" to find out what she knew that I didn't. The question is... do I have the determination and desire to adhere to such a reformation of eating?     This is a must read for anyone who eats! Yes, anyone!
B000002KON|5.0|Hoo boy! List the twenty albums that I have listened to more than any others in the last thirty or so years and this album will be there (along with several Beatles albums, Blonde on Blonde, Let it Bleed, etc.). This is the Kinks at their best. I bought this album on the basis of a positive review when it came out and, boy, am I glad that I did. Always more popular in the USA than in the UK, this album was embraced by yanks because of its highly melodic and tightly arranged songs about England in happier days. Few bands played this well. Few composers could turn out songs the way that Ray Davies did. Still brings a smile to my face when I hear one of these songs. Highly recommended.

1400032717|5.0|In creating Christopher Boone the central character of this novel, Mark Haddon has made a leap of understanding that is both amazing and excruciating at the same time. His prior work as a more or less conventional mystery writer gives no insight as to how or why he was able to capture the persona of this painfully complex human being. Christopher is an autistic boy who has savant talents for memory, math and a superior innate intelligence. At the same time he manifests profound disabilities that limit his ability  care for his own basic hygiene or to interpret the world around him or the emotions and motivations of the people in it. His daily routine of repeated tasks and and introspective thought are interrupted by impulses that require him to wail,rock, and recoil from human touch. The strains of caring for him as he grows into adolescence has imploded his parents marriage and creates the background for a most unusual murder mystery; the killing of a dog, which Christopher feels compelled to understand and come to grips with. As we follow Christopher as he tries to solve the crime,redefine his relationship with his parents, and grasp at independence we get a painful insight into what it would be like to have great intelligence yet live  with the neuro-chemical brain chaos and twisted perception that must be the world of an autistic person on the mid to severe end of the spectrum. This is not only a good story but I think it should be recommended reading for any one who works with developmentally disabled persons or maybe just loves and cares for one.

0316067598|5.0|[[ASIN:0316044695 Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10]]<br /><br />I wondered about half way through the book why the author was spending so much time describing what one goes though to become a Navy Seal. Later I discovered the author had to go through this process for the reader to have some basic understanding of why these brave men did what they did. The story is a little slow at first but again, it is well worth reading through it so you can really appreciate how someone can make the ultimate sacrifice. They really never thought about it once the action began, their training took over and they took the necessary actions. It is truly unbelievable that there was even one survivor.
0061148512|2.0|I am almost sorry to say that my reading of Sylvia Plath's novel \\"The Bell Jar\\" was not nearly as moving or thought-provoking as it seems to be for so many. In my opinion, \\"The Bell Jar\\"'s Esther Greenwood is entirely unsympathetic, to the detriment of the novel. While I recognize the necessity of emphasizing her deterioration, I found her to be overly melodramatic and weak (while still recognizing her \\"condition\\"), and I loathed her from the start. While I will allow that Plath's prose is more eloquent than her poetry I failed to find evidence of the brilliance so often extolled.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I rarely watch TV, and I even more rarely watch the same TV twice. But after finishing the fourth season of Lost, I felt I had to go back and see the show from the beginning.<br /><br />While the show started off well, with its diverse cast of backstory-laden survivors, this is the season that gave the island its own mythology: The Dharma Initiative, the Others, the hatches, the anomaly--everything that's kept the show interesting ever since. Nearly every episode contains a surprising revelation about the island, or a twist that changes everything, and yet most of the season's tangled plot threads are neatly wrapped up in the epic 2-hour finale.<br /><br />The DVD set also contains some good special features, which are stylishly put together. If you're going to own any season of Lost, make it this one.
0060935464|4.0|As part of my reading list this year I have decided to return to some of the classics I read in grade school, and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was at the top of my list. At this point I'm not quite sure how I feel about the novel - I neither liked it, nor disliked it. The choice of narrator was brilliant on Lee's part, and I greatly appreciated seeing such poignant events through the eyes of children. Lee's writing style itself gives much to be admired, and is a wonderful example of a marriage between creativity and craftsmanship. However, the novel has left me with a feeling of melancholy that is keeping me from joyous praise.
B0015AARJI|5.0|What can I say? This is the official, wireless, SIXAXIS (spell that backwards and it's the same), vibrating controller by Sony for the PS3. I once bought an off-brand controller for my Super Nintendo years ago, and it broke with no abuse within a year or so. The official, Nintendo SNES controller never gave me any trouble. There's a reason why the official controllers from the companies who made the actual console cost so much: they *work*. If you buy a PS3 controller, make sure it's this one. Avoid any that aren't Dual Shock 3, as those are older models that don't vibrate. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps you with your decision.
0385339682|1.0|I can't believe how bad this book is. It's the first John Grisham novel I have ever read. It is simply dead boring. There is nothing about it that makes it a \\"thriller.\\" The title is completely misleading. Don't even waste your time getting this book out of the library unless you want to read a long drawn out story about a small town in the south. It's not even a good story about that. I agree with everyone else who gave this book one star (or less).
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Director (and co-writer) Baz Luhrmann's AUSTRALIA is an epic historical romantic drama, sort of a \\"Down Under\\" GONE WITH THE WIND.<br /><br />Set prior to and during World War II, the visually stunning film is long (165 minutes), but extremely entertaining.  Nicole Kidman stars as an English aristocrat who travels to the primitive, faraway continent to take over a a cattle ranch after her husband is killed.  Hugh Jackman is the rough-hewn cattle driver, who helps Nicole get her herd to market and, ultimately, wins her heart.  They make a handsome on-screen couple.<br /><br />Of course, there are villains (David Wenham, Bryon Brown) who try to prevent their cattle drive from succeeding, then there are also the Japanese who bomb the city of Darwin in a very impressive sequence.<br /><br />Luhrmann paints his story on a broad canvas and, in general, he succeeds.  However, I think that he should have rearranged the structure of the last 15-20 minutes of his film, because, as it now stands, the final confrontation with the story's lead heavy comes off as anti-climatic.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Taking a nap would be a much more satisfying way to spend 84 minutes. At least, you won't wake up feeling like you've been robbed of a piece of your life. This movie is REALLY BAD, HORRIFICALLY BAD. In fact, we're having a hard time coming up with the last time we saw a movie this bad. I see people, who thought this movie was an accurate portrayal of behavior that you'd see during an apocalyptic-type disaster -- seriously?! I didn't see any footage, hear, or read any stories of people acting this mentally challenged during 9/11. Let's hope that during such a disaster, real people won't demonstrate Darwin's theory in action by showing how the unfit remove themselves from the gene pool. The movie is full of unknown actors for a reason. The first third to half of the movie is a pathetic attempt to build suspense by wasting time with the irrelevant drama of the dating lives of a bunch of 20-somethings at a not-remotely believable \\"going away party\\" -- unrequited lust, ambivalence, love triangles, childhood sweethearts, no character depth, no one at all to care about in this low-budget sad excuse for a horror flick, and no suspense or thrill whatsoever. Some blithering idiot is handed a camcorder to record the guests' last good-byes and well-wishes to the guest of honor. Unfortunately, you end up having to watch the entire movie through the shaky lense of the camcorder held by this ignoramous, who'll inflict his kindergarten observations upon you throughout, making you wish he were the \\"token black guy,\\" who gets eaten in the first 15 minutes. Wait. There is no \\"token black guy!\\" Why not? Some silly formula could've helped this train wreck.  The most horrific thing about this movie is the blabbering numbskull with the camcorder. Really?? The WHOLE movie through a shaky handheld camcorder?! As with the victims of this C-rater, you spend 84 minutes wondering what the heck just happened, and never really knowing. A preposterous rescue and glimpses of what's coming to get them are so cartoonish and lame that we would've been better left wondering, imagining what it was, and flat dialogue such as, \\"What was that?\\"  \\"Something terrible. Don't look at it.\\"  \\"What was that??\\"  \\"Also, something terrible. Don't look at that, either,\\" make you wish the whole cast had met their distrastrous fate 70 minutes earlier, if not sooner. Not scary. Not funny. 84 minutes we'll never get back. Glad we didn't pay to see this on the silver screen. Don't buy. Don't press play. Gratuituous blood & gore can't even save this one.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This is the saddest movie you're likely to see ever, not so much for the wrenching intimate tragedy it portrays but for the historical reality that it epitomizes. Could you possibly make sense of this film if you knew nothing at all about the mass murder of Jews in Hitler's Germany and the lands that Germany occupied? I don't think so! Fortunately, there are few people that ignorant of history alive right now, although there are a vicious few who deny it. Clearly, this is a film not just about two boys but also about the species that labels itself scientifically as Homo sapiens -- \\"Human knowing\\".<br /><br />Having survived 60% of the Twentieth Century, I can testify that it was the most tragic on record. Yeah, yeah, we were born with higher life expectancies and we had shinier toys. But it was the century of mass murder, conducted by the polity that we had supposedly evolved to manage our savagery. The most extensive mass murders were generated by ideologies wrapped in racism and nationalism, and sometimes sheathed with phony science. Do I need to indict the murderers here? Nearly all of Europe, even including France, had temporary governments that helped Hitler murder Jews. Stalin's USSR murdered uncountable millions. Cambodia. Uganda. Rwanda. Chile. Argentina, El Salvador and more ... murderous governments. Those rabid denouncers of the national/federal government of the USA should take note: though racism and xenophobia and fanaticism thrived in the USA also in the 20th C, the federal government never fell into the paws of the mass murderers. In fact, though the feds were guilty of segregationist behavior and repression of some forms of thought, much more obviously the federal government took effective measures to moderate the racist behaviors of state governments and of \\"us the People.\\"<br /><br />What does this have to do with a movie review? Everything! Because this movie made me think of history at every frame. It also made my wife cry on my shoulder disconsolately, and it made my teenage son turn off his laptop and stop wise-cracking for the rest of the evening. If you haven't already been informed of the scenario, here it is: Bruno's father, an ambitious and convinced Nazi military officer, is appointed to command a \\"work camp\\" -- really a death camp -- in a remote rural area. He takes his family there. His 8-year-old son, Bruno, finds a way to sneak out of the safe but boring home compound. Bruno finds the fence that surrounds the imprisoned Jews and makes contact with a boy his age, in a striped uniform that Bruno takes for pajamas. Sitting on opposite sides of the barbwire, the two naive boys form a bond....<br /><br />Some reviewers have objected that the boy Bruno, the central character, was implausibly naive, even for a pampered and protected eight-year-old. But the boy is something bigger than a single child; he's a synecdoche of the Germans (and Americans!) who \\"didn't know\\" and couldn't believe and perhaps couldn't care enough until it was too late. I suppose I'm taking the film as an allegory.<br /><br />Bruno's father and grandfather, seemingly decent men committed to duty and patriotism, are in fact \\"whited sepulchers\\" of ideology gone mad. They are surely Goldhagen's \\"willing executioners.\\" The mother and grandmother are shown to be conscience-stricken, but they too are executioners, unwilling if you want to defend them, but guilty of passivity.  Once again thinking allegorically, I'm tempted to see all of Germany's postwar agony on the faces of the horrified parents.<br /><br />If this movie seems more to you than an evening's vicarious 'entertainment,' I suggest that you get acquainted with the books of W. G. Sebald, especially \\"Austerlitz\\" and \\"The Emigrants.\\" Sebald is postwar Germany's greatest writer and most profound analyst of guilt.made my teenage son turn off his laptop and stop wise-cracking for the rest of the evening.

They are surely Goldhagen's \\"willing executioners.\\" The mother and grandmother are shown to be conscience-stricken, but they too are executioners, unwilling if you want to defend them, but guilty of passivity.  Once again thinking allegorically, I'm tempted to see all of Germany's postwar agony on the faces of the horrified parents.     If this movie seems more to you than an evening's vicarious 'entertainment,' I suggest that you get acquainted with the books of W. G. Sebald, especially \\"Austerlitz\\" and \\"The Emigrants.\\" Sebald is postwar Germany's greatest writer and most profound analyst of guilt.
B000002U94|5.0|An absolute must if you like Bob Seger.  Had it in vinyl and now in CD.  No person looking for best of rock and roll should not own this great piece of Live music.
1582701709|5.0|I have know for sometime something of this nature existed. \\"THE SECERET' brought it all together.

B001EOQWF8|1.0|This was a big let down for us.  My 5 year old son just didn't care for it and found it boring, he has not asked to watch it again.  I think he got a couple laughs near the start and that was about it    I honestly came to the same conclusion as we sat through this movie, it was a slow moving movie and just wasn't very entertaining and the underlying story wasn't anything new.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This movie is one of my most favorite movies of all time on many different levels.  Enough said.
0061122416|4.0|I knew before I started reading The Alchemist by Paulo Coeho that there were lessons to learn so I paid close attention to the words on the first several pages. Then I relaxed into his simple, almost clipped writing style and began to enjoy the journey of Santiago, the shepherd, as he pursued his Personal Legend and a mysterious treasure thought to be in a foreign land. Along the way he met many people who helped point him in the direction of his quest. As Santiago faced the challenges of his journey, he had to decide whether to continue to seek a larger fortune or stay in the security of the life he already knew.    No one knows in advance what the treasure is, or if Santiago will be able to surmount the obstacles along the way. But as he proceeded, he learned new lessons such as \\"we all come from the same source\\" and \\"listen to your heart.\\" What starts out as a journey to find worldly goods turns into a discovery of the treasures found within. The story of Santiago is an eternal testament to the transforming power of our dreams and the importance of listening to our hearts. The author's writing style seems simple but this rather small book carries a lot of messages to help each of us realize our own Personal Legend.    I found Paulo Coelho's novel to be rich with inspiring wisdom. I hope that you, too, will enjoy The Alchemist.
0061245097|5.0|I read through this book in a day... It is action packed with some really funny dark humor... BONES and CAT are truely meant for each other... This series has not disappointed me yet! can't wait for the next in the series!!
B000059T00|5.0|Blind Faith only lasted for one release, but the union of Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood produced memorable classic moments.  The opening tune, \\"Had to Cry Today\\" is a great rocker which features Steve's soaring vocals against the guitar play of Winwood and Clapton.  Ginger Baker's drumming is his usual thumping triplet rolls that became such a staple influence of rock drummers.  \\"Presence of the Lord\\", \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" are classic rock standards, and Winwood paints a poignant vocal line on both.  I am especially fond of the cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Well Alright\\", which provides an alternate take from the original.  This version is so great, it was the basis of the Santana cover years later.  This is a great disk that includes two additional long lost nuggets. Enjoy this cover to cover.
0783225482|5.0|This movie was really good. Wish things like that could really happen. everyone could be a brand-new person. worth watching and buying
B00026WU82|5.0|This is one of the great albums of all time.  Dylan wails against his newly found electric backing band, showcasing a different style from the protest folk tunes made him famous.  Rockers like \\"Tombstone Blues\\", \\"From a Buick 6\\", and the title song with its dialogue between God and Abraham are classic rock standards that stand the test of time.  \\"Ballad Of a Thin Man\\" is a slow ballad with heavy handed piano where Dylan laughs joyously at his command of illiteration. \\"It's a Lot to Laugh/It Takes a Train to Cry\\" is a great song with another unusual title. \\"Queen Jane Approximately\\" follows suit with Dylan's songwriting style at that time. Dylan stays true to his roots with the closer, \\"Desolation Row\\", which paints a bleak picture with protest song elements. This is a wonderful release.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|The inspiration for this movie was the New York Times Bestseller, Stardust by Neil Gaiman; however, the book and movie are really two different story lines with very little overlap.  I watched the movie first and then read Gaiman's book and I much prefer the movie version (which is unusual for me since I usually prefer a book's version over a movie's).  The director, casting, screenplay, actors, special effects, editing, costumes and make-up are outstanding.  It has a PG-13 rating but any risque comments would be over the head of a young child and the fantasy violence would really not be upsetting to children--I would give it a G rating for viewing by General Audiences.  It is a pure delight to watch, is humorous and I much prefer the movie's ending to the one in the book.  Suspend disbelief, believe in magic and be transported with this magical, wonderful movie.
B000002GKT|5.0|This is one of the greatest live performances from start to finish.  Steve Marriot screams his head off from the first number, with incredible vocal rave ups between the numbers that showcase his incredible range.  The guitar playing is crisp, with leads by a young Peter Frampton, who adds his own background vocals to Marriot's wail, and takes the lead on the Ray Charles tune, \\"Halliluja I Just Love Her So\\".  The versions of \\"Four Day Creep\\", \\"I'm Ready\\" (Willie Dixon's classic), and \\"I  Don't Need No Doctor\\" (a Frampton live staple, even today) rip through your speakers.  Play this one loud, like Humble Pie did that night at the Filmore.  This is live heavy performance that is classic.
0671015206|5.0|This book is a study of self-made millionaires.  It covers everything, how they buy their cars, the cost of a pet or a smoking habit.  I had read the book when it first came out and I bought a copy for the school library.
0525951113|1.0|I bought this book because the first two to three chapters were interesting and introduced a possibly plausible concept.  But the book quickly deteriorated from there, becoming first not credible and then downright stupid.  There is no character development and really no ascertainable plot, and certainly no explanation as to why the government was so secretive, despite the widespread effects, and powerless in the face of the threat.  There is no explanation given or even a rational surmise as to why the Daemon programmer infiltrated the government's top secret location, so he could basically play computer games with the other gamers.  I previously thought that Lee Child was the worst author out there, but this one wins that race hands down.  I only wish I could get my money back.  What a waste.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|This album is not one to ROCK out to. It's one to sit, relax, and enjoy. Plans just might be Death Cab's best album
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was probably one of the best books I have ever read.  I usually read fiction, but was interested in this as my husband was in the Navy flight program.  He was always fascinated with the Seal program and actually one of the guys who went through flight training with him, ended up in the Seal program and became an Admiral.  I am so glad I read this book.  We all need to applaud all of these men for what they did and do.  Hooray to you Marcus Luttrell and every Seal that ever existed.  Thank you for writing this incredible book.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We had so much fun playing this game around Christmastime, so I bought one for our house and the fun continues! Highly recommended!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have used several workout dvd's and this is by FAR the best one I have ever done. I have only been doing this for about two weeks, but can already see a change, especially in my arms. This is NOT an easy workout. But if you follow the moves and give 110%, at the end of the 20 minutes you will have really accomplished something that WILL change your body!     Pros: only equipment needed is hand weights, 3-2-1 routine makes the time go by quickly and keeps you from getting bored (Each level has 3 circuits of: 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs as well as a warm up and cool down)    Cons: Hard to come up with any but the one thing that does annoy me is that you have to listen to a lot of talking that you are not able to fast forward through before you can get to the actual workouts. It was good the first time, but I really don't need to hear it every day :)
B0013FNC38|3.0|i could listen to his voice and his music all day...  i wish he had a different writer, tho, as the words just don't do it for me...  must be an age thing...
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I thought this album was really good.  I've loved Chris since the Audioslave days.  Timbaland didn't do a bad job with the production of this album.  But I do think a producer like Ton3x would've been better.  Ton3x's always shown versatile skills in his own projects.  The only complaint I have about the album is that alot of the songs do sound a bit similar.  But all in all, it's a good album.  So if you're a REAL MUSIC LOVER, and can listen to this album with an open mind, forgetting the mental trappings of who you THINK Chris Cornell is, then I highly recommend this album.  Alot of people complain that there's only synthesized instrumentation in this album.  But don't believe people's opinions.  Buy the album and take a listen, look at the credits.  There's plenty of live guitar as well as drums and bass in this album.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I love this controller, it's got a great general feel to it. The heft is perfect, and I love the button scheme, including the trigger style buttons for R2/L2. The rumble is phenomenal, and the controller is still very comfortable for those long gaming sessions. Works perfectly as my PS3 Remote while I'm watching media through it.    My only problem is that it sometimes seems like the batteries don't hold a charge for the longest time, but with the ability to plug this in to any USB device (Namely my Macbook which is often nearby) and have it charge from there while still using it is helpful to maintaining the wireless capabilities!    --DSchmeling

B001P3SA94|4.0|As with many pop music history enthusiasts looking forward to this film I myself was up and rearing to go when it finally came out on DVD.I mean Adrian Brody,Jeffrey Wright?MAN it had the makings for a classic and Beyonce',someone I feel suffers from mass self imposed over exposure,actually got me interested to see her performance as Etta James,even if obviously she is very wrong for the film in terms of waistline. So.....my dad rented it and decided after watching it,while it had it's good points it pressed the point of racial violence a little too heavy for his book;there is one scene here that is particularly unpleasant but I decided to give the DVD a whirl myself. Well...the violence didn't upset me as much as another point made by reviewers this doesn't have 100% historical accuracy. Then again......neither did other music doc's I've loved such as [[ASIN:B00005NSXV The Temptations]]. What you'll see in this movie is how the rough and tumble lives of these early R&B and rock n roll pioneers such as Muddy Waters,performed wonderfully by Wright but also Willie Dixon,Howlin' Wolf and of course Beyonce's Etta. Of course the character who gets the most sketched out is Columbus Short,a great actor as well as Little Walter,a character whose short fuse and self victimizing nature get's the most overall screen time hear and results in many the films most \\"R\\" rated moments.Whereas everyone else pretty much underplayed their roles. The films plot revolved primarily around the personal and professional tentions as Cedric The Entertainer as Dixon provides the occasional narration,all while music history is being made and rock n roll history is being created from the ground up as various blues styles are clashing with electricity and post war cultural standards are changing all the roles.I would've preferred to see more of that history making aspect played up.But this was a story about the people.That brings me to the main thing that may either draw you to or away from this;there's an undercurrent of negativity to this as civil rights and personal struglles are the main focus and the emphasis tend to be on mainly on the beginning of the whole \\"sex,drugs and rock n roll\\" aspects of the culture. Just a look at how the history of Chuck Berry,performed in a great puckish way by Mos Def and Etta James. Strangly where it should be intense the film ebbs;the lead character of the factually barnstorming Leonard Chess (whose brother Phil isn't even mentioned here,not to mention Chess staple Bo Diddly) is portrayed too nuanced by Brody.Not to knock a good actor but the role required a lot more emotionalism and loudness then it was given.But that may be picking nits. Many musical biopics such as this have taken huge factual leaps for the same of dramatic content. Sometimes it utterly ruins the film,sometimes it almost saves it and other times no one's going to give a care. With me it's 50/50.While I'd have loved to see an honest,fact based story about this subject there's always going to be the \\"entertainment factor\\" of the old Hollywood clishe. So it's good for what it is but for a truly accurate and often very entertaining look at the real history of Chess Records look for the PBS documentary 'Record Row:The Cradle Of Rhythm & Blues',narrated by Etta James herself.I have it on VHS but if you didn't happen to catch it-it's pretty rare these days,this will have to do.r away from this;there's an undercurrent of negativity to this as civil rights and personal struglles are the main focus and the emphasis tend to be on mainly on the beginning of the whole \\"sex,drugs and rock n roll\\" aspects of the culture.

B001P5Q6F2|5.0|I think this album is amazing.  I enjoy listening to every song that is included on the album.  The guitars sounds great!  The producers album is also a bonus because I play guitar, so it's pretty cool playing along with the drums to any song that I like.
B001LRJH0K|1.0|while it looked awesome in previews, the film did not at any part live up to my expectations. I found the dialogue dry and boring. The actors chemistry was poor, God knows viggo tried. The plot was horribly predictable and action scenes few and far between. I wouldnt even advise renting it.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! Jared Leto, though an excellent musician in the groundbreaking band 30 Seconds To Mars, is a horrible actor! Ellen Burstyn, or whatever her name is, is a terrible old hack of an actress. She should be in a freaking retirement home. Jennifer Connelly is pretty awful too. The plot is boring, generic and full of Hollywood cliches. The only redeeming qualities are that Jared Leto looked totally hot and luckily realized how horrible of an actor he is so he moved on to music and made great albums.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|i dont have any review for this film cause everything already been said about this masterpiece it gets 5 stars...i just ask to release new copies of this special collectors edition because i dont want to buy it used and i heard really good reviews about the special collectors edition and how it is better then the 10th year edition-so i want it new,in good quality without any bootlegs or whatever and dont forget to put english subtitles and pleaseeeee sell it in reasonable price! cause im sure im gonna buy it.  so amazon if u read this review of mine i would be happy if u will release new copy of this 3 disc collectors edition-thankssssssssssssssss
1401902197|5.0|Forget spending thousands of dollars on pycho babble books.  This woman is REAL.  She speaks directly and from experience.  There is not a single person on this planet who can't benefit from her wisdom.  The audio that comes with the book is brilliant.  It's the most benefical purchase I've made in a very long time.
158049594X|5.0|I chose this and other Touchstone Classic books for my 8 year-old, because it is the original, unabridged version.  At these low prices, this is a good opportunity to expose your children to literature.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This video brings back memories from when I was a kid wishing Disney would go back to making cartoons the old fashion way. I really enjoyed the way Fantasia uses classical music to introduce to children all ages. This movie/cartoon is a great way to show children how cartoons were like back in the days. All in all I'm very happy for being able to find it on DVD and share it with my family.
031606792X|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this one after hearing some people say they didn't like it.  I was thrilled to find out that I couldn't disagree more.  I loved it all, every page of it.  I thought I'd hate having to read through the vampire fight scene but instead I found myself glued to it.  I thought it was a nice finish to the story, and I am so sad there are no more.  I hope Midnight Sun gets published at some point, I'd love to see the story from Edward's eyes.  I read all 4 books in about 12 days, which isn't easy for a mom with 5 children to find the time to do but I spent many late nights reading with the quiet time I had.  I guess I should be happy I'll get to sleep earlier again, but I'm not.  I'd really rather be reading the Twilight books.

B001CQONKY|2.0|Please read carefully. I purchased this dvd from a third party. This makes it difficult to determine if I would say the following had I purchased direct from Amazon. The season had struggles due to the writers strike. The first three discs are episodes that had been repeated during the strike, then the quality of those discs are remarkably different than the remaining discs, they are grainy and unpleasant to watch.  I question if the \\"new, never used\\" description meant???there will be downloads, copies, etc.I should have known..the third party would not reply to my email inquiry..asking exactly that information. CSI's STORY QUALITY remains pristine. I waited a long time before buying the 8th season. At the very least I have the complete collection. Let's hope season 9 will hold up.  P.J.Today

0739499424|5.0|This book encompasses all Jane Austen's published stories in paperback form.  Very convenient but may be hard for an elderly person to hold the book.
0060849827|5.0|This gem is as good as the other reviewers say.  I won't repeat their observations here.  Please note, in case you missed it in the product description (like I did), that this is the \\"pocket\\" edition of the book.  It measures about 3 by 4 inches, and the type is very, very small.  The small size makes it handy to tuck in a backpack, but be aware that the type is truly tiny.  There is a full size (4x8 inch) version of this same book, although it seems to be available only through third parties.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I found this item to be in very good condition and no defect when I watched the DVD
B0013FXWU6|1.0|.......or, at the very least, underground---which is where we first see the main character of this film.    What a perfectly bad idea:  to produce a motion picture about an absolutely miserable old fart of a man who makes every life with which he comes in contact even more scabrous than his own.    One-Star to D. D. Lewis for stunningly bringing to life for us someone who better never to have existed.  Yes, this is just the type person expensive movies should put out there for us.    ****
0307387178|4.0|In Krakauer's first adventure book, Into the Wild, he depicts a young man striving to renounce the standard way of settling down for life by living the life of a vagabond traveller and adventurer.  The account is based on the real life of Chris McCandless and, like his other books, provides for an amazing biographical chronicle of an interesting adventure scenario.    I did not find Into the Wild as engaging or intriguing as Into Thin Air, but as any young man interested in adventure would agree, the book teased a basic manly dare to go out into the unknown alone.  McCandless is both hailed for his boldness and bashed for his ignorance.  The conflicting duality of that plot makes it difficult to choose a side.    Thus, while it is easy to read and learn due to the subject of the book, the bouncing back and forth between sides makes it a bit tough to read completely smoothly from an emotional standpoint.  Also, due the \\"reckless idiot\\" standpoint of of McCandless, the book is not inspirational in the sense that I wanted to drop everything and head \\"into the wild\\".    I cannot finish of the review on a negative note, however.  Krakauer is an incredible author and the vocabulary and elegance of his words make this a fantastic book.  Fortunately, Krakauer found even better martyr's and heroes in his later works.
B0007TKNKG|4.0|Feel the innocent charme of the 1980's while watching this misunderstood little movie. It is a nice father-and-son story, told in the unique Stallone-style, which, if you like it, is evergreen and simple. Not an action movie, and in contrast to many people's opinion, Stallone CAN act, just in a more subtle way. Anyway, this is a fans-only item. Enjoy!
B00122BEYG|2.0|I wasn't a big fan of this album when it came out. I remember renting(library had huge cd collections) and thinking it wasn't really that great. Music was kind of ugh? I was like it's ok but way too overplayed. Don't tell me was the only song i really liked,but didn't get to hear enough of on the radio. Other then that I thought runway lover was decent. i thought what it feels like for a girl was pretty lame and boring. She doesnt have great vocals so for me it wasn't that great. I would skip this cd. It's def. not her best. She really should have gone in more of a kylie minogue direction.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Lester (Kevin Spacey) is middle aged and living what on the outside looks like a perfect life. Big house in a nice neighborhood, 2 cars, pretty wife and daughter, and a good job. But on the inside, he's miserable. His job sucks and he has to answer to a younger boss that hasn't even been there a few months. His wife is cold `b' and doesn't even want to have sex with him. His daughter hates him for reasons unknown. And he just really doesn't even like himself that much either. Then one day, he goes to a basketball game with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) to watch his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) do her performance in her cheerleading squad. That day changes his life on the spot. He sees Angela (Mena Suvari), Jane's friend, out on the court also, and he realizes his life is in a rut and he wants to be free from it. He quits his job and starts to work out again (mainly to get Angela's attention). He sells his car to get the car of his dreams. And he starts to smoke pot.<br /><br />Luckily his new next door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is a pot dealer. Not only a pot dealer but a weird documentarian that goes to school with Jane. Ricky's dad is a tough father who is also a homophobic Colonel in the marine corp. He loves his son, but sure doesn't know how to show it correctly. Though Ricky and Jane start to like each other, the interactions between Ricky and Lester leave the dad to wondering what is really going on between the two.<br /><br />Carolyn, though a coldhearted `B', used to not be what she is today. She was once a fun loving free spirited girl, but Lester has no clue where that girl went. She's so wrapped up in her real estate business she doesn't even think of Lester anymore. Her arch nemesis in the biz is Buddy Kane, and even though she tries her best to beat the man, nothing works and it makes her incredibly stressed out.  As Lester is trying to work out his mid-life crisis, his wife Carolyn is working out her stress in a much different way.<br /><br />American Beauty is such a great movie. The way it looks into the soul of the normal suburbanite family is really funny and great. Nothing is perfect no matter how it looks. Somedays I really feel like Lester even though I'm not married or have kids. Where I'm just stuck doing the same thing every day and then `BAM', I go a little crazy and break out of that shell. I've even quit my job before because of this. Thank God to, because now I'm much happier. Though you can't help but feel bad for Lester. At least I do. He did so much to support his family, to have them only hate him in the end. Sure he's not always there for his daughter, but that's no reason to be hated. She actually joked about killing him. Seriously... what the heck. Her life could be a million times worse. And his wife, ugh, I'm not even going to go into it. How a woman could do what she does to him is ridiculous. And even though Ricky Fitts is friggin crazy, he's still a cool character. I don't buy into that whole `deep' and `emo' stuff he says about floating bags and dead people/animals, but how he's so blunt about things makes me really like that character.<br /><br />In the end, I would definitely watch this movie. Such a great story, and such a sad ending.<br /><br />P.S. - I really hope Angela was 18.such a great movie. The way it looks into the soul of the normal suburbanite family is really funny and great.

B000BZISTE|1.0|I recently rented this DVD to share with my 18 year old son. While I can see how this film made such an impact, I did not find it to be a comedy, though I remembered it as being very funny when it first came out. My son did not see the humour in this movie either. I thought the treatment of women was horrific and I hope things have changed for women in the army since then.   My husband who was a nurse in Viet Nam said the doctors in his unit must have taken this movie to heart since they tried to act as the doctors in MASH. The nurses were not amused then and my family is not amused by this movie now.

But, The Creator of Stich, Jumba, and Sidekick Plickly Are On The Search of Finding Stitch and Bringing Him Back To The Grand Concil in Space. Lilo,Stitch, and Nani Must Stop From The Aliens From Taking Stitch Back To Space and Making Sure He Stays With Them.    I've Never Seen A Film So Magical, Thrilling, and Origanal Scince Spielberg's E.T., Lilo and Stitch is One of Those Films You Can Watch Over and Over Again and Can Never Ever Get Tired of It. One of The Best Things About This Film is The Various Elvis Songs in The Film and I Plan To Get The Soundtrack Sometime. Another Great Thing About The Film is Its Animation, Even Though It's 2D Animation, It's Absolutly Realistic, and Belivable.

B001PE26QQ|5.0|A great movie for anyone, especially those interested in martial arts.  Ip Man, the legendary teacher of Bruce Lee, is represented here as a humble, yet highly capable Wing Chun kung fu master.  Brilliantly choreographed fight scenes throughout the film make it very entertaining to watch, as you follow Ip Man through some of the most significant moments of his young life.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I was very pleased with this boxed set. It was very enjoyable to catch up on all the Indiana Jones movies.  I had not seen either the Raiders or the Temple of Doom movies in quite some time, and look forward to the times I will want to review one or more and have the convenience of having them all available.  The quality was first-rate, and the delivery was quicker than I had expected.  I will be pleased to make future orders with Amazon and Jim's Videos.
0451196716|1.0|The Long Walk is very formalaic and predictable. It's obvious that the first-person narrator is going to survive, so there is really no suspense. The reader simply plods along with the walkers, waiting for the next one to die.  The narrator's emotional defeat, despite having won the walk, was predictable.  It was like \\"so what?\\"  This was not Stephen King, or Richard Bachman if you will, at his best.

0671004107|5.0|Well, I am positive it has all been said before but I loved this book. Sci-Fi isn't really my thing, I usually prefer autobiographies and real life stories but the movie version of this book with Jodie Foster blew me away. I saw it years ago, and I just picked up this book 2 weeks ago. I just finished reading it earlier today... Jesus, where should I start?  The character of Ellie Arroway was amazing... So many things about this book are just so great. Gilgamesh, chapter 22 is in my opinion the best chapter of the book... I won't give it away, but I will say that I would love to do what Hadden did lol BUY THIS BOOK!!! you will not be disappointed, I promise...<br /><br />I will say this though, it isn't perfect. It had some dull parts like when Carl decided it was a good idea to go pages describing in great detail the history of a minor character or two, but don't let that turn you off, it is a great book.... I didn't understand alot of the math though, but I loved it anyway... lol
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I first saw this in the theater with a couple friends, I was gripping the seat for most of it, it's not scary but I didn't expect it to be, or any movie these days......  Anyway, I loved the way it was filmed, My friends did not, either of them, the one had to look away to prevent any motion sickness and didn't know what was going on. The other was busy playing with him self because he could not pay attention.    But I still can't say enough good things about this, it is an all around great film, I have the DVD(Steelbook), but now also Blu-ray. That makes it way better, improved lighting and sound, and watching it in Blu-ray relieves a major part of the motion sickness........if you get that, I for one do not.    If you hate movies filmed this shaky camera way but love big monsters, rent the Blu-ray only and see what you think.

And they said they would refund my shipping cost.  Within a week, i had my brand new case and DVD's in perfect condition, and a credit to my charge for the postage I paid to send it back.  There was ABSOLUTELY no hassle!!  Really enjoyed doing business with Astro Video and have really enjoyed my new DVD set!!!  And on top of that...the DVD's were so much cheaper than in the stores!!!  Thank You Astro!!!!
B00005JPAO|3.0|I missed this film when it showed locally.  I have waited and waited to view it. Finally got the idea of ordering it on line.  Was pleased to find it at reazonable price on Amazon.  Finally viewed it the other night.  I was a bit disappointed in the film.  Hadn't realized it was about the death of Diana and the poor light deservably cast upon the Queen because of her cold reaction to Diana's death.  I like Helen Mirren very much, but didn't think her role in this film deserved the award it received.  Sorry Helen!  Mahala H., Miami, FL
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This is one of the few movies that I view multiple times (6 to be precise). Downey steals the show here with his portrayal of the hippest brother ever to grace the screen: \\"I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude.\\"  Please rent this if you like to laugh. One of the few films that get funnier with multiple viewings as you begin to appreciate the incredible subtleties and genius of Downey's performance.  The guy is simply more black than black dudes! The portrayal is done with taste and I hope it is not offensive considering the legacy of blackface.  It would be a shame if someone was hurt by this film.    Downey deserved the Oscar for this instead of Ledger.  It is much more difficult to portray someone when the audience has a frame of reference (a black dude), as opposed to Ledger's obscure portrayal of a psychopath. Ledger had the luxury of playing that role however he saw fit, and we would never know if he was off the mark or not.  If Downey's performance was off, it would have failed miserably.
B001NCM98U|5.0|The first time I heard of Keane, their new album Perfect Symmetry was featured on NPR.  I picked up that album and I love it - rated it a 5 here on Amazon.  However, P.S. is rated relatively poorly and at first I couldn't really understand why, since it's fun, poppy, energetic, and very enjoyable.  After getting Hopes and Fears and listening through this, I get it.  If people had gotten to know Keane as a band that put out music of this depth, beauty, and complexity, Perfect Symmetry would be a let down.    Every few days a new track surfaces as my current favorite... I know I'm just throwing my voice to the chorus of praises here, but this album is brilliant.
B00009P1MP|5.0|March 17, 2008<br />I first became aware of a journeyman folk singer named Don McLean about 40 years ago. I lived then in New York City with my folks about two blocks from an estuary known as the Hudson River. The river had a ravaging current and old men would lean on the rails and fish for eels all day. Up river past the GW bridge Pete Seeger,a well displayed folk singer and environmentalist was busy shaping up his magnificent ship, The Clearwater. The young man, an aspiring folksinger, Don McLean was sort of like an apprentice or protege. Basically, over the years, although Don has written and performed such beautiful and jewel like songs such as Vincent and Castles in the Air, the timeless monster American Pie was not only his signature but because it was so big a hit on top forty, we must not forget that he also as a singer songwriter, gave the listeners much more. There was no Sirius-XM then to pick up the slack. American Pie was catchy but also complex. It dwells on that frigid day in North Dakota when Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Richey Valens met their demise in a small silver plane on a snowy, crystallized and iced over meadow as the cub went down. Buddy would tell Waylon Jennings to take the bus because he had a cold.Otherwise we would never have had outlaw country. I will tell you this, even if you are not old enough to remember this and I will bet you are not, try this CD anyway. Don McClean does not disappoint and if he were in a position to start his career today with what we have electronically I think that he would be exceedingly big. This is what retrograb is all about.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|I missed Australia in the theaters, so I pre-ordered the DVD (thru Amazon).  The first time I watched Australia, I was somewhat disapointed,   however, I watched it again, and truly enjoyed it.  I think the editing was not the best, there were scenes that went on too long, and then it was like Baz Luhrman ran out of time, and then bunched all of the last third of the movie scenes (which were terrific) together.  The storyline was very choppy, and I had to go back & watch the movie again to understand how everything fit together.  This movie is becoming one of my favorites, Nicole Kidman did a great job as the uptight Lady Sarah, who becomes human as the movie progresses. Hugh Jackman was wonderful & compassionate as The Drover.  The young actor, Brandon Waters, in my opinion, stole the show, he was wonderful.    This movie is a keeper, just watch it several times to pick up everything in the movie.

B000E1155O|5.0|Sibylle Baier's Colour Green is an album of pensive and deeply moving songs and sweet, happy, infectious ones. Her lyrics are beautiful and poetic and the images, emotions, and concepts she evokes are often profound (particularly in the album's standout track \\"I Lost Something In the Hills). The music enhances her lyrics perfectly and have a great, unique, and moving aesthetic.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say as I'm not writing very well today, but definitely give this album a chance. If you like anything at all similar you'll love this.

1416594884|5.0|I have many \\"favorite authors.\\" In the genre of spy novels, John Le Carre stands at the top of the pantheon of very good writers. This Oxford graduate brings an elegance and panache to the world of espionage that few other writers have been able to match. Over the years, I think I have read most of his novels, and seen the movies that have been made based on his works - \\"Russia House,\\" \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,\\" \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" to name a few.<br /><br />With his latest novel, \\"A Most Wanted Man,\\" he adds a nice exclamation point to an already stellar career.<br /><br />This was what he had to say when he had finished the process of creating this work:<br /><br />\\"Dear Reader,<br /><br />New spies with new loyalties, old spies with old ones; terror as the new mantra; decent people wanting to do good, but caught in the moral maze; all the good, sound, rational reasons for doing the inhuman thing; the recognition that we cannot safely love, or pity, and remain good `patriots' - I'm pleased with the way this novel turned out.<br /><br />Best, John Le Carre\\"<br /><br />Turn out well it did.

B00003CX5P|1.0|My six-year-old had this on and I saw bits of it so I can't really say what it was about. He did like it and I suppose he's the target audience, but there's no excuse for any movie, even a kid's movie, being this lame. I somehow managed to mostly notice Natalie Portman. She's really pretty but what's with Lucas and the hairdos? Remember Carrie Fisher's cinnamon buns in the first movie? Portman has many styles that are more like outlandishly elaborate pastries than hair. And honest to God, I did a better acting job in my 4th grade production of Sleeping Beauty in 1972, wearing my mother's nightgown as a fairy costume, than Portman does in The Phantom Menace. Like, what meds was she on? I'm happy for Ewan MacGregor and Liam Neeson that they got nice paychecks out of this as they have given many fine performances in lower-profile films, but the material here is so bad that even actors of their talents can do little. If your kids HAVE to watch this, find something else to do, in a galaxy as far, far away as possible.

1576754499|5.0|One of my favorite nonfiction books is Small Is Beautiful. I never thought I would find a book that I liked as much as that one for how to reduce poverty, but Small Is Beautiful has now been replaced by Paul Polak's Out of Poverty as a helpful guide for poverty elimination.<br /><br />I was drawn to the book by Susan Harrow's video of a talk by Dr. Polak, and I attended a recent presentation he made at MIT to learn more. Though trained as a psychiatrist, Dr. Polak appears to have been a thoughtful listener before he began to treat patients. That sincere interest in understanding the circumstances and perceptions of others has served him well in understanding the real and mental barriers that keep rural poor people who live on less than a dollar a day in income from lifting themselves out of poverty.<br /><br />In Out of Poverty, Dr. Polak summarizes what he has learned from in-depth conversations with over 3,000 poor people and in attempting to design and deliver products and services that would help them to earn more money from their existing resources. A key lesson that readers will learn is that each person's situation is different, and you cannot impose solutions from above. Instead, you should seek to take advantage of the hard work of poor people and their determination to survive and thrive (if possible).<br /><br />His overall model is to help rural poor (who are most of the poorest of the poor in the world) to grow high-priced items (such as out-of-season vegetables and fruits) that require lots of labor on tiny plots of land (scattered holdings that total an acre or less for a family). While the concept is simple, turning that concept into reality isn't. Farmers need to lift, store, and ration water carefully for dry seasons; avoid excess water in wet seasons; learn how to handle the new crops; find markets for what they produce; and be able to afford the investments required. Much of the book involves a single case history of a Nepalese farmer, Krishna Bahadur Thapa, and his family who attempt to follow this route.<br /><br />For poor people who live in slums, Dr. Polak has a parallel vision: Manufacture high quality items that wealthy people will want to purchase that require lots of low-cost labor. Here again, a lot of work needs to precede the solution: customers found, designs created, standards set, training provided, small factories established, suppliers qualified, financing made available, and market knowledge developed to shift into new opportunities.<br /><br />Dr. Polak also describes his past work with International Development Enterprises to design and deliver very low-cost treadle water pumps, drip irrigation systems, and water storage containers. He outlines his plans for a new organization, D-REV, which aims to increase the availability of designers and designs for solving the most pressing economic problems of the poorest people. The book outlines what some of those design needs are.<br /><br />For those who prefer conventional solutions such as massive international aid to developing countries, charity, extending the green revolution, advancing technology, and encouraging major corporations, Dr. Polak has bad news. Those efforts haven't worked, and they aren't likely to start working now. He also describes the inevitable failures of even the most humanely intended and thorough forms of assistance.<br /><br />Affordability of new options is the key. Poor people need to spend very little (ideally just a tiny bit more than they do now) to get a lot more income so that they get their money back in a few months. This might mean buying a treadle pump that will only last two years. But if it pays back in three months, they can afford to buy a better one in two years.<br /><br />These people are so poor that they cannot afford a drought or a flood that wipes out a crop year. As a result, they will not commit all of their scarce resources to an innovation. Even a good innovation will do them no good in a flood. As a result, they will starve or have to become beggars.<br /><br />If you really want to understand how you can help poor people, read and follow the advice in this book. Poor people will be glad that you decided to take the time to listen and act appropriately.<br /><br />Bravo, Dr. Polak!gars.    If you really want to understand how you can help poor people, read and follow the advice in this book. Poor people will be glad that you decided to take the time to listen and act appropriately.    Bravo, Dr. Polak!
B0015OKWL2|2.0|'Righteous Kill' represents a big foot forward for screenwriter Russell Gewirtz. Where Gewirtz's rookie effort, 'Inside Man', was a story about a bank heist that completely lacked credibility, the plot of 'Righteous Kill' actually is modestly clever. A vigilante serial killer is on the loose in New York City, murdering various criminals. His calling card is a rhymed poem left at each crime scene. De Niro (Turk) and Pacino (Rooster) play the two aging detectives assigned to solve the case. De Niro is seen throughout on a surveillance tape seemingly 'confessing' to committing the murders. But in a twist at the end of the story, his confession turns out to be forced and it ends up that Pacino is actually the murderer all along.<br /><br />Before arriving at the film's climax, we learn that Turk planted evidence on a murderer who got off on a technicality and as a result the criminal is sent off to jail. A good part of the movie chronicles how each of the bad guys are dispatched by the vigilante. The main bad guy is a drug dealer played by 50 Cent who is convincingly menacing. An early unconvincing scene involves Turk and Rooster sending a pretty coke-addicted lawyer to the drug dealer's lair, wearing a wire, and trying to entrap him. The drug dealer sees through the ruse right away and the lawyer is shot by the drug dealer's bodyguard (but eventually survives). Why veteran detectives would place an amateur informant in such easy jeopardy doesn't ring true. There's a subplot involving a sexy Crime Scene Investigator who is simultaneously bedding Turk and Perez, a younger detective (played by John Leguizamo). Perez and his partner Riley (played by Donnie Wahlberg) come to the conclusion that it's one of their own who has been committing the murders.<br /><br />Various posters here have pointed to deficiencies in the script including that De Niro and Pacino are too old for their parts, there's a lack of character development (too many good cop/bad cop clich&eacute;s), a lack of suspense and scenes that are repetitious. One poster suggested that the characters needed to have a softer side but I think it was the director's intent to keep the entire story as dark as possible. The constant use of the moody soundtrack throughout most of the film compensated for the lack of emotional depth of the characters. Was this a good thing? I don't know. But clearly the music added to the film's 'neo-noir' feel.<br /><br />'Righteous Kill' will probably do fairly well at the box office if one factors in the potential global market. This is really a noir version of 'Dirty Harry' and those who love having their stick-figure bad guys brought to justice without putting up a fight, will be drawn to his type of film. And then there's De Niro and Pacino. De Niro almost always channels the same character--a hot-headed gangster type (I was so much reminded of his performance in 'Analyze This', although that's a comedy). Moviegoers always want to pay money to see De Niro even though he usually coughs up the same shtick. Pacino however is much more subdued in this film until the end. Only then does he allow his over the top persona to come out. Actually that was the intent of the screenwriter; the audience is led to believe that De Niro is the hot head and Pacino is the reasonable one. Pacino keeps De Niro \\"in check' throughout the film until the ending.<br /><br />Although many claimed they 'figured out' the twist ending 30 minutes into the film, I must confess that I didn't see it coming. But once it was revealed I didn't really buy the reversal since it was inconsistent with the way the character arc had developed. Pacino's 'Rooster' has noble motives for offing the bad guys. But suddenly, when the sexy CSI gal is about to expose him, he viciously attacks her. It just seemed totally out of character for this noble 'Dirty Harry' character to suddenly decompensate and attack a woman. What 'noble' criminal would do such a thing? Rooster's explanation is thathe became disappointed with Turk after Turk planted evidence on the murderer who got off on a technicality. He had 'looked up' to Turk but now the image of him being a noble cop had been destroyed. Somehow he now becomes a vigilante serial killer because his partner no longer 'went by the book'. This is his explanation as to why he becomes unhinged which leads his partner of 30 years to shoot him to death. If you believe in this motive, then you'll believe that the portrait of the New York City Police Department as depicted in this film is a realistic one.<br /><br />When all is said and done, we never get a feel for Turk and Rooster as flesh and blood human beings. There is little 'back story' to 'Righteous Kill' and that applies to all the characters. 'Righteous Kill\\" remains a modestly entertaining detective mystery with little character development and chiefly relying on the hit or miss semi-comic banter between two aging Hollywood legends.ter Turk planted evidence on the murderer who got off on a technicality.

It plays in our machines, but makes a racket bouncing around in there.  Can't be good for the machine, may have toasted our home DVD player which has been acting up since.    One customer had gotten a copy which didn't work from an online rental company, so they came to our store looking for another that might play for them.  We couldn't help them.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|If you're the kind of fan that mostly likes \\"Enjoy the Silence\\", \\"Policy of Truth\\", and some of Depeche Mode's other singles then you may be disappointed. If you like the non-single tracks on any of their albums from \\"Some Great Reward\\" onward then you'll probably love this.     I decided it didn't make sense to just compare this to Depeche Mode's other albums (what worked decades ago doesn't work today, you know?) It made more sense to think of this ablum in the context of the music that was released in the same era as PTA.  I thought that some of the slower tracks sounded like if you mixed the mood of the more somber tracks of \\"Violator\\" or \\"Ultra\\" with the kind of experimentation found in Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\", e.g. some DM fans complained that this album sounded over-produced but if you like Radiohead at all then you'll like what they did here. The faster paced tracks were more like \\"Black Celebration\\" meets The Bravery.     Actually, the reason I decided not to compare this to, say, \\"Violator\\", was because this album is a complete departure from their previous albums (at least I thought so). Is that a bad thing? Of course not, this is a fantastic album in it's own right (in my opinion, it's as strong an album as \\"Violator\\", in fact it was better in some ways). The only tracks I wasn't crazy about were \\"The Sinner In Me\\" (it was okay but not great) and \\"Damaged People\\" (horrible, horrible song).     Some of the reviews state that this was \\"classic\\" Depeche Mode, but what does that mean exactly? \\"Classic\\" could mean that PTA has the same dance hall, techno-pop sounding tunes found in \\"Some Great Reward\\" or it could mean that this album is in some way a \\"Violator: Part Deux\\". Obviously, Depeche Mode's sound has evolved over time and to call this album \\"classic\\" can be misleading.  I just don't want someone that thinks \\"Black Celebration\\" is \\"classic\\" DM to expect PTA to be similar and be disappointed.    Not to harp on this, but you would be doing yourself a disservice if you listened to this once and decided to donate it to charity just because you were expecting to hear \\"Violator\\".  You might need to listen to this a couple of times and keep an open mind but this really is a great album.  It's just funny how some people expect a band to put out Violator clones for fifteen years and still remain relevant.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I love Chris Cornell and like all fans, I was shocked and appalled to hear that his new solo album was being produced by Timbaland, the producer behind recent hit albums by Nelly Furtado (NOT a fan) and Justin Timberlake (not REALLY a fan).     Chris Cornell has one of the greatest rock voices of all time and I've enjoyed his work in Soundgarden, Audioslave, and even his recent solo outings. I loved his previous solo album [[ASIN:B000PDZJ08 Carry On]], which touched on this kind of sound in songs like \\"Killing Birds.\\" After hearing the song \\"Scream\\" on TV, I held out some hope that \\"Scream\\" could be good. And it is, if looked at differently than it has.    Anyone expecting what they've heard from Cornell previously are going to be disappointed without a doubt. It's easy to say that it sounds like Cornell singing over Justin Timberlake-beats. Which, it kind of is. But, let us look at it for what it is. A catchy, beat-driving, club-oriented record. Cornell made the mistake of comparing this album to Queen's[[ASIN:B000000OAN A Night at the Opera]] and Pink Floyd's [[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side Of The Moon]] in the sense that the album has a continuous flow. Every song flows into each other...But, [[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side Of The Moon]] is a bit of a bold statement.    I like \\"Scream.\\" Do I like it more than previous efforts? No. Do I hope Cornell continues in this musical direction? Absolutely not. But this album is not without its good spots.    Any attempt to delve into the lyrical quality of this album would be futile. Even with the deepest lyrics, it would be hard to take them seriously in the context of these songs, but here's a quick song-by-song analysis of the album.    \\"Part of Me\\" is the most embarrassing song on the album. I personally never thought I'd hear Cornell singing \\"That b**** ain't a part of me,\\" but taking it for what it is, it's catchy...You'll skip it eventually though.  \\"Time\\" is a great song however, both poppy and featuring very well-producedvocals. It's not Pink Floyd's song, but it's still pretty good.  \\"Sweet Revenge\\" & \\"Get Up\\" are two of the weaker songs. \\"Sweet Revenge\\" has really embarrassing lyrics and a gay vocal effect in the chorus (\\"Sweeeeeeeeet...Revenge\\") and \\"Get Up\\" just doesn't stand out at all.  \\"Ground Zero\\" is a pretty damn good song, but Cornell's monkey noise begins to stick out and it may annoy you.  \\"Never Far Away\\" is a song custom-built for a nightclub, but it's one of my favorite songs on the album.  \\"Take Me Alive\\" shares lyrical themes with \\"Sweet Revenge,\\" and features backing vocals by Justin Timberlake...Lame.  \\"Long Gone\\" was the first song off this album that Cornell debuted on his myspace. I hated it, but it's grown on me. I do think the beginning sounds very similar to \\"My Love\\" by Timberlake however.  \\"Scream\\" is catchy as hell and his vocals sound great, despite the fact he seems like he's sleepwalking through some of it. Still one of my favorite songs on the album.  \\"Enemy,\\" \\"Other Side of Town,\\" and \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\" (not to be confused with the Radiohead song) are all pretty good. \\"Enemy\\" has well-produced vocals, \\"Other Side of Town\\" sounds WAY to JT influenced, but \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\" is pretty damn catchy.  Finally, you have \\"Watch Out\\" which is the worst song on the album, followed by a decent hidden track called \\"Two-Drink Minimum\\" which sounds more like [[ASIN:B00001QGL2 Euphoria Morning]] than anything.    One very positive thing I can say about this album is the job Timbaland did on producing his vocals. They sound more clear and pristine than they have in a while. If Timbaland produced the vocals (ONLY) on Cornell's other records, things would be nice.    Now, no one is going to throw out their old Soundgarden records over this...But, I think that we (as the fans) should take it for what it is.  Cornell will make another album within the next few years and I think it's a little too early to start labeling him a \\"sell-out.\\" This album  Hardly seems to be gathering him any new fans by any stretch of the imagination. There's no doubt he's succeeding in alienating more fans than he probably intended to, but there's no point in comparing this to previous efforts. It's good for what it is; a pop record in the vein of Justin Timberlake. As a Chris Cornell record, it's catchy and slightly embarrassing. I don't support Cornell continuing his career on this path, but this is a good, entertaining little album while I await his next ROCK masterpiece.    GRADE: B
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I heard about this DVD on NPR.  I like Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion, so I figured I'd give it a try.  It's really great!  It's corny and campy & touching & sweet.  The muscial commentary audio track is very funny.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a NPH, Nathan Fillion or Josh Whedon fan.
B001N3OCV6|4.0|Really like this music, besides the score... which I also loved, I really enjoyed the classic music through out the movie, again, its good to see included in this cd.
B0009JJMFQ|5.0|We received this as a gift, and thankfully so, because it's a bit pricey.  I won't dock the rating based on price, because my 2 y/o son LOVES this toy.     Because of its high-quality German construction and weight, I believe it will last a long time.  Even though it's (mostly) die-cast metal, I don't see any sharp edges or corners that could injure the child --- just don't let him throw it!  As I've said, it's heavy.  And just to be safe, your child should be beyond the \\"everything goes in the mouth\\" phase before you consider buying this toy.  Oh yeah, the plastic ramp on the trailer comes off easily.  Just take it off and put it away somewhere if you think your child will keep on taking it off.  The tires are rubber, but there is no sign that they'll easily come off.    It is small, but this makes it easy for a child to handle and carry it around.  I put some rice in a shoe-box lid and my son will entertain himself for a long time. (\\"Scoop rice!\\")  Although it's very portable, the price also means that you might hesitate to let it out of the house, lest you lose it!    One oddity with this toy is that the 'digger' is a little wider than the trailer bed.  Whether this is accurate to the real thing, I don't know, but this results in a problem with stability: the digger doesn't sit securely on the trailer.  A toddler can easily get frustrated (as my son does) when trying to 'transport' the digger on the lowboy.  The digger will fall off at 'higher speeds'.       Another problem, for toddlers again, is the way that the trailer attaches to the semi tractor.  The tractor and trailer must be at right angles for the hitch to insert into the hole.  Toddlers might not understand this and the frustration results (for the child and for the parent!).  But this is life.    As a daddy, I appreciate the realism of this toy.  The tires, joints and hydraulics look just like the real thing. (I know this because I've seen, uh, videos -- on YouTube.)  Even the wheel hubs have 'lug nuts' (tiny bumps, not actual separate parts). Overall, this toy is a winner.    P.S. If you want a dump truck to go with this, I recommend a the [[ASIN:B001SHYWM6 Mattel Matchbox 2008 MBX Construction 1:64 Scale Die Cast Metal Car # 67 - Red Dump Tanker Truck with Black Dumpster]].  But go to Walmart, where it costs $0.97 + tax.  I don't know why it's $9.99 (+ $5.10 S&H!?) here at Amazon.  It's lightweight, but it costs a fraction of the price of the [[ASIN:B000OZS9JK Volvo Dumper]], by the same maker of this Front Loader and 'Low Boy' Truck.    [CORRECTION: In an earlier version, I stated that the bucket was plastic.  The sentence has been deleted.  It is not plastic, but coated die-cast metal.]
B001JRB16U|5.0|I ordered Disney's Mary Poppins from Amazon.com.  I received it when I expected it and it was worth the wait.  An added bonus is that it is an authenic copy and not bootlegged as received from a different vendor when I ordered Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The movie itself is very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000001FS6|4.0|U2 followed their best album with a grand oddity recorded at the peak of their obsession with America: \\"Rattle and Hum,\\" a sprawling, fiercely energized double album composed of new studio tracks and live recordings from their \\"Joshua Tree\\" tour.  The band has rarely sounded more aware (or comfortable) with their status as the \\"biggest band in the world,\\" but never have they seemed so deserving.  Covers of sacred rock numbers like \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" sound shockingly true.  Aside from the Dylan cover, most of Side Two could be thrown away; the live rendition of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,\\" complete with church gospel, takes it beyond too far.  But these Irish God-lovers appear worthy of the guest spots from B.B. King and even Bob Dylan, and that means they've come a long way.  Among my favourites: their knockout ode to Billie Holiday, \\"Angel of Harlem\\"; the gorgeous \\"Heartland,\\" which I believe is a left-over from the \\"Joshua Tree\\" sessions; \\"God Part II,\\" a rambunctious nod to Lennon; and the closing piece, \\"All I Want is You,\\" one of their more affecting (and least-assuming) songs.  As for Bono telling the guitarist to \\"play the blues, Edge,\\" on \\"Silver and Gold,\\" which the Edge proceeds to do via his trademark echo-slathered solo, yeah, it's blasphemous--but damn, is it fun.
1603580557|5.0|As a long-time admirer of Donella Meadows' work, and knowing that she died much too young in 2001, I was surprised and enormously gladdened to learn that another book had arrived. Meadows all but completed the volume which has been edited and released by the Sustainability Institute.<br /><br />It is her masterwork. (You did us right, Dana! As Cat Stevens framed it, \\"Oh very young, what did you leave us this time? You're only dancing on this earth for a short while ...\\")<br /><br />The book has been accurately likened to [[ASIN:0618249060 Silent Spring]] for it's breadth and clear explanation of profound truths about the world. Meadows explains systems in easy to understand steps that shed the math and jargon of \\"insider\\" texts but without dumbing down the material. The reader exits the book with a much deeper understanding of how systems operate, from the simplest to the most complex. She teaches you how to look at malfunctioning systems, whether in your home, your business, your town or your planet, and find the pressure points where its possible to make a difference. She explains how and why we smart human beings so often recognize exactly the place where we should push a lever, and almost always push it the wrong way. The book is deep without being impenetrable, and full of wonderful \\"AHA!\\" moments. This one's a keeper and a sharer.
0807126063|5.0|The book A Confederacy of Dunces is wonderful, yet terrible.  Its main character, Ignatius J Reilly, is a learned yet pompous jerk.  Though there are many other characters that are as annoying as Mr. Reilly, he is by far the most heard of in the book.  I happen to have had the not so wonderful pleasure of meeting someone quite similar to Mr. Reilly, and trust me it's not as \\"interesting\\" as one would think.  Ignatius waltzes around everywhere he goes thinking that he is wonderful and that despite the great odds, he is right and everyone else is wrong.  His sole ability is to instill a passionate anger and deep resentment in people.       For me, throughout the book, Ignatius is not so much the character you love to hate, just the character you hate.  He is rude, a slob, and stuck-up.  Mr. Reilly speaks down to all, except of course the only person he obeys, his one-and-only pyloric valve, which is constantly closing and opening giving him great trouble.  He floats around from one job to a second job and then stops.  He worked at Levy Pants and was promptly fired for starting a riot of all things.  He then became a hotdog vendor.  This was an awful job for him because he had to walk around all day selling horrible hotdogs.  And as some of you may know, Ignatius is a). Not the most normal looking person, even in New Orleans, and b). Ignatius hates walking.  Plus when he is working as a hotdog salesman he is rude to people and even refuses some people hotdogs.  On top of all of this, he brings the owner of the company very little money, mainly because he eats most of the hotdogs while attempting to sell them. Ignatius was never willing or ready to work, and I seriously doubt that if the story continued he would.       The story continues in its annoying way for a while.  It introduces new characters, and makes plot changes, for instance, when Myrna Minkoff comes into the scene, writing constantly to Ignatius about how well her campaign is going.  We're not exactly surewhat their relationship is, though.  And how could we forget Mr. and Mrs. Levy?  Mrs. Levy did so terribly on her psychiatry test that people couldn't even give her an \\"F.\\"  And then there's Mr. Levy, who hates his father's company so much he won't give it so much as a glance.  The plot keeps things moving along for a while in everyone's case.  But something that amazes me is that Toole is able to unravel such a twisted plot, and have the book still dish-out such huge amounts of justice.              Everyone else gets what they deserve in the end, everyone that is except for Ignatius.  Ignatius is spared.  From my point of view this is the worst possible ending -- for Ignatius anyway.  Some people might argue with me, but I know for sure that most readers will most definitely share my view. The ending, the part that's supposed to unravel it all and bring the wrath of the hammer of justice down upon all who are deserving of it, fails.  The guiltiest man is spared.  Ignatius gets away unscathed and intact.   This angered me so much that I forced myself to try and see something that I was missing.       The answer to why Ignatius doesn't get his just desserts finally came to me in an extremely clichéd epiphany.  I had been asking the question, \\"When, if ever, would Ignatius get what he had coming?\\"  And I realized that there was only one answer.  The gears that turned Ignatius' wheels of justice had no teeth.  Nothing too terrible ever happened to Ignatius because the gears that brought down justice would just slip and slide across one-another.  I also realized that this rule can be applied to so many of all the fools of the world.  Fools are able to blindly bumble through life, and come out virtually untouched.  In a weird way the idiots of the world are eerily protected by some anti-karmic force.  This is why Ignatius gets away with all of his shenanigans.       John Kennedy Toole is a wonderful writer.  And he can make the most annoying interactions seem quite funny. The book is well written and has such a wonderful topic, yet for anyone who has ever met an Ignatius before, the book will definitely be a different read -- not necessarily worse or better, but different.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|The notion that that US can't provide universal healthcare is bunk.  We waste our money on things we don't need such as insurance and HMO's making very few people very rich while people in the richest country in the world go without.  I personally fear retirement.  Now that everyone's 401ks have blown up, where is everyone's retirement going to come from?<br /><br />This movie provided a fresh look at healthcare.  Education should be next.

B000TGJ80S|5.0|Okay, so I'm not going to claim to be a huge fan of the monster genre, or even Dracula himself, but I will say that upon watching Frances Ford Coppola's rendering of this classic tale I am more apt to sink my fangs a little deeper into this genre.  Yes, while I am not as cultured as some of you are in this particular genre, I do know a good movie when I see one, and `Bram Stoker's Dracula' is a great movie.<br /><br />Thankfully, this version is in stark contrast to the 1979 mind numbing atrocity starring Frank Langella.  Frances Ford Coppola manages to make his Dracula thrilling, engaging, blood chilling and sensual without ever losing us or giving off an air of uncomfortable transition.  There is not a single misstep here; not a frame out of place or an emotion left untapped.  `Bram Stoker's Dracula' hits everything right, proving itself a modern masterpiece; a visually and emotionally stimulating experience.<br /><br />In other words; this is the complete package.<br /><br />I won't get into a long disarray about what this film is about.  You either are familiar with the story or you are not, and if you are not then it's probably best you just brace yourself for the film.  I will say that the film opens by giving a little history into Dracula's origin before telling us this wickedly tantalizing tale.  Count Dracula appears nothing more than an eccentric old man when Jonathan Harker ventures to his castle to tie up some real estate loose ends, but there is an obvious mystery present; and when Dracula catches sight of Harker's fianc&eacute;e Mina Murray he becomes determined to win her heart.  Holding Harker captive, Dracula makes his way into Mina's life and begins to woo her soul.<br /><br />The film is a technical marvel in itself really.  Each set piece is a lavish example of how to do these films correctly.  Everything screams for our attention.  Subtlety is always a blessing, but not in films of this nature.  More is more when it comes to these grand spectacles, and Coppola understood that very well.  The rich reds and velvets add layers of emotional warmth to the film; breeding an air of thick tension and violent sensuality.  The action sequences are brilliantly choreographed and the chemistry between the cast is impeccable.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is Dracula, no ifs ands or buts about it.  He is stunning in all facets of the characters; from old, crippled and haunted to young, vibrant and intoxicating.  He nails this character and breaths a new life into this tale.  Winona Ryder was such a stunning talent back in the early 90's.  I am deeply saddened by her fall from grace.  She desperately needs a comeback, Mickey Rourke style.  Here she is luminous as always.  Anthony Hopkins and Keanu Reeves are both effective in their supporting roles (my best friend stated that this was Reeves best film, but it's also his best performance).  Sadie Frost is flawless as Lucy, Dracula's initial victim.  She is ravenous in each scene, exuding a natural sensuality that feeds off her eventual brutality.<br /><br />With a script rich with character development and ripe with the best of every genre (from horror to drama to romance) as well as a stellar cast and one of the greatest directors of all time (seriously, Coppola is a GOD in this industry), `Bram Stoker's Dracula' is an instant classic; a pure masterpiece that is sure to entice our every desire.well.

0743437497|5.0|I just recently started reading Stephen King. After reading The Stand a few months ago, I took the advice of other King fans who rate The Shining very highly.  I can see why.<br /><br />I'm probably one of the few that never saw the movie outside clips of it here and there and when I've passed it on the TV. So I went into it with mostly a clean slate.  I thought the book was brilliant on many levels. First of all, Stephen King is a master of the written word. This is why I have now become a big fan. I, like many others, don't seek out \\"horror\\" books, its really not my cup of tea. However, King is much more than a horror writer as this book illustrates and that anyone that reads him already knows. King has an understanding of the human mind, pysche, thoughts and emotions unlike anybody I've read.  He gets right into the minds and hearts of the characters in this book, especially Jack and the son Danny. The way he portrays Jack's struggle against alcoholism and his past is amazing. His battle to get on with his life and to be a better man is compelling and draws the reader in. It is a case study on the human experience dealing with alcoholism and all that comes with it.<br /><br />The human element of the story and the way he invites you into the minds and hearts of the characters is gripping enough, but then you add in the story itself as it slowly simmers to a boil, building suspense one page after the next, takes The Shining to the next level. I was riveted and hooked to the point where I had to read the book every moment I could(which isn't often for me).  I just had to keep reading.<br /><br />If you like suspense, you will love this book. If you like to get a bit scared, you will love this book. If you like to get wrapped up in depth of characters and human emotions, then you will love this book. If you read to enjoy the written word expressed by someone that has mastered the language and enjoy a heck of a story why you're at it, then you will love this book. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />If you were like me and stayed away from Stephen King because you don't particularly care for the horror genre, you are truly missing out. He is much, much bigger than that.  I am looking forward to reading more of his work.If you were like me and stayed away from Stephen King because you don't particularly care for the horror genre, you are truly missing out.

With the heavy-hitting bass, and the cheering crowd in the background you definitely feel like you're right there jammin out with them. Can't help but to turn it way up, and blast out your neighbors.. If you even remotely appreciate what Daft Punk has done for electronica/house, you need to buy this album. Please don't rip it, these guys deserve your 15 bucks. And much more if you get a chance to experience them live.
0060254920|5.0|Inspired by my Ammy buddy Betty Dravis (yes, that's DRAVIS, not Davis), I decided to go ahead and write a review for a book I wouldn't normally.  I become so self consumed with reading, watching and listening to more adult fare that I tend to neglect this genre altogether.  Recently though, as my daughter has gotten a little older, I have been reading a lot of children's books.  Her favorite thing in the world is being read to and so from the minute I get home until it's time to eat I find myself reading to my little angel.<br /><br />As a young boy I remember loving this book, and so since my daughter has this newfound adoration for books I decided to buy her a copy.<br /><br />She LOVES it.<br /><br />The great thing about `Where the Wild Things Are' is that it is written at the right level to engage them without over stimulating them.  There are few words, and they are strung along across quite a few pages with some big illustrations.  You don't have to linger on one particular page for too long, which is good because after a while of staring at the same picture my daughter starts to turn the pages for me.  The illustrations are wonderfully done; the monsters (wild things) are goofy enough so as not to frighten the child (I read this to my daughter before bed every night, so I guess there's further proof).  The illustrations, especially on the pages without words, are great ways to get your children involved in reading as well.  There are a few pages in the center of the book that show Max and the Wild Things dancing and howling and swinging from the trees.  It's at this point where I get my daughter to dance in the living room or howl at the ceiling.  She loves it, and watching her get so excited over a book is such a genuine joy.  Another thing I really like about the wording is that it has a very nice, poetic flow to it.  It almost encourages a smooth tone in your voice.  It's written in such an easy way that it sounds almost comforting.<br /><br />And of course it teaches children that no matter what, they are always loved.<br /><br />I completely recommend this book.  It was a highlight of my childhood, and now it's a highlight for my little angel.  I'm positive that you too will enjoy this book as a family.  Another selling point is that they are currently filming the movie adaptation to this book, so getting your children interested in this now will only heighten their joy for the film when it is released.  I'm hoping by then my daughter will be just as stoked as I am.matter what, they are always loved.    I completely recommend this book.

B001R0KH3W|2.0|I have waited for over 25 years for a definitive DVD by the great Stevie Wonder. I saw him in concert  7 years ago and he was awesome. This product showcases the audience more than it does the artist.  One or two audience participation/sing-a-log songs is OK, but a dozen? Come on Stevie, the crowd  came to hear you. He didn't do this 7 years ago. I  believe that the death of his mother two years  ago has greatly changed his slant towards music and performing. The audience sings on half of his songs,  while he simply plays along. That is not the Stevie Wonder that I know. This could have been  one of the truly great DVDs/Blu-Ray discs of all-time, but it is flawed due to the above.
B00005N5S2|5.0|\\"MacArthur\\" has strong ponts and weak points.<br /><br />Strong points:<br />1. Typically, Gregory Peck gives a great performance.<br />2. The screenplay for \\"MacArthur\\" follows a coherent timeline.  The story doesn't jump around without explanation.<br />3. The relationship between MacArthur and Truman was accurately depicted.<br />4. The cinematography was excellent.<br />5. While the point of view is obviously sympathetic to MacArthur as a soldier, it does not portray the individual as a saint without fault.<br /><br />Weak points:<br />1. Although the battle scenes were fairly well staged, at one point, some stock footage of a dive bomber dropping its load on target was inserted.  The only problem is that the silhouetted airplane is an F4 Phantom, which wasn't put into service until the 1960's.<br />2. Truman's reasons for relieving MacArthur were not fully explained.<br />3. There was little mention of MacArthur's service prior to Corrigedor.<br />4. Although MacArthur was portrayed as having the final sayso in strategic operations concerning the Pacific Theater, it wasn't necessarily so.<br />5. Even though the film's intro alludes to the image of MacArthur as a controversial figure, the screenplay does not adequately follow up on this idea.  Even though some light is thrown on his political ambition, MacArthur is portrayed for the most part as someone who, in some other dimension, could have been the CEO of some financial outfit.  The MacArthur Peck portrays does not appear to be the rather ruthless individual that at times, MacArthur was.<br /><br />I bought this film because one of the Marines in my unit was an extra in the Korean War sequence, which was filmed at least in part, at Camp Pendleton.

It's a fine piece of art.
B0017YDPI2|4.0|I saw my first episode of Supernatural by accident.  It happened to be on one of my favorite channels.  I loved it and immediately started recording further episodes on my Tivo.  The writers have a lot of imagination; there really isn't any \\"typical\\" episode.  I got my wife to enjoy it--which is saying something because she never watches shows like this.    I purchased the DVDs of all available seasons.  By the time I had started viewing Supernatural, many of the episodes had already passed me by.  Also, the shows are good enough that rewatching is still enjoyable.  All the DVDs had a normal layout, with pretty standard menus, etc.  Unfortunately, the blu-ray version of season 3 is bizarre.  As another reviewer indicated, there is something like a menu, but it is only available by trickery.  Also, this menu only gives access to discussions about how episodes are made.      The best way to access different episodes on the blu-ray disks is to use the fast-forward on the remote.  That is why I only gave a 4-star rating.  Having said that, the increased resolution of the sound and video does enhance the viewing a lot.    Something no one has mentioned is that this is about the only series on TV with religious values as a subplot.  The show assumes the existence of a heaven and a hell, with angels and demons to go with them.  One episode in particular has Dean, a main character who has been battling demons all his life, debating the existence of a God and a heaven.  He is perfectly willing to go along with having demons all around, but is initially unwilling to accept the obvious implication of having the opposite--God and heaven.  His conversion mirrors the spiritual journey of many in today's society who are educated in agnosticism but eventually find religion.  The heaven he finds, however, is definitely a Christian heaven.  The show has a lot of meaning for contemporary society.
B001718N96|3.0|Hercule Poirot is one of the most recognizable detectives around, and The Mysterious Affair at Styles is an excellent introduction to him.  (Styles Court is revisited in Curtain, the last Poirot novel)  Great beach reading, with a relative handful of characters, a number of them portrayed quite memorably.    However, it mystifies me that they would omit the handful of illustrations for this Kindle edition.  This is a public domain novel in the United States, thanks to its original publish date.  It can be legally had for free, and there are other editions out there that do include these illustrations.  Still, this edition gets you convenient delivery of an excellent book, and the illustrations omitted (so far I've noticed the lack of the floor plan and a scrap of handwriting, both referred to in the text) are not really that necessary to enjoying the plot - I just feel that it is wrong of them not to be up-front about the absence of these small things, though I note that they do not claim that this edition is unabridged.

While Rueben recovers from a heart attack, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and company (Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, ad nauseum) implement a far-fetched and ill-defined plan to sink the big opening.      I really enjoyed the first movie and found something to appreciate in the second, as well, but this third installment is just awful from beginning to end.  They use the drill that dug the Chunnel to burrow under the casino so they can simulate an earthquake?  Really?  Are you kidding me?  And nobody notices?  By the way, when the first one breaks down, they manage to come up with a second one.  This is only one element of a plan that would require unlimited resources and the omnipotence of the Almighty himself to pull off.  I think it was just made as an excuse for Clooney and his cool posse to pal around in Vegas for a few months.  What a life!
0312539517|3.0|Paths Of Glory is Archer's attempt to fictionalize the story of George Mallory and his dream of being the first person to climb to the top of Mt. Everest. It covers a thirty-two year period ranging from Mallory's childhood to his third attempt to climb Everest in 1924, at age thirty-seven. In real life, it remains a mystery as to whether Mallory ever achieved his goal, as he was last seen four hundred feet from the top. Archer does a decent job in  \\"covering all the bases\\" of Mallory's life. However, in trying to pack all of the major historical events in his life in just an average length book, Archer, in my opinion, doesn't provide sufficient depth in most of these areas to create a full sense of who Mallory was and what motivated him. Further, Archer provides, at best, only superficial characterizations of the key people in Mallory's life (e.g., his wife, his children, his climbing partners, etc.). Overall, Paths Of Glory is an entertaining read -- particularly if you have an interest in mountain-climbing -- but it is not one that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat to find out what happens next. Given Jeffrey Archer's successful career as a novelist it will not be surprising to find Paths Of Glory on major bestseller lists, although be forewarned that it doesn't deserve to reach the summit of these lists.
0767827902|5.0|Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show is a movie about the changing face of America as seen through the eyes of a small town. The film relates the happenings in Anarene,Texas from October 1951 to October 1952. America is changing. The cinema on the corner than had been the hub of life for the small town is giving way to the television age. Into this world comes the senior class of Anarene High School.<br /><br />School friends Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) yearn for more than the town has to offer. They also yearn for the prettiest girl in town Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepard). As their lives change we learn of the goings on of the citizens around them: there is Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson)owner of the cinema, the cafe and the pool hall; Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) the wife of the high school coach who wants more in her life; Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn) caught in a world in which she is alone with herself.<br /><br />The film is episodic but makes its points with ease. The ensemble cast was justly praised and the film was awarded with eight Academy Award nominations. Director Bogdanovich never had a better film than this and the black and white photography by Robert Surtees is almost perfect.<br /><br />The disc is the definitive director's cut which adds about eight minutes of previously deleted footage. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1 as was the presentation print. The mono sound while not perfect does an adequate job with the dialogue filled script. The extras are the hour long documentary The Last Picture Show: A Look Back which features interviews with Bogdanovich and the cast; a short theatrical Re-release featurette and some talent files.<br /><br />This film deserves to be on the shelf of any serious movie lover.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Disney has done a masterful job with this animation masterpiece.  The video and audio presentation are flawless and the film itself is a timeless, beautifully crafted piece of art.  A must have for any video library.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is great to get your brain working...definitely takes logic to do well, but it is so easy to play.<br /><br />I rated the durability only 4 stars because I have seen a very used game have some broken pieces, but like I said it was a very used game.<br /><br />Definitely a great game! I play it often & I've gotten several of my friends into it too.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie was better than I first thought and my hats off to Clint Eastwood and Ron Howard.The movie exposed corruption in the police department in Los Angeles.The corruption is not only still there but in a lot of police departments.The cops who knew about the kidnappings and murders should have received the death penalty themselves.The way Angelie Jolie's character and the women in the mental institution was treated in this movie made me mad.No wonder many people in our country have a hatred towards law enforcement.
0142000663|5.0|Just finished this great book and have promised to pass it on to my fiance and daughter.  You will laugh, you will cry, and you will learn all about how easy it's not to own a vineyard.  Eye opening and inspiring, a feel good book in the tradition of Marly.  You will not be disappointed.
B000000W6X|5.0|Can´t say, which MA album is best. It depends on mood, when thinking what to listen. If someone asks me for best MA songs, it will be nothing from this album. But I listen to this album most, its relaxation for me, relaxation in luxury way. This CD sounds very special, so clear, softly, beatifully, with nobleness. Great album...
B001TP698C|2.0|I grew up with this band and they taught me alot about music.  The most important thing they taught me is not to release the same song three times (one studio & one live is just fine).  The problem here is they never taught themselves the same thing.  Yes, we get it.  Didn't have to do some of these again for the fourth, fifth & sixth times.
0618918248|4.0|I admit to being somewhat a fan of Dr. Dawkins.  I enjoyed much of this book, but point out that he lists many examples of despicable events in the name of religion, but as an atheist, leaves out the many examples of humanity done by religion.  Not surprising. I knew what I was in for when I bought the book. Even though I do still have some belief, there are points he made that I have previously been struggling with.  I don't think this book greatly swayed me one way or the other, but was interesting nonetheless. I particularly find the statistical research on incendiary prayer interesting. Though it's possible to find a research study that will reinforce whatever view one would like to take.  It's is intriguing enough to pursue follow up reading on the matter.  What I don't agree with are religious people trying to ban Dr. Dawkins from public speaking at Universities based on dogmatic rejection of scientific study; namely evolution.
B0001I562I|5.0|Flight of the Navigator is a fun movie for the whole family.  It has enough plot to keep the interest of the adults and enough fun stuff to keep the kids entertained.  The special effects were quite good, I thought, considering how old the movie is.  It is clean, fun, exciting and just a good evening viewing.
B000002VSN|5.0|Dear Scott Wilson, Mr. Editorial Reviewer:  To begin with, let me start with a direct quote from your review.  \\"Her voice is as crystalline as ever, but overall it seems a somewhat soulless effort, even though the themes are much more secular than she's braved before.\\"  Scott, this is one of the finest examples of contemporary Gospel music one can find in terms of production, musicianship, arrangement (all of which are air tight), and overall performance by none other than Whitney Houston.  That takes care of the \\"somewhat soulless effort\\" part of your review.  More importantly, perhaps you should look up the meaning of the word \\"secular\\" before you publish it in a way that demonstrates that you understand it to mean its opposite.  There are a few secular songs included in this recording, but we know what you meant.  I just had to point that out.        At the foundation of it all, this recording has blessed me very much.  I highly recommend it for any lover of great music created with love and passion.  It will move you.
0765350386|4.0|Having picked up 'Mistborn' on a whim, I was pleasantly surprised with what I found.     What I liked:    -The undeniably original magic system. It shows a depth of creativity that is truly admirable in the admittedly well-plumbed depths of the epic fantasy genre.   - The amount of twists contained in the book, especially at the end. The author really kept me guessing.   -The fact that Sanderson didn't stretch himself. Most of the book takes place in one city, showing that the author exercised restraint in wanting to explore his vast world. Instead of developing many locations with little detail, he developed one location with a vast amount of detail.     What I disliked:    -Vin perpetuates the classic fantasy-story protagonist cliche: becoming too good at things too fast. She basically masters Allomancy within the period of a year and becomes a believable noble after a few weeks of training.   -There was a lot of places where the story becomes mired by too much dialogue that does too little to progress the story. These parts really dragged for me.     In conclusion:     The book, though not without its flaws, shows a lot of promise not only for this series but for the work that the author will give us in the future. Given time to hone his skills, Sanderson could easily become one of the giants of epic fantasy.     Looking forward to book two!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|I've read most of Sophie Kinsella's books and I thought by far this one was the best. It's easy to like the main character Lexi, and her story is funny and riveting all at the same time. I absolutely loved this book.
1600240526|5.0|We listened to Stone Cold on our way from North Carolina to Washington, DC and back.  This thriller kept us intriged the entire trip and made the trip seem very short.  We purchased this audio book after listening to The Collector.  We just had to find out what happened to Annabelle Conroy and the Camel Club.  Don't miss this one or The Collector.
B000GH3CVQ|2.0|Well, I absolutely love the Once soundtrack. It's passionate, well-balanced and fun. The Swell Season album misses on all of these marks.  They actually re-worked a few tracks from Once, and unfortunately, didn't improve them at all. I'd rather listen to the originals.  And the new songs are almost all Glen singing, and just aren't very interesting.  I bought this, listened to it twice, then simply gave it to my friend, who actually felt the same way about it.  Stick to Once.
B00151G0CK|5.0|Purchased product as a birthday gift for my 20 year old granddaughter, who enjoyed it tremendously.    Product was received in time advertised.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|I love this movie and give it ten stars instead of four! I cried, laughed, was mad, basically it took me through the motions. There were so really emotional scenes that got to me the most. Like when Nullah lost his mom, when he was kidnapped and sent to the island, when the Drover thought Sarah was dead, when Magari was killed, when Nullah saw his Mrs. Boss and said he could say her name. I saw a side of the war I never knew existed. It makes me look at Australia differently but in a good way. It opened my eyes to the Lost generations as they are called.I have already seen this movie ten times and I am still not tired of watching it. Despite knowing how it ends it feels like the first time Im watchin it.
031606792X|2.0|I'm so disappointed to be writing a negative review about this book. I absolutely loved the first 3 books.    Then came Breaking Dawn.    I was ready to love it like I loved the previous 3 books - to not be able to put it down and stay up late reading it.  It ended up being a struggle for me to wade through this nonsense to finish it.      First of all, we lost the essence of our favorite characters.  For some reason, Edward changed into a doormat, catering to Bella's every whim.  He's no longer witty, sarcastic or even endearing.  In this book, he basically serves as Bella's servant, sitting idly by and doing whatever she asks him to.  Meyer doesn't even really focus on him at all.  We also lost Alice.  Formerly Bella's best friend, Alice takes a backseat in this book the same way Edward does.  She doesn't have opinions on anything and doesn't seem to care about Edward or Bella for most of the book, until she reemerges at the end.  Charlie changes from a caring father into a \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" bystander.  And what about Esme?  It was as if she barely there despite the fact her daughter ran away, her daughter-in-law was dying and evil forces were after her granddaughter.  She was always portrayed as extremely maternal, but she faded into the shadows at just the time the family matriach should be in the forefront.    Meyer created wonderful characters in the previous books and had a responsibility to do them justice.      Meyer conveniently bends existing storylines throughout the book to reach the happy ending at the end of the book.  Suddenly some newborn vampires are perfectly composed?  Suddenly the Cullens can easily handle being around human blood (Bella gets a paper cut in the second book and everyone goes nuts.  Now she drinks it out of a cup and everyone is fine).  Suddenly the werewolves are shape shifters, which Edward apparently knew the whole time (even though he referred to them as werewolves in previous books) but decided not tell anyone, saying \\"It never came up\\".  What?!  Bella conveniently not only has no problems at all as a newborn vampire, but also has the most powerful gift imaginable.  Charlie doesn't ever questions Bella's mysterious \\"illness\\" or ask any questions about why she suddenly looks different and has a different voice, along with a 3 month old that has the intelligence of a 3 year old (which could be it's own issue in itself!)  And while there was no sex in any of the previous books, Edward even mentioning he wasn't sure that vampires had any (\\"I suppose\\" he says in the first book when Bella asks him if vampire marriages are like other marriages sexually), suddenly vampires are sex crazed, with Emmett even bragging that he and Rosalie have broken houses in passion.  I'm not even going to get into the graphic and disturbing labor scenes or the fact that Renee is completely left out of this book (Charlie calls her when Bella almost gets hit by a car in the first book, but not when she's being quarantined, completely changes her look and voice, and suddenly has a baby?)    It just doesn't add up.    Like I said, I loved the first 3 books, and I love Stephenie Meyer. I know everyone has a different idea of a happy ending for this saga, and that the author can't make everyone happy, but I didn't think she would leave me feeling so disappointed.  I feel like she did a disservice to the wonderful characters she created.
B001AQMBKA|5.0|lost may just be the best SERIES ever, looked at as a whole not per season, its like a mind blowing smart movie experience. so glad that the show is slowly developing into something noone would expect.<br />watch this season very closely cause it offers many important hints that are about to happen in the current season(5)<br />btw season 3 and 4 look AMAXING ON HD so i think its the way to go!
630587493X|5.0|Haven't had opportunity to actually view this DVD yet (still working on the others I bought at the same time!), but this one came still wrapped, and the disc was virgin-new when I opened the box.  Was delivered quickly, and I am loking forward to enjoying this most excellent movie soon!
0380799006|5.0|This book is capable of imparting a lot of wisdom. It is designed to lead you through a course in which you come to understand what's beneath sibling rivalry and learn techniques and attitudes that can help defuse it or prevent it from starting in the first place. It's solid information clearly presented and well worth reading by any parent who is concerned with the issue. I disagree with the critical reviewer who claimed the info was outdated--I find it very relevant and helpful.
B001LRJH0K|3.0|Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen work well together. Now where have I seen their camaraderie before??? Hmmmm.... No, it wasn't [[ASIN:B001JNNE1O A History of Violence]]...they were enemies in THAT movie.<br /><br />Ah, yes, it was [[ASIN:B0018RWMNM Lonesome Dove]]! You see, in Appaloosa Ed Harris is doing his best Gus McCrae (Robert Duvall) and Viggo Mortensen is doing his best Woodrow Call (Tommy Lee Jones). While the chemistry is certainly there, the imitation is almost blatant. Not a bad thing I guess, but it took away a lot of the originality that Appaloosa had the potential for. Harris and Mortensen could have created a unique, memorable pair seen in \\"buddy movies\\" like the aforementioned Lonesome Dove or Lethal Weapon (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover); but instead the Harris Directed Appaloosa chose to imitate rather than create, and will result in my mind as a forgettable duo.<br /><br />The story isn't anything new either. Basically (very basically) there are some bad guys in town and the townspeople can't deal with them themselves. So they bring in hired guns Harris and Mortensen to uphold the law. The bad guys take offense, and Harris and Mortensen go to work.<br /><br />There's some fun action in Appaloosa, but the film is more of a buddy movie with buddy interactions than it is a rompin' stompin' Western. The cast is full of familiar faces, and they all do a good job being \\"Westerners\\". (On the unfamiliar side there's a glimpse of Ren&eacute;e Zellweger sans clothing...let's just say that she looks better with cloths ON, so a glimpse was more than enough.)<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained. Appaloosa's a good one for your rental queue when there's slim pickins.
0307341550|4.0|From the second you open Gillian Flynn's \\"Sharp Objects\\", you know you're not reading a dime mystery novel. From the get-go, Flynn's sharp writing drives the story with the force of a turbine engine. Her prose is easy to follow, compact, and beautiful - written with the type of thin, \\"Say-What-You-Mean\\" edge that would make Stephen King drool.     For her debut novel, Flynn has crafted a beautifully twisted story dealing with the intricacies of small town wickedness (hello again, Mr. King), dysfunctional families, and the dark places of the human mind. The story's leading lady is a compelling, and disturbed journalist named Camille Preaker. Flynn leads Camille through a serious of disturbing murders which continually reflect her own childhood, forcing her to confront demons of her past.     For a first release, Sharp Objects is captivating. A feat many other authors would be jealous of. The book will haunt you, begging to be picked up again. While it won't scare the living daylights out of you, you'll probably find yourself squeeming in your chair.     However, Sharp Objects does have it's flaws - for all it's twists and unpredictable moments, there are equally predictable and forseen moments. The conclusion feels rushed, and almost forced (though satisfying at the same time).     Sharp Objects will appeal to any thriller/suspense/mystery/horror fan. It's non-literary, so-real-it's-twisted reading. Definitely worth checking out. Puts Gillian Flynn on the map for future reading.
0823016714|5.0|[[ASIN:0955763703 Virtually Maria (Virtual Trilogy)]]<br /><br />I came across this book when I was looking for reference material to illustrate my Captain Cockle childrens' books and have kept it near my drawing board ever since.<br /><br />What I like about it is that it gives a very wide range of material in terms of expressions, angles and different ages that I have not come across in any other book of its type. It also uniquely shows some examples of how some of the photos have been turned into caricatures or cartoons (both of humans and animals) that give an interesting insight into how they might be used.<br /><br />My only criticism (which I see I share with a few other reviewers) is that it is difficult to lay this book down on a drawing table without it flipping shut again due to its paperback format. Spiral binding would have been better, but that's a small price to pay for such a valuable resource. I look forward to a companion manual perhaps on figures, hands or activities.
B0009W5JS2|4.0|I think the second XXX is an okay sequel.  I was surprised they didn't have same actor portray agent XXX.  Ice Cube is unlikely in an action hero role, just doesn't seem the right body type, but I thought he did a good job.  I liked the prison break, one of my favorite parts of this movie.  I thought the movie was a tad too long, like most movies these days, but there was plenty of action to carry it through.  My overall opinion, Not bad.
B001IZFXMQ|5.0|This is a great audio book and even better story.  I normally don't go for abridged items but the trade off for the individual voice actors is well worth the parts left out.  You won't be able to stop listening!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews on amazon, nor do I even hardly even watch TV shows. But Breaking Bad has seem to change my perspective. I absolutly love this TV show. The drama, the suspense, and the action! Are all great in this show. So yeah, im no writer so my review is probably horrible, but the show is fantastic. When they had the writers strike last year I was soooo upset. Im glad its back on the air and season 2 has been rockin!!!!
B0009MAP9A|5.0|I was deeply impressed with this album from the first listen.  From the opening track 'The Times They Are A-Changin' to 'Restless Farewell', the listener is immersed in an album truly reflective of the chaotic 60's in which it was produced.  So much of these songs still ring true today.  Consider this a mint from Dylan's protest days and an essential purchase for all those into acoustic folk.  Brilliant.
B00154GEFU|1.0|I had high hopes for this CD with the return of Asia's original line up.  Opening with 'Never Again', a classic Asia rocker, I thought my hopes had been fulfilled.  Sadly, the remainder of the album is full of sappy, arena ballads.  If this is your cup of tea, great.  Otherwise, download the MP3 of 'Never Again' and bypass the rest of the CD.
B000002NFM|5.0|This album is freakin great! I'm not a huge fan of Techno music because most of it is club/rave music. But this CD is somethin else... I've listened to it TONS of times. If you haven't then check it out!
1577314808|5.0|This is a must read for everyone.  It talks about the power of now. How to live in the moment, to stop and look at the beautiful sunset. We only have right now and when you grasp that, it makes life much more enjoyable.  Eckhart Tolle is excellent and it is a book you have to read and take in slowly. It is very deep, but rings so true. If you like this book you will also like his other book, The New Earth. Get the book you will be glad you did. It has improved my life a hundred fold.
1593082800|4.0|I loved this book, well I loved the first five hundred and fifty pages anyway.  The ending was a little bit of a disappointment to me.<br /><br />I had been engrossed in this story for days and was looking forward to savoring the ending but I found myself being a bit disappointed by it.  It felt tedious and over worked and a tad on the contrived side.<br /><br />I think it would have been a better book without Count Fosco's account of events. I thought his account was a repetition of events and instead of finishing with a big bang it felt a little like a slow fizzle.<br /><br />I was satisfied by the events that unfolded, though they were as I have said to a certain degree contrived and the ending was tied up rather neatly.  It was the detailed and repetitive recounting of events that disappointed me.<br /><br />I liked and hated the characters Collins created, but they were all either 'good guys' or 'bad guys', either friends and family of the victim or the people perpetrating the plot against her.<br /><br />A book that I found to be similar yet more satisfying was 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters.  You might like to try that if you enjoyed this.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|Sorry haven't written my review, as I have been recovering from surgery.  We received it in a very fast manor.  It has become a very welcome addition to our collection.  The item came as was promised in the initial discription.  Thank you.  Look forward to doing business again.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|Does anyone else find it curious that the sudden wave of 5 star reviews for this ridiculous album are all by reviewers with absolutely no other reviews to their credit?  Not to mention they sound like they're trying to sell me a box of cereal.  Tastes great!  Try it you'll like it!!!     Bottom line...this album is a disaster.  Ashlee Simpson rocks harder than this.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Sorry I haven't written my review sooner, I have been recovering from surgery.  This item was shipped in a very timely manor.  I recieved it as was posted before purchase.  Thank you for adding such a great movie to my collection.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This is definitely the best film of 2008 along with the dark knight. Very smart and quite original, i recommend this film for everybody.
0312539517|5.0|In the spirit of George Mallory - I read this book \\"because it was there\\"...<br /><br />I have never understood man's need to climb mountains - so the pure enjoyment reading this book gave me was totally unexpected.<br /><br />The story of George Mallory and his quest to conquer Mount Everest has been one of the unsolved mysteries of recent history. From the confirmation that he was 600 feet from the top when he disappeared while making his third attempt in 1924. To the discovery of his body in 1999.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer makes you genuinely \\"like\\" George and under his talented pen his life, friends and family are brilliantly fleshed out.  You will cheer him on when he climbs the Eiffel Tower...hold your breath when he declares his love to Ruth and feel breathless as he takes on the climb of a lifetime.<br /><br />I will look for more by Archer - I have to echo what a previous reviewer said...a book that open new worlds (especially ones you didn't think were for you) and inspires new interests - those are what reading is about!!!  Thank You Jeffrey Archer!
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I ordered the DVD online from Amazon.com it arrived in four days. The dvd was every bit what I expected, great. I've had no problem from Amazon.com. I would order from them again.
1416562605|4.0|This is a fast paced excellent read, totally engrossing.  It is thought provoking, providing an in depth look at another culture.  The main character is at once endearing and repellent, and totally understandable.
B000K1P66W|4.0|[[ASIN:140191750X Change Your Thoughts - Change Your Life: Living the Wisdom of the Tao]]  This book written about four agreements basically talks about honoring yourself.  It brings up that assumptions really have no purpose and often have people deal with incorrect information.  And the author gives a simple solution of asking questions.  It is written in a way to cause thought in a person about having joys and getting things out of the way that stop this.  Good read.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|This movie is amazing, and it still shocks me even today.<br />Its a must own if you like ghost stories.  Love it
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This was a gift for my 8 year old daughter for getting 100 on a spelling test. She saw this movie a few weeks ago and has asked for it ever since. She has watched it numerous times since she has gotten it.  It's a very enjoyable movie to watch for adults as well. It's well worth it to own in your DVD library.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Much like Batman, its a instant classic, the movie is very entertaining and done well.  Great acting, even though no one does a better joker then Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger's joker wasn't bad at all.<br />RIP Heath Ledger
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I will not write a review about this story.  It's all been said.  I'm simply here to add my 5 star rating to this \\"masterpiece.\\"  I've watched it no less than 20 times in this last month.  Trust me (and all the other reviewers) it is fantastic!!
0060935464|3.0|At the beginning of the book, I didn't think it was very good and it was kind of boring. Once you get a couple of chapters into the book, you begin to understand why the book was written. The setting of the book was a little country town during the time when blacks and whites were not treated equally. The story is told by a little girl that is faced with many challenges and is discovering that the world can be really unfair.
0470449748|3.0|This is the review for the The GMAT Review 12th Edition (2009) (A lot of reviews are for older versions of this book).  I have the 11th Edition (Orange Cover), and bought this new edition hoping for brand new practice questions, but most of the questions are the same.  The diagnostic test is even the same.    This is a great book to prepare for the GMAT, but if you already own the 11th Edition (orange cover), then don't bother.  There's really nothing in here that isn't in that version
006112429X|5.0|Shriver keeps you on your toes as you retrace Eva's steps back in time to figure out where she went wrong. From each lurid detail of boyhood, to some realistic concerns of child-rearing in the modern world, this book is a rare masterpiece from an author who can enthrall and amuse, disgust and shock all at the same time.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I picked up the book after getting into HUGE argument with my mother and it was the best remedy! I found myself laughing hysterically as things would unwind with the book. It is an extremely easy read and perfect to pick up for just a little time off from reality!! I'm really hoping that she does another book like this one!
B000000OF6|3.0|Like the title states, it is an \\"almost\\" greatest hits, but still an excellent gift. The reason, that I say \\"almost\\", is that it doesn't have tracks from the first Highlander. Even though, these are on the CD, A Kind of Magic, still, it was the primary songs, that made the movie, a cult classic(i.e., Princes of the Universe, and Gimme the Prize(Kurgan's Theme). However, it does have Who wants to live Forever. I brought it, for my cousin, for his 30-something birthday. And from what I have heard, he's playing it, to death. The service from Amazon is stellar, as usual. Keep up the excellent work.
0449000729|5.0|great...great read....sweeping historic novel covering six generations...makes me wonder why i shunned european history in school...if you missed this book...grab a copy now....you'll be hooked into the story.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|If you liked previous albums by Nickelback - you will like this album.  Not quite as creative as some of their past releases - but over all a good listen.
B000HLDFK4|4.0|What do you get when you cross Jack Finney's classic short story \\"The Love Letter\\" and Richard Matheson's \\"Bid Time Return\\" (AKA \\"Somewhere in Time\\") And you get The Lake House. A interesting story of a man and woman who meet through a time traveling mailbox, sort of.    Well done story yes it gets a bit dripy at times but we enjoyed it with the exception of we had figured out a major plot point fairly early(will not divulge it here)which had us stressing out and annoyed at the possibility. THankfully the movie rewarded us instead of disapointed!    Worth seeing, Bullock and Reeves do indeed have a strong chemistry I did feel for the character of Morgan though...
072325804X|5.0|After seeing the movie about Beatrix Potter I wanted to have a book that contained all of her stories and illustrations and this book fit the bill.  The illustrations are all her original works including preliminary pen drawings rarely seen. It is a substantial book that comes with a hard cover protector.  I love it and recommend any Ms Potter fan to have this in their library.
B000FC130E|4.0|This is my second Neil Gaiman book, with American Gods being the first.  I read this fairly soon after reading that book, which in retrospect is not a great idea, that that being the case with many writers.<br />Most of my complaints are the similarity of the books . . . like two worlds, things seen and unseen, etc.  I think this was a more readable and better book.<br />One criticism of his writing is he too often uses a literary convention of opposites.  Like (and these are not actual quotes) 'he seemed very small but was over 7 feet tall' or 'the train approached at very high rate of speed, but at the same time was barely even moving'.  I started to find it distracting, just waiting for the next one.<br /><br />In this book Richard turns out differently than I had thought he would, and that was good.  There were plot twists and changes that were well done.  I am still not sure what was the true relationship tension between Richard and Door. It felt adult and romantic at times and yet at times she it is not.  I guess the bigger part is she is played at times as a girl and a times a woman.  I found it odd that in the end when Richard is back and Jessica asks if he has been with anyone else, he mentally lists Door last and almost like a stretch.  I guess I misread parts of it.

0141031182|5.0|Trade Not Aid for Africa East, West, South or North<br />BY K'OYOO NICK, TANZANIA DAILY NEWS, 26 OCTOBER 2013<br /><br />DEAD AID a book authored by Zambian Economist Dambisa Moyo, is remarkable in many ways, least of all which is in the way it debunks the aid myth.That an African woman intellectual is the author makes it even more remarkable because it completely shatters the aid myth from a perspective that truly reminds one that the leadership of Africa has been a let-down , and that it is almost always been men in the driving seat feeding on and off the myth that aid is.<br /><br />Last week, readers may recall news report in the regions media that the US had donated forensics equipment worth Ksh12m to the Kenya Police. Ksh12 is equivalent to Tsh216m or (us$141,176) at current exchange rates.<br /><br />Coming so soon after the terrorist attack at the Westgate Mall at Nairobi's Westland's' suburb, this &#34;donation&#34; from the US friends of Kenya got national newspapers coverage and probably had people stop work for hours on end to receive and entertain the guests.<br /><br />Looked at against the revelations that Kenya's Auditor General had come to the conclusion that over Ksh 300b (US$3b) could not be accounted for in the year 2011-2012 financial year, this donation, no matter how well intentioned was a true insult to not only the people of Kenya but Africa at large.<br /><br />If Kenya as the Auditor General says can afford to run with an unaccounted for amount of US$3b in one financial year, the question is, why 50 years after independence and many years after it was established that the country requires a forensics laboratory, it still does not have one?<br /><br />As author Dambisa Moyo opines, Aid has become a multi-billion dollar industry that benefits a small cabal of the recipient and the giver. Aid has become part of the entertainment industry. 'Why is it that Africa, alone among the continents of the world, seems to be locked into a cycle of dysfunction?<br /><br />Why is it that out of all the continents, Africa seems to be unable to get its foot on the economic ladder? Are African people universally incapable? Are its leaders genetically more venal, more ruthless, more corrupt? What is it about Africa that holds it back? The answer has its roots in Aid.&#34;<br /><br />Dambisa's thought -provoking ideas are backed by very simple facts on the ground and the very acts like the forensic equipment donation, which cements the idea that Africans are unable to plan, are corrupt to the core and still need the western operatives. Hand-up to get forensic equipment which we need but won't plan for and buy! It is a sad reminder of how aid has made Africa dependent and not independent.<br /><br />It is important to note that Dambisa references are drawn from experiences have grown up in one of Africa's poorest countries, Zambia, but can easily be replaced by Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Senegal, Congo DRC, Sierra Leone , Liberia or Nigeria.<br /><br />Indeed, not long ago, while addressing residents of Mtwara President Jakaya Kikwete in reply to criticism that he travelled abroad too many times said the aid he gets from those trips would possibly be taken by Kenyans if he did not travel to pursue them!<br /><br />The head of state was speaking from a culture of aid which has made aid a competitive industry for African governments that year in year out trot to the capitals of developed countries with begging bowls for as little as us$141,000 worth of forensic equipment aid. It is not only an embarrassment, but also a travesty to what we all know as the wealth that Africa holds in her bowels.<br /><br />Why is the aid industry thriving when we all know dependency is no solution to the development challenges? To understand this we must go back to where the aid rain began to beat us. It goes back to the post-second world war period and the need to do a Marshall Africa plan.<br /><br />This combined with the West and East divide led us to where we are today. Of course circumstances such as lack of education & awareness too made their contribution.<br /><br />Today, African policy makers need to steer the conversation away from aid to trade. However, to make that happen we must &#34;decolonise the mind&#34; as Kenyan author Ngugi Wa Thiongo would say. Such references to African countries competing for &#34;rare aid&#34; belong to yesterday. We know the world does not owe us a living.<br /><br />Africa today needs leaders who recognise that trade between one another holds the greatest promise of sustainable development and this does not happen under circumstances where Tanzania believes itself to be the darling of United States because two sitting US Presidents have visited the country nor any other African country for that matter. Why receive mosquito nets in Aid when nets can be manufactured in Arusha, Lusaka or Kampala?<br /><br />African countries need to plug the huge revenue holes in their expenditure and leaders are the worst in this extravagance. In East Africa today, the Presidents motorcade could be anything from 17 to 45 top of the range luxury cars in countries where the populace lives on less than 1 US dollar a day. Yet the leaders convince themselves they are working day in and out to eliminate poverty. Their retirement benefits are lifelong insurance covers.<br /><br />Under Kenya's new constitution, the fight over the national cake has moved from Nairobi to the counties and it isn't about service delivery it's all about cars and salaries. If you add this to the amount of money being lost in theft and corruption, one has the answer to Africa's development challenge.<br /><br />All this anguish against ICC should be turned into energy against ourselves and our leaders for turning Africa into beggar nations and using our resources to fuel their hunger for power and personal aggrandisement.<br /><br />Aid fuels internecine wars and results in dependency. &#34;What if World Bank and IMF called each country in Africa and said aid would stop in 5 years excepting emergency such as famine and disaster relief ?Would African/s die in their millions?<br /><br />Unborn African children will still be repaying Aid borrowed by us in 50 years to come.

B001E7X4M4|5.0|Chock full of creative riffing and infused with power, The March commands your attention from the very start.  I have two other Unearth albums in addition to this one and like them all, but if I had to choose a favorite I would say, for me, there is a tie between The March and The Oncoming Storm.  Both are worthy titles if you are into Metalcore.    Next, the album art gives the impression of one fighting to break free.  It fits well with the music as you will see if you are following along with the included lyrics while you listen.    Lastly, if you loved The Oncoming Storm but didn't like III- In The Eyes Of Fire, I would say give The March a chance.  They do a really good job on this album, from front to back.  You won't want to skip any songs, which is a really good quality for an album to have.  It is clear that Unearth have a firm grasp of what it takes to rule the genre.  If you like Trevor Phipps' style of singing, and you like your music heavy, you must own The March.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|It is a very powerful story as it challanges how strong one stands with their own beliefs. Even though Sergent York believed in God and peace and saw the wrongness in taking another person's life, he came to see a bigger picture and that is that not everybody holds to that same belief, infact the the very things that we believe in and hold dear, the right and wrong as we know it can become threatened. What are we going to do about it?  This is the very heart of the movie, it is about putting aside our personal veiws to see a bigger picture, it is about not just giving verbal support, but about putting your life on the line of what you believe and understand, it is about standing up for what is right. It can cost, but it can also come with unexpected rewards. The fact that it is taken of a true story adds greatly to the richness and depth of the story.   The documentry side of this dvd package, adds to the veiwing of the movie and the story behind the movie. Overal the whole package is well put together and well worth watching.
1595141979|5.0|Rose is almost 18 and just about to graduate. Soon, she and her best friend Lissa will be free to live their lives. All she has to do is finish a few more months of her training as a dhamphir guardian and do her field test.     Yet, when she's faced with her field test, Rose freezes, seeing the ghost of Mason who died in Spokane fighting strigoi with her.     She doesn't tell anyone.  While Rose knows that vampires exist, she does not believe in ghosts. She does believe in ill effects from being shadow kissed and is concerned about this.    Matters get worse when she learns that Victor Dashkov, the Moroi who'd taken Lissa and even convinced his own daughter to turn Strigoi to save his life, is going on trial.  She believes she and the others who fought Victor should attend, but it seems at first only full guardians will be accorded that honor.    Oddly, the presence of ghosts does not bother her when she and Lissa are finally allowed to go to Court and the trial.  Just as she realizes why ghosts are plaguing her at school, strigoi attack the school and many of her friends are taken.    This is the hardest read of any of the Vampire Academy series so far and the most emotionally powerful.  One thing I can say about Richelle Mead is that her stories just keep getting better.     You can read this book without having read the first two in the series, but you might want to invest in all three. The stories are good and well worth the time if you enjoy supernatural fantasy.    Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie; I remember the reviews when it first came out and they were a little mixed.  I can see why because it's not your usual kind of vampire movie.  One thing I will caution about: it's very slooooow.  That kind of bothered me but I went with it. Foreign films often have a different kind of pacing from American ones.<br /><br />That said: I really enjoyed the movie in spite of the slowness.  It stayed with me for a long time after I watched it.  I went back and watched some scenes again after I read up on it here and on IMDB.  I did not find it predictable and that's a good thing in a vampire movie, since the topic has been done to death, so to speak.  I will admit I did not understand one of the key things about Eli until I read some stuff on IMDB.  (I just finished reading the book and it was explained there, but I felt it was unclear in the movie, as were several other plot points.)<br /><br />The movie is beautiful to look at, very good photography.  I thought the two young actors who played the leads were great.  There was a lot of honest emotion in the movie.  I felt emotionally connected to the characters in a way that I normally don't with this type of film.  One can't help feeling pity for Eli even while being horrified by what she is and does.<br /><br />I hear an American remake of this movie is on the way, which is probably unfortunate and which I'll probably skip, because it will most likely be loud, overly bloody, and poorly written.  We tend to ruin this type of film.<br /><br />I don't think this film is over-the-top gory compared to some vampire films but the squeamish might want to avoid it.<br /><br />Book compared to movie: I think the book explains some things better and there are some subplots that didn't make it into the movie that I enjoyed, but I would rate both about equally.  The film is beautiful and haunting, which the book can't really manage.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended, I am planning to buy it because I'd like to see it again.use I'd like to see it again.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|This is such a sordid movie with such sleazy characters that I'm surprised I enjoy watching it, but I do. Maybe I just find it fascinating. I mean, how often do you see an actor you know (Christian Bale) drop mega-pounds and wind up playing 122-pound man who is literally skin-and-bones?  Bale's next film had him as a buffed-up Batman. Go figure. Actors are a strange lot, to say the least.    This film is fascinating because of Bale and the involving storyline. You just HAVE to find out what this is all about, especially one strange character, once you start viewing. And, without giving anything away, the ending was outstanding, message-wise.    Jennifer Jason Leigh, who once again plays a foul-mouthed, low-morals character. At least she's consistent in her roles. Listening to her, the other profane characters and looking at the grotesque face and figure of the emaciated Bale, this DVD is not easy to take. Be forewarned. he ain't pretty to view. He has to be the poster boy for anorexia.    Yet, the film is still fascinating, well-photographed and certainly a unique story.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|This DVD-Audio 5.1 mix has become the new sonic standard by which all surround recordings should be measured.    From a music perspective there isn't much more to add (Hans Gruber review here is very good), it's Steven Wilson at its creative best - every song is beautifully conceived and executed.  But also the music was conceived from scratch in a way that it could really exploit surround sound.  I listened to the download of the album for about 12 times before I got this DVD-A.  As usual, Steven's songs grow on you with every listen, and you start to understand and enjoy them more over time.  However, what makes this album really shine is the 5.1 mix:    1.  The sounds balance between the front, center and rear speakers is impeccable  2.  The album explores the complete spectrum of the human capacity for audio, in many cases all sound frequencies (from very low to very high - almost as high as white noise) are beautifully displayed at the same time!  3.  Really noisy passages are followed by very quiet and haunting passages, the contrast is mind-numbing and beautiful  4.  When you play the album out loud, the workout that the subwoofer gets is unbelievable.  You better not have glass or breakable objects within distance!    Steven makes a point that in today's iPod generation, the true enjoyment of listening to an album with the right sound quality and fidelity, and enjoying the accompanying artwork has been lost.  Downloading individual songs can never transmit the ideas that the artist puts together when creating a concept album.  And even though downloads are getting better in terms of better sound quality options, they will never equal the awesome quality that Advanced Resolution surround gives you.    Well, Steven backs up with words with this masterpiece.  You can feel the countless number of hours that he spent conceving, writing, playing, mixing and producing the songs.  It is pure quality and pure magic.    If you don't have a 5.1 system (DVD-A or DVD-V DTS), go get a good one and play this album.  You will be amazed and you will never look at music the same way ever again!

1416909532|4.0|Well, i was skeptical about this book at first, as i am about most dating and self help books, after all, everyone is different right.    The fact is, women are nurturers, we tend to gloss over things and even  make excuses for men, many of us have been wrongly told how to interpret  men's behavior. Unbeknownst to me, a great many men would rather die than  hurt your feelings? Really? so that behavior that we call, sketchy, erratic, the distance, the tension, alot of times, (not all) he is trying to tell us something. If he is dismissive, unattentive, if he's not calling, if he's not showing us attention, he's just not that into you. I hate to say it but i saw myself in a great many of the letters written to the authors, I have made excuses and wasted time and well, just clung to that hope, because i wasn't able to interpret behavior, Often with men, the way they act is how things are, its that simple, It really is.    This book will save me alot of time in the future.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really dig this DVD. I use it almost every day.  The short, well-balanced workouts was the biggest selling point for me. Twenty minutes and you're done.  No matter how tired I was at the end of the day, I knew I could push through another twenty minutes.  And I feel so much better afterwards.     With this DVD, I now believe that I can incorporate exercise into my day for a healthier lifestyle.

B000TFINY6|5.0|This isn't actually a review. More of an inquiry: Has anyone ever asked why Season 3 of Lost has a list price of 96.99, while the three seasons are 69.99? Has there been a typo when entering the price into the system? Season 3 doesn't have more episodes than 1 and 2. From all the seasons of Lost, it has probably been the weakest. So why is it more expensive than the rest of them?

B0015OKWL2|5.0|I can recall seeing previews for this movie and thinking that I couldn't wait to see it.  After all it has Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, how could it be a bad movie.  Well the trend for movies now is that they are in the theater for five days before being pulled, so I never got a chance to see \\"Righteous Kill\\".  Then the DVD came out and it was bought for me by my girlfriend.<br /><br />Before I put the movie into my DVD player I recall all the negative praise I heard about this movie.  Many of the reviews called the movie a \\"dud\\", not good as [[ASIN:B0006J28KU Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] (the classic film that featured DeNiro and Pacino in 1995), predictable or just a lazy effort.  I confess I was a bit concerned that this movie was going to \\"suck\\".<br /><br />Upon completion of viewing \\"Righteous Kill\\" I was very, very pleased. The movie was about DeNiro and Pacino investigating a series of murders.  These murders involve all \\"criminals\\" that either \\"got off the hook\\" or \\"haven't got caught yet\\".  The crimes these delinquents have performed range from rape to drug dealing.  As both of these veteran cops dig deeper they discover the \\"killer\\" could be a cop/police officer.  There is a lot of misdirection in this film about who did or didn't do it.<br /><br />There is some criticism that the \\"serial killer\\" was painfully obvious.  I am not sure about all that.  I will admit the outcome of this movie wasn't the most original, but it didn't ruin the film for me.  I won't give the ending of the movie or spoil any details of this film.  I will say that it is very likely a viewer might have the mystery figured out before the denouement of the film arrives.<br /><br />What I found refreshing about this film was the acting and the grittiness of the subject matter.  Seeing DeNiro and Pacino together (again) was awesome.  I didn't feel that their acting was lacking substance or dull.  These are two classic actors and are still in their prime.  I felt their interaction made up for mundane film clich&eacute;s that could have transpired.  As for the supporting cast, that was excellent too. John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Carla Gugino, Brian Dennehy and even Curtis \\"50 Cent\\" Jackson did a good job.  This movie also presents a rather moral question about murder that you can almost smell a \\"Death Wish\\" movie.  This flick has a very intelligent edge to it, much more than you normal crime drama.<br /><br />I can't speak for why other people didn't like this film.  As for it being predictable, isn't 90% of every successful and box office smash predictable?  Look at romantic-comedies.  Perhaps the problem \\"Righteous Kill\\" faced was the prior catalogue both DeNiro and Pacino have, including \\"Heat\\".  Now in juxtaposition \\"Heat\\" is a better movie than \\"Righteous Kill\\".  However the latter does feature more screen time between DeNiro and Pacino and this is what makes this movie work.  I am glad I took a chance on this movie and didn't listen to \\"critical acclaim\\" because I thought it was awesome.  There are worst ways a person could spend an hour and forty minutes.that could have transpired.  As for the supporting cast, that was excellent too.

B001DU8T6I|5.0|Watch out Miley Cyrus- you have a run for your money.    Most people remember Demi Lovato from the hit Disney Channel movie, Camp Rock. With her debut album, we see how vocally gifted this girl is.     I love how she can effortlessly use her voice to emphasize the most important lyrics in a song. Her singing and her lyrics can empower you (\\"Believe in Me\\"). They can also make you feel her sadness (\\"Don't Forget\\"). She puts emotion into her singing, and you can feel her pain or happiness.    This is a CD I haven't stopped listening to since it was released. My favorite songs include: Trainwreck, The Middle, and La La Land.    In my opinion, Demi won't fade out like those other Disney Stars. I think we can expect great things from this new rising Disney star, and I think she's here to stay.

1439102813|5.0|Alzheimer's has become a common topic and seems to touch as many families as cancer.  Just about everything out there in movies and fiction is from the perspective of the family, the caregivers and those left to keep moving forward with their own lives.  Still Alice is different.      This is Alzheimer's from inside the mind of someone afflicted with the disease.  If you take anything away from this book it should be that what really matters in the end is the people you touched and those you really shared your life with.  Your job can and will be filled by someone else.  It's family and those who you've built real relationships with that will be there when you are no longer the person you might be today.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Marley has an interesting history that is reflected in his music.  It is a history that advances from the earliest music to as far as I've managed (end of second of four discs).  While there are changes, some of the musical themes stay over the first two discs.  I've become interested enough to finish listening to the four discs and then to do some reading on Marley.  He is an interesting guy, conflicted, but intentional and purposeful in how he approached life and his music.    The set of his music is fascinating.  I'll have additional thoughts later when I'm done listening to the entire set.
1416595546|5.0|I'm not a big reader, and had this book passed on to me as one worth reading.  I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed it - an easy read, and found it hard to put down.  The main character certainly keeps you on your toes... what decisions and thoughts will she have next.  A sad ending.
B00140PK6O|5.0|How wonderful to receive this as a gift. Buy it for someone who has a sincere appreciation for fine BBC viewing. Excellent cast, excellent story. Everyone's review is accurate. Surprise someone, and buy it for them. They will love it.
B0000AZKLF|5.0|How cool it must have been for SRV to sit down and play with his hero and key influence, Albert King. Usually these so called jam sessions end up as a letdown, but not here. Blues at Sunrise is a 15 minute tour de force and T-Bone had nothing on this take of Stormy Monday. Every other song is equally impressive, including Stevie's own Pride and Joy. Sound is excellent.
B000063CPL|5.0|Not a lot needs to be said about this, because words do not describe how amazing it is. Bruce sounds better than ever, he uses his raspy style on some songs and it works really well. Gers, Murray, and Smith all sound amazing here, they simply prove that they are the guitar gods. 'Arry is TOP NOTCH here, he really gives one hell of a performance, and Nicko... words fail me, he truly is the greatest drummer ever. And that said, this is the greatest live CD of all time. The band play for their lives here, and really it's one hell of a live performance that you will be listening to for hours and hours and days and months and so on. Best tracks here are Brave New World, The Trooper, and... well, ALL the songs, really!!!! So DO buy this album. You will be glad you did.
B000002BYA|5.0|This disc, recorded the day after SRV's birthday live at Carnegie Hall, is probably my favorite Stevie Ray album (I own them all). He seems to be in a much better frame of mind than on Live Alive (not nearly as wasted), and it definately shows in his playing. The only quibbles I have with this CD is that it doesn't contain Voodoo Child and The Sky is Crying, both of which were part of the show and are thankfully to be found on disc 2 of the SRV box set. And the acoustics of Carnegie Hall are more suited to classical music, so the sound is a tad murky, but not to the point of being a nuisance. A great disc by my favorite guitarist ever, may he rest in peace.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|This, in my very humble opinion, was the best movie of 2008. It's one to be revisited over and over. An instant classic.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|To get 8 discs of music of this quality at around $30 is a steal. DG is usually notorious for over pricing their single CD's (usually around $18 a pop, so this is indeed a very pleasant surprise. Then when you consider that the discs contain the mercurial, hot tempered, fire breathing dragoness in her prime it is simply a must buy. Of course, Argerich falls into the same category as other artists such as Heifetz, Pollini, Szell, Karajan, Furtwangler and others in that there is very little middle ground. You either love them or you hate them. I happen to be a huge fan of not only her solo work, but also her concertos and chamber works. I am continually amazed at her ability to play at such breakneck speeds without glossing over or bluring notes, even during live performances, the way some pianists (Horowitz) do. Of course there are the occasional missed keys, but who doesn't make a few miscues from time to time? Even the great Richter is guilty of this. All said, there isn't a disc in this set that isn't very good to great. Did I mention what an excellent bargain this box set was?

Events begin to unfold and Rorschach is the first person to see a connection and threat.<br /><br />The unstable world peace is upended and the now retired heroes must try to solve this mystery. 'Watchmen' is a great story of power and control. What cost would yo upay for world peace? Who watches the Watchmen?<br /><br />This graphic novel is not for kids. The story and art are adult in nature. Another great aspect of the graphic novel is the back story of the 'Tales of the Black Freighter' and the non-comic information after each comic issue.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|The gaming access of this keypad is principally as  a very good tool.It allows for macros to be applied with ease during the process of a game.After plugging it in, installing  the software, the display tools are phenomenal.It gives time, CPU and RAM, Latest news headlines, and many details more, and thats all before you start setting up the game macros.You can, if you wish, pre-programe the macros, but the main utility as I found it in the games I applied it to, is that the macros can be set up as you play.This is accomplished by pressing a free \\"G\\" key on the G13, and then it prompts you to enter the keyboard commands, and then you press MR ( one of the buttons on the second lower row below the display) and then press the same free \\"G\\" key and the Macro is saved to memory.  As I applied it, you basically fill as much as is useful, whilst still having  the mouse in your \\"Dominant\\" hand ( assuming you are either left or right handed ; this of course is a redundant statement if you are ambidextrous), and the G13 can be used in place of your mouse for the duration of the game, and the mouse can swap easily if it is wireless.    What would push this excellent Gaming device even more is a wireless version, but as it is, its a superb item, and fits great with the G5 and G9 series of Gaming Mouses ( both Cabled as far as I am currently aware).The Unit is stylish, comfortable and easy to use; easy on the hand and on the eye.  I am myself essentially a basic gamer, but after talking with some more advanced gamers, they all agreed that this unit took some other items much further than they currently use, and they are keen to get their hands on a new G13 as soon as possible. May you have many happy Gaming hours, especially with the side toggle controls, a feature I mention only briefly, but which I am sure will be made extensive use of by more advanced gamers.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|...but it was certainly fun to watch in the theatre.    This movie apparently didn't do all that well at the box-office and the reviews were certainly mixed.  I suppose I can see why.  It's maybe a bit longer than it absolutely needs to be and the story is a bit far-fetched.  But, hell, it's a MOVIE.  And I believe that 'a movie' is exactly what it set out to be: a great big, old-fashioned epic with lovely photography, good-looking leading players, a cute kid and a whole lot of running around all over the place.  And that's exactly what I went into the theatre expecting to see. I wasn't disappointed.  So if you're in the mood for 'a movie' and want to spend some time looking at pretty moving  pictures of pretty people doing all manner of movie-star stuff, 'Australia' should be right up your alley.  But if you're looking for something subtle and artistic, buy something from The Criterion Collection and put on your thinking-cap.  Just depends on what you're in the mood for.
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|I find myself experiencing two schools of thought when it comes to the CUBE series. On the one hand, they are all poorly acted, with mostly redundant plots and predictable dialogue. On the other hand, their structures are so blatantly philosophical, so unabashadly symbolic, it's kind of a treat to sit back and fiddle with the concepts it represents. Sorta the same way you'd fill in a few of the boxes on a crossword puzzle you know you're never going to finish. It's addictive like that; a plate of cheese that people talk around even as they pick it apart.<br /><br />And if you're wondering if these plates have the kind of cheese you like, then this review is for you.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00008H2L0 Cube]] - People wake up in a labyrinthine cube with no idea of how they got there or why they've been kidnapped. They must navigate through a series of deadly traps, without knowing just what it is they're headed for (or even where it is). A doctor, a famous escapist, a cop, a mentally handicapped fella -- personalities clash, and what could've been a tight little parable of existentialism becomes a squabbling social commentary about the brutality of big, mean men. It's tense, but not paced particularly well, although the ending has a thankful spot of hope. Like the Rubik's Cube, most people will find this cube compelling for a few twists and turns, but are unlikely to find the ending all that rewarding. 3 1/2 stars.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00008DDVY Cube 2 - Hypercube]] - The cube has gone hyper! Dimensional that is. Gone is the first cube's relentless dankness, replaced here by sterile, unapologetic white. Although the new cube is also fraught with hidden perils, these are mostly of the multidimensional variety. What this means for you, the viewer, is that the traps are now CGI contraptions that look not convincing in the least. It also means that many rooms have their own gravity and \\"variable time speeds.\\" Oh, I almost forgot, the most awesome thing it means is that it exists in multiple dimensions at once, so there are apparently about fifteen different copies of each person wandering around at the same time.<br /><br />Did I say \\"awesome\\"? I'm sorry. I meant \\"unfortunate.\\" Because this cube has basically no rules, virtually anything can happen, making what DOES happen less important in the long run. We've got some crazy characters -- a senile physicist, a blind girl, a private detective, a video game desinger and a lawyer -- and they all have connections with a scary-big corporation named Izon, but who cares? The least plot driven of the three movies, this film is also the darkest (in spite of how well-lit each frame is). And, of course, it succumbs to the same mistake as the first film. Instead of being about the little people coming to terms with the bizarre futility of their circumstances, it devolves into a big man going crazy and chasing everyone around with a knife. 2 stars.<br /><br />CUBE ZERO - I don't know why they called this CUBE ZERO instead of CUBE CUBED. Maybe it's supposed to be a prequel, but I doubt it. It's possible they just thought \\"zero\\" sounded better than \\"three.\\" Or maybe it's because, for the first time ever, the viewer is treated to life outside of the cube.<br /><br />Don't worry. The cube is still there, just as gloomy and lethal as ever (and in far more vividly gross ways), but the group of people inside the box are at least as important as the people watching them. The watchers in this case are a couple of be-jumpsuited guys named Wynn and Dodd who sit around, play chess, and record people's dreams. These guys give the series a chance to do some more overt navel-gazing, but the end effect isn't that bad, even if it mostly just feels like a Pinter play. Specifically, THE DUMBWAITER. (Read it. It's good.)<br /><br />Still, no matter how full of dread and terror his plays were, Pinter always kept the terrible and dreaded things off-stage. When Wynn begins to question his duties, eventually taking drastic measures to get some answers, he causes chaos in and out of the cube. Enter three of the dreaded higher-ups. An effete and over-acted character named Jax pops in, followed closely by two well-groomed go-fers. (Everytime Jax talked to them, I could swear he was calling them Thin and Quickly, but the credits list them as Finn and Quigley.) They are heralded with whimsically creepy violin music, like an incidental theme song, and although they aren't fooling around, their presence makes the whole thing far less ominous than it normally would.<br /><br />Still, the wackiness they provde is menacing and self-assured, and it disguises a story with far more heart and smarts than its predecessors. Even if the story contains, yet again, a big, angry man chasing people around, that is a minor part of the much larger, much more hopeful picture. Satisfying in a lot of ways, this film also pays homage to fans who've endured the films from the beginning. 4 starsout of the cube. Enter three of the dreaded higher-ups.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I just finished watching Let The Right One In and I was impressed,especially with the actors who played Oscar and Eli(the fact Eli is able to finish a Rubik's Cube is impressive)      The movie says a lot without being overly gory,unike past films in the genre.Some may be a bit weirded out between one particular scene between Eli and Oscar,but (not giving away any plot points here) there's a logical reason that the relationship is purely platonic.    Sweden is used well as a backdrop for the film(during the time the movie takes place,there is almost always snow on the ground)    The last few minutes of the film are jarring(the scene  at the pool is one to make you go \\"Oh.My.God.\\"). The ending is a bit up in the air(I wouldn't be surprised if there's a sequel in a few years' time).It'll be interesting to see what the American remake is like.

1932907009|5.0|This morning on ESPN radio, 710am in Los Angles, Colin Cowherd talked about  SAVE THE CAT.  Colin's point was this:  A sports team needs a direction.  He talked about the New York Jets, that they have no direction, where as The Giants, The Steelers, other winning teams do.  Late into the season, when the games get harder and more important,  direction is invaluable.    Colin said what he learned in Save The Cat he can use to  analyze a sports team.     In screenwriting, the writer will get lost without direction. By page eleven you might forget what your story is about. How do you keep on your path?  In Save the Cat direction is accomplished by giving the screenplay a title before you begin the first scene.    Even if this is only a working title it doesn't matter, just keep it related to the story you originally had in mind. When you get lost read the title.      This is a good point as screenplays and movies often start out really interesting, act two starts to lose it, and by act three it's a complete failure because the author lost direction. Now what Colin got out of the book might seem too simple, and I guess it is. But that's just one aspect of this highly readable screenplay writing guide.  The book is full of these tips.    Blake Snyder has written many movies, and sold more.  He was at Barns and Noble a few months ago for a signing.  This guy is a giving, caring person, the type who's a born teacher, no huge ego who's written a writing book to show off. He truly cares about your writing, and invites you to email him about any questions you might have. The most important thing is his book reflects his desire for you to succeed and therefor he does't hold back or try to get you into some on line workshop to fill his wallet. His email is in the book.
0375826726|1.0|This is not a review of the book.  The only purpose of this paragraph is to let others know that the book is not worth the time. It is way too wordy and boring.

0312539517|3.0|I first read about George Leigh Mallory and Andrew Irvine in late 1951 or early 1952 in \\"Children's Digest\\" magazine (this was before Mt. Everest was successfully scaled) and I have been fascinated with their story ever since.<br /><br />Thus, I was really looking forward to reading this new [[ASIN:B002M3SP28 Paths of Glory]] book by best-selling author Jeffrey Archer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the event, I was slightly disappointed. Now I must first say that I tend to be a \\"nit-picker\\" when it comes to historical events and, in general, I am not keen on novelizations of historical events or personalities so, perhaps, I was expecting too much.<br /><br />The best novelization of an historical event I have ever read is [[ASIN:0679643249 The Killer Angels: A Novel of the Civil War (Modern Library)]] (the movie version is [[ASIN:B00003CXA6 Gettysburg (Widescreen Edition)]]) in which the author, in a preface, explains that only the conversations were invented (he states also that some events were slightly compressed and certain minor personalities were a composite of several people) but that all the situations depicted actually occurred as written.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer makes no such explanation here and it was obvious to me that certain events MUST have been \\"imagined.\\" To clarify the situation in my own mind, I wrote to Mr. Archer and I received a kind and detailed reply from an associate which confirmed my thoughts. I also mentioned one or two misstatement of facts which appeared in the \\"Advance Readers' Edition\\" sent to me by Amazon; according to the reply I received, these have been corrected in the final published edition which, unfortunately, I have not yet seen in order to actually compare the two.<br /><br />I shall not detail the fanciful situations - this would be a \\"spoiler\\" and might mar some peoples' enjoyment of the book - but, frankly, they annoyed me; I do not feel that this sort of thing belongs in an historical novel. Others will disagree with me.<br /><br />I suggested that Mr. Archer would have done well to include an \\"Author's Note\\" of explanation and his associate wrote that others had suggested this as well but Mr. Archer chose to not do this.<br /><br />I think this is a poor choice because, should people regard this novel as an actual biography of George Leigh Mallory, it does his reputation an undeserved injustice. I hope Mr. Archer will reconsider at some point and at least post a note of clarification on his web site.<br /><br />There is also at least one anachronism (a word used) which, according to the associate, was brought to Mr. Archer's attention during the editing process, but he chose to leave it in. It was somewhat grating to me.<br /><br />There are also a few grammatical errors (in the Advance Readers' Edition) which may or may not have been corrected; several of them are questionable (I may be wrong in my assessment).<br /><br />All that being said, I actually found the novel to be enjoyable. Because of the above \\"nits,\\" I couldn't help having a continual nagging feeling during my reading of it; most other people, not being as picky as I am, will not feel this way.<br /><br />The book is fast-paced, quite interesting, and it will hold the reader's attention through to the end. It certainly held mine! I understand that Mr. Archer is hoping that a movie will be made of his book; I hope so too. If handled correctly, it will be a \\"corker!\\"<br /><br />To this day, no one knows definitely if Mallory (and Irvine) ever reached the top of Mt. Everest. It may be that no one will ever know. Mr. Archer has his own theory (which, however, is not in line with the latest theories of experienced climbers) and it forms the ending of the story. Regardless, Mallory and Irvine definitely did not \\"conquer\\" Mt. Everest; in order to achieve that, you must reach the top AND you must get back down to the bottom - alive!<br /><br />As a novel, I think that most people will enjoy it. Even if ultimately forgettable (and only time can confirm that opinion), it will bring many people quite a bit of pleasure.<br /><br />I regard it in the same way I regard [[ASIN:0060935499 Amadeus: A Play by Peter Shaffer]] and its movie equivalent [[ASIN:B00006DEFA Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. It's not true but it IS fun.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes fast-paced adventure (and suspense) novels.egard [[ASIN:0060935499 Amadeus: A Play by Peter Shaffer]] and its movie equivalent [[ASIN:B00006DEFA Amadeus - Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].

I should also say that I was a student in Wing Chun (Wing Tsun) for a few years, and the fact that this movie is about one of the most famous of all in the Wing Chun genealogy (first teacher of Bruce Lee)did also spark my interest as well.

It's never to late to catch up on the classics!<br /><br />After finishing \\"Of Mice and Men\\" my first reaction was that it was a very fast read, and it was a bit overhyped.  I found Steinbeck's writing style a bit choppy, not an easy read (meaning the true-to-life exchanges were both irritating and believable).<br /><br />After a week of reflection, I am beginning to appreciate the work more, and can understand the \\"classic\\" classification.  Some of the content is coarse for middle school, and it may have been intentionally left off the reading list (or perhaps kept out of the library) of my Virginia school, but I recommend (re)reading this one as an adult.

B000OF0GB4|5.0|If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.  -  William Blake.    This book, _The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell_, first published in 1954, consists of two books written by Aldous Huxley which reveal his investigations into the human mind and human consciousness as well as his experiences with psychedelic substances.  Huxley delves deeply into the experiences of the artists and the mystics as well as the experience of madness and schizophrenia (mimicked he believed by certain states induced through hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD-25).  This book was particularly popular during the 1960s and with the counter-culture.  Aldous Huxley (1894 - 1963) was a British born author and thinker who explored regions of human consciousness, and examined spiritual and mystical experience.  Huxley is perhaps best known for his novel _Brave New World_ which examined the rise of the modern totalitarian and scientifically managed state.  Huxley lived for a time in the United States in southern California where he had dealings with the American Indians there and in New Mexico.  This book offers a study of some of his own experiences with altered states of consciousness induced partially by hallucinogenic drugs and their relationship to the experiences of the artists and mystics.    The first book included in this book is _The Doors of Perception_ (1954) which details Huxley's experiences with the psychedelic and consciousness altering drug mescaline.  The title for this book comes from the poem by William Blake.  To begin with Huxley notes that in 1886, the German pharmacologist Louis Lewin published his study on the cactus Anhalonium Lewinii which has been used extensively by the Indians of the American Southwest.  Huxley relates the experience of the drug to that of schizophrenia and madness as understood by the \\"alienists\\".  Huxley then relates how in 1953 he came to take mescaline and explains the altered states of consciousness it induced.  Huxley relates these experiences to those of the mystics such as Meister Eckhart, the Buddhist concept of the Dharma-Body and Zen Buddhism, Platonic philosophy, as well as the notion of the \\"Mind at Large\\".  Huxley also relates his experiences to those of the artists, such as Vermeer and Cezanne, and to those of musicians such as Mozart.  Huxley explains how the ability to \\"think straight\\" is not altered under the influence of the drug, but how visualization and visual imagery is greatly improved.  Huxley ends by relating his experiences to those of some of the other drugs and the peyote cultists, as well as the angelology of for example St. Thomas Aquinas.    The second book included in this book is _Heaven and Hell_ (1956) which is a philosophical work detailing the relationship between bright colors and the artists as well as psychoactive substances and mystical philosophy.  Huxley examines the \\"antipodes\\" or regions of the mind that can be reached through the use of psychoactive substances, vitamin deficiencies, meditation, self-flagellation, or fasting.  Huxley begins by relating the vast regions of the human mind to be discovered to those of the zoologist and the geographer.  He notes that the mind still has its dark continents like Africa which have yet been discovered.  Huxley relates mystical experiences within Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam to bright colors found amongst the artists.  In particular, Huxley notes the influence of the Platonic philosophy.  Huxley relates much of this to art, ranging from medieval cathedrals to Rembrandts to Chinese paintings.  The book ends relating this to madness and schizophrenia as well as mystical experience and modern spiritualism.  The book follows by several appendices focusing on such things as visionary experience induced through carbon dioxide and the stroboscopic lamp, medieval Christian theology and the importance of mystical experience in the life of the medieval individual,the \\"Mind at Large\\", the importance of art in various forms and the importance of color, painting in particular and the Renaissance use of fireworks, the use of mescaline and LSD-25, schizophrenia and madness, and the novel _Sartor Resartus_ by Carlyle.    This book offers two interesting and beautifully written essays in the study of human consciousness and the human mind.  Indeed, Huxley's work was to have an important influence on later explorers of the human mind particularly with the rise of the counter-culture.  Huxley's experiments in mysticism and with psychoactive substances were to prove highly detailed and interesting for the study of the relationship of the human being to God and the spiritual nature of man.
1594481717|5.0|I've read half of the book, and so far I find it very interesting and an easy read.  I'm in the middle of grad school, and reading tons of information on brain research.  This book is a breeze compared to all of that!  It presents some ideas to consider about creativity, the direction our world is going, and the role our nation and children will play in that.  Pink was a speaker at the Texas Music Educators Convention this past February which inspired me to order the book (through Amazon rather than pay convention prices!).  I BELIEVE you can go to [...] and find a link to his speech.  Pink presents facts and data in an easy-to-read manner, and keeps the interest of the reader.  He also finds that delicate balance between humor and hard-core data.  Honestly, it is hard to put it down!  I also gave the principal of my school a copy...it never hurts to thank an administrator for their hard work, or remind them how important your subject area is.

B00140PK6O|5.0|They did a wonderful job bringing these books to life.  The acting is perfect and the dialog does a good job of telling the story.  We fall in love with the characters on the screen just as we did when reading the books.  I love the progress versus tradition angle in many books.  This really had a nice balance of differing viewpoints and such a colorful and classic variety of important characters.  Each character is given the appropriate amount of personal quirks and flaws to tell the complete and deep story. I don't think they shortchanged anyone in this adaptation.  I will watch this again probably several times.  The DVD is good quality with clear picture and sound, and I am pleased to own it.

Seems to have been written with colleagues and scholars in mind rather than students - an overly magniloquent vomit of knowledge daring any other to match the comprehensiveness of the text has ultimately resulted in an unnecessarily prolixic information minestrone soup that will even have biochemistry professors spooning twice.     [I happen to dislike minestrone soup but for those that yum I will not go so far as to suggest trying it, as it is a considerable amount of money for a bowl of soup, but I will ask you to contact Voet and Voet and shower them with compliments on how au fait this publication sounded so that the next time they write a textbook they can focus on making it more digestible for the biochemistry Nh.D. (No-have degree)]    - The illustrations could have easily been more intuitive    - Takes more effort than should be necessary to comprehend the language - the material is quite understandable, however.    Excerpt: \\"The bond to [alpha-]C in the plane perpendicular to the PLP pi-orbital system (from X in the illustration) is labile as a consequence of its overlap with the pi system, which permits the broken bond's electron pair to be delocalized over the conjugated molecule.\\" (p.999)    Simply put,     \\"The alpha-C - X bond is adaptable because its electrons can be delocalized over the PLP pi-orbital system.\\"

The story line is tragic, but I felt no empathy for anyone.  The characters had some depth, but she didn't pull off a believable Chris or Emily to me.    She kills herself because she's knocked up?  At least make it easy-to-swallow.  I could feel empathy if she had been molested and knocked up by her abusive father.  But to come from two loving, supportive families and the fact that she convinced her boyfriend who loved her unconditionally to kill her with a gun without giving a reason--- completely not plausible.    Boo.  I'd rather vomit spaghetti sauce and orange juice than read this book again.

Of course I understand this is one person's perspective and one person's experience, but still I learned so much. I would highly recommend this book, if for no other reason than it is entertaining and you'll get to learn about a remarkable woman.

0765350386|5.0|This is one of the best books I read in a while. The new creative twist in regards to magic and characters gets you hooked. The story moves at a good pace developing characters and the story line, detail rich without being boring. Well done...
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Now, I have not seen this new version of Woodstock. But since the entire short promo film at the Amazon website is about the small fixes that needed to be made to the bonus footage, I feel that the producers are doing the right thing. If they tried to hide the fact that they had to overdub and tried to con us, I would be bitter and turned off entirely (once work leaked.) Material was left on the chopping floor 39 years ago (and then againg for every transfer since) for a reason. Something about that material was flawed. Bad mics, bad PA, some operator did not hit the record button on time and so on. If repairs can be made on new footage then let it come. If the performance is good and todays's technology can repair other flaws fine. The original film will always exist.
B00005JOA0|5.0|At first there was a great marital relationship between the two couples.  He refused to acknowledge that his wife had dignity.  Her kindness and compasion was not important to him.  He was very bold and ungrateful.  Stolen from her happiness and feeling betrayed, forced her to leave the house with their son. I am glad this movie had a decent ending.
0316001821|5.0|On April 16, 2005, my world changed when my father was tragically killed. I was a thousand miles away and still cannot describe the pain. A good friend of mine gave me a copy of The Lovely Bones and I know that reading it when I did, brought me from the brink of a deep depression and retreat from life!     Although I did not get it right away since the story itself did not seem relevant to my own situation, after reading it a second time, I realized the message was simple: we can survive anything and God truly has a plan in everything, and never gives us more than we can bear. Basically, it was  a reminder that there is indeed a better place and knowing that made losing my father more bearable.    [[ASIN:0316001821 The Lovely Bones: Deluxe Edition]]
B00129H7VS|5.0|This DVD set contains just what one hears from in the media...this truly was the \\"greatest generation\\". From lives of every day workers, in a country not directly involved with the goings on of the rest of the world, we were ambushed by a small Asian country and thrown into the worst two wars ever created by man. The lives of the men of the \\"Band of Brothers\\" are explained for all of us to question just which of these men led the life I would have had I been in that era. The closeness Ambrose explained of each individual in the book to the way he was portrayed on film is wonderful. I was in each battle and felt for each man in his own situation. Really a wonderful lesson for all to see war as it is and hope we never experience anything like it again.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Finally! A really good and really origional movie! This is one of the only horror movies to be released in the last couple of years that has not been a remake or a sequel - and it is very good!<br />A woman named Rose's daughter has nightmares in which she sleepwalks and shouts of a place named Silent Hill. Concerned about her daughter, the two of them make a trip to Silent Hill to find out the source of the sleepwalking. However, in a car accident shortly after having arrived on the outskirts of Silent Hill Roses' daughter, Sharon, disapppears and so Rose embarks, alone, upon her journey through the nightmareish hell that is Silent Hill...<br />This movie is suspencefull, frightening and origional and I would reccomend it to all fans of the genre.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is a very fitting \\"corrective\\" to Dylan's mixed experience with Danny Lanois and his black boxes and Acadian sonic shaman act. Dylan went on the road, sharpened his chops and then recorded a straightforward barn-burner. Every cut has its own charms but my favorites are Lonesome Day Blues, High Water (a prescient Katrina ditty?) and Moonlight. Dylan sounds courtly and world-weary and right at home in the clean, buzzing mix. High times.
B00005JLK1|5.0|This movie is by the same person as THIRTEEN GHOSTS and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (the 1999 remake) and it is very similar to those two movies so if you enjoyed them, you will probably enjoy this.<br />The opening scene is probably the best scene in this movie and probably moves it from a fourstar to a fivestar movie, it is a must-see. After this scene, I expected the rest of the movie 2 be very gorey but this was the only moment of gore. Usually this would put me off but the rest of the movie had some pretty cool spooky/creepy moments which prevented it from becoming boreing. Also it has a good twist in the end.<br />A good movie if your a fan of horror - in particular ghost or body count movies.
B000MCIBB6|2.0|This album, like all the remixes, is way over produced. There's reverb cranked up like crazy. Jim's voice is double tracked in places where it wasn't before. Stuff that was not meant to be heard in the original (like morrison humming in Wintertime) is mixed up to the front.    The new mixes lack the power of the originals. The Doors were a live band and this stuff lacks that sense of a live, raw performance. Like many \\"special editions\\" that seek to \\"improve\\" on the original, I can only hope that the originals will remain available along side the new takes. In a few years people will want them as bad as they want the untouched Star Wars movies now.

1427206031|5.0|I am not an avid reader (just because too much is always happening in my life), but when I heard what this book/cd was about, I was intrigued.  When I do decide to pick up a CD, it is usually a biography, or some sort of history. Being an historical fiction book on CD, it had a bit of both. I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B0001906O0|5.0|You found them!  Some mega repetition of some songs though, dub versions, dance versions over and over again, but ultimately.......it's gooooooooood!
B00026WU82|5.0|Smack in the center of the two-dozen-or-so albums of the 1960s that changed and redefined both rock `n' roll and Western culture, are the three albums whipped off by Bob Dylan right after he \\"went electric.\\" Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966) form an escalating trilogy of realization, transformation and power that are simply unmatched anywhere else in the music. If you do not have all three of these mind-blowing epics, you are simply doomed not to understand the conceptual genesis and limits of late twentieth-century art, nor do you have an adequate standard by which to make judgements, even up to this day.     While the palm usually goes to Blonde on Blonde for being the most extreme statement a popular artist has ever made, Highway 61 Revisited probably packs the most awesome, powerful wallop. It is the most dynamic and viscerally relentless of the three. It begins with Dylan's most dizzying, category-changing shot of his career, \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" arguably the greatest rock song ever written, and then proceeds to become strangely more intense as it goes along.     \\"Strangeness\\" is a wonderful but inadequate word for this music. Dylan digs deeply into the collective unconsciousness of folk music and applies it directly to a new electric form that applies precisely to the moment of its creation. Miraculously, by doing so, he radically alters it and defines it. That \\"strangeness\\" is embodied perfectly in the magnificently taunting \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" where Dylan challenges his listeners to rise up and attempt to comprehend the implications of what they are hearing.     By metaphorically shifting ordinary categories of thought into a hard-blown, electric, apocalyptic vision, this music manages to be both honestly descriptive as well as  transformative. As Dylan recreates himself - and music - right before our eyes and ears, we are, in a large sense, recreated ourselves. Once the extraordinary vision ofthis music captures your imagination and spirit, you become permanently transformed. It doesn't work for everyone, but if you want to know why Bob Dylan is so damned important, this is precisely the place to come to find out.     Ultimately, this is why Dylan has the reputation of being the \\"spokesman for his generation\\" - since so many people who heard this got their consciousness permanently altered, including the Beatles and the Stones. As much as Dylan needed the early `60s rock explosion to ignite his flame, I promise you there would not have been a late-60's counterculture had it not been for Bob Dylan.     Even placing this music in its proper historical and cultural context is too limiting to define it. The playing, the lyrics, the singing on this album is timeless and awe inspiring. This is music older than the hills, yet futuristic beyond comprehension. Highway 61 is a marker, a monument - an unshakable reference point for measuring the maturity of all popular music, both before or since. This is why Sgt. Pepper became necessary for the Beatles to remain valid. This is why punk rock had to happen. This is the reason that Frank Zappa had a place to enter popular culture on any level whatsoever. And it goes without saying that this is why anything else Dylan himself has done matters so much - or even at all.     Throughout his eighteen-month creative explosion, Dylan tore down all the walls, rewrote all the rules and gave a new meaning to the idea of conceptual reality through music and the genius of his unflinching vision. This album still has that same power to transform - and it steamrolls the listener like a prophetic force of nature.
158270208X|5.0|After watching the DVD and putting into practice The Laws of Attraction I was thrilled that one of my friends who was equally enthusiastic about The Secret as me, recommended this beautiful journal.<br /><br />It helps to keep me focused on the positive to attract the correct things I desire in my life.  It's a daily reminder that being negative doesn't get you anywhere - no matter how bad the situation may be.  I write in it almost daily and take it with me traveling.  It's compact, well designed and it's beautiful.  Well worth every penny!!!<br /><br />And let me just say, for the reviewer here that mentioned \\"wouldn't a spiral notebook work just as well?\\"  Well.......... Not really.  It's the perfect setting to record your thoughts and it has beautiful quotations interspersed throughout the journal.  I will say...... If you can afford to buy a real Chanel bag - then you will - otherwise you will have to go for the $20 copy!  `Nuf said!!!

B000000HU0|5.0|And I mean that as a compliment!  Gong is actually an *extremely* original band.  This band takes psychedelic rock and mixes it with jazz, quality vocal melodies, a variety of rich musical instruments to create what I like to call (and not meant as an insult I hope you understand) circus music.  Hey if being trapped inside a pinball machine is a weird analogy... how about being trapped inside a slot machine building!  Imagine all those winning buzzers and dings going off at the same time, haha.  That's the impression an album like Shamal can give off.<br /><br />However there's a secret to all this- this band is actually pure genius.  Both the Pierre Moerlen and the Daevid Allen version of the band.  Tight songwriting, amazing vocal melodies, tasteful instrumental parts, competent, creative and always interesting (the saxophone jams in particular) and well, it's not all clown tricks, tightrope walking, elephants eating peanuts and tiptoeing while doing hulahoop tricks people!  No doubt the actual presence of the xylophone and the marimba to name just a couple musical instruments are responsible for such a colorful, vibrant and unique sound... and the pinball machine reference which I refuse to change, haha.<br /><br />\\"Wingful of Eyes\\" has some Brian Eno-like vocals that are quite good.  The entire melody is really wonderful.  The flutes serve mostly as background music, similar to shopping for plants and hearing flutes over the radio.  Yeah that's not very realistic but whatever.  Moving along!  The rest of the song is pretty basic by Gong's standards but I love it.  We're moving towards the jazzier period of the band's next chapter anyway so a song like this is probably well past the psychedelic period of the 70's and feels out of place a little bit.  It's more like pop/rock to be honest.  The guitar playing is really splendid, though.  I LOVE the lyrics.  \\"There is a feeling we all know, something happened long ago, when you remember who you were, makes you whatyou are today\\" and the catchy groovy way he sings \\"Your eyes are wise, you're wise, you're wise\\" on a downbeat loop with a clever use of xylophone while this is occurring.<br /><br />\\"Chandra\\" has some MAGNIFICENT saxophone playing!  Almost as good as the stuff from \\"Isle of Everywhere\\", a song I consider Gong's greatest moment ever.  That's a pretty high compliment you gotta admit!  I love the lyrics too.  \\"Did you get it!  Did you get it!  You're just another fish in the sea, yeah!\\"  That line is so hilarious but extremely catchy and deliberate too.  I love it to pieces, haha.  The synthesizer and xylophones are sort of mysterious too.  The violin is short, but awesome.  I LOVE the melody when the singer sings these words \\"You try, you fly when you're high\\" and \\"You're low, you know, you grow to flow\\".  The way the end fades away is AMAZING!  What is that instrument playing?  The gong can be heard in the background but some kind of keyboard I think is playing a weird melody.  Best ending to a song ever perhaps!<br /><br />\\"Bambooji\\" is INCREDIBLE!  The Asian vibes are immediately noticeable with the flutes in the beginning.  The instrumental portions of this song are *so* *darn* *amazing*.  I mean it.  The danceable way the flutes chug to the drums and rhythm is really awesome.  The xylophone never sounded better for the band.  I actually CRY MY EYES OUT during the Mike Oldfield-like conclusion of this song with the chugging flutes especially when it picks up the pace *just enough* to make me react to it.  React like a baby crying!  I haven't the slightest clue what \\"Bambooji\\" means but I suppose it's a type of grass, hehe.  That is, if you get rid of the last two letters.  Maybe a kind of grass that can be smoked, huh?  Let's ask the members of Gong!  There's some guitar soloing in this song that reminds me of the Chicago classic \\"25 or 6 to 4\\".  I mean, the guitarist really tears it up for a couple minutes!<br /><br />In \\"Cat In Clark's Shoes\\", BRILLIANT saxophone soloing stands out amongst chaotic chaos which, probably not surprising since this band has so much talent, makes you envision a cat sneaking around town late at night!  The sophisticated way the song is written must mean it's a sophisticated cat with fancy feast tastes, har har.  Two jokes wrapped in one there!  This song has so many tempo changes that it's hard to keep up with what's actually going on until you sink your tiger teeth in it a few times, but try your best to stick with it for the ultimate reward- that being the enjoyment factor.  Look beyond the goofy lyrics and the odd way the song is written and you'll hear the brilliance underneath it all.  If you can't well at the very least take comfort in an amazing saxophone jam.  That's the best I can tell you.  Maybe you'd prefer the brief moments of violin.  Hey, I too originally wrote these guys off as a bunch of hippies too stoned to write actual songs (and the Pierre Moerlen period as an attempt to be taken seriously) but looking back I see how much of a mistake that was!  Me and my silly assumptions.<br /><br />I can't remember \\"Mandrake\\" at the moment... perhaps I too am stoned!  Nah it's a nice song.  Nice because I can't remember it!  Alright alright.  It's a softly played xylophone/flute track that reminds me of some of Pierre Moerlen's later work with the band.  It's melodic and magnificent.  Oh and let's not overlook Didier Malherbe's saxophone work near the end which blows my mind.  How can Didier NOT be considered one of the best saxophone players of all-time?  Probably for the same reason a select few refuse to admit Frank Zappa is a genius.  Yeah you know where I'm going with this.  The title song however, \\"Shamal\\"... is extraordinary.  It's like a logical continuation of the space jazz approach from Gong's previous You album and \\"Isle of Everywhere\\" in particular and *almost* as good.  It's mostly about that saxophone jam as you'd expect, but the vocals are really catchy too.  Similar basswork to \\"Isle of Everywhere\\".  This time you have catchy vocal melodies such as the \\"Deep within you, in a secret place\\" line.  The xylophones build gradually until halfway through, then they solo I guess you could say... (wait, is an xylophone solo an actual thing like a guitar or drum solo?) and it's the best moment of the song.  Wish the violin portion was longer!<br /><br />I love how a typical Gong album feels so drugged out, and yet, there's a certain shine or glittery spark to the entire album.  What a bizarre band.  But a band that can certainly make an interesting album.  Worth owning.  Dare I say this album is perhaps better than their more popular You classic?  Hey Shamal is slightly more consistent in my opinion.  Most won't agree with me I'm sure.  Disagreeable folks make the world go round!
0307269752|5.0|I'm going to give this five stars even though it starts out slowly with too much information about finance to suit me. Also Larsson is obviously intelligent, but no author should give the impression that he is showing off for his audience--that causes a crack in the \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"  When he starts in on the Apocrapha and its acceptance or non-acceptance in Judiasm and Christianity. . . . that's really OTT.

Not familiar with the classic [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]] comic book? Then some of the plot points are not going to make much sense. But as a quick summary, it's an alternate history about the 80's Cold War (summed up nicely in the opening credits). Nixon used a super-powered being to end the Vietnam War and overturn the rules about term limits.

SilkSpectre2 is the product of a rape. Rorschach is a paranoid sociopath who lost his conscience (and as played by Jackie Earle Haley, one of the things making \\"Watchmen\\" worth watching).

0060005696|4.0|This book had a major impact on how I approach selling and marketing.  It also has affected how I look at things and my decision making in everyday life.  It is no exaggeration to say that I think about the principles in this book at least once every couple days.<br /><br />I first became aware of how paralyzing excessive choice can be when I return from living in Japan and went to shop for diapers in the supermarket.  Whereas I had to choose from a couple choices in Japan there were endless options available at the supermarket.  The amount of choices slowed down my decision making and made what should have been a simple decision a long drawn out process.<br /><br />This book points out ways to get around the problems presented by excess choice and helps you avoid the problems when presenting your own offers.  He offers some \\"decision-making shortcuts\\" that will result in less stress and anxiety.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0002VEPRQ|4.0|At one point near the beginning of \\"Mary Poppins\\", the character of Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke, looks upwards at the heavens and contemplates aloud, \\"Winds in the east, mist coming in, like somethin' is brewin' and bout to begin. Can't put me finger on what lies in store, but I fear what's to happen all happened before.\\" Yes Bert...the winds carry the stench of \\"Revolution\\". Che Poppins, affixing urban camoflauge paint to her face in a cloud not far overhead, only needs the wind to change direction before she officially brings her own brand of childcare carnage to the big screen.<br /><br />We're soon introduced to the Banks family, living in the upscale suburbs in turn of the century London, England. Dad is a capitalist and entrepreneur, battling daily doses of smog, mutinous home workers, and a wife deeply involved in an underground anti-government organization, all the while bringing home the bacon and trying to keep his home ship-shape (his neighbor takes that phrase to a whole new level). But Papa Banks also has two impressionable offspring, both intent on driving their daycare workers to the brink of madness. They too have demands, which they list clearly on a manifesto brought forth and read aloud to the governing parties of the house regarding any future nannies: \\"You must be kind, you must be witty. Very sweet and fairly pretty. Take us on outings, give us treats. Sing songs, bring sweets\\". Clearly the equal distribution of sugared confections is a high priority here.<br /><br />Enter Mary Poppins, part witch creature, part guerilla warlord, she descends upon the Banks home in a well placed para-drop and singularly blows away (literally) all the competition with efficiency that any syndicate overlord would admire. Market saturation obviously is of no consequence to her and within moments of destroying the competition she has asserted herself to Mr. Banks and appointed herself as Nanny Overlord of the Banks residence. Soon afterwards Comrade Poppins sets up shop in the children's part of the house and instructs the children on ways to better serve the State. And it starts by cleaning up one's room.<br /><br />The children are introduced to \\"everyman\\" Bert, a man who changes jobs each day in an attempt to avoid the government from learning his whereabouts. Whether Bert is belting out songs of The Worker's Struggle, selling low-end kites to the proletariat, or scrawling subversive images into the sidewalks of London, it's clear that he has an agenda, that being to destroy the moral fabric of upstanding, law-abiding families. Bert's fight against City Hall comes to a head when the next door neighbor, Admiral Boom, representing the military-industrial complex, collides with the ideologies of Bert and his comrades. Specifically Adm. Boom launches a gunpowder-laden sneak attack on Bert and his friends at a Chimney Sweep Union meeting, setting in motion the final act of The Great Peasant Uprising. Mr. Banks, now bereft of his job thanks in large part to \\"Politburo\\" Poppins' anarchist child-rearing methods, now has no income and cannot even afford to feed the birds. Nor can he spare tuppence a bag. He spends the much of the rest of the film hiding in the basement, much as Lenin's foes did. And if Banks is one of the foes, then Poppins is Trotsky reborn, shuffling out of the movie with no warning and with only an eerie promise of returning soon, perhaps in time for the next revolution. And then the concerned viewer is told to go fly a kite. How cheeky!<br /><br />The extras DVD contains interviews with the principal actors and actresses, behind the scenes looks at the actors in action, the how-to's of 1960's special effects, the stories behind the songs, and much more. There is a commentary track by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke to watch with the movie, if that's your thing. Interesting to know that the robin which Mary Poppins sings to was actually run by thick cables which had to be carefully hidden from the camera by Julie Andrews and resulted in a whole lot of shot retakes. If musicals are your thing, then Mary Poppins will be your thing.whole lot of shot retakes. If musicals are your thing, then Mary Poppins will be your thing.
B000OHZL1C|5.0|The film includes three main story lines: a naïve Angel of Death (Brad Pitt) first experiences with simple pleasures such as peanut butter, his chosen guide's attempts to keep his business based on the principles on which he founded it, while coming to terms with his own mortality, and a romance between \\"Joe Black\\" and his guide's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani). It includes a large quantity of profane language and several emotional themes.<br /><br />The movie opens with an introduction to the guide, Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who doubts that he will live for many more years. Indeed, he is approached in his home and work by what he thinks are hallucinations, wherein Death himself has come with the intention of escorting him to the afterlife.<br /><br />Bill, touched by his dream-like brush with mortality, expresses his desire for his daughter, Susan, to live a life with passion. She is considering marriage, but her father is not favorably impressed by her relationship. When she asks for the short version of his impassioned speech, he simply says, \\"Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike!\\".<br /><br />Shortly after hearing this advice, Susan meets a vibrant young man of whom she is instantly enamored. Immediately after this encounter, the man dies of collision with two cars. Death returns to Bill's home in the form of the young man, explaining that his impassioned speech has piqued his (Death's) interest after an eternity of boredom. Given Bill's \\"competence, experience, and wisdom\\", Death has chosen him and tells Bill that in return for an extended lifetime, Bill shall be his guide on Earth. Notably, during his time on Earth, Death's personality alters to become mildly curious, ruminative, and gentle, having been worldly, sardonic, and arrogant until he reveals his appearance.<br /><br />Death then places himself at Bill's right hand, under the name 'Joe Black', and establishes his place in Bill's home and work, instructing Bill to reveal his identity to nobody. This last task is complicated when the Board of Directors of Bill's corporation are urging a union with a larger company at the instigation of Susan's fianc&eacute;e, Drew (Jake Weber). After a tense Board meeting wherein Bill advises the Board against the merger, Joe ventures into the city to explore it. He visits the hospital where Susan works as a doctor to see her and in doing so, observes the human aspect of mortality, which was apparently unknown to him. A dying Guyanese patient recognizes him as a spirit; upon learning that he is Death, she asks to be taken to the afterlife. Joe instead soothes her pain and promises to take her later.<br /><br />He returns to visit Bill, who describes his late wife, to whom he was strongly attached. Their conversation is interrupted by Drew, who is bothered by the reversal of Bill's decision regarding the merger. Bill becomes angry at the prospect of the company that he built becoming less than he planned, believing that a man should leave something of integrity in his passing, whereupon Joe cautions \\"Easy, Bill; You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation\\".<br /><br />Realizing that Joe could end his delay at any time, Bill unprecedentedly arranges for dinner with his family two nights in a row, prompting them to be afraid. Bill attempts a broken and awkward speech focusing on the idea of family, after which he invites them all back for dinner again the next night. Touched by his feelings, they all agree, with one exception; that being Drew, who is angered by the presence of Joe Black, who appears to have taken the ear of Bill Parrish and disrupted Drew's plans. He is even more rankled by the increasing closeness between Susan and Joe. After a number of snide comments aimed at Joe over dinner, Drew confronts Susan about her feelings for Joe, which ends in Drew's uncertainty.<br /><br />After a flirtatious conversation with Joe, who has overheard the argument with Drew, Susan is warned by Bill not to become attached to this mysterious stranger. During the next day, Drew has gathered the board of the company, advising them that Parrish has been unconditionally influenced by \\"Mr. Joe Black\\" and telling them that the offer from the rival company will be accepted with or without Parrish as Chairman.<br /><br />After a scene wherein Parrish is reminded of the importance to himself of his family when he distresses his other daughter, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), who is trying to organize Bill's sixty-fifth birthday party, he answers the door to Drew, who starkly threatens that the Board will see him removed from the Chair. Drew then leaves, angrily announcing to Susan that this is \\"the end of my chapter with the Parrishes. And the end began with this guy\\", indicating Joe, who has also followed. After a tense and crude standoff, Drew leaves Susan and Joe alone. They are interrupted by Bill, who shows concern for his daughter.<br /><br />The following morning, Parrish is confronted by Drew and the Board of Directors, who reiterate their intentions regarding the merger. After Bill's emphatic refusal to accept both the merger and the Board's request for the identity of Joe, they vote to make Bill \\"Chairman Emeritus\\", thus depriving him of power. After the meeting, it is revealed that Drew was in collaboration with the rival company with the intention of seizing power and then selling off Parrish Communications for a huge profit.<br /><br />Bill and Joe return home, where Bill, disheartened, goes for a nap. Joe comes across Susan; after an awkward moment, they make love. Afterwards, he meets with Bill, who defies this union and reminds Joe of his purpose in the universe. Joe disregards Bill's words.<br /><br />Shortly after another encounter with Bill's daughter, Joe realizes that she is not enamored exactly of him, but rather of the man whose body he has assumed. Joe returns to Bill, who tries to entrap Drew. Joe assists by claiming that he is an IRS agent investigating Drew's dealings; a play on the saying \\"death and taxes\\". Bill is restored as chairman and the merger is canceled.<br /><br />In his speech at the lavish gala celebration, Bill Parrish fondly expresses his appreciation to his daughters for their work preparing it as well as his love for both of them. Joe later escorts Bill out of sight over a nearby bridge, presumably to his own death. Joe then sends back to life the young man whose body he borrowed, allowing Susan that chance to pursue a relationship with him. Susan tells him she wishes he could have met her father, indicating that she understands (as hinted earlier) that Joe Black was Death, and that her father is dead. The story ends as both of them are watching the fireworks celebrating her father's birthday.<br /><br />Although the film's story and characters were praised highly, many critics felt that its three hour running time was excessive, and thus reaction became mixed, with one half of the critical spectrum branding it boring, and the other half claiming that its slow pace made the story more poignant.[1] The Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films nominated it for a Saturn Award in three categories - Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Music - the film was also nominated in the Worst Remake or Sequel category at the Razzie Awards. Gary Richied of the Westchester Gazette gave the movie a 4 star rating, citing the Academy Award deserving performances by Pitt and Hopkins. It also received positive reviews from Siskel and Ebert, who gave it \\"Two Thumbs Up\\", with Ebert adding \\"there's so much that's fine in this movie\\".[2]<br /><br />While the film had a disappointing domestic box office return of $44,619,100, it fared much better overseas. Taking in an additional $98,321,000, the movie grossed a worldwide total of $142,940,100.<br /><br />A two-hour version was made to show on television and airline flights, by cutting most of the plotline involving Hopkins' character's business.

0345442970|4.0|This story was amazing. it kept me entertained all the way through.  it satisfies both action and political lovers of star wars.  The story also explains how the politics of the Star Wars universe work.  it also gives a great insight on Qui Gon's view of the force and how Chancellor Valorum ran the senate.    The only thing i wished this book included was more of the agenda of Darth Sideous, even though that is obvious. He was hardly mentioned, even though it is his plans being put into action. But overall, a really well done book.

Read up on the Bilderberg Group ~~ Trilateral Commission ~~ Council on Foreign Relations ~~ New World Order and decide for yourself.    Two key players from these groups come immediately to mind:    Alan Greenspan - former Fed Chairman whose policies significantly contributed to both the stock bubble/crash in the late 90s and the recent housing bubble/burst and accompanying global economic meltdown.  Could Sir Alan have simply been stupid, or was it intentional?    David Rockefeller - Founding member of all three organizations. JP Morgan/Chase: \\"winner\\" of Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual sweepstakes). Of all the mega banks, why would they be the chosen one? Perhaps because of Rockefeller's role in the bank?
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|We saw this movie on VHS 20 years ago & from memory - we really liked it! I bought the CD - the music is great. I've been trying to get a copy of it on DVD (or even VHS)for soooooo long & had no luck until i got onto Amazon. I wanted my guitar playing son to see it. He & my daughter both loved it too! The final \\"battle\\" is awesome - the underlying storyline & history is really interesting.

B001RPD06I|4.0|First off, let me say this product works as described, having 16GB worth of storage is great, I put my entire unprotected music library on it (Amazon MP3s and iTunes Plus AACs without DRM) so that I could use it on my Blackberry Bold cellphone and skip the iPhone. Music and video stream just fine off of it. Class 2 SDHC cards run at minimum 2MB/s and I doubt you'll run into any instances where you won't be able to play media files off it.    Make sure your cell phone device can support 16GB micro SDHC cards before buying, some can't. Most card readers should be able to handle it as it comes with an SD adapter and I had no problem writing to it with my old Sony multi-card reader I got a couple years ago.    That being said, Class 2 is slower than I'd prefer for transferring large files back and forth (for small files like documents you'll hardly notice). If they had a Class 4 16GB available I would have paid a little extra for it, but Class 2 was the only thing available. If you plan on just copying over music once in a while, this shouldn't be much of an issue. But if you are constantly moving video files, it can get annoying.    If I could go back, I'd get a Kingston 8GB Class 4 (4MB/s) micro SDHC for half the price and half the wait, at least until they release a faster 16GB card.
B000002LCI|3.0|Worthy addition as continued evidence into their 80's electro-pop innovations & domination, it nonetheless took the dawning of a new decade to seal the groups musical validity for me, here still appearing a little  too sterile, coarse, or pretentious for the most part. Aside for a song or two, the instrumentals may be the best work on here...not nearly the retro synth-salvation partial reputation suggests.
B000002KIK|4.0|\\"Never Say Die\\" is one of my favorite B.S. songs. 'Johnny Blade\\" and 'Hard Road' are excellent as well. Other highlights are 'Shock Wave' and 'Juniors Eyes'. Don't let people fool you about this album. Yes, 'Breakout' and 'Air Dance' are very weak, but the rest of the album is very listenable. If you are an Ozzy fan and a B.S. fan, you will love this album.

B000IAZOYO|2.0|I had gotten rid of this book years ago. Back then I was too jaded to read something that appeared so romantic. Yet, having read the book, maybe I made the right decision in getting rid of it. There were some enjoyable parts, and I even cried a little toward the end, but something about the writing didn't feel sincere.<br /><br />Robert Kincaid and Francesca Johnson met in 1965. He was a photographer working for National Geographic arriving in her town to photograph bridges. She had originally moved from Italy, married an American, and was now living in a place completely different and far from her home, which was Iowa.<br /><br />Francesca's husband and children were out of town, at the fair, and since she was alone, and somewhat lonely, she invited Robert into her home for dinner. A love affair unfolded that neither character expected, and they seemed to feel a love so true and pure, that after four days they were completely engrssed in one another. She had to make the decision to leave and find the adventure and fulfillment that she never got from living in Iowa, or to stay with her family in a place where she had created a life. Maybe her life in Iowa wasn't a satisfying one, but could she leave her husband and family?<br /><br />The movie and book were somewhat similiar. In most cases, it appears that books are usually better than films, but in this situation, I prefer the movie. Though it would appear that Robert James Waller is a good fiction writer, that might be a facade. He appears to be more of a poetry writer (he is a musician, after all) and there was some feeling that I got from the movie, that I couldn't get from the book. Maybe the writing feels too flowery, too fake, and I didn't connect with the characters as I did in the film. I haven't read many of the previous reviews, but from the looks of it, many gave it one star. Maybe other reviewers felt the same way that I did. I liked the idea of having a fictionalized version of a true story. I was tricked at first, like others, I thought this had really happened. But, the extra writing about interviewing someone that knew Robert Kincaid, and \\"The Beginning\\" (the first part of the story) explaining the details, like it was a true story, just didn't hold my interest.<br /><br />All and all, there were a couple of moments that touched and affected me, but there were far too many moments that made me roll my eyes instead.hers, I thought this had really happened.

Isn't it so much easier to hear of others' trials and tribulations in the pursuit of their dreams than it is for us to follow our own?  Why are we so drawn to these stories?

B000031WD9|4.0|Jim, Oz, Kevin, and Finch. Four 18 year old virgins on a quest to break the curse. After having gone through another one of Stifler's parties without getting laid, they decide to make a pact. A pact that by Prom, they will all have gotten some tail. Within those 3 weeks though, nothing goes as planned. Jim (Jason Biggs) makes a fool of himself in front of his dream girl and actually all of his school, thanks to the Internet. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nichols) can't get past the `L' word so he can round third base with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid). Oz (Chris Klein) tries to hard with cheesy lines, and we he is himself, Stifler (Sean William Scott) and his rude ways screws it up for him even then. And then there is Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), who is a little too sophisticated for his high school peers and has to lie about himself to hopefully get laid. As everything is going wrong for them, and time is nearing an end, they begin to realize that sex isn't everything.<br /><br />Man I remember when this movie came out and how much I laughed at the theaters... hard. 10 years later American Pie still holds up, but honestly it feels a lot tamer now than it did. A lot of movies now have pushed the limit even farther than American Pie did such as how American Pie pushed it farther than say Porky's or Animal House. The movie is still very funny though so don't think I'm saying it's not. The scenes between Jim and his father are still uncomfortably embarrassing laughable just like the first time. Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) is still smokingly hot also...hehe. And Stifler is still crazy and is still one of my favorite characters in the movie. I just love how non-caring he is.<br /><br />In the end I would definitely own this movie. It definitely has its crude moments, but I still feel it's a littler tamer than the comedies that are like this that are out now.<br /><br />P.S. - What did you do to yourself Tara Reid? You used to be a goddess!
B000002L9J|1.0|This crappy band, The Smiths, killed music. This album was horrible. The 80s produced some great artists like Rick Astley, Milli Vanilli (who WERE talented, back off haters&lt;3), Culture Club, etc. Then this horrible Smiths abomination comes along and makes this cringe-inducing album... and they killed music. From there on, great 80s music stopped being made. Culture Club called it a day and Rick never had another hit song. Morrissey is a jerk for destroying music. Luckily the 90s produced some great bands like Bush, System Of A Down and Limp Bizkit. Still, because of this album music will never be the same again.

0385333846|4.0|I am a 17 year old who had the option of reading Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" as part of an assignment about novels based on World War I and World War II. The one thing that attracted me about this book was that the reviews on the back cover said it was full of great sarcastic humor and tells a tale making one realize that war is not needed in the world. One thing that I saw many times in other reviews about this book was its strong anti-war message that Vonnegut states in the text. This was one of the big negatives that I did not like very much about this book. The anti-war message was unclear and did not come across well to my point of view. It seemed to me that the book talked more about events leading up to the war and the events that followed the conclusion of the war. But this was only a small con among the many pros that I had for really liking and enjoying the book. For some basic background, \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" is about a man named Billy Pilgrim who becomes a soldier in WWII to fight for the United States Army in Germany. It talks about how he becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and how Billy has very different encounters than the normal everyday person. Billy talks and experiences things with aliens called Tralfamadorians and he mentions how their beliefs are so much different than the earthlings. The book also talks greatly on the fire-bombing of Dresden and how Billy Pilgrim is a prisoner of war at the time and he talks about his survival experiences before and after the bombing. The interesting part about this book is that Kurt Vonnegut is talking about Billy Pilgrim's war experience but at times Vonnegut mentions things that have happened to him during the war because he was at the same Dresden bombing. \\"Slaughter House-Five\\" overall was a very interesting and descriptive book. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in the subject of World War II because it is such a classic novel. Vonnegut's sarcastic humor just makes all of the events that Billy Pilgrim encounters more interesting and enjoyable. The author puts an odd twist on the subject of war and violence. Lastly, Vonnegut's structure of plot is an unethical method that jumps around from subject to subject but makes reading the book different and more fun than the normal style of writing. Please read this book because you will not regret it! So it goes.that Billy Pilgrim encounters more interesting and enjoyable. The author puts an odd twist on the subject of war and violence.

B000002G87|5.0|Clapton and Duane Allman unite with Bobby Whitlock, Jim Gordon and Carl Radle for one of the most memorable releases in music history. The tone of this disk is inspired by Clapton's burgeoning love affair with Patty Boyd Harrison, the wife of his best friend, Beatle George Harrison.  \\"I Looked Away\\" is a poppy ballad that features Clapton's vocal trades with the soulful sound of Bobby Whitlock, in classic call and reply style.  \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" is a soulful love song we all know well. \\"Keep On Growing\\" changes the mood to a happier tone, and is dominated by the stunning vocal interplay between Clapton and Whitlock that is prevalent on almost every song.  Covers of classic tunes are sprinkled through out, as the Dominos tear through \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\", \\"Key To the Highway\\" and a sped up take on the Hendrix classic \\"Little Wing\\".  Duane Allman's slide guitar serves as counterpoint to Clapton's bluesy playing throughout the disk.  \\"It's Too Late\\" is another perfect example of traditional call and reply blues singing, as Whitlock responds to Clapton's sorrow laden cries of \\"She's Gone\\" in the chorus. The title song need no discussion, other than the fact that the tender piano part at the end was written by Jim Gordon, who is currently doing time for murdering his mother.  The short but tender Bobby Whitlock ballad \\"Thorn Tree in the Garden\\" is the perfect ending to a wonderful release.  Tom Dowd clicks perfectly in the studio with these top musicians to produce a memorable release that is a must have.

B0000067L2|5.0|Cream's release paid tounge in cheek reference to Benjamin Disraeli, former Prime Minister, but that is where the comparisons end.  The opening notes of \\"Strange Brew\\" indicate that this is not going to be your ordinary release.  Clapton's guitar tone is pure and cutting, and his vocals have a strange feel to them. The three musicians are at their peak, as Ginger Baker's slamming triplets and Jack Bruce's bass and harmonica cut through each track.  Clapton and Bruce are great singing together on both the blues covers and original compositions, which show their developing songwriting potential.  I am glad to see that this has finally been remastered, in that the original cd release was a poor indication of the tone and clarity of the record.  Enjoy this and play it loud.
B001QB9H10|3.0|It seems Hollywood once more attempts to milk the last drop out of an idea only to watch it go down in flames. Rather than use new ideas to make films (tying those up in development Hell), they fall back on the tried and true, using what they call a franchise instead of moving to something different. Such is the case with TRANSPORTER 3.<br /><br />Jason Statham is back as Frank Martin, the highly skilled driver who is willing to transport anything for the right price. Having retired from the business, Frank is pulled in once again when a friend crashes into his house wounded with a girl in tow. He also keeps talking about the car.<br /><br />As an ambulance takes Frank's friend from his home, the girl wakes and tells him the bracelets they were wearing are rigged to the car. As Frank tries to stop the ambulance, it explodes. Going back to question the girl, Frank is knocked unconscious.<br /><br />When he wakes, Frank finds himself in the presence of Johnson (Robert Knepper) who tells him he is not connected to his own car as well. He had tried to contract him for the job originally but failed. Now Frank has no choice but to accept his offer. A new GPS system installed in Frank's car, the girl in the passenger seat and a cell phone dialing only to Johnson start Frank out on another job.<br /><br />While it takes Frank until near films end to realize that the girl is actually the package, most viewers will do so about 30 seconds after the initial car crash into his house. We can also figure out who she is, the daughter of a politician in the Ukraine. It seems that Johnson and his group are trying to blackmail the politician into waiving regulations that would prevent them from dumping toxic waste in his country.<br /><br />Between battles with Johnson's men, with the politician's men and with the girl herself, Frank is lucky to still be around to do the impossible rescue at the end. This is one even James Bond might look at and say \\"yeah right like THAT could happen\\".<br /><br />The story is not the thing here though. All it serves as is a connecting force between Frank's fisticuffs and the high speed chase sequences. If story were important the first question one might ask is why hire Frank to transport this girl when all the bad guys seem to have no problems crossing borders to keep up with him? Why transport her at all when simply putting her in a cell would suffice?<br /><br />Statham does a great job here. Given that he has little to do except perform a well choreographed fight or two and get intense he should. But at the same time I'll give him credit for bringing a little more humanity to the character than most would have. He's come a long way since he started.<br /><br />The same can't be said for Natalya Rudakova. As Valentina, the girl in question, you would think it would be an easy task to make the character believable and one we care for. She doesn't have the ability to make her lines sound real. And if I hadn't looked it up I would have thought her Russian accent was a lousy one. Now I know that it's legit which means that even after living in New York for some time she hasn't learned the language all that well.<br /><br />Online sources state that she was found working in a salon when Luc Besson, one of the screen writers, came across her. He was supposed to have sent her for acting lessons. He should get his money back. I have the utmost respect for people attempting to act. But this is just downright terrible.<br /><br />All in all the movie delivers the goods if all you want is fast cars and rapid fire fight sequences. If you want a story to go with it, look elsewhere. It's not the worst movie I've seen in a long time but it doesn't live up to the original.though. All it serves as is a connecting force between Frank's fisticuffs and the high speed chase sequences.

B001DPC52C|5.0|I just bought this yesterday, and had to review while it was still frsh in my mind.<br /><br />I won't break down each and every song, but i will highlight what i loved(and what i didn't like).<br /><br />The Angels performance was a trip. i loved how the people on stilts came out, like Angels.<br /><br />At first, i didn't think i would enjoy it, it seemed to start out rather slow. But it just kicked in and was truly amazing.<br /><br />Deceiver of Fools and The Cross were two of my favorite performaces. I loved how they opened with Intro from Silent Force, and followed that right away with Jillian(I'd Give My Heart).<br /><br />The only parts i really didn't care for was the duet of Somewhere. the guest musicians voice just did not seem to really fit with either the song itself, nor did it blend well with Sharon's voice. They didn't seem to sync up at parts. Granted, it could just be that Somewhere is one of my favorites, and i disliked seeing anyone but Sharon sing it.<br /><br />Keith Caputo certainly sounds different live, but that could be a good thing!<br /><br />If you love within temptation, get this CD/DVD! overall i gave it 5 stars, mainly because as a whole, it's a great concert, and worth the money!
B00004XQP4|3.0|Warning by Green Day was the follow-up album to Nimrod. Warning has a lot of different sounds, very mature music but the immature lyrics are still intact (that's a good thing). Billy Joe Armstrong has such a unique voice, and his songwriting still amazes me. Warning, Waiting, Minority, and Macy's Day Parade are some of the standouts. I just wish this album was a little more consistent but still worth buying, enjoy!
B000784WMW|5.0|Looking for a great cinematic re-telling of Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece Jane Eyre?  Look no further. This 1983 performance far surpasses other versions due to its dramatic richness.  The casting is superb with Zelah Clarke as Jane and Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester. A more convincing Mr. Rochester there could never be as Timothy Dalton embodies the brooding, arrogant and yet curiously playful character with tremendous emotional sincerity.  Zelah Clarke portrays the innocent and passionate heroine Jane Eyre with a moving sense of reality that is sure to move the audience to her sympathy.  Both actors truly represent the characters as depicted in the original novel. This DVD gives you the full mini series which gives you the option to watch all together or skip to your favorite episode. Those who love the book will love this miniseries and those who've never read the book will, after viewing this series, soon after claim it as a favorite.
B00138KJY0|5.0|This is def. my favorite album from Michael jackson. Off the Wall is cool. Don't stop till you get enough is one of my favorite Mj songs! Rock with you is an excellent dance track. Burn this disco out is interesting. I think this a great example of disco funk, and it was made during that time. So anybody who's a fan of funk/ r & b is def.gonna love this cd. This def. one of the best albums made of all time. His video and image for this album is really simple by today's standards, but is great in some ways because it doesn't outdate itself. The videos are pretty cool as well. Go out and buy it! This CD is awesome.
0345472322|4.0|In example after example, Dweck helps us to see to what extent what she calls the \\"fixed mindset\\" can get in the way of learning and growth.<br /><br />As a coach and therapist, I've seen many examples of this, such as a student who didn't bother studying, to the consternation of his mother, because he believed he \\"wasn't smart enough, so there was no point.\\" The mother just thought he was lazy.<br /><br />One of the key concepts is that we can teach people (and the earlier, the better, note to parents and teachers) that the brain is like a muscle and will continue to grow and improve with effort. Putting in effort doesn't have to mean we aren't smart or talented.<br /><br />Dweck's work is now being piloted in some schools and seems to be quite effective in that setting. Her concepts are equally important for adults. Of her many examples, one that stands out for me is that of John McEnroe. The idea of McEnroe as the owner of a fixed mindset and someone who couldn't fail out of fear of being untalented compared to other athletes such as Michael Jordan, who touted how many times he had failed in a commercial continues to resonate.
B000V658EQ|5.0|My dad bought this album, and I thought anything my dad listens to can't be that good. But Listened to it when i was alittle older and realized how  amazing it is. It really stands the test of time, and is really one of the best r and b/ and or pop music albums ever made. I mean mercy mercy gives me chills. What's goin on is classic. Wholy wholy is an interesting tune. Marvin Gaye really hit his creative peak at this point. I think the only other R and B album that came out during this time that can compare is Al Green's Let's Stay Together. I'm still glad he's at least around to make music. HOw can anybody not like this album or not think that it has any depth. I think any fan of music in general will love this album. Most of the music is slow,but really works for his voice and is indeed very poetic. You should go and buy the album,its worth it!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|Ok,so I reviewed this album a while back, and decided on reviewing this album again. After hearing about the recent death of Michael Jackson. After he died, I decided to listen to all of his albums, and I found this album to be excellent, but not my favorite from him. Most of the songs are way too over played, and there's two or three other albums that I could suggest that sound just as good as this one!(ex. buy donna summer's self titled 82 cd, or Aretha's Jump to it album, did i forget to mention Prince and Teena Marie?) I think the real credit goes to Quincy Jones, he was a master a producing this album. I do like Beat it, P.Y.T., Billie Jean, and Human Nature(although i do prefer the SWV version). I think most of the songs could be seen as good for its time, but I do think that he's came out with better stuff then this. Some of his older albums are good, and I like Bad, Dangerous, Blood on the Dance floor alittle better. Billie Jean is my favorite Michael Jackson song. I heard this song my freshman year in HS, and thought it was dark, chilling, yet stood the test of time because it still sounds decent even by today's standards. I think the last few tracks are the ones that I would almost consider hidden, but it def. shows how much of an R&B album this still was. I think this album is enjoyable, but def. not the best pop album of all time.
0321525949|4.0|This book is a classic and remains a very valuable conceptual guide.  While the text seems to be up-to-date, the accompanying code suffers from the age of the environment in which is was originally written and has not been ported to Linux.  I write this review from the Linux point of view as I am not programming in the Sun or BSD environment.    I purchased the book with the idea of learning pty programming for Fedora.  While the chapter was very informative in its discussions, using the man pages is required.  As the source code accompanying the book doesn't address Linux, per se, and one may be tempted to use the apue.linux3.tar.Z download with its Red Hat port of the common library.  Downloading it may be helpful, but the added code was written for Red Hat 6 and the book is newer than that.  Specifically, the pty open code was not functional and I reverted to the svr4 code which still needed tweaking.    Some of the original sample code is architecturally out of step with the current way of doing things.  For example, originally ptys were found by canonically generating all pty names until one could be successfully opened.  The sample code is written to return the successfully generated name.  The current method in Linux (and elsewhere, I suppose) is to open(\\"/dev/ptmx\\") and then call ptsname().  So plan on using this to study and then writing your own more modern code or tweak the sample code as needed.  Of course, one of the goals of the code is to create a portable library to support various *nix flavors, so this criticism may be overstated.    Still, it seems a thorough modernization of the sample code would have made this book more valuable.  But as I said, I am not programming in the Sun or BSD environment.
B000TDG9D0|4.0|Tina Turner is a classic. Let's not play, alot of people know her music and her image. Her story of what's love got to do with it is pretty good, and is really sad. As for some of the tracks some a excellent while others suck. 1984, way way too outdated. I mean it really is,it's almost kind of boring if you ask me. What's love got to do with it is a classic. it's got a great message and a cool image even by today's standards. I love Private Dancer favorite solo tina song. She really gives you chills about the horrors of prostuiton and the video is even more powerful. She's truly a classic and while i wouldn't put her as the queen(there are certnaily others). Tina doesn't disappoint.
0676978010|5.0|Klein's given the world a rare gift in \\"The Shock Doctrine.\\" Well researched, finely crafted, easy to read and understand, yet deep and penetrative in its analysis, this book is a must-read for anyone looking to understand how, exactly, it all went wrong.

1401307450|4.0|This is an excellent story about Kiedis' rise and fall into the depths of addiction and recovery, tracking his history with the Chili Peppers.

B000KC86F4|3.0|Now I am a fan of the X-Men movies.  And this is a review of the BLU-RAY technology of this film and not so much the story line of the film itself.  I actually own them on standard DVD, so I recently saw XMen-The Last Stand on blu-ray on an 1080p TV and I can tell you that blu-ray in 1080p will enhance tiny flaws and make them obvious.  I notice this with other movies of this type (F4RSS - Fantasic Four Rise...) and the digital effects are so noticeable that they look fake.  In the XMen, when Magneto moves the golden gate bridge it didn't look convincing.  The actors look like actors on a stage and the bridge look fake, the cars sliding on the bridge looks as if they were being pulled by wires and I think I know why.  Because the scene looks so clean that it didn't look like it was actually taking place outside, but rather inside of a computer.  Now don't get me wrong, I love blu-ray and it works great for some films, but in this movie, things look so disconnected.  Now on the otherhand when I reduced the resolution to 1080i, it looked remarkably more real.  But at 1080p on a 50\\" plasma, 47\\" LCD and a 65\\" plasma, it looks like XMEN the Play instead of Xmen the movie.  Xmen series is a good series and I would still recommend you buy it on blu-ray if you enjoy the series, its just that I wanted to talk about the higher resolution issue that, for me at least, seem to crop up with movies that has a lot of CGI shots.
1595141715|5.0|Let me just say Wow!  Lately I've only read a few books that totally blew me away and this is definitely one of them.  I didn't want to stop reading this one.<br /><br />Originally the idea sounded really depressing, reading why a young girl decides to end her life.  But as you read about all the small events that took place that eventually snow balled up to a point where Hannah felt she could no longer go on, you realize that what may be an inconsequential action to give can mean a lot to someone else.  I can only imagine what the rest of the recipients of these tapes must have been thinking as they listened to Hannah's story but I hope they learned something from them as well.  If you have not read this one yet I highly recommend you go out and get yourself a copy.

B000002UAX|5.0|At least it seems that way to me, but it always feels that way when I am listening to this band. Just when you think that the Beatles couldn't top their last album, the White album was created. This album continued to prove that the Beatles were nowhere close to running out of original ideas and great sounds. This album was way ahead of its time because a lot of the songs on this album could be modern chart hits. I couldn't believe how modern these songs still feel and relate to me and you can only imagine how great it is to discover such an album that only approves with age. Some of the songs on this album are a little strange if you don't understand the background on the creation of some of these songs, but it is still works of art that can't be denied. I always think I have a favorite Beatles album, and a later release knocks the previous out of the top spot. I think it is the same with this record. The White Album is definitely a master piece.

B001NFNFNU|2.0|Jolie seemed to sleepwalk through her part, a real downer that almost ruined the movie about a relentless mother in a desperate and heart-wrenching search for her missing son.  Perhaps she was miscast or just can't act.  The story was decent if slow in parts and without much conflict or surprise.  Dark and foreboding light had been falling asleep at times.  Good try, Clint, but this one didn't quite work.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|As a lifelong fan of Oistrakh who has wandered the hall of many CD stores looking in vain for CD versions of his recording, I jumped at this and the Historial Russian Archives collection and am thrilled to have two such wonderful collections in my possession.  The recordings are fabulous, the sound is fabulous, Oistrakh is magnificent.  The only quibble I have is that whoever coded these pieces for the computer was very tired, very drunk, completely ignorant of the English language, or all of the above. The title of the series was mispelled.  Entire CDs were completely mislabelled.  For example, Beethoven's violin concerto in D was labelled Brahms Violin Concerto in D. A Sibellius violin concerto was labelled as a Dvorak violin concerto.  A CD labelled \\"Mozart flute concertos\\" by the London Symphony orchestra was eventually revealed to be two MOzart Violin concertos and the Sinfonia concertante, played by David Oistrakh (with Igor Oistrakh helping out on the Synfonia) with the Berliner PHilharmoniker . . . about half the CDs in both collections were similarly mislabelled.      I spent a fair bit of time listening to CDs and correcting the data entry so that I have the correct labels in my own computer and MP3 player.      So if you buy either or both of these collections and intend to store them on your computer and MP3 player, BEWARE!  Unless you are so familiar with all the pieces that it doesn't matter because you know what you're listening to and who is playing, or unless you really don't care if you know what or who you're listening to, you're going to have to go through the same process of re-cataloguing.     Anyone who isn't mobile with their music won't be affected, but so many people are these days.  And like it or not, these things do get shared and swapped, meaning that an unknown number of people are going to go through life believing that Brahms wrote the Beethoven Violin Concerto in D and so forth. One might say it serves them right for ripping off therecord companies, however it also seems highly disrespectful of the artists and composers who are thereby not being admired for who they really are.  It's disappointing that more care wasn't taken with these details.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|It is no wonder that after 25 years, \\"Scarface\\" is still ranked among the best of all gangster movies. Why?  Apart from great acting and cinematography, \\"Scarface\\" spoke to the philosophy and \\"rugged individualism\\" of many Americans. The drug culture during the 1970's and 1980's was huge and the underclass in society ate up the likes of Tony Montana. Just as a similar demographic devoured and emulated the character \\"Priest\\" in the movie \\"Superfly.\\" Movies in this genre' will always be popular, because of its maverick, anti-establishment and \\"Die or Get Rich Trying\\" themes.      In contemporary times, the drug culture doesn't have the cachet it once had.  The sports and entertainment industry have trumped the need for \\"wanna be\\" gangsters to risk life and limb to hustle street pharmaceuticals.  Now, they hustle \\"beats\\" and \\"rhymes.\\"     \\"Scarface\\" survives, despite its by-gone drug culture, because its business tenets apply to any industry.

B000000WJZ|4.0|...I had some university friends who lived in what used to be a brothel, which made for some interesting late night knocks on the door. Anyway, we were all sitting around one day killing time when Marty put this on. We looked up to Marty. He picked up girls, was doing a uni degree that would actually get him a job, money and (presumably) girls and had done a year in the army - which seemed to get him girls. So if Marty wanted to put some new disc on by a band that we'd never heard of then we weren't going to argue.<br /><br />And it made such an impression on me that many years later when I started to flesh out my collection I revisited this album and it's not a bad spin by any means. Looking at the band photos now they appear laughably young and main man Billy Corgan looks positively cherubic. Which makes the maturity and sorrow within so many of these guitar fuzz driven alterna rockers even more impressive and worthy of your respect. The album throws mixed signals at the listener, much like Helmets' Betty the cover art is deceptive and you're not really sure what you'll be getting. But once inside this is alterna grunge but a more human version than what you'd get from Cobain. Whereas Kurt seems to have wanted to explore the distress and pain and get violently angry as a response, ye olde pumpkins seem to be commiserating with the listener. Perhaps that's the difference in alterna rock delivered by someone from the wrong side of the tracks and Corgans more university rock creation.<br /><br />Of course it's easy to criticise this release too - I mean of the thirteen songs here ten have single word titles, proving that those who supposedly stood outside convention did so as a conglomerate block. Also the fuzz of the guitar work can be viewed as either deliberate and artistically relevant or just done to disguise sloppiness. And yes bombarding the audience with depression as opposed to hair metals upbeat anthems may not seem like a watershed of distaste, merely petulance against whatever there was to react against.<br /><br />Not to mention a bunch of people who look 19 years old whining incessantly in that sort of 90's les miserables way does grate a bit just like the negativity of, say, Nevermores' This Godless Endeavour did.<br /><br />Yet in summary the hard rock fuzz (that word just keeps on surfacing) is good for background clatter, something to listen to while your at work, safe in the knowledge that what your listening to is artistically and musically defensible in it's exploration of youthful doubt and hurt. It's not something that graces my stereo often - especially Disarm wihch is just too traumatic - but this is a very solid work of 90's alterna rock that has enough heft to satisfy and enough delicate moments to prove these guys and a girl had a brain.<br /><br />So all up I give this a low flying four stars because for all it's good points it has a few downsides that see it miss out on the full five stars even if it shows a highly influential band in bloom....atever there was to react against.

B001P3SA94|4.0|Cadillac Records is not a documentary; it's a movie. And like any good movie, it gives the viewer a sense of time, place and character while telling a compelling story. This movie does so brilliantly. The acting is impressive - and why not? Jeffrey Wright and Adrien Brody are respected actors. Beyonce steps outside her comfort zone and gives a performance one would only expect from an experienced actor. The music is performed with love and respect. The sets, wardrobe, cars - everything gives you a real sense of the southside of Chicago in the 1950s, and of the people who not only sang but lived the blues. Don't quibble over details; go read a book on the history of Chess Records if that's what you're looking for. But if you are looking for a compelling story with a strong script that is well acted and directed, and so much more deserving of the little attention it received when it was in release, then you must see this film. If you love the blues, YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse wrote funny stories. Obscenely hilarious comedy stories about dim young aristocrats, overbearing aunts and very clever servants.<br /><br />And of all his creations, the most memorable is the ill-fated and blue-blooded Bertie Wooster and his megabrained valet Jeeves, immortalized by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. \\"The Complete Jeeves & Wooster\\" brings together all their madcap, bizarre little adventures in England's upper echelongs, with many a disastrous engagement and stint in prison.<br /><br />Bertie Wooster (Laurie) is in need of a valet, and after a wild night out, the low-key, brainy manservant Jeeves (Fry) is sent by an agency to deal with Bertie's everyday needs.<br /><br />But Jeeves doesn't just fold Bertie's hankies and give him hangover tonics -- he keeps Bertie out of all kinds of trouble. Predatory young beauties, ditzy idiot pals of Bertie's, and domineering aunts trying to marry him off, Bertie is always in hot water -- and Jeeves always is on hand, with a plot cooking in his impressive brain, to haul his hapless employer out.<br /><br />Among the many problems they have to tackle: a stolen cow creamer, a little book of insults directed at an amateur Hitler, a starvation tactic that ends in disaster, American millionaires, a flirtation with fatherhood, scandalous memoirs, Bingo Little's countless infatuations, the havoc wreaked by mustaches, pearl necklaces going missing, and many compromising situations that begin -- or end -- unwanted engagements.<br /><br />\\"The Complete Jeeves and Wooster\\" is quite faithful to Wodehouse's original stories -- some stories are combined and others are separated, but they draw heavily on his kooky, bizarro prose. Not to mention a sort of alternate between-wars England full of glamour and a merry-go-round of oft-broken engagements, with Jeeves as the calm in the storm's eye.<br /><br />The only problem is that the stories set in New York just don't have that delicious British flavour that the rest of the series does, although they're still quite funny. That, and the cast changes continuously.<br /><br />But those small flaws don't keep the series from being hilarious, from start to finish. Every episode is a hopeless tangle of infatuations, overbearing aunts, mixups, blackmail, newts, meddling aunts and young women ranging from devious to airy-fairy -- often all of the above. And yet somehow Jeeves manages to untangle it by the end. And Wodehouse's dialogue is handled in a brilliant manner (\\"Because he is a butterfly, who toys with women's hearts and throws them away like soiled gloves!\\" \\"Do butterflies do that?\\").<br /><br />Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast as the endearing bumbler Bertie Woosterand the dryly witty Jeeves. Though Bertie's lack of clothing sense (and a trombone) often annoys Jeeves, the brainy valet clearly does have affection for Bertie, and Bertie appreciates Jeeves' ability to save him from fates worse than death (such as marriage to the horribly hearty Honoria or the wispy, fairy-loving dimbulb Madeleine).<br /><br />\\"The Complete Jeeves and Wooster\\" is a simply brilliant stretch of what-ho-what-ho comedy (\\"You can't be a successful dictator AND design women's underclothing\\") and deliciously twisting storylines. Not to be missed. Ever.funny. That, and the cast changes continuously.     But those small flaws don't keep the series from being hilarious, from start to finish. Every episode is a hopeless tangle of infatuations, overbearing aunts, mixups, blackmail, newts, meddling aunts and young women ranging from devious to airy-fairy -- often all of the above. And yet somehow Jeeves manages to untangle it by the end. And Wodehouse's dialogue is handled in a brilliant manner (\\"Because he is a butterfly, who toys with women's hearts and throws them away like soiled gloves!\\" \\"Do butterflies do that?\\").     Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfectly cast as the endearing bumbler Bertie Woosterand the dryly witty Jeeves.

0340733748|4.0|Following in the tradition of Graham Greene, who wrote spy novels contemporaneous with his own, John LeCarre uses his experience in the foreign service and MI6 to add realism to his tales of espionage. Green, however, remained a friend of traitor Kim Philby and continued to send his novels to Philby after Philby defected to Russia. LeCarre was betrayed by Philby to Russian agents, and his career was ended. This betrayal gives added realism to his novels, which show real disillusionment with the system and, sometimes, with its agents and officials.<br /><br />Written in 1974, this novel draws on the real life of \\"LeCarre\\" (real name David Cornwell) and many of his associates who were unmasked by Philby and the \\"Cambridge Five.\\" Here LeCarre creates a vivid and morally probing story in which his hero, George Smiley, is called out of his enforced retirement to unmask a Soviet \\"mole\\" high in the British secret service, referred to as \\"the circus.\\" Five men (as in the real betrayal) have been suspected of aiding the Soviets. Drawing on his friendships with some of the agents who were dismissed when he was, Smiley investigates the security leaks which have led to humiliation for British intelligence and real danger for some of its agents. As he tries to identify the mole, he receives peripheral help from Sir Oliver Lacon of the British Foreign Office.<br /><br />Written in formal and polished prose, the novel is full of Cold War complexities. Karla, the legendary head of Soviet intelligence, continues to control a small group of Soviet \\"defectors\\" and \\"disillusioned\\" Communists, whom the British mistakenly regard as double agents providing them with secret information. At the same time, British Control (who is never identified by name) is trying to uncover the Soviet mole (nicknamed \\"Gerald\\") within their own agency. Jim Prideaux, who appears in several Smiley novels, is working on this operation in Czechoslovakia when he is betrayed and almost killed, his entire operation shut down, and many of his agents executed by the Russians.<br /><br />Smiley's investigations are decidedly prosaic, not the exciting shoot-'em-ups of James Bond novels. Slogging through mountains of paperwork, interviewing reluctant former agents, and doing his own legwork, Smiley works at unmasking Gerald the hard way. The complexity of his character (and of the other characters here) make up for the relative lack of dramatic action and highlight LeCarre's skill at creating intriguing characters who see the \\"grays\\" in an otherwise black-and-white world. His dialogue is quick-paced, often witty, and revelatory of subtle character traits, adding to the depth of the portraits and to the intricacies of the world of spy/counterspy.

0375842209|2.0|Seriously, this book is so long that as an adult I could barely get myself together to slog through it.  Now I can see that a large number of people really liked this book, and I had hoped for the same results, but for me it didn't work.    I felt the need to write a review (as have some others) so that the 5 stars don't totally overwhelm.      The end of the book is better than the beginning and middle, if you can get that far.    I wish you luck.  MR
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|The Doctor really hits its stride with this latest installment.  At the beginning I was wonder how could they do it?  How do you top the destruction of the entire world in a new season?  It is done quite convincingly I might add.  There are strong episodes and a few weak ones.      \\"Partners in Crime\\" reintroduces us to the character of Dona Noble who we last saw in Runaway Bride.  Dona may be something of a strong willed bitch but the actress does a good job of asserting herself and creating her own character.      The Fires of Pompeii-A very good standalone episode it should appeal to the historian in anyone.  I say that as far as standalone episodes go this is one of the best.      Planet of the Ood-reintroduces a species we last saw in a season 2 episode \\"The Satan Pit\\" the aliens are fleshed out and you actually find yourself feeling very sympathetic towards them.      The first of the story arch episodes \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\"  \\"The Poison Sky\\" are alright any problem I might have with the episodes themselves is resolved by the ultimate resolution I am a sucker for self sacrifice.      The Doctor's Daughter is a good standalone episode the futility of war and all of that is always a rich storyline especially these days.      Midnight is also a very good episode kind of a Murder on the Orient Express with the Doctor.  It works    Turn Left is one of my favorite episodes an entire alternate universe is created and it all takes 50 minutes.  Truly awesome.      The Stolen Earth and Journey's End manages to tie together several plot lines from all the new seasons and the Darleks make an appearance again always a good thing.  All of the spin-offs also make an appearance and they do a much better job here then they do on there own without the Doctor.  Even though Donna in the end has to leave the doctor she goes out with a bang.        Overall-They pulled it off they reinvented themselves after the third season good for them.  Also as far as minor characters go Donna's Grandfather has to be one of my favorite so far.

0740748475|5.0|I am very happy with the whole collection of Calvin and Hobbes. BUT, after reading some of the reviews before I purchased it I have to agree that the only thing I do not like is the way it is bound. A collection of such great humor should have been better treated and bound with better quality materials. I am a little afraid to read them because I am also worried about the pages coming unglued. For that reason I am seriously considering having it rebound so it can be properly displayed and enjoyed. I am still very happy that I bought it and would do it again even with these faults.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|\\"Taken\\" defies the viewer's credulity as Liam Neeson dispatches scores of the Albanian Mafia in the quest for his kidnapped daughter. He's a tech-savvy, hand-to-hand fighting expert trained in security work by the U.S. government. It's a violent movie with some vicious, gory moments. If some U.S. security experts operate the way this guy does, we are in deep trouble.<br /> The movie is well-made, well-acted, and it grabbed me because I'm a sucker for clever detection and suspenseful plots. The motivation behind this kidnapping plot is far-fetched, but don't let that stop you. The car chase scenes are well-executed even if they are incredible. The movie's beginning will get your attention. Early on there's an exciting scene with Liam saving a pop singer from harm as a part-time security man.<br /> At times Neeson seems to have super-human powers, a super-hero impervious to bullets. Why are the bad guys after firing off fusillades of firepower unable to hit their target? Bad aim? Neeson's car is riddled with countless bullet holes, yet he emerges unscathed. He's Superman without the tights.<br /> I think you'll get carried along even though it's hectic, bloody and kind of goofy. The Paris background is absorbing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor who draws you into the plot.
0307386171|5.0|Not because it has a happy ending, that's for sure.<br />In fact, if you're a reader who likes happy endings, this is probably not the choice for a day on the beach. But I don't need to tell you that. All you have to do is read the first sentence. \\"Tears before supper\\" -- that's what my mother would say. Right from the beginning the author makes it very clear that this is a story that ends badly. As indeed it does.<br />So why did I love this book? Why couldn't I put it down? Why did I uncharacteristically stay up all night reading it? (The last time I stayed up all night was my Senior Prom, back when dinosaurs were still roaming the earth)<br />I loved it because it was absolutely, fantastically beautifully crafted and written. And I loved it because it was true.<br />This sort of thing happens. A split second changes your life. A response. A non-response. Sometimes, you can go back. But mostly you can't. And the awful thing is, you don't know the moment is decisive until after it's passed.<br />This is the story of one of those moments. And it is as gripping a story as any I've ever read.

1580493939|4.0|I have seen the old movie several times, and it tempted me to order the book.  Oscar Wilde was a \\"wild child\\", and he gives a glimpse into the often vain and decadant world of English society through the wanton excesses of Dorian...who appears to remain beautiful, youthful, and untouched by evil.  It is Dorian's portrait that decays with every misdeed, including murder.  The picture haunts Dorian as he travels among the rich, and also into the opium dens and low life of the waterfront. This edition contains a glossary of lesser known terms and references, for us modern folk.  It was a quick and fascinating read.

B001G0MFOM|1.0|\\"The L Word\\" has been my guilty pleasure television show for a numbers of years now.  I honestly have no idea what originally  brought me to the series, nor can I think of any particular moment when it became appointment television, but eventually its hooks got sunk into me and I was lost.  I thought it was a beautifully written, shot and acted series with plenty of drama (but never overtly over the time) and a very very talented cast.    Despite this, I was shocked with how downright awful the final season of the series is.  The final season (which the writers were given an entire year to write and shot), is composed of an 8-episode mystery of *SPOILER* Who Killed Jenny, with the first act of the season establishing the arc and the remained of the season played in flashbacks leading up to the big moment.  Yet, the writers never say  who killed her, leaving the story wide open.  That's right, a 6 year series with a definite finale ended on a cliff-hanger, in a very anticlimatic episode, and honestly painful to watch episode.    Beyond that this season every character did something or revealed something ridiculously out of character that just kept changing the entire dynamic of the series, and not in a good way.  After watching this on showtime, I'm pretending the series ended with season 5.
0307269191|3.0|As a runner, I was looking forward to reading a well-known novelist's thoughts on the sport. His prose is pleasant enough, and his recitation of experiences is good-natured and occasionally philosophical. However, I just never found it enthralling, or even more than mildly interesting. When I reached the end, I thought, \\"That was it?\\" Not a bad way to spend some idle time, but not terribly incisive or inspiring or lyrical either. (Maybe it reads better in Japanese.)

I highly recommend this cd to young and old alike.  The group's versitility and song selection is a real joy to hear.  Every song has a different and unique sound, which is not the norm with most groups today.  Good luck and success to Alter Bridge!    -VT  Ball Ground, GA
B00005JPY2|5.0|'The Dark Knight' is a fantastic movie.    But if I had to go by how much a movie has affected me? 'Watchmen' wins hands down, for consider: never before has it occurred to me to go to the cinema twice to see the same movie. After seeing it on the Friday of its release, I needed to go back again that Sunday.    When I Read Clive Barker's 'Galilee' some years back I was stunned and amazed... and strangely gutted: I would never have the joy of reading that book again for the first time.    That's how I felt about 'Watchmen' when I first saw it.    It is not like any other superhero movie. Not like any other movie, period. I was amazed they got away with it. How did they get away with it?! For 20 years they tried to bring the original graphic novel source material to the big screen. After so many false starts (remember when Arnie - the now Governor of California - was going to be Dr. Manhattan?!) all anyone had a right to expect was a movie that had nothing much to do with the comic at all. That's why I'm stunned: It's so faithful I cannot help thinking, \\"How did they get away with it?\\"    Even if you don't like the movie, you will still think to yourself, \\"Well I definitely ain't never seen a movie like that before...\\"    For me 'Watchmen' is more layered than 'The Dark Knight', thus making repeated viewings so enriching.    Sure, 'The Dark Knight' is layered also, but its intentions are transparent, meaning you 'get it' the first time you see it. Its moody cinematography clearly marks it as a serious 'mature' movie.    'Watchmen' is far more subversive:    Here you have a movie which is bright and colourful and - gosh! - doesn't it look fun?! So why does it make some people uncomfortable? Because, on the surface, the movie taunts its audience by appearing to be yet another 'X-Men'.    The visual style of the movie may feel like a comic book, but the brutality of its violence honours the irony of The Comedian character's name: this is all a bad joke - me, you, this world's politicians, this petty thug whose face I'm smashing in, and yet ain't a one of us getting punished by the law for beating someone up cos we're wearing stupid costumes and that makes it all right.    Whereas every other Superhero Movie - including 'The Dark Knight' - celebrates the genre, 'Watchmen' gleefully deconstructs it. And it doesn't need shadow and smoke and dim lighting in order to do so.    On the surface everything is there for yet another formulaic Superhero Movie. After all, it looks the part...    ... but this is where the genius of Watchmen's subversion comes in, for although the movie can be enjoyed on purely a visual visceral level, woven through its stock superhero tropes you have tales of rape, cancer and impotency -    - you even have one of the 'Good Guys' assassinating John F. Kennedy in the opening credits.    Compared to that 'The Dark Knight' seems positively pedestrian.    Even the movie's flaws (with the exception of President Nixon's large prosthetic nose) unintentionally work in its favour by holding up a spotlight to its own absurdity of grown men and women dressing up in Hallowe'en costumes.    One purpose of the movie's frequent slow-motion motif that I immediately noticed is that is gives the character Rorschach and Dr Manhattan's voice-overs room to breathe, whilst at the same time lending the movie its comic book look; and yet deliberately confounds your expectations by not being a comic superhero movie.    It's as if The Comedian (a thinly disguised 'Captain America') directed this movie -    A female protestor gets punched in the face without hesitation... by one of the 'Good Guys'. A pregnant woman gets shot at point-blank range... by one of the 'Good Guys'.    It you were to take The Dark Knight's premise of a 'gritty' superhero-movie-for-adults to its logical next level then 'Watchmen' would be the result. Be careful what you ask for because you just got it.    And you thought 'The Phantom Menace' 'raped your childhood'.You'll never look at 'Iron Man' and 'Spider-Man' the same way again.    The Nite Owl character (a thinly disguised 'Batman') is so hung up he becomes impotent the first time he's with Silk Spectre (a thinly disguised 'Wonder Woman'). And yet later - after cracking some heads - ? No problem. That's what makes the 'love scene' in the Nite Owl's airship so hilarious and appropriate: these people get off on beating up some poor schmucks in order that they can become 'whole' and connect. Even this is made blatant by the way the characters grin and mug at each other after fighting the Bad Guys: they're turned on by the violence they're dishing out and they're not ashamed to admit it. The song choice for that love scene?! \\"Hallelujah\\" right enough!! LOL!!! That's some serious screwed up Freudian stuff right there...    The Comedian is definitely behind the lens of this movie, chomping on his cigar.    Critics point to the lack of experience in the unknown actress who plays Silk Spectre. Yet, unintentionally, that works in the character's favour: she has an out-of-her-depth naivety, only 'coming alive' when fighting the 'Bad Guys'. Dr Manhattan (a thinly disguised 'Superman') shows the viewer logically what would happen if someone really was superhuman: a guy so powerful that his intelligence has caused him to lose his ability to relate to his fellow man.    \\"God help us all,\\" right enough as The Comedian says upon noticing this.    And the coup de grace of unintentional flaws which work in the movie's favour? The Osymandias superhero character who ultimately 'saves the world' is flat, bland and totally uninteresting.    Just like they say: bad guys are so much more interesting to play. And this movie makes its 'Good Guys' so flawed that you can't tell them from the 'Bad Guys'.    As to the graphic violence -    As much as I love horror fiction I detest horror movies: they're nothing more than torture-porn.    At the same time, however, I believe the director Jack Snyder is deliberately shaming the audience into guilt because of its lust for violence. Watchmen's violence is not meant to be realistic - the slo-mo effect makes sure of that, whilst simultaneously glorying in it because, hey, that's what you want, right? The Good Guys and The Bad Guys duelling it out? Sure you do, that's what Superhero Movies are all about. You like to hear the crack of bones breaking? Okay. We'll show you it too. We'll show you it in such a way that you feel it, with slo-mo effect to rub your nose in it. After all, that's what you want.    But why do this?    A one point The Comedian character gets punched repeatedly in the face by a fellow 'Good Guy' superhero, until he falls to his knees.    With burst lip and bloody nose The Comedian looks up, grins, and says, \\"This is what you like, huh? This is what gets you hot?\\"    The movie is taunting its audience, The Comedian looking into camera and speaking directly to them: you like punch-ups in Superhero Movies, don'tcha? So, we're giving it to ya, whatcha complaining about?    The violence is more graphic than it needs to be in order to make its audience uncomfortable, and thereby shame it.    Remember, 'Watchmen' is an anti-Superhero Movie.    'Watchmen' doesn't 'update' the Superhero Movie so much as crush it beneath its heel.    Welcome to the world of post-'Dark Knight'.

B0012OQZWA|2.0|It has really been shameful, in the most part, for metal over the last few years. Trying to impress by killer guitar riffs and drum solos.

4883191028|1.0|Minna no Nihongo would be a great book, except the print is insanely small. The furigana is so tiny, I can't read the characters, even using a magnifying glass.<br /><br />I've had to stoop to scanning relevant pages, and viewing them as jpg files, which is utterly inconvenient. It's so inconvenient, that I simply stopped using the book, which kinda bites, as it's needed for my Japanese class.<br /><br />I've never been so angry at a book.  Huge swaths of blank spaces, occasionally marked with microscopic print.<br /><br />If you've mastered kanji, it's no problem. But, if like most students of Japanese, you need some furigana, forget it!  It's unreadable.<br /><br />I don't understand why a beginner's book in Japanese would start with kanji, but this one does. It's kanji from page 1, 'till the very end. And that makes furigana a must, for those of us that haven't mastered a few thousand kanji. Therefore, this book is worthless...unless you are already fluent in Nihongo, in which case you wouldn't need this book anyway.<br /><br />This book utterly sucks, and it's because of the tiny, tiny, tiny furigana.
0307269981|5.0|I found a copy of \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" when I was visiting New Zealand a couple of weeks ago. I loved it just as much as \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" It was the perfect book for my LONG trip back, and I finished just as the plane was landing at DIA. Perfect timing. I gave the book to a friend who loved \\"Dragon Tattoo,\\" and she called to complain that now she can't get anything done because she can't put the book down.
B001CTDH4Y|1.0|This movie is neither \\"hilarious\\" nor \\"fun filled\\". Much of it is very disturbing, with violence towards animals both portrayed and implied including dogfighting. The only jokes there are rely on some pretty offensive stereotypes and Piper Perabo's peculiar appearance is very off-putting.     And don't even get me started on the endless self-aggrandizing ads that precede the film.     You'd be much better off with Lady & the Tramp or the Ugly Dachshund. Avoid this like the plague.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|I love this movie.  Chaotic, loud, colorful, frenzied and so many other adjectives, the Dickensian \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" was one of my top choices of 2008.  I was so thrilled by the film after I first saw it that I brought a friend along with me the second time because I was afraid the movie would come and go too quickly for him to get another chance to see it.  The big surprise was when it started sweeping awards shows and emerged as the front runner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />But much like Jamal Malik, the hero of this film, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" came out of (almost) nowhere and rose to the top during the 2008 awards season.  I say \\"almost\\" because director Danny Boyle was already known for such films as \\"Shallow Grave,\\" \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"28 Days Later.\\"  But \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" made him even better known.  Heck, nearly every single member of my family saw this movie, and that never happens.  One of the real treats of this film is the performance by the youngest children who are excellent as children put into a precarious position in their lives.<br /><br />Some of the scenes of abuse and the rough life of the slums can be hard to watch for some, so let those be forewarned.  How accurately does this film depict reality for people in cities like Mumbai?  I can't really say.  There is criticism that this movie is unfair in its look at the brutal trials these children undergo, that it only shows the absolute worst but come on, how many films have ever been a perfect mirror?  \\"Slumdog\\" did not purport to be reality any more than \\"Sex and the City\\" tried to be a documentary of life in New York City.  (And thank God.)  I love this movie.  Ably assisted from the charismatic Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto as well as more established actors such as Anil Kapoor and Irfan Khan (who was wonderful in 2006's \\"The Namesake\\"), this tale is one for the ages.  I'm glad to see that so many other people responded to it as well.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Brilliant film! Captivating, sincere and sensitive. It's a genuine message of HOPE. However, I think it should have a linearity concerning the use of the language. I've noticed that 50% of this movie alternates between English and Hindi. Why this? From a scene to another, little boy Jamal is speaking his native language, and suddenly while showing the Taj Mahal to that old couple he is speaking a flawless English. It is not clear to the viewer, but I can bet that if this movie had had been entirely filmed in Hindi, probably it would NOT have taken the attention from the U.S. public audience and it would have finished ignored by the Academy. And as well, like a few other brilliant films it would be forgotten in time. But our \\"slumdog\\" here and the rest of the cast speak English fluently and they've made \\"History\\" this year.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|If you have the 18-55mm kit lens that comes with some of the Nikon dSLRs, get this hood. It snaps on easy as pie, comes off just easily, and can be stowed on the lens in reverse position. True, the spring-loaded tabs that hold it on are a bit delicate, buy hey, you're putting it on a precision instrument. If you can handle your camera, you can handle this hood. Great product!
B000IFS0HM|5.0|This book will grab readers from the first page.  Picked it up at an airport and couldn't put it down.  It definitely makes you rethink about what's important in life.
1416562605|4.0|White Tiger is an eye opening view into poverty and the caste system in India.  I was blown away by the style of writing the author used to tell this story.  The role of the servant and the master amid rampant political corruption was told through the eyes of Balram.  He is the servant who knows how to read.  He is street smart and uses what he sees to lift himself out of poverty to the life of riches.  He is not a good person, he only did what he had to do to survive.<br />This is well worth reading.<br />Linda C. Wright<br />Author One Clown Short<br />[[ASIN:1583852204 One Clown Short]]
B001PPGAIA|5.0|\\"Australia\\" is visually well worth watching! The acting is very good. The story is okay. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman have a lot of sex appeal and did the best they could with the screenplay which I felt was a bit hokey. Native Australians are given a lot of attention and respect.     As an American, I don't know much about the life & geography down under, and this movie has seriously motivated me to vacation there just for its sheer beauty.     Oh, I almost forgot. The musical score is stupendous!
0887431453|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who wants to introduce basic preschool concepts to their child.  My 3 year old son devoured it.  I love this book because it breaks it up into sections--pre-writing skills, pre-reading skills, letters, numbers, colors, and shapes.  You can simply tear out one page from each section for each day and do that several days a week and your child will have a comprehensive introduction to preschool.  It's awesome!  Great for someone who feels like they want to teach their child but doesn't know where to start.
B000001FYL|4.0|Great album to show Jon's talent of writing and singing.  Highly recommend this for Bon Jovi fans!
0061684384|5.0|Although I have no tattoos, I am a huge fan of the show (and depending on the content of the episode, so is my 9 year old daughter.) The book in itself is a work of art. It captures the spirit of the show by giving you some insight into Kat, other artists and just everyday people she knows. The attention to detail on each page is simply incredible; from all the photos, down to the individual lettering. You can see the care that was taken putting together this book, and that it was not just slapped together to turn a quick buck off her fame.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I rarely get so excited about an album. I think the last time I felt that way about an album was when MARILLION released MISPLACED CHILDHOOD.  This album gets to you as soon as you listen to it for the first time. You just can't stop listening to it. It's the lyrics, the amazingly well crafted music, indeed the whole atmosphere...You just can't get enough of it. Those who have been listening to progressive rock for a little while may feel that some pieces of this album sound a lot like BARCLAY JAMES HARVEST (specifically Love On The Line). Get it, you will not be disappointed. If, like me, you did not know who Porcupine Tree was, you will be a lifelong fan after you hear this album. Guaranteed!
B00123G6HA|1.0|Please preview the songs before purchasing. I did a one click download of the entire \\"Blow You're Face Out\\" album and it includes only the studio version of \\"Give It To Me.\\" I am not sure if this an Amazon issue or done intentionally by Rhino. I can't find the live version on Amazon.    Other than that this is good stuff. As one reviewer indicated a few of the songs do get tedious and it's not as good as \\"Full House\\" but I would still recommend it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this DVD on Friday and it was at my house on Monday, super quick shipping. Last year I was paying $200 for a class that was 3 days a week for 4 weeks called booty boot camp here in town. As soon as I got this DVD I couldn't wait so I popped it in the player. I can't believe it. I am just as, if not more, sore than I was in that class and for only $8.00 and 20 minutes, Unbelievable. The class was taught by personal trainers and with my wedding coming up in June I was really disappointing I wouldn't be able to afford a comparable workout. Boy was I wrong.     I now remember what I love about working out this hard, I have been able to feel the burn for 2 days, making me want to continue to work out. Instant gratification is a wonderful thing. And that was just Level 1. I am so excited. Thank you Jillian for showing us that we can in fact work out this hard at home.     ****Highly recommended****
1854378546|5.0|FINALLY!     I'm so happy that there is a Marc Boutavant book published / translated  for the US market and what a book! From what I understand this is Mr. Boutavant's first solo book, one that he has both written alone and illustrated and it is a great introduction to his whimsical illustration work!     Little kids (and adults alike!)will love poring over the art of each page, following Mouk's every single step in the various countries he visits. Mr. Boutavant leaves no corner unadorned, which invites the reader to gladly re-visit Mouk and his friends over and over!    I hope this book is successful enough in the US that his other books will be translated!

B0002KQNL8|3.0|Ok Everybody know Return Of The Living Dead is Perfect in every way!!! And that ROTLD Part 2 is far from it and it's nowhere near as great as the first one!!! But that being said I thought it was still pretty enjoyable. Ok the main lead Michael or Ken Pennyworth is pretty young in this movie so maybe his acting wasn't world class but it was ok, they should've had Will Smith in here telling him to stop cussing because he was bad at it, like in I'Robot. I did love the return of James Karen and Thom Matthews, that was good they weren't  Frank and Freddy but Ed and Joey were pretty entertaining. The zombies were cool but. But I hated the zombies kid he was just really F**^ing annoying and was he supposed to be scary or something LOL!!!  It did have Susane Snyder in it which I liked! The sister character was likeable I thought , the cable guy was cool too!! My favorite character in this movie is Dr. Mandel he was very funny and likeable and had some funny lines ie \\"your fly is down\\" or \\"must've been a fuse\\" and my \\"favorite Tell me son, have you ever seen a grown man drunk?\\" . Thanks for reading!
B0017T4IG0|4.0|I still don't know why this film isn't available on DVD/Blu-ray yet. Is it because it has a Virgin label on it? Is it because of contractual issues with the soundtrack, which, by the way, is available on CD?      I don't normally write about anything, and the last time I did, it was for Electric Dreams in February 2006. This film from the 80's brought about the subject of artificial intelligence, with style in humor and romance.  You saw life through the eyes and ears of Edgar, the home computer.  Ultimately, Edgar ends up being just as human as we all are.      The film has a great soundtrack, and a great song by Giorgio Moroder (sung by Philip Oakey), \\"Together in Electric Dreams.\\" The story takes place in San Francisco, where the city always makes a genius out of cinematographers. Plus, and it's a big plus, Virginia Madsen's hot in it.     If I have to give a rating, it would be four stars for the film itself, minus one for not being on DVD/Blu-ray.  Please find a way to get this film available to us fans.  My home video collection will always be incomplete without Electric Dreams.
B000002G8H|5.0|This was one of my favorite albums in the 70's.  So when I saw it as a CD I had to have it.  I enjoy listening to it in my car.  Makes me in my twenties again.  Love it now just as much as I did then.
B000A2IPPK|4.0|Kind of irritating that they edited out all the guns that the cops were holding and put radios in their hands.  Stupid to change a classic into a politically correct film.  But the kids still love the show and it does still have its sense of magic.
B0012Q732O|2.0|I still apologize to the significant other.  When 10,000 B.C. first came out I bought in to all the marketing hype and dragged her to the cinema.  It didn't take 20 minutes before I issued my first apology; by the time the film was over I was groveling.  But she was a good sport about it.  (Thank goodness.)<br /><br />I recently caught this howler on cable; a clunker is a clunker, but watching a clunker still beats cleaning the commode (but not by much), so I pulled up a chair and allowed the ridiculous tale that is 10,000 B.C. unfold.  A clan of hunters (and they hunt the big boys, the woolly mammoths) living in the Alps gets their prized possession (a blue-eyed chick) stolen by evil slave traders.  Led by young D'Leh (Steven Strait, who no doubt is still thanking his agent), a small group pursues; hiking only a couple of days, they're suddenly in a steamy jungle (Europe is well known for having them); hiking a couple more, they're in barren north Africa (no need to cross that pesky Mediterranean).  Magically uniting countless nomadic tribes, they assault a massive, pre-Egyptian city being constructed (by the blue-eyed chick and thousands of other slaves).  All the while, the dialogue, plot, pacing, goes from laughable, to hysterical, then back to laughable.<br /><br />One thing I will say for director Roland Emmerich:  Dude can bring visuals to a movie.  There are some impressive vistas, and the CGI mammoths were equally impressive.  As for Strait, he could definitely use a good dose of [[ASIN:B0018PG2HG Pert Plus]].  Camilla Belle looks good as the blue-eyed chick.  Yet visuals alone do not a passable movie make; 10,000 B.C. is proof of that.  If you don't believe me, just ask those prehistoric, flesh-eating ostriches who await you in that steaming European jungle.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B000BNX3B4|3.0|This is certainly a watchable movie and worth buying. I love romatic movies in which two people who seem unfit for each other for some reason end up together in the end. This movie tries to be that but messes it up. The main character is a teacher, and it seem for all the world in the first half of the movie that she's going to end up with the perfect-guy father of one of her students. The Cusack character has a go at it every so often but it doesn't seem right. However, in the end she ends with him and the last scene of the movie is one in which they are shopping together and seem completely unbelievable as a couple. It's sort of like the time to end the movie came around so the two quickly ended up together. Other than that, it isn't a bad movie and there are some fun scenes. Dianne Lane does a pretty decent job with her character and the dad is an interesting character. If you go into this one realizing it's decent but not a top-shelf romantic movie, you'll like it. Finally, the Dog theme seems really forced and doesn't end up having much of a real effect on the movie.
B001P5Q6FC|4.0|First of all I'll say that \\"As the Palace Burns\\" is my favorite LoG album, and with the last two I enjoyed them but thought they lacked some of rawness of \\"As the Palace Burns.\\" I think \\"Wrath\\" brings some of that energy back while showing good growth for the band. Simply put: me like and me highly recommend.
B0002TJGQS|1.0|A perfect example, unfortunately, of getting less than what I hoped. These batteries last, at best, a quarter as long as Duracell/Energizer.

1594481938|2.0|I recently struggled to finish a Long Way Down.  While it isn't poorly written by any means, and I surely appreciate Mr. Hornby's sense of humor.  I found the plot to be fairly pedantic and boring.

B000V86OKG|5.0|Can you believe HBO passed on this? Dexter is full of suspense, creativity and is certainly a one of a kind. I keep watching the first two seasons over and over again, finding new aspects with every viewing. The acting is also superb, never leaving the viewer to feel cheated. Dexter has a perfect blend of elements (not focusing on recreating violent acts or faking sex scenes.) I am yet to find a television production that tops Dexter. Wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars.
0312360266|2.0|I borrowed this series from a friend and I thought the story sounded decent, but now that I have read the 5th book I don't recommend even starting this series.  This book was a promising start to this new world, but the main character remains stagnant throughout all 5 books. This series is about a high school student named Zoey that gets marked to go through the change of becoming a vampire. In her world, humans are aware of vampires.  I skimmed through most of the book because the writing style was so irritating.  But, the story was promising so I continued to read hoping the characters would grow and to hope that I didn't waste time.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and will not invest any more of my valuable reading time on this series.      If you are looking for a great paranormal young adult series, I would recommend The Vampire Academy Series by Richelle Mead.
0670069124|2.0|Gosh this thing was sloooooooooow reading. I guess I'm glad I hung with it until the end because that was the only interesting part.

0739368435|5.0|This audio book is a shear delight. Multiple narrators add so much to one's listening pleasure.  The book is narrated with such passion that one becomes totally engaged with each character. The book unfolds through a series of letters to an author who is contemplating writing a book about Guersey and the experiences each character has had with the German occupation of the island during World War II. Such disturbing subject matter is related with poignant and at times funny anecdotes. I have found myself wanting to know more and more of Guersey and of what took place there. The characters take on such life that it is hard to believe that they never existed. This book delivers a picture of WWII, the destruction and occupation, the way everyday people dealt with survival that one rarily gets a chance to understand. I highly recommend this beautiful, and delightful book to anyone.

B001ECQ75A|2.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time.  But finally having done so I am disappointed.  It was amusing and the animation is good, but it is much too violent for children younger than preteen. The reviews stated that it was great family entertainment for ages 3 and up. I have a son who will shortly be turning 4 and found it unsuitable viewing for him. We were watching it as a family and found ourselves (my husband and I) horrified that we had exposed our son to such violence. I feel that the movie was misrepresented - all the previews depict is as being light and funny, and the reviews on amazon, as I stated before, suggested it was suitable for ages 3 and up.  I am no prude but this film is clearly not appropriate for anyone that young.  The violence was extreme and vicious, even by adult standards.  It should have been advertised as such.

But, naturally, music can differ so greatly from one song to another that you can't really depend on reviews from someone else to say if your going to like it or not. Personally I love this cd, and if your into rock, you'll probably like it too. Give it a shot, I'm willing to bet you'll be shocked at how good it is just like I was XD

B0010X73ZG|5.0|I'm not sure why someone would not enjoy this film, especially if they had read the novela. It has SUCCESSFULLY captured the horror of the situation that King had put this small community in. Many mixed feelings about the ending. The written story does suggest the films ending to have been a possability, so anyone who has read the story already filled in the blanks in their own way. The films creators did the same thing. One thing though, umm... excuse me David Drayton (main character), couldn't you have (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) waited until you all were in immediate danger BEFORE you just, ya know.... POP!POP!POP!POP! ?

B001KVZ6ES|5.0|\\"Clint Eastwood's GRAN TORINO, \\"A White American Tragedy<br />about Hmong People,\\" reviewed in the eyes of a Combat Veteran\\" - 5 stars<br /><br />I returned home from seeing Gran Torino feeling very emotional.  I had to get these feelings off my chest and so is one's veteran opinion about the fictitious Walt Kowalsky, a Korean combat veteran.  I feel I understood what the screenwriter of this fictional story was trying to teach us.  A Chinese American's review seems to be most accurate:  \\"You people [reviewers] are, as Walt Kowalski might say, are a bunch of jabbering dimwits.\\"<br /><br />For all the reviewers who would rewrite the screen, note that you did not produce this movie which is destined to become an Academy winner.  Some of you expressed that the movie's hero should not have been about a White American but a hero of color -  but isn't that in itself a little racist? The movie is about the story presented and if only the critics could write successfully, they might not be so critical.  Many obvious facts can be easily assumed - so if I say that something is so in this review that was not said in the movie - it did not need saying - I know and many know- especially the vet.<br /><br />Gran Torino also provides an introduction to the American people of a unique Ethnic group - the Hmong whom Walt at first hated but got to love as his only real family. The story is about an older Korean vet (like most) who came back home worked hard, retired, then lost his wife, and held on to good basic life values.  Likely, he was never offered any treatment for his obvious chronic PTSD - so he has a few personality quirks.  He has the eyes of many aging American combat veterans in a changing American environment.  This movie perhaps is one of the most accurate reflections as to of what has happened to this country since the end of the Korean War.<br /><br />Walt or Mr. Kowalsky, as he was for his Hmong neighbors, is a real American hero.  We need more Walt's today in this country.  The young Hmong hero (Thoa- Walt's aka \\"Toad\\") learns to use a calm head when communities face difficulties.  He sets a good example as Walt helps reform him for his attempted theft of Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino that Walt help build on a Detroit factory assembly line.  Sure some Walt comments will get racial purists uptight.  However, I feel many often see a racist under every bed as the problem while neglecting their main issues.  Aren't the objected comments among many Walt-stereotyped blue-collared people more real than not?  Walt did not retreat in war nor today in his community when its racial color changed.  Although he could have moved away as encouraged by his children, he did not go to the suburbs where his former white neighbors and his children escaped.  He stayed.  So really isn't he much less a racist than the overwhelming majority of whites in this country who abandoned their former beautiful neighborhoods - now decaying - that have been overtaken by new ethnic peoples and the poor.  Look at Boston, LA, Detroit and all the big cities!  The movers and most critics do not have to say racist comments, their racism clearly is demonstrated.<br /><br />So what if he was a cranky old (80 years old?) man often saying things that \\"good proper Americans\\" should not say.  Our movies need to be about real people instead of an idealist pure people.  The story shows he hated his new Hmong neighbors until he reluctantly discovered that they were good people and who became his new \\"family.\\"  As a 100% disabled combat Vietnam veteran (Special Operation Forces), I know that if you experienced what he did 55 years earlier (killing 13 enemy including a young 17 year old), your perceptions will differ little from Walt's.  After his wife died, he rejected his young priest's many efforts to effect his late wife's request for him to confess his sins. He kept his War secrets to himself.  He never discussed his War story even with his family - keeping his medals hid in a trunk in the basement.  But he did share it for a few short moments with Thao and that is central to the movie's theme.  We know that war takes a tolling affect on all warriors with a conscience- often with daily intrusions until death do them part.  Many veterans perceptions to societal changes are easily different than non-veterans.  Sometimes justifiably experienced in today's world when they see what is happening to their country for which they offered their supreme sacrifice.<br /><br />The truth is that most Korean and Vietnam veterans have referred to  their Asian enemy as gooks.  Many combat vets are easily triggered emotionally even on the sight of Asians or recollections from that period of their life.  After all, the military inspired within its combat troops that a gook was lower than a dog so that it was okay to kill him unless you allowed him to kill you.  So within the soul of many combat veterans rest this disturbing feeling that is real in their perceptions and often nightly dreams.  Don't we know that \\"war is hell\\" enough to emotionally to defeat even the best?  Yet these veterans often came home often to an uncaring people who supposedly \\"were against war.\\"  But we should know that the strongest desires for peace always rest with the soldier.  Wasn't Walt trying to teach Thoa and share his experience to avoid violence because it can hurt a person's soul for a very long time.  Yet there comes a time after though when the proper person must take the risk.<br /><br />Retired White auto blue-collar workers' comments are no doubt a reaction to their  former enemies successful assumption of their American automobile manufacture as Americans adopted foreign cars and left their people unemployed.  It does not seem right for those who won the war to lose their jobs to those we helped (Koreans) or defeated (Japanese, Germans, and Italians).  If that was enough then new foreign people take over their neighborhoods.  [Anyone want a house in Flint MI for a dollar?- there are many available.]  How would you feel if your neighborhood turned into a dump because of this transition? Furthermore, unless you are blind, you must realize that minority Gangs throughout the US have an unduly affect on the poorer inner communities.  These young gangsters are subjected to constant crime and use of drugs with little hope of escape.  Most gangs are comprised- but not exclusively- today of young men of color.  Yes, Walt saw Sue Lor's white male friend unable to stand up for her when abused by a small gang of black thugs.  Walt fought the gang's destruction of his neighborhood and abuse of its Hmong peoples.  If we only had more leaders and judges who stood against this encroachment crime into our society.<br /><br />Walt knew that neither he nor the Hmong could not depend on the police to help.  He realized that this fight was best for him.  In the same way, many veterans realize that we or our allies should not depend on our military.  This movie is reflects the USA's authoritative failures to not help our allies the Hmong then and today in their new US depressed communities. Look at the story of the Hmong people.  Major General Vang Pao,  their war hero who for two decades led the Hmong in their fight against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces, repeated his comrades story, \\"If the United States won't help us, they should drop a bomb on us so we won't suffer any more.\\"  The story of the Hmong, a primitive people, has been a story of US neglect and betrayal.  They were our most faithful and courageous allies during the Vietnam war.  The USA paid and encouraged them to resist the advance of Communism in Southeast Asia.  But the USA abandoned them and left them to a precarious fate when the Laotian domino collapsed in 1975.  The USA government lied and denied this operation for years until Clinton Administrations confession that the USA was the primary instigating Hmong support in Southeast Asia wars.  Today and after our confession, there still continues a genocide of thousands Hmong by the communist Lao government.  Only a few have been relocated to US Hmong Communities.  Most Hmong have been slaughtered.  These are the same people who covertly made the Ho Chi Minh trail almost impassable for the NVA to resupply military equipment to kill our soldiers.  Their actions saved innumerable lives (US and ARVN) from bloodbaths by the enemy.  Don't we owe them more respect and support?<br /><br />Are there similar stories going on today in America?  Certainly, we need more Walt's to stand up and help the Hmong.  One example of a White American accused of helping the Hmong is former Ranger Harrison Jack.  The Federal Government today continues his and the Hmong betrayal.  Our US Justice Department has indicted the retired Lieutenant Colonel Jack for a flimsy Sacramento Federal criminal case on violation of the Neutrality Act.  Also indicted in the two year old continuing case are General Vang Pao and ten (10) other Hmong Americans.  Colonel Jack led covert operations and worked with Hmong fighters during the Vietnam War. The federal indictment today describes him as the middle man between the Hmong defendants and their presumed arms dealer.  Rangers are taught to never leave their comrades behind but to make every effort to save them and bring them home safe.  What he is wrongly accused is exactly what the US Government should have been doing to resolve this overdue problem.  The US Justice Department has ridiculously exaggerated and fabricated a case of entrapment at best against Colonel Jack and the Hmong \\"conspirators\\" to provide arms for those who have not given up the fight.  Perhaps this criminal case will be an exciting future Hmong movie that Clint Eastwood will sponsor.  Knowledge of the facts in this case should also be mandatory reading for Allies of any potential US military operations.

Only a few have been relocated to US Hmong Communities.  Most Hmong have been slaughtered.  These are the same people who covertly made the Ho Chi Minh trail almost impassable for the NVA to resupply military equipment to kill our soldiers.  Their actions saved innumerable lives (US and ARVN) from bloodbaths by the enemy.  Don't we owe them more respect and support?    Are there similar stories going on today in America?  Certainly, we need more Walt's to stand up and help the Hmong.  One example of a White American accused of helping the Hmong is former Ranger Harrison Jack.  The Federal Government today continues his and the Hmong betrayal.  Our US Justice Department has indicted the retired Lieutenant Colonel Jack for a flimsy Sacramento Federal criminal case on violation of the Neutrality Act.  Also indicted in the two year old continuing case are General Vang Pao and ten (10) other Hmong Americans.  Colonel Jack led covert operations and worked with Hmong fighters during the Vietnam War. The federal indictment today describes him as the middle man between the Hmong defendants and their presumed arms dealer.  Rangers are taught to never leave their comrades behind but to make every effort to save them and bring them home safe.  What he is wrongly accused is exactly what the US Government should have been doing to resolve this overdue problem.  The US Justice Department has ridiculously exaggerated and fabricated a case of entrapment at best against Colonel Jack and the Hmong \\"conspirators\\" to provide arms for those who have not given up the fight.  Perhaps this criminal case will be an exciting future Hmong movie that Clint Eastwood will sponsor.  Knowledge of the facts in this case should also be mandatory reading for Allies of any potential US military operations.

That made me want the CD, which I bought yesterday. So far my favorite songs are 'Pocketbook' and 'If This Isn't Love'. I'm sure the more I listen to the CD, I will grow to love more of the songs.
0143038095|5.0|Amy Tan's first novel, The Joy Luck Club, follows the stories of four Chinese women living in America and their grown daughters.  The narrator shifts in each chapter, allowing the reader a glimpse into the lives and values of each of the eight main characters.  These people have led difficult lives, and kept many aspects of themselves hidden from their family members.  As they explore their past and present, the reader begins to feel connected to this group of people.    Tan does a great job showing the Chinese culture and way of thinking in an interesting and creative way.  Each chapter reads more like a short story.  I found myself getting the characters confused near the end, as I tried to remember what else I'd already learned about them, but rather than be a nuisance it just made me want to read the book again.  The characters are realistic, entertaining, and insightful.    Themes include the relationship between mothers and daughters, secrets, dignity, guilt, and what it means to be an American.  It is a book I would recommend to anyone interested in a good read, multicultural families, and just a book about what it means to live life.

1902040457|5.0|I am not a dealer or professional numismatist. I have no doubt that this book offers good value for the professional, but it is especially important for the general collector of Roman coins.  I have all five volumes in Sears' series and have nothing but praise for each of them.<br /><br />Each volume is introduced by a very useful introduction to the basics of Roman coinage: Mints, denominations, reverse types, inscriptions, and so on.  There is a wealth of information here from which even the seasoned collector may benefit.<br /><br />Each person appearing on the obverse of a coin is given his/her own listing, so you don't have to go looking under Antoninus Pius for listings of Faustina's coins, or under Caracalla for issues of Plautilla and so on.<br /><br />The historical and biographical background has been expanded from Sears' earlier editions and the number of coin varieties and reverse types has easily been quadrupled compared to the previous editions.  The coins are separated by denominations and then arranged alphabetically by reverse types, so coin attribution is made very easy. They are not sorted by mint, unlike RIC, and this fact alone makes Sear's system far easier to use. The vast majority of coins a typical collector might acquire is represented in these catalogs.  Even the large, multi-volume catalogs such as the monumental RIC cannot list everything.<br /><br />Cross references are made to other standard works, such as RIC (Roman Imperial Coins), the BMCRE (British Museum Collection, Roman Empire), RSC (Roman Silver Coins--which uses Cohen numbers) and Hill.  Unlike RIC or BMC, each coin is given a unique Sear number, from 1-12,432. Thus, there is never any confusion as to which number refers to which coin.<br /><br />Representative coins are illustrated in actual size by high-quality black and white photographs and sprinkled liberally throughout the listings.  About four coin illustrations per page is typical.<br /><br />Values are given in British Pounds for three grades, which gives one a rough guide to relative price, but no catalog is able to reflect true market prices accurately and this should not be taken as a shortcoming.<br /><br />In short, Sears' catalogs are the best on the market by far.  I have RIC, Van Meter and Vagi, and Sears is the one I return to time and again.relative price, but no catalog is able to reflect true market prices accurately and this should not be taken as a shortcoming.

B001ACH4DS|4.0|I didn't really have all the high expectations that everyone else did from David Cook's first outing.  I didn't follow him on Idol, mainly because that show is not something I can watch.  However, there was no denying that Cook was the most talented person on that show and deserved to win.<br /><br />His first album is quite good - it doesn't rock nearly as much as Daughtry's, but it's got a few good rock songs on it. His voice is undeniably good - his range and pitch are amazing. The hooks are very catchy, and the production value is quite high.<br /><br />Where I think the album stumbles is in how predictable the songs are. Just about every single song goes like this:<br /><br />Intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, sing chorus one octave lower without instruments, crescendo into final chorus.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - they're still good songs, but just really predictable. Every song has the same formula (with the exception of maybe the last four tracks, which happen to be my favorites), and after a few listens it becomes a little repetitive.<br /><br />There's still no denying Cook's talent (singing, songwriting), and it's still a very strong debut album. Maybe it's unfair to compare it to Daughtry's debut (which was my favorite album of last year), but it just falls a little short.<br /><br />I have a feeling Cook couldn't really execute the kind of album he wanted to due to American Idol's expectations of what they wanted him to produce. I'm hoping he really breaks free on his next album!

1878424505|5.0|Most books I have read regarding spirituality and peace hail from Eastern philosophy and thinking. This book was based on Latin American teachings and philosophies. It is based on the Toltec teachings which were built from a foundation of faith, religion, and science. The first chapter talks about how the four agreements were so powerful they were kept a secret to prevent outsiders from abusing the secrets and powers handed down from master to master. This caused skeptisism on my part. But after reading on, I found myself truly understanding and embracing the four agreements.  All four agreements are based from the individual and the personal freedom it creates. The agreements are so basic and simple, but yet so productive if carried out and used. This book is a must read for anyone who has troubles in their life caused by outside factors and are overly sensitive to other peoples actions and words. It is a quick read but a great read.
B000M9BPEY|4.0|This story is very good, what else would you expect from a Burton/Elfman combo?  It's a great mixture of fantasy with reality and will be a movie you want to watch over and over again!<br /><br />I know that it was re-done into bluray so it wouldn't be as good as newer movie releases, but it still fell a little short of my expectations.<br /><br />****Contains Some Spoilers****<br /><br />This movie is about a man, Ed Bloom, who told stories all his life OF his life.  Now he's old and dying and his only son, Will (who is recently married and expecting a child of his own), has come to see him after years of not speaking.  As Will grew older he began to see the \\"lies\\" or embellishments of his father's stories and only wanted the straight-up truth--which is something Ed just wasn't capable of.  Will since dismissed everything his father ever told him about himself and went on to live his very practical and clean-cut life. It is not until his father's funeral, when he meets all the characters from his father's life stories, that Will sees his father really was telling the truth about his life and only added a little imagination and fantasy to his stories.

B001N3OCV6|3.0|Whether you liked the placement of the music in the movie or not you have to admit that it did use some great oldies. After viewing the film I could not get some of the songs out of my head so I picked up the soundtrack. For the most part it is pretty solid but it does have some duds as well.<br /><br />Highs<br />*The Times They are A-Changin - This song was used beautifully in the film and it sounds just as good out of it.<br />*The Sound of Silence - My favorite song on the CD.<br />*All Along the Watchtower - It's Hendrix, there is not much to add here.<br /><br />Most people already know these songs, so there is not much to say considering you probably already have an opinion on them. Now for the lows..<br /><br />Lows<br />*Desolation Row - Not a big fan of MCR, I skip over it every time.<br />*Hallelujah - It just seems out of place and does not really mesh with the rest of the CD.<br />*You're My Thrill - Pretty much the same as above.<br /><br />There are some other songs that I am not that fond of but these three are probably my least favorite. Overall the CD can be a mixed bag but I am overall pleased with my purchase.
0061478784|4.0|Sophie is sure that her life is meant to come to nothing, because where she lives the eldest child is always ill-fated. So when times get tough for her family she is content to stay home and work in the family hat shop while her two younger sisters go off to bright futures working in a bakery and learning magic. But when the Witch of the Waste comes into her shop one day and casts a spell on Sophie, making her appear old, she decides to set off into the wider world where she knows no one.    When her old bones become tired at the end of her first day of wandering, she finds herself at the edge of the wizard Howl's castle. The castle is enchanted; it moves and blows puffs of smoke constantly. Although Sophie is afraid of Howl because she heard he eats young girls' souls, in the guise of an old woman she thinks she will be safe. With thoughts of finding a warm fireside and a comfy chair, Sophie goes into the castle.    She finds Howl's assistant Michael, and his fire demon, Calcifer, but Howl is not in. As Sophie makes herself useful and becomes a part of the castle life, she begins to learn more and more about Howl, Calcifer and Michael. Gradually, as she gets to know them, they become like a second family to her. But can she keep Howl from being taken by the Witch of the Waste? And can she break a magical spell that binds Calcifer to Howl, so the spell on her can be broken as well?    Howl's Moving Castle brings up issues of creating family for yourself and seeing people for who they truly are, despite the masks they put up to keep others at a distance. It's about finding love and acceptance, and not being afraid to look for the magic in small moments. The castle itself is fascinating, with its door leading to different villages depending on which colored-button is facing down, its ability to move its location and its permanent window looking onto a sunny port town. Our mother-daughter book club members thought the ending felt a bit rushed, but otherwise we all enjoyed reading it and talking about Sophie, Howl and all the characters. I recommend it for book clubs with daughters aged 13 and up.

B00004W4UB|4.0|I am glad to see other reviewers praising this \\"underrated\\"  film. I figured I was the only person who actually liked it, but I guess not. All the national critics sure hated this low-key retelling of Jekyll and Hyde.   Despite critics' comments to contrary, I found this an intelligent adaptation of the famous story.    The muted colors with the grey overtones caught my eye and were very interesting to observe. Julia Roberts also was interesting to watch: no makeup, no smile, just sad, somber looks yet still appealing.  People don't care for subtly in films anymore. They want in-your-face smash-ups, gore, violent conflicts....and a lot of it. This movie is extremely low-key.    I have to admit that it's hard to believe Roberts' character \\"Mary Reilly\\" would not recognize Jekyll from Hyde (played by John Malkovich) when he didn't change facial appearances! And, yes, the film, generally-speaking, is a real downer. Yet, for some odd reason, despite the above paragraph, I recommend the film to people who enjoy slower films and slow suspense, even if they have to suspend a little believability. I thought it was oddly fascinating.

B0001HLVS2|5.0|What a magnificent adventure story, pure and simple.    It's unusual in that there are only two action scenes over the 2 hour, 19-minute film, one near the beginning and one near the end. They don't go on that long, either. For a modern-day film, that's very unusual.    However, that doesn't translate to infer this is too talky or boring. The film will keep your interest all the way. However, for any ladies out there looking for a bit romance in this tale, it isn't there. In that respect, unless you want to ogle at Russell Crowe, this a man's film with an all-male cast.    This movie is a great demo on how to make an adventure film fascinating without blood and guts and explosions every two minutes. It's an heroic tale, right down a little boy who shows us what guts are all about. One tip for those having trouble with some of the accents or naval terminology: put on the English subtitles. You'll be glad you did.    This movie won the Academy Award for both cinematography and sound and both honors were well-deserved. The creaking of the ship coming out of all the surround speakers is awesome, just in itself. I was so pumped to see this on Blu-Ray, but the transfer wasn't much better than the regular DVD, so save your money on that one.
0143039482|4.0|John Steinbeck shows true artistry of dialogue in this book set in New England in the 1950s. The protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, conveys every bit of his is misfortune (or missed fortune, as the case may be) and everyman, grocery store clerk persona in his words along with something deeper, darker, and perhaps undetectable to one who isn't privy to what haunts his mind at night. He is a delightful character, despite his self-indulgence. Although the plot is slow and relies heavily on somewhat unbelievable coincidences, the story is chock-full of brilliant dialogue. You can practically see the scenes in black and white in your mind with a Jimmy Stewart-esque Ethan tapping out the language in a beautiful staccato song of times gone by.
0790731452|5.0|What a wild movie! I've begun to appreciate this more and more with multiple viewings. After a half-dozen looks in over a decade, I still think it's Tim Burton's most underrated film.  I'd love to see this in Blu-Ray.    The film is a combination of science fiction, drama and comedy. It's a parody of the 1950s flying saucer films except it has 1990s color and good special-effects. Burton was a fan of those corny '50s sci-fi films so he made his own!    The story quickly moves from one character to another, from the low-key President of the U.S. played by an unusually-reserved Jack Nicholson to the wacky New Ager Annette Benning to Martin Short with his goofy smile....well, there are so many characters here - most of them completely wacked - it's too many to mention. The diversity of these people and the subtle humor in which they are all presented is just as much fun to watch as the special-effects.    The Martians, meanwhile, are a real hoot. They have to be seen to be believed.
B000244FDW|3.0|Although my title is a bit tongue in cheek, this version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is not quite as fulfilling as the BBC version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth that would come a decade and a half later. If you love the regency era, however, you'll enjoy looking at the costumes and sets. And it's a satisfying visual adventure for any P&P lover. The sets do seem a bit cramped, as if it's Longbourne in a sound stage instead of just Longbourne, but, of course, I was spoiled with the cinematography of the BBC version before I watched this. If this is your first Pride and Prejudice movie experience, skip it and try the BBC version or the Kiera Knightley version (if you don't have six hours) first. But for the lover of all things P&P, it's a must-see.
B0015519VS|3.0|After multiple listens of Usher's lastest album Here I Stand, I honestly like it. Before when it was first released and I took a listen I didnt care for it simply because I probably did with so many people did, compared it to 8701 and Confessions...Which is a big NO-NO because this album is on a whole different playing field.<br /><br />I had doubts about this album when I first heard \\"Love in this club\\", I was like \\"huh\\" (scratching my head) wondering why Usher would release a song talking about \\"Love\\" in a club, beats me. But anyway recently I heard the two songs \\"Appetite\\" & \\"Before I Met You\\" and simply fell in love. I decided to give the album another chance. Lyrically, vocally, and production wise this album is very good and it shows Usher's growth. Even though there's still some areas that could be worked on but its nothing to major.<br /><br />Ratings of tracks on a 10point scale:<br /><br /> 1. Intro<br /> 2. Love In This Club - (featuring Young Jeezy) (6/10) For a single I guess it served its purpose.<br /> 3. This Ain't Sex  (6/10) I like the production, lyrically I'm not fond of the song.<br /> 4. Trading Places (7/10) Took a few listens, but I like.<br /> 5. Moving Mountains (10/10) This song always touches me especially toward the end<br /> 6. What's Your Name - (featuring Will.I.Am) (5/10) I normally don't skip this song but its not a song I would put on repeat.<br /> 7. Prayer For You (Interlude)(5/10) Cute, its fits the album since its mostly about parent hood, marriage and growth.<br /> 8. Something Special (5/10) Nice song but nothing I would put on repeat<br /> 9. Love You Gently (10/10)<br /> 10. Best Thing - (featuring Jay-Z) (7/10) Everything on this song fits, just not a favorite of mines.<br /> 11. Before I Met You (10/10)<br /> 12. His Mistakes  (10/10)<br /> 13. Appetite  (10/10) The song that made me re-listen to the album<br /> 14. What's A Man To Do  (9/10)<br /> 15. Lifetime (8/10)<br /> 16. Love In This Club Part II - (featuring Lil Wayne/Beyonce) (7/10) Like the guest appearances, especially Beyonce.<br /> 17. Here I Stand (6/10) Not to fond of the song-but it works, like the melody and arrangement though<br /> 18. Will Work For Love (7/10) Love the lyrics but its not as catchy as I would want it<br /><br />Top Tracks:<br />Appetite<br />Before I met you<br />Love you gently<br />Moving Mountains<br />His Mistakes<br /><br />Grade: 127/170=74% C<br /><br />Overall this album is very different from his others and it should be. He has grown and made changes in his life and this album reflects that. But I am looking for the next album to have a little of the old Usher in there.ly Beyonce.   17. Here I Stand (6/10) Not to fond of the song-but it works, like the melody and arrangement though   18.

He has grown and made changes in his life and this album reflects that. But I am looking for the next album to have a little of the old Usher in there.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|Ok, I am a huge Soundgarden fan and Chris Cornell has one powerful voice. Oddly enough his solo works have never been that good but his voice could shine anywhere. He has one of the most solid voices in all of music. Because of this (and the fact there was a special for $4.99) I decided to give it a try. I must say I am pleasantly surprised at how good this is.<br /><br />I'll admit I'd rather hear him doing Soundgarden stuff again but we know that's not going to happen. Whether this is a phase or a new direction its good to hear him back with some new material. If you are on the edge about whether to get it, give it a try. It's pretty unique for him.

0743487591|5.0|I read quite a but, but this book is undeniably my favorite.  I first picked it up my junior year of high school, and while the first couple chapters failed to capture my interest I decided to keep reading.  I am SO glad I did, after a while I could not put it down.<br /><br />This book has just about everything- satire, reflections on women in society and family, wit, humor, romance, irony, constantly twisting and turning with surprises... the list goes on.  Most of all, it just has this inexplicable quality that keeps you enraptured throughout the whole read.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone.

B001TODCII|5.0|As if the lousy economy weren't enough of a reason to say &#34;Hells to the no!&#34; when your kids plead and beg to go on a European jaunt, here comes TAKEN, a film that you can show on a back-to-back-to-back screening marathon along with the HOSTEL frightfests. That should make the kids waver a bit. And I bet those poor souls in HOSTEL were wishing for a parent like Liam Neeson. My favorite part of TAKEN may well be the low key yet very ominous promise Neeson makes on the phone to the kidnappers who had just snatched his daughter. I got dem shivers of anticipation coursing up and down the spine, watching him deliver this speech in the film trailer; in the actual film, it resonates with even more power. And I'm sorry - I need to quote him:<br /><br />&#34;I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have... are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that will be the end of it. I will not look for you. I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.&#34;<br /><br />The response: &#34;Good luck.&#34;<br /><br />Oh, it is so on now!<br /><br />Plot, simple: Ex-black ops agent Bryan Mills (Neeson) retired so that he can spend time with his neglected 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), although nowadays Kim doesn't really have much time for him. But she manages to guilt him into signing his permission for her to go holidaying in Europe. Mills doesn't like it one bit. He knows how the real world works, but his daughter just wants to follow a rock band as it tours across Europe. Mills' worst fears surface when Kim and her friend are promptly kidnapped in Paris. Except Bryan Mills isn't your ordinary dad.<br /><br />Clocking in at slightly over an hour and a half, TAKEN is a stripped-down, bare-knuckled thriller; it doesn't try to be fancy, doesn't overcomplicate the story. It's about a father, trained in espionage and combat, willing to do whatever is needed, willing to take on anyone in his way, to get his daughter back. And that's it. Above all, this movie works because it's Liam Neeson propelling the story. Neeson is a first-rate actor and the man can convey seething rage and righteous fury like nobody's business. And, for someone somewhat in his dotage, he brings such big physical presence to the screen that you buy into his character being this dangerous and capable and ruthless.<br /><br />A geriatric version of Jack Bauer? Yes - this man does not eff around. Some of the brutal things Mills resorts to has him straddling the fence between good guy and villain. But I tend to forgive him, given what's driving him. But, heh, it's pretty much a given that his friendship with his French contact is now effectively ruined.<br /><br />Holes in the film? Yes, some. Although it's just about a given that Mills is able to survive hail after hail of bullets; that just seems to go with the territory, in these films. But Bryan Mills, impressive spy skills aside, does get by some on preposterous sheer luck (especially with the jacket). And then, after wreaking so much havoc in Paris, he seemingly is able to get out of France with his daughter fairly easily. See, father and daughter reunite and hug it out in Paris. Next thing you know, they're strolling in L.A.X. (although, okay, for all we know, they may have spent frustrating weeks in Paris swimming thru red tape; the movie doesn't indicate how much time has elapsed). My biggest gripe lies in the shakedown scene, when Mills accosts the Albanians in their HQ and pretends to be French authority - while talking in English with not even a French accent, much less actually speaking in French. And the saps buy this? Unless, of course, Mills pulled the old Jedi mind trick on them. In which case, it all makes sense.<br /><br />But I'm just nagging. Liam Neeson is so good an actor that for the most part he sweeps you into his character's obsessed hunt. Regardless of plot inconsistencies and action movie cliches, TAKEN turns out to be a lean and mean thriller, and worth watching. And Liam Neeson, he runs this joint.m just nagging.

B00005JMJG|5.0|If Jim Carrey is wondering what to do with himself, he needs to go back to material like this. He is a seriously underrated actor (sneaking in that vulnerable admiration of Courtney Cox in Ace Ventura - Ace Ventura!) since he is mostly a comedian. It's easy enough to cry in this world, but anyone who can see humor and express it personifies what it means to rise above.    ANYWAY, I hope Jim Carrey tunnels into the independent film world. He's probably exhausted his rubber-face stage, but anything off-beat and insightful will re-launch his career.     Everyone was wonderful in this movie, no scene was wasted. Really, for everyone in the cast this was their best work.
B000TM0298|5.0|I have been a Gary Moore fan since 1990 (I was late getting on board), and I have had 19 years of enjoyment from his music. This DVD set has not been officially released in the U.S., so I had been bugging the label about a release here. I finally decided to buy any version I could get, and I am glad I did. Five different years are represented here, and all are amazing performances. The sound is awesome throughout, and before someone buys this and complains about a bit of noise in a couple of the years, Gary's guitar does have some noise when he is not playing. I am sure that is because of settings he needs to get the tone he needs. Don't let the few seconds here and there discourage you from buying this. He is without a doubt, one of the most sincere and pure guitarists out there. He can say what he wants with one note, or a flurry of notes that are just not played for flash, but with passion. Gary is brilliant!<br />I have only found one thing I am disappointed in, and that is that the show from 1997 lacks some of the best songs from the tour. While it is a matter of personal taste, the DARK DAYS IN PARADISE tour is my favorite, and a few of the better songs such as LIKE ANGELS were omitted. There must have been good reasons by the company, but it is a lost to me personally. However, the inclusion of BUSINESS AS USUAL more than makes up for it!<br />If you don't know who Gary is, this is a way to get to know this master writer, singer and guitarist. If you do know his music, you probably already rushed to get this! Well worth every penny!!!!

B00003CX9E|5.0|In 1941, after Orson Welles had already made a splash in theater and radio, he headed for Hollywood. The 26-year old whiz kid decided to take on another big name, newspaperman William Randolf Hearst. His first film, Citizen Kane, would be a satire on Hearst's life. Not only would Welles star in the film, but he would also direct and co-write it. Although the film was almost destroyed forever, it can still rightly be called the one of the greatest movies ever made!     The film opens by the deathbed of newspaper mogul Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) just in time to hear his dying word: \\"Rosebud\\". What is Rosebud? That's the question reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) wants answered by any means necessary. Thompson sets out to investigate first-hand accounts of Kane and interview the people who knew him best. Told through flashbacks, Kane's life unfolds from his childhood, his rise to wealth and power in the mass media, his scandalous political career, two disastrous marriages, and his eventual fall. From these events, Thompson tries to piece together Kane's life and solve the mystery of what Rosebud truly is...    With the making of this film, Hearst was outraged. Hearst and Welles were on a collision course and their two enormous egos clashed. Hearst banned any mention of the film in his media empire and vowed to have the film destroyed and Welles' future career ruined. Fortunately, the latter two did not happen exactly as planned (although neither of them were quite the same afterward), and Citizen Kane survived to be the great film we all know today.     The film is innovative in its use of light and shadow, its non-linear style of storytelling, and Welles' incredible make-up job. He looks totally believable as Charles Foster Kane in all the stages of his adult life. All the shots were meticulously planned and nothing at all was wasted.    The two-disc set of Citizen Kane not only contains the classic film, but also two full-length audio commentaries, storyboards and newsreels, and a two hour documentary called \\"The Battle Over Citizen Kane\\" produced by the PBS series, The American Experience. What more could you ask for?     Overall, this film is essential viewing for any movie fan. I couldn't recommend it any more! 5 stars!

0679745203|4.0|Booker Prize winning The English Patient by Sri-Lankan born Michael Ondaatje is an incredibly original piece of fiction that, despite some lengthy parts, is a very satisfying read.  Adapted into an Academy Award winning movie, it is the story of a young nurse in post World War II Italy who lives in solitude with a burn victim known only as the English patient.  The nurse, Hana, remained in the abandoned and booby-trapped villa to care for the English patient even after everyone there had moved on.  These two found the basis for what comes to be the temporary home of four people: the English Patient, Hana, Hana's late father's best friend Caravaggio, and an Indian sapper named Kip.       The story plays its part differently from the perspective of each of these main characters.  Most of this book is character development; it delves into the past of each character, and switches viewpoints often.  It is a story of love past and present, and the difficulty that World War II posed on people's lives.     The writing style is interesting, and while not unique, not commonly read.  The book does drag at some points, and is not in any way a quick read.  The story jumps around a lot, and while this leads to good character development, can make it hard to get involved with the story.  You feel attachment to the characters, but only one at a time it feels like.  It is filled with solid, interesting themes, but they are separated so much it is hard to see it as a whole.     That being said, it is a good story, with incredibly filled-out characters, and makes for a good, thoughtful read.  The premise makes for one of the most unique plots that I have ever read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a book with theme, thought, and heart.
0930289234|4.0|I picked this up so I could read in prep for the movie. My first \\"graphic novel\\" other than \\"comic books\\" back in my younger days. Overall I found this a very good Sci-Fi adventure. Storyline is as noted, about a 1980's US in which Superheroes have been outlawed and Nixon is still the President. The story includes some very likable characters, as well as some pretty neurotic ones too.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if you've never read a graphic novel and want to try one out. It's a decent story for Sci-Fi buffs too, although maybe lacking a bit of depth you'd normally get in a full length novel.<br /><br />Some nice plot twist to keep you interested / guessing. Takes you back to the Cold War era and the brink of the ultimate showdown.<br /><br />This is definitely not a \\"comic book\\" meant for kids, teenagers perhaps. It's definitely a graphic novel with a mature storyline (murder, violence, gore, reference to rape, etc.).<br /><br />I docked it one star because, although the ending was good, it seemed to fizzle a bit and I found it lacking the power the rest of the novel exhibited.
1878424505|5.0|This Toltec lesson in thinking and in behavior brings together learning from other cultures without necessarily knowing of those cultures.  It is universal, in that teachings of the IChing can be found here, and teachings from Eastern philisophies are here.  The simplicity with which the information is presented is the very essence of its value.  Spiritual learning and growth come from simplicity.  Since the Western mind is so steeped in complication, many things escape the eyes, ears, etc. of all of us.  Life can be simple if we just let ourselves learn to think simply.  Again \\"faith\\" in our being of the \\"light\\" is paramount to transcending this world.  I like this book.  I like the simplicity.  As in every case, I strive to simplify.

1401300529|4.0|The late David Halberstam had a reputation for writing negatively about the Vietnam war like he was on the scene of horrific tragedy when he was really sitting in a bar in Saigon. I got the feeling as I read this book a little bit of that attitude bled over into this book.<br /><br />Halberstam clearly does not like U.S. authority - either military or political. He attacks General MacArthur throughout the book but doesn't put President Truman in the best light either. Of course, both men made mistakes, but Halberstam doesn't seem to give Truman much slack at all which I felt was totally wrong. He gives MacArthur even more grief and that is probably warranted as is some of his opinions on other leads including Ned Almond.<br /><br />His analysis of the war and the aftermath was interesting. In fact, someone not interested in reading the entire book could just read the Final Chapter and Afterword and get a good idea of what Halberstam really thinks and what really happened.<br /><br />This book screams of agenda though which bothers me because Vietnam may have had an agenda but I think Halberstam is a bit disingenuous trying to push an agenda on the Korean war. That is a little unfair to the men that served.<br /><br />The military breakdown of this book is its biggest strength. The play-by-play if you can call it that, is really remarkable and quite an achievement by Halberstam. I also thought the analysis of the Communist powers and their relationship with North Korea was very well thought out. Also, great description of the China lobby as it related to the Nationalist. Makes me want to read more about that issue. Not a lot of analysis of Syngman Rhee and his group which was a negative.<br /><br />If a lot of this book didn't reak of politics I'd give it a higher grade but I just can't because Halberstam is unfair at times throughout.<br /><br />You should read it though if you are interested in a good book on all aspects of the Korean War.
0743298039|3.0|I too must admit that, although I enjoyed the novel overall, I just had to skip a few pages, ok, quite a few pages.  I was somewhat disappointed at the end and my patience was tested at times throughout the book.  I felt that the main character was strong but the details paled in comparison.  Still, not too bad for a first novel.
B000PGTPE6|5.0|I have always loved Bruce Springsteen and randomly caught this on television one day. As soon as I saw the concert, I had to get the CD. It is not your typical Springsteen-it definitely has more of a folk feel than he normally does. However, his arrangements of the traditional songs (When the Saints Go Marching In, This Little Light of Mine, Erie Canal, etc.) are creative. All the musicians in the sessions band are excellent. And, as a musician, I appreciate the fact that there's a great variety of instruments featured: guitar, piano, organ, violin, trumpet, trombone, banjo and more. He lets these musicians truly shine as well-this album is definitely about Bruce Springsteen AND the sessions band. The DVD is also well-made and full of energy. It brings everything to life and is just a lot of fun to watch. HIGHLY recommended to round out anyone's Springsteen collection-or general music collection, for that matter.
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|Wow, the boys of Coldplay sure have fallen from such great heights. These Irish rockers who once mesmerized audiences worldwide with deep and philosophical songs such as \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" are now meandering through such rubbish as \\"Lost!\\" (exclamation point part of the song title) and \\"Lovers in Japan\\" which is an ode to lead singer Pear Martin's Japanese wife: Kate Hudson. While this is a tender moment, the rest of the album is low point after low point, completely lacking in what other releases, such as \\"Ten Summoner's Tales\\" and \\"White Ladder\\" had in abundance: artistic vision.<br /><br />Martin's guitar work on this album is sub par compared to previous records, and his deep growling voice is sounding a bit aged as the years go by. While I applaud Coldplay for their humanitarian work around the world, for not letting fame go to their heads, and bringing pride to those in Ireland, this album should have been left unrecorded. Butter luck next time, Coldplay!

I like the way this concert was presented. I wouldn't change a thing, its simply fantastic the way it is.    The concert is as follows: (You get Double Trouble - Chris Layton on drums, Tommy Shannon on bass, & Reese Wymans on keyboards along with the \\"Allstar\\" musicians):    1. Program Start  2.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|Woody Allen makes another film set in Europe that explores the complex nature of human relationships.  Compared to \\"Match Point\\" and \\"Cassandra's Dream\\", \\"Vicky Christina Barcelona\\" is the weakest one of all.<br /><br />For one, the background narrator of the movie is boring and uninspiring, in spite of being necessary.  Without him, movie would make no sense since there is no other way to learn about emotional and psychological fragility of its main characters.<br /><br />However, the premise of perpetual (love) triangles as a means on maintaining balance in unstable relationships of intellectual (un)equals is just as futile.  We cannot but think by the end of the movie that single people are meant to perpetually search for true love, couples are doomed in their boring, predictable bahaviors and love triangles simply cannot last.  Not even a cast of Hollywood acting favorites can save this film.

0920668364|3.0|Somewhere between the horrified reviews and the glowing ones is this one.<br /><br />Okay, so my wife and I were given this book by a family friend shortly before our daughter was born.  I knew of the book, and so did my wife.  For all of you pop culture savvy readers, this is the book that Joey reads at Emma's 1st birthday party on `Friends'.  So, we were both kind of excited to see what it was all about (on the show he reads it in parts, so you don't get to hear the whole story) but after reading it we passed if over as nothing more than corny saccharine fluff.  I never really planned on reading this book to my daughter much because I personally didn't care too much for it and so I kind of forgot all about it until she pulled it out of her closet and demanded I read it to her.  For some reason she loves it and so I wind up reading it at least once a day now.<br /><br />So, to address the concerns many have had about the oddity of the prose, I am with you on that one.<br /><br />Personally I think that the idea behind the book is sweet, but the way it is executed it rather strange.  Yes, a mother's love never dies, and likewise the love a son has for his mother is a bond rarely broken, but this is just going too far for its own good.  Having the mother sneak into her grown sons window at night to rock him and sing to him just gives me the creeps.  Sure, this is a children's book and so there are always those exaggerations, but this is an exaggeration they could have gone without.<br /><br />Maybe they could have had the mother sing to a photograph of her son, or just leave it at the fact that she drove by his house late at night, which while still somewhat creepy is acceptable.<br /><br />I think that the role reversal at the end is really sweet and touching, and when the son goes home and sings to his newborn daughter I actually cried a bit (misty eyes, not water works) and so I can't say that the book isn't moving at parts (and it is nicely illustrated, even if the illustrations are depicting that oddness) but I will say that it is not as moving or touching as it could have been had it been slightly more realistic and palatable.<br /><br />I read it to her because she wants me to, but this is not a book I'd buy for or recommend to other parents I know.t oddness) but I will say that it is not as moving or touching as it could have been had it been slightly more realistic and palatable.

B00004T1NA|2.0|This is 4th p. tree album and it's the weakest of them all. It seems to be mostly about taking pills and watchin tv and this band is at it's worst (in my opinion) when they are noodling through piano and synthesizer parts with the plodding ambient etheral effect. his voice full of reverb and whiny and tinny. Fear of blank planet was sooo much better, it moved and had more foundation to it. this album sounds like the structure is gone, it just rolls one song into the next getting more depressing as it goes. Listen to first track on fear of... that is when they are at there best, and this album is devoid of any refreshing heavy parts like that are on fear of...  should i even bother with stupid dream? or should i go retro, further back?

1427206031|4.0|I am a regular audio book listener. This is a fantastic novel and audio book.<br /><br />The book itself is a novelization of George Mallory's expedition to Mount Everest. (The cover even proclaims \\"A Novel\\"). It is very well written and flows so smoothly and visually that it almost seems like it was written as a screenplay. The pacing, scenes, and dialogue of this book would really make a terrific movie. In order to avoid spoiling the novel, I've placed some notes on the controversy about this book's historical accuracy at the end of my review.<br /><br />My only qualm about the writing is I wish there could have been more technical details of the climb. I've read \\"Shadow Divers\\" the novelization of the finding of the German WWII submarine off of New Jersey. That novel was filled with details about the science and technique of diving. This novel however doesn't really go beyond mentioning rope, using an ice axe to make climbing holes, and subsisting on mint cakes. I don't even remember the mention of knots or how and why climbers tied themselves together with rope.<br /><br />The narrator of the audio book is one of the best I've heard, doing male/female/British/American voices and accents well. Though I couldn't distinguish between the narrator's male, British characters as well. The narrator's reading was always interesting and never tired, dull, or dry.<br /><br />One note about the CD's. This audio book comes on 9 CD's. I wasn't able to play them on the 10 year old CD player in my car but I was able to play them on my computer (and transfer it to my iPod). My old CD player has had trouble with audio CD's that I burn myself but never with retail ones.<br /><br />------- Spoilers -------<br /><br />This is a novelization. It is debated today whether George Mallory made it to the top of Everest. In this novel, he makes it to the summit. The author doesn't mention the details in the audio book's epilogue about the discovery of Mallory's body in 1999 a few thousand feet from the top. Mallory could have died on his way to or from the summit. The contents in Mallory's pockets also cause controversy. For example, goggles were found in his pockets which can suggest that he had reached the top and was descending during the night. But they could simply have been a spare pair.<br /><br />Another thing found on his body was a letter from Stella Cobden-Sanderson(\\"Mrs. Harrington\\" in the novel). This was never mentioned in the novel.

B001PPLIEQ|5.0|With the successful reboot of the James Bond franchise with [[ASIN:B001DSNELA Casino Royale (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)]], fans speculated what the next adventure would be and who would be the director. With the new look and attitude expertly established by Martin Campbell, the producers made the decision to have Marc Forster helm the next one, Quantum of Solace. At first, he seems like a rather odd candidate to direct as he's known mainly for edgy independent films like [[ASIN:B00005YU1M Monster's Ball]] and the sentimental biopic [[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)]]. However, his choice makes more sense once you realize that his films are predominantly character-driven and Casino Royale had much more of an emphasis on character than most other Bond films.<br /><br />Forster does a surprisingly excellent job creating a lean, no frills revenge story under the guise of a Bond film. He is more than capable of handling the action sequences, of which there are many, and invests us in Bond's personal quest for vengeance all the while fulfilling the usual expectations of a Bond film: beautiful women, death-defying stunts, exotic locales, and world-dominating villains.<br /><br />The first disc features a music video for \\"Another Way to Die\\" with Alicia Keys and Jack White in a slick video done very much in the style of the opening credits sequence.

This included set design, how the extras looked and so on.<br /><br />\\"Start of Shooting\\" examines the daunting task of following up the phenomenonal success of Casino Royale.

When My wife and I decided it was time to clean the dust off the Lord of The Rings and watch it again, I knew I had to purchase the Two Towers to complete the \\"extended version\\" collection. Since I was missing the Two Towers; I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. For anyone that may have seen the Lord of The Rings in the theater and would like to watch the trilogy again.  I STRONGLY recommend obtaining the extended versions of all three!  You will see and understand more of the story You will find as we did; It was well worth the investment!

B00005JPY2|5.0|After years of superhero/comic book/graphic novel adaptations that promised big things but fell just short of their marks (I'm looking your way, \\"The Dark Knight\\"), Zack Snyder's awe-inspiring adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's \\"Watchmen\\" has finally delivered the goods: a truly epic film version of a beloved comics institution that expands on the source material without compromising its vision.  While definitely not for the squeamish or short of attention span (or for the small child someone decided to bring to the theater where I saw it), \\"Watchmen\\" is still one of the few Hollywood products of the past few years that manage to be thoughtful and entertaining at the same time.  In a move that breaks with pretty much every other comic/graphic novel adaptation to come out this decade, \\"Watchmen\\" is set squarely in the real world, or at least in one possible version of it, and the actions of its protagonists don't take place in a fictional city or a vacuum but against a Cold War backdrop of paranoia, fear-mongering, and the looming threat of global annihilation.  The plot leaps back and forth and time and sprawls in all sorts of directions, with violent confrontations sharing space with quieter, more reflective moments, but Snyder manages to keep things moving inexorably forward and maintain tight control of a sizeable ensemble cast throughout.<br /><br />For fans of the book, the setup of the movie should be instantly familiar: the year is 1985, Nixon is still president following the abolition of term limits, the U.S. and the Soviets are at the brink of mutually assured destruction in the face of a showdown over Afghanistan, and costumed heroes have been chased underground following a popular backlash and a governmental ban on their activities.  More important than the similarities in plot, though, is Snyder's shocking level of success in transplanting the world of the book onto the big screen.  While certain aspects of the story naturally had to be excised, the bleak, uncompromising worldview and moral complexity of Moore and Gibbons's book has made it to the screen almost fully intact.  Where Snyder's last directorial effort, \\"300,\\" was generally simplistic, humorless, and excessive, \\"Watchmen\\" by contrast is ambiguous, challenging, darkly comic, and never overreliant on its uniformly excellent special effects.  Some of the fight scenes are a little overly stylized and implausible (though again nowhere as annoyingly so as in \\"300\\"), but given that they take up a few minutes of a film that runs over two and a half hours that's a minor concern at worst.  Besides, Snyder's gritty, grimy portrayal of New York City and the unflinching portrayals of brutality are more than enough to outweigh a little excessive stylization.  The use of music is great as well, with the intro set to Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-changing\\" and the sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" being especially memorable.<br /><br />For a movie accompanied by so much hype (and a clearly large budget), the cast is pretty short on big names, but the relative lack of star power turns out to be something of an advantage, with the sprawling ensemble fitting almost perfectly into their roles and the film's alternate reality without overpowering it.  The juiciest parts go to Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the smirking, misogynistic nihilist Edward \\"The Comedian\\" Blake and Jackie Earle Haley as the tormented vigilante Walter \\"Rorschach\\" Kovacs, and neither disappoints.  The Comedian is an especially ambiguous figure for this genre: he appears on the surface to be (and in many ways is) a bloodthirsty villain, but a closer examination reveals someone who sees past the veneer of civilization to grasp mankind's true (and ugly) nature, and can't think of any reaction beyond laughter.  As played by Morgan, The Comedian is an almost completely irredeemable character, but I still couldn't help finding him at least a little sympathetic.  In the equally pivotal role of Rorschach, Jackie Earle Haley is even more compelling, with the air of menace in his voice (and, later, his face) more than making up for his character's laconic nature.  Much as in the book, Rorschach is as much a force of nature as a character, equally as capable of monstrous violence as of heroism, and Haley's alternately muted and fearsome performance captures all of the inner turmoil and bizarre compulsions that drive him forward.  Malin Akerman seems to have been singled out for criticism in her role as the second Silk Spectre, which I don't find entirely fair--her work in some of the more dramatic scenes in the later going didn't make me forget Merryl Streep, but her character clearly wasn't intended to be the most heavyweight of the bunch, and she's at least adequate most of the time.  Besides, her near-total hotness and prominent presence in the aforementioned sex scene should more than mitigate any concerns about her acting chops.  The rest of the major players--Billy Crudup as the tenuously human genetic mutation Dr. Manhattan; Carla Gugino as the aging, jaded original Silk Spectre; Matthew Goode as the superhuman crime-fighter-turned-tycoon Ozymandias; Patrick Wilson as the nostalgic, relatively normal and well-adjusted Nite Owl--are all pretty competent, even if a few of them seem to have been picked at least in large part for their resemblance to the characters from the book.  And of course, Robert Wisden deserves special mention for his frighteningly believable performance as the neurotic, high-strung President Nixon.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of a few minor flaws, Watchmen still easily manages to emerge as one of the top Hollywood movies released this decade.  While there were certainly a few concerns going in--its prodigious length, its daunting source material, the spotty record of recent superhero films--I for one was glued to the screen from minute one.  Having seen the movie, Moore's refusal to have his name associated with the project now seems more like pettiness than principle.

0307269752|5.0|If I had to pick the best 2008 mystery book, I would vote for this one. When I got it, I knew nothing about the tragic fate of its author or even about the book's success in Europe. Somehow I missed all this rage. Nevertheless, I was spellbind from the first page and couldn't put the book down before I finished the last page.<br />The novel is about the financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist who is hired by financial magnate to investigate the 40-year old case of his missing niece. The girl with dragon tattoo is an extra-ordinary private investigator (\\"the best hacker in Sweden\\", as she admits), who also turns out to be in the middle of investigation.<br />I don't want to give any spoilers, so if you like well-written mysteries, \\"classically done\\", but happening in a modern world, this book would be perfect for you. True, it does begin a little bit slow for thrillers that we are used to, but isn't it the way it happens in real life?<br /><br />One warning: the second book in this trilogy is not getting out in US before July. You might be seriously tempted to order it from Amazon UK, where it was published in January. I am still not sure whether I'd be able to wait patiently for next three months.

Had to have it based on other's reviews!<br />If you like Joss Whedon, you'll love this fun, campy, musical. The story is cute-the \\"good\\" guy gets his in a satisfying way, and the end is a cool twist.<br />I didn't know Neil Patrick Harris could sing, this was a nice surprise. Nathan Fillion is always good entertainment. And Felicia Day was a lovely addition, making an all-around good show.

0375507256|5.0|A book that can easily be described as one of the novels of the decade, Cloud Atlas is both old-fashioned and cutting-edge at the same time. Any attempt to explain the interwoven stories is a spoiler all by itself and ruins a great deal of what the book has in store for the reader, so I encourage anyone curious about the book to avoid any synopses. Mitchell's imagination and skill are so impressive it is as if this book was written by someone with six lifetimes of experience, and six lifetimes are what this book is all about. Imaginative, political, and even a bit spiritual, Cloud Atlas is an unusual and challenging classic. It will appeal to those who love great, Nabokovian writing combined with hyper-stylized storytelling.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|I do like this album. Taylor shows her maturity in her writing but she cannot hide her age. She is also not that great of a singer and lacks range but where she is comfortable singing, she excels.<br /><br />This album can be thought of as a crossover due to its catchy tunes and light lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, a good album for fair weather country fans.
B0016OMFPW|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music. It should get 6 stars. I heard the track \\"Starmaker\\" on my cable jazz station and immediately fell in love with it and that was the first I had heard of this CD. I then went to Amazon and read all the reviews and decided there must be something to this. I just got the CD today and played it through and cant agree more with the previous reviews. There is something so elemental, seemingly effortless about the playing here, the close ensemble and complementary way the group interacts that projects the very essence of jazz, of music, period. I'll be playing this one for a long, long time.
0307454894|4.0|At first I was not excited to read The Reader since it had already been movie-ized.  When there is already a movie, it usually kills the book for me.  HOWEVER....not in this case.      The Reader as a book is first rate.  Schlink is a simple, clear, and highly effective writer.  What I enjoyed most about the book was the thought provoking nature of the characters and their relationship.  Certainly, the facts of Hanna's crime are horrific.  But her character, and relationship with Michael Berg and his with her left so many avenues of mental exploration open.  To me, the way Schlink sublimely accomplished this open-ended invitation to the nuances and angles of judgment was shear literary genius.      Regardless of a reader's ultimate opinions of Hanna and Michael, and what the story says about the German people's relationship to their Holocaust History, I count The Reader as a book I adored being bothered by.  (And for the record I thought Hanna was a ignorant sociopathic pedophile).

0312383320|3.0|I adore Stephanie Plum!  She's sassy, prone to trouble and I love that she doesn't have a foul mouth! Until this book! It's like I've grown up with this Stephanie, Lula, Morelli and Ranger.    I feel like someone ghost-wrote this book for Evanovich, or at least part of it was farmed out.  The tone of it just isn't right and it's down-right silly.  Morelli was just about missing-in-action, Ranger and her family (especially her pip of a grandmother!) were nearly non-existant. It's not that I didn't laugh at parts of it, but something was off.     I'm hoping the next book is much better.  I appreciate her body of work but the former zest needs to be revisited.

1582406723|5.0|I'd heard lots about this book, but only recently picked it up when I found it at my local library.    Man, am I glad I did! This is so much more than a rehashing of the classic and modern zombie movies. It's a tightly drawn story with excellent art and characterization that has yet to let me down (and I'm into vol. 5).    This series has legs! It can go on and on as long as Kirkman keeps doing what he's doing.    Kirkman is also well known for his work writing Marvel Zombies, but this is far and away its superior. Instead of the slapstick gore-fest in the Marvel book, which has its charms, Walking Dead has serious legs. I, for one, have always imagined what happens after the first outbreak in the typical zombie movies, and this goes the distance to tell that tale. I can't get enough.
0596522347|4.0|The author gives great content, practical how to do create a presentation and more. It did sadden me that the color wheel concept wasn't using the correct base colors. You cannot totally fault the author though because this is a common error. (Red, Green, Blue for screen... Cyan, Yellow, Magenta for print.) Now with that aside this book will expand your presentation abilities because it helps you see things from a number of different perspectives. This is good because your audience also is made up from many different perspectives. Now you might do a better job speaking to your audience and not just about your topic.

B000002UAO|5.0|Appearing at the end of 1965, Rubber Soul was a beautiful, gleaming revelation. After three years of continually expanding, ground-breaking pop/rock music, the Beatles had suddenly reached a position of unquestionable sophistication and maturity. From this moment on, no one could truly seriously question the group's talent, integrity or power to make good on what seemed the endless promise of their phenomenal mass success. Here was a masterpiece, beyond question, and it gave occasion for every loyalist to turn to the still-doubting holdouts and confidently say, \\"I told you so.\\"     Of course, virtually all of the Beatles' music up until this point was more than perfectly valid as an aesthetic/cultural expression of the highest order. Still, this was something different. The songs on Rubber Soul were more grown up, more refined and reached deeper into the heart of both what the lyrics expressed and the music implied. It was also their most beautiful-sounding record ever, with detailed textural nuances and subtle, yet exciting, arrangements. No group had ever sounded this good, this cohesive. Paul McCartney's extraordinary inventive, yet non-intrusive bass playing and Ringo Starr's tasteful, intelligent drum patterns laid a solid foundation for McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison to weave their most exquisite and heart-felt tapestries of song craft yet.     It's not as though this developed in a vacuum, however. The musical revolution that the Beatles had inaugurated had by now grown into a fertile, bubbling sea of creative activity. Most artists fell well short, but extraordinary efforts by the Rolling Stones, the Animals and the Kinks, for example - had kept plenty of pressure on the group to stay on top, or rather just ahead of the pack.     The one artist that challenged them, however, for complete artistic domination was Bob Dylan. The Beatles had known about Dylan since 1963, but as great a songwriter as the young man was, he posed no real threat to theBeatles' firmly established position as the biggest act on the planet. That was simply because Dylan was a folk singer, and the Beatles were rock. But in the course of 1965, the cocky American genius casually plugged in an electric guitar, and on two increasingly powerhouse albums, completely rewrote all the rules. Next to electric Dylan, the Beatles suddenly seemed to some to look old fashioned, quaint - perhaps even a little silly.     Ingeniously, and practically, the Beatles responded by pulling out the lyrical and attitudinal perspectives of Dylan's work just enough to apply it intelligently to their own unique style of music. The result - this album - was one of the great \\"fusions\\" in the history of music. The Beatles remained a pop/rock band - indeed, remained the Beatles - but with a new focus and clarity of vision that matured not only themselves, but their audience, literally overnight.     If the Beatles weren't capable of doing out-doing Dylan, the music on Rubber Soul was something that even Dylan couldn't touch - heart-rending, perfectly pop-crafted art that revealed the inner sentiments of their creators directly in a way to which their audience could understand and feel. It was a mind-blowing combination of technical perfection and vulnerable honesty that kicked up the stakes in mid-sixties rock yet another notch. And god, it sounded beautiful.     The same day that Rubber Soul came out, the Beatles also released a two-sided hit single. One can only imagine if the group had decided to jettison the two weakest songs on the album and replace them with \\"We Can Work It Out\\" and \\"Day Tripper,\\" just how much MORE impact it would have had. How much perfection can one handle, anyway?
0132350882|4.0|I really like reading uncle Bob stuff. Besides having great content, his style of writing is very easy to read.    While this book didn't have any huge \\"eye-openers\\" for me, it was great to read and served as a great reminder.     In my opinion, the criticisms of this book are a result of thinking about \\"how\\" instead of \\"what\\". Until an engineer can get over these thought habits, in my opinion, they do not fully comprehend OOP and are stuck in procedural coding methodologies.    I highly recommend this book to all levels of engineers, as even the most experienced can always use a reminder.

1427206031|5.0|This is the audiobook version of a fictionalized tale of the life story of George Mallory who died trying to be the first European to summit Mount Everest.    Roger Allam, the reader, has a good, clear voice with an English accent that isn't too strong for an American to understand, but adds to the atmosphere of time and place. The quality of the reader is an important consideration in the enjoyment of an audio book and Roger Allam has already performed that service in several of Archer's previous books. He is a good choice.    The story begins with Mallory's childhood and dramatizes a natural propensity towards climbing. His adventures and relationships through college and WWI up until the preparation for the big climb of his life seem to have a little bit of a sentimental treatment. I'm thinking of the old movies like Mickey Rooney's Edison, Don Ameche's Alexander Graham Bell, or Paul Muni's Louis Pasteur. To me, it had that kind of feel.     A larger portion of the novel is devoted to the preparation and climbs of Everest. Mallory made three attempts and no one is absolutely sure if he made it to the top or not on the last try in which (as everyone knows) he died. This is where Archer fictionalizes his ideas on what may have happened.     Archer is good at writing a story and Allam also succeeds in bringing this one to the audio format with an engaging style.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|Pasolini was very brave and a bit crazy to make SALO, an adaptation of an unadaptable novel, the Marquis de Sade's paean to depravity, THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM. De Sade's catalog of rape, sodomy, pedophilia, coprophagia (feces consumption), torture, and murder, is history's most pornographic novel, and Pasolini could not be too faithful to it without creating an unwatchable film, and perhaps even getting himself arrested. He couldn't go too far, but he went far enough. SALO is an unpleasant and at times sickening movie that requires a strong stomach to get through. The subject matter was so controversial that it was banned in several countries.    In de Sade's book, the setting was 17th century France. SALO takes place in Fascist Italy during WW2. The basic plot is the same, but 120 DAYS OF SODOM is separated into months (November through March) describing specific \\"passions\\", whereas SALO's activities are separated into \\"circles\\" much like Dante did in THE INFERNO. Four powerful and wealthy men, abduct a number of young men and women to serve as slaves, and recruit 4 prostitutes as storytellers. Locked away in a remote, heavily guarded palace, each prostitute tells stories of past experiences. These vile tales provide the stimuli for acts of debauchery, torture, and murder which are committed against those young slaves. This is extremely strong stuff..a lot of the torture mental as well as physical..and it is done quite artistically. This is not some cheap exploitation flick, but an artist's vision of moral bankruptcy and social corruption. Some of the scenes are reminiscent of the paintings of Old Masters. Pasolini seems to delight in hurling dung at a society that could allow a repulsive, repressive regime to flourish.    The cinematography and set designs of SALO are excellent, and the acting is particularly strong. Performances by many of the young actors are emotional and heartbreaking, and the acting done by the 4 villainous perpetrators is convincing in it's odiousness.    I would like to say that SALO is a must see movie, but I doubt many people could, or would sit through it. It is not for everyone for sure, but it is certainly a uniquely disturbing experience, with the emphasis for some on the word unique, and for others on the word disturbing. Nothing like SALO has ever been made, or will be made again.

0321544080|5.0|I purchased this book because I was fortunate enough to go on a photo shoot with Joe McNally at a PhotoShop World seminar. He gave many \\"common sense\\" techniques and tricks. I learned a lot that day and those tips have stuck with me. That's what makes Joe McNally such an awesome instructor and photographer. He's not afraid to give his secrets.  I read some of the negative reviews and all I can say to those reviewers: \\"photography is not like running a piece of machinery. It's technical, to be sure. But it's also a creative tool, and you must have a creative side to be a good photographer. There is no way you can learn how to shoot great photography by reading a book. You must be inspired to capture it the \\"Moment it Clicks.\\"   I have to add; it really helps to give a 5 star rating to a book when you find yourself in the book! That photo shoot I mentioned that I went on with Joe McNally, I'm there on the page (actually in both shots) titled \\"Da Premise.\\" Now how cool is that!!! Thanks Joe, I'm only at page 24, but I'm already loving each and every page. See you at a future PhotoShop World event.
1427206031|4.0|Paths of Glory (CD Version) contains 9 CDs with 11 hours of captivating narration.<br /><br />This is the story of George Mallory and how he came to climb Everest.  The question is did he \\"summit\\" or didn't he.  Since this is narrated like a fastastically written novel, it is hard to know what is fact and what is fiction in the story, especially if you know nothing of Mallory. The eplilogue, which sums up the lives of each character, is true but that is the only part of the story you can take on its word.  However, since the narrative is truly incredible and captivating I did not want to stop listening to it.<br /><br />Jeffrey Archer takes you through Mallory's entire life, wife, children, speaking engagment in America, two attempts at Everest, etc. but in the end you are still left with many questions.<br /><br />I think mountaineers and others who love good novels will enjoy listening to this. I believe a person of historical significance such as Mallory should not have any fictionalized tales told about him so this is the only reason I rated this four stars.

0810979772|5.0|Ok, I know this was mainly aimed for Kids but I'm a grown adult and I love this quirky DIY book. It's like a Diary/Journal Notebook + some fun questionnaires to fill out about yourself. I always write in my diary/journal in pencil so I can change answers later in the future. But I really love this book and might consider getting one for my 9 yr. niece. Having a diary/journal always helps ease your mind and unwind your emotions. I recommend this book ... totally !! The cartoons are funny as well. Opens up the creative side in your not just for Kids but Adults as well. Pick up a copy and start filling in the Blanks. =D
B001NE80P4|5.0|I received the \\"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\\" DVD very quickly, and it arrived well packaged and in perfect condition as promised.

B00110K62U|1.0|I have the original and this.  I couldn't wait for this to come out thinking it would be greatly improved with todays technology.  This is worse than the original DVD offered years ago.  I thought for sure the picture would be sharper and it isn't.  The sound is only acceptable.  Listening to Dolby 2.0 in 2009 is like listening to a worn out 8 Track tape vs. digital surround sound.  What's the point?  Not offering this in 5.1 in this day and age is ridiculous.  My daughter has Barney DVD's with better sound.  It seems the only goal here was to get it back on the market to make more money, not a better product.    Here is a suggestion.  If your local library has DVD's, go there and see if you can find the original and check it out.  You'll be glad you did and it's free.  Or worse case you can view this one if they have it without wasting your hard earned money.

0780631684|5.0|Final Destination is my absolute favourite ever movie. It has everything you could ever want from a horror movie: unique and likeable characters; brilliant plot twists; extremely inventive deaths (or \\"accidents\\"); loads of chilling suspence and enough gore to make the movie scary and fun but not enough to put you off or make you look away.<br /><br />Alex Browning has a horrific vison of the airplane, which he and his friends have just boarded on a school trip to Paris, exploding shortly after take off. He panicks after the vision and he, four other students and a teacher are forcible removed from the plane by the airline staff. The airplane takes off without them and a few seconds later, explodes just like in Alex's vision as it is ascending into the air.<br /><br />Thirty-nine days pass and everything seems fine, but then, after the funeral of the victims of the crash one of the survivors dies in a freak accident that is at first dismissed as suicide. But then the other survivors start dying in equally bizzare accidents and Alex and his friends learn that maybe they didn't cheat death after all as the grim reaper is stalkin them one-by-one...<br /><br />The movie has lots of suspence and just the right amount of gore. It is an absolute must see for any fans of the genre or anybody looking for a good movie.

0374139563|5.0|Excellent book.<br /><br />  About 30 years ago, a friend visiting China discarded some dirty clothes;  at his next destination, the items were washed, wrapped and waiting.  About 30 years ago, when I mailed t-shirts to Lusaka, Zambia, they were always stolen before reaching their destination.<br /><br /> If Moyo cannot understand this difference between China and Africa, then she cannot understand why a trillion dollars of aid has made no impact in Africa.  Zambia once built a plant to assemble Fiats;  everything except the air in the tyres was imported.  Likewise, every bicycle in the country, which is what 95 percent of the population uses, was imported because building a factory to make bicycles was so very lacking in prestige.<br /><br /> In other words, the fault rests with Africans and Zambians.  Until they recognize this, all aid will be wasted or looted.  In 1964, copper made Zambia one of the wealthiest societies in Africa;  today, it is scarcely better than Zimbabwe.  Why did President Kenneth Kuanda needed several fleets of Mercedes, each shutting down major thoroughfares when they roared forth from the presidential compound  - - -  just so folks would never know in which convoy he was hiding?  Ego, perhaps?  Instead of helping the people?<br /><br /> So what does this have to do with Moyo?  Her book helps understand basic social attitudes in Zambia and Africa  --  if foreign aid is stolen, it doesn't help anyone but the thief.  But, as Rwandan President Paul Kagame points out in the April 2009 issue of 'Fast Company' magazine, foreign aid is vital for economic progress.  The issue is the integrity with which it is used.<br /><br /> The problem is not in the stars, colonialists, foreign aid or Harvard graduates.  The problem is in the recipients.  After a century of humiliation, the Chinese are rising to greatness.  They use foreign investment, technology, knowledge plus their own work, integrity and sense of pride.  Perhaps China has the credibility to tell Africans, \\"We did it.  You can, too.  Here's how.\\"<br /><br /> Moyo's book succinctly explains the problem when aid is stolen or misused;  the essential question is whether macho African officials will listen to an intelligent woman and learn.  If not, her best advice is, \\"Don't waste your money . . . . .\\"<br /><br /> Moyo's education at Oxford, Harvard and Goldman Sachs are \\"foreign\\" to the learning of a traditional Zambian village.  But then, without such \\"foreign aid\\" combined with personal perception, would the egregious errors of donors who are blind to all but their own sense of righteousness ever be corrected?<br /><br /> Moyo whines;  President Kagame succeeds.  But even those who whine can contribute  . . .  if people listen.  Let's hope the powers-that-be listen to Moyo and then support the Kagames of Africa.t.  You can, too.  Here's how.\\"     Moyo's book succinctly explains the problem when aid is stolen or misused;  the essential question is whether macho African officials will listen to an intelligent woman and learn.

B0000AUHQT|5.0|Years ago, in the VHS days, I rented this movie and was extremely disappointed that all of the music had been altered. Indeed, best musical score and best costume design were the two Academy Awards given for this film. The music simply made the movie in my opinion.    Although there are no extras on this DVD, the visual quality is good, and I'm just glad that the dispute over the musical score was resolved. Nelson Riddle's musical masterpieces are back and a pleasure to listen to. I remember that the soundtrack was released back in the 1970's on 8-track tape. Now, if we could just get a CD of the soundtrack released, all would be well regarding this wonderful movie.
B0012EST60|1.0|The book is great, but this kindle version is very poor: bad lines breaks, no table of content, not even a cover image. Disappointing.
B000XYNFD2|5.0|OK, this is my third review for this watch, first, I gave it 1 star, and then I changed mind mind and give it three stars, but now, I will give it 5 stars rating.  Since I start to like this watch so much due to the accuracy of the movement.    Pro:  1) good value for a Swiss automatic movement with a saphire crystal watch.  2) The best accurate automatic watch so far that I've ever seen. This watch is running about +2 seconds/day in the first two weeks, but now it run within 1 second/day.  I was shocked to see an automatic movement that the accuracy is as same as quartz. While my Oris, Rado, Longines, Raymond Weil, Tissot are within +5 to +12 seconds/day  3) Oris has been using SW200 movement in their watches, so I guess the SW200 movement is not bad after all, it beats all of my watches with ETA movements in term of accuracy.  4) The watch band looks solid and durable.  Cons:  1) The detail and the finish of the watch are terrible. This is where Invicta needs to improve on most of their watches.  2) The Lugs stick out too far and rub against the watch band - bad design  3) The crown may pinch your wrist easily and make your wrist feels uncomfortable because of its sharp edge.  4) The bezel is a little bit difficult to turn, but It is not that bad    Overall, this is a good looking watch at a distance, but look closely, it is a little bit lousy and a poor quality made watch. I only paid $224 on worldofwatches when it was on special sale.  At first, I didn't like the finish of the watch, but the accuracy of the movement has changed my mind to give it a five stars rating.

006117758X|5.0|Defending Charles Bukowski's  rebellion against societal norms is a lost cause, and his abuse of alcohol, women, himself, and humanity in general have often gotten him slagged as a misogynistic wino with no karma left to burn. As a fictional memoir that covers the overlapping lives of Bukowski and anti-protagonist Hank Chinaski, Ham On Rye serves as a tome of both explanation and unorganized insurrection towards his detractors and, oddly enough, his own followers.    Most likely a play on Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, Bukowski's Chinaski goes through the same qualms as Salinger's Caulfield: hostility through sexuality (and vice-versa), a slap in the face of a torn nation (Bukowski and The Great Depression, Salinger and WWII), and alienation as a way of life. However, Salinger's (perhaps lack of) emphasis on personal growth is turned into Bukowski's emphasis on ignoring the reasons he/Chinaski grew up tough, mean, and odd. This could have easily ended up a stale story of a broken home and a broken country paralleling and splitting the life of what would become a broken boy, but Bukowski focuses on the scenes and people he was surrounded with. Were he real, Chinaski himself would probably ponder the effects of the distress around him, but in the end he would have concluded that he didn't care, and cracked another beer.     Plus, Chinaski's just a bigger bada** than Caulfield. Amidst the sad and awkward climb into adulthood, Chinaski encountered numerous situations where he bit down hard and threw a punch, whether or not he was going to win. He has rhino balls and elephant skin.    The book may be a quick read, but it's anything but a light read. Bukowski manages to be smart without being academic, offensive without being alienating, and able to write in a way that somehow lacks both the fluff and the stilted language/situations of minimalistic prose. His style has always taken a backseat to his tales, giving (good) directions, but never a reason to pick up a book andturn the pages. However, with Ham On Rye Bukowski is able to turn a well-lived life into a well-written story. Between this and his collections of letters, the world could someday understand Bukowski and world as he saw it, laughing from the barstool near the corned, feeling so badly the p***ing and s****ing glory of humanity.
B0000004V2|5.0|This album was a complete revelation when it arrived in 1989.  The Smiths were sadly gone, and British rock seemed to be in a bit of a holding pattern.  This shattering debut from Manchester completely changed all that in a single listen.    I still remember where I was when I first heard it in the summer of 1989.  After I picked up my jaw from the floor at the end of \\"Fool's Gold\\", popular demand insisted that the disc be put on \\"repeat\\" for the duration of a party that lasted until sunrise the next day.  It has never left my heart since that very memorable evening.    So many previous reviewers have caused me to nod in agreement with their heartfelt praise, so I won't do much more but encourage casual browsers to read those previous spot-on reviews.  Cliche or not, this is a desert-island, once-in-a-lifetime, truly indispensable record.    If I had one criticism, it would be that a remastering to bump up the bottom end would be welcome, as it's rather a bit trebly, and the Stone Roses rhythm section deserves to be fully audible.  Yes, the high end is crystalline and fully available to be enjoyed in all its detail, but the bass and drums could be a bit more up front.    Rumors are once again swirling of a summer tour reunion \\"before we're all fat and bald\\", but alas, only one possible US festival appearance is mentioned.  I say a long tour with a double-superbill of a reformed Smiths and Stone Roses alternating headline billing and joining each other to guest on select songs would be by far the most exciting ticket in memory.    This record is often put at the top of music magazine \\"best album ever\\" lists for good reason.  A list of those artists citing the Stone Roses as a significant influence would represent a mind-boggling number of album sales.  Buy this CD and understand.  Lather, listen, repeat.  You simply cannot be disappointed.
B0000019P9|5.0|This gem of a record is extremely successful from the instant the needle hits the vinyl until you have experienced flipping to both sides multiple times leaving on your knees begging for more, have mercy.  Highly recommended! A Must Have! YES!

B001M2IXEA|5.0|Purple or Zep?  In my book, Purple has Zep beat -- hands down!  I grew up on both, but to me, Blackmore was a more \\"complete\\" guitarist over Page.  Coverdale and Gillan were (and still are) vocal masters and had much more range than Plant.  Glover was not my fave Purple bassist but Glenn Hughes was (and still is) an accomplished bass player and vocal master (hence the nickname \\"Voice of Rock\\").  What can be said about Ian Paice on drums -- this guy played a small kit like it was HUGE!  Jon Lord on keys (since retired from touring) -- what a musician!  These guys continue to tour and keep pumping out albums -- true rock gods!

031606792X|2.0|Like so many others, I became entranced by the Twilight Saga. Every waking moment while reading the first three novels I daydreamed about them. I became obsessed with the intense love, the passion, the loss.  The tale of doomed star-crossed lovers.      Then I read Breaking Dawn and my heart broke. I knew what was going to happen by page 37 with the story of Tanya's mother. I thought NO this cannot be, she should not have a child. This is one of the sacrifices Bella should have had to make, she left that life behind when she chose Edward over Jacob and ignored Rosalie. Then the charade continues, Jacob imprinting on the mutant child, Bella becoming grander than any other vampire, and the avoidance of a battle with the Volturi. Where was the sacrifice? Where was the conflict? Where was the price?    Every decision made in life comes with sacrifices, comes with some loss, because you have chosen one thing over another. Yet, Bella loses nothing from her decision. She has a child, keeps her love Edward and her best friend, and does not lose her father. Bella needed to pay a price, face some kind of consequence for the decision she made, for immortality over life. A tale of such intense passion between two people who should not be together needs to end in some kind of sacrifice for the choice they made to be together. But, perhaps a price was paid.    A price was paid by millions of Twilight fans who expected so much more from this novel. Who read waiting to experience the pain that comes from a love so intense, yet it never comes. The plot is sacrificed and a central question from the books of whether vampires have lost their soul is never explicitly answered.  For myself, I take from the story that they do not. Yet, I pictured the ending of this story explicitly showing in some way that Edward had not lost his soul. I pictured the ending of this story to be tragic, yet no tragedy occurs except for the destruction of a great series. I know that some enjoyed the plotof this story, and while I cannot same the same for myself, I still cherish the first three novels and look forward to Midnight Sun. I just wish her tale had been one ending in tragedy like the tales Stephanie Myer paid homage to in her saga.
0143034901|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I have to say though, a book about a book? It doesnt sound interesting but it was an amazing story. A must read I would say! Also, Thank you Amazon, the book was delivered fast and I had no problems with my first experience with you guys! Keep up the good work!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Besides the few that really didn't like this series, I saw that so many loved it I had to get it. I already had Serenity and really enjoyed it, so I was expecting the best. I was not disappointed as it let me in on the lives of each of the characters. That was fun. BUT, if you have kids and were hoping this one would be fun to watch with them, you better go back to Bonanza. They pushed the envelope with the sexual stuff on a few of the episodes - and it was really not necessary except to try and be explicit as possible to get ratings. If it were not for these, I would have given it five stars. The people who said that the actors did a poor job must have missed that they were trying to be stiff, awkward folks when it comes to relating to others. That was part of the fun.
B000TETM7Y|5.0|this artist goes way beyond almost anyone out there with this album, in his mastery of voice, keyboard, songwriting, and in his ability to connect stylistically with the past while creating something entirely new and fresh.    i'm a hypercritical classical musician, so when someone gets my endorsement, i really mean it. along with lauryn hill's miseducation, brown sugar is pure genius, a timeless classic, essential listening.    i hope and pray that mr. archer gets everything he needs to live well and create more wonderful musc. i know there are so many who are eagerly waiting.
B00005V9IK|4.0|I have the DVD but hardly pull it off the shelf because it is almost perpetually on cable or regular TV (yuck). I watch it every time it is on unless something else over rides it, which isn't too often. The actors playing the array of characters are priceless...from Robert Loggia's ridicules ill fitting cap and triumphant speech \\"we got them beat Will, they are going down all over the world\\" and \\"tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down!\\" Now that's great writing and acting! Jeff Gouldblum--I love his quirkiness, delivery and hand gestures but he definitely tries to act way too cool walking with Will Smith after their alien ship crashes back on earth. The only unresolved question is how and where are they going to get rid of all of those city size space ships that were shot down? I really do love this move!

B000056H24|5.0|This movie is long, but worth every minute.  One of those movies you can sit down on a Saturday afternoon, order chicken wings and just sit back.  Pay attention to the opening credits and see names of actors and actresses; you will find yourself saying, \\"I didn't know he/she was acting back then.\\"  But one need not concern theirself with what character the 'old' actor was...the appearance may be too brief.  A great movie and worth the time and the purchase.

142720599X|4.0|Janet Evanovich's [[ASIN:142720599X Plum Spooky (A Between-the-Numbers Novel)]] is the latest of the between-the-numbers novels. Diesel makes his way back to Trenton and into Stephanie Plum's apartment hot on the heels of Wulf Grimoire, his cousin and all around scary creep who vanishes in a flash of light and can electrocute you with a simple touch of the skin. Stephanie is hoping to save the bail bonds business by capturing the elusive Martin Munch, a genius fallen into the wrong hands.<br /><br />From monkeys with metal helmets to a hippy animal activist named Gail Scanlon, Evanovich weaves a ridiculous tale that will capture readers and listeners' attentions right from the start. Diesel and Stephanie are forced into the Pine Barrens where there is no cell reception and where unmentionable creatures dwell, like the Jersey Devil, the Easter Bunny, Sasquatch, and Elmer the Fire Farter. While the plot is a bit out there, it will have you laughing and the book moves along quickly.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that the Pine Barrens is an actual location in New Jersey and that people do believe that it is the home of the Jersey Devil.

I was totally surprised by the author's description of his military leadership and tactical abilities.  The author does a superb job in detailing medieval combat.  Her description of the physical effort of combat and the realism of a battle's outcome on both the winners and losers is excellent.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B000ZN802W|4.0|This is a true story.  I attended the same university as this young man and the film almost broke my heart.  It is definitely worth seeing, but very sad.  Emory is full of some very smart and very privileged young men and women.  I think this boy confused rejecting consumerism with rejecting people in general.  He tries to make his life meaningful by turning his back on his family and materialism.  His search for meaning is tragic and very hurtful to his family because they really love him and never know what is happening with him.  I believe that the ultimate meaning in our lives can only be found through love and connection. His failure to really connect with self love and love for others is what ultimately killed him.  The film is beautiful and worthwhile to watch, but not lightweight or uplifting. [[ASIN:1604941987 Power Path to Love]]
