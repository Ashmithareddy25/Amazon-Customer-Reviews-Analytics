B00FRQ32N4|5.0|The graphics are much better than the last one, and there are eight new cool robots. One thing I didn't like was that there is a power core you have to wait for.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|SUPERB! Excellent casting,  expressive acting,  wonderful voices. This story finally makes sense of the wonderful world of Oz. Now,  the truth about the &#34;wicked&#34; witch can reach the masses.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Simple, creative and fun. It's been two days and I must have spent 10 hours playing this game. I am stuck on level 35 where I've to either pay up or wait a few days. Game is free to start but gives plenty of opportunities to spend money on boosters and getting past levels. There is social aspect as well but I am not big on Facebook and haven't tried that yet. Overall, love the simplicity and puzzle aspect of the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is seriously the most fun entertaining and challenging game ever! I give it 2 thumbs up and five stars!!
B0036G8IQS|4.0|I've already read the Kane chronicles, but this is my favorite yet, although Kane chronicles was  good  I found this book great
B001AQR3JY|3.0|This is  SUCH A GREAT MOVIE AND I LOVE THE SONGS but its so much cheaper in stores. Buying it on here is just dumb.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This charger provides a couple higher-powered ports for two devices, and allows us to charge an ipad and a phone at once.  The only thing I wish this charger had was better markings to identify which port is which.  They are marked, but with small print, and it's hard to see when it's plugged in.
B00ESF285S|5.0|Its an excellent book not only for kids but for anyone !! And a must read small book for all
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I had very high expectations for &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;.  &#34;The Shining&#34; was my favorite Stephen King novel.  For the most part &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; didn't let me down.  Without giving anything away, I can say that King's creativity remains strong.  His descriptive detail is formidable.  The story continues Danny Torrance's struggles with his gift/curse well into his forties and his effort to defeat a formidable foe, the True Knot.  We are also witness to Dan's struggles with alcoholism and his effort to defeat it.  King's emphasis on this is a major part of the book.  King's own struggles with alcoholism are well known, and &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; provides King a platform to tell us how important AA was in his own addiction.  Hang on to your hat (let's hope it isn't a cocked top hat) and sign up for the ride.  My only real problem had to do with the ending, but that I won't discuss until everyone else has read &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited to get the game because so many of my friends were playing. After playing the first day I became addicted. I like this game a lot. I will recommend it to friends. Very addictive.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|not what i expected it from this actor, i would not recommend this movie will bored you to death, unless you are a very religious person.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great thinking game.  Figuring out clues to get the doors opened. I really enjoyed it. Hope more levels follow.  Would purchase.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|It's a novel idea. It weaves what we already know with the context by which what remains unknown can be understood.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A good searching game. Have to find stuff you need. Like screwdrivers for the screws on the vent, a key to the safe...etc.... you actually have to think with this I one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a really relaxing and challenging game at the same but I really love it cause it relieves some of my stress when I need it.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I bought it because my kindle won't let me on the Internet. So I got it and it won't let me search anything. It just goes to the main screen, just like before.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King is back—and how! Granted, he hasn’t quite ever really been “gone”, never really “lost it” (as many recent successes can of course attest to), but, still... something about his modern-era novels just never quite “shone” like some of his earlier ones… a certain *something* that is hard to put a finger on.<br /><br />With this book, though, there’s no question of its power or pedigree, and no question of just how uniquely crazy and twisted King’s mind still is, and just how much more untapped creative juice still bubbles within. This is the Stephen King we all grew up on, the Stephen King whose novels we couldn’t put down, whose writing style had us cringing one moment and laughing the very next, whose story’s pace would only get faster and faster until it all comes to a frenzied, spectacular head. This is Stephen King in his heyday. He is “back”—and in full form. As I was reading this story (in a mere two or three sittings, because I couldn’t put it down), I seriously kept thinking to myself just how this story gives me that nostalgic feeling, as though I were back in time, reading one of his vintage classics again!<br /><br />I only hope this visit is one he takes us many more times in years to come because, after “glimpses&#34; here and there over the last decade or two of that Stephen King of old, it’s good to finally get hit hard with a “full blast”, as we are with this amazing, gripping, masterful novel!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the wrap up to Dan (tony doc) Torrance. Now I will need to see where niece takes uncles legacy. Paying attention ther Mr. King?
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|Good challenge in every episode. It is nice the use of logic an strategy. I like the interface and graphics.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think that the 2014 version of deer Hunter is the best do far. The new action and exclusive hunts are amazing
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Pacific Rim is a great popcorn flick and a blast at the movies.  Watching this film gave me feelings of nostalgia of sorts.  This movie was like a mecha anime and a Godzilla film meshed together, and it is awesome.  Since I am a fan of both anime and Godzilla I was really looking forward to this film, and it did not disappoint.  If you are looking for a complex and deep film this is not for you.  If you are looking for a great time at the movies definitely give this a look.  I like that this is something original rather than a sequel, remake, or an adaption of something like Hollywood likes to do these days.  I really hope that this film does well so that studios will be compelled to take more risks again.<br /><br />The story is quite simple and strait forward.  A portal to another dimension appears and the bottom of the Pacific Ocean which is called the Bridge.  Giant monsters rise up through the portal and start wreaking havoc in our world.  In response we build giant robots called Jaegers to fight them.  The movie gives us a brief synopsis and drops us in the middle of the war so we can get right to the action, which I think is a good move.  The story is simple, but sometimes simple is the way to go.  This is one of those times.<br /><br />The characters are fine.  You are not going to this film for complex characters, but the characters are enjoyable for the most part and get the job done.  The main character, Becket (Charlie Hunnam) is a bit bland but I liked him.  I like that he has been a pilot before and knows the ropes and is not a rookie.  Usually in these types of films the main character is a rookie that needs to learn the ropes and becomes strong at the end.  However, Becket is highly skilled, is a great pilot, and is not cocky or overly obnoxious, which I highly appreciate.<br /><br />They did the rookie thing with the other main character, Mako (Rinko Kikuchi).  She is a rookie in that she has never piloted a real jaeger before.  However, she has been affiliated with the organization for a long time and learns how to pilot a jaeger very quickly.  She is also very skilled in regular combat as well.  Plus, like Becket, she is not overly cocky.  Usually the female characters like her are extremely cocky where it is annoying.  She kind of is at the beginning but not too much.  She also has an interesting backstory as well.  I ended up really liking her too.<br /><br />Then there is Stacker Pentecost played by Idris Elba.  He is my favorite character in the movie.  First of all Idris Elba is an amazing actor.  In every movie I have seen him in he gives a great performance.  This is probably my favorite performance of his which is saying a lot.  He has a very commanding voice.  He also has a great presence to him.  The speech he gives at the end of the film is epic.<br /><br />The side characters are hit or miss for me.  The two scientists in the film I did not care for.  I thought they were too over-the-top even for a film like this.  I like the appearance by Ron Perlman, though I wish that had more to do.  The Max Martini’s character Herc I did not like at all.  He was a giant ass in the beginning and it was really irritating.  They tried to make him more likable later but it did not work for me.<br /><br />The best aspect of the film by leaps and bounds is the action.  The action was phenomenal.  The effects were outstanding.  I cannot comment on the 3D aspect since I did not see it in 3D.  The action really sucks you in and gives your adrenaline pumping.  The action scenes are on par with the ones in Man of Steel in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, Pacific Rim is a great summer movie and should definitely be seen.  This film is not for everyone.  This film mostly aims at guys.  However, some girls will probably enjoy it too.  If you want a fun action movie definitely check it out.  I really hope that this film does well.
0385351399|4.0|In this super creepy story, a Google-like company completely brainwashes young, affirmation-needy social media users in the beliefs that information should be freely accessible to all, to learn or experience anything and not share it is stealing from humanity, and therefore \\"privacy is theft.\\" Presented are compelling arguments about why all secrets are lies and why total transparency is required for a more civilized world. Sure to be made into a movie. The Right to Privacy? Spinned around to become the Right to Knowledge. I'm only dinging one star because details are glossed over, there is too much use of unnecessary foul language, and it's too predictable. But it's frighteningly believable that people could be stupid enough to accept benevolent totalitarianism when presented this way. I know young people like Mae.
B0001CTKE4|5.0|I'd say it's been more than a decade since I'd listened to this, and it was a pleasure.  Especially &#34;Blow Away&#34; was good to hear again.  Interesting to compare this re-recorded version of &#34;Not Guilty&#34; after finally hearing the original version, which appeared on The Beatles Anthology series.
1401938906|5.0|I have always been spiritual and believed that the universe has untold treasures to make our lives amazing - but there has always been the tinsiest bit of doubt, in the farthest corners of my mind!<br /><br />Not any more!<br /><br />Excellent book no matter if your just starting your spiritual awakening journey or have been up there with the best for decades - this book and its experiments is profound and special.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I am loving this series. Anyone who wants adventure, and surprises, and history, will love this story. It is a lot of fun.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|dislike how you have to pay or wait after playing for awhile - very frustrating- it is fun though until it stops you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad I can get on the kindle have been playing for a long and glad I can play it on all my devices
B000SEIK2S|4.0|This is a fascinating story of rejuvenation after reaching 75 years of age, but it is a shame the added years have to be spent fighting and utterly destroying other beings.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|This album has all the best elements of Backspacer with a bit of Yield and Vitalogy (minus the weird fillers) thrown in. It is definitely the most consistently enjoyable album since Yield too. The middle with Lightning Bolt, Infallible and Pendulum are the highlights. I also absolutely love Let the Records Play! It's not going to win over any new fans but those who have stuck with the band (even through the rather uninspiring Riot Act and the so-so Binaural) will be rewarded with an album of instantly likeable songs. I was hooked from the first listen.<br /><br />I think that releasing the punkish Mind Your Manners as the first single was a mistake because it is the only one of its kind here and does not represent the tone of the album as a whole (great song though.) Sort of like what Foo Fighters did with White Limo only to find there was nothing else on Wasting Light that even resembled it either.<br /><br />What we have here is a mid tempo affair that gets more mellow as the album progresses. I personally believe Pearl Jam have always been at their best with their mid tempo and brooding epics, see - Corduroy, In Hiding, Release, Present tense, Better Man, Amongst the Waves, In My Tree, Given To Fly, Black, You Are, Off He Goes, I Am Mine, Indifference, Unthought Known, Breath, Nothing Man, Inside Job, Immortality, Insignificance... the list goes on.......<br /><br />4 stars of brilliance for mine! :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is well written for young adults and adults. Enjoyed the parallels in the storytelling between the main story and the two main characters favorite books.
0786869143|5.0|Luck, a very subjective random effect seems to be all the opposite to Science and to scientific theory. Nevertheless the author manages to show that science may find a way to explain luck and even to reproduce it. I had a remarkable experience with the Toki-Moai. It worked and changed my life even if it seemed to be purely mysticism. It was only years after that I found that the Toki-Moai effect was studied and scientifically proven by scientific studies at the University of the Ryukyus. What the author talks about is very recognizable to me and most surely shows that Luck is a perhaps random but observed effect and all that can be observed can be submitted to scientific scrutiny. It also shows that even luck may be not controlled but incited in some way. A good book and an excellent work.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is sooooo addicting<br />And funny<br />I like that your a minion trying to do these objectives<br />I really like it it's very very addicting
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I've seen quite a few movies about Liberace but this one didn't pull any punches. It portrayed the man not the fantasy that was his public persona. Michael Douglas was incredible (I didn't think he had it in him!) and Matt Damon as the young lover was totally believeable. I highly recommend this movie.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|idk why but I only have 2 apps but the game wont install? to much space? I played it on my friends device but this is rediculus.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|My &#34;Once&#34; CD arrived on time and in great condition.  It was a birthday gift to my wife and she loved it. The CD exceeded my expectations for a used CD.  I will purchase again with no doubt.  I highly recommend to everyone.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Jazz, blues, and rock-and-roll - it doesn't get much better than that. I was never a Rolling Stones fan but this opened my eyes to the raw talent they actually have. The respect they show for Muddy Waters is palpable and Muddy's enjoyment of them brought tears to my eyes. What's even more marvelous is that none of it was planned and that is very obvious from the reactions of the performers and the audience. Muddy Waters' performance was being filmed and the Stones just came in to the Lounge to see him - seredipity at its finest.
B005BOHYW2|5.0|This book was phenomenal, I enjoyed every page from start to finish. The structure was fantastic; the themes were relevant and I even learnt a bit more about the language of flowers.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it and it is certainly worth it's five stars.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|I love the first harry ⚡️potter. It made me feel that much more excited to be on holiday in London for the first time.
B000JZ68GG|1.0|What can I say this stars Hanoi Jane and as a veteran I will never forget her act of treason. This woman should have been jailed or shot for the traitor she is. Instead we set her free to collect royalties on her movies, oh by the way she sucks as an actor. I for one will never watch anything movie or show that she appears in.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Probably the only holdover from the grunge era that are still making music actively, Pearl Jam just keeps churning out great albums.  Their days of having radio hits are long gone, but this album rates up there with the best of them.
B001CD6MA6|5.0|This came with extra's and my son loves to replay the extra's over and over. This was a great buy.
0753827662|4.0|I enjoyed (mostly)  reading Gone Girl, especially since filming of the movie has been going on in Cape Girardeau for several weeks now.  What do I NOT like about the book...the very liberal use of the F-word.  I would have enjoyed it much more had I not been assaulted with it coming from so many of the characters.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|It was fine until my spyware found a Trojan attached to it. Please fix it because I really loved the game.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Always Elvis. Amazing CD's that offer insight into his music. His voice was at it's peak. So many great recordings were made at Stax.
0316322407|5.0|i normally do not write reviews for books. i normally dont even read biographical books. but this is a must read...meaning, you must purchase a copy of the book for yourself, your family, your friends, and your coworkers. hell, even toss one at a complete stranger. as malala recounts her childhood, experiences, and injustices, your point of view on the world will change drastically. i feel as if if malala's spirit can be found in any one of us...we just havent found how to extract it yet, and make the difference.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Always great and just as great watching on my KindleHD Thank you very much I appreciate it so much. Yay
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Outview , is truly one of the new age Spiritual Fantasy books on the market now for our younger readers, and it is by far  one of he better ones. I could not put this one down!  Oh the drama! You ain't seen nothing yet! Young teen Nathan Ryder has lost his father, his brother has been locked up in a mental institution by his mother and a secret government agency is after him. Then he discovers he has mystical gifts that the family has been hiding. He quickly is engulfed into a strange new world- one of great paranormal intrigue.He finds out just how powerful he really is and meets some of the most interesting and enlightened characters who help him on his spiritual quest to unlock a very dark secret.Imagine actually meeting a `mystic'!<br /><br />I was so impressed at the level of knowledge Brandt Legg  possessed on the spiritual side as was quite evident in his writing. This story has piqued my interest to go on and research some of the places mentioned in the story. Ad a children's reading specialist I see this is a top pick for middle grades through young adult or anyone. I am hooked and can't wait to read the rest in the series.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I really enjoy this live version of his songs, and I love the female vocals on it as well.  There's a lot of good music here, and his comments between songs will make you laugh
B005KELWJY|5.0|Just to be up front, I found this cheaper elsewhere, but since I do so much shopping on Amazon, thought I'd put in my 2 cents worth here. It is for my Paperwhite.<br /><br />One thing in my research I noticed is that some of the covers can be a little thicker and heavier, not this one. It is going to do the job of protecting you Kindle Paperwhite while not causing undue hand fatigue. When I'm laying in bed and am holding it upright and holding it in a L finger position, the edges (when the cover is folded back and magnet latch engaged) gives me nice finger support.  The leather on the corner straps are nice accents, and firmly hold the Kindle in place. It really is a very nice basic functional cover.<br /><br />I'm putting this on my Wish List, just so I don't forget this model for future reference.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm not usually one for games but I adore this one! It is more addictive than I thought! I completely understand why all of my friends love this game!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I can not wait to see how this ends.  The first two books are really good.  Now on to the third and final book!!
B007EC27QM|3.0|This is a good choice for ease of use with the simple interface and large type. It will suit your needs for a basic calculator if you need larger keys and type. MobiCalc+  is still my first choice for calculating. I've tried many different styles.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Would like to see more of a goal for the game or you could make it into a tower defense  game. Nice mini games that are semi  difficult.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works well. Easy to start up and get going. Wish a few more programs feed into it, but I am sure they are coming down the road.
1568363931|5.0|Tried some of the recipes and they were great. Most are quick, simple meals make each meal a special surprise. Fun new concept for lunch.
B00DJWV11I|3.0|This was a lighthearted, simple, sweet and most definitely funny read!! It was interesting having the whole book from the male POV and I really enjoyed this aspect.<br /><br />Read this is one day and really enjoyed the easiness of it!
B0000041Q3|5.0|Received in perfect condition in a timely manner.  Sutherland and Pavarotti were excellent.<br />If you love Pavarotti you will love this.  Their singing is magnificent and never sounded better.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and loved it. This sequel is every bit as satisfying. I love the combination of historical accuracy mixed with the fictional story. I could keep reading more about this family at any generation.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Great return from Pearl Jam, as soon as I heard Manners on the radio I was flooded with wonderful memories from this great band and happy to know they are still as great as they ever were and didn't lose their sound to processed radio garbage like so many bands.  Hail Pearl Jam and well done!!!  Can't wait for their next release!  Solid Pearl Jam rock album, no BS.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love candy crush even though I don't get addicted and pay out every single day I do enjoy playing it
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|This book is better than the movie, although it was a good film. The characters have more depth in the book and there are times you really don't think well of Rachel and her attitude with Darcy. However, the ending is definitely satisfying.
B002T921AC|2.0|I had a request for this for a children's function.  I would never buy it for myself to support this over-indulged, spoiled brat entertainer.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|****SPOILERS****<br /><br />Can we say convolution? Holy cow what a smorgasbord of craziness. She introduced more drama in this book than should have been covered in an entire series. None of it really relating to anything specific to carry the story. I have whiplash.<br /><br />They can't be together because it could be misconstrued to the authorities and flag him as a suspect in her step brothers murder-- ok, I get that. But it was breezed over quickly and then the whole conflict was resolved very anticlimactically. Her mother and father? Really? That was about as unnecessary and frankly disturbing as you can get. The whole Corrine situation is a joke. Then there is the Cary/baby thing. WTH? When she threw in that morsel I nearly threw out my kindle.<br /><br />I was vying for them during the second book when I was able to somewhat break apart from the Fifty Shades shell. But this one-- whoa. I found that I adore Gideon and began despising Eva. His character is steady and unwavering and she bounced around more than a flipping washing machine. I found that I could totally skip this book in this series and really miss nothing pivotal. The ending was, of course a cliff-hanger and we now have a fourth title coming up in a TRILOGY.<br /><br />Not sure I'll waste my time in reading but honestly I probably will. Only because I like closure when I commit to a story line and the characters, something she needs to remember as an author.
B00957T6X6|5.0|A Game if Thrones all the way through Dance with Dragons is a wonderful, haunting, thrilling, and addictive story that you cannot seem to put down once you've started! G.R.R. Martin brings the characters to life in such detail you find yourself lost in the visions of snow, monsters, giants and dragons as if they were right before your eyes! Joffrey and the Lannisters; along with the others, the ones you live to hate, then on to Dany with her dragons and the boy Aegon, both trying to reclaim their throne as they wind their way back to their kingdom..cannot WAIT to see where the next book in the series of this story takes its characters.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is so awesome it's free and 3d it's so decked out and it is so awesome  I love it and I can't wait till the jetpack is out I'm currently the tiger shark so what is the stone it's the megoladon! So what are you waiting for download it now now now now!
B00ELE8D4Q|4.0|Regarding Cher the only artist in history to have number one hits for 6 decades, I can only rave and applaud.  The digital copy wasn't showing after I bought this but I called customer service and they resolved that issue fast.  The CD was shipped fast too, but as I said above, the case arrived damaged, but not to the point I'd return it.  Not sure why one song sounds distorted and over driven and I am assuming it was the master and not the individual CD, but they're mass produced so it could be.  So many great songs and such a wonderful artist that I hate to complain or score it low because it's not Cher's fault.
B0035LJZ1Q|4.0|This was interesting and would be a great movie to watch on Halloween .  Recommended for anyone who likes Johnny Depp , or Irving's classic tale.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|What a fascinating tour of a young woman's soul as she embarks on establishing a career for herself in Her Majesty's Secret Service.<br /><br />Why? As a male of the species, I was curious as to how the author researched his heroine and inhabited the thoughts, feelings and actions of a smart-enough, pretty Cambridge graduate searching for a life. I have asked my Wife, Sister and Sister in Law to this novel, not only because I enjoyed it so thoroughly, but because I need their validation that our protagonists' experience seemed legitimate in terms of words and deeds.<br /><br />Also, I spent a little time in London during the early 70's in which this novel is set (I'm an American) and was taken back to a time that I clearly misremember as I was  blissfully unaware of the political backdrop affecting the UK.<br /><br />Read it. You'll like it...
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For some reason my Sony Smart TV was missing the Hulu Plus app widget and the outsourced Sony support people were no help at all, and one told me that it was due to my location, however a Hulu support person said your IP address shows USA to us and if it works on your Laptop it should work on your TV so contact Sony again as we can't help you resolve this issue on our end, but they did credit me a month for the trouble I was encountering.  After many attempts I gave up on Sony and bought this and now I can mirror Hulu from either phone or my laptop.  There are some things that won't broadcast yet and it shows it's not supported, but they said they're working on adding more soon.  You do have to use a Chrome browser to use it with the computer, which isn't an issue for me since I had it installed already, but it would be nice if that wasn't a requirement, but it's less expensive than a Roku device and it works for what I was trying to resolve, although there have been a few buffering problems on occasion, so I'm overall satisfied and I would recommend it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Somewhat Harry Potter like, this tale is dark and mysterious and kept me craving more. Interested to see what happens in the next story. And the pictures are really creepy!
076781326X|3.0|It has half of the movie on one side of the disk and the other half on the movie on the other side so you have to flip the disk halfway through the movie.  That made the watching experience kind of annoying.  Other than that, the movie itself was great and the quality was good.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are by far the nicest utensil set I've ever seen, or had.  These are the perfect sizes, every tool is a necessity, and the colors bright and cheery.  Great quality, and know they'll last for many years.  They're a great buy, and you won't be disappointed.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A history book about a founding father just does not get any better than this.  David McCullough wrote this book and spent years doing it.  Paul Giamatti narrated the audio version and did a great job.  I recommend the audio version to make that drive cross country much more enjoyable and educational.
6304806434|2.0|there were 3 or 4 glitches at the end of the video at some of the more exciting scenes.  It didn't stop completely so it was viewable but it really distracted from the whole mood set up to that point in the film.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am an avid  SK reader and I have to say that Dr. Sleep just became one of my favorites! It was interesting to see how Danny Torrence grew up and how his childhood and the Overlook hotel tied into his adult life and the crazy twists and turns that surrounded it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is good to get a quick look at weather and hourly breakdown for someone who walks regularly.  Sometimes quite off on the temps.  Overall good app.
B002H0DX96|5.0|I have really liked this movie since it was released. Now I have a 12 year old grandson who loves baseball.  He has played Little League since he was six years old.  He keeps up with all the stats and players in the MLB which he hopes to be a part of someday.  I rented this movie on Amazon for him to watch.  He thought it was one of the best movies he has ever seen.  I would recommend this movie to any parent who has a child or grandchild who loves sports.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book! Immediately drawn into a beautiful story.<br />Well written and full of emotion. Highly recommend! Now to find another good one!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|This book contains many rich insights into that part of human nature which is mirrored in being introverted or extroverted.<br />I thought I already had a pretty clear understanding of the topic, but I know realize how superficial that understanding was.<br />Recommended to anyone!
B00F91H666|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was entertaining and smartly written.  Great acting as well.  It made me wish to go out and bite people!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I was a teenager, I picked up the Shining for the first time. Twenty years and half a dozen rereads later, I was glad to meet the full grown version of Dan Torrance.  Doctor Sleep is a gripping and moving story that will be on my list of books to read and reread for years to come.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been playing on my android and really wanted it on my kindle. Am so happy to finally be able to!!!!!<br />Love this game---but I must warn you, it is so-o-o-o addictive!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it! a little disapointed that I cant sync it with facebook from My kindle though; all the stuff ive earned on my iphone cant update on the kindle without it. but awesome game. cute and entertaining.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Keeps my interest and entertaining.  Glad I started and finished season 1, now on to season 2.  highly recommend the show
0375812024|5.0|My kids enjoyed this book we are planning our first airplane trip so it has helped in explaining different areas of the airport and what to expect.  Overall a fun family read.
B000GWE44U|5.0|This movie is amazing all around! The story is intriguing, the music builds suspense to a boiling point, and Kubrik's cinematography keeps you wondering what's around every corner! Nicholson's performance, as to be expected, is fantastic.  Danny Lloyd is incredible as well as the son.  The only blemish on this film is Shelly Duvall's performance, she is unconvincing at times, and over the top at others (and watch how she runs with the knife... who would flail like that?)<br /><br />Overall, this is an absolutely amazing, must see movie for an older audience. Perfect for Halloween, obviously!
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I found this latest edition to the \\"Iron Man\\" series to be lacking in depth and story line. The action scenes were good but not great.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is fun technology<br />It's fun to be able to send movies from my tablet or phone directly to my TV
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Obviously it is one of the most talked about games to ever land on mobile. If you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for? I have the candy crush sickness!

B00BJO5SXK|5.0|Tyler, The Creator, the 22 year old rapper, producer, music video director, graphic artist, television actor, entrepreneur & Founder/CEO of Odd Future(OFWGKTA). Now with such an impressive resume of achievements for the young MC, Tyler is also infamous for his outlandish activities in and outside of his music. Tyler is no stranger to controversy and often criticized for his brash behavior. Among his many controversial outbursts, internally Tyler is a regular person who doesn't quite understand the world well enough yet. Tyler is essentially a child who (like many other teenagers and young adults) deal with insecurities and doubts on a daily basis whether or not they choose to tackle it head on or keep it bundled inside. What makes Tyler, The Creator's music different from the rest of his colleagues his age in the Hip Hop world is the fact that he chooses to say and do whatever he pleases no matter how unorthodox his music can be at times. With his previous 2 albums (Bastard & Goblin) gaining moderate attention and success, what Tyler has failed musically with his past 2 projects have now been explored more with his 3rd album WOLF. Now Tyler, The Creator's music have always been associated with misogynistic, satanic, vulgar lyrics (similar to Eminem back in the day). Whats different with Tyler the third time around is that he has pulled back on the profanity (just a smidge) to let listeners and his fans into his state of mind past, present and future.<br /><br />WOLF essentially is an introspective album and arguably Tyler's best album to date. Of course Tyler isn't without his antics and rowdy ignorant cuts such as \\"Trash Wang\\", \\"Tamale\\", \\"Jamba feat. Hodgy Beats\\" & \\"Domo 23\\" which are all there for entertainment and balance. Tyler (like most boys) experiences girl troubles and a good majority of the album are about women negative or positive. Songs like \\"Awkward\\" tells a story of a boy in an awkward young relationship with a girl whos relationship progresses but quickly descends thanks to awkward teeny-bopper insecurities. \\"IFHY\\" is an a abbreviation for (I F***** Hate You) which again is also about  girl but in a love/hate relationship which I'm sure many people can relate to. And the 3-part song \\"PartyIsntOver/Campfire/Bimmer\\" is a 7 minute song with different beats about girls once again, which each segment coming from a different angle with the last song, Bimmer, being my overall favorite song production wise along with \\"48\\" also featuring fellow OF crooner Frank Ocean.  The song \\"Rusty\\" features OF cohorts Domo Genesis and the very talented Earl Sweatshirt showing off each one of the MC's lyrical ability as well as Tyler getting some stuff off his chest.<br /><br />Once you get passed all the fun songs and all the girl-themed songs, there are plenty of gems on the album with great storytelling. My absolute favorite song on the album would have to be \\"Answer\\". This song is the first time I really felt sincerity in Tyler's voice, most of the song covers his relationship with his estranged father, but has Tyler venting about him deeply yearning to form some type of connection with his long lost dad. Production wise, Answer is Tyler's most impressive. \\"Colossus\\" is also storytelling but this time Tyler expressing his annoyance with his new found fame. This song reminded me a lot of Eminems \\"Stan\\" where we have Tyler rapping from both his personal perspective as well as from his fans.  The song \\"Lone\\" closes off the album very nicely with a very classy jazz production; here we have Tyler, The Creator summarizing his growing disinterest in his fame and also touches on the death of his grandmother.<br /><br />Theres only a few gripes that I have with WOLF, although not as many as I had with Goblin. Some people may complain about how stale Tyler's production can be, and admittedly I have to agree with that statement. Tyler has a distinct production style using a lot of synthesizers, distinct piano loops and simple drum patterns.However, although I don't think any of the beats on this album are innovative, all of these beats go hand in hand with Tyler's style and flow. The only songs that don't fully connect with me are \\"Pigs\\", \\"Slater\\" and \\"Treehome95\\" (although having Erykah Badu on an album like this is pretty impressive). WOLF is not a perfect album, nor will it ever make a big impact in the Hip Hop world. But for Tyler, this album is a great accomplishment showing his growth as a producer, a rapper and a songwriter. Tyler, The Creator as an artist is hard to understand at times, and for a 22 year old, he is quite complicated, but at least with WOLF we get a couple more glimpses into who Tyler, the \\"Person\\" really is.<br /><br />Favorite 5<br />1) Answer<br />2) Rusty feat.

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I liked this game went back and did levels again to get 3 stars on them. Each level is cute and looks good.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book is not only well written but in my opinion, just a wonderful love Story. The author has marvelous sense of Humor.
B007EC27QM|5.0|LOVE IT, Would Highly recommend Great job developers. This is a great app.  WORKS, LOOKS, FEELS like a Desk CALCULATOR
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Anker as a company personally I've never heard of them. so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this mouse. i did a little bit of research and to my knowledge this mouse was pretty reputable. so i ordered it and it came shipped fine and in a timely manner, actually came like 3 days ahead of time so i was pretty excited. It comes with a couple of weights you can load in the rear of the mouse to make it a bit more heavy, im currently using only 4 of the weights which i feel is plenty. the mouse has a good feel to it, its for the palm gamers. i personally have big hands so i can rest my hand easy on this mouse. the side buttons are a bit sensitive but not in the way. i never accidentally hit them or anything. it comes with some software to where you can tweak the mouse settings its very user friendly and useful. i give this mouse 5 stars. its a underdog company in the mouse world but they triumph any other gaming mouse at this price for sure.
0446585041|5.0|loved it! it a different kind of book  its very very positive  and i recommended it  its funny too  love it
B008ROG6E0|4.0|I watched this movie as a young teenager, and just watched it again in my forties and still love it!!!
B001JNNDDI|5.0|this movie is amazing to watch, its funny and sad at the same time. it will be great to watch it whenever you want to
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I thought it was a pretty funny book. Plus it was a very relatable story. I would recommend this book.
6305161879|5.0|The DVD was received when it was expected, right on time. The movie was in excellent condition and perfect for a group viewing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I just loved this book, such great storytelling! I could really feel what they were feeling. Glad I found this book, can't go wrong.
B00000JR2A|3.0|Had this one on a cassette and I had to have it on CD. The Seeds of  Love sound like the Beatles which appealed to me. Woman in Chains is great as well as the bonus tracks.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Another triumph for Lee Child.  The story was fast paced and detailed.  I found myself reading faster and faster, waiting for Reacher to do his thing and I was not disappointed.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is fun. The only issue I have is that you have to pay to get the best funds there is no free option.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was very well written, and very fascinating but I think it was to mature for a teenager. She's a great author and I'll be looking for more of her books.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game so much its like everytime I see or get on my tablet I go striaght to this game I love it so much....
B003UBTX7C|3.0|This one is sort of a disappointment and I'm afraid Baldacci might have worked this character and this theme to death.  Let it just go away without killing anyone off.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This Book had be hooked from the very first sentence! I couldn't put it down until I finished the whole book, plus the first few chapters of the second book!! Its a must read!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|the game is cool... it sucks that you have to pay if you really want to move ahead.<br />It's cool. Game is very addicting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once you get through the first one, you are hooked.  The movie version is a disappointment, in my opinion. Read the books!  You'll be glad you did.
B00A2H9WW8|5.0|Remake or re-imagining? I'd almost whole heartedly say re-imagining. Though at times you can still feel the essence of the 1976 film, it still feels new and revamped. However, this adaptation stays relatively close to the source material while staying modern at the same time. I understand homage - it's fine and all but it feels to be consistent at times. Yes, De Palma's film is classic but it shouldn't be the back bone of this film which at times it feels like it is. The homage's in this film I believe is kind of a mistake. Sometimes there is a little bit of a rinse and repeat cycle in this film as if this would be an actual remake. But those little complaints do not mean anything to the other great things in this film.<br /><br />  The acting is pretty superb. Julianne Moore nails it as Margaret White. She really understands and captures the psychology of Margaret. Chloë Grace Moretz... She's outstanding as Carrie. I definitely see an Oscar nomination in her future. Most likely not for this film but any character she portrays like this in the future. I think her performance is just as good maybe even better than Sissy Spacek's. Ansel Elgort as Tommy Ross is great and he really captures the high school jock role and looks like he walked straight out of an Abercrombie and Fitch magazine. Gabriella Wilde gives a strong performance as Sue Snell and she is really believable. Portia Doubleday is so good it seems she is Chris Hargensen, she's completely different from the good girl in Youth in Revolt. Alex Russell is definitely the breakout star here and I wish there was more of his bad boy Billy Nolan role.<br /><br />  The CGI is really great and it's a breath of fresh air to finally the prom not in split screen! The effects are really good and made me trip up at times. What really works about this film is that it's directed by a woman. Kimberly Peirce understands the story and makes this film really engaging. However, I wish this followed the format of the book or atleast something like the book. The set photos and the teaser looked as if Carrie destroyed the town, wish I wished she did in this. Instead I think the reason this films release got pushed was because MGM and Screen Gems wanted this to be as close as possible to the 1976 version. Which kind of upset me. But anyway, great film, great acting, great visuals. Overall a really fun time and this film is graphic! A couple of times I squirmed a little and had to bite my nails! I'd give this film a solid 9.5/10. Really great film, give it a chance.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun, but sometimes you have to wait 30min between games for another chance to play, by that time I'm on to other things , there are other games similar with no limit
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This movie is worth the1.99!  Zombies are scarier, and seem different, and have evolved.  I can't wait for the next episode.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We are looking for black girls are looking at least one that has been in a way of years  y and equal opportunity for black tray and the truth about that is n roll this using to be a truth you want to be the metro station to the metro station in a truth is n the phone you want yo guy this is n uh huh you'll be able the truth you can long story short it is great
B000EWBKM6|5.0|SAD TO WATCH BUT SO FUNNY!<br />THIS WAS MY FAVORITE SHOW - SO GLAD I HAVE THEM NOW<br />TO WATCH WHENEVER I WANT!<br />ARRIVED WITH THE 8-PACK SERIES I ORDERED TOO!
B00D82BNLC|5.0|The central character is Leigh, who loses her husband to cancer at an early age. Devastated by the loss, with a child to raise and not enough money, she is determined to move forward. Leigh won't give up, and as a result, her life takes a turn for the better. When she unexpectedly comes into enough money to fulfill her dream and build a new life for herself and her son, Coast to Coast Paranormal is born.<br /><br />The book takes the reader through the creation of the paranormal investigation company, the recruitment of staff who become an extended family, and the investigation that follows. The investigation, however, is nothing like a typical paranormal hunt, and the ramifications of the crew's time at Greenhurst, are life threatening and life changing.<br /><br />The author provides excellent description and detail that allows the reader to become a part of the gripping story. The characters are well established and I had no trouble relating to them. They developed into real people and the novel read like a true story. It drew me in and had me turning pages quickly.  I'll be watching for the next Coast to Coast Paranormal adventure.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I like this dictionary because it tells the meanings<br />of the words in the book it is an amazing  book to<br />read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great scenery good characters good theme<br />Minion overload overly loaded with minions all the main characters from the movie including minions
B00B8ED7OS|5.0|The author was successful in the creation of characters, albeit monsters, with some unique physical/metaphysical attributes, as well as amazingly complex psychological issues. The quasi-human main characters, Siris and Julian, have a history that adds to their current circumstance and creates a multifaceted relationship. Definitely a sexually explicit read, Monster managed a sensuality that I found surprising.<br /><br />I found \\"Monster\\" to be a well written, easy to read paranormal novel, with a distinctive plot and good character development. Based on the storyline and the complexity of the characters, it deserves five stars.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I can't believe that my own name is in the book it is very exciting to see the words that I never really thought was a real word
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A good read that kept me reading late into the night. Happier ending than most of King's books, but who says that's a bad thing.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Good idea but not ready for prime time. When and if there are more apps for it it will be useful but not using it for anything right now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved all these books!! Recommend reading they are exciting and thrilling and steamy romantic all in one! I don read romance novels butter these WOW!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the adult story of Danny Torrance.  Filling in the blank between the child and the adult and watching the growth was very enjoyable.  Couldn't stop reading until I had finished.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Could there be two more obnoxious people who are linked together? Oh maybe I shouldn't.... anyway the story was absolutely compelling, surprises were gradually sifted to you & then the final outcome was not necessarily a good one. I must admit I was totally immersed in the story to find what the finale would be but I didn't want it to end the way it did. Thought provoking story... what would you do?
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A chilling book.  And kindle wants me to &#34;share.&#34;  I think not.  This book is hardly an exaggeration of the concentration of power and collective mythology already here.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Tis book has way to many words but believe it or not I read it all  it took me about to days.I only did it because I was betted so it was torture but for u all who lv to read dictionaries about like people tis is it book  happy reading
B000002VCQ|5.0|I bought this CD a second time because of how much I enjoyed it the first time around. What a talented artist. Wish she was still around to make more great music.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Easy controls fun game to play..I would recommend this hack n slash Rpg and also download the next game.good graphics and atmosphere
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book through the very end.  It leaves the reader with a deep sense of family and who can lose in  our lives.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is so a addicting. You will like candy crush. It is a fun game. I play it a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Impeccable viewing, uninterrupted programming,clear, consice images. Same goes for Seasons One and Two. What more can one ask for? Thoroughly enjoyable experience!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you are  thinking of reading this book, do. But before you do, read the first two first. They explain a lot. I highly recommend this book.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Different tech, same thin plot line, same stories of obvious dialog and cliche self sacrifice for the greater good.<br /><br />Pros: Good CG.<br />Cons: Everything except the CG.
B0050KEVO6|3.0|The game starts off fun. You mix and match discovering things you didn't think possible but one you've done it all there isn't a point to keep it. Just a one hit wonder.
B005H9B44A|5.0|We had never seen the stories of any of the Avengers movies, so did not know the stories.<br /><br />We watched this one, and Captain America, and any others we could find, to catch up before the Avengers movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is  Avery good and fun app I love all the different things u can do just sent like how fast the energy runs out
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|We loved this - but only watched it after we got background on others, thru Thor, Captain America, and so on.<br /><br />Without those as background, I do not think we would have enjoyed this as much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome game!! Me and my son both love it! Highly recommended!! It's fun for everyone in the family :)
B002KV4NTQ|4.0|It's easy to focus on the big hits &#34;Brown Sugar&#34; and &#34;Wild Horses,&#34; but the deep tracks like &#34;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&#34; and &#34;Dead Flowers&#34; also have some killer grooves.
B00E8G5H6Y|1.0|Honestly I am very unhappy with the product itself. I pre-ordered Season 5 on Blu-Ray and it doesn't even work. So now I have to figure out how to update firmware without screwing up my Blu-Ray player! However the season is great! I just wish I could watch it in HD instead of crappy youtube quality or whatever other crappy internet quality provides. So for those who are ordering the Blu-Ray version I would definitely wait a few weeks. And even before you order it or if you buy it at your local Fred Meyers, I would do some research. But I would wait a few weeks. So to sum it up I am NOT very happy at all!<br /><br />But like I said, the season itself was fantastic. I have always loved the Clone Wars since the movie, and even before the movie. I really wish they didn't cancel the show. And I also wish that who ever was in charge of the production facility for the blu-ray discs would get his/her act together because he/she caused a lot of people time and money! Especially mine!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever since I was born!One time I race someone who has a nice car on it! I love this game:)
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Keeps you on edge and guessing the whole way through. It's nice to see a good movie these days without having to fast forward thru vulgarity. Tried watching pain and gain before this and was disgusting. This movie however was very good without having to be foul in any way
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Singing and acting was excellent. You may want to crank up the volume for that WOW effect. Might just be one of your favorite Phantom of the Opera movies that was made.
0439023521|5.0|I read this because someone in my book group recommended it. I didn't expect to like it based on nothing but the name and the cover.But the stark cover art led to the absolutely intriguing world of Katniss and Peeta and the evil rulers of a world turned bad and despotic. If you think you won't like this book even after hearing about the success of the movie and the series, give it a try anyway. It's better than you think it will be! I was lucky because I started to read the books just recently so I got to read them all at once. Trust me. It's an awesome experience and you will forget about everything else and become a but anti-social.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It has finally come to Amazon store. I am now a total addict.. I love this game...it was worth the wait... thank you Amazon and Google...finally cooler heads prevail...
B003O86FMW|5.0|People like to say that this book isn't as good as The Hunger Games. I think it's just that The Hunger Games took us by surprise that such an awesome character and totally unique and amazing story could emerge into our lives. So we all expected great things from Catching Fire and I think this book delivers on the expectations. It's great to become reimmersed in the lives of Katniss and Peeta. The tension and jealousy and mistrust just means more now. As good as the movie will be, the book should be read beforehand. So read it now!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I am disappointed that when you get to a certain point, you must buy things to continue.  Thought you had an option.....I guess you do.  Buy or you can't move on.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Great book. Love the series. Wonderfully and imaginatively written. Cross between twilight and Harry potter in a good way! Can't wait to rads the next!
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Fact of life:  Buddy Guy NEVER disappoints, and this 2 disc masterpiece is no exception.  BG makes guitar playing sound so effortless that you almost forget he has been making beautiful music for over 5 decades.  One moment he is transporting us back to Hendrix-styled soaring riffs and the next he is re-defining the genre for the next generation to discover.  I predict that 100 years from now, students of popular music history will refer to this album as the one which truly captured the spirit of the blues in our time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive and fun. I love it. You actually have to do something in this game, strategies and match. It makes time pass. I have so much fun with this game. All my friends play Candy Crush and love so when it came for the kindle I got it right away and had a great time. This game is not for little kids.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best hunting game for a tablet you can find. Its incredibly detailed and east to get sucked into. There are lots of different animals to hunt and guns to purchase. I recommend this game to any hunting game enthusiast. Happy hunting!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is awesome. And I can get it for free. I recommend it for any age it is very challenging also. You will get addicted.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|After completing the Jobs biography I wanted to know more about the genius behind the Apple II and early technical developments of the company.  Jobs was charismatic, visionary, and not a particularly nice person while Woz was smart, creative, and a nice guy.  This book is a good overview of what Woz did and believes.  As in all autobiographical works the picture presented reflects how the person wants to be remembered but iWoz comes across as a fair account of his life to date and the things that are important to him.<br /><br />I recommend both books, Jobs and iWoz to anyone interested in the history and legend of Apple as well as the early development of personal computers.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|Troll Hunter is the largely popular Norwegian parody to \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and quite possibly the most well known of all the Vietnam War satires. Troll Hunter brings in big laughs and maybe even a few tears as well.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|If you ever heard of Joe Bonamassa but you've not yet given him a listen, this CD will show you who he is from his very best side...at home with the blues across the entire range of styles.  Whether blistering the air with a resonator and slide, or applying that slide to his acoustic or electric with a vengeance, Joe Bonamassa is in his element on this work.  This CD will be hailed for years to come as Joe's best!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|So unique and inspired. Just when I thought I couldn't love dogs any more. A work of art. Thank you for writing this.
B00DTB1NNA|5.0|From where I'm sitting, Joe is the man!  This release is no exception.  He is still on his game after all of these years.  He has the R&B tip on lock.  All of the songs are hittin' and he maintains that smooth and sexy groove that he's known for.  This cd gives back to what I call &#34;real R&B music&#34;, and he does it oh so well.  Joe, however you do what you do, please continue to do it well, and I will continue to invest in you.  YOU GO, JOE!!!!!

B007EC27QM|3.0|What's the big surprise? It's a frikkin calculator reflecting the  needs of the majority of its simpleton users. Can't figure out a tip in your head? Don't have a clue what OOO, or Precedence, is for? Not a problem-it's gotcha covered. This calculator is made for your kind. You know, like, early 21st century USA, duh.<br />  Of course, this pos would be summarily rejected in India, China, or Korea, where precision and technical fundamentals are valued, but this is the mighty USA. You may have heard of us...we were THE world superpower from the 1970's to 2001-more than a quarter of a century!<br />  What's that you say-China has been the undisputed world superpower for the greater part of recorded human history, only losing that distinction for an infinitesimal blip of time in the latter part of the 6th millennium?<br />  Well...that may be, but this calculator can do square roots and stuff, if you just touch and drag sideways. It's like magic. It doesn't do quite as many functions as the NOVUS (National Semiconductor) calculator I bought for college in 1976, but, see, we were the world's superpower then. We HAD to be on top. Lots of people died in wars and stuff to get us to that point. So, yeah, we've been there, done that. Now it seems to be the will of the people to let some other country take over those reins and lead the US.<br />  Now we gots a govment ministration that's reflectic of the people, man. Things is waay more relax now then olden times. That was than n this is now. We don't gotta write all proper like, or talk good all the time. An we don't gotta do no math cuz that what calculators r4. You got nuthin to loose w/dis calculator, is what im sayin...Wurd yo, peace out.
1401938906|4.0|Having received this book today and won it through Goodreads First Reads, which is a pretty epic giveaway section on the site, I decided to give the book a try. So far, the book has turned out pretty well, most of the concepts have always been more natural for me, but i'm glad they're in the book, so others can enjoy it and hopefully make the most of it. Even extremely religious individuals should give the book a chance, if it works, then it works, and if it doesn't, well at least you read something interesting. The more you focus on negative things and worry too much, the worse it gets, but if you focus on the good, then everything seems a little better. I'm going to keep the review quite short, since I would prefer not to spoil it, ill just leave it as science and religion are more connected than people might think, or at least, they don't have to always be exclusive from one another. So take a chance, either it works, or it doesn't, and ill admit that this book might not be for everyone and odds are a lot of people won't care for/believe the things in it, but isn't life about taking chances and giving new things or ideas a try?

B000G7PNAE|5.0|I bought this c.d. because I have this on a record. I liked it so<br />much that is why I bought it. It is great music to listen to. I recommend it. I have been a fan for years.
B00BOLQGIO|4.0|First, I have to say something very personal, the girl that plays snow white (the young one) is so annoying!!!! Her face and her mouth...really, Disney couldn't find a more likeable or cute kid???<br />Anyway, I think season one was better simply because there was many plots and misteries. Every chapter was better and better discovering the true identities of each character.<br />By far the best acting comes from Mr.Gold, Regina, Cora, Belle, Hook and sometimes Emma. The couple of prince charming and Snow white is sooooo boring, seriously, we get it...true love, ok, move on.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|seems to work well so far. i like that it is so small. using with iphone 5s.  too bad it does not come with the lightning cables but i guess price is right... and nice that actually if cable goes bad you just get a new cable and not the whole charger.

0321934318|5.0|I teach Lightroom classes and this book is an excellent text. It is clearly written, the examples are easy to follow, and Scott makes the example images available for download from his website. This makes it much easier to learn the techniques. This is a great book for those new to Lightroom and for those wanting a reference to look up techniques not used very often.

B00CHNKJFO|5.0|The current version of this app is 2.1.  Amazon still carries 1.0.  This is why those of us unfortunate enough to buy this from amazon can't buy new tables.  Still a great pinball game and does deserve a better review.<br /><br />*Edit, took them a bit longer but Amazon did update to the latest version so now all tables should be available.

0062225790|3.0|Richard Dawkins is an amazing scientist. I have always thought so and this first part in his autobiography trilogy do reinforce my favorable view on Dawkins. His greatness, in my opinion,  primarily lies in his unequaled ability to convey science to the general public using a language which should make him eligible for the Nobel prize in literature (seriously!). His book, the selfish gene is probably the book that have meant the most to me personally, all categories, and reading excerpts from it in this book made me remember what a great book it was, and still is. In fact, reading “An appetite for wonder”, made me decide to re-read Dawkins original best-seller (which I am now doing).<br /><br />Yes, Dawkins is a fantastic writer and scientist, but this book, on the whole, did not live up to my admittedly high expectations. Perhaps others will disagree with me but I am not personally very interested in great people’s childhood, unless it is truly extraordinary. Yes Dawkins grew up in Africa and that was probably interesting, however, I would personally have preferred if this section was significantly shorter or left out.<br /><br />The book gets more interesting when Richard gets into Balliol college, Oxford. As a University teacher one of my favorite sections of the book was Dawkins description of the education system in Oxford. Their system in which students each week study a new topic by reading up on the scientific literature and try to form hypotheses, and then discuss what they have learnt with tutors who are also leading scientists made me, well… jealous. He claims that students at oxford never asked the question, “will this be on the exam?”, which is a question I get all too frequently…<br /><br />Following his description of the education system in Oxford a semi-interesting description of his early years in academia follows. The book, in my opinion reaches its climax towards the end when Dawkins discusses and reads excerpts from the Selfish Gene. I realize it may sound nerdy but just hearing a few lines from that book can increase my pulse significantly, and it was interesting to get to understand how the book came about. I was also pleased to find out that, like myself, the great writer Richard Dawkins does not write his book in one go. Rather, every sentence that he writes have been written and re-written many times. Like the natural selection of biological organisms, this way of writing should lead to evolution of better sentences and in the end a better book. This is certainly the case with the Selfish Gene.e.

B00FPGSPQU|2.0|Part 3 was really not funny at all.  Wish they wouldn't have made this a trilogy.  The closing scene was the funniest part in the whole thing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a hard book to begin.  The story of Nick and Amy grabs you about half way through, and holds you until the end.  However, the ending was horrible!  It was like stepping off a cliff and never reaching the bottom.  Don't think I would recommend it to anyone.

B00640Z0RI|5.0|This book consists mostly of anecdotes, introspection, and vignettes experienced by the author - a writer who went to Vietnam as a young man to observe and report on the war. It offers a unique, well-written, unusual perspective of the situation on the ground from the view of those doing the fighting.<br /><br />I loved it, and when I looked into the author I discovered he collaborated with Kubrick on the screenplay for<br />'Full Metal Jacket', and that fits perfectly. The protagonist, other characters, plot, and tone of that film reflect exactly those of this book.
0345803507|5.0|This book arrived quickly. It was new and good quality paper. I like the way the author writes, very captivating. I would recommend it to adult readers.

140006922X|4.0|This book makes the reader think. It is a good book for people looking for alternative perspectives based on science or rational thinking.  Caution, this book challenges the Christian thinking that has been pounded into our brains without any support except the words &#34;trust us we know what we are saying is true&#34; or &#34;you have to have faith because faith is believing without knowledge&#34;. The same &#34;trust us&#34; statements made by the same people who protected child molesters; who made millions from German gold during the war; who took sides with Hitler so the Jews could be &#34;reduced&#34; in their influence; and who say woman should know their place and not make waves, and only men are leaders of the church because &#34;God wanted it that way&#34;.  Hmmmm... Dogma without thinking, religion without support.  If you are a doubter, or if you are looking for alternative ideas because you can think for yourself, or even if you are not a doubter, this book is worth reading so that one is informed of a different line of thinking.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I was first attracted to this story when the first trailer was released because I shared the same name. Pretty much the only reason I went to see it in the theaters and I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it more the next time around. So I was confused when it didn't do so good. Of course now I know that's because of the negative narritive behind its release and the marketing, not the movie itself. It's very unfortunate because it's so good. Whenever I find out someone I know hasn't seen it, which is a few since not many went to see it, I get excited because I get to watch it with them. Everybody I have watched it with doesn't understand why it did so bad and regrets not ever watching it on the silver screen.<br /><br />After all is said and done everything bad about the movie has nothing to do with the watching part of it which is pretty much the only important part. Do yourself a favor and watch it and curse the gods of Hollywood afterward.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't give this game a second look because I thought it was just an easy kids game. I was wrong. The first 10 - 15 levels are fairly easy, but after that they get harder and harder and like another reviewers noted, addictive! I have to conquer these levels and make it to the end!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Much different from the movie, but I liked them both. This is a much more personal book than can be portrayed on screen.<br /><br />I am a huge zombie geek (slow not fast) and this is one of my favorites now. I have gotten a few friends to read it and they feel the same way.

B005LAII80|5.0|One of the best action movies of the year. Very surprised how good it was, I would recommend this movie to any action movie fan.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I must be the minority.  I don't count The Shining as one of my top 10 King books.  But in Dr. Sleep, King smoothly picks up the threads of the story and weaves an engaging new tale.  I saw shades of The Green Mile in this novel and lots of well written characters and gripping plot lines.  I liked this better than The Shining.
B008OOYALE|5.0|It love this this game! The only  thing is that I wish that the kindle  version had as much as the opening. Like the battle dome. Do you f think you can add that stuff? I'd really like to craft dragons on my kindle version of dragon story to.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|AMAZING series!  I had to serially watch it, because I could never wait to see what would happen next.  Its been a long time since I got so invested in the characters of a show.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I choose this book because we read it in a book club.  There is so much to talk about it was a good choice.  The book was a fast moving story with characters that you can connect to.

B00D3LA5WG|5.0|I loved it to see 2 teen age boys trying to help  a  man find  a long lost love.This was a great movie with human emotions .<br />14 year olds  who finds  a place they like,then see  some provisions and knows some one else has found this place and lives here.They take a likeing to him when they see and talk to him and very much want to help.It's  a funny witty and  good  movie.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|But an enjoyable, entertaining, & educational read.  I have already suggested this book to a number of teacher friends & parents. The ideas presented went against my original beliefs & experiences, but I can see the points made.
B00FEN1C50|2.0|This movie does little to exercise the mind, or provide anything more than present good \\"wet\\" graphics and some action. The plot is very weak and makes poor use of actor's talent.
B008EL25LE|3.0|This game is similar to many others that involve clicking or swiping groups of like objects to remove them from the screen.  Beyond that, I couldn't really see any point or strategy.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|As other reviews have stated, this is a great game...if you buy it through the Google Play store where it is actually updated.  It is ludicrous that the Play store version of this app is at v5.0.1 and the Amazon version is at v1.2.  Don't get ripped off by the Amazon version, the best version is on the Play store.

0380807343|3.0|On a rare occasion (very few and very far between) I will enjoy a movie more than I enjoy its book derivative.  Indifferently, this is so for Coraline.  This is not to say that you should skip the book completely.  No.  That would be misguided advice.  The writing is admirably short and to the point, but sometimes descriptively repetitive.  Matter-of-fact narrative just didn't compete with the eerily painted and explored worlds of the stop motion feature for me.  At times an extremely touching ode to loving one's own family, I would recommend this page turner in a heartbeat, but will also implore you to watch the film (and watch it again if you already have).
0887081770|5.0|This is the best Eric Carle book ever written. I highly recommend this book for children ages 4-9. It is perfect. The best part is that it is a pop up book filled with surprises.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|These are awesome. There are torx bits and everything. I work in IT and this has come in handy a ton. I also fix laptops from time to time for friends and for money which has been where this is most handy. Nice, small to medium bits.
B001IFZL50|3.0|I have this on both DVD and Blu Ray. I bought the blu ray because I wanted a sharper picture to go along with the upgraded sound. Honestly I don't think it was worth the money. The sound quality on the DVD version is just as good as the blu ray and the picture is almost the same. There's a slight upgrade in parts, but on the whole I felt like I was watching the DVD version when I had the blu ray in (most of it has the same grainy quality to it - not saying this is bad as it's the style it was shot in, just that it looks the same as the DVD), again, minus beefer sound quality, especially during the battle scenes.<br /><br />One thing that really set this version apart is losing the military glossary book from the DVD. It is included in this set, but it's interactive on the disks. To some that might not matter, but when I'm watching and want to look up a term, it's so much easier to just pull out the book and flip a few pages rather than interrupting the flow of the show by fussing with the remote. I enjoy the book so much I took it from the DVD set and put it into the blu ray set so I'd always have it handy.<br /><br />All in all, it's an good purchase if you're dead set on having a blu ray version, but if you don't have either, I'd still recommend getting the DVD version over the blu ray. It just doesn't offer enough to make it worth the additional money.
B008JFUNNM|4.0|I was a huge Tom Hanks fan in the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, but it's been a while since he turned in an exceptional performance. I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, but Hanks hasn't been great since Cast Away 12 years ago. After hearing the early buzz about Captain Phillips, I was hoping one of my favorite actors would return to peak form.<br /><br />Although Hanks didn't put a foot wrong, I came away a little disappointed. Let me explain why.<br /><br />We meet Rich Phillips (Hanks) as he is driving to the airport with his wife, Andrea (Catherine Keener). This introduction is somewhat brief, and Catherine Keener plays no further part in the movie. What it does do is allow us to see how Phillips prepares for a trip. He's aware of the dangers of piracy, but he's an experienced man.<br /><br />The next characters we meet are the pirates. This introduction is a much longer segment, and is extremely chaotic. We learn that life is hard for these Somali pirates and that they have bosses that they have to answer to. These people felt like standard villains to me, and we end up knowing little about them despite the length of time spent showing us their homeland. They talk in heavy accents when they do speak  English, and they have bad teeth. Yep, these are the people we are supposed to hate.<br /><br />Some of the most impressive scenes in the movie happen near the beginning as we see Phillips go about his routine. Hanks is particularly good at playing understated roles, and he's completely believable. The tone changes when the inevitable meeting with the pirates occurs. If you were to sit down and guess what kind of things might happen from this point, you would probably be pretty close. I know the movie is supposed to be based on real events, so I can't deduct points for lack of originality, but there aren't many surprises.<br /><br />I'm not going to delve into the plot beyond these scenes which all take place in the first 30 minutes. Anything more would venture too deeply into spoiler territory.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass also directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, which are among the best action movies I own. If you are familiar with those, it won't surprise you to learn that Greengrass employs similar techniques in Captain Phillips. He tries to enhance the action by showing extreme closeups and point of view shots, intended to place us right in the middle of the action. You can also expect to see plenty of shaky cam effects. Although this worked quite well, it will definitely annoy some viewers.<br /><br />Captain Phillips is a tense account of what can happen in dangerous waters. When you see all of the events transpire, you might be wondering whether it wouldn't be cheaper and safer to hire a few armed guards if you're transporting cargo through the region in question. The ultimate resolution was infinitely more expensive.<br /><br />I'm happy enough with Captain Phillips, and will be adding it to my collection, but I'm still waiting for a role meaty enough to extract another Oscar-worthy performance from Tom Hanks. Don't avoid it, but temper expectations a little.<br /><br />Overall score 3.75/5ore would venture too deeply into spoiler territory.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass also directed The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, which are among the best action movies I own.

1449433251|5.0|I grew up on Calvin and Hobbes books and strips, and wanted to get the hardcover set but the price was never something I wanted to pay, even for C&H. When I saw this paperback version I was sold. The books are very well done and very sturdy. I read a few pages per night and have had no issues with any coming out or the book itself falling apart. I highly recommend this.<br /><br />One minor issue is some of the pages look dirty, like someone in the factory didn't have clean hands when putting mine together. All in all it's a nit pick, but as others have mentioned it as well you might want to be aware of it.<br /><br />Oh, and there are some minor edits as others have noted. In the paperback there's only two edits about adoption and that's it. The one with Hobbes in the washer is still in my version.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Extremely well written and produced. Invites the viewer to explore their own imagination. Very highly recommended for all dreamers and romantics.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|I don't do film reviews as there's plenty of places online for that. This is for the product quality. Overall the films are top notch with the bluray sound being amazing. I had to take off a star for the Bourne Supremacy because, while the picture is very sharp and clear, it's also very green (and in some scenes very yellow - Pam Landy's hair in a lot of her scenes looks like it was colored with a yellow highlighter - very distracting).<br /><br />The special features are fantastically done on all the movies. The ability to see notes about the characters and gadgets in the film (either while it's playing or separately) are great and really give you the option to get more insight into the character motivations and the technical aspects of the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this on blu ray, it's well worth the money, especially if you're a Bourne fan. Just be aware that Supremacy looks a bit green (like Fellowship of the Ring on blu ray)

0307271609|4.0|This is the biography of Empress Dowager Cixi, the woman who at the age of 12 became a concubine of Emperor Xianfeng which is a great honor even though she was initially only a low level member of his harem.  Fortunately for her, she gave birth to the emperor's first son, and was therefore elevated to #2 concubine.  She and #1 were both mothers to Cixi's son.<br /><br />When the emperor died, Cixi and #1 managed a coup which made them regents over the four-year-old new emperor.  The two women acted on Cixi's ability to keep her eye on the big picture as she instituted gradual reforms to pull the country out of abject poverty.  Later her son died young and she got her sister's young son designated as the heir.  Once again Cixi was the regent, keeping China on a steady course toward power, respectability, and prosperity.<br /><br />Unfortunately that nephew undid much of the good Cixi had accomplished and he mismanaged relations with Japan so badly that the country was once again plunged into dire poverty.  Only when he admitted Cixi into negotiations and political dealings did things improve.<br /><br />Cixi was virtually a prisoner in the emperor's harem most of her life and yet was able to maneuver the men in power to her way of thinking.  When they listened to her, China prospered, when they didn't, the country failed.  She died in 1908.<br /><br />The author was born in China, coming to Great Britain in 1978.  This is a work based on scholarly research and the book will have footnotes, bibliography, photographs, and an index.  However, it is accessible to the general reader.  I didn't know anything about her, so I learned not only her story but quite a bit I had forgotten or didn't know about Chinese history.  I come away from my reading with a great admiration for Cixi and for the journey China traveled from a closed  country to the power it is today.<br /><br />Highly recommended especially for women's history<br />Source:  Amazon Vine

0307341550|2.0|No doubt that Gillian Flynn is a talented writer. Perhaps this was a first novel and the novel, despite the writing, has few redeeming qualities. Flynn included a number of different DSM-IV diagnoses in this novel including 2 personality disorders, alcohol dependence, substance abuse, and a disorder I dare not name without giving away part of the story. Then there are the illegal behaviors such as child abuse, animal abuse, rape, use of illicit drugs and, of course, murder. The small town where the story takes place is peopled with gossipy uncaring people. The main character is seriously flawed. Flynn appeared not to know when to stop when it came to picking maladies to spice up a murder mystery. It was over-the-top and the only book that, once read, I deleted from my Kindle.
0802473156|5.0|These self help books are a bit painful but this one is actually quite good and my wife, who resists these on principle, enjoyed it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and I'm so happy Candy Crush is back on my Kindle! Thanks a bunch. :)
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Normally I read the reviews of other customers before reading a book just to get an idea of what may be good or not so good. I was disappointed to see the number of people who had given the book low scores as I'd been waiting for this sequel. Like many, I was expecting this to be the obvious next step in Bridget's life alongside Mark Darcy. Instead, Helen Fielding brilliantly gave us the perfectly unexpected. Sure she could've gone into the world of \\"happily ever after\\" with Bridget tripping over her wedding dress landing into the wedding cake, Bridget confused and chaotic with baby seats for the car or Marc smiling with unabashed pride at their son's first steps. And she would've done this why? To satisfy millions of fans who also want Jane Austen to come back to life and write a sequel to Pride and Prejudice. Instead, she took the core makeup of Bridget and took her into life's realities.....as in truth all of her Bridget books have actually been about. I found myself relating in so many ways to this Bridget as I had to the younger Bridget. The continued questioning of and challenging of self as age progresses and the world changes around you. The same feelings of why has the world turned itself into a cyber system with people becoming more and more competitively detached from things that matter. The battle of the bulge and promises to always do better. Helen Fielding does a marvelous job of showing her audience about the growth of character even if the character doesn't recognize said growth. She shows us the masks and false roads to the media's portrayal of perfection that nobody is immune to. And lastly the dawning realization of what's truly valuable and why. Critics who didn't get any of this out of this book sadly missed a great opportunity to stop looking for the expected ending and instead enjoy the adventure.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Beast device ever for streaming for taplet and smart phones<br />Video and audio quality are excellent and good price for the product
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After the first episode I knew I was going to love this show.  I've watched the first two seasons in less than two weeks and can't wait to finish season 3.  It's interesting to see English upper class living through historical moments.  And the love stories are fascinating.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|My wife loves anything joss whedon directs and this is no different. It is very well shot produced and written. Watch it!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This is a great story, and the movie is well-executed.  This movie was not worthy of a best picture Oscar.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I chose the rating because I am perplexed that I'm not solving the levels as fast as I think I should, yet a little disappointed when I do make progress because that part has ended. Play it and you'll understand what I mean. This game is extremely aggravating but addictively challanging. The difficulty increases as you progress through the various levels keeping it delightfully annoying.  This was a random selection for me and I am so happy I got it.  I highly recommend it.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I had heard a few reviews of this book that were pretty critical.  I found the book to be enjoyable, earnest, and thought-provoking.  One issue I had reading it on a Kindle was that I couldn't easily flip to the back and see what references she was citing.  Some of the studies or statistics she references might be used out of context--I'm not sure.  But her personal experiences are worth hearing about, and it was a timely read for me.
B005K17RU0|1.0|You were such a fantastic help for every day but somedy wanted to improve and put his thick muddy boot! How can I revert to the old treasured version?
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like the game, but hate the fact that the portions can only be bought.  Very challenging and frustrating at time.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The headphone are prefect for the young athelete or elderly.<br /> We use them for audio books and MP3s while walking.<br /><br />A good value!
B002JXK5VU|4.0|I'm not really into Sci-Fi, but I found this series to be different enough that I find it entertaining. The characters work well together and feel natural in the portrayal of there various parts. Most of the story lines are original enough to hold my interest and the sets and effects are well done.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and ending up watching it myself. Wish the series hadn't ended. I want more.
B00AHG9KYE|4.0|Good story if you can just dismiss the initial premise - the science just doesn't work.  But if you can ignore that and go with it, it was a good book.  It's not a typical Clarke book because his science is usually solid. In this book, Clarke does go on to paint a picture of a very plausible future for humanity.  I'm not in love with the explanation about the monoliths, but I'm not sure what would have been a better explanation.  Mostly I enjoyed reading what Clarke thinks our lives will be like in 3001.  If you've ever read \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" and know how much of what Jules Verne described actually came true, than you may enjoy wandering around in the \\"probably pretty accurate\\" future with Clarke in \\"3001\\".
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Waited so so long for Amazon to finally give us this app......but SO worth the wait.  This game is addictive, UNTIL you hit a level that stops you in your tracks.....then it makes you want to scream!!!!  Thankfully those levels are spread out enough that you muddle through and still continue to enjoy the game.  One of the only games that I play on a daily basis.
B000I8G5B2|4.0|Uma Thurmond's character surprised me on a couple of occasions, which was a nice touch.  Great story; well written; well acted; poignant and slightly scary all at once.  You don't have to be a sci fi fan to enjoy this one.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|A very entertaining book.  This book shows how lovable and quirky people really are.  And some of them were also wise.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works very well with netflix and youtube. I hope google has other applications available on the chromecast soon. Casting chrome from the laptop is not very smooth.
B000NMZFKK|4.0|I love a well acted movie that takes on the complexity of humanity. This one is full of a good mix of sadness and triumphant strength. It is not a feel good film, but it is one I was proud to share with my now teenage children. It demonstrates that life is no Disney flick, but even the ugly part of people can be beautiful.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I started watching on tv and then couldn't finish the ending...so Amazon had it for $.33 yes $.33 and with postage came in under $5. Funny show and I love the guy who now plays McGarrett on Hawaii 5 O
B0053KWDES|5.0|I've tried this booster, that booster, etc. etc.,I am extremely pleased with the E-11. I played drums in a Rock band in the 80's, so I'm kinda deaf. I wore my new Sony headphones and the E-11 and took my motorcycle on the 405!! I could hear GREAT! and I still heard the Firetruck siren!!
B0007TKNII|5.0|It's great, I like the widescreen, My dog likes to howl at the music, Mini Driver is so funny as charlota
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Everything is amazing about this except the fact that it's too short. I would love to see Pride & Prejudice in it's full length with this cast and production. Beautifully executed bu far, far too short.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A perfect item for my Kindle Fire....and a perfect solution and reading guide for anyone wanting to read the entire bible in one year... You might consider this for a gift..I am really enjoying having my copy so close at hand all the time.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I was listening to a radio talk show host talk about watching this.  I decided to try to try it.  Wound up watching two full seasons in one weekend that is how addicting it is.  Even if you take away the beautiful sets and scenery, the actors who make you feel their every emotion and the brilliant writing, it is worth watching just to find out what Maggie Smith will say next!!  No one else could have come close to playing the part as she does.

B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I'm not a huge Hugh Jackman fan, but he's great in this movie.  A nice heartwarming story about a cold man finding his worth and his son.
034580404X|1.0|I couldn't stick to the third book of the trilogy. It's just more of the same moaning, the same sex scenes, the same routines, the same repetitive conversations, and the same unrealistic fantasy situations. I am so bored with it! I know where it's headed. I don't mind suspending disbelief for a good book, but I have had to put up with the same thing for two books already, and I'm tired! I just want it to be over so I can read a book I really like. I feel forced to finish it now because I bought the trilogy, which I now regret.<br /><br />I had been wanting to read this book ever since I saw a quote from this story referencing Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urvervilles about a year ago. Tess is one of my favorite novels-- in fact, I even named my beloved black cat D'urberville-- so it is naturally that I would be swayed by a quote like this one: &#34;I could hold you to some impossibly high ideal like Angel Clare or debase you completely like Alec d'Urberville.&#34; This alone led me to make a mental note to read the trilogy someday. However, I made the conscious decision to buy the trilogy only recently, after a fellow bookworm friend of mine gushed on Facebook about how much she enjoyed the novel, even when she used to consider this type of stuff &#34;drivel.&#34; Curiosity got the best of me, as it did for our hapless protagonist, so I ordered it immediately on Amazon and dove right into the book as soon as I received it.<br /><br />Okay, so a handsome, fit multi-billionaire falls in love with a supposedly plain Jane, marries her after only six weeks of knowing her, he is overprotective and buys her more than she could ever need just because he can. However, before the happy ending they have to work through many of his lifelong narcissistic and sadistic issues, which he will overcome in just a few weeks for her. Yeah, obviously written by a woman. It's a nice fantasy, I have no problem suspending disbelief at the likelihood of that happening-- billionaires need lovetoo, and sometimes they get tired of gold-digging bombshells and ladies of their own station, so they go for the first plain girl they come in contact with outside of their profession. However, my problem with the novel is that there wasn't much else to the fantasy other than raw, graphic, endless sex.  I have no problem with sex either, many of my favorite classics contain it as well. But in the classics, you don't get it until after you have decoded the poetry and read between the lines.<br /><br />It's unfair to hold contemporary literature to a classical standard; I do not ask for so much. However, even compared to some of today's writers, I found the prose lacking. This has none of the poetry of Janet Fitch, or the suggestiveness of Martha Brockenbrough, or any kind of insight. Despite Christian Grey's famed intensity, the novel is pure porn-- no insight, little depth.I can see why it's a New York Times bestseller-- very simple, easy to read, and lots of sex. It speaks to the times, and every era gets the fairy tales it deserves.<br /><br />I don't want to totally trash the novel either, because it has succeeded in speaking to millions of readers. It's a great book to get people interested in reading, because it's easy and addicting enough even for those who claim to hate reading. The novel is somewhat educational as it gives one a glimpse into the BDSM lifestyle, which is one of the many forms out there in which individuals like to engage with one another. One doesn't have to like it to understand it as just another way of human sexuality. I am intrigued about Christian Grey's past and why he is the way he is, which which is one of the main things that kept me going through two books. It's like a Bildungsroman in reverse, very post-modern. He definitely has a kind side to him, a side that wants to feed the world due to the experiences he had as a young child. That's what makes him complex, an interesting subject of psychological study.<br /><br />I guess I will stick to my old habit of not reading modern pop novels, but rather sticking only to the movie part, the way I did with Twilight.
B000XR4OC0|1.0|It was my first Toms shoes, so I didn't know that it was a fake one until I got a second pair from Toms website. The insole is too big for the size, causing the shoes to stretch a lot, and the printings on the insole comes off after two days, whereas the authentic pair from Toms website is still intact after one month. As well, I compared the Toms sticker that came with the shoes and they have slightly different font style at the back and the colour is lighter than the authentic one. I wish I could return it for full refund but I don't have the original box and it is pretty worn now. Please do not buy from Amazon and spend extra 5 bucks to get authentic pair from Toms website.

0452289963|5.0|The  radical wisdom contained in this book will not be understood by the typical, average unenlightened person. The reader must be spirtitually ready to receive and thus begin to comprehend what is being conveyed in this text. This book has brought peace and contentment into my own life through the awareness and understanding of the ego. This book is a wonderful companion to the &#34;Power of Now&#34;, also by Tolle. It has been the most important book I have ever read.

1577314808|5.0|This book by Tolle has the real potential to change your life for the better.

It's necessary reading for those of us moving toward a level of higher enlightenment through greater understanding of ourselves.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has become an amazing resource and a powerful catalyst in my life , I highly recommend using as nd getting involved into this app and the plans
B00CUIVGZS|5.0|Brilliant copositions. Inspirational playing. Chick Corea, even after decades of being on the leading edge of progressive contemporary music, continues to expand his own musical ablities and the art of performance and composition with this latest release. For the dedicated and serious musician this well worth a purchase. The enjoyment derived from listening to music of this quality is part of my own personnal health care plan. Consideration should be given to make it part of yours.
B0028INIWE|4.0|Nice collection. Good sound quality. Covers a large sample of music from their career. Some lesser seen songs added to disc.....nice!!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|As a lifelong fan I will say I'm honestly disappointed so far.  I haven't finished the book, but if it wasn't written by King I would say the author ripped off Stephen King.  Some might really like the rehash of old characters and settings and drama, but I wanted something new and this just reads like part 2 of a story that already ended.  Talk about bringing the dead to life!<br /><br />In all fairness I haven't finished the book, but all Kings good stuff I finish fast so what does that say?
B0000696ID|5.0|Loved this movie when I was young!  Wanted my children to see it and have the same fond memories.  Also thought they would enjoy seeing Drew Barrymore as a child :).  Classic!  Priced reasonably and received without any problems. Thanks.

B0091REZMW|5.0|Just started playing. Seems like it will be a fun game. Easy to begin play but has a lot of items to keep one interested. Up to level 11 now and have not been required to pay anything.
B00F35BV64|3.0|I was in the mood for a Sci-fi movie. It did the job, but the dramatic, emotional music became a distraction.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just completed the first four rooms. It seems to be a good game for short breaks. No instructions are really necessary, all you are doing is using what you find to open the door.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so nice that finally they improved the game &amp; now I can play on my kindle fire. so much better than getting the laptop going and so much better swiping with your finger than using mouse or touchpad
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I have been using this app with total success. I only wish that it would not TAKE OFF MY PASSWORD PROTECTION. One of my Excel files contains all my passwords. (1) After I transferred it, the PW was eliminated. In fact the window to ask for the PW never prompted me. I would guess any locked Excel files from work or your friends could not be read and modified and replace. WOW!(2) I WISH Kingsoft had a better and more complete command setup. The vertical string on the top is common for almost all my Kendal Fire HD apps so I cant complain.<br />  Those two things are missing but the application is well worth using and of course the price was super! I wonder it this email allows and reads these email.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This is not just a \\"good new\\" album, or \\"entertaining,\\" whatever - this is a great, magnificent, wonderful gift from Paul. It rocks, it's lyrical, it is very deeply moving. On one song (\\"Early Days\\" in fact) he tosses out the word \\"inspiration,\\" and that's in the center of my reaction to the whole thing - what an inspiration, to have Paul, after all this time, all these changes and experiences, all this music, give us such a gift. It rocks like hell. Then it has songs and tunes that hit you in the belly and heart as being like essential Beatles-style fare. \\"Appreciate\\" is damn psychedelic. \\"Early Days\\" is just the sort of thing we expect, wish for and need and love from our rock-pop saints. \\"I Can Bet\\" teases us about what's \\"next.\\" \\"Scared\\" channels the raw honesty of John Lennon. \\"Road,\\" in my humble opinion, is not just some ditty about Paul himself and whomever struggling along, but about the entire human . . mythic, sci-fi, recovery from horror and terror, into the future, hope for our genome . . journey. A hymn for humanity, as maybe only a guy could do if he knew he was the inheritor and surviving voice of the Beatles' legacy.<br /><br />This is quite cosmic, like one of the greatest musicians and song writers ever coming up with a late-life coda - hopefully one of many more to come - saying he's alive, kicking, rocking, loving, and very much reaching out to us all. Thank you, Paul, thank you, man. Thank you.

Save up your money, and get this app! You can also get this on pc, Xbox, and a few other systems. It's worth it, and you will not rue the day you bought this app, I guarantee that you will not rue the day you bought this. Have fun playing, if you see a doglover98683 in the pc version, say hi!

B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Change is hard--we need all the help we can get even when we know we need to change something. And this book is an invaluable resource to assist with effecting change. Some of this material, two of the three elements to consider for facilitating change, go all the way back to Aristotle's elements for decision-making--&#34;pathos&#34; (the Heaths' Elephant) and &#34;logos&#34; (the Rider). But the contemporary research and illustrations, along with the consideration of the importance of the Path, bring this into the forefront of utility. It's a clinic, really, on engineering and facilitating change. I'm using this to construct plans for change at my workplace, and am confident that this framework will help us. I started off with the Audible.com version, which I listened to while driving to & from class, and moved on to the Kindle version, for better and more focused study. Highly recommended!

B0083P1QUM|4.0|I started reading Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta mysteries at the beginning of the series and during this process I've gotten to know her characters quite well.  Unfortunately, as this long-running series about medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta neared its midpoint at number ten, I began to dislike all of them.  Rich, beautiful, intelligent, sensitive Dr. Scarpetta kept getting into trouble over and over again because she didn't know how to pick her friends.  I really wanted her to stop functioning as everybody's doormat.  I never did warm up to her genius niece, Lucy and her long-running sexual identity crisis.  The major male characters were all jerks.  FBI profiler, Benton Wesley had as much personality as a block of wood.  Ex-cop, Pete Marino was frankly repulsive.<br /><br />What kept me going was Cornwell's plots and the really fascinating forensic backdrop of this series.  It was really wonderful to watch Dr. Scarpetta meticulously search for clues in her refrigerator full of corpses without having to smell the actual smells or see all of the icky stuff that the author so vividly describes.<br /><br />In this 20th entry of the series, Scarpetta is still functioning as the universal doormat, but Benton, who is now her husband unbends enough to call one of the villains a t---ball.  Male chauvinist, Pete Marino falls into a neat plot twist caused by his own boorish proclivities.  Lucy, the world's richest know-it-all looks to be finally settling down with her barn full of planes and helicopters.  There are lots of interesting corpses--older women, this time--and a really vivid underwater scene where Dr. Scarpetta retrieves one of the victims of a serial killer who tangled with a giant turtle well after her death.<br /><br />I still had to plow through lengthy descriptions of designer clothes, designer coffee, designer sunglasses, cars, and helicopters, and there were patches of indigestible dialogue--&#34;'There are any number of volatile organic compounds that could render someone unconscious,' my chief toxicologist says.  'Toluene, carbon tetrachloride, one-one-one-trichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, provided you use high enough levels.'&#34;--but Dr. Scarpetta's careful decipherment of the language of the dead and the hunt for the serial killer kept me reading &#34;The Bone Bed&#34; well past my bedtime for a couple of nights running.d render someone unconscious,' my chief toxicologist says.

B008D28HYS|5.0|These are my favorite style of puzzles/games.  And this app is the absolute BEST one of this style I have ever played!  I got this a few weeks ago as a &#34;Free App of the Day&#34; and have done several puzzles daily with many more puzzles to go.  There are 9 levels with increasing difficulty and about 200 puzzles in total!  Although I got this free, it is well worth the price since it is so much fun!

B00FWLDHSY|1.0|This show is more for children.  Giant robots to combat giant creatures?  Really?  Wouldn't missiles work better?  I kept waiting for Godzilla to show up.  Not worth the $5 admission fee.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|I love special effects. I mean, if it weren't for special effects I wouldn't watch movies and this movie has great special effects. But that's where the good stuff kind of ends. The internal story lines aren't set up correctly and/or completely and too many little question marks arise to take away from the primary plot. That probably due to time editing but if the editors are butchers it can really cut off a movies flow.<br /><br />In the end, though, the effects are what its all about and those don't disappoint. I would like to give this a 2 1/2 but don't have that option. My original rating was 2 but the effects made me give it a 3.<br /><br />You toke roasters will love it.
0812983459|4.0|This is a lovely story of lost love/friendship re-found. The main character, Harold, is just a good soul who sets out to heal old wounds, his and others'. He meets some interesting characters along the way and seems to learn valuable life lessons from all of them. An unusual story but a very easy read. I really enjoyed it.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|One of my family's favorite movies; bought the VHS movie when it first came out over 15 years ago and were watched it as a family many times. Watched it again via Amazon Prime movies and loved it just as much!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|this app is currently not on my phone.  i have been unable to update the app for the past 6 months.  i tried to un-install then re-install and i am now locked out.  i won't even waste my time contacting customer service.  in the past 2 years of having this app, i have found it unreliable.
B0012HEB32|4.0|I really didn't think I would enjoy this series but decided to give it a try. I found the series to be fast paced and thoroughly enjoyable. It's entertaining and worth a try.
B0036TGSIK|2.0|Content Review - So, this film seems promising in premise. The Scarlett Letter loosely playing out in a modern high school setting, staring the terrific Emma Stone. But in my personal, subjective opinion, Easy A just does not add up to much in execution. Stone is one of the brightest young actors around, and she is endlessly charming, adorable and very sharp with her comedic timing. She is just a joy to watch. And the montage of her involuntarily spending all weekend singing along to \\"Pocket Full of Sunshine\\" is great.<br /><br />However, other than that, there is very little to this film. I get it conceptually, but nevertheless the plot overall comes across as contrived, and I do not really buy the \\"moral of the story\\" or the point that it is all trying to make. So, lacking that, we are left with the cast and the comedy. The former is fairly decent - I always enjoy Thomas Hayden Church - although I wish that Aly Michalka's part had better dialog, and Amanda Bynes feels even more out of place than her character is supposed to be. As far as the humor...there just is not that much of it. Some of what is there is of the gross and/or of course sexual variety (Scarlett Letter), FYI.<br /><br />For me, this feels like one of those films that is basically a likeable lead actor (Stone) and a few good jokes, with the screenplay, story and every other part of it merely serving as connective tissue in between. Ultimately: Meh.<br /><br />Packaging/Features Review - The DVD is fine, fairly bare bones. There is an audio commentary with Stone and the director, which honestly is just as entertaining as the film itself, give or take. Is that a compliment?
B00005JPD0|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've watched in ages.  I saw this movie a few days ago for the very first time, until a few days ago I never knew this movie existed.  This is one of those rare movies once you watch it you wonder how did the movie escape you from never knowing about it.
B008JFUUIA|1.0|The one star, aside from being the minimum rating option, is for Rebel Wilson and a couple of the better musical sequences. I doubt that the music actually had much true a capella authenticity in its recording, but it generally sounds good and works as fantasy ear-candy. Other than that, however, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen, in my personal opinion. Someone with different tastes than mine might find a lot here to like, but I find virtually no redeeming value whatsoever, and surprisingly little in the way of actually funny humor.<br /><br />The dialog is extremely lazy and clichéd. The characters are extremely stereotypical (in the offensive, one-dimensional sense, not the effectively simple archetype sense) and clichéd. The plot is predictable. The music, while fairly decent on the whole, is rarely transcendent, edgy or spectacular in my opinion. It is okay, but this film would have benefited from it being spectacular. The humor is often gross-out and/or highly sexualized. That may or may not be objectionable or palatable depending on the viewer. The more universal problem with the humor, again in my personal opinion, is that it is rarely funny. The exception to that is Rebel Wilson, who is endlessly entertaining, but she alone cannot save Pitch Perfect, try though she might.<br /><br />Is this film a satire? Maybe it is, but I would suggest that it fails to be an effective satire just as it fails to be an effective straight film. Nearly everything about it is lazy, cheap and uninspired. Not worth the time or money. That is my take.
B00DOPEGAS|1.0|Because you can't move the pins in this loom, you can't make half of the bracelet designs! Really terrible compared to the awesome Rainbow  Loom.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Me and my daughter are addicted.  We take turns playing it and when we finally beat a level that we have been struggling with you would think we won money.  My son thinks we are nuts.  So glad we can play it on our kindle fire now!
B005JE7XW0|5.0|Hilarious, creative, smart and thoroughly enjoyable- this movie delivers if you're looking for some comedy in your horror collection. The main characters are flawlessly enjoyable.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It is fun but I think it shouldn't slow you down so much when you hit something but it is still really fun
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have not yet watched the DVD, but I know how the movie is.  I went to see it when it was in the theaters.  And like all the others, they did a really good job at trying to get it as close to the book as possible.  Which I know is hard to do because a lot of those scenes from the books are very time consuming.  But they did a good job at trying to get the important scenes that matter in the storyline.  And so ends the Harry Potter stories.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like facebook!! I am able to converse with friends and family. I like some of the games that they have.
B001AEF6BI|4.0|I know for some people they would not care for this movie.  But I enjoyed it.  It is kind of an interesting story of 5 high school kids in a Saturday detention day.  They all get to know each other and maybe learn something from their life stories.
0385536828|4.0|This book tells about one young woman's naiveté about spying during the Cold War. It is a coming-of-age spoof. It may provide the reader with too much detail. For this reason, I had to read the book three times in order to appreciate its cleverness.<br />Usually Ian McEwan's writing is terse and not so richly detailed. I think that his usual readers need to be aware if this. This is a Bildungsroman, meaning that it is a coming-of-age novel, perhaps like Dickens's &#34;Great Expectations&#34; updated to the 1950's and 1960's and having a heroine rather than a hero.<br />This is a small book that demands a lot of concentration. It is not made for speed reading or taking to the beach
B00005JLR2|5.0|I had seen this a little bit when it was on TV, so I decided to buy the movie.  I remembered some of the voices in the movie (like David Hyde Pierce).  This movie is pretty good, of course it is supposed to be the story of Treasure Island only in the future with old time clothes and ships that sail in outer space.  One of Disney's classics.
0307593495|5.0|I think this is an excellent novel. It is not as gory as some of Mankell books.<br />The ending will be a surprise for those who bring preconceived ideas about who represents who. The name of the novel captures the mystery of the story within very well.<br />Whether this is your first Henning Mankell or the most recent, I think this one is fascinating and well worth reading.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|I thought Anthony Hopkins was fantastic. I can not see anyone else paying Hannibal Lector. Fantastic movie. A must see
0143113100|2.0|I am a retired physician. This book is not for scientists. It is probably what people who have suffered brain injuries, had a stroke or have a neurodegenerative disease could benefit from.<br />I believe that Dr. Doidge has had to rethink his ideas about how to take advantage of the benefits of neuroplasticity.<br />I think that this book overemphasizes its upbeat tone. Not everyone will get the wonderful outcomes as the patients that Doidge writes about.<br />I do think that Doidge needs to reedit his book to make it more up-to-date. The fields of brain functioning and repair are moving in a rapid pace. Much of this has come about due to the functional MRI which is becoming increasingly available and less expensive to operate. I would check in at Amazon.com to see if Dr. Doidge has updated this book or written a new one. This is what I plan to do.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is great for learning and reviewing a new language.  I am using it to help me review the Spanish I learned  in high school and learn some new words and phrases.  So far this app is better than I would have expected from a free app.  I highly recommend it.

0547884591|1.0|There is some useful information in this book.  Buy the cheapest used version you can find.  It is not worth the full cost of new.  Additionally, Amazon is not even willing to buy back the book!

B007IXWL2C|3.0|For a book that is going to have a movie made of it the storyline is almost nonexistant.  I'm dissapointed in the whole series.

B00AO3K01C|5.0|`A Tale for the Time being' has an innovative and non-linear structure. Nao, a Japanese teenage girl, has recently relocated from California to Tokyo after her software engineer father lost his job. Nao has decided to commit suicide and as a last meaningful activity, she decides to write a journal telling the story of her great grand mother Jiko, a Zen Buddhist Nun. However, this journal is as much about her and her family as about grandma Jiko. In fact, this journal seems to be an escape route for Nao, her way to deal with her problems - extreme bullying in school, family's financial problems, and her father's acute depression and resulting suicidal tendencies (the idea that suicide is a legitimate means of solving one's problem is a recurring occurrence in this novel. This is probably due to the fact that Japanese Culture is much more tolerant towards suicide.)<br /><br />Travelling across the pacific ocean, this journal reaches Ruth, a Canadian author of Japanese accent who lives with her husband and a pet cat (named Schrodinger) in a remote island. Recovering from the recent death of her mother due to Alzheimer's, Ruth is struggling with writers' block. Alternating between a chapter written by Nao and Ruth's reaction to it, the story moves back and forth between the past and the present, Canada and Japan, Ruth and Nao - until it all converges.<br /><br />I would categorize Nao as one of the most nuanced teenage characters ever written. From being bubbly and humorous, she will suddenly shift gears to something visceral and brutal. Like being hit suddenly by a hammer when you are laughing out loud. Ruth's character on the other hand could have been better itched out. Other characters like Oliver, Ruth's husband, Nao's father and mother, etc. are deliberately underdeveloped, probably to keep the focus on Ruth and Nao and present their world as seen by them.<br /><br />A Tale for the Time Being is an offbeat novel. It will require patience, careful attention and some amount of thinking and introspection to fully understand and appreciate this beautiful book.<br /><br />Ruth is a Canadian/American novelist/filmmaker and her earlier works include the critically acclaimed \\"All over the Creation\\".  'A Tale for the Time Being' is one of the six books shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2013.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Ashutosh<br />[...]
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is super fun! Its much more fun than I thought it would be.  And you don't need Internet to play it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Can't wait to see the movie! I bought the 2nd book so obviously I enjoyed it that much. Hopefully Simon os still interested in Clary since she can't have Jace ;)
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Sometimes I ask myself on what makes a good game. Does it need to be based on gameplay, in which control is in the players' hand and they have full control over their surroundings? Or can it be based on story, in which control is taken away from the player, but they experience a fantastic story and sympathetic characters? Or maybe a mixture of both?    999 is a puzzle game in which it fits into the latter half to a T. 999 stars Junpei, a college student who awakens himself on what appears to be a large cruise ship. Upon escaping his room due to it starting to flood, he finds himself alongside 8 other characters each into the same situation he is. Then a intercom speaker comes on, someone who calls himself \\"Zero\\" has selected Junpei and the other 8 and forces them to play the Nonary Game. The objective, to find the door number 9 in a total of 9 hours or the ship will sink beneath the waves.    I say the words \\"puzzle game\\" to a minor extent however. 999 has two \\"phases\\" to it. The first is almost all reading. To say that there is a lot of text in this game is a massive understatement, 999 has miles upon miles of dialogue and exposition (as well as small sprite based animations and pictures) to move its story. Mind that its a fantastic story, but its still a lot of reading that may turn off gamers that are used to jumping into the action instantly. The second half are the puzzle segments, or as I like to call them \\"Escape the room sequences\\". Basically, your put into a room, room has some obligatory theme based puzzle to it, and you must solve the puzzle to escape.    The puzzles themselves are very well thought out. Some range from using picture ciphers, to musical composition, to even spelling out words in Base 16 and then converting them to numbers. The game comes itself with a calculator even, which is pretty damn useful especially since 75% of all the puzzles in the game are Math or Logic based. They are not hard per say, I only needed help on one of the puzzles.Your cohorts also give hints on the puzzles as well, so it doesn't feel like the game is cheating you in any way. In fact, this game takes pride in doing something I wish more games do more, which is making the player feel like a genius.    Yet the real selling factor to 999 is its characters. Each of the 9 characters in this game are full fledged people. They are not stereotypes or cardboard cutouts, instead each character has their own mindset, their own reason to escape this situation they found themselves in. Each character is in someway connected to each other, and finding those connections are some of the joy this game has to offer. Junpei himself is an interesting protagonist, growing into a confident leader who is willing to stake his life to escape the ship with everyone in tow. His moments of brilliance, when he goes Professor Layton on the Nonary Game had me jumping up and down with joy. Other characters include June, a young women with a fascination toward mythology, Lotus, a sharp-tongued computer wizard who apparently dresses with questionable clothing, Seven, a giant man with amnesia, Ace, the calm minded adult of the group, Santa, the obligatory Take-No-S***-From-Nobody character and the siblings Clover and Snake.    999 has a total of 6 endings to it. More like 3 \\"Bad\\" endings, a prelude ending, a completely infuriating ending, and the True Ending. The only real problem to 999 is that to get the True Ending, you must get the Prelude ending first, or otherwise you will wind up getting a large \\"To be Continued\\" screen and then the credits coming right after. 999 loves hints, it will even give you a hint to obtain the true end. So its a must to play this game multiple times.    999 is an embroiling adventure with a serious plot and one of the best casts of characters to grace in a video game. It is a game that sticks with you, and generates a massive hole in which only another game like this can fill.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Item as expected! Greatly appreciated... Not much more I can say at this point but it seems this comment requires a certain amount of words?! =/
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|could use some minor tweaking- the first word is always given away because it is capitalized. also the buttons are just a little too small... but overall a great fun way to learn!
B001N3GUIE|1.0|I read much praise for this movie in reviews on the internet and in published articles.  Plus, I expected much with Leslie Nielson in this movie.<br /><br />This is a good science fiction movie when compared to many others from the 1950s.  It did not live up to my expectations based on the many favorable reviews, and I was greatly disappointed.  I do not recommend this movie.
031624662X|5.0|Ancillary Justice starts with a bang and keeps going at an engaging clip all the way through.  The book is an incredible mix of action, intrigue, and a good dose of the mildly unexplainable.  I haven't read a better Space Opera or even Science Fiction book in years.  To think that this is Ann Leckie's first book makes my mind whorl at the thought of what her next book will be like.  This work is amazing and everyone who has ever even thought they liked Science Fiction should read it.  The characters, setting, and even the action sequences are so well laid out and structured that if I was going to teach a how to course in writing Science Fiction or ANY genre fiction I would use this book as my prime example.  I loved the book from beginning to end.  I would venture to say that John Scalzi's throne might be threatened as greatest science fiction writer of the 21st century.  I cannot wait to see what Ann Leckie writes next.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King ever since I could read. I used to read my mom's books. Then, I started buying my own. I have never ever ever been disappointed by a Stephen King , story or movie. Although the books are ALWAYS better.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Breaking from the winning formula of the first 2 Hangover movies, this one is barely funny at all.  Glad I only wasted $4 to rent it instead of $20 going to the theater, but the time wasted watching it is gone forever.  I only recommend watching this if (a) it costs you nothing and (b) you are very very bored.

B00CBKLO52|4.0|this game is cool if you like planes. You can change into a boat, helecopter, and plane. you can do tricks, mess around, etc...I recomend this game to any kid that likes boats, or flying things.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I love how this book takes the view of the little girl in heaven, looking down after her family. How her family is shaped and torn by her death, the search for evidence and Mr Harvey the fast forward to the maturity of sussie' s friends and family, as she goes through their lives with them, desperately trying to communicate until the faithful day she falls to earth
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|A lot of reviews were disheartening. Most of them feeling disappointed in the book but mostly the ending. It was better than I expected after reading the reviews. It kept my interest. However...it had a lot of filler. You'd get to something riveting, then a lot of wasted time spent on useless information. It's a sad book but a realistic depiction of what would happen during war. I'm thrilled she chose Peta. I am disappointed that the Author felt that this was the time to skip a chunk  of the story and skip ahead. Why deprive us of the part we are most interested in and waste a  ton of time  throughout the rest of the book?

B00FAX6XQC|1.0|It would freeze up my screen and would not let me play it was so bad i was sad i really wanted to play it :(
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My son and I both have this game...I was going to play so we could compare and talk about it but I am hooked- playing on my own! Engaging game.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great Value for Money<br />Easy Setup<br />Only Challenge is the HDMI extender cable is a bit too short, could've worked with longer extender.<br />Chrome however does not play your regular videos from the computer ... so need to figure that out.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|WWZ is a refreshing zombie movie for both fans and non fans alike, the graphics and special effects really add to the story-telling.
B0016J81B4|5.0|Comfy and grips well in the kitchen. To all bussers, cooks, and waiters, consider these if you want something light weight and comfy
B007SGM084|5.0|Love, love, love this series!<br /><br />Can't wait for them to pick a new Christian Grey for the movie!<br /><br />Go fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the game hate being on the board for a long time.  the game is additive and loads of fun.  can't put it down.-
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I installed this on my Kindle Fire HD so I can adjust the tones of different music I like to listen to.  It is a great little app.  Lets you amp up the bass for some music and up the others when you want to listen to voice.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|It's a nice, easy to read book that provides a reasonable rationale for fasting. It certainly inspired me to give fasting a go. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is simply because there were some inconsistencies in the book and I found I , as a health professional, wanted a greater scientific explanation for some aspects. However the lack of scientific depth also made it easier to read. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to improve their health or lose weight.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I haven't had the app long enough to appreciate it but I loved the color and design and the specifications . I have read favorable reviews and decided. Why not! I will make a new comment after I have experienced the forementioned attributes. Thanks for the free-bee!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Ok...good for all ages. It works on the kindle with no problems.  I can play it with my friends. Everyone enjoys playing UNO .  Would recommend it for younger age though.
B00168ML1G|5.0|Movie was as listed and already viewed.  Please with transactions, movie was enjoyed and added to my Ironman collection.  No dislikes.  Is a good movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally got the game on my kindle! Played it on my computer but wanted it for my kindle fire. Now I play it more often. Thank you Amazon for listening to people to get this game!
B005H9B2CE|5.0|love thor and all the avengers! Can't wait for the next one coming out in november. Will definetly see it.
B000TEVIMQ|4.0|I never thought I liked Jethro Tull way back when!  I started hearing some of the songs on Sirius XM, not realizing before that these songs were sung by Jethro Tull.  So I purchased this &#34;album&#34;.  I really enjoyed most of the songs, but there were a few that I didn't recognize.  I'm sure once I hear them a few more times, I will enjoy these also.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Waste of time!  This movie stinks.  Can't believe their making another one.  Not scary, horrible script, plot holes everywhere and most of all, bad acting!
B00F2J2LRE|5.0|This album is as good as it gets.  Cher still has it, and her voice is just as good as years ago!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Hope I we are not too late. I am very excited and  optimistic to practice the concepts the rest of my life
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can finally play my favorite game on my beloved Kindle.  The colors are kind of muted compared to the iPhone 5 but it is still a great, highly addictive game.
B0054JELTI|5.0|I am very pleased with the order and the arrival of this items, no damage what so ever, I will buy more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game trying to get that limited board.  Its awesome and gets really hard as u go farther in the hame
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. Glad I don't have to play it on phone anymore.<br /> Really enjoying it on my kindle. Long time voming
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I have seen this movie about 5 times. It is one of the better Bruce Willis movies with a great cast of stars. It has everything, drama,comedy, suspense and action. I want to see the new sequel.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|They just keep getting better!! Can't wait to plunge into the next Night Huntress! Such a joyous plunder into other worldly pleasures, a new obsession!! Love it.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|A beautiful collection of pictures that reinvigorates your love for the greatest city in the world and for the humanity that defines it.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|I love J. Cole. I've seen him perform and it made me decide to actually purchase a real CD, I haven't done that in a while. I was bummed that the CD came with a crack in it (I bought it specifically for him to sign at a meet and greet), but I can just find an old CD and switch them out. Either way, Born Sinner is an amazing album, he got me hooked, I'm a fan!
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This series is definitely a must see.  The cast members are awesome.  All of them shine in their own right as well as contributing to the whole.  Definitely not for those under 18 years old though.  Good Friday night date night show.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This game is so addicting!! I have been plating it for a while. if you like planting I would totally get this game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY Candy Crush is available on the Kindle! I play on my Android and PC. Now I can play on my Kindle. Love this game! Very addicting....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Yay! I am so happy that candy crush is now available on kindle fire. I now don't have to go on the iPad just to play. It seems like there is a little glitch causing pauses during moves.
B0002NIRIC|5.0|This is a great value. One bottle has lasted me a year and I use it daily. A light coating makes the strings last longer and play better (your fingers glide more easily).
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Not sure how to review this, I got what I expected when I ordered it. It was in good condition, the discs played fine. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the walking dead.
0634022296|5.0|This is a comprehensive set of music for the couch strummer to enjoy.  I say couch strummer because as has been pointed out in other reviews, this has no lead tabs or notated music.  This is basically the kind of chord and lyric only arrangement you would find on the internet for couch or campfire strumming sing a longs.  Of course, unlike the internet, this is correct, complete, in the original key, and not overly simplified.  One will however have to know both open and  barre chords to use this book.  There are nice chord diagram boxes on every page to go with every song.<br /><br />I would say this is a book for the beginning intermediate player and above and a great choice if you need some songs to practice your barre chord work.  It certainly has provided me with enjoyable material to work on my E and A shaped barre chords.  It's really fun to play along with the mp3 of the original songs too.<br /><br />Having a huge collection of songs in one book has a down side.  It is ridiculously hard to use even with a good music stand.  It simply won't stay open at times and would have been a good candidate for spiral binding.  I photo copy the song I am using or working on.  Some others have removed the binding and spiral bound it.  What a pain, but worth it to have correct chords to every Beatles song (and there are tons of them) for so cheap and so neatly done too.
B00ANKV70O|5.0|I had to replace my old clown-shoe looking-alike crocs and I looked for a while so I found these. They are as comfortable as Crocs but pretty.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|It seemed a bit like tuning in later in the season, but I'm excited to see what is going to go on next.
B005ES5Y4U|5.0|These are very pretty shoes. I was looking for a replacement for my old Crocs. Comfortable but reminded me of clown shoes. I found these they are comfortable and pretty. I am very pleased.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints!  I could hardly put the book down. I think I've read almost every book he's written and this one ranks right up there as one of my favorites.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|A prefect movie if you want to experience a variety of emotions! It reinforces my belief in mankind and proves that we can rise above things that seem at first to be obstacles.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the movies love the game. My whole family has the game. I would recommend this game to everyone. Plus it is free.
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|This is a good enough game but the in app purchases are outrageous. You have to buy virtually everything and it is VERY expensive. Buyer beware!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Great game. I would recommend it. It will make you want to play it until you beat it, then you will say is that all I get for free. Yes.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This was a gripping story.  At times the brutality made it hard to read, but wow!  It was very powerful.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|This is a brilliant description of the second world war because of its scope, starting with the sino-Japanese war, and his ability to find factual anecdotes to draw you into the overall story.  I think his opening story about the Corean who found himself fighting in nearly all theaters drew me into the narrative as no other historybook has done.<br /><br />If you want to read just one book about WW II this is the one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for kindle to get the real candy crush saga. They had a few knock offs that were terrible. So very excited it's finally here. Such an awesome game!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Not all battles were fought with rifles and cannons. This book give an account of the political battle and one man's clear vision<br />'
B008X9I6X8|2.0|The story is about a Caesar of Rome who is kind of nuts and he spends his days around sex and cruelty. I wanted to see the movie through the years and finally decided to rent it with my girlfriend. Honestly, the movie is a time waster and if you want to see movies with sex then rent porn.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really liked this book. This new series is great. I would expect nothing better from Rick Riordan. Amazing author!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|If you're a GG follower, this final season delivers everything you want and hoped for! All your questions are answered :)
B005EHILV4|5.0|First of all, I needed to mix my e-drum kit sounds from my PC (using Toontrack) with background music from a different output. This worked just as I wanted.<br /><br />The driver ASIO4ALL owns the USB sound card from the Behringer 302USB and the Windows Media takes ownership of the laptop's sound card. Both are mixed by the Behringer and produce a nice sound, just as I want on my headphones or speakers. I can also control the brightness and bass of my e-drum kit, btw its a Medeli DD518DX.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This book plodded along carrying on the same theme from the other stories but leaving the reader unsatisfied at the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very,  very addictive game. It is simple yet challenging.  Each level has a goal to accomplish in so many moves.  So much fun!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I was truly disappointed in how short Fruit Drops I was but this makes up for it.  I've been playing it on the hard level and it is not easy getting through the levels.  I love a challenge and so far this game is it!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive game. I am finally glad that I can play this on my kindle and still connects with Facebook.
B0011Z31V8|5.0|CD spans 2 decades of Prince, his many collaborations andmany styles.  Loved that it included the song Diamonds and Pearls. I sing along with pretty much all songs while at work.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|Got this for a trip I was going on to S Dakota for the buffalo round up. Needed something to keep me busy since they don't stampede on time. Great movie and colors..Watch it again & again
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|I thought there would've been more exciting action in a season opener.  About 15 min of action and the rest is drama.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There's a lot to love in this book. You get to see how Dan (adult Danny) copes in the world with his Shining gift. He uses booze to suppress it for many years, then kicks the habit and starts using it to help elderly patients with their final moments on earth. He also begins helping another psychic girl who's being preyed upon by other psychics. Am about half-way through, but King does not disappoint with this one. The story is told from an older, wiser, and more sober King. That is reflected in Dan's past and his character within Doctor Sleep. It's a grown-up surreal, other worldly ecosystem that's very engaging to read.
B00CDBZ6NA|4.0|Very good resent history of nuclear risks and the cold war between Us and USSR. One hopes that the control of nuclear weapons worldwide will be better today
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King has some great books I love: The Shining, Carrie, Duma Key, Under the Dome, Doctor Sleep. I love the point of view switching that goes on in The Shining, switching from Jack to Danny to the Mother. You get to see the madness from all points of view. It's not like the movie, really, although the plot is similar. The symbolism in the book is more specific to the evil within the hotel itself and how it lures Jack further into madness. The movie was good too, but in a different way. One of my all-time favorite King books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best  game ever! It is totally worth the $6.99. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!
B005L12SH6|5.0|I love EWF!!! what a nice collection!! I would've only hope for plastic jewel casing on each cd but I am happy either way!!
0812983459|5.0|While reading this book you became entralled with the characters and we're rooting them on, hoping they'd complete their journey.  Harold's mission became as important to me, the reader, as it was to him.<br />I enjoyed how the author wove their married history and turmoils into the progress of the story.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Big fan of this author and have read all previous books. Very topical highlighting problems of living in Afghanistan at any time
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Very disappointed.  This movie lost its way quickly, and it's a shame, as the actors are all great notwithstanding.  Of particular concern was the irrelevant scenes obviously pieced together to fill the 90 minutes necessary to complete this movie.  Confusing and without direction, the fact most people are giving this five stars makes me question their sanity and expectations of Hollywood.
B002U3CCKQ|2.0|Prob two stars I felt down while reading it and some of the characters and their behaviours were degrading. Didn't really like it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is awesome because you can catch animals and I disappeared from my singing monsters university and I fought for interrupting the voice of America because it is awesome
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for this app for my Kindle Fire for so long. Thank you!  Its so much easier to play than on my phone.  unlike other reviews, I have not encountered any problems playing it.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|bought 2 of these for family--both said it works well. a bit clunky to take out in public (plus it looks like a sex toy).
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Some Reacher readers apparently expect perfection every time.  I've enjoyed them all, pretty much equally, even the ones with an occasional factual error, even the ones with too much left-wing political BS.  Basically I enjoy characters who do what's right even when it's risky.  Certainly that describes Jack Reacher.  I enjoy characters who see a wrong and try to right it. That's Reacher.  I enjoy characters who both think and act.  Reacher.  This series is on a par with the John D. MacDonald Travis McGee series, and that's high praise.  I'll be sadly disappointed when the last Reacher novel is written, assuming I live that long.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I found this movie to be entertaining, although the plot was somewhat predictable.  So many movies today rely on nonstop action to keep our interest and don't give any insight into how this alternate world works.  This movie at least tried to show us the culture underlying the story.
B003730LRY|5.0|watching it with my 8 year old daughter who is seeing it for the first time. its still a wonderful movie she thinks its really funny
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just starting this story took me right back to the Overlook! Winnie,Danny and Dick all over again! SK's best since Duma Key!
B009369Z8A|5.0|This movie, previously unheard of by me, has become a favorite of mine, and introduced me to Tom Hardy.  I found the major stars to be outstanding in their portrayals of these earthy characters.  I will definitely follow Tom Hardy's career.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Not as good as the first two, but did enjoy it never the less.  Loved the end in the room with the guys after the party
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This book despite its incredible scientific discourse was an amazing in-depth novel of humanity. Alma Whitaker's story and of her journey through a life of science was an amazing read. Elizabeth Gilbert's finest work to date.
B001S49AQW|5.0|Love this book!  Sweet young heroine is continually rescued from scrapes  by her husband and his friends. Husband is finally fed up and the friends hide her from her husband until he comes to his senses and realizes he loves her. Primarily takes place in London and Bath. Fun to read about newlyweds decorating and furnishing their London townhome. This book uses LOTS of cant phrases so I do not recommend it as a first Heyer novel.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|GREAT. I like how large the numbers are. Easy to use. Never go a  month without calculating my bills LOVE this app.
B002WWKZJK|4.0|Endearing girl with a stutter marries Earl and takes the ton by storm with her gambling, flirting and lively behavior. She flirts with her husband's nemesis and gets into trouble when that rake tries to abduct her. Her husband comes to the rescue of her reputation. Also enjoyed the loyal relationship between the heroine and her brother.
B00AFEY7QO|5.0|I was totally satisfied with just listening to the music. With the view included, it's like being in your home, stretched out on a couch, being entertained by a magical music magician group, who's got you rocked into a daze.
B001POX73C|3.0|Promising start with Freddy as a very likeable hero. But the story gets so caught up in other characters that it forgets to develop the character of the heroine. We sense that she's good, but never really feel it.<br /><br />ETA: I just re-read this book to refresh my memory of why it isn't a favorite for me. What I feel is missing is the development of the relationship between Freddy and Kitty and the reasons are two-fold. Primarily, the book loses focus and pursues the development of the secondary relationships between Hannah Plymstock with Lord Dolphington and between Olivia with Camille. This made me feel like I was experiencing ADD.....here, look at this relationship over here, no, look at this one, oooh shiny thing. The second missing element is any internal monologue of feelings from Kitty or Freddy. Heyer shows us their growing fondness for each other, but we never get a peek inside their heads or hearts so it's hard to experience them falling in love.<br /><br />In addition to the missing relationship development of the main characters, there are a number of secondary characters whom I didn't like and the book spends quite a bit of time on. I really dislike Jack and became sick of reading about him. Hugh was a prosy know-it-all and I didn't even like Meg very much. These characters detracted from the story for me.<br /><br />Being Georgette Heyer, this book is still better than many books you could choose to read and I wouldn't disuade you from trying it. But there are other Heyer's I would recommend first:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004Y5AV4M Venetia (Regency Romances)]] - best romance<br />[[ASIN:1402214766 Frederica (Regency Romances)]] - best all around, best family, best humor<br />[[ASIN:1402210795 Friday's Child (Regency Romances)]] - best coming of age<br />[[ASIN:1402213492 Regency Buck (Regency Romances)]] - best descriptions of Prinny, Brummell and Brighton<br />[[ASIN:1402213506 Charity Girl (Regency Romances)]] - best hero<br />[[ASIN:B002WWKZMM The Grand Sophy (Regency Romances)]] - best heroine<br />[[ASIN:1402219539 Devil's Cub (Historical Romances)]] - best scene (between Duke of Avon and heroine), best abduction<br />[[ASIN:1402219474 These Old Shades (Historical Romances)]] - best revenge<br />[[ASIN:B004M8S45E The Foundling]] - best travel adventure, duke in disguise<br />[[ASIN:B004OEIDBQ Masqueraders]] - best swashbucklingDevil's Cub (Historical Romances)]] - best scene (between Duke of Avon and heroine), best abduction [[ASIN:1402219474 These Old Shades (Historical Romances)]] - best revenge [[ASIN:B004M8S45E The Foundling]] - best travel adventure, duke in disguise [[ASIN:B004OEIDBQ Masqueraders]] - best swashbuckling
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Although I am not a Tom Cruise fan,  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Adapted from an excellent book,  Tom Cruise does an excellent job wit this role even though he does not fit the physical characteristics of the character from the novel.  After renting it,  I bought it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does its job wonderfully. There are so many options including my favorite volume crescendo, where it will start out quiet and get louder so you don't have to wake up to a blaring annoyance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would rate this in my top 5 all time games.  But be forewarned,  it is a time eater. Enjoy it at your own risk.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is awesome.I have been playing it for two years and its like the best game ever in history!I even got a double rainbow dragon.People buy the game now it is worth it
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I liked it better than the first and second ones. Funny one-liners, interesting characters and a great plot line. Good ending too
0744014956|5.0|I ordered this book for my husband and within 3 days I got it! Thank you for sending it so fast. I hope this helps some how. Game on.
B009V3KKXY|3.0|At the beginning you have used  different colored cords to make it easier to understand what you were trying to show.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It was well written, and the content was fascinating.  I also enjoyed the photos, the extra notes, and the study guide.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|This is the kind of movie you should watch when you’re feeling down. It’s so joyfully magical and the story is so simple and heartwarming.<br /><br />Ponyo immediately gave me the feeling of an old classic Disney film such as Pinocchio. The music is gorgeous with one very cute theme in particular, but a little old-fashioned at times. The song during the opening credits actually sounds operatic.<br /><br />The colors are very bright, but the animation is a bit simpler than usual Ghibli fare. I like the way the characters are illustrated, whether they are being portrayed in a natural light or in a comically odd one. But the art is not always what it could be. There is a lot of water in this movie, but it does not look very real or very beautiful; the simplified light reflections and the lack of shine make it look a little too cartoony.<br /><br />Ponyo does lack a weighty element like the one that made My Neighbor Totoro more emotionally engaging, but the characters and the way they live are hardly less real. Like most Studio Ghibli films, Ponyo is full of those natural moments where you recognize yourself in the characterizations on the screen.<br /><br />The second half does get a little nonsensical, but I think that Ponyo is the kind of story that can be best enjoyed by children, who don’t always require a perfect plot framework to appreciate the fun moments that make this movie so special. This is the kind of movie that I wished I could have watched when I was a little kid.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|Great movie, you won't expect the end, it has a good twist but I liked the illusionist way better lol.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so awesome I am like a pro it is really easy to figure it out and I love the zombies and the awesome graphics so neat I actually think u will love it derp
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!! It's addictive and helps pass by time. I can see what level my Facebook friends are on and brag about be pass them. I am happy amazon finally has candy crush saga
B000FC13Y0|5.0|A wonderful story. It was refreshing to read a book that was paced and perfectly told from beginning to end. You just have to read it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game! tons of items to find! really makes the game so much more appealling. I play these games all the time and this one is by far my favorite!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After listening to my family/friends talk about how fun and addictive this game was for months now I was so excited when I saw that this app was finally available in the Amazon appstore.  I have been waiting so long to play this on my Kindle Fire HD and it definitely did not disappoint.  Now I can join in on the fun too! I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout has a profound sense of clarity in not only her view of the world and what is possible, but in her manner of sharing that view. She is humorous, intelligent and thought provoking, as is her book!<br />The exercises and insights are simple and profound, just like Life itself! I recommend this book to EVERYONE who can read! (And read it to those who can't!) ENJOY!!! With my love, Marilyn
B00715RI16|5.0|I love this movie! Nothing like scaring yourself in the middle of the night right before bed! If you haven't seen it yet you have to watch it (at night). Excellent quality of course and a great movie.
B007REV4T8|2.0|Has a good Bond, a good villian and a well done intro.<br /><br />This movie had what it took to be one of the best 007 movies ever.<br /><br />But alas, the last half is an afterthought.  About 3/4 of the way through, we didn't even care what happened and just wanted it to end.<br /><br />Recommendation:  watch it till they get to 'Skyfall', then turn it off.
B00825921I|3.0|Daphne du Maurier is an expert at creating pictures and emotions of a location and time in her writing. She relates a wonderful story about an actual location with realistic characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Helps to remind you to think outside the box and still be logical. The levels and difficulty progress smoothly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My opinion for this game has its ups and downs,subway surfers, is a really fun game,but it has a lot of ads,2nd of all,the new characters cost sooooooo much! But this game is great for all ages, I recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Need pet rescue sage now please get it soon can not wait why did it take so long to get
B005XT4932|5.0|Loved the 1984 movie, named after a Springstein 1978 track from his Darkness On the Edge of Town album. The music is Hard rocking, adding so much to all the action in the movie.  A fun time with this great soundtrack.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Such an amazing app I would recommend it for anyone who likes killing stuff<br />Don't wait to get this all, best thing ever
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app works like a charm. I wish I could say the same for my kindle.  very easy to use
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|UI love this game!!!!!!!  WAIT!!!!!!!  I'm showing all the signs of addiction.... must play more candy crush it's to enjoyable to stop I know when to stop but at the same time I don't...
0307278255|4.0|this book was bought as a gift for a friend, who requested  it, so I cannot make any personal comment.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I haven't played it enough to give it the 5 stars, however, what I did play was entertaining and fun!  I would enjoy better directions on how to play.
B00FK04JY8|4.0|I'm a fan of her voice but not the musical style she's chosen...but then again I'm kinda old for this!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is amazing  I saw my dad play it on his phone and when I found it on kindle I tried it now I am addicted I just wish u could use your money to buy energy
159463176X|1.0|The book would best be described as a collection of short stories. There are a couple of chapters (story lines) where there's a significant overlap, but for the most part, the main character in one story has only a peripheral connection to the main character in another. Too many characters were introduced with no significant connection to the brother and sister, who are the main characters. A couple of story lines could have been omitted entirely. For this reason, I found the book disappointing, disjointed, and difficult to follow at times. However, if you approach the book as a collection of short stories, you won't be disappointed. Mr. Hosseini is a great writer; even poetic at times.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Keeping it simple. Easy setup, no draining your battery, excellent playback quality, fast enough. I'm not a TV guy but since I got Chromecast I use it almost every day.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|One of the better books from a master story teller in the recent years. Definitely worth reading. Better than his last books The Cobra and The Afghan.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Made me think a lot more about how fragile our existence is; so depended on this fine tuned machine that supplies us all with food and protection, a civilisation built upon hollow comforts.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|its a good game and everything but its not made for kindle. there's parts where you have to blow but the screen doesn't pick that up. also occaisonally the screen wont pick up your finger and there is a time limit. all and all its a good game but modifications need to be made for this to be a five star kindle game.
0321344758|5.0|This isn't just another book for web designers. This is a book for anyone interested in making their web site work. That includes the client. It explains, in very clear terms, why some of our &#34;great ideas&#34; are not so good after all, and why understanding things from the customer's point of view and experience is more important than ever.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I bought the book because of the reviews. After reading it I'm<br />Glad I did.  I read it in one sitting. Not so much a spine tumbler<br />but a great b read with b plenty of twists
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addictive! &#34;Gotta Stop! Gotta Stop!&#34;  Not really a gamer but how can you stop playing this game? To much fun!
0345803493|5.0|This was a wonderful second book to the first one. I'm just now on chapter 5 of the 3rd book. lol I have bee reading them SOOO fast. I have always loved reading but I honestly havent found many books that I can just sit and read and keep buying the next one after that. I'm totally satisfied with this book and its trilogies. wrote by: VERY HAPPY READER :)
B005GG0MIS|4.0|What saves this book is it has a unique point of view, discussing how presidents used past presidents to help them, and how past presidents attempted to influence the sitting president. That brings it up to 4 stars.<br /><br />The quality of the writing is 3 stars. Not bad but not compelling.<br /><br />It skipped a lot. If some of the presidents made no use of their predecessors, say so rather than just skipping that period.<br /><br />Put this in the category of ok to read, but no loss if you don't read it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great for all ages. I like that it is like a mixture of subway surfers, temple run and coin jump all in one game. You never get bored and the challenges keep you on your toes. I lovveeee this game.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|I am in the choir, firmly convinced that on the eve of what will possibly be an extended drought in many parts of the world, we are permanently, not only poisoning billions of gallons of water, but also placing it where it will come up to contaminate living things. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the presentation might be too artsy to get the serious attention of those who elevate jobs jobs jobs and drill baby drill over the long term ability of the earth to support life.
0321714113|2.0|The explanations range from pretty good to impenetrable. The examples are decent I guess, but for the most part are one liners where you get variations of right and wrong answers lined up together. No answers to any of the exercises.<br /><br />Though it has a very nice looking cover and the internal layout is nice, the way the authors are attempting to teach C++ is completely dry. I never got the feeling I was being lead to any type of conclusion, just being given the shortest possible explanation of feature after feature until finally the end of chapter. Trying to get through this from Chapter 1, I remember the existential horror of starting a new chapter and praying to God it would be over soon. By the time I started the next chapter all I could remember was fear - and consequently very few of the concepts, which the authors attempted to drill into my skull with their repetitive and cryptic one-liners.<br /><br />Obviously this book is not a self-study introduction to C++, even for someone already fluent in another programming language except C or C# I guess.<br /><br />I would suggest Sams Teach Yourself C++ in One Hour a Day (7th Edition) by Siddhartha Rao. See my review there.<br /><br />Maybe when I finish that book I can come back to the Primer and it will serve as a good review.
0062255657|3.0|This book was a quick read - certainly on the shorter side of \\"novel\\".  I enjoyed it while I read it, but at the same time, I think part of the reason I read it so quickly was that I was trying to get to the magic that I expected to find.  The book never quite reached the level of \\"Neverwhere\\" or \\"American Gods\\". I think one of the big problems is that 90% of the book is actually just a flashback.  The narrator returns home for a funeral and while visiting childhood locations is drawn to a place that triggers forgotten memories.  So, it's being told by someone that is just remembering these things - there's no tension, no worry about what's going to happen.  And because of that, the book loses something.<br /><br />The story is an interesting story, I liked the Hempstocks, but the story would have been better told from a \\"currently happening\\" perspective.  I liked how despite trying to fix things, innocent child mistakes kept making things worse.<br /><br />I think the biggest disappointment is the lack of impact on the main character - in every other Neil Gaiman book, the main character winds up changed forever from their interaction with the supernatural world. In this book the main character doesn't even remember what happened until he returned to the pond, and so it has no impact on his life.  This left a bit of a empty feeling in me when I reached the end and realized I was done.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Considered one of the greatest sci fi novels ever written, Ender's Game certainly has staying power in the past few decades.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|I'D say I love it!!! Im glad i did not read the book because people are saying the book is a lot more better than the movie... I will still give this film 5 stars for a zombie film. Im looking forward for the Part II.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best game ever I have this game on facebook and I am on level 147 and you can even connect this game to Facebook and so you don't have to start at level one.  GET THIS GAME NOT KIDDING IT IS THE BEST
0062082353|5.0|This Hard-bound with Cover book shows no Wear.  The story runs through his diary accounts.  He acts as his own Forward Observer in directing fire like in Artillery.  He covers Ammo,  Rifle, Scope & Camo.  He learns how to act being attached to Units.  The training of Breath control and trigger letoff are made second-nature.  He becomes a one-man SWAT team in the Military.  First he learns--later he shares with his junior acolytes.  His regrets are about men who he could not save.  He gives thanks to his publisher W. Morrow as enabler.  Autobiography-2012 is followed by his demise not in Combat. I as trained in Artillery US Army 1967 & Gave a lesson on Sniper Training FM.  Also we studied Camo/Infiltration per FM.  I was top new shooter,  winning .45  CG National Trophy Team Match where we used all the tricks in our book.  In 8TH Grade I won top Score in NRA(LIFE Member) Junior Indoor .22 Prone, Sitting, and Standing.  So Maybe this book had Commonality for me.  Good Shooting.  DAS  Old 70YR Soldier.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book, It Was really hard to put down. I really loved the twist at the end.. I would recommend this book...
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great movie. It was very heartwarming and made me tear up towards the end. I didn't expect much from this movie but it was very creative in terms of the animals and landscape and I love their message about not hiding, not being afraid, living (instead of just surviving) and ultimately, chasing the light. Love it!
B0071MDA2U|5.0|I read this book in 1 day because I was so interested. The whole story itself is amazing. Although it is a little confusing at the start, I love the way it all comes together at the finish! This is a must read!!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this app. I don't need it for anything but the most basic calculations, but I really like the large display--so easy to see and operate.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read - a few twists and turns that I had figured out before the end but still enjoyable to read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive and fun! Simple control and nice profession on prizes. Great entertainment for anyone, and doesn't require network connection to enjoy
B000003CUJ|1.0|this is presented as a musical version of the operas, but in reality each entry  is only about 5-10 seconds long.  Do NOT buy this!  J. Pennington
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I use to be a candy crush addict. I bought a new kindle fire HD &amp; the app wasn't available so it wasn't fun playing on my phone &amp; didn't want to carry around my laptop. So thank you king.com &amp; kindle for finally making this game available on kindle fire HD!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|So far I'm enjoying the game, the graphics are really good and it's good for killing  some time. I would suggest it to friends.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Love the characters and the actors in this.  Mental illness is a tough thing to deal with and I thought the movie handled it beautifully.  Some of us have dealt with these things in our own families and it is not a laughing matter, however, again, beautifully handled in this move.
0679805273|5.0|My daughter just graduated with her masters... Very fitting, book. Ohh the places she will go......Great book for anyone and any age.<br />Thank you !
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was rush...omitted details like the ones given on first (hunger games) and second (catching fire) books. Otherwise just fine.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great read. It was romantic, sexy and mesmerizing. I can't wait to read what happens next.  So much was left to be resolved.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am very excited and pleased with facebook.  Both of my daughters are hearing impaired.  Facebook allows me to talk back and forth<br />with them when i'm out of the country without costing me a fortune in text messaging fees.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story is about us all, which may be why I loved it so much, as it told me more about myself and humanity.  Liane has a unique gift of painting her characters so vividly and humanely it cannot help but touch the reader.  I cannot remember reading anything I enjoyed as much and learned so much about myself while reading.
0385743564|4.0|Steelheart is a good amalgam of post-apocalyptic and  superhero themes. In this world, there are people that have gained superpowers to various degrees and are called \\"Epics\\". These super-powered folks unlike acting like superheroes, have become power-mad despots. One such Epic who calls himself Steelheart rules over Chicago, which after he has altered completely and is now called \\"Newcago\\". Steelheart rules with a steelfist and tolerates no opposition from the general populace or for any competing Epics.<br /><br />Sanderson presents a compelling narrative by having a main protagonist out for revenge who has no superpowers, just his determination & quest to find to the truth. Usually Sanderson has no problems with characterization and even in this one, we get more than an interesting side-cast. The story ends on a powerful note & readers will be hooked on to this new series by one of the most prolific writers of this generation.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|One of those shows where you couldn't wait to see the next installment.  It had everything.  Drama, suspense, romance, and a little comedy.  One of my most favorite shows.

B0065GC0BA|5.0|Fabulous characters and a great story with plenty of twists and turns.  This one is likely to make you laugh and cry.
0743526937|5.0|great
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a complex jewel  game with lots of levels and it has this  limited amount of social interaction of helping your friends.

B0091MXJ6K|5.0|An overall superb album comprising all the most recent work from UK World-Famous DJ Calvin Harris as well as collaborative tracks with artists such as Ne-Yo, Example and Ellie Goulding
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is the only game I only play on my kindle!! Fun GAME to play on the go (or in the middle of class)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book!  I got it for my 11 year old daughter.  She begged me to read it too and it continues to be passed around the family.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Starts out full of action and on the edge of your seat, fantastic! Then it gets a bit predictable, and is anti-climatic.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved the movie but the book is better. I don't know what the book is based on - definitely not this book. My teenage son recommended the book and I am glad that he did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that Candy Crush is finally on the Kindle. I will definitely run the battery dead playing this.
B004OT2WKO|5.0|The best, lego always meet spectations, the power functions lot of fun and intersting how the work. My family and I just love it
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I have to say that I really enjoy this app and play it every single day. I think that some changes could be made, but other than that, it's a very great app and I can enjoy it around others. I do not have to hide it from my younger siblings that are too young to see some of the things in the world. My siblings can sometimes help me with it too! This is a wonderful app that I play every day and plan to do this for as long as I can and believe I will.
1476727651|2.0|I like Stephen King novels and love The Shining.  What I liked about this novel are the allusions to the original story.  I particularly liked the calling out of particularities in the book that call out differences between the movie and film (which King refers to as a \\"Kubrick Film, not a King book\\").  There are a lot of good references to the original story in this, and the nostalgia for the original novel really does bring a smile to your face as you read it.<br /><br />That said, this story sucks.  There is no imminent sense of dread or fear for the heroes.  Whereas the Overlook was both a sense of isolation and empowerment over its potential victims, there is nothing in this book the protagonists are trying to escape from.  Which brings us to the villains...while they could have been truly frightening, instead he makes them laughable caricatures--like trying to scare you with a band of Tea Party nuts, which isn't scary at all. And by making the primary hero (Abra Stone) virtually \\"Shining Omnipotent\\" why should we feel scared of these quacks?<br /><br />All in all, all it makes you want to do is re-read the original.  In fact, that's not a bad idea. Its a much better book.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Need to be able to connect to facebook. It's pointless if you can't play with neighbors. Need to fix it. Let me know if anyone knows how
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story line is authentic,  The telling is extremely well written, drawing a reader in until the very end. EXCELLENT!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I'm addicted to this I love this game. Just wish I knew how REMOVE the trucks from getting stuck when TOO many a PUT inside the business on accident.
B008JFURII|5.0|I liked the sequel as much or more than the first!  Lots of action, good plot and good laughs!  There's just no more to say... if you saw Red then you ABSOLUTELY MUST MUST MUST see Red 2.  You cannot go wrong!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This is my first time reading one of Lois Lowry's books and I was not disappointed. I love reading stories about dystopian societies and I think this story was amazing.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I find the human element of the story most interesting and disagree with the critics who say that the children don't behave like children.  For those of us who spent 10+ years waiting to have a real life and be done with &#34;school&#34; the thoughts are not that different.  It's quite an interesting view from a speculative point of view.  The &#34;desks&#34; in the story are quite obviously today's iPads.  However, the Internet is a surprisingly different thing.  Card's model is more like traditional publishing, such as the New York Times, Washington Post, etc being the prime importance in the network and failed to predict the anarchic world of the rogue blogger, Wikileaks, the banality of the dominance of celebrity culture, etc.  It is a stark and militaristic world, but not entirely too far away from where we were headed, if all things remained equal.  Can't believe it took me this long to get around to reading it.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|I'm looking forward to many more great reads from Ms. Zimmerman.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to the genre or anyone who enjoys a touching romance.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I read this book prior to seeing the movie World War Z because I always like to read the book first.  With this book and movie, I needn't have bothered with my rules.  The two are not remotely alike--not even enough for a \\"based on\\" label.<br /><br />The book is a little different in that it doesn't have a main character or really even a plot. The book is written by Max Brooks as if he were simply a reporter recording this for history's sake.  It is a series of interviews he conducts.  Many different characters are simply telling their history around a centralized theme:  the zombie apocalypse.  It's a different kind of book to read, but once I got used to it, I liked it.  The flow is abrupt and sudden, just like watching a news documentary.  It is about the \\"Zombie War\\", but really just the aftereffects, after the zombies have almost totally eradicated life on earth and how some humans survived this plague.  Much of the book is told through \\"official channels\\", so it has that dry fact feeling, except that it's about the zombie plague.  It starts out with an epidemiologist who wants to trace the plague back to the original source, to patient zero.<br /><br />Taken independently, the book and movie are quite good. If you try and mesh the two together, it's a mess for the brain to figure out.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Could not put it down.  I highly recommend it.  I could hardly believe the way people were treated back then.

1250006341|5.0|I received it by mail within the time frame that was promised.  Packaging was adequate to protect book from harm.  Book exactly as described. Loved the book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for a long time for Candy Crush to be available on Kindle Fire and it's finally here and as great as I expected it to be.  Absolutely one of the best (and most addictive) games - if you haven't played, you're missing a LOT of fun!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Format lacks and is limit compared to the regular desktop version...  Mobile use is in now - fix it!

B000JLTR8G|5.0|The topic of this film is one that I admit I am fascinated by. Not necessarily by the Japanese mafia but by Japanese culture as compared to the west. There should be more films like this instead of &#34;karate movies.&#34;
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I purchased the Wireless Scale and the Pulse. Everything worked great and I lost 20 pounds. Then my Samsung Galaxy Note II got stolen. I had to fire up my original vintage 2011 Galaxy Note version 1. After trying every reboot, reset, and reload trick in the book, I wrote to WIthings Support. Here's where things start to really suck:<br />Withings takes 5 days to respond to a a support request. There is no way to call, or have webchat with them. You send an email, and wait five days for an answer. Kind of draconian for such a modern product.<br />Now, after waiting five days, the Withings response was that the PULSE WILL NOT SYNC WITH A GALAXY NOTE. WITHTHINGS SUPPORT SUGGESTS I KEEP THE $99 PULSE AND PURCHASE A NEW PHONE.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved it.  I didn't want to stop playing.  The puzzles are great.  I had to get help a couple of times from my son.  This is the first time I have played a game like this and I liked it.  Can't wait for the next Room.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining was the first Stephen King book that I read, and became a big fan of his books.<br />Dr. Sleep did not disappoint.  I could not put it down.  It was wonderful!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|A good bingo game.  I just play by myself.  Not on facebook.  Maybe later when I have time I will try it out with others.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|wonderful characters, more robust and dimensional than early novels.  The horror is toned down and the ehart moves into play.
125000098X|5.0|I had thought that this was the concluding chapter of The Clifton Chronicles.  After finishing &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34; my first thought was, &#34;Surely he's not going to leave us hanging.&#34;  Much to my delight I now find there will be a fourth in the series.  Thank you, Mr. Archer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've seen my mom play this on her iPod for months, so when it finally came out on the Kindle Fire, I downloaded it to give it a try... Now I can't stop playing it! Well, except when I'm out of lives! A fun, puzzle like game (similar to Bejeweled) that's lots of fun and highly addicting! One I'd recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive, makes you think and good competition between friends and family, wonderful for people of all ages great idea.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|It's an all right movie. Even though it's futuristic and I love futuristic stuff, this is much like District 9 just without aliens. It's nothing special I was struggling between giving it 2 stars and 3, but the ending was quite good. I will not watch the movie again, it's just not worth it. By the way I didn't like actors, even though the acting wasn't bad.
055338466X|4.0|A readable and understandable book about a topic that is inherently difficult to comprehend. Written for the non-scientific reader. Shares space on my bookshelf with &#34;Brief History of Time&#34;, &#34;The Universe in a Nutshell&#34;, and &#34;My Brief History&#34;. Stephen Hawking is not only a brilliant physicist, but  a remarkably readable author.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love the game, but for some reason when  I got all 26 groups, it  said I have them all, but there's only 15.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank You Kindle Support Team, This is an addictive game.I watch my boss Tawana and My Brother Marcus and My Day Hab Counselor Sharon and Evelyn Play it.I Want in too.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book took me 6 months to read, but I'm finally finished! Although I'll admit it was difficult to get through at times because of the great detail about the French revolution and the extreme detail of each character, I would recommend it.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Puzo grabs your attention. I finished this in less than 8 hours. Never seen the movies but would recommend  the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the season. Haven't finished viewing the 3rd season, but am so hooked. Writing, acting, wardrobe, are all phenomenal.  Highly recommend.
B00AYHKIZ6|2.0|I bought this CD on the recommendation of a staff music writer of the magazine\\" The Absolute Sound\\". He claimed this CD is the best work from Bowie in 10 years.  So much for listening to a 28 year old magazine hack who was probably too young to recall  Bowie's  \\"Golden Years\\"  The sound of the CD is in your face most of the time with noisy, loud passages. Unfortunately, DB's voice is less musical and melodic, and on some tracks, it sounds tired.  The CD according to the above mentioned writer confirmed Bowie's return to rock and roll.  Well, that might be so in some ways, BUT in my humble opinion, the music begs for compliments;  the compositions are less harmonic and dramatic than what he wrote as part of Ziggy Stardust and the the Spiders.  Often, I could not wait until a track was over, hoping the next one would redeem its predecessor, if not the entire CD.  It was more an aural assault than music.<br /><br />I always considered DB a musical genius. I have a 2 discs best hits CD, and of the 20 or so tracks, there is only about two that should be trashed.  The songs: \\"China Girl,  Modern Love, Panic in Detroit, Ashes to Ashes, Cat People\\",.....and almost every cut on the Ziggy Stardust CD are enjoyable, clever in presentation, relying on melody, not bombastic background  washes.  To Bowie and company's credit, there are some interesting  jazz elements that are weaved through the later tracks, but they are often too short and the harmonic changes are crudely done. There is little finesse in these segues.<br /><br />I gave the CD a second listen last night, and grudgingly liked a few of the tracks better.  In my opinion, I think \\"The Next Day\\"  is a disappointment, and a blurry reflection of contemporary popular music values and culture<br /><br />The music of David Bowie in the late 70's and most of the 80's  has often been tagged glam rock, shallow,  overly simplistic .....however, the melodies and  harmonic structure of its tunes evoked deep emotions touched up with swagger and panache.  It may have been the last gasp of an era  of counter-culture and its highly innovative music.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Finding this app made my day. It's free, not glitchy in the slightest, and works on my Kindle Fire perfectly.
B00640UICA|4.0|not enough instructions when you get to upper levels.  the grand babies tire of it soon as it gets too hard for them pretty fast.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|This is a great single and it was easy and fast to download the song to the cloud and phone. I recommend buying all music from Amazon.
B007SVPZMW|3.0|its tictac toe.  what else can i say except you can not make anything else out of it .  takes a little too long to mark its selection.
B008JFUR10|1.0|Excellent special effects but poor acting and poor plot.  It's really more like a glorified cartoon than a movie.  I'm not really sure if it's poor acting or poor script writing.  The target audience appears to be 16 yr old boys.  Stylistically borrows from transformers, Aliens and Lord of the rings.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun to play works great on my kindle. In fact better than on my iPhone. Love that on the kindle it is larger and easier to play.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This was fun to reread. I think it has gone through a name change from 50 years ago.<br />We used LitLovers questions at the book club and got a good discussion. Several were surprised by the ending, but it all came together.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|thank you very much it is exactly what is advertised on tv and my kids are happy with the item
B0089LOG02|4.0|I felt I had learned things not known and given an opportunity to see how things were in an earlier time. Sad in places but warm in the connection of two people of very different ages. I want to learn more and will  read other books listed
1400034779|4.0|This is a story about an African woman who spends her inheritance on starting an unusual business - for a woman -a detective agency. From the beginning, Precious Ramotswe is asked to use all her woman's intuition in solving \\"people puzzles\\".  She does. She finds missing husbands, finds out about adulterous affairs, learns she was wrong with her advice, and also learns she was right in using her intuition. Stories are started in one section of the book only to be resolved in another section, etc. - by one word - \\"Jack\\".  Tears of sadness are finally turned into tears of joy all because of her intuition, etc. - he raced toward his son and picked him up and held him tightly.  His lost son was found.  The school teacher's tears of joy should have been everyone's tears. I know I cried with him.  The author also deftly set up a future story in this novel when he wrote that Precious, while standing in total darkness, felt the eyes of the doctor looking down upon her.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|omg. this is a super fun game. if you have seen the music video for this u technacly have to do the same things that they do but its a little bit different than that. buy this game!!!!!!
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Latest update a few days ago has pretty much rendered this app/widget useless, keeps force closing and not working properly. Will return rating back to 4 stars once this is fixed.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great show and even better since it came with my amazon prime membership.  Will def. be watching more love being able to download and watch anytime I want
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Such a beautiful and amazing world Cassandra Clare has created. The characters are as engaging as the plot. Really love this series.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown, Robert Langdon...The book explored a topic I was fascinated with. I love how Brown can write some chapters that are 20 pages and some that are 1 page
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Predictable but worth reading. A few tears shed here and there. Shows how cruel and how wonderful kids can be.
B00006AG5N|4.0|The first few songs seemed to lack the dynamic sound of the others, but perhaps that's due to earlier recordings not having the technology or stereo at that time?  Overall, a nice investment!
0143039431|5.0|I believe John Steinbeck did a superb job in writing this. The story itself tells of the Joad family and their honesty, wisdom, pain, courage, compassion, and their will to survive. The language and imagery throughout the story made me feel as if I was really there during the whole story. At times the Joad family felt as if they should give up but didn't. Although at times it may feel depressing or sad, their perseverance and compassion drove them to survive. It really makes you think of how good one know a days has it.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Wonderful, touching and full of hope or not depending on how you interpret it. I really enjoyed this book and recommend reading it yourself.
B00BD62X14|5.0|This also was a gift to my friend from Montreal.  She was very pleased.  Bruni has a very rare gift.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pros:<br />- Great for watching Youtube videos on TV from phone/ tablet/ laptop<br />- Works well for mirroring Chrome browser to watch content from other websites, or to play video files (via Chrome browser) on the TV<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Please include apps/ functionality to play locally stored content on laptop/ tablet via chromecast directly to TV
B00ECUARO8|4.0|it was a little slow of a movie but once it picked up was a good story hes a great actor i def recommend seeing it, it will you will be surprised
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun to play  a lot of level I really enjoy candy crush passing a friend is good too<br /> Hope keep up the feature
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game will keep you challenged from the first level to the last. sometimes a level will take many tries and sometimes you will clear it by mistake. I feel the key is to tryand plan your moves
B00CXL6XP0|1.0|It's got elements of what made Queensryche great, but it is NOT the same sharp, intelligent, and wholly unique sound that was the trademark of Queensryche.  In short, it may have some of the members of Queensryche, but Queensryche this album aint!  Bring back the original band and their original approach to music, we the fans miss it!!!!!!!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|How is it that this movie did so bad at the box office???  They need to re-release it! Great film and should have won an Oscar or two!
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Slow start, glossing over BUD/S and early career details, but very good once he gets going.  I enjoyed reading the testimonials first.  It gave a little more depth to Kyle's full personality that isn't as clearly seen in the body of the book.
1400052181|3.0|The book is heavy on her family history, which is somewhat boring. The chapters that tell about the HeLa cells are very interesting.
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Just like Star Trek and the communicator - this move explores the use of technology in government.  I'm a government worker trying to get a feel for how data could be used across departments and divisions more efficiently.  Now you see a lot more of the 'heads up' display, access to databases (parks facility inventory of merry-go-rounds) and assessor databases showing the construction materials in houses.  A good visual.  Plot was OK as well.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Excellent movie, it had a very good story line and Will Smith and Jaden Smith's parts were very well played. I was very impressed!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and I laugh out loud at some of it. I am glad I got it because at first I thought it was stupid. I really like this game and music video.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I enjoyed the first book the kite flyers but did not enjoy this one at all.  very slow and long the end
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game and addictive .Some levels take forever to get past but then when you do the next few go pretty well. Priced fair.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Great price.  All the stuff I love. great to see Kirk and the others.  Who doesn't love this kind of over acting.
6304711905|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I was tired of waiting for it come on T.V. So I added it to my collection on home movies. I have watched this movie several times since I purchased it. It arrived within 5 days from when I purchased it, and it came in perfect condition.
B002NC8JEC|4.0|Love the Jackson 5. Nice holiday music by a great band. You can never get enough of this group. Gave it as a gift.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I bought this as a present for my grandfather as he loves the old Star Trek with William Shatner. It was a great price and I think that this is a great gift for anyone who loves Star Trek!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really good 2nd part to the hunger games saga, not as much action as on the 1st book but excellent link between the events that happened on the first on to what is yet to come on the 3rd part, no wonder why this book got its own movies
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Loved it. Sad I saw the movie first but loved it all the more. The intra-personal dialogue is very well written
B00785P2QC|5.0|I LUV LUV TIS APP ITS SO AWSOME! I get to create my own city. I love it and my brother . Why  why my brother but still awesome game. Hope you LUV it too:)  :)  :)  :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Quite fun and relaxing. And Free too that's even better. Anyone can play small children. I play it on all the devices I can.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. The worst acting from Will Smith and his son. It was unbearable to watch.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Delightful. Masterfully directed, the scenes, the interplay of characters, and a very beautiful intertwining of memory,  of decline, and yet the hope of love, make this a film that draws me back to it again and again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this app is finally available for Kindle Fire! I am really far behind since I stopped playing it on my laptop. But my addiction has kicked in so I'm sure I'll catch up quickly.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Keep enough space storage on preferred device. Else you risk slowing down game play. Start up is another subject. Otherwise decent offline app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game. This is a fun way to use your brain. Prefect for times when one has nothing else to do; but watch out because after a few rounds of playing it is hard to put it down so do not start dinner because you just might burn it!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is  great app.  I am learning a great deal.  I do wish there was a list of all verbs to make it easier.  All in all, this is a great teaching tool.I would give it five stars.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love the show, but missed some of the fifth season episodes. It was great... no commercials, and back to back episodes! Passing it on to friends now!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so awesome in this as game u have to match a pair of candies it's so fun !!!!!!! Finally it's on Amazon I've been waiting last week it was not available but know it is because people been asking for it forever
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So Kindle finally has Candy Crush. Took you all long enough, geez. Anyway, as you probably know it's a great time waster. Just beware it doesn't take over your life!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is an overall great game, but I really hope glu adds a instant replay button if you want to see how awesome you did again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a great game it's worth buying. But it gets boring after a while unless u play with someone else. But, over all its AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|What a great book.  What inspiration.  What evil tried to destroy this wonderful girl.  She has a wonderful father.  If not for him, none of this would have happened.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|Loved the book, loved the movie the first time I saw it. Enjoyed looking at details within the movie, and analyzing the characters. Movies such as this one can be  enjoyable anytime.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So I didn't realize what a gem of a read I Thad found when I downloaded this book.  This had to be made into a movie!  Well worth the $6 for the set I loved the story and imagination.  Going to find more to this story!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! LOVE PLAYING! Highly recommended. Tons of fun and couldn't take my eyes off of the screen.  Download and play aye plus.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I don't know as much about Nazi Germany as I probably should but this book shows not only some of the history but the human emotions and conditions of that era. It tugged at the heart strings and made me cry from both happy and sad.  As humans we are all resilient, but this story shows just how strong we can be.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The Blind Side has some of the most inspirational storylines seen in decades. This movie stars Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw, Quinton Aaron, and Kathy Bates. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw decide to take in \\"Big Mike\\", a young man in need and make him part of their family. The young Quinton Aaron, as Michael \\"Big Mike\\" Oher, was so incredible and so believable in his part. This movie, based on a true story, will have you reaching for the tissues. Anyone easily touched by movies that tug at the heart should be prepared with a box of tissues and the pause button. It is worth it! It is a Must See!!!
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I bought this machine about a month ago to put a web site on that I had been paying for a commercial VPS account.  I installed Ubuntu Server 13.04 with a full LAMP stack.  Crucial 64 GB mSATA, and 8 GB of Crucial RAM.  I also have an external 2.5&#34; USB drive attached for backups.  All I can say is WOW!  What a great little machine.  The site is running very fast and smooth, and I couldn't be happier.  The performance running Linux is much better than I had expected.  I would not hesitate buying another.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game i think its the most popular game on phones amd. facebook if someone has never played candy crush than u must be missing a lot i would recomend it to all my friends but they already know about it i can't spend one day without playing this game
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome! This is an outstanding show and I cant wait to see next season! The British have the best serials like this show and Merlin
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The books are pretty good and the details they give are amazing in comparison to the tv series. The &#34;flow&#34; isn't the greatest tho. Jumps around character to character, but that's just a personal annoyance. They are written superbly.
1250038820|5.0|I have always watched the Humans of New York feed on Facebook and I always look forward to who had met that day. Brandon is a very brave for talking to random strangers everyday and getting their picture. Love the diversity and the stories. Thank you Brandon for sharing your collection of stories and photos with us!
B008HK3TXK|5.0|This is a very nice case. Seems to be sturdy, it stands up quite well. No need to take the kindle out of this case for charging - the ports are accessible. The only con is that the velcro strip that holds the kindle in place doesn't stay attached very well. Should be alright though, since the device fits into the opening pretty snugly.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I loved it , and have recommended it many times!  The story is so good.  Ok now its not a Will Smith movie, its more Jaden, and yes the accent and ghetto dialect should have been bred out 1000 years after Earth, that being said, this is an awesome kids movie and a kid at hearts movie.  When Will tells Jaden about &#34;FEAR&#34; I learned something!  Strongly Recommended!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Though I knew about Nikola tesla and read his theories I my engineering course .But thanks to this book now I know much more about this great person .<br />All in all an inspiring book ,superb style of writing easy to and grasp .Once you start this ,you will end only after finishing it .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have  not been using my Kindle much lately because you didn't have this game. I'm so grateful you finally have  the app, I thought I'd go blind playing the game on my phone's very small screen. Back to my Kindle :)<br />[[ASIN:B00FAPF5U0 Candy Crush Saga]]
1596680296|5.0|great book.  this woman knows her socks.  understandable, clear directions.  from 'simple' to complex.  a clear winner!!!  a &#34;must have&#34; for sock-knitter wanna-bes
B000OIZUW6|3.0|A great storyteller, but a lousy writer.  Translates to a GREAT story, poorly written. It would make a terrific movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! Kept me busy for quite a while..... and it was a different way of thinking I had to use..... challenging and fun.....  and bring some time.... you might need it... FUN
B008OOYALE|5.0|My grandson loves this game!! The  graphics are awesome and he loves the dragons, he can hardly wait to level up so he can get more dragons!
B00FWLTPU8|1.0|No character depth<br />awful lines and plot<br />movie made just to broadcast the special effects<br />actors and writers of the movie lack any skills in their field
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!!! I've been impatiently waiting for candy crush too debut on Amazon. Best game ever, family friendly.. Thank you for listening to your customers..
B00CJGP116|5.0|This cd has the sound of his great salsa style that Marc is so well known for.<br />I have yet to be disappointed in any of his music.  He rocks and he will be a singing legend in the salsa world.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is my go-to app for weather and forecasts. It ability to save favorite cities allows me to plan travel more thoughtfully.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love the original sound of this album.<br />It's so Bruno!!! Great lyrics & great music!<br />Very pleased with this purchase.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've read many of the tech geek's detailed overview of the Chromecast media player and that's all well and good but thought a shirtsleeve English version, (read--SIMPLE without the geek-speak), might serve some who are looking for a general overview.  First, the Chromecast dongle or media player does work and it doesn't take much expertise (thank GOD on MY part for that) to get it up and running.<br /><br />Your TV will ideally have a spare HDMI and USB port for the device to plug into.  Checking the back of your HD TV before ordering for these open ports would be a wise thing to do as some of the early HD televisions only had 2 HDMI ports and those are quickly used up on your satellite/cable boxes to plug into and your DVR player.  Then too, one of my early HD televisions had NO USB ports so be advised on that.  If you have the spare ports, and you should, it's a simple matter of plugging in the Chromecast device, then using your TV's remote (the brand name TV remote, not your Directv remote),to advance the screen to the HDMI port you plugged the device into.  In my case it was HDMI 3.<br /><br />The TV screen will return data right away, recognizing the device and putting a code number out.  Follow the on screen prompts, enter your in-home wifi access number which you'll do from your mobile device.  In my case it was using my Samsung Note II phone.  By the way, you will have already quickly downloaded the Chromecast software from the internet onto your phone.  The instructions in the device box will provide the address and this exercise is straightforward and without drama.  I already had Netflix software loaded on my phone so you'll need to do that if you haven't already.<br /><br />The TV screen will again recognize and advise that Chromecast is ready for use.  Pick a Netflix movie from your phone, play it and once it starts, hit the small box icon on top of screen to activate the Chromecast which in turn will be now grabbed by your TV showing the familiar red Netflix screen, along with a time circle and a small bar revealing the status of the movie download (5%....9%...20% etc).  Once done, on your phone, hit the start arrow and voila, the movie will play on your TV.  You can pause and re-start the movie from your phone.  The audio volume can be done with your remote..either from the TV maker or Directv remote in my case.<br /><br />Getting out of the movie and back to regular TV fare is a matter of again changing the HDMI port back to main viewing status, in my case that would be HDMI 1.  Sometimes you'll have to turn off the power to the TV and cable/satellite box in order for the dongle to 'let go'.  At least that's been my early experience as it keeps toggling back to HDMI 3 when I try the easy route to get back to regular TV viewing.  In essence, the dongle converts your HD television into one with SmartTV capability.  I only wanted to view Netflix movies on my TV and can't speak of what else the Chromecast can or cannot do.
0061122416|5.0|This story hit home for me & I've already shared it with a friend to read.<br />Perfect story for those in search of their desires & purpose in life.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This was one of the movies I had to watch on the big screen and was quite taken with it.  To watch it at home in 3D is just a much a treat.  Usually I'm not too fond of narration in a movie, but it certainly fits here.  I don't plan to watch it often, but will certainly watch it again and again.
1623650003|5.0|Let's hope more of Lemaitre's works get translated!  What a superb piece of writing.  Some pretty horrific subject matter handled very well.  All the characters come alive.  The writing is spare - not a wasted word.  Many twists and turns.  Loved it!
B007SGM084|5.0|50 Shades of Grey has been pegged as 50 shades of porno among other things in the media as of late. I personally read the 3 books cover to cover in less than 3 days. I couldn't put it down! I have never read another bondage/BDSM type genre before this series and have since looked into others. This series touches only lightly on those fantasies and is a good beginner series for someone interested. However, truly this book is a romance between Christian and Anastasia. A man with a dark troubled past meet girl who can heal him both mentally and physically. Again a must read for anyone wanting or willing to explore this fast growing genre!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game. Very addicting. I play it both on my kindle and my phone. Highly recommended for anyone who like hunting games.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|I actually saw this movie in a movie theater.  I'm sorry that it was not given a bigger build up. I liked it so much I ordered my own copy. It's a Mark Twain type of story where two boys discover a boat in a tree in Arkansas. The two boys are amazing to watch.  They run that river in a boat like a kid rides his skate board. I liked the character played by Matthew McConaughey, (Mud).  I would suggest this for older children 12 and over. There is some profanity used by the boys, violence and sexual reference, but not too graphic. I also liked the way family values were taught. Even if you are poor you can still have love and respect.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it it is so fun now I am on level  nine and now my mom is unhappy . Hahahahah
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I love this game every time I play it I smile every fun game and don't listen to bad reviews be happy playing this cool game
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I normally don't like tom cruise but I say let me see if this movie any good because Morgan freeman is Also in this movie,gabbage,hate it!
B00CATSONE|1.0|The book title is misleading. It's really a rambling pamphlet that summarizes &#34;Outliers&#34; by Malcolm Gladwell. Not a real biography of Tesla.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|My little girl - 5, is a big MH fan. So, we had, had, had to have Catty Noir. She loves it, together with her other 11 MH dolls. I know, mommy is a doormat:))
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun to kill some time! Even the music isn't annoying. A must play with friends and family. Love the colorful screens!
B00005UKE0|5.0|Another classic album that is a must have.  Not much more to say except I have to keep typing to meet the minimum words required for the review.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|After the giraffe incident, I was lost.  The absurdity that followed was too much for me.  Loved HP 1 and HP 2.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Like the game but there are too many technical issues. After this last update my game has so many issues I am considering deleting it and I am on level 70.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|After waiting and waiting Candy Crush has come to the Kindle! You must download this game! Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think the game is great .but you should not have to pay to play a game. I call that being ripped off.I play until it says pay . I think costing people should be dropped.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This very powerful little book is clearly an act of love by the author!<br />It cleared many areas of misunderstanding I have had in my search for the things of life that I value. Those things are: love, peace harmony, happiness, joy, and abundance.  If you are also searching for your way, I highly recommend it!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|great deal, just what I ordered, no problems with the transaction.  would recommend for any one interested.  good buy. don't know what else to say.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a supernatural thriller about a young girl who finds herself in another world\dimension<br />among a tribe of people who defend the world of man against an ever encroaching evil. Unlike most Sci-Fi\Fiction novels,<br />Beyond Bridalveil Fall is not so much about the exotic landscapes, the macho heroes, nor is it even so much about the<br />mystical powers of the supernatural. This story is about the characters. In this story, we have a tribe comprised family, friends, and even lovers who vie for Oria's attention. We have a most devious evil, but at the core of it all, we have a young girl who has little, if any time, to become the heroine that the world so urgently needs. She must transition from a young girl warmly nestled in her grand mothers mentoring ways into a woman, a leader, and finally, a warrior\hero. Throughout it all, she still has to wrangle with the emotions of a teenage girl. Love, jealousy, fear, the loss of her grandmother, and constant confusion.<br /><br />What impressed me the most was the clarity of the story which I believe is made possible by the use of characters who are Native American Indians.Native American Indians adhere to longstanding ways which embody a culture of simplicity, a language of directness, and a focus on purity for man, animal, and the land. Sheryl Seal has combined and enhanced these elements creating a story where the reader slips right into her world. Very quickly, the reader can imagine the landscapes, see the animals, and most importantly, feel the people. All of the people of Oria's new tribe complete her 'making' in one way or another. With their words, with their ways, and sometimes with nothing more than their touch or glance. That's what Sheryl Seal has tapped into with Beyond Bridalveil Fall.<br /><br />I highly recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a coming of age story, a face off between good and evil, and a passion for the supernatural.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish!  I could see so many of my dog, Dooley's expressions in Enzo.  What a great ending!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|When I first heard of emojis I thought this is going to be easy..not true..some are very easy SOME extremely difficult ALL entertaining..kind of boring by yourself if you're stuck..but that's why you should play with a group. ..I enjoy it very much
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|The novelty hasn't worn off yet! Very addictive. I refuse to spend money on add-ons, though. Still, plenty of amusement to be had.
B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This is an easy listening CD by John Legend. He does not disappoint and offers variety as expected by his fans. I would consider buying this CD as a gift for a friend or family member.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie this first time I saw it.  I can empathize with what it must have been like for royalty to have a speech impediment and suddenly find himself made King.  He had been bullied and made to feel inferior all his life by his family, which only added to his stress. Great movie. It's one that you find more and more details that you missed the first time it's viewed. Excellent acting by the entire cast.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Great game and being world war 2 historian I think they are spot on guns good show young caps very good show
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|This is another book that asks you to forget yourself and your abilities and watch for help from unseen. Didn't work for me.
B000294SFW|5.0|Great album whether you're a long time Motorhead fan or recent fan. Doesn't matter. This album will blow you away.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Yup, it's about time we learned about the lives of women in prisons. If you care about what is happening with women whether you consider yourself a feminist or not, you must read this book. While a memoir of her time behind bars, it shows us intimately the craziness or our penal system. There's also great information at the end for those of us who want to assist our sisters behind bars -- and when they finally get out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game. Some levels are incredibly challenging. Far too short, however. Only 10 levels. Please keep them coming.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|If you want to see 3 great action movies, these three are three of my favorites. Have watched them several times.
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|This non-Pixar feature from Disney Animation Studios is Fantastic. IMHO one of the best Disney princess films. Beautiful Animation, wonderful music, funny subplots, Classic.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Works great. Wish I had a note pad on everything that I used. Would recommend this product to everyone. It is a must have
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The 2nd book has a much better story line than the 1st. I could not put this book down and am excited to read the 3rd!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Bought this movie due to the 2nd movie coming out. Our 4 year old son loves monsters and this is a great play off of something scary brought into another perspective for children. I even as an adult enjoyed the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've chosen this rating because its an wonderful and mind game it keeps you on your toes my dislike is that it becomes very costly.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Just as expected. The game does well. I love to play spider solitary and this does the job. No major issues noted.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is so cool I mean come on no candy crush on Amazon finally it's here I just got this yesterday and I am already on level 17 love your candy crush game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I rather enjoy this game. It seems to be a play off the super Mario brothers game. Really fun to play
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game except getting stuck on levels for weeks at a time. Sometimes to beat a level it's just pure luck but I love the game.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down.  Even though it was written many years ago, it is still very exciting and a worthwhile read.  I felt as if I was on the ship battling the pirates at sea.  WOW!!!!!!!
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|This CD is good value for money and provides high-quality rythm & blues -- as expected.<br />Probably there is litle room for what one could call &#34;innovation&#34;.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I travel for work, so size is always a consideration. I also prefer my components to have attached cables, if possible. I have always been impressed with Anker so when I saw this model, I immediately ordered one. t use this with a Lenovo X1 Carbon Touch and it provides the additional USB 3.0 ports I need, The small size means it tucks in with the power supply and is always available for use.<br /><br />I've had 1 SSD and 2 HDD running at the same time with no problems, it has consistent throughput speeds equivalent to direct connections, plus or minus 5% - not scientific, just moved the same video file around between laptop, SSD and HHD. I can't comment on charging as this is not recommended. And although there is an internal surge protector to limit current throughput, I'm a bit cautious when it comes to really high current draws.<br /><br />All in all, I'd recommend this unit to anyone who is looking to expand USB 3.0 port count on a laptop. And you have the advantage of an 18 month warranty and some of the best customer support available.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This may be the most comprehensive and readable book about the deterrence and nuclear aspects of the Cold War written to date.  It also tells some great personal stories. The author's technique of mixing stories with historical development and technical explanations detracts from the stories. This makes it a slow read. It is an important book to read during these times. Just be ready to deal with it's dual personality.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I couldn't put The Elite down. It was full of plot twists, and moved at a lively pace. Definitely going to keep an eye out for the next book!
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|Thank you for your service.<br />I don't know how many times over the decades I have said that to a military veteran. After reading this book I have a substantially better understanding of what being a combat veteran really means. \\"Thank you\\" isn't enough.<br /><br />This isn't a \\"military thriller\\", it is an autobiography that is well presented to see into the personality, mind and heart of a patriot who was a military hero ... who was also married, with children. We get personal insights into what drew Chris Kyle into the military, watch him evolve into the SEAL sniper The Legend, but also watch him struggle with the conflict of prioritizing service to his country where he contributed so well, brotherhood loyalty to his SEAL Team, and his family relationships back in the USA. We see brief glimpses of Taya also struggling and growing while she shares some \\"military wife\\" personal perspective and challenges she experienced, which I think is an important contribution to help the reader better understand that aspect of Chris' life. Chris Kyle shared himself as a person before, during and after his incredible service, with a lot of information on his military experience that opens eyes for anyone non-military as well as providing some insights into the war from his perspective. Well done.<br /><br />Knowing the history makes it a harder emotionally but very worthwhile to read through the memorial letters from those who knew Chris, to see how others perceived him as a person beyond The Legend. He touched so many lives. SEAL, family man, good friend to many, hero in so many eyes as a warrior *and* as a human being. And he and his friend died trying to connect with yet another veteran. What a tremendous loss. You can feel the pain of that loss on every memorial page.<br /><br />This memorial version is also an eye opener regarding our many other active military, veterans, and their families, and needs that may not have been met. Chris described his own struggles to transition to civilian life, and later helped others make that transition. Thousands more are still struggling. Saying \\"Thank you for your service\\" just doesn't seem like enough. This autobiography and some of the web site links provided to organizations helping our veterans helped me understand that better.<br /><br />Read this book as an autobiography that includes substantial insight into Chris Kyle's experiences as a SEAL and sniper, and you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for a Chris Kyle book with more technical information on the weapons, [[ASIN:0062242717 American Gun: A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms]] is a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Challenges your skill yet simple in theory.  Match three who can't do that.  Well give it a try, see how easy it is for you.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In my 60 years of reading this book was easily among my top 100, maybe top 30. The character development, the plot twists, the cliff hangers, must read!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I think that all of<br />The diary of a wimpy kid<br />Books are all the same<br />And all have the same awesome quality.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|: ) I had a lot of fun with the game I recommend this game for everyone five stars game
B001NEK2GE|5.0|When I first got it, I didn't really use it very much, but overtime became more accustomed to it. I now have a different profile for every game I have, and even if it doesn't give me a tactical advantage in a lot of them, it is just overall more comfortable.<br /><br />I also have profiles for other programs such as PowerPoint and for my coding classes, wherein I have buttons set to print a line of code that I use often, so instead of retyping it I can simply hit one button<br /><br />Overall fantastic product, great for both gaming and practicality
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Very interesting read and well put together. I purchased te book and started to read it in a Monday evening and was done by Wednesday. I couldn't out it down.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|All I wanted was an app I could use to read PDF and EPUB books and I haven't found one yet . It was  a waste if time to even download it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is the best game for realistic dragons I like it a lot because its fun and intertaning. and interactive
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Simple but challenging.  Enjoy playing on Sunday with my morning coffee.  There IS a solution to each puzzle but you sometimes just have to put it down and walk away for a while before you find it.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I play this game with my kids and granddaughter we have a real blast. I tell all my friends about it. I love the challenge of the game.
B003L77FYS|5.0|If you like the previous seasons of Castle you will like season 3. Castle is a police detective drama with the spin of the writer Castle following along with the homicide squad. The homicide squad is not suppose to be dumb and can work without the writer but are better with Castle. The cast is an ensemble that appear to work well.
B005LLX582|3.0|I had high hopes that this movie that I had not seen when it first came out and had good reviews would be worth adding to my library.  It is kind of weird but since it was not violent or objectionable, we did get through to the end.  Do not expect a PLOT and maybe you will enjoy it.
B00ESF2772|1.0|THis book and the other Dr. Suess books take up the whole screen in such a way that I canot get my Kindle to respond to my touch on the screen, except to turn the page. I cannot exit the book until I get to the very end. So if my child wants to end before the book is finished I find myself turning pages to get to the end and then finally being able to exit.  There is no back arrow or home icon available during these books. This is frustrating. At times I have had to turn my Kindle off and reboot in order to go somewhere else.  I love Dr Suess books. But this particular arrangement is a pain.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now all y'all need to do is put pet rescue on here and I'll definitely be in love. I love these games.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|really enjoyed it! great for a afternoon quick read. wish it had been longer...would read more books by this author.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|this looks and feels like a 100+ dollar watch!    -I love the dials, the triangle on top  - awesome movement of the pointers  - actually says the day and date!  -nice strap with solid real metal strap holders!  - Awesome clear back so you can see the wined movement of no batteries!    This watch is rugged and tough too, ive worked on cars with it, banged it, water, dirt, shot with it. etc...  i almost dont like doing s*** with it because its so nice looking.  but it can handle it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting forever for Amazon to pick up...awesome game and no you don't have to pay to move forward but it's most helpful to have a Facebook account. So many levels!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great series even the non plot episodes were ggood.cant wait to finish the entire series on amazon prime. Great five star series
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|This is such a great album. I play it a lot in the house and now I have the whole family singing their songs! Their fan base continues to grow.
B003B02O0U|5.0|I really like almost all of John Grisham's books and own most of them.  The &#34;Pelican Brief&#34; is one of my two favorites.  I wanted the Kindle book to be able to be more portable which was so convenient on vacation.  I also have the movie.
B003730LRY|5.0|Completely original and an instant classic. If you like deadbeat humor, gothic and macabre style comedy, this movie is for you. I have watched this movie at least 15 times and can quote  many lines. I loved the television series, but I have to say that the movies are better. The cast fits perfectly, with Christina Ricci (Wednesday) being my favorite; she plays the part wonderfully and has creepy down to a point. This is a must watch movie and I highly recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I was a little leary to read this because I enjoyed the original so much and I didn't want to spoil it. I thought it was a very good read however I wouldn't recommend to someone has only seen &#34;The Shining&#34; and hasn't read the novel, as this story follows the original book. If you've read &#34;The Shining&#34; and liked it, I recommend picking this up. I thought King did a good job of wrapping up the story.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like dragonvale better but the thing I like about this game is there are so many dragons they are colorful and bright and more unique dragonvale is easier to me that's why still Dragon story is cool
B0082XJGRK|5.0|Live humbly, live simply...be excellent to each other. This book is soothing and helps restore faith in humanity during these rough times. I recommend everyone read this and I am annoying my family to read it!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Practical, affordable  and effective product  I believe that as soon as other Apps are added it will pwrfect. I recommend it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a fun game and I enjoy playing. But I wished there was a way to save the game. Since I had to reset my tablet.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|Really enjoyable read. More philosophical than I expected in the second half - but very thought provoking. Happy to recommend it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent acting.  The characters are complex-unlike most shows these days.  The storyline is good, but the actors make it excellent.  I am a documentary nerd, but a friend talked me in to watching this show.  When I realized it was historical fiction I was very interested, and after watching the first episode I was hooked.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I love the way this book was written - in letter form.  It was different than what I'm used to reading but it was great and the story flowed.  The author did a great job bringing these characters to life.
B00BFV1M1Y|5.0|I like the mixing and matching of friendship and how some of them actually die.<br />I would recommend this book to teenagers preferably around Thomas' age, or adults who are can take mild horror.<br />I rated this book 5 stars because it is simply an awesome book with the detail that is required to keep someone from putting this book down.<br />:-)
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Like the ability to upgrade equipment. Moving targets and added bonus is great way to keep engaged in game. Only down fall is small reward but takes more hunts to have enough for upgrades.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|Which isn't saying much, because as a rule I hate musicals.  This one is typically cheesy: the dialog is bad, the acting is terrible, and not all the characters sang their own songs - the Captain's and the Reverend Mother's songs were both dubbed by other singers.  However, for some reason I have an emotional attachment to this movie that I just can't shake.  I love the songs, and the Austrian scenery is breathtaking.  It used to be shown on TV every Christmastime during the '70s and I remember watching it faithfully as a teenager then.  I suppose part of the reason I love this movie so much is that it takes me back to a simpler time in my life.
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|Is a very good CD my best friend John had a tape of her in his car.<br />And played it for me.<br />I liked it so he gave it to me.<br />I later bought the CD.<br />The CD was So tonight that I might see.<br />I found a copy of Seasons of your day on vinyl at a local record store in Fort Lauderdale called Radioactive Records on Federal also known as US1 near Sunrise Boulevard.<br />If it hadn't been for them I might never have thought to purchase the CD's through amazon.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|The graphics are great and the walkthrough is much appreciated by a game novice like myself.<br />I will consider buying more G5 games.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only reason this game received four stars on my part is that some of the levels seem impossible go beat as the player doesn't seemingly control the flow of blocks. If the correct blocks don't fall; you don't win. Otherwise, it's a lot of fun and highly addicting! :)
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I enjoyed this book so much as soon as I was finished I down loaded the next one onto my Kindle.  A lot of times after reading a book and enjoying it, I sometimes get let down by the ending.  Not so with this book.  I was happy about the ending and will also look into other books by the author.  Good action and excellent detail throughout the story and kept me turning the pages so to speak.  I highly recommend this series and hope the follow up is as entertaining as the first.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|My mom recommended this book and at first I was skeptical, but it turned out to be an entertaining read. Marco and Celia's story is a Romeo and Juliette tale entrenched in the world of magic. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|Watched this movie with a friend. We stopped watching before the end because we were both uncomfortable with the content. A plot with a killer holding a child for sex as collateral is disturbing. The whole plot was terrible. I only wish I truly knew what I was getting (the summary for the movie doesn't suggest what this movie is truly about) before I watched..
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Variety of challenges and variety of levels provides ample imagination and retains attention.  Moderately frustrating in the survival mode when you work and work and work only to find yourself completing 60 or 70 percent of the challenge.  I often play until my hands are cramping!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The idea is good, the device is cheap, but it just constantly crashes, no matter what. It crashes with good internet connection, with bad connection, and when it works, the streaming speed is very slow, it doesn't work like it should.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This installment of the series was a departure from the tone of the first novel, but a well-written and interesting chapter in the saga.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|We ordered the first and second season and could hardly leave the TV.  It certainly keeps your interest.  It certainly is R rated but that goes by the wayside once you are into the plot.  I would recommend it if you enjoy intense drama.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I recommend this seller and this album! It was a delight to receive it earlier than expected and well worth the great price!
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Don't like scary movies but was entertained!! It was good and kept my attention. It was scary but not bloody
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great story, well written but I thought the sex went overboard. I liked this book very much, even with the extra sex.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I found Rose to be refreshing character.<br />She was quirky but not in an overdone way.<br /><br />Rose behaved in ways that were believable, overall.<br /><br />The mystery was pretty good. I was intrigued and interested in seeing how it would be resolved.<br />I had figured out what Joe's real job was. I think if Rose had not been so sheltered, she would have also.<br /><br />The characters felt authentic, I'm glad that I read this book.<br />It was a free read but it was so much better than many of the \\"free\\" books that can be found online.<br /><br />I will continue to read this series. Rose is great! Her puppy Muffy is just as odd and quirky as she was.
B002XUL9B4|5.0|Nora is a very amazing Cat:-) The Catcerto is the Top of the Pops!!! Very good DVD. I'm very happy and I advise it at all animals friends.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|It's so much quicker access to my email, docs, etc. I've never had any issues with this app. which really surprised me.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is really cool ...... and the machines are like nice lol war machine is d shiz I swear ........ really good game and everyone should get it ..... trust me it's that good
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its finally available for Kindle Fire!!! And its as addictive as people say!!!  Very fun to play and time flys! Thanks Amazon!!! (=^_^=)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game and my face book friends and family enjoy it.  I would recommend this game to any one.  i have it on my cell phone, lap top and kindle fire.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Lotsa Fun!  I can't put it down.  Perfect puzzle game for the casual gamer of all ages, with fun little animated characters. It's not too difficult but still somewhat challenging.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they finally made this for my kindle and it syncs with Facebook with no issues. Also you can play it offline. Very nice!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game to play with the kids.  We worked together.<br /><br />We enjoyed it for hours. Cannot wait for more levels.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was a great movie  for both men and women with both romance, suspense, and action. I would highly recommend it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a good game to kill the time, you wont be disappointed!! One of the best hunting games out there..
B0091REZMW|4.0|FUN game..wish the screen was larger. Too much extra stuff on the game board. Not really sure of the story line but I love hidden object games so I'll keep playing
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Bought it for my grandchildren. They love it. The only issue I have, is that they want to buy items to keep the game going. I don't believe that is fair. They should be able to enjoy this game without having to come to me to purchase stars, fire and other. So they have to wait for the timer to end to get more lives. Too many grandchildren to purchase all the time. Other than that, they do love the game, it keeps them occupied, and great for hand movements and keeps them challenge on to where they can fire the ball to get the most points.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|That was great, really useful info and easy and fun to read. Can't wait to try the techniques. Thank you.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|The app was fun at first but after the third level it gonna have to pay for extra help. But other than that it's good app but it should've had more levels for free
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Fun game that requires you to recall various scenes and think creatively. I was concerned it might become somewhat repetitive but was pleased by the new challenges.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. I'm so happy that Amazon finally got it for the kindle! Great game!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Unable to se in  the tv any thing but e-mails.<br />Can not see my pictures.<br />Letters font to small to appreciate at a distance.
B00DQR26EC|4.0|It is a good game with lots of humor but it crashes alot so it would be a good idea<br />to save often
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works well.  I really like the graphics when you win.  Good basic game. I recommend it for the alligator lover.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like this app but I love the x-box more. I want more stuff in the next update because its almost boring if u compair the two.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|thank you amazon.!!!!  I'm so glad this game is finally on here. its so much better playing on a bigger screen than my phone.
088029261X|4.0|great compilation but the ink print on the odd number pages are two tones lighter than the even number pages;otherwise a great read.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Liked this for its interesting structure and character development. Not what you might call high brow fiction but good read.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|just shocking ,,,, America the way i see it we can compliant about it  .. but the banks hold all the cards at the End ..... and i learned
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thank you so much after waiting for so long to play this game on my kindle fire HD  works great .... :)
B004RUF9DC|3.0|The Greatest Story Ever Told was released in 1965. MGM didn't remaster this film for Blu-ray so it's only marginally better than the DVD. The picture quality is average but the audio is fairly good. There is less than an hour of bonus content. A decent remastering and a 3-hour making of documentary would be terrific for a future release. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release.<br /><br />Video Codec: MPEG-4 AVC   Resolution: 1080p   Aspect ratio: 2.75:1<br />Audio: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 2.0, German DTS 5.1, French Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, German<br /><br />Special Features:<br />He Walks in Beauty (SD; 14:57)<br />Filmmaker (SD; 27:38)<br />Deleted Scene (SD; 2:29)<br />Theatrical Trailer (HD; 3:32)
1400064287|5.0|Don't even think about skipping this title. You will regret not taking the time. It is an easy read, full of valuable information about making a lasting impression on someone's memory. Take advantage of the information, and put it to good use.
B00847KFDS|4.0|I support John whenever I can as I think he got some raw deals over time, but his music doesn't disappoint, so that is not the only reason.  This is a good album that I'll definitely keep in rotation..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game saw everybody around me playing and now that I've started I can't get enough.. highly recommend to all ages :)
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|What a great surprise to see an album from Black Sabbath that stuck right to their music style with an added bit of maturity.  I was grinning a lot while I listened to the music.  It's a keeper for sure.
B00E3VTR1K|4.0|I went through moments of like and dislike while reading this book. There's a collection of stories in this book, that I mistakenly, thought were connected. I made that crazy connection to begin with because the first story, Rewind, ended with talk about the universe being almost like a game and it being reset if the character(in this case, Alberto), wanted to go back and start over. Since he said Yes, I assumed the following stories were about him, but as a different person and in a different world with a different theme, almost like a game. Maybe, if you think about it, that is the case but I don't think so.<br /><br />I disliked the second story, The Kingdom of Turlis. I thought it was boring. The third story, Life in Prison had me cracking up. It was so bizarre. Poor Narios was thrown in a jail in space and no one would tell him why he was arrested in the first place. The fourth,seventh and ninth  story, Forms of Love, Arcot and the Queen, and Maciste were okay. The fifth story, Lactrodectus Mactans, was pretty messed up at the end. The eighth and tenth story, The Perfect Family and Clouded Emotions were eye opening and brilliant.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book. I've become a Rossi fan.

0307719219|2.0|The authors start by trashing theories based on culture and geography, as if their theory (inclusive vs. extractive institutions) is disconnected from culture and geography. The chains of causality are complex in understanding why some societies prosper, but just dismissing all alternative theories by providing anecdotal evidence is plainly ridiculous. In the notes they refer to one of their own academic articles providing some kind of justification, but the book does not elaborate. Economics is a young since and tends to be quite dogmatic when it thinks it has found the truth. The authors clearly believe in their truth, but I am convinced that in another ten years another economist will claim another truth. Some humility would be in order.<br /><br />The book is very well written, but is too simplified. For instance, do we really know to be told what GDP is? It is as if they are writing the book aimed at bored, American undergraduates. Furthermore, to make the American lay reader keen to read the book, the US is always good. At one point they talk about Barbados having extractive institutions in the 17th century because they had slaves. When discussing the US in the 17th century, its institutions were inclusive because they had some kind of democracy. So convenient to just forget the US slaves and the native Indians.<br /><br />I have no major problem with a theory about institutions which, by the way, is similar to Douglass North [[ASIN:0521397340 Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance (Political Economy of Institutions and Decisions)]], but with a Marxian twist. However, a bit more engagement with the existing research on institutional theory would have been nice. To that critique the authors would undoubtedly respond that this is not a scholarly book but a pop-science book. Maybe a fair response, but I would imagine that potential readers would be a bit more educated.<br /><br />While I have sympathy for the authors' theory, I have to say that it is very simplistic. The distinction between inclusive and extractive institutions is key. I am probably a bit unfair but if the authors seem to like a country, it is judged to have inclusive institution and vice versa (i.e. they seem to grab evidence to support their existing view). More to the point, the authors argue for a power perspective. A group in society will implement extractive institutions if they have the power to do so. As I mentioned above, this is almost a Marxian perspective, but that is not mentioned in the book. This is a good illustration of what I mean with the authors' theorising being simplistic.<br /><br />The book describes a large number of historical episodes that are very interesting. The authors try to fit them to their theories. I certainly think that the author get it right most of the time but I am left with the nagging suspicion that the authors are fabricating their evidence. I honestly think that they are not really trying to fabricate, but their know-it-all attitude and ad hoc explanations when the theory does not seem to work are big warning flags for me.<br /><br />In fact I wonder if their framing is the correct one because what they label extractive/inclusive institutions seems to boil down to extractive institutions not engaging in creative destruction (Schumpeter's term for dynamic capitalism). Extractive institutions are upheld by people with so much power so they can stop creative destruction. So why talk about institutions when the mechanisms seems to be something else. I can find good reasons for doing what the authors have done, but what I dislike is that such a discussion seems to be beyond the authors' interest. Again the book becomes shallow.<br /><br />This book deserves a read if you read many books. If you want to read one better pop-science book with a similar theme I would settle for the historian Ferguson's [[ASIN:0143122061 Civilization: The West and the Rest]], which covers similar ground. I found that book more insightful and I learnt more history by reading it. The current authors start their book by contrasting South and North America. Ferguson deals with the same topic which makes me wonder.<br /><br />Finally, a pet topic of mine: A trend I absolutely hate is to put footnotes as endnotes. This book goes one step further by even removing the references to the endnotes. What is wrong with adding footnotes on the relevant page so that more advanced reader can get a mouthful?ook more insightful and I learnt more history by reading it.

B009XHAM8G|5.0|I recently purchased the Kindle version of this little book because it has long been a family favorite. In fact, prior to our mother's death she began telling us goodbye by saying she loves us forever and we always responded with, \\"Forever and ever my mommy you'll be.\\"<br /><br />I agree with one reviewer who said this book seems to ring a bell better with adults. We were all adults when we latched onto it and it filled an important role in our family during our mother's terminal illness. In fact, it became so significant to our mother that we passed out copies of this book at her funeral and three of us read the book and explained its significance to us.<br /><br />If I could change anything about Love You Forever, I'd put the text on the same page with the pictures. Flipping back and forth to match the pictures and the text is annoying to me and our grandkids.<br /><br />I'd buy this book again and again, not so much for the words in the book but for the feeling it evokes in us.

B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Let's remain short on this one.<br /><br />Liberace is a myth in show biz. A gay piano performer who all his life hid his orientation under a fake heterosexual liaison that had no real material density at all. All his life he ran after younger twinks to feel his youth back again, with a few implants. That was before the blue pill of Viagra. But one day he tried a new one who was probably slightly better than the others, more special. Description from the urban Dictionary: \\"An attractive, boyish-looking, young gay man. The stereotypical twink is 18-22, slender with little or no body hair, often blonde, dresses in club wear even at 10:00 AM, and is not particularly intelligent. A twink is the gay answer to the blonde bimbo cheerleader.\\"That Scott accepted to have his face reshaped into a semblance of Liberace's. He accepted all kinds of crazy sex but he refused to be taken from behind, some old fear of the dark I guess, since he was let's say an orphan who had been raised in foster care and who found the perfect foster family to support him. In other words he was not \\"a blonde bimbo cheerleader.3<br /><br />He was attracted by the light, the gold, the gems and jewels, the white uniform though it looked more like a sentimental sweet Halloween costume to impress old ladies, or old queens, white fur coat included. He resisted nothing except that visitor at the back entrance. Pathetic! I guess then Liberace was impressed and as long as the resistance was active he went on trying. He even tried to compensate the frustration by trying to adopt Scott as his proper son, or was it a con from a con-artist? But that kind of theatrical sublimation did not work at all. So time had come to get rid of the gnat. And Liberace did in one swat.<br /><br />Till death them parted! And just before that sad AIDS moment he called Scott to come and take his last words, watch his last tears, shed some crocodile tears out of confusion and frustration. We are not told what the will gave him.<br /><br />The film ends up with the cardiac arrest caused by a heart failure, turned into the sequels of the AIDS virus by some coroner's office.<br /><br />The film tries to end the show, that must go on anyway, with a love song, in fact a long poem recited by Liberace to his own piano music and that song is a marvelous love song indeed, the love song of an older man to a younger man - though it could be to a younger woman all the same. The age difference that Liberace could not deal with made him over sexual whereas there comes an age when a man can love with love and not lust with sex. Liberace never found that epiphany that would have redeemed him from total fright in front of his own age. It is so good to love someone who is younger, a lot younger than you even, just for the love of him or her, for the heat and the emotion you feel in your heart that is not invaded by some hormonal and endocrinal greed.<br /><br />There comes an age when the wolf in man can finally go to sleep and let the platonic emotions of the loving phoenix come out of the shadow of the receding night that will bring the illumination of the last call. To be reborn instantly from its own empathetic ashes. To be reborn instantly in the lasting memory of the loved one's responsive soul.<br /><br />A beautiful film about a time when love was not accepted in the narrow circles of the straight fundamentalism of fairy bashing.<br /><br />But let me give you the final sentimental, slightly over sugary love song that sounds like a Hallmark Valentine's.<br /><br />Why do I love you?<br />I love you not only for what you are,<br />But for what I am when I'm with you<br />I love you not only for what you have made of yourself,<br />But for what you are making of me.<br />I love you for ignoring the possibilities of the fool in me,<br />And for accepting the possibilities of the good in me.<br />Why do I love you?<br />I love you for closing your eyes to the discords in me,<br />And for adding to the music in me by worshipful listening.<br />I love you for helping me to construct of my life<br />Not a tavern but a temple<br />I love you because you have done so much to make me happy.<br />You have done it without a word, without a touch, without a sign<br />You have done it by just being yourself<br />Perhaps after all, that is what love means<br />And that is why I love you.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUc in me by worshipful listening.<br />I love you for helping me to construct of my life<br />Not a tavern but a temple<br />I love you because you have done so much to make me happy.<br />You have done it without a word, without a touch, without a sign<br />You have done it by just being yourself<br />Perhaps after all, that is what love means<br />And that is why I love you.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

Have no idea how much time is passing while I'm playing....<br /><br />I wish there were a way for more than one person to play the game - change players.  I'd love to share this with family.  Love finding the secret gems, moths, etc., but wish finding them all opened up a new level or something. There doesn't seem to be an incentive for really trying to find them all....<br /><br />I enjoyed it so much that I went back and bought Hidden Objects Quest 1....
B00CRGZMUI|5.0|I love Bridget, with all of her lovely messiness and realness.  So I'm definitely biased enough to overlook the book's format issues (the texting/twittering exchanges, ugh) and the killing off of Mr. Darcy (NOOOO!)<br />I also don't have a problem with Bridget's toy boy, the fact that she doesn't have to work, or her parenting style.  If she wasn't getting into messy relationships and had suddenly transformed into a formidable super woman she wouldn't be Bridget.<br />The book was fun, sweet, and totally true to Bridget's character (which is the whole point of these books after all.)
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Harden's writing style makes for easy enjoyable reading. He seems to make accuracy a priority rather than trying to shape his story into what the reader wants to hear. I was moved by the account of Camp 14, and I liked the way it was written.

I truly look forward to ”Beyond Oria Book 2.” Sheryl has displayed a creative story telling talent.  ”Beyong Bridalveil Falls” has humor, mystery, love, suspense, good, evil, community, friendship and family togetherness.

0684867621|5.0|Great Stephen King reading, as usual.  In some ways, for me, this was a real cliff hanger.  Will not disappoint.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of action/adventure films but love the Iron Man series and loved the Avengers.  Seems a fitting film for our times.  The good guys triumph in the end.  No matter how bad things get, you know they will.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|First off: Doctor Sleep is not scary. It's pure horror story though, reaching for a dreadful atmosphere that builds with intensity as the characters stumble and try not to fall. Very few horror novels are actually scary so I don't judge them on this basis alone. Is the writing at a high level? Yes. In King's new novel, his writing hasn't been this good in a long long time. Are the characters compelling? Yes, because fans of The Shining (please read that first, by the way) are already familiar with the Torrance family, and are rooting for Doc. Is the plot complex enough to keep me turning the pages? Yes, even though there is very little King hasn't done before with this kind of set-up.<br /><br />There are different ways to read horror novels, and many different ways to write them. Some readers of horror novels expect to be scared, and place all expectations in this happy fearful basket. What is interesting about Stephen King's books is that the author wants to scare readers, but he's also content with telling a horrific tale that has dread in the center of the heart of the book--some of his books are not scary at all, but are horror tales that push all the right buttons. The Shining is my favorite scary horror novel, and it truly does scare. When I return to the Overlook Hotel, reading the story of the doomed Torrance family, I know what to expect, but I am scared once more. And so, it was with a wonderful feeling of surprise that I picked up the sequel to The Shining, Doctor Sleep, which finds Danny Torrance all grown up. He's now Dan or Daniel, or called Doctor Sleep because he helps hospice patients during their last moments on this earthly plane, soothes the next step on the journey.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is not scary the way The Shining is, and there's a bit more science fiction or paranormal activity added to the mix (more similar to the make-up of the characters in Firestarter actually). The villains, while showing compassion for their own kind, are stock characters who are evil to the core. The best monsters are always selfish and cold. King writes wonderful iconic villains and Rose The Hat will grow as one of his best creations. But, even though Doctor Sleep is not scary, it is horrific.<br /><br />The Torrance family story begun so long ago in the 70s is steeped in abuse, and specifically, child abuse. King continues this theme in Doctor Sleep. He hits it hard, and it becomes a repeating drumbeat throughout. Children in peril is something King knows well . . . look at Cujo, Firestarter, Carrie, It, The Body, and so many more tales. Alcoholism also plays a strong role, as Danny fights this demon he inherited. Will he overcome his addiction? It's part of the structure of the tale so I won't say. You'll just have to find out for yourself.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is King's best book since It, which was published in the 80s. The writing is better, and also made me recall how quickly I would whip through the early work of King and how I struggled to finish much of his 90s oeuvre.<br /><br />Now I can see King revisiting a few other characters he created a long time ago . . . he did a knockout job. If you loved The Shining, you will love the sequel because he ties into the atmosphere of doom almost immediately, and Wendy and Dick do make appearances. The end was a bit predictable, but this didn't detract from the story whatsoever.<br /><br />Enjoy your Halloween reading choices.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|Just a great flick if you like nature birds and being entertained without getting into anything too deep.  Jack Black ,Steve Martin, and Owen Wilson manage to share the screen in an additive way.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was caught up immediately into this story.  The intertwined stories of the two heroines kept me intrigued and could not put it down.  Read in one day.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is very fun for a free game and you can actually play longer than five minutes unlike most free games. Great for kids with lots of animals from the movies.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app for all my calculations. It is on my kindle, which I Aldo use for many other applications besides reading.  The calculator plus has a very large touch screen for entering numbers.  This id important because it prevents mistakes.  As you can see, I find typing on the kindle easy but mistake prone! A calculator needs to be mistake proof and this one is.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|This is well paced movie with strong character development. The acting is excellent. I cry every time I watch this movie.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|just a love story disguised as a sci-fy movie. Good twist, but predictable toward the end. I would suggest it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so addicting! I just wish it was easier to get help from non facebook friends. Like people in the chats, I wish there was a way to send or receive gifts without searching for the on facebook.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Fast paced and a really good twist on the Khan tale. Well written and portrayed. Kirk grows up and Pike shows why he is a true leader. See it twice.
B001H9MYPW|4.0|I really enjoyed Season One. I can see the therapist getting weary with his difficult clients, who are so defensive. However in  part, I wonder if that is happening because Paul offers up &#34;interpretations&#34; too early, and too often, without letting the client come up with their own insights first. I feel a therapist should listen more than he talks. I realize it is fiction, but I'm really wrapped up  in the series. Gabriel Byrne does a great job of acting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thank heavens you only get five lives or I'd never stop playing. It only gets four stars  because I find it annoying to wait for friends to send me tickets to the next level.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Action-packed from the beginning. The robots were incredibly cool. Reminded me of my childhood old Godzilla movies, but with cooler robots fighting monsters. I am sure I'll be watching this again.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Does the job on my Android tablet.  The feel is better on my Paperwhite Kindle, but I cannot tell you why.  Maybe it is the menu and Go To feel better on my Kindle.

B001G9LVGG|4.0|Loreena is always fabulous but there are a few numbers on this CD which don't meet my expectation of Christmas.  Winter Solstice does not equal Christmas, so please leave these songs off of the Christmas albums.  For the most part however, I love it.
1842437240|5.0|I loved, loved, loved the DRIVE movie -- and love this book, even though it's wildly different. And make no mistake, this book is nothing like the movie from which it was based.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I saw this in the theater in IMAX and couldn't wait to for it to come out on blu ray. I personally found it better than the last Star Trek movie, and I really enjoyed that one. I did buy the 3D version, but for this film I'm not sure it is really worth it.

B003V6L94Q|5.0|Lost ours so had to buy a new one--this is a terrific CD--great band--great songs and music--if you like Old Crow Medicine Show--you will like this.
B000GWE44U|4.0|I like the movie because it had a slow and suspenseful build to the end. It was at times a little too slow, especially in the action. The music was amazing because it was very creepy and really set the mood, although they did over do it at times like when the cook was on the plane and creepy music was playing. It's worth a try watching, especially if you're not into the modern super gory horror of today. It'll still make you pretty scared with very few scenes that could be considered scary. It's interesting, and if you do watch it check out the spoof trailer on youtube that makes it look like a family film, that'll make you laugh.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It's got more information than I need on a daily basis.<br />It loads reasonably fast, switches between locations easily... in one word... cool

B006IDG2T6|4.0|In the past I've read several of Mr. Harris' books, including &#34;The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason&#34;, and &#34;Letter to a Christian Nation&#34;. I think Mr. Harris is brilliant, smart and even entertaining, but I just could not help feeling shorted when I finished &#34;Free Will&#34; at less than 100 pages. I felt like I read a thesis or a term paper, rather than a book.  Do not get me wrong! I felt that the book did what it was supposed to do, and made me question the idea of &#34;free will&#34;. Mr. Harris attempts to answer the question, &#34;Are people truly evil or are they victims of their own biology?&#34;, and addresses the issue of &#34;luck&#34;. We are where we are in life, partly by luck and partly by biology, which I agree with.<br /><br />The very thought that &#34;free will&#34; may be an illusion, is not an excuse, but more of an eye opener. I believe that it is a better understanding of others and ourselves and help develop better approaches to issues such as crime and even education. Reading this book will make you think, and it may even make you feel a bit better about yourself once you can see you are where you partly by chance.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle edition and of the many highlights I made, I believe this one stands out the most: &#34;Many seem to have absolutely no awareness of how fortunate one must be to succeed at anything in life, no matter how hard one works. One must be lucky to be able to work. One must be lucky to be intelligent, physically healthy, and not bankrupted in middle age by the illness of a spouse.&#34; - &#34;Free Will&#34; by Sam Harris<br /><br />If you get a kick out of reading anything philosophical, or education, this book will certainly get your mental gears turning.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time they get this for the kindle. I'm highly addicted to this game. Good going Amazon and Kindle. Another great partnership. All I can say is THANK YOU!!!!!!

B000002H38|4.0|If you were around back in the day you surely remember the first time you heard Anita Baker's voice. It was sensuous, sublime and soulful and out of the gate, as a seasoned &#34;overnight sensation&#34;, she had an alluring, hypnotic and somewhat quirky style of performing a song, Accolades and Grammys followed but Baker's follow up albums had a sameness to the production and eventually she lost her audience. 'Rapture' is really her masterpiece. The gorgeous ballads are wonderful but the song that has always stayed with me is the more staccato, soulful &#34;You Better Watch Your Step&#34; at the end of the album.

B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|For whatever reason. I love SciFi & Fantasy but PR just didn't connect with me for some reason. I never felt like I cared about the characters. I found the cgi battles hard to follow what was going on. The creatures looked like they came out of the movie called The Mist and I thought the ending was too much of a cop out.  I did enjoy some of the humor. Hannibal was hilarious. The two scientists were kind of funny. The colors looked fantastic in HD. But the story didn't catch me so 3 stars for me. Entertaining but not great.

0385350864|3.0|I was a fan of the earlier books in the 90s and 00s, but this late-coming ending to the trilogy didn't quite ring true for me in places.  I knew about the big plot reveal from the press and I decided to make up my own mind and read it for myself.<br /><br />Bridget has aged in real terms, so she's 51 now.  A lot has changed in her life but she's still the same as she was when she was 35.  That was one of the problems for me, she hasn't matured at all.  I expect her to be scatty, but there were times when her ditsy behaviour became irritating.  For example, while she was in business meetings, she was constantly texting her boyfriend or nanny.  To be honest, I would have sacked as well.<br /><br />Having said that, the last third of the book was enjoyable and it was well written overall.  There were some funny moments, which compensated for the irritating bits.  If you're a fan, worth reading for reference.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Fantastic calculator, great features and functionality. The button swipe is pretty neat.<br /><br />It has a quality feel to it, the animations and tutorials just ooze polish.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very entertaining. Gets more difficult as you progress. Do wish they had a &quot;hint&quot; button. Overall quite challenging. This game requires some math skills, observation and logic.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I saw not yet, but I have hope that even better than before, and had no chance to see it on film, so in blu-ray if I can enjoy the theater-like ...
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Great book by great author. Could not put it away. One of the best books I ever read. Highly recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been playing this game for all of my life I recommend getting this game if you have a good imagination and you can get this game on computer at minecraft.net
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A book that I enjoyed reading and made me think long after. The story takes place in Australia, so some of the terms were unique but easily translated for meaning. I recommend highly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it! Recommended my friends to play. Need more levels! Never have rated an app before but this one deserves it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|If you like Steven king you will like this book.  He gave just enough info to remember the shining without going into detail or repeating himself.  Enjoyable
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I took u guys long enough to put it on Amazon, now I'm on my kindle all day playing candy crush, I'm addicted, now if only u guys would put pet rescue on I would never put my kindle down
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can't believe this is the last book, I really do wish there were more books that continued...I loved this book as much as the last to...can't wait for the movie to come out...everyone should read all 3 books
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Very imaginative, story was nicely written and told. The actors chosen for the roles seemed a natural fit. Saying the special effects were AWESOME is an under statement. If you are a fan of this type of movie, I believe you will be pleased.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Amazon was nice enough to give me 500 coins just for buying the Kindle Fire. I decided to buy Fruit Drop 1, &amp; liked it so well, I decided to buy this sequel. It's even better than the first, with new challenges. I loved it even more when I discovered I could turn off that annoying voiceover banner thingy, in the middle of the game. Yay!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|the speed of sending is very nice,the product is very good to sharp knife,it is designed very portable,a helpful product.
1423136802|5.0|I bought this for my 12 year old son to help him get interested in reading and complete his school reading log. He loved them and buzzed right through reading them...happily! Now his reading log is done and there was no arguing when I told him it was time to read!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Watched the movie &#34;Muscle Shoals&#34; last night. What an excellent movie about the origin and history of one of the most prolific studio bands in history. I was very surprised at some of the artists and songs recorded in the small Alabama town of Muscle Shoals and of the studio musicians from that local area. An excellent watch for everyone I highly recommend it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|So fun! Really cool game it great to play. My husband has fun playing the game and get the kids to play it too.
B0042XA2U4|4.0|This book was both funny and sad.  It was a well written and very enjoyable.  It would be a good beach book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever very addicting very colorful and fun to play if your looking for a fun game like temple run this is your game
0525478817|3.0|I am amazed at the praise that has been heaped upon this slight, albeit well-intentioned book.  I know it's a YA (and I am not Y anymore) but c'mon even from a young adult's perspective this is a glib, disingenuous story much more concerned with being clever and cute than meaningful. This is a sweet story but could have been so much better if the author had stuck with the core story and not gone off a tangent about the whole Dutch writer and the search for the book's answers (and some highly improbable interactions). More attention needed to be paid to the main characters and their relationship, their struggles with their health problems and their feelings toward each other.  To me it was glossed over and you are left with a somewhat average story that is far from the \\"damn near genius\\" that the TIME magazine reviewer gushed.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|This is album is freaking great! It isn't quite as mind blowing as their old stuff in that the bass tracks are practically inaudible over the new drumming style they've picked up.  Great songs with a darker feel.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|My only real complaint is that I can't request or give to all my friends, even though they show up in the top 3 at each level. Actually, I'd also like to see a plain list of all my friends in the game instead of just guessing.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|After reading about the many producers who worked on this album I was afraid this offering might turn out to be a hodge-podge release. Far from it. Almost all of the songs are great and even the melodically not so strong offerings are saved by the musical ideas and the brilliant production. Everybody who has ears must be aware that Paul's voice is not perfect anymore - but come on! He ruined it by singing songs like Oh Darling! Helter Skelter or Why Dont We do It on The Rod? for US. For 'Early Days' his ragged voice is just perfect and because of the great music he just keeps coming up with he gets away this time again. Hearing the songs I just don't care about his voice at all. Thanks Paul for keeping up doing it. For me and for millions of us yours is the best album of the year again. Grammys for this one!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|loved it when is season 3 available soon I hope cant wait for season 4 delivery is a little heavy for Canada
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|The story portrayed is simple but mostly credible. Rich in dialogue with sprinkles of landscapes and interesting sites. Slow in its development. Reminded me somewhat of &#34;My dinner with Andre&#34; which many friends considered boring. It makes you want to see the sequel.
B000I186FW|4.0|Must pay close attention to the story line, but eventually it does make sense. Special camera effects are of interest.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Sequels are always difficult. To improve upon something as terrifying as The Shining is asking for a small miracle. So King went more supernatural here and it works for the most part. Just wasn't what I expected. Characters could've been explored more too but decent enough story.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I thought the book was good but not great. The end is what I didn't like, I understand the whole idea is to entice readers to get the next book in the series, but I didn't like that the book had no end. You must read the third one to understand the ending of the second.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A follow up to The Shining, Doctor Sleep is a book that kept me up late, reading well into the wee hours.  Now a grown man, Dan Torrence is an alcoholic just like his dad was, with his own sad secrets.  When he stops in Maine to find a job, he finds friends, sobriety, and a little girl who needs him.  Combining their strengths, their 'shining', they try to overcome the 'True Knot', who are merciless killers of children.  Without giving away anything, suffice it to say that any true King lover will be mesmerized by the way the story unfolds.  An excellent read!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My 7 year old loves to dress her an put make up on her and play with her hair.  Everything she likes to do in real life but without the mess!
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|this is a great weather App. it function well on my kindle fire. the one I had before this app would not always load.
034580404X|5.0|I had already them them before but decided to buy my own copies so I could read them over and over.  :)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I'm about to read the book for the third time this year.  There is so much detailed information to catch and tie in to other parts of the book that I'm still wrapping my mind around it all.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was quirky and fully encompassed the voices of the main characters. It was deep without trying too hard since it was written from the perspective of the teenage main characters. It touched me, made me laugh and almost cry! I was hooked after about the second chapter and stayed up way to late trying to see what would happen next. I appreciated that the characters were as flawed and fumbling as real life. It has been a long time since I read a book that made me feel so many things, and I can truly say this is one of the most unique and best-written books I have read all year.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|As always Brandon Sandersons books are awesome and fun. Can't wait for the next one of this series. O ya
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|.This is the best game in the app store.  I'm so glad Amazon finally gave us the app for this game. It works perfect with the Fire HD.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app rocks. I love the challenges and how you think your never going to pass a level then you pass it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Maybe I was not as interested in the topic as I thought.  I now have a nice background of the subject and I will not have to do this again.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|The story is good. About a boy who thought he knew everything because he was smart and ahead of his time. He did not want to listen to anyone. However he was faced with the reality of his actions. Either he listened to his papa and made it through or his dad would die. It was all up to him. Good lesson for all boys.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was intrigued by the title of this book, I knew some of the history of the Orphan Train and this novel brought  it to life. I was engaged by the author during the entire read. She did a very good job of transitioning from the past to the present.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I couldn't even finish this annoying mess of a film.  Too loud.  Too much voiceover.  Why can't we simply watch a scene play out without Toby Mcguire's gushing all over it?
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Being I am a follower of Hendrix, Stevie Ray, and Santana,  Joe has yet his own unique style, including harmonics I have never yet experienced. Give this a shot.. you will never forget it!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Did I mention I love this game?!?  Seriously though, its a ton of fun and great exercise for your mind!  Its super challenging &amp; kept me busy for at least 2hrs straight!  No glitches; fab graphics; super fun!  *PLEASE MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS!!!!!!*
B00973DDN2|5.0|This is different from past albums in that there aren't the super catchy intros that really get your attention. But listening through the hole album and not skipping a song just because it starts slower than you're used to with the Killers, you really get a complete and solid album of music. It's evolved but very definitely sound like The Killers.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Ive played all of the &quot;Twisted Lands&quot; games &amp; I love them all. How can you beat the price either?  I'm very critical of games and these hit the mark everytime.  I'm not a huge fan of the H.O. portions of any game, so my only criticism would be that I wish there was an option to skip the H.O. puzzles if you wish to.  Don't take them out entirely, just wish you could skip if you wanted to.  Other than that- perfect!  Great graphics, long playing time, no glitches, great puzzles.  Love, love, love!! *Waiting for a brand new &quot;T.L.&quot; to come out!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun if you like puzzle solving! really good for passing time and keeping your brain sharp - recommend for all ages
B004FOA84A|5.0|In my top 5 favorite point &amp; click games!  No glitches; lots of play time for your money; above par graphics; fun &amp; challenging puzzles!  Great for an hour or two of fun!!
B00915G6R6|5.0|WHILE THE WHOLE CAST IS OUTSTANDING AND TO BE CONGRATULATED, JULIETTE MARGUILLES IS ABSOLUTELY SUPERB IN HER ROLE AS ALICIA FLORICK.  I CAN'T WAIT FOR EACH SEASON TO BE RELEASED SO I CAN WATCH IT AGAIN.  I NOW OWN ALL FOUR.

B000OJFV4C|5.0|Reading Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel - The Tudors are the perfect accompaniment. Well acted, scripted, filmed. Will be sorry when I reach the end.
B00FEN000S|3.0|even from video library it stops and has to reload 6 times. any solutions? We loved the movie but the reloading was a problem
B00ENCIDFA|1.0|This was the most boring season and a waste of time. The previous seasons were fun to watch since they mostly covered the period of time from Spartacus life about which there are no facts to verify the accuracy. The final season is a waste of time and is good only for 10 year olds. To get an idea here are two stupid moments from the movie: 1) Julius Caesar acts as some kind of commando, who gets to the castle, held by Spartacus, pretending to be a slave and helps roman forces to take the castle from within. Another laughable situation is when Julius Caesar gets raped by Crassus's spoiled son when they get into argument. The rest of the season is in this manner. They could have made the season interesting and educational if they have followed at least some historic accuracy, but instead they decided to make this a chip action movie, and after a while you get bored watching similar types of fights when bunch of rebels slay many more roman soldiers all over again. Also in the movie they show roman soldiers fight by running towards the rebels (the same manner that rebels do), and breaking their orders. Keeping the order and marching slowly towards the animal being covered by shields was the main advantage of roman legions, so why would they give away this advantage.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Great album best of the year! Just my opinion put it in and just press play every song is good and just get better as you go.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|By far Malcom is one of my favorite writers.  His books are fun and entertaining, as well as offering a ton of great information.  Definitely add this book to your list of must reads and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Can't wait for the new book; David & Goliath
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I love this movie so much. It's so fantastic and a silly classic. My childhood movies bring back such memories. The Emperors New Groove will always be one of my favorites
B002BRRTUO|5.0|My wife wants to own all Princess Aura's outfits! I'm in favor of this behavior. Great set design. A fun movie.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|awesome app, gave me back so much space and SUPER user friendly. really love this thing! definitely get this app.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I am writing to balance out all the people who were disappointed Bridget didn't change into a proper married lady, or whatever it is that disappointed them. I really liked it. It's VERY relatable. Bridget is still herself, which I was pleased about. It's very funny. It gives hope for anyone finding herself single with kids after a marriage. I liked it a lot more than I expected to, based on the other reviews.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|So much more to offer than LOR and similar books. Lots of treason and politics... Excellent book overall! You'll be hooked from start to finish.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I loved this book the Shinning was one of my favorite books and I wad so glad he wrote s book about Danny grown up with the Shinning.  Love how he brings back story lines from overlook hotel font miss this book
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I wish they'd make an official app for youtube. I've been looking for one for a while for my kindle and none work after so long. If you make an official app for kindle fires I'd love you forever
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swift key is fantastic. Didn't realize how much I liked it until my trial period had expired. The keyboard is larger and I like the fact that it remembers words and phrases that you have used previously. You don't have to spell the whole word to find out that it is misspelled or have auto correct insert something not intended to be used.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|EXCELLENT!!! I grew up with this story as a child and am so happy to be able to share it with my toddler who absolutely LOVES this story! Looks awesome on the kindle! It is exactly as the printed version! Such a cute story! Great colors! Very kid friendly! I highly recommend purchasing this book for your kindle!
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Bryson does it again.  One Summer does not have the personal stories found in his A Walk in the Woods or I'm a Stranger Here Myself.  It reminds me of Bryson's At Home, full of details.  (At Home is one of my favorite books of all time.)  Sometimes, a segue appears contrived, but it usually helps remind the reader of an unrelated contemporary event.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a joy to read.  I will read it again, I'm sure, in a few years.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This album is often referred to a Bowie's best, & it's not hyperbole. There is only one crap song on \\"Ziggy\\" & it's a cover !!<br />(\\"It Ain't Easy\\" sounds like a third-rate Humble Pie tune, but otherwise this is a seamless collection.) Even crazier, the best-known classic songs \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" & \\"Suffragette City\\" are not even the best songs on the album! I'm not sure anyone besides<br />The Beatles can compare on their albums to the consecutive quality of the first 4 songs on ZS. \\"Five Years\\" into \\"Soul Love\\" into \\"Moonage Daydream\\" into \\"Starman\\". Pure genius!<br /><br />Strip away all the glam trappings, & Bowie's larger-than-life image of the time & you have a singer/songwriter at his best. He combines the chord knowledge learned from Beatles & Dylan, then combines it with the simpler, punkier rock of Iggy & Lou Reed, circa Velvet Underground, to create this classic. You will hear many later artists copy Bowie's singing style, but none of them could come close to his songwriting chops of '71 - 74. Maybe Elvis Costello could, but he wasn't even an imitator. This may be the peak of DB's singing too. He can make his voice sound weird & screechy, or spoken like Lou & Dylan, cool, or really pretty. On \\"Lady Stardust\\" he puts so much feeling into the song about fictional characters, it sounds more real than pure autobiographical stuff he'd do later. A stone-cold knockout !!<br /><br />The bonus tracks are worth a listen once a year at most, but the rest holds up 40 years later w/ amazingly good production for 1972.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul never disappoints.  I loved the  single the first time I heard it,  And the album doesn't disappoint.  With great music and lyrics, the album is a gem.<br />I usually have to listen to any album a couple of times before I can enjoy it.  Not so here.  It is a stunner from start to finish.<br />Long may you rock, Sir Paul.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|To me this is one of the better apps out there for weather reports.  You can customize it to your local area and others. I use it almost daily and have it set to alert me when bad weather is looming. It is easy to understand and use. Might not have a lot of the extras like others but we do not miss it and it makes it more simple.

B00FAX6XQC|3.0|It's good and all but there is this energy bar you need to go on missions and it takes like 10 min to regenerate 1 bar so I can't play for  areal
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Suuuuuper long movie, but worth every minute.  It was so interesting and funny and action filled.  It was just so great! I dont know what more to say besides I highly reccommend getting this movie!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I gave this one star only because the system doesn't let you assign negative stars.  Save you money and don't see this video.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|I thought that this movie drug on for way too long.  In my opinion it was super boring.  There was no action and it was so quiet.  I do NOT reccommend it.  I guess maybe I had much too high of expectations, but oh my gosh.
B0041KXOVC|5.0|The film is a great film and difficult to come by any other way than via amazon. OK its a used item and nice condition but I was disappointed to see the cover sheet was for the French market and for me unreadable<br />On the plus side the disc plays well without hops, skips or jumps  so its ok
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I do love Denzel.  This movie was great, but not as great as I was hoping it would be.  I still liked it a LOT, but I don't know that it is one that I will watch again anytime soon.  If you want a movie like this with him, go get Unstoppable :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book proves that Stephen King still has it and continues to entertain his constant readers.  I really liked finding out what happened to Danny Torrance after all these years and to find out life was kept real.  He suffers from the same demons his father suffered from, alcoholism.  The story has twists and turns that propel the story along.  I was not disappointed but entertained.  If you enjoy King, by all demanded this one.  It will be worth your time.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Everyone has used the term &#34;page turner&#34;.  This is truly one you can't put down.  Mysteries have always been a favorite...I love to figure out 'whodunnit'.  It ends in an unresolved way....I sense a sequel.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A surprisingly well moving and interesting view of &#34;first century Palestine&#34; - the time when Jesus lived and that influenced his actions and words.  A well written and engrossing overview of that time and one way to look at Jesus the Man - looking at his words and actions based on the world then.<br />Even though we all know how the story ends - I kept looking forward to each chapter's details.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Non stop fun with candy crush saga.  The kids love playing this candy crush game.  Can't get enough of candy crush.
1476727651|4.0|One of the most anticipated sequels in recent times, Stephen King's \\"Doctor Sleep\\", a sequel to \\"The Shining\\" thirty years in the making, is one good yarn - better if read on its own merits. If compared with the iconic \\"The Shining\\", it will fall short. This one does not match the sheer claustrophobic terror of the original.<br /><br />Dan Torrance, the boy with the double-edged gift of the \\"shining\\" - that allowed him to look into people's minds as well as into the future, though somewhat hazily, had escaped from the Overlook Hotel with his mother, and with help from the Overlook's chef, Dick (Richard) Hallorann. More than twenty years later, Dan had turned out to be what he had never wanted to become - a peripatetic and a near-confirmed alcoholic, one short step away from the abyss from which he knew he could never return. After yet another episode of drinking, he gets on a bus and finds his way to a small town named Frazier, where he decides to stay a while, tending to Teenytown Railway - the the small town's miniature train - during its summer tourist season, and working at the local hospice otherwise. At the hospice he becomes known as Doctor Sleep, for his ability to ease the last moments of the terminally ill. At around the same time that Dan moves to the town, in a nearby town, Abby is born, a few months before Sep 11 2001. It seems that little Abra has the gift of the shining - a super strong power, in much the same manner as Dan Torrance, perhaps stronger. To complete the triangle, there is the True Knot, a roving band of people, always on the move in their RV trailers, never staying in one place for long, and, unknown to others, human at one point in time, but now humanoid vampires. They live on the \\"steam\\" of the young - the young who also happen to have the \\"shining\\". A prolonged, painful death of these \\"shining\\" youth \\"purifies\\" the steam, and the potency of the \\"steam\\" is the elixir of life for the True Knot. Abra, by the time she is about to enter her teenage years, catches the attention of the leader of this gang - Rose, and from there on it is a battle between Rose, Dan, and Abra.<br /><br />Going by some of Stephen King's other novels, like \\"The Stand\\", \\"It\\", and \\"Under The Dome\\" - all of which clocked in at near or over a thousand pages, this one is practically emaciated by comparison - less than six hundred pages. The plot moves at a fast clip, and with none of the detours that mark some of his longer novels. King's mastery over plot and pacing are ever evident here. The first hundred odd pages stand out for their ability to make your skin crawl on the one hand, and the painfully vivid portrayal of Dan Torrance's encounter with his personal, alcoholic abyss on the other. King seems to be drawing on a tortured well of personal experiences here.<br /><br />There is also a very \\"The Sixth Sense\\" scene at the beginning that in some ways is even more creepy than young Cole's night-time encounter in the movie.<br /><br />\\"He woke up needing to pee. Outside, a strong wind was blowing. It was warm -- in Florida it almost always was -- but he did not like that sound, and supposed he never would. It reminded him of the Overlook, where the defective boiler had been the very least of the dangers. ... Danny left the little room next to his mother's and crossed the hall. The wind gusted and a dying palm tree beside the building clattered its leaves. The sound was skeletal. They always left the bathroom door open when no one was using the shower or the toilet, because the lock was broken. Tonight the door was closed.\\"<br />Almost every Stephen King novel I have read has its share of memorable quotes. If \\"The Shining\\" had an impossibly vivid line like, \\"Hallorann's testicles turned into two small wrinkled sacs filled with shaved ice\\", Doctor Sleep has a somewhat more commonplace one-liner like, \\"I ain't got any relatives.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME BUT YOU SHOULD LET PEOPLE START WITH 25 KEY BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NICE AND EASIER FOR PEOPLE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS GAME!

1439163154|1.0|James Franco is a marginally talented actor. Beyond his work in Freaks and Geeks, though, I have not really been a fan. When I saw this book at my local library, however, I thought it would be an interesting read. When I saw that he obtained his MFA at Columbia and was taught by none other than Amy Hempel, I figured it had to be decent.<br /><br />I was wrong. So wrong and Palo Alto: Stories is now only the second book I have voluntarily not finished.<br /><br />The stories are feeble attempts at expressing adolescent angst but end up being boring, trivial and trite. It's Bret Easton Ellis without the scathing social commentary. It's a number of nondescript stories with interchangeable, cliched and totally unlikable narrators.<br /><br />I have read better stories in lower level creative writing courses. If James Franco wasn't James Franco, these stories would rightfully be gathering dust somewhere far far away.<br /><br />Not worth the time. Certainly not worth the purchase. One of the worst collections I have ever read. Stay away.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I could not put this down once I started.  It's an amazing insight into this incredible genius who has had such an impact on our electronic lifestyle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this.  It was easy to set up; set up in moments.  Easy to use.  It works flawlessly with Netflix but not Amazon Prime.  Most videos playing in the browser will display on the chromecast selected TV.  The technical through-put is excellent.  Playback does NOT stutter.  This is SO much easier than using the Wii to control netflix . . . . and I can work in another browser window without lag . . . marvelous thing.  I'd like a few more around . . .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game! I just wish gems were easier to get
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The author marshaled his fact very well and painted a vivid picture of life in the Holy land and the complex relationship with the Roman occupiers.  It illustrates the life of Jesus without the distortions of the Bible.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I honestly had never seen this movie entirely until now, but I love it.  It's a great story with lots of action and violence.  I love it!  It would have been worth the good price just for the beginning scene of seeing Arnold S. totally naked walking down the street at night.  What a body he had back then!  Darn but he looks good from head to toe in that scene!  This film has great acting, great special effects and even a tender, love story in addition to the science fiction aspects.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loves science fiction and action-packed adventure and great chases.  I can't wait to see the ones after this one though I can't believe they're nearly as good as this original one.
B000MV90IU|5.0|The product is of good quality. Moy are responsible, it fulfilled the expectations offered. I recommend them as sellers. They were very attentive in todod time.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|I'm a big Madonna fan.  I love so many of her songs, but this CD is a favorite of mine.  The subject here is sex for the most part, but I love the words and music to especially &#34;Bad Girl&#34;, &#34;Rain&#34; and &#34;Where Life Begins&#34;.  She made an exceptional video for &#34;Bad Girl&#34;.  It's exceptional in that it warns women about taking strangers to bed.  I like all the songs really, but &#34;Bad Girl&#34; and &#34;Where Life Begins&#34; (a song with clever wording that's talking about cunnilingus) are songs I like to play over and over again because the words and the music just seem to touch me in a special way.  An old standard called &#34;Fever&#34; is included, which is a favorite of mine as well.  &#34;Erotic&#34; is a great song although I'm not into S&M like the song is talking about.  There's also a song called &#34;What Do I Have to Do&#34;, which is a positive song about people getting along and having the freedom to live their lives as they see fit.  It's a great song with a great beat.  Warning:  explicit language is a part of some songs, but very rarely.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|Great novel!!!!! Read it when it was first published back in 89. Have gone on to read it 14 times!!
B00E8B1358|4.0|like the actors, like action movies, I can share with other to watch this movie. That's it no more comment.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Terry Pratchett never ceases to amuse me. One of his best so far. Funny, punny, and just an awesome story yet again.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I liked it!<br />I could have enjoyed a little different ending! But...  I wasn't the author!<br />To think Orphan Trains were a part of history !
B008YU0AOE|2.0|when using calculators for the first time I always check their accuracy. this calculator failed both the (1/3)*3 test as well as the (&radic;2)^2 tests. unreliable for any calculations that require precision.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|These cleverly imagined characters always give that perfect response - the thing we all wish &#34;we could have said&#34; when we found ourselves speechless in difficult situations.  I gave it five stars because it is pure, fast-paced, terse entertainment.  Suits is a rare auditory and visual creations that keeps us glued to our seats and hungry for the next episode.  And, it satisfies our need to share the human condition on many levels - every character is &#34;flawed&#34; - each has one small &#34;chink&#34; in their otherwise flawless social armor.  If you are now or have ever been a player in &#34;corporate America&#34; (or anywhere in the world) you will identify with one or more of these finely crafted personalities.  The breakthrough for the series is that it depicts characters simultaneously getting over themselves; triumphing over their most base thoughts or actions; and others who disappear in a blaze of pure evilness.  A most unique and relevant reason to watch a TV series - not to mention worthy of representing &#34;21st century&#34; business relationships.  Hope they film more seasons!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really love this game I thought at first it wad stupid but now I'm hooked. so thanks for a good tyme
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it is just so challenging. I love games that make me think ahead of each move
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun  puzzle game. It is pretty easy but entertaining. It was free and therefore a good value as well.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a little slow starting for me, only because it breaks chapters up by characters and I wanted to know what was going on with the last character.  However, all of the characters had something to offer and pretty soon I started getting excited to hear from the new person. A wife finds a letter to be opened in the case of his death with a life shattering secret, a lonely woman still grieving over her murdered daughter, another wife who finds out her husband is in love with someone else, a teacher who may or may not be a killer. This is at heart a book about emotional earthquakes and how we fight to make our way through them whole. And it's wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. Lovely.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I was impressed by the 2009 film and blown away by this one. Although I wouldn't/couldn't call myself a Trekkie, I do love Star Trek. I found myself grinning foolishly, getting goosebumps and having moments of downright giddiness watching this.<br /><br />The casting was brilliant. The acting was brilliant. Story was brilliant. The little hidden Trek quirks and twists were brilliant.<br /><br />Did I mention I found this brilliant?<br /><br />Khaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan!
B004TI5N38|4.0|For fans of jack reacher this is a good read and different spin on a military investigator-- good location-- good plot-- will follow in the future- Thoroughly enjoyed
B000ID37RM|5.0|Great movie.  Family friend played Scout in a play and she did a great job in pertraying in 1963 Scout with Gregory Peck.  Love Gregory Pecks character.  He stood up for what is right.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|another great album by Sara!!  I listen to it continuously and never get tired of it...  on a special note...  Google the 'reason' why she wrote her big hit &#34;Love Song&#34;... it's not what you think it's about!  :o)  LOVE THIS ARTIST!
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This film was a caricature of the original.  from the sets, to the story line (script, editing), to the acting, an empty shell of a film that seemed to think of film-going audiences as e, empty shells of people.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|the group of actresses / actors are a very fun group to watch, entertaining and nice to see 'the help' stand up to the snooty women that drag them down!!  one I could watch over and over again!
B002BX4VEK|5.0|I finally gave In and bought this album.  The background music by Chips Moman's session group is fabulous...that is 50/50 what makes this album.  I listened to some music when Elvis was at STAX, and the background music was awful compared to<br />this.  It is just too bad the Colonel got in Elvis' way again - and would not let him record there anymore.  OH, IF ONLY Elvis had had more of a backbone!!  This album is fabulous.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|I choose this rating because it was a good read and the author kept you wanting to read, stayed up late a couple of nights to finish, thanks
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried after I read this book but not because it was bad, no because it was one of those books that truly captures you and makes you  realize that life no matter how short it is is a miracle nonetheless.  One of the main ideas that the main characters contemplated was leaving a mark on the world, and it truly makes you realize that despite all output desire to leave a lasting impression we probably won't be remembered but we should still try to do things that are memorable. This book explores the possibility s of life after death. This is an amazing book that I bought for my kindle and I had it.finished in four hours because it captured me so. It will tug at the heartstrings and most likely make you cry but it is a magnificent book that every one should get a chance to  read.
B00ESNE696|5.0|Great show been watching since the series started and never missed a show. Hope it stays on for a long time.
