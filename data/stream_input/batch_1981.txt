1601251831|5.0|Excelent purchase, specially for the old school D&D players that didn't like the 4th edition. Very nice improved rules for the 3.5.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|I am very disappointed in Twitter. It is difficult to use, find people and the language is atrocious! I guess I am just not into the vulgarity that everyone thinks is so humorous and &#34;now&#34;.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is one of the best solitaire apps I have found on the market and the best part is the price, free! You can chose to play either a random deal or a winning deal.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|A history to fully illuminate the mild (and biased) history taught in public schools.  An unvarnished look at the economic adventurism that is the United States foreign and domestic policy.<br /><br />This is a complete examination of American History from the founding fathers on.  A look at the growth of the country and its governace since the republic began.  Told from the viewpoint to exposing the lies that neocons have told from the start of our government.  Equally damning for Repulican and Democratic administrations, the book takes a realistic look at the impact of policy on everyday Americans.<br /><br />Excellent and exhaustive this book is a must read for all citizens.
B000VUCIZE|3.0|I like my atheism a little more polemic. I like bomb throwing so to speak. Don't expect it from Sam Harris. His logic is flawless and he doesn't really appeal to emotions. Very tough on Islam, but Letter To A Christian Nation is a leaner and meaner tool for atheists.
0446554995|4.0|I believe Pendergast is one of my favorite charcters of all time, however,  either i am not willing to believe that nazis' are still out there conducting experiments or Preston/Child are running out of ideas for our hero to handle!
B00846REIS|5.0|The new fifty shades of gray.<br />So good and so hard to put down, finished it in one day!<br />Cant wait to start the next one
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I've given director Nolan and actor Bale three chances...and all three failed to excite.  My wife laughs hysterically when I do my imitation of  Bale's raspy voice as the billionaire playboy turned crime fighter.  This go round of Batman just over-hyped.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was one of the first books that I downloaded when I got my Kindle.  I read these stories twenty plus years ago and had enjoyed them then, so I decided that I needed to get this and to have another read.  While the language is slightly dated, the layout makes it an easy read.  My recommendation is to treat it as something you're going to read over time and not something to plough through from cover to cover.  The stories are interesting and with the return of Sherlock Holmes to both the big and little screen, relevant to understanding the great detective.  I highly recommend this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am really enjoying this show! I can't wait to watch Season 3. Well worth the purchase! Super Awesome Show!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so much fun - just like the arcade game! My kids and I love it and we play it all the time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I had seen it on the best sellers list for a while but wasn't so sure because sounded so predictable. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Just when you think it is going down the path of predictability it sprints the other way. I loved the twists and turns.  The end totally surprised me. Wow!  Totally recommend this!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This was very fun to play.  No directions, so just kind of winged it based on my previous Mahjong games.  Went through them all way to fast.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|just the kind of stuff i like. they should make more halo movies. This flim goes beyond the video games and tells you what some people, even kids thought of the war. Before the alien war was really known.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Great movie regardless storyline. Just filling space gggggg gggggggg gg ggggg gggg gggggg yyyyyy yy yyyyyy yyy yyyyyy yyyyy ererrrre aaaaa a aaa aaaaaaaaaa

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This product is super good. CM has always made quality products in the past, and they will continue to be superior in the future.<br /><br />Keeps my computer At around 35C constantly, 40Cish under a full load using prime95 to test.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|I am getting tired of films and TV shows that glamourize and glorify alcohol and drug abuse.  This does both.  The film centers around Captain Whip Whitman (played by Denzel) who miraculously crash lands a jetliner that suddenly starts to nosedive.  Before the plane takes off we see the Captain drinking and taking cocaine. Now the important thing is that the drug and alcohol abuse has nothing to do with the plane crash.<br /><br />After the plane crash the movie crashes. After the crash, Whip rids his life of alchol.  This is a great series of scenes where he goes through his grandfather's farmhouse (which he owns but is trying to sell) and starts by flushing his pain killers down the toilet and then bottle after bottle and six pack after six pack.  It appears that Whip is going to straighten out his life.  But then the film starts down the wrong road.  Whip goes to a meeting with his friend, now working for the pilot's union.  When he gets there he finds a lawyer (wonderfully played by Don Cheadle) and is told that there is a drug and alcohol report that states he was three times over the legal limit for alcohol and he tested positive for cocaine. If these results hold up, this means jail time.  My first thought is the film is going to be about Whip being railroaded and made the scapegoat.  But no, what next happens is he gets drunk and picks up a recovering drug adict he met in hospital (another great performance). Before the big finally, he is once again sober, its the night before his testimony before the ATSB.  He is in a hotel room, his mini bar is stocked with Coke products.  He hears a knocking.  He determines it the adjoining door.  He opens his side of the door to find the other side unlocked and he finds an empty room and a full mini bar which he proceeds to empty.  The next day, his friend and attorney buy him cocain to bring him around!  Come on without you stupid ending there would be no consequences for his actions.<br /><br />How can you make this worse, start making it preachy.  Whip and Nicole (Kelly Reilly) attend an AA meeting with an over the top preachy testimonial.  Then another preachy scene is when he goes to visit his co-pilot in the hospital. And it ends with when Whip has a chance to escape it all with one final lie he decides he cannot and finally tells the truth which puts him in jail.<br /><br />Now Denzel's performance is be hailed by many but come on its easy to play a drunk.  The better performaces come from Don Cheadle (and I am guessing many of his scenes probably wound up on the cutting room floor because he outclassed Denzel in every scene), Kelly Reilly who makes you feel that she is in love with Whip but will not let him bring her down and Tamara Tunie as the surving flight attendant who helps save the plane and then Whip.  These are the reason that I gave this film three stars and not Denzel or the script.<br /><br />One final note, John Goodman is one of the greatest character actors around but this performace is one of his worst.  So over the top (almost as bad as performance in A Christmas Carol at the Kodak Theatre).<br /><br />If you really want this film, I would say wait a few months and pick it up in the clearance bins at Big Lots.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Looks amazing on the fire and its free. Also you can actually see the tiles so clearly you can see which one is on top.
B003ES61EE|5.0|This item was as described and was of good quality.  I would recomend it to anyone for there own personal use.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I have, like most, read many good reviews of this stylus, deciding to take a chance and purchase it.  It arrived in beautifully designed, simple packaging - and importantly stress free in opening.  The stylus immediately struck me as probably the most comfortable writing instrument I had ever held:  I have large hands and the comparatively large barrel was perfect.  Added to the size was the wonderful rubberized coating, allowing a reassuringly positive grip.  Unfortunately, that was all the good I could find in the stylus.<br />In use the stylus has, as mentioned, the requirement of an initial downward pressure...I had thought this, before purchase, inconsequential, but in use it very quickly became very irritating.  Like all the rubber tipped styli I have owned (and at this point there have been many) the ease of movement against the screen decreased rapidly to the point that, within a month, I felt I was having to pull way too hard to move it across the screen - almost as if I were trying to work on a very dirty screen.  I also quickly found that the amazingly comfortable size of the stylus made it difficult to see the tip if I were trying to accurately place any mark or line.<br /><br />If comfort were the only measure of the usefulness of this product this would easily be my first choice --- since function is probably more important than style I cannot recommend this stylus.<br /><br />10-25-2013 (UPDATED REVIEW)<br />I have been meaning to ammend this review for a bit now but somehow that intention never made it to this review.  Let me begin by saying that every positive thing I mentioned about this product still, obviously, applies.  Based on this original review I was contacted by the OWNERS and they immediately sent two replacement tips.  Wanting to use the pen, because of it's comfort, I installed one immediately and found the difference to be incredible!  I have used the stylus daily since receiving the tips and I MUST reverse my opinion of this product.  I have found NO evidence of ANY issue and am ABSOLUTELY SOLD ON THIS STYLUS.<br />I also think it incredible that I was contacted by one of the owners of the company so quickly and within days I had my replacement tips and a handwritten letter, making sure that the new tips corrected my problem.  The personal attention from the company along with a \\"fix\\" for my problem are amazing.<br /><br />THE STYLUS PERFORMS WONDERFULLY AND THE INTERACTION WITH THE COMPANY AMAZING.  THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT I WOULD CERTAINLY RECCOMEND!I have found NO evidence of ANY issue and am ABSOLUTELY SOLD ON THIS STYLUS.<br />I also think it incredible that I was contacted by one of the owners of the company so quickly and within days I had my replacement tips and a handwritten letter, making sure that the new tips corrected my problem.

B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great movie! my boys (3 and 7) loved it and wanted to watch it again the next day! We rented this, but I would buy it for our home collection!

B008HTQ28K|5.0|An intricately magnificently written plot.Kept me guesiing -but a really most enjoyable read  which I really found most difficult to put down
B006LSZECO|4.0|Easy to follow ... very readable. I held back from giving it five stars, because of the strange ending. It was too hard to accept that this marriage would go on .. how could the husband every draw a relaxed breath knowing the sick personalith of his wife. And what chance did their child have for a normal childhood. Didn't he worry that she would damage the child's psyche.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an awesome space novel!  Well done!  I highly recommend it for those who crave an edge of your seat read.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My grandson loved this! He's very much in to dinosaurs and this one is great, but Scleich makes a number of dinosaurs in various sizes and varieties. All of them are very realistic looking, which is why my grandson likes them. He is 5. The ones that look like toys are not as appealing. He also loved the fact that the jaw moved.
B00009Z576|5.0|This album is a good album and is one of my favorites.The seller did a excellent job setting expectations and the CD was just as described at a great price.
0316069353|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again! I've loved every book written by this author and this one is no different. He does a great job keeping the reading involved in the story so that you don't want to put the book down! It's a MUST READ!

B001FB4VXU|5.0|I ordered this rather close to Christmas as a gift for my son. I was not able to locate this item in our local area so I decided to try Amazon.com.  The price was better than I expected and the item was delivered sooner than I was promised.  It was a factory sealed, brand new set of DVDs, as advertised.  They play well with no problems and my son is giving them quite a workout!  I would order this again.  Thank you.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|As always very exciting, but you have to wonder where it is headed. So many shows get predicable, I hope they keep us guessing.

B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I don't normally listen to the type of music that is compiled in this soundtrack but its like they found the best of all the stuff I don't listen to and put it into an album. Its amazing, the music is perfect for the movie, and just listening to in general.  I think if you really enjoy the movie you will probably enjoy the soundtrack, although I don't really care much for the little snippets from the movie (it tends to mess with the flow of the sound track for me), as a whole its very good. You're getting a variety of music in this smorgasbord of amazing tracks, like I said, if you enjoyed the movie and you want to revisit it in another way check out this sound track.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator on my kindle fire. Its so handy and easy to use. Better than the one on my computer. I would recommend this for everyone.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I thought it was far gittier than the Stalone version, which Ilike about it. It's a pretty simple action movie, and nothing overly special about the acting, but I thought it was well scripted and acted for what it was, an action flick.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|throughly enjoyable especially if you love period fiction with a mystery. would also recommend her other books as well, have read all four that I know off.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|No substance.  If a swearing teddy bear is funny, then you'll like it.  It got old... fast. Admittedly, I turned it off after an hour. So, maybe it got really good at the end.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|throughly enjoyable especially if you love period fiction with a mystery. would also recommend her other books as well, have read all four that I know off.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I gave this to my daughter for Christmas and she loved it.  She was in bed for a few days with a cold and she spent the time watching Castle.  She said it made her feel better.
B009X2CRMK|5.0|throughly enjoyable especially if you love period fiction with a mystery. would also recommend her other books as well, have read all four that I know off.
1451695195|5.0|I am a practicing physician myself, with a lot of interest in the fascinating matter of 'NDEs'. Dr. Alexander's book is very interesting, informative and eye opening into the realm of consciousness. His story without  a shadow of doubt is real, including his attempted scientific explanations, which just do not explain the vividness / clarity and richness of his NDE episode. The book is very well written, engrossing and I would very highly recommend it to all readers.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I was very pleased with my order. I also ordered the complete forth season at this time.These were brand new as described. They were delivered to my home on the first date of the, when to expect your order date. Very pleased. Have to love Big Bang and Amazon!
B005LAIHYU|3.0|If I hadn't read the book, I'm not sure that I would have followed this movie. Okay though, I guess.
158542627X|5.0|A book every one needs to read ! A book that will change your life. If we veiw what we see then we change.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|A lot of fun. I spend way too much time playing it. Will spend lots more time exploring more levels over the coming days, months and years.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Best book I've read in a while ! Definitely suggest this to many people !! Good for all ages !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so great a lot of people think its awesome and I'm one of them I love it!!!!!!!!!!
B00966TN1Q|5.0|Have read all the Harry Bosch Books. He is like a real person at this stage-  keep the stories coming
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love this cd. I already knew I loved it since I had already bought the sheet music. It was brand new so there were no defects.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|A visually stunning marvel of a film that will leave your heart aching for the realization of humanity's potential. From the lofty heights of Tibet's mountaintops to the mega scale  workforces of the modern factory floor, we are swept to a conclusion both sad and profound. Not to be missed.
B00003CXCD|5.0|It is a fun movie with tender moments, hilarity and light heartedness with a bit of sadness at the end, love the movie.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Another can't put it down read.  The Ryan's save America one more time and readers will once again wonder how secure the world really is.
B002GHIPYI|3.0|The sound quality of the head set was good, and the construction was solid. The only problem I encountered with the headphones was that the packaging had damaged the foam ear pads by chaffing a hole in the material, This was the condition of the item when recieved.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Another excellent episode in the season 2 series!!<br />Can't wait for the next one.<br />Too bad it's ending for the season so soon....
B00999DFP0|3.0|The only reason I am giving a 3/5 instead of a 5/5 is the description said the dvds were like brand new, just unwrapped but never used. The last dvd was still in the package just like the description, but the second season had a few scratches which made the episodes skit. If they had never been used like the description said,I wouldn't have had this issue.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Awesome book!!! Can't wait to read the next one. It's such a great concept and story line. But I'm not watching the movie until I read all of the books :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I gave the final book 5 star rating. It was a good way to end the trilogy. The battles between the districts and the Capital and Kay's mission to make President Snow pay for his crimes leaves you up all night waiting to read what happens next. Ending the trilogy was a bit sad but 'after all there are worse games to play.'
B002P5XXQG|5.0|Great record if your fan of the blues. Its got that same edge that you expect from older bluesmen but with a much greater enthusiasm. If you play your records often, I would recommend that you get the standard record or a 180 gram if you can find it. The picture disk, although playable and decent sounding, is not quite up to par to the traditional black vinyl.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Keeps u wanting more. Hard to put down. The sexual aspect of the book is a little much but I just skimmed through it to get back to the story.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|These movies are great fun.  The characters are strong and the humor is great.  I look forward to the next movie as always.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|using this product made me feel like I was really learning how to play the piano. I would recommend this to my 9yr.old son.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Once I get started it is very hard to put down!!!! Addictive!! Very good time killer while waiting tor anything.  Give it a try.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is the first book I've bought for my Kindle, at the suggestion of my son. We both enjoyed it very much. The ending was worth the week it took me to get through it as Mr. King tends to be a bit wordy...great overall!
B004QPOVE6|5.0|This was a gift for my son. Although he hasn't completed watching, he has enjoyed the blu-ray thus far - no complaints!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing bingo blitz its fun I just wish you would get more bing credits without purchasing them win more
1449415881|5.0|For those of us who are trapped in a life of cubicle employment, Dilbert is nothing short of our idol.  He says what we all think every day, day in and day out.  We all have our own 'pointy haired boss', know of someone who could be a Wally clone, and have encountered many of the personalities Dilbert encounters during his daily adventures.  The calendar itself is awesome but does provide a depressing reminder of how many days we have left in our cubes this year to put up with everything that Dilbert does.  I have to have my Dilbert desk calendar and get one every year just to help me find some humor in my own daily drudge.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game but i wish it would give more bubbles in some of those levels instead of having to purchase them all the time. other then that its a very good game
B009O2XY12|1.0|They want money to move on....so it is not free!  It is fun....but not what you think it would be.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was great, I wish it had been longer. I cant wait to see what else comes up.  Thanks G5
B000007XUQ|5.0|I am so glad I ordered this CD, the Carpenters Christmas collection.  I can't think of a better collection of Christmas music sung so well, and the arrangements, decades later, still can't be beat.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So many good characters & plot twists abound.  Jessica Lang is awesome!!!  Jessica and Lily Rabe should get Emmy nominations
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love the amount of difficulty that it takes to get all three stars. There is a definite puzzle concept that i like because it makes me think. the game isn't hard by any means. you can move through the different puzzles pretty quick.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Great movie with good plot and story. And, even if it is from and Indian company, the lack of never ending musical scenes was refreshing. Getting on with the story and forgetting the over/artsy parts was fantastic.<br /><br />This really is a film you should not miss, even if you have to use the subtitles to get the dialog.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much.  Graphics, storyline, characters ... all were great.  Will definitely play this one again!  G5 did a great job!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Add this to Bruce Catton's and Shelby Foote's books on the Civil War and you will really start to realize the effects that war had on this country, and, indeed the world.<br /><br />Wonderful read.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The previews for this movie shown in promotions were the only funny parts of the movie.  While I found the movie entertaining, I think, minus the adult language and content, it would be a better PG or PG 13 movie.
B000Q7ZNDG|5.0|This is the only complete filming of Shakespeare's greatest play.  Branagh's decision to create a visually stunning and complete version of Shakespeare's longest play makes this the premier version of an oft filmed work.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a very fast read. i can not wait till the movie comes out. I LOVED IT SO MUCH!
B005HP2JAM|5.0|The mastery of simple drawing in these cave drawings is stunning. The 3d adds to the experience and showcases the talent of the ancient artists in utilizing the undulating canvases of the cave walls. Excellent documentary interviews add to the educational experieńce.
B00A9X7X6C|4.0|Good performances and an interesting story made this well worth the view. Those trying to solve the mysteries on non-linear time through plot details of this movie are way over-thinking it. This is entertainment, not physics, and at that it succeeds. And let's face it - if your a guy - you could watch about any movie with Emily Blunt with the sound off and it would still be pretty good.
B004APVI1G|5.0|You must see this movie in 3d. Forget any plot criticisms you've read in other reviews and lose yourself in the majesty of this fantastic environment where owls realistically converse, where you fly aside feather and blood creatures, and beautiful light permeates every vista.
B008Y6MKSW|5.0|Great movie with deep themes and awesome comedic moments. What I love most about it is there's no limit to how many times this movie can be viewed. You will continue to find subtle and interesting details even after dozens of viewings. This one joins a small group at the top of my 'can always watch this' list.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Thought provoking look at life after death, as experienced by a former atheist neurosurgeon who became a Christian after his own Near Death Experience.
B0015AARJI|5.0|No other charger comes close to the actual sony brand.  It is not cheap, but worth the extra expense.  SIXAXIS is the way to go, other controllers don't come close for control, especially in shooter games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A wonderful series that draws you into both the world of priviledged society and the world of those of serve them.  Highly addictive!
B0079R8KXG|4.0|The only draw back is if you want to play certain games than they are up side down, ( if you put the charger connection on the outside so it can charge closed.)  If you have it turned that way this doesn't effect the camera. but it does effect certain games. It stands well at most angles. I am happy I purchased it.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|This is just like the soundtrack for the Lord of the Rings. Howard Shore has done it again. Epic, beautiful, moving...there aren't enough words to adequately describe it. Just buy and enjoy the treat to your ears.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|It was a little gross at some scenes - nothing outrageous, but he stitched his dog back together...  yuck.  Not Tim Burton fans, but our son wanted to watch it.  He liked it, but we won't watch again...  the story line didn't make up for the weirdness of it.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|I love her music. I listen to it over and over and never tire from it. Her music is therapy to my soul.

0486411818|5.0|this is good book for who is interested in FEM as a mechanical eng. Only drawback is no more examples, but when u compared price and quality, it worths five stars.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|after seeing the movie, wanted to read the book.why do you need so many words in a review. sometimes more is less
0345803507|4.0|I liked all three but the last book was the best of all would recommend to everybody would not try this item again
B00005JMCW|3.0|I have seen this movie many times and this was bought for a friend who likes this movie. Very good price and fast shipping....
B004T4LUPW|4.0|The fact that it synchs so easily with my Google calendar makes it EXCELLENT in my book.  The only thing that would be nice is if the color \\"widgets\\" were more straight-forward to use.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I live in a location where almost every heavy thunderstorm results in power outages.  I am spoiled.  I still wanted to be able to read when that happens.  There is enough light from this cute little lantern for my unusual purposes.  You can also hang it from a lamp if you have a lamp that extends.  Perfect!  Ok, so it was meant for camping.  You can do that too.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|I truly did not want to stop reading this book. Hobb continues her Farseer series and draws me into her universe easily--and lets me reelish every second of it.
B00432QAKK|5.0|This 2010 version is better than 2011 version. Since the cd's in (2011 version) are stacked on top of each other and are easier to get scratched and the (2010 version) each cd is clipped in their individual cd holder n they just overlap a little of each cd.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|i totally love this app . I've had trouble for what seems like ages falling asleep but since I've purchased this i sleep like a log . the sounds are relaxing and somewhat hypnotic and totally block out the background noises of my neighbours and the traffic outside . totally recommended . give it a go,it will surprise you .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It seemed very good.  I did like it and I think I might even finish reading the other two books.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Love the idea I got 4 movies in 1 box. Great for teenagers that don't put anything away. Love the movies but the language could be a little curbed.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|When you are ready to stomp in \\"naw Or'ns\\", grab a poor-boy and a tall one and crank that brother up!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|At first I was like no but the I thought about it and i was like ehhh what the heck????
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet ut so far I find it quite intriguing.  Since it was written by a physician, it seems much more legitimate.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|It made me angry, and happy, sad and hopeful, it inspired me to follow my dreams and succeed in all that I do. I loved every minute of it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The script, scenery and actors are supberb! I can't wait for each episode and never know what is going to happen next.
B004T340QY|5.0|We just love this movie.  It has dozens of imminently quotable lines, and the retelling of a classic tale is always welcome when it's well done.  All the actors are wonderful, and the romp through depression-era southern scenes is beautiful to watch.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|As with any other movie, it's a subjective thing.  If you enjoy the Napoleon Dynamite-type of show, you may well enjoy this one too.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|I got this to play rmvb video files on my Kindle Fire HD.  It indicated I needed to also download ARMv7 neon to play these files.  I tried this but it then said this was incompatible with my device.  I then tried the ARMv7 (without the neon) version and that one worked.  The only thing I would like is for it to display the video file name in the list of videos I have in my folder.  So I use ES File Explore to find and open my video files.<br /><br />Update:  After trying this Media player on more movies I found too many do not have the voice synchronized with video. The difference is enough to be annoying, so I have reduced my rating. This rating applies to rmvb files only. I have not tried it on other file types.
1419705849|3.0|This book continues the series and was given as a Christmas present.  The gift recipient is very pleased with the book and it completes the series up to date in his collection.  This title was purchased from AMAZON since I could not find the title at a brick and mortar shop near my home.  It was delivered without damage on time for gifting.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|excellent feel good movie with depth<br />visually gorgeous<br />I would recommend this movie<br />the cast is incredible<br />that is all
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This is good, but the beginner needs to use two hands and some of the songs are really long.  You have to work up to get better.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|I never rate movies, but I was inspired by how bad this movie is. We stopped the movie after 20 minutes. I wish I could have my money and those 20 minutes back.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is like the angry bird game, but you can't get the extras. i.e. get larger, shake the earth, larger sling shot.  etc.  it makes it harder to play and more technique is needed to break down the walls.
B005XLN77O|3.0|Got this for our 5-yr-old and she liked it but lost interest VERY quickly.  That being said, she is not all that into Barbie dolls at this point so once she had made the dresses (which took about 20 minutes total) she had little to no interest in playing with it further.  Dresses fit the doll well but the 'glitter' accents are simply stickers and they come off the finished dresses very easily so they end up on the floor instead.  If your child likes to play Barbies, though, it might be a great purchase for the price since the kids get a kick out of the fact Barbie is wearing their design.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This starts out good, then becomes harder to and you can't get more balls.  Fun for a while, then gets old
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I have downloaded this on the recommendation of Sharon Vaknin. Have not yet used this, but it's there if I need it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Best item for kindle I've ever had.  Great ability to write, take notes, easy to read,  calendar works well and keep everything where you left off.  Saves everything as you want to save it.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|In regards to the actual book itself, George R R Martin spins a wonderful tale, probably best book(s) I have ever read.<br />In regards to the medium, just love it, especially with his amazing vocabulary, find myself constantly looking for the meanings of words.<br />Overall am very happy with purchase, thoroughly recommended.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this second book of the Hunger Games. It was a very quick read....one of my first Kindle purchases. If you liked the first book, you'll like this one.
0670034711|5.0|I got this as a gift for my wife and she loved it.  She read it in a weekend and loaned it to our daughter, who liked it so much she bought her own copy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Maybe it was because this was the final book of the trilogy, but this was the best book of the three....in my opinion! Lots of twists and turns.....emotions were on a roller coaster! If you liked the other two books, you'll LOVE this final one!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought it was really entertaining. It had a great story line and the graphics were awesome!  I recommend this game!!
143353083X|4.0|This is a great resource but the print is very small. Will not keep me from using it, however. I will most likely buy another copy at some point in time with larger print. Arrived on time and in great condition.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I would give this 4 stars because I believe it had a good story line and overall was a good watch. Even though i don't care much for Shia LaBeouf he was ok in this movie.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|i love this app but it doesn't have enough levels. More levels please!! that iz my review!!! don't know what else to write!! bye:): 
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good app for free, ads at start of each game but what do you expect for free.  Worth the time to download
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The author took a different route on this one. The interview type style of this book is unique yet satisfying.  There isn't much room for character development but the overall story is engaging and literally gave me the chills over and over. A great read!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|Loved Gone Girl soI thought I would give this a shot.  It isn't terrible, but it isn't great.  It's just...strange.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone that liked the movie A Walk To Remember.  The acting is good, and the setting is beautiful.  It is about loss, love, and forgiveness.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Can't tell you how much I enjoy this DVD collection of Whitney's music videos.  I would buy it again if I ever needed to.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great movie, brought back memories of being a kid and going on adventures with my cousins in my grandparents attic and basement, looking for 'treasure'.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was one of my favorite recent reads. Alice, an intelligent, successful woman develops early onset Alzheimers. This novel gives a poignant glimpse into Alice's experience with this horrible illness.  Looking forward to more books by this author.
0525952926|4.0|\\"Fall of Giants\\"--  the first installment in Ken Follett's 20th-century trilogy-- was a complete failure.  Concerned with the upheaval that World War I provoked in the lives of ordinary families across Europe, with the social and political struggles of the period, it proved a dull and confusing morass:  Neither engaging as history nor a good novel.  Although a faithful Follett fan, I almost didn't buy the sequel.  That would have been a mistake.  \\"Winter of the World\\" is a promising return to form for Mr. Follett.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Winter of the World\\" tracks far too many characters.  The struggle to follow the fortunes of twenty different characters prevents the reader from caring too deeply about any of them.  This is not always a bad thing.  Some storylines-- Lloyd, I am looking at you-- are almost torturously boring.  Each time the story returned to his home or family in Wales, I groaned.  It is ironic that the Welsh-born Follett is incapable of rendering the Williams family and their troubles even remotely interesting.  The frequently didactic and preachy tone of his writing does not help.<br /><br />Follett's true gifts lie elsewhere:  In representing the miserable and alienated, the violated and dispossessed, characters who lose everything yet continue to fight because they will not admit defeat.  From conceited Daisy and troubled half-brother Greg (children of notorious Russian gangster Lev Peskov), to Greg's paramour, aspiring black actress Jacky Jakes (based, I believe, on historical figure Dorothy Dandridge), to \\"eligible bachelor\\" Chuck Dewar, incredible and inspiring characters lurk in the pages of this book, just waiting to draw you in.  Follett is far more capable than most authors of any sex of created raw, dynamic female characers.  Neither lofty saints nor lowly whores, never just pretty faces, his women are real human beings.  Sometimes when I feel lost or discouraged, I think of Aliena, Caris, and now Daisy and find new courage.  I recommend this book to you.book to you.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I loved this movie because it is visually stunning... like a gorgeous music video... which is why I bought the blue-ray edition. After watching the deleted scenes, I can now say I also love this movie because it's a good story. I'm sure I can blame the MPAA for why so many necessary scenes were cut from the theatrical release. It would be brilliant if they'd release an unedited version so I could see Mr. Snyder's vision in its entirety.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simple to use, good looking, and big text so easy to see. Nice helpful hits on Calculator for you to read too.  I would recommend to all.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The music isn't pretty, it is raw, and it is what the words are really talking about.  I highly recommend the soundtrack, though it is best when you see it.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|When I got my Kindle i felt one of there weak spots was no word processing. This app hits a home run on word processing for me. Highly recommend it. My kids downloaded it too. (they know more than me)
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I am addicted to this series.  I bought season one for my father, and I hope he likes it as much as I did.
B004GYY714|5.0|I use it alot, love the talk radio most. Works well. does not seem to matter how good a signal you have, or at least for me. listen to sations from around the world.  I recommend.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I love the subtitled versions of the trilogy, but this one was also awesome, and I loved that the film sped through the first part of the novel which just dragged.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Never used it, downloaded it, and as it was doing that, i read where alot of folks thought there battery lasted way shorter after downloading this app. so i delete from device.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|The book just did not live up to my expectations.  I  am a Canadian and I lived in Saskatchewan for many years.  Methe<br />problem was tuoched on.  The characters waere hazy and depressing.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|very easy to use, free. If you ever download other apps other than the one company, (there are alot of good ones out there) this app shows all your apps in one neat spot. Still learning how to us it, as I'm a new tablet user. I recommend it.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|A great book that's lived in my heart for years.  Smooth, human.  Ever inspireing  The Author hops illn and out of the story in such an intricit way.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The story begins at the exact moment where the last book left off and it takes the reader on a whirlwind adventure. Constance Green, Proctor, and Corrie Swanson are all a part of the story as well as some new unexpected characters! A fantastic read and a most satisfying ending.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I loved seeing season 2 of Downton Abbey on my IPad, but the constant buffering and momentary loss of video that occurred throughout made it a real trial.  Love of the show gave me the patience to get keep going with it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|LOVED IT!  Hugh Howey is an extremely talented writer.  First I must say, that one should read the WOOL series before FIRST SHIFT.  The WOOL series is written to keep you reading for the answers to many questions that you will have right off the bat.  Hugh Howey knows how to keep his readers hooked, giving just the smallest bits of information to fuel your curiosity to know more.  His characters are real and likable and the story line is thought provoking.  Just read the first few pages and you will be hooked.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I really like this app because of really nice interface, and unlike others, it has a sleep timer and alarm. This, and spotify, are about the only online music apps i use anymore(goodbye pandora). Just a few features, that i've been looking for, is all it took. Great job!
B0035WTE2U|4.0|I only owned the live album of AC/DC and really wanted a studio album of their best songs. Although I'm not sure all songs on here class as &#34;their best&#34;, it definitely is a great collection to give you a taste of their work.
1423140605|5.0|Steph's rating: 5 stars Dani's rating: 5 stars Overall rating: 5 stars<br /><br />Steph's Review:<br /><br />JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE TO RANT AND GASP A LITTLE AFTER THAT DANG CLIFFHANGER ENDING RICK RIORDAN. WE HAD TO WAIT A YEAR FOR THIS BOOK AND YOU DROPPED US ON OUR BUTTS AT THE VERY END. I never knew how much the term \\"cliffhanger\\" could apply to this book *nudge*. The wait for the next book is going to be a long one...*sighs*.<br /><br />In this book, the representatives from Camp Half-Blood have arrived at Camp Jupiter. There is lots of tension between the two camps, but Riordan tones it down a lot by giving us the cutest Annabeth and Percy reunion scene *squeals!*. Oh in your FACE Reyna! The said \\"seven demigods\\" in the prophecy are confirmed in this book, and they take off on their flying trireme/airplane to complete the quest of saving the world and their friends yet again, despite the skepticism of the Roman camp.<br /><br />A lot of the questions about the Great Prophecy are answered in this book. You learn what has to happen for Olympus to be saved, and it created a nice outline for the events that will happen in the rest of the series. Don't think that just because we can expect what's going to happen later means that this book isn't packed with the action that  Percy Jackson fans love. There are plenty of fight scenes, lots of sarcastic humor, and plenty of...quite swoony scenes that I thought were a bit uncharacteristic for Riordan's writing, but were good anyways. Don't fret, they are between \\"that\\" couple from the previous series &lt;3. A certain pale boy with a black sword comes around, and there are these twin dwarf-giants (yes I know, an oxymoron, but you will understand once you read the book) that dress up in tutu's. Well, actually only one is obsessed with ballet and tutus. Oh, did I mention they are male-giants?<br /><br />I'll go ahead and do a character run-down:<br /><br />Percy: I think I love him even more now. He was so sweet towards Annabeth even though he was under so much pressure from his personal problems and the quest. Going strong as always! *smooch* *wink*<br /><br />Annabeth: Her reunion with Percy was soooo cute! Just think of typical Annabeth and how she treats her Seaweed Brain, and you know what is going to happen. Even though she has Percy back in this book, Annabeth is more alone than ever because of this mystery \\"Mark of Athena\\"...but you go girl! You will think of chinese handcuffs differently after you read this book.<br /><br />Frank/Hazel: Their relationship was pretty \\"meh\\" to me. I still like both of them...but I felt they weren't essential to this book.<br /><br />Leo: You rock! I love you! Please don't feel alone, your ship is awesome, and you are hilarious and ingenious! And no, you are not an idiot. Leo's relation to Hazel/Sammy is revealed in this book...and it is kind of a wide-eye moment.<br /><br />Jason: He felt like the Roman version of Percy here. His worries really correspond to those of Percy's, and I think that he and Percy will really be good friends in the future. I never knew he was younger than Percy though.<br /><br />Piper: She was kind of annoying. The only thing she really thought about for the majority of books was her bf/gf relationship with Jason. She didn't become useful until one life saving moment of the book in my opinion.<br /><br />Gaea: BI*CH. Please excuse my profanity.<br /><br />  This book was just as amazing as all of the ones before it. Actually, I think it is the best installment of \\"The Heroes of Olympus\\" series so far. Despite it's few minor faults, it deserves every one of those shiny 5 stars. Recommended for: everyone. Whether you like mythology or not. I can't wait to see what Riordan has planned in the last two books!<br /><br />--Steph and Dani @ A Walk on Wordsh even though he was under so much pressure from his personal problems and the quest.

B008IZYW3U|4.0|The CD is great though I now regret not purchasing the DVD for a full kinaesthetic experience to appreciate the language
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I like this game but there are too many problems.  First of all, when they call the last number, the game does not allow you to cover the number on your board.  I have had many,many bingos on the last number called, but I could not put it in.<br /><br />Secondly,B's are taken away even if you have not played them.
B007704HO6|5.0|Still reading but enjoying the book immensely!  I have 3 male orange tabbies, one of them is a stray that reminds me of Bob.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|S. Collins has integrated fiction and 20th Century horrors so skillfully while taking the reader into the totalitarian violations endured by the young innocent heroine. How much in-depth research the author accomplished is to be admired for her vivid view of the country is naught but a thin disguise for Hitler's Nazi Germany. There are too many similarities between the machinations of both regimes, the eventualities of using families, the intense technological mania, and the dearth of a moral center or respect for humanity ...these are not prerogatives of artistic creativity alone, but masterful interweaving of fiction and historical precedence.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I grew up on Led Zeppelin, so of course I'm a Jimmy Page fan. Haven't really followed The Edge/U2. This is a fascinating doco/rockumentary/homage to the guitar. Watching 3 generations of guitar interpretation was really interesting. The look on The Edge's face when Jimmy Page played the opening riffs to those classic Led Zep songs was priceless ! A combination of awe, respect, humility - in fact all 3 displayed the same reactions. It was also interesting to watch Jack White holding his own with Page and Edge - his back story was great -  making a guitar with a bottle and some wire, getting a mouth organ custom fitted to his guitar etc<br />A brilliant idea to put these guys together<br /><br />Jenny
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I downloaded this to my sob tablet in hopes to try and figure out how to transfer files from my micro SD card it worked great
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was absolutely perfect. I love it! I think they should make a second one if they already haven't!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a really Fun game me and my son just love it so much. We fight o er who's turn it is to play
B005R7DAWG|5.0|Better read the book than to watch a movie if one wants to know and understand the great minds of that time. This one leaves you feeling yes, intelligent, entertained, a better person... No greater stories can be written with so many words...<br />Advanced learners of French will learn structure of phrases in a classical language.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is the best game ever. It is so addicting me and my four year old son fight over who's turn it is to play it lol
B00005JPLW|1.0|I had such a high expecations while watching this movie but towards the end I was highly disappointed because the DVDs get very sketchy and froze a lot.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great read! But, it would have been nice if Katness and Peeta made up at the end of the book.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love the 3D version! They made a great movie even better!  It seems the characters are in the room with you.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This movie had lots of laugh out-loud moments.  I found the musical arrangements to be very entertaining.  Being a 30 something guy, I'm probably not this movie's target demographic.  However, I liked it.  The only negative for me is that the humor tends to be off-color, bordering on vulgar at times.
0765325950|1.0|Waiting so long then told there won't be an ebook available until April because of the unfounded and unsupportable concern the book wouldn't reach the top of a best sellers list?  Lousy idea thinking Robert Jordan would have such a petty concern.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I'm a huge Tom Clancy fan - not sure how much was his work; but, definitely fell short of his normal work.  Book had a good premise and continued story line; however, it fell short at the end as it seemed the author tried to wap multiple story lines up in just a few short pages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I adore this book so much i loved every word every second of the book its a great read im waiting to see whats the next book that colleen hover is going to captivate me with love her awesome book great cryer butterflies in your tummy!!!!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The movie was good.  Nothing amazing, but good.  A little confusing at first with the whole time travel, but then it is fine.
B004UJCWF8|5.0|I read this book back in high school and just re-read it. It's so well-written and Maupassant just touches on so many issues from Marriage, Love, Family, Religion, Money. It's a great read!
0439023491|4.0|Great fun and wonderful descriptions.  Thought provoking with a moral.  A quick read, I passed it on to another friend.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I loved this movie and I feel it is such a good motivation to live for God and how to do it. The dedication of making commitments to God in one's life first and foremost. Shows how lying is not acceptable in a job and trusting God to help you decide to do what is right even when someone is desperate for a job and even when your family is pressuring you to do wrong because of the need for money coming in.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|as always Nicholas has done it again--he holds your interest all through this book. the lucky ones is a good story
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Even though I lived through this time, this book gave me a better understanding both or the time and of the consequences.  King is a WRITER.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Although I enjoyed the Fifty Shades series, the Crossfire Series is so much better written. The characters are well developed, the love scenes are not repetitive and the action moves swiftly along. I couldn't stop reading I was so caught up in what was going to happen next. Definitely a keeper, you'll find yourself pulling for Eva and Gideon' s relationship inspite of the pain they each keep inflicting on each other. Run don't walk to add this series to your book shelf.
0679805273|5.0|My parents gave me this as a High School graduation gift and I still have it many years later.  I purchased one for each of my children and am having each of their teachers sign it as they grow.  We will give it to the kids when they graduate with 12 encouraging notes from their teachers and a special note from us!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a book you definitely want to add to your keeper pile. Once started you can't put it down. Can't wait for the next in the series. So much better written than the Fifty Shades Series. The characters are better developed, the story is stronger. If you enjoyed Fifty Shades, you will love the Crossfire Series.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This book was a quick and enjoyable read.  It was very cool to learn some of the secrets of detective work.  I would definitely recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just when u thought the Hunger Games was a really good read now comes the second book. It starts out a little slow but then bam it grabs you and u can't put it down.  Can't wait for Book Three!!!!!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|It was impossible to put this book down! I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out!
1402786360|1.0|If I read the other reviews better I would have saved myself some money. This is really for taking baking to a different level of decorating. I like cute and fun decorating ideas. This is not what I was looking for. With a name like Sprinkles (I) was thinking cute and fun.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|We bought this movie as a gift for our daughter.  She has watched it over and over again.  The DVD was in excellent condition when we received it and plays well!  Great communication and response from seller when I had some initial questions before purchasing!  I appreciated it a lot!  Thank you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great for the short pauses in life.  It is easy and entertaining.  The game unlocks new games quickly, so I never get bored with it being repetitive.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful....full of songs . Highly recommend<br />Songs are wonderful, good listening, arrived in quick fashion, love it....tops<br />Great for your collection
B000AARKOO|3.0|Beautiful sets, costuming and I enjoyed the story line especially the parts that came closes to actual events in history. I liked it that they didn't portray Saladin as the bad guy. Ghassan Massoud was excellent. I enjoyed the battle scenes, loved Liam Neeson’s role, sadly not long enough but Orlando Bloom played a convincing Knight. Great story if not a little weak in a few areas. I loved Jeremy Irons as Tiberias and I didn't know that it was Edward Norton who played King Baldwin until afterwards! I hated Eva Green’s role and acting It was the weakest part of the story line but I thoroughly enjoyed Bredan Gleeson as the arrogant Raynaald of Châtillon!
B00338QENI|4.0|Very interesting subject, I enjoyed reading it and will recommend to friends. I like order from Amazon as delivery is timely.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|I have always been enamored with the Robinhood tale and the way King John has always been the villain throughout history. As a novice student of history I have a different take especially on how Richard has always been lauded as a great king and leader but actually was a horrible king more interested in warring on his own blood and pursuing his personal needs then anything else, I mean he spent a year out of ten in England? Where John was viewed as a better king, at least from the sources I have read.<br /><br />I liked a lot about this movie from the sets, to costuming, and the portrayal of the common man and woman in England. I especially enjoyed the acting done by Mark Strong, Kevin Durand, Max von Sydow, and blown away by Cate Baanchett. The movie lost me at the end when she was charging into battle, armored and leading a pack of young kids. Aside from that it was good, even though Crowes accent was horrible. I also got a kick out of Danny Huston as King Richard. If I ever had to imagine what the real Richard was like it would have been as Huston portrayed him as.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is worth the seven dollars. In creative mode, your building abilities are ENDLESS! I can't wait until the next update, coming in February of 2013.
B00009ZYBY|4.0|I enjoyed Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenixs roles in this movie. Being a fan of the Roman Empire it was awesome to see the sets, costuming and weaponry of that time being used. It was especially cool that the forest used in the movie was actually burned down as the country apparently was going to anyway for some clearance or project of some sort.
B001AW156U|5.0|Seems to really help. I haven't played much with them yet. As long as they stay attached I think they will be fine.
030758836X|5.0|The plot was laid out to perfection. I am a veteran reader and I devoured this book trying to guess what was next. I went from hating one character in a chapter to loving them in the next.<br />Would  make a great movie.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|I use it to have it read my class notes to me while driving.  A big help in studying, highly recommended to people needing to review documents while driving.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|This book was a good read. Holds your interest without being to graphic in the intimate details. This book is ok.
0525951652|5.0|I am 1/2 way through the book and it is exactly what I had hoped it would be. It has a terrific interweaving of characters and stories against the background of actual world politics. It is entertaining and informative.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|this series is slow going. so far it has great expectations in the story line but i am afraid it will never get to the point.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Great game. Hours of fun. In fact I required the black suit by earning spiders throughout the game. Didn't have to spend money once. As good as the ps
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grisham's best! this is a must read book for all John Grisham fans. John, I can't wait for the next one.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Great game. So much fun to just gather moves and Gadgets. Vehicles suck. But you don't need em. Would be nice to access them after completing game.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I love it.  Its one of the best albums i have heard in a very long time.  Most artist are putting out albums with only one or two hits.  I liked every, and i mean E V E R Y, song on here.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Definitely not what I was expecting but in the BEST possible way. Mr. Sparks could do no wrong. Suspenseful and beautiful...highly recommended.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I didn't think it lived up to the Bourne Series.  I like both of the actors but I think the script was poorly written.  Jumping on rooftops was on the Bourne Ultimatum.  Not very original. I actually found it a little boring.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I havent finished yet but I am loving this book.Any Stephen King fan I highly recommend it!It is phenominal!I love this book!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|From the previews you think you know what Looper is all about, but there is a twist.  I liked it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing!  I love it. Rick Riordan better write House of Hades quick! A great captivating plot will keep permanently hooked.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Great quality, arrived sooner than expected, great price.  NO SHOPPING MALLS OR HUNTING FOR PARKING!!!  I could just kick back and watch a favorite.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Writer-director Christopher Nolan's ambitious conclusion to his &#34;Dark Knight&#34; trilogy suffers from an unwieldy script, a disappointing villain and not enough Batman for its 164-minute running time. On the plus side, Anne Hathaway rises to the occasion as Catwoman. No match for &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; — let alone the Tim Burton installments — but visually impressive and fitfully entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting material (even if you've seen the movies.) I really appreciate the plain style of writing. Teen books do not have to be filled with over the top snoring as this one proves!
B0055S348W|2.0|You can't print e-mails from your primary e-mail account unless it's Google. So the program us usless to me since that is what I need for me to print e-mails from my tablet.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|What's not to like about the Lion King! It's a well established child's movie that grandmothers enjoy watching as well.
0575083093|4.0|There is obvious brilliance in the sheer scope of the ground covered in this novel. This isn't your average light SciFi reading experience, but a murky journey into unfathomable depths -- all created by a writer with a truly fertile imagination.<br /><br />That being said, one can only wish that the editing was as brilliant as the writing. The storyline, afflicted with far too much dialogue and attention to insignificant detail, takes forever to get to the point. A trimmed-down version of this story would have ranked among the all-time genre greats. As it stands, Revelation Space is wondrous on a conceptual scale, but strictly pedantic in its execution.<br /><br />Cautiously recommended, but be prepared to do some strenuous wading in deep waters.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This movie has good action and it may be a slow pace here and there but that's the point to set up the story and on how the X-men became The X-Men.Can't wait for the sequel coming out in 2014.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it. easy to use. Nice to find old and new friends.not a lot of down time ever! Has a ton of information
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A quick and easy read.  It captured my attention right away.  You can't wait to see what happens to Pat.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It was entertaining, exciting and will keep me looking forward to the next installment. I will nw rent Thor and captain america
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I enjoy strategy games, but before I played Settlers, the game's description sounded boring.  Once I played it twice, I loved it.  You need to play it a few times before you fully internalize the rules, but once you do, it is a lot of fun.  I bought Settlers as a Christmas gift for my family.  We have a great time playing it, and I would highly recommend Settlers for other families that enjoy playing strategy games like Risk or Axis and Allies or card games like Rook or Euchre together.<br /><br />Two things that you should know before you buy this game are that it takes a while to play and that you need competitive but relatively patient players.  Games of Settlers take our family at least 2 hours and usually about 3.  Your first few games as new players may take even more time.  However, games go considerably more quickly once all players have experience.<br /><br />Settlers of Catan is a terrific game; give it a shot!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|I would watch it again I thought it was so funny- My wife. I really enjoyed the whole movie! End
B00004YRQA|5.0|This memory card serves it's purpose well. It is just as it is described. They 8MB of memory has been sufficient to save games for four gamer and multiple games.
0765325950|5.0|This book is the perfect payoff for the series. It is incredible how long/big the climax is. I guess when a series is this long the climax can be 900 pages long!! I don't see how any story could ever top this series. Well done Jordan. Well done Sanderson. Well done Harriet.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The cast of charactors was well thought out, the scenery was breathtaking and I enjoyed the happy conclusion.  It was a feel good movie for the whole family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved Downton Abbey Season 2! I found watching it very addictive and can't wait to see Season 3 soon.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This is the second lifeproof case I have bought. The first one I am still using on my phone and it does terrific. I bought this one for my wife for Christmas and it has been a big disappoint. The sound quality is awful. The speaker sounds distorted and garbled and the gasket makes a questionable seal. It was such a bad by that we have since returned it. I don't know what happened. I am so impressed and satisfied with the one I bought a year ago, but this new one couldn't compare at all. I don't know if they have changed something with their manufacturing but this was not the same quality I bought before.
1451613512|3.0|The history has enough truth to pull one to an unsupportable conclusion.<br /><br />Have we been lied to...? You had better believe it!<br /><br />One could only wish for a keener intellect whose agenda was not to merely attempt to push one to the left...willingly into new Tyrants.<br /><br />Voltaire said that history was a Mississippi of lies!<br /><br />One can not help but get the Idea that the writers of this book have no Idea what America is really all about or have any great understanding of the Founders intentions in creating a State where the \\"Rights of man,come not from the generosity of the state,but from the hands of God.\\"JFK<br /><br />Socialism and Communism and Fascism,all rob man of his Human Rights.<br /><br />The Authors of this book seem to miss that point.
1934030554|5.0|This book has been very helpful in my training. Easy to read, objective, practical. If you are a professional or not, I recommend it.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|i love this game but i am sick and tired of being forced to replay the tutorial all the time
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome story! Good character development and imagery. As a teacher, I wanted to know what the fuss was all about... glad I did.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book. I loved Enders innocence and determination... I love the build up in the story and it has a great ending that did not make me want to throw my kindle against the wall. Ha. Great for sci fi lovers, war story lovers, and just a good book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|please try it its fun for all ages theres tons of levels give it a try it can be pretty simple at times and hard at times so it evens itself out
055338466X|5.0|I get more than I expected. It's very good for me. I recommend the products in 100% for all that can get it.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Excellent movie. Jeremy Renner is awesome as usual. I hope they do more sequels with him. My only complaints would be that the ending was too abrupt and Rachel Weiz's character was not strong enough.
0553385461|5.0|I get more than I expected. It's very good for me. I recommend the products in 100% for all that can get it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have other devices that I frequent Facebook with, occasionally I use the Kindle Facebook app.  Overall it's ok but there's something I can't quite put my finger on that I don't like about this app.  Especially in the way that it displays pictures.  The one thing it has not done is cause problems on my Kindle Fire HD 7, so its ok.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Prepare to laugh, cry,scream, and fall in love.  Wish it didn't have to end.  Never felt so many emotions after reading any other book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this!  You can pick up and do one or twenty, depending on you and your time allotment.  Some are fairly easy and can be solved in a matter of seconds; others a matter of days.  This really challenges your logic and your ability to reason. I got this for both my parents who are elderly and it's a wonderful tool for them to keep their minds sharp and working!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Exactly what my son wanted.  Needed an extra controller for his PS3 and this fit the bill.  Recieved quickly and as per advertised.
B004J64QR4|4.0|The only thing that prevented me from giving 5 stars was the performance of Nick Jonas, whose voice and stage presence are merely adequate, whereas the rest of the cast and their performances are simply....stellar.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Very Entertaining on original Kindle Fire. I have over one hundred apps and this is my first review.  The only thing I wish this app had is a constant visible compass because now you can only view the compass by pressing the inventory (heart) button.<br /><br />I own Minecraft on PC but can not use a keyboard to play games. Xbox version is easier for me and I like it but Block Story is excellent because it gives you goals which I enjoy.<br /><br />But I gotta ask What is with all the Earthquakes?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is one of the best A.D.E experiences I have ever read or heard. It is very different than the others, which makes it so unique. I highly recommend this book.<br />Doris M. Aubinger-Hebert
B002M9WW30|5.0|This was ordered as christmas gift for my IT son.  Ordering was easy, the product recieved was correct and the item arrived quickly even before the scheduled date I was given.  Everyone happy.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has no resemblance at all to what sexuality between two  people in love constitutes. I cannot recommend this book at all in all honesty.<br />Doris M. Aubinger-Hebert
B008ELUEQC|5.0|My favorite holiday music, listened to RS everywhere this past holiday season, really enjoyed this CD.  Thank you for the CD!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly makes potentially boring detailed research sound interesting and he injects just enough of Bosch personal like to keep him human. This is not a &#34;page turner&#34; but I did not want to put it down.
B007SWZVBQ|4.0|but some of the people singing the songs were strange picks- for instance Lea Michelle for I won't give up by Jason Mraz? but still good
B0049DRH28|1.0|If the streaming version, which is also available for download, has subtitles only and does not offer the English translation featuring Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and Alfred Molina, then the Amazon.com page you select and order from should say so. I dislike the fact that I was misled, and that if I want to watch the translated version I will have to pay more money for the DVD.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I have ALL of the Glee Christmas albums. Kevin McHale singing Feliz Navidad is well worth the price of the album!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Price: Awesome<br />Cooling: Awesome<br />Size:  Ginormous<br /><br />The price and cooling makes this worthwhile. But you must account for size.  Go for it if you are the geeky type and you want great cooling at an awesome price.  Stick two computer fans on this bad boy and do whatever it takes to get it on your CPU.<br /><br />It works as described, but it's HUGE.  It's like wielding a double handed sword, especially with two fans attached.  I mean you have to have a minimum of a mid tower that's roomy or larger to pull this off.  Works best for custom computer builders with mid-towers or larger.  I wouldn't bother getting this for anything smaller, seriously.  Also, you really need to have the type of computer case that allows for access to the rear of your motherboard precisely behind your CPU area, otherwise you will need to remove your motherboard  and probably a million cables plus a video card just to install the back plate which is absolutely necessary for this hulk of a metal air cool system.<br /><br />Installed this big guy for two different towers and it fit, barely.  Cools my AMD's like crazy, especially when you add two fans to this engine block!  Much better than stock fans by orders of magnitude!!<br /><br />Biggest problem related to size:  It is so big that I had to eventually go to liquid cooling. Why?  It's monster size covers two of the four memory slots on my mother board and I recently wanted to use all four memory slots to make my motherboard scream at 32 gigs of memory!<br /><br />Works as described, but gee whiz I think it is just better to go with a liquid cooler.  Liquid cooling gives me the room I desperately needed.  But if money is a serious issue (always), go with this and sacrifice internal computer real-estate in the name of monster engine block like air cooling!
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|My husband keeps wanting to know why I buy the albums as well as the downloads- I just love the music that much! My favorite on this album is probably the Warbler's versions of My Dark Side and Live While We're Young. LOOOOOVE the Warblers!
B009VB7P6G|4.0|as my 5 year old daughter tells me &#34;I hope I dont start crying&#34; at witch time my eyes are watering. The movie had a lot of obsticals and alot of overcoming. My daughter watches it every night.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a gr8 book i loved everything i i i i i i i i i i i i
B0091LS07E|3.0|Loved the song. did not care for the album. I was expecting more upbeat songs. I would not recommend this purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was impressed with this book.  It really did suck me in and kept me going.  It was beautiful, heartbreaking, yet inspiring.  Sky, what can I say.  That girl was so strong, so heartbreaking.  She has attitude, spunk, determination.  And Holder?  What teenage boy is like that?  He was so mature, compared to EVERY 18-year old boy I've ever known.  But that's ok, he was perfect for this book, and perfect for Sky.<br /><br />So, leaving out the spoilers, I'd say this book is worth a read.  However, don't expect your usual teen fluff.  This book is gritty, raw and will have you in tears, your stomach in knots.  It's in your face, yet at the end, you still have to cheer.  This is one of the few books, of the hundreds I read every year, that I put down when I finished and didn't pick up another book for TWO days.  Which for me, never happens.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was the first book I have read by this author.  I was quite different than any other books I have read, but enjoyed it, will read more Mitch Albom books.
B006O6F932|4.0|My grand-daughter loves it! She's crazy about all the Monster High products but she asked for this to play with her dolls. Bought this as a gift from Amazon at the best deal on line! It is fairly easy to assemble with instructions & diagrams. Better made than a lot of plastic products and folds for easier storage!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to admit, this is my first trashy novel and I am hooked!  I will definitely buy the other two.
6305428522|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  I thought that it was well done.  I had to purchase it as an assignment for a film class, but I'm glad I did.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love this book. Every person that I have told to read this book loves this book. If  you are looking for something different that read this book.
B000PMG16U|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson.  He had #3, but needed 1 & 2.  It was much cheaper to buy the box set for him than the 2 movies by themselves.  He was thrilled to get them.  They play very well.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|Almost every song is great. It includes most of their featured songs. I could upload all of the music to my Google Music account which is a bonus.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|He is just just just stunning! Una Mattina is the album that you need to buy if you are into slow style piano. It helps listeners to calm and concentrate. Also helps listeners to meditate. Absolutely beautiful album. Very worthy to buy!
B005NPCJ88|4.0|I purchased this based on the suggestion of a friend. This wasn't normally my type of music but it is really good.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love love love these books. I bought it for my Kindle and it was very enjoyable.  Katniss is a strong lead character.
B005QPGHQU|4.0|An overall good album. Lots of good songs, and I can upload the music to my Google Music account which is a major bonus!!
B004LWZW7O|3.0|The story was original and not quite like anything I've seen.  It starts strong in a future where you wear your life on your sleeve (literally a count down exists on your arm and if the clock runs out, you die) Got your attention yet?  Oh and you don't age past 25 or something so everyone is young and good looking.  Rich people have a lot of time, while poorer people end up dying in the street.  Good concept, but it somehow manages to become a futuristic Bonnie and Clyde.  I picked it up for $5.99 on blu ray/ dvd combo pack, so it was definitely worth that price :)
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is important. It details the life of an extraordinary man who overcame very tough odds to having any life success at all, yet through the power of his faith, his family's love, and sheer strength of will saved thousands of lives. He dedicated his life to protecting innocents. I am very grateful. I pray his family is well-supported in every way, physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Blessings to them, and thank God for the United States of America.
B009369Z8A|4.0|Jessica Chastain is amazingly talented in everything that I've seen her in, but its Tom Hardy in this movie that completely makes it worth watching.  It has a great cast and definitely keeps you entertained.
0061928356|5.0|Stirs up so much emotion. It has so much heart. I have to force myself to put the book down each night!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have been using this app for almost a year and I love it.  It is easy to set and has lots of options.  I use an alarm Monday that runs Monday through Friday and several alarms that I set periodically.  Plus, you can't beat the price!
B002P79KAC|4.0|I enjoy this show.  It is funny and intelligent and snarky.  Penny doesn't have to be quite so dumb, but...
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Tim Burton stuff is always weird, no exception here.  It's kinda creepy, my kids had a strange look on their face the whole time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have had my Alarm clock for about two weeks and love it . From the reviews I read I was not sure it would  do what I want and what I read but to my surprise it does.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Beautiful story that you can't put down! Easy pager turner that keeps you deeply involved with the characters and plot
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am thinking it was the writing style that made the book not as enjoyable to read as many of the others I have read.  I had heard so much about this book and finally spent the money.  I was disappointed.  The woman was certainly psychotic and he wasn't muchd better.  I actually had a hard time finishing this book.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Foul mouthed nonsensical tome of no literary value or any other value to anyone.  She is funny and talented.  Should stick to TV and movies.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|Easily one of my favorite trilogy, don't know why i didn't have it eariler. awesome gift for any spider man fan
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Jack Ryan series is getting a bit tiring.  Thought I could pick out the parts actually written  by Clancy who still is one of my favorites.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Good family movie my kids 11 and 6 liked it and adults enjoyed it also. A few funny moments during the movie also
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The movie was good but the action jumped around a lot without much explanation. If I hadn't read the books first I think it would have been very hard to follow
B006W0QR1S|1.0|The trailer presented Drive as more of an action film but only a few scenes are. Mostly it is filled with the Director's overly long pauses and overall It feels like the proverbial barge being dragged across the sand. Nothing much is given to understand the main character and the others are flat. We found it strange and meaningless.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Classic, funny and witty. Because of this movie I want to go back and read the book. It's classic Wes Anderson style. I highly recommend this movie for all ages.
B005DNSJB6|5.0|Have seen versions of this movie before but this is one of the best.. Highly recommend it - John Hurt is excellent...
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|First read this book as young a child,another classic and still a firm favourite as a great grandmother.  Mary McGrath
B004DM0UII|5.0|Got this app free through Amazon's free of the day promotion and it works great.  Growing up in the 60's and 70's I like the older tunes this app gives you just as much variety as satellite radio without the addition cost.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was everything everybody raved about exciting, fresh, and intense. I could not put the book down. I will say if you are going to read the first book have the other two ready for you will need them.
6304806434|5.0|always have liked this movie so i looked up on here and order it. it came sooner than expected. Love it
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Classic Ridley Scott. Great special effects. Wait for the last scene. More episodes to come. This is just part one.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great little game to pass time with.  I rate it a four only because Flow:Bridges adds the little twist in thinking and deserves the five.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm so glad I started reading this book on a weekend. Once I got into it, I could put it down! I glanced at the clock and it was 4:20am and I hadn't been to sleep. This is honestly one of the best books I've read in a while. I loved the characters, especially Holder. I read some reviews that state the writing style is juvenile, but the story being told from a teenage girl's point of view. I wouldn't expect her to express herself like a 40-year-old woman, that's what makes it seem real. The story was surprising, wonderfully told, and brought tears to my eyes on several occasions. It one of those books that really stays with you long after you've read it. Highly recommended! I think I may have a new favorite author.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|An awesome read! Put a smile on my face and took me back in time to my childhood crushes!! Remembered many of the stories. Could not stop reading. Good to fill in the blanks that I didn't know from 80's media and magazines.  Loved seeing the pictures while reading John's story..a very well written, heartfelt look into a great musicians career and life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put the book down when began reading. Felt like I was in the story at times. Very detailed!!!
1400052181|1.0|First of all, I am not interested in this subject, neither do I understand it.  I didn't get the dialogue from her children.
0345803485|5.0|This book was great!! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Yes, some of the parts were shocking and I am no prude but I really enjoyed reading this book and have passed it around to several friends.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Some of it was boring, with all the details I almost forgot who the good guys were and the bad guys.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having Pinterest on my smartphone and my Kindle Fire. I can get my Pinterest fix anytime I want. I have told several friends about the app and many have also downloaded it to their electronic of choice. It works on my smartphone and Kindle Fire as well as it does on my laptop.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is so intriguing. I loved it. I couldn't stop reading it. It's an awesome book and great story line.
0345803493|5.0|This book was no where near as good as the first. It didn't draw me in and keep me interested as much as the first.I was really dissapointed and all my friends that have also read this series agree with me about book two: BORING!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Great Movie.<br /><br />If I get a chance I must see this again soon.<br />Very refreshing movie.<br />I recommend this movie.
0345803507|5.0|Did E L James run out of things to write? It sure does seem this way with this book. Who would have thought an author could write andget produced a 3rd book in a series with almost nothing but e-mails between the two main characters? I am dissapointed that I wasted my time. I finished the book but only because I wanted to finish the series.
B004ISVH6G|1.0|Very old hat.the guy has been around long enough,surely! Old school guitar work that is repetitive and boring. the lyrics are childish-HO HUM.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had originally got this game for my child, but it got me addictive. This game will definitely keep you coming back
B003EYVXSW|2.0|The premise of the movie should have made for a good storyline.  DNA splicing resulting in Chimeras and other hybrids is still fairly new in experimental science, however this &#34;thriller&#34; was old, dull, and predictable.  Adrien Brody's great acting talent was wasted in this so called drama.  It seemed as though the actors were not taking the dramatic portion of the storyline seriously; it felt more or less like a tongue and cheek presentation. The only portion of the drama that worked, and was believable, was the sensual attraction the male geneticist's character (Clive) had for the experimental hybrid (Dren).
B005LAII80|5.0|Number one, i do not enjoy seeing movies in 3D in the theaters, because A) i wear glasses and 3D glasses dont fit well over them. so the whole movie i am uncomfortable fiddling with them. and B) the 3D glasses make the screen darker, and you lose detail. and i don't see that big of a difference.<br />But Dredd was one of the only 3D movies that i completely enjoyed, and feel like i got my money worth, the 3D was awesome, and i feel like this is one of the only movies that you should have seen in 3D over the 2D version.<br />I have never read the Judge Dredd comics, but i knew who he was, and the Stallone version ruined my interest in Dredd, so when i saw this faithful remake was coming out i was excited that Dredd would get a pretty cool kick ass adaptation. Karl Urban does a great job on Dredd, and he keeps the Helmet ON, he isn't like the Vain Stallone who had to show his face the whole movie, Dredd never takes his helmet off. this movie stays true to that.<br />This movie is AMAZING, and a movie i feel that i can watch over and over again, the action is plentiful, the story moves along well, the characters are great, the Slo-MO is the big highlight of the movie, and the Score is really good. if you have the choice to buy one movie this month this would be the movie to get. GET DREDD!!<br />i am disappointed that Dredd did not perform well in theaters, but that is because America does not really know the Judge Dredd comic's, so they ignored it. but you don't need to be a comic fan to enjoy this Great movie, that i feel is very faithful to the source material. i really do hope that they make a sequel to Dredd, the movie ends and you want MORE. hopefully Dredd will gain a Cult following in Bluray sales and they will decide to go ahead with another.<br />So DO NOT Pirate this movie, Dredd deserves every penny, so buy this Bluray, it is awesome, and the Bluray has the standard and 3D versions on the same disc. and it comes with a digital copy too, i travel a lot everyweekend, and this is a movie i will put on my iPad and watch on the plane!!!<br />Dredd is my Favorite movie of 2012 and there were a lot of great movies, but this one made me want more!! i am thinking about reading the Comics too now!<br /><br />Have a Great day, and i hope this Review helped you buy this KICK ASS movie, that is one of the best Comic book adaptations to date! :)
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Best thing levitt ever did!  Great script, good special effects - didn't rely on them to carry the movie but they punctuated it very well.  Bruce did okay, too.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I expected this to be more juvenile in the writing. That was what was said to me before I decided to try it myself. I liked the book, so much so I had to order the other two. I thought the storyline was interesting. A strong woman against an egotist. Proves you can't believe all you hear beforehand. I highly recommend it for people who don't judge others for their way of life.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This product works as advertised and more. It worked  it is supposed to in no time. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Didn't know what to expect. But it was a good syfy thriller!!!!<br />I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This product works as advertised and more. It worked  it is supposed to in no time. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love this cd so much I have been listening to it pretty much everyday since I got it!!!! I got it brand new as stated. Awesome cd! Thanks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book because it made me feel like i was really there. I couldn't offer you a better book choice . I definitively recommend you to read the entire series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the app cause it uses the full screen and I can see the numbers clearly and it is simple
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book because it made me feel like i was really there. I couldn't offer you a better book choice other than the first one in the series lol. I deffinitly recommend you to read the entire series.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I am not much of a Dub-step fan but added with Lindsey's violin music I found they really compliment each other.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|We got this as a baby shower gift for my second son. It was a clear winner from the very beginning, having to compete with many new and even more old similar toys (inherited by his older brother). This is the only one that would keep him engaged in his crib, so much that he'd eventually doze off and sleep (what a bliss!)<br /><br />The giraffe is the only baby toy I still have hanging from his crib now that he's turning one, and he occasionally stil plays with it. Highly recommended!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read plenty of books and everything from classics to SiFi. This is a great book! Well written and an engrossing story. Well worth the price. Seriously, at 99c check it out, and that's not from the library!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Find camera very difficult to use.  very difficult to focus on subject with no rear view view finder.  Very poog engineering on this particular issue.  Should have other video chat apps bedside skype as well.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and I have enjoyed how challenging it is.  I haven't spent any extra money to buy DNA traits, etc. but have been able to be successful on my own.  Love it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am a craft person and have found many tutorials to download with this app.  Great instructional tool especially when teaching some of my craft classes.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This book made the sun prime mortgage and eventual financial crisis wast to understand and follow. It also made it interesting to read. I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book, and all good things, so I was a little hesitant because often I find the reality does not live up to the hype. But as soon as I finished reading, I just set the book down and thought for a minute. I loved it, and it definitely lives up to the good things I've heard so many people say about it.
0870703781|4.0|You will have to consider the work in the context of the time and the author. The photographs (with a few exceptions) do not stand by themselves as well (IMHO) as the omnipresence of the name might make you believe. However, as a historical and pioneering work, it is a must-have book.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I wish I could say I was wowed by this movie, but I wasn't.<br /><br />Of course, I know it was too much to hope for another film in the Alien franchise.<br />I don't know which was worse, not getting another Alien movie or being teased into believing I was because so many people were calling this a \\"prequel.\\"  I call that false hope.  A pig in a poke.  Let the buyer beware!<br /><br />That aside, I will admit that I liked enough of this movie to keep it in my collection (but nowhere near my Alien set).<br />What I did like were the sets (what I could see of them in all that darkness), the added attraction of the Engineers, Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and a totally unrecognizable Guy Pearce.<br />The story was fairly basic for a sci-fi adventure: you board a vessel, get to where you are going, mayhem ensues, death everywhere, end of story.  Evil being without and within the group was also to be expected and was handled in a perfunctory fashion.  Personalities within the crew weren't allowed to develop because heaven forbid you give your body count some character traits.  I will add that there was just enough here to make me want to watch a sequel, if and when they ever get around to making one.<br /><br />But I still want another ALIEN movie.  I think we're owed that for having to put up with this poor rip-off.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I read the whole book, but kept hoping it would get better.  It didn't!  I will probably skip his books in the future.
1932735410|5.0|Very helpful book. Presently using it to asasist me in preparing for my PMP Exam in March 2012. I recommend this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a big Grisham fan.  I read &#34;The Racketeer&#34; shortly after it's release, and I was not disappointed. I had trouble putting it down.  How wonderful it is to have a really good book to read.
B007NZDES0|4.0|My and my husband's favorite DVD to watch together is Sade &#34;Lover's Rock&#34; DVD.  We have watched it for many years, so when we saw this one, we were a little disappointed.  There were many of the same songs that are on the other DVD and they did not perform one of the biggest hits from the &#34;Soldier of Love&#34; CD which was &#34;Your Daddy's a Fling&#34;.  After watching it a couple more times, it is growing on us, but it is still not as good as &#34;Lover's Rock&#34;.  Sade is getting older and her voice and performance showed it even though she is still definitely not past her prime.  Anything that Sade does is worth a listen and a watch.  She is a great peformer.
B003B02PF4|5.0|This is the second time I've read &#34;The Broker&#34;.  The first time when it was first released and then just recently, because I love John Grisham's books  and I really wanted to read this one again.  It was just as good the second time around.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|very interesting, insightfult and educational talks.  Great for passing time while cooking or cleaning.  Would recommend this app for sure.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|House at the End of the Street was a scary movie which held my interest without an overabundance of blood and gore .
B00005O3VC|5.0|I bought the DVD because I have worn out the VHS version I had for years.  This movie was my introduction to the Pythons back in the early 70's and it still makes me laugh out loud. The extras contained in this special addition give it a nice touch.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Really good content and the image are clear.  Really like this blu ray a lot. The special features are good as well
B004P12SSW|1.0|Predictable plot, awful acting, juvenile story line.  Christina's voice saves the day and is the only thing to be wowed by in this movie.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I guess I expected more out of this book given the great ratings and the hype surrounding the movie (which I haven't seen yet). It's a bit slow. I had to get about 40% through before it became a book I couldn't put down.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|First and foremost, this is an incredibly fun game.  At it's most basic, it's a physics game where you builds structures (large and small) to get your goo's to the drain pipes.  You seek to take best advantage of the goo's abilities while keeping as many of them alive/together as possible.<br /><br />Sounds easy, but it's not.<br /><br />There are varying levels of mastery for this game.  You can complete the levels or you can show your true obsessive compulsive disorder and get ALL the goo's to safety.  You can replay levels to try and reach perfection or march boldly toward the end game...or (as I did) play a little of both.<br /><br />The graphics are fun and vibrant, the animation smooth and often humorous, and the music/soundtrack is outstanding.  I even loved the oft-repeated goo sounds.  I'll admit, they made me laugh over and over again.  The game physics are easy to learn, but challenging to master.  Each level asks more of you - in skill, forethought, and execution.  The challenges increase steadily and fairly (there was no rapid learning curve or difficulty that makes you want to stop playing).<br /><br />Bottom line, this game is fun - fun - fun!  I've played a lot of android games on different devices (3 different android phones over last 3 years, asus transformer, kindle fire hd).  This is one of the best I've played. I hope to see more from this developer for android as they obviously \\"get\\" how to make tablet games fun and challenging.  GREAT GAME!<br /><br />[Played on Kindle Fire HD]
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I like the exploration that is in the game and the storyline is pretty good, I would say give it a try if you like mini game
030758836X|2.0|Great Writing, uniquely interesting characters with deep phycological inputs, yet ended with a big Excuse me?  Is this the ending? After reading 400 pages, I am still wondering so, where is justice?  Don't we expect a better righteous problem solving in a bigger picture than solving just one couple's need?
1449433251|5.0|Other than it taking a really long time to arrive, it was in great shape when I got it. No scratches, tears, or anything like that.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I loved this book. You should really try it.  Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
B007IXWKUK|3.0|No substance to Book Two.  It was like reading Book One over again.  Fairy tale material.  May appeal to some.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I hardly feel qualified to critique Les Mis so I will tell you that I got it to expand my e-library.  I am in the middle of another book, so it is next in the queue to read.  The Kindle tops my list as one of my all time favorite gifts and buying books from Amazon is so easy.  Thanks.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the two previous books, I was finally glad to be finished with this series of books.  Fifty Shades of Freed was the better read of the three but that's not saying much.  Too much hype for repetitive material.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Great game for those who love this genre.<br />The story is interesting and the characters even more. The gameplay is simple and fun.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was okay if you like reading the same scenerios over and over.  Basicly no premis in this series other than sex.  If you like that, you will love the series.  I like a little more storyline to my reading.  May appeal to women who believe in fairy tales.
1401907717|5.0|It was an excellent buy!<br />It arrived in a perfect and new condition, and on time which made in an over all excellent product.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|This product does not work at all, the app never found my location, thus it never worked or gave me any directions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book, along with the entire series is absolutely amazing!!!! It made me laugh, cry, and yell in angry. The way only the best books can!!!
B004UJCYYW|5.0|I really liked this book, it is full of french culture and grammar.<br />It is perfect for french learners.<br />Great
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a really good book. Would definitely rate this book 5 stars. If u like this book read I funny. It's another middle school at
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book really really turned the whole series around truely loved it. The twists and turns of this book kept me guessing till the end
B0086700CM|1.0|All you do is run and die like an idiot. I should've never got this game it's sucks a lot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen the movie but everyone who had read the book first told me to read it anyways. I am so glad that I did because it is incredible! There are parts in the movie that they change from the book, so reading the original story is way better.
0316286869|5.0|I bought this book for a girl who loves makeup and spends much time playing with it. At 8 years old, she did a makeover on me that showed me just how much skill she already has. While an older book, it isn't dated by the styles of the '80s. There is so much about just how to use makeup to emphasize or draw attention to or away from different features that it feels classic. This book is about style, not fashion. it's also a large format with huge photos and many illustrations.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|So far, so good. Love that the characters are changing and growing, and also that Stuart has somewhat been added to the group. I can't wait to see where it goes from here.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|The videos are so well researched and produced that the age of the production does not matter much. The changes of the past 50 or so years aren't shown here but for the most part, that doesn't change the value of what is presented. The videos draw connections from past to the then present in interesting ways. Anyone interested in science or culture or the path of human accomplishment would find these videos fascinating.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wonderful story of over coming the past and allowing yourself to trust again. Another great love story by Nicholas Sparks.
0765325950|4.0|The forces of the Light and the Darkness prepare for the final battle, which appears will occur north of the Mountains of Dhoom in Shayol Ghul.  Meanwhile hostilities flare up elsewhere as Talmanes leads a depleted Band of the Red Hand in a fight against the Trollocs in Caemlyn; Elayne had taken much of their force especially the cavalry to the Field of Merrilor where the rulers will decide whether to support Rand al'Thor's dangerous plan to free the Dark One or kill him before his insanity demoralizes the humans.  Regardless of who stands victorious in the Last Battle, The Wheel of Time is moving to end this age.<br /><br />This is an exciting finish to the two decade old Wheel of Time saga as Brandon Sanderson provides an action-packed final battle (and several precursor combats) in his third effort (see The Gathering Storm and Towers of Midnight).  The battle scenes are top rate while making up the brunt of the 900 plus page tome, but also have a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu sense after several war scenes occur.  Not surprisingly, some of the numerous long-running subplots receive short shrift as do key characters and races.  Still, this is a well-done climax as several fronts explode while the adversarial forces prepare and meet for the final battle that will determine the fate of humanity as the Wheel of Time turns.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B00913DPW2|5.0|At first I tried the Tesla one (different co.) and was unimpressed with it's lack of areas to explore. This app is incredible and very challenging. Worth the price, but I see they dropped it since I bought it. This game has so many rooms, tunnels, etc. All brilliant. There are \\"demons\\" which are pretty creepy. If you're looking for a game which lasts for days on end, then this is the one for you. I bought the Haunt2 as well. I can't wait to see the #3!!
B002PEP4U0|4.0|I'm glad this was a book club selection, or I might never have read it.  William lets his readers feel the beauty in much of his traditional Malawian life, and also brings to life the suffering his people experience when anything upsets the delicate natural balance in his world.  The extent to which drought and government ineptitude combine to wreak havoc on his world is startling.  I learned a lesson in compassion that will stay with me always.  William's incredible will to teach himself when he was denied the opportunity to attend school, and his mastery of the skills he needed to improve the living standards of his country is amazing and inspirational.  His story is almost like a fairy tale, with a happily-ever-after ending, except that his accomplishments are real and brought about by his own hard work and intellectual curiosity.  I highly recommend his book.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|A favorite at our house! Good price, fun for the whole family, made a great present! Debbie Reynolds and Gene Kelly! Just makes you feel happy!
B000XJ5TOK|4.0|This is a movie that has to be evaluated against expectations.  It is not a cinematic masterpiece, but if you are looking for a good popcorn action flick, you could do worse.  The movie occasionally has some internal contradictions, but you don't want to overthink a movie in this genre.  Sit back, accept the premise, and enjoy the next hour and a half.  The movie improves as Milla Jovovich's role in the story expands.  The HD transfer looks great and the sound is impressive.
B00475BUVM|5.0|Watched this yesterday in 3D blu-ray. Wow! I had seen it previously, but this was a whole new experience! Recommend to anyone who loves 3D, action and adventure.
B0052AC8C6|1.0|Not worth watching. I just wasted five minutes of my life on this before I could stand it no longer. Thankfully it was free or I'd want my money back. Don't bother with this one.
B003L20IHO|5.0|This movie is blu-ray and it has Zac Ephron in it. What more can I say? Oh, and the story is good! A real plus!
0345525558|4.0|The story is a sweet story about a sad past.  The knowledge of the use of symbolism with flowers in earlier days helped to heal the main character two times.  I liked all of the characters.  I accept the improbability of the story as part of the fiction.  Definitely worth reading.  Generally it was a fast light read.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I was introduced to the Playrix games when I bought 'Call of Atlantis '; it was free app of the day.  played that game over &amp; over; absolutely loved it!!!  Decided I wanted another Playrix game; the depth &amp; graphics are unlike any other games!  I looked &amp; found 'Fishdom' for $4.99 hmmm; I rarely spend $.99 on a game but ....went for it.  I am SO addicted to this game!!  The aquariums change as you earn points &amp; you can use you your points to buy fish; decorations &amp; so on.  Well worth $4.99!!!!!
B00006AW63|1.0|I bought this for US use.  It is a British version that does not work in US video players.  There was nothing obvious in the listing to tell me it was for British use.  I think it is a total rip off.  I could not find my receipt either the hard copy or any online version.  I was expecting an online version of my purchase that I could review.  I did not find that in my account information.<br /><br />I am not happy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is no way my review of this book can completely portray the depth of my feelings after having read it. It was amazing. Simply amazing. The tenderness, the emotions, the tough subject matter, Sky and Holder. I love it when a great book carries me away like this and I feel like I'm so invested in the characters and their story line that as much as I can't wait for the ending to see what happens, I'm sad when it ends because I want to see where my new friends go from here. There is no way to describe the love radiating off the pages between these two individuals. My only hope is one day, I meet my own Holder, and he finds within me his own Sky. Read this book. Seriously.
B0086449YA|1.0|I like the music, but the second of two CDs in the set skips and stutters badly and cannot be played
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Ayn Rand so effortlessly captures the human spirit while peeling away the layers of self-deception. A timeless novel that has so many facets that it is hard to explain...written in the 1930s yet as pertinent today as it was then. Surpassed only by Atlas Shrugged...
B004GYY714|4.0|With this service, I'm not sure I need an mp3 player or CD player ever again. Pick what i like and play it from anywhere. No complaints...very pleased.
034580404X|4.0|so far i have read the grey one and was very interested in the strory line then i read darker and liked the whole story i red it in one day now im on the last one and it is hard to follow but i will finish reaing it
B00632HWOG|4.0|I really like this app. Simple, easy to use, format allows me to view easily, delete easily. Nice and easy deletion of multiple emails, etc. Very pleased.
B009AMAK54|5.0|Another great movie by Clint Eastwood.The casting was great.John Goodman is perfect as Director of scouts.Amy adams is wonderful as Eastwoods(gus) daughter.Five stars.Inez
1451695195|5.0|Having gone through a NDE myself I was anxious to hear of someone elses, but even more so because he was a Neurosurgeon.
B001N4RORE|5.0|This is my new feel good movie. I've watched it several times now and I laugh out loud every time. This movie is for anyone who enjoys musicals and/or comedies.
B008YKRRI6|5.0|Twenty years ago i listened to these performance on casette tapes,now they are on cd. Box set is convenient for colletion, better sound and good price.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games and loved it.  I couldn't wait to read the second book Catching Fire.  I wasn't disappointed!  Suzanne Collins does a great job of holding your attention.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This is hands down the best batman movie ever.  It has humor, feeling, hope and destruction.  It lets us know there are some good people
B00632HWOG|5.0|I couldn't get the email program that came with my Kindle Fire HD to work, so I downloaded this app.  Works great!
B001FBIPF0|3.0|This is one of their better cds.  paterick stump is an excellent singer and songwriter.  This is a good listening cd.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love this app.  I have it on my iPhone and added it to my Kindle Fire HD.  Works great!  Highly recommended!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is just one of those books you just can't put down. It is great from beginning to end. The chapters end in a way that make you want to read  on and on and on. Close to impossible to put down.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire HD and it works great.  Very happy with it & will use it.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|It was ok and merging the jason bourne to this one was good however .....the idea behind it to get a virus and them being chased.<br />I didn't get the same intensity as the other bournes. Good but average good.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire HD and am very happy with it.  Work great.  Would recommend it to anyone.
0446585025|5.0|Product works great and arrived fairly quickly. Turnaround time was great from the seller, they shipped the product immediately after ordered. The book was absolutely hilarious, I was laughing throughout the whole thing and read it in less then a day! Only complaint is I wish she wrote more!
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I have used google in the past and still like it. That is enough said and I don't need to add more words.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Do not like this game at all. Just not my type of game. Thought it would have more<br />action to it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can take time out and relieve tension by playing this game. No more words are required to make this review.
B009FXIICK|4.0|This game levels up rather quickly, but it is fun and somewhat addictive!  The whole family enjoys playing this one.
0307887448|5.0|It was absolutely addicting and a perfect read. just buy it read it and you will love it. CANT GIVE 6 stars or i would.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game keeps me entertained. It's a great game. My 2 year old grandson loves it and my husband, who doesn't play games loves it. If it can keep them entertained, it's a great game.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|As usual, the BBC has graced us with a wonderful series.  I can hardly wait to receive Season 3 - I want to see the uncut version, not what's being shown on PBS.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I didn't even know that this product existed until I ordered a MAGLITE flashlight and this item came up as a suggestion that I might like to purchase. Not sorry I did. Now my heavy flashlight hangs securely right where I want it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game with lots to do and a pretty good story/plot. I was bummed when it was over. I NEVER pay for games till this one and it was definitely worth. Only complaint.... wish it was longer!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I can't see myself without it. Phone doesn't always wake me up. It lets you personalize everything which I really like
B00005N6KG|5.0|I don't like ear buds as they never stay in my ears, so I opt for the headband style.  I get about a year's use out of them as I end up getting them tangled and one ear goes out, but I like the quality of the sound for the price.  I always keep a pair in the stash in case I need them
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I recomend this product i like and works fine .I like this product work very good and i recomend other persons. Shipping in time nice exelent. The product came in good conditions
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I was never really into reading books until I asked for suggestions and was suggested this book. I fell in love with instantly and finished  reading it in less than a week. I always wanted to know what every letter would say and how Charlie would change throughout the book. It's just awesome... The characters, their personality and relationship with Charlie kept me interested in the book. Stephen Chbosky is a great author, and I really enjoyed this book.. =)
B003L77GH4|5.0|My daughter was extremely pleased with the DVD set.  The product arrived very quickly and the packing was quite impressive.
B007WFR0QS|3.0|but there was an issue with the song that I expected to be on the CD, and it was not! The song is the last song on the CD, Read all about it, the title is one the cover but its not the song, rather the song right before it, Hope....strange!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I chose this DVD because my friend was a dog lover. It is a sad story, but it was a perfect gift for her.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book centers on the lives of teenagers that are dealing with life threatening and life altering cancers.  I especially enjoyed the way the story was told.  Not from an outsider's point of view but from the sarcastic and overwhelmingly truthful kids themselves.  The characters come to life and you learn to love them and feel pain for them and admire them all at the same time.  They are honest in their recognition of life.  The book is said to have more appeal to a younger crowd but I didn't find it that way. The book is a great fast read with a look into the lives of teenage characters that are not different from your own children just different because of an unfortunate &#34;Fault in their Stars&#34;.
1451695195|5.0|As a registered nurse,  I have heard many similar accounts, both from patients and from family members and friends.  I already believed that these accounts were real,  but this book convinced me even further.  I know that consciousness exists outside the brain.  Even physics has proved that nothing is ever created or destroyed,  that everything that exists  always was and always will be,  although in different forms,  and I believe that includes consciousness as well.  Loved the book.  I have given it to several people,  one of whom is dying.  Thank you,  Dr. Alexander,  for having the courage to write your story.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|You really 'feel for' the characters as they go through their trials.<br />This isn't as bloody-violent as I imagined when I heard what it was about...but does have killings in it.  Not for little children.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I only read it because there was so much hype and I wanted to see for myself.  I read some reviews and folks either loved it or hated it.  Story was average as was the writing. The characters seemed silly and so unrealistic - at least I hope they're unrealistic.  LOL.  Her descriptions were the same repeatedly.  I found myself skipping sections to move it along.  Overall, it was good enough to get me to read the second one.

B00AE2J93I|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie.  It is fun and light hearted, yet full of surprising edge of your seat moments.  Best of all, it has a good anti-bullying message that does not take away from the movie's intended entertainment value.  One note for fellow parents, this is rated age appropriate (PG) and probably not suitable for younger children.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story kept your attention. Full of surprises. Everyone would like a Dean Holder in their life. Shows the meaning of a true friend.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Although the title of this review may sound like a contradiction it is the best description I can muster for such an amazing motion picture.<br /><br />It isn't perfect. But while most people will focus on the flaws I think it is worth focusing on the successes...particularly because they are so brave. The story is as rich and complicated as The Dark Knight. The cinematography is breathtaking, but not in a showy way. It is so stripped down, so grounded, so realistic in its bleakness. The score is beyond masterful; my GOD is the music amazing. And the entire cast delivers fantastic performances.<br /><br />Whatever people have said about Bane is wrong; the voice is AMAZING. He reminds me of a British butler, so prim and proper with his approach to English. And that makes him far more intimidating. Yes, the voice is completely incongruous with his body builder/Mexican wrestler physique...and that's the point. Christian Bale has more to work with in this film and he delivers a fine performance. The supporting cast, from Michael Caine to Morgan Freeman, all bring their A-game to this motion picture (with one exception which will be mentioned later.)<br /><br />The visual effects are typical of this trilogy; they disappear into the background and everything is designed to be as honest and grounded as possible. Christopher Nolan's sensibilities are spot-on in this aspect of his film; by underplaying the spectacle it becomes even more spectacular. Complicated robots and alien planets are so easy to do with CGI and an army of visual effects artists that they remove one from the story. Here, everything feels honest and real. And that makes it that much more stunning.<br /><br />There are some flaws. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) And it almost feels wrong to mention them. Marion Cotillard's death scene is simply awful. It has been much maligned on the internet...deservedly so. There are unnecessary plot twists. There are unnecessary confusing moments. It is unnecessary for the film to begin years after the previous movie. And Christopher Nolan's obsession with almost-trick endings needs to come to an end. That being said...<br /><br />...who cares? The film aspires to such grand heights and achieves so very much that it isn't worth calculating the flaws. In fact, I've chosen to deliberately ignore them. This is a film worth enjoying. It is smart. It is profound. It is magical. And yes, it is masterful.<br /><br />Watch this movie immediately. Turn off your cell phone, silence your home computer, dim the lights and draw the shades. This isn't simply what every superhero aspires to be...this is grand cinema regardless of genre. This is why we love the movies.begin years after the previous movie. And Christopher Nolan's obsession with almost-trick endings needs to come to an end. That being said...<br /><br />...who cares?

B000I9WVY6|5.0|these were some of the bravest men i have ever seen in a war movie.  although they did act like kids sometime, i guess that was one way of relieving stress and all the tension buildup.  that is a great movie, and i have watched it many times.  Thanks John Walker
B004XGN8W4|5.0|The graphics are clear and good colours - works a treat!<br /><br />I would recommend it for anyone who wants to use thier XBox outside their usual environment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  The story really got me towards the end.  I was very surprised and relieved with the ending.  It makes me sad but also warms my heart at the same time.<br />Even though it's more of a teen romance, it has mature content.<br />I will be checking out more of this author's work.
B004KM8ABK|3.0|I know two people who love this mouse.  They purchased it after they developed carpal tunnel syndrome, and could work without pain.  I wish it worked for me, too.  I am 4'11&#34;, and I have tiny hands -- this small mouse isn't small enough for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this story. Hugh Howey was brilliant in his use of words to illustrate an amazingly clear vision...as if I were standing in the story, observing.
B005HI4LLY|4.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a satirical horror/comedy that from start to finish never has any intention of ever taking itself seriously, and in saying, should be viewed that way. In the same vein of `Shaun of the Dead', Tucker & Dale takes all the cliches from the in-bred hillbilly teen slasher flicks switches it up and manages to create a new genre; the accidental slasher film. Tucker and Dale are best buds who just want to drink beer and go fishing down at their dilapidated cabin; sure they're hillbillies but not the `Deliverence' type hillbillies that a bunch of pretentious and extremely prejudice college kids make them out to be. As the story unfolds we witness total misunderstanding through complete idiocy which results in plenty of gruesomely hilarious death scenes. It's easy to see that Tucker & Dale probably wouldn't have worked without the right casting, thankfully Labine and Tudyk work well together and are clearly having a lot of fun. Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a good gory fun redneck slasher horror with no fear of man rape just good clean hilarity; check it out.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Woodchippers should be approached with extreme caution!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />A rough cut of the film was leaked revealing various moments when lines are dubbed and when post-production effects are used.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I LOVE this product.  It's a perfect solution for me and my daughter. My pantry had no wiring for a light and the Hipe 8 LED was simple to install, works every time with just the movement of door opening, gives enough light to see all the shelves in my small pantry, and (since the door is louvered), I can tell the light then goes off just a few seconds after the door is closed.  My daughter lives in a small rental house with an outside door opening into a dark hallway before the 2nd entry door into her house.  She has lights on both doors, so with the moment the first door swinging open, both door lights are on and stay on until she's safely inside.  It may not be enough light for some, but in these small-space situations, it's works perfectly and we're both thrilled with the results.
B004LWZW2E|3.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />From the writer and director of Saw, comes another horror film, this time in the form of a ghostly thriller. The film starts out quite slow and drawn out, but one feels it is all by design as by the time the inhabited demons drop by for a scare, you will be well and truly clutching your cushion in terror. Unfortunately, this is the film's blessing and curse, in that after a while you begin to get acclimatised to the constant `jump' moments, Director James Wan throws at you. So, by the time the film reaches it climatic end and we finally get to see the demon that lurks, it is neither scary, nor memorable. The actors do fine jobs and the dark lighting and cinematography fleshes out a creepy atmosphere. That being said, for a night of screams on a Saturday night be sure to rent it out...but it's unlikely you'll ever watch it again.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Scares galore, you will have to wait a while till you get them, but turn off the lights and enjoy!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film was made for $1.5 million and grossed $97 million at the box office.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love ti's game I would give it a a q 7 out of five stars I thisnk you should try it.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|Is it any good?<br /><br />If you have seen a Wes Anderson film, you will know what to expect. The wide angles, the centre framing, the Bill Murray's. They are all here. It's a love story about some runaway kids; sure, maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but you cannot help but be swept up by the nostalgia of 60's. Simpler times, where kids were either playing outside or listening to the radio. Anderson again pulls together an all star cast, including Murray of course, but also featuring the likes of Bruce Willis, and Edward Norton as the Scout Master desperately searching for his member before a violent storm engulfs the island. This cute and quirky film will defiantly appease Wes Anderson fans, but may also be appreciated but those who have yet to experience his genius.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Sam and Suzy set up camp on the Cove, kind of like lord of the flies, but with less murders and more romance.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film currently has a 98% positive review rating by the top critics on Rotten Tomatoes.
0307744434|5.0|An extremely fascinating book full of mystery, intrigue, romance. Beautifully written, and a joy to read. I couldn't put it down.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best from the &#34;best&#34; horror writer of our times.  In usual Stephen King fashion, the story takes place in Maine and wraps around to another novel from the past. (&#34;IT&#34;)  Great read, I can't put it down.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|I love the movie Brave. So much that I decided to purchase the DVD in December. However, attempting to stream through Amazon Instant Video and a Roku player produced Audio and Video that were out of synch. Worse, I contacted Amazon the day we purchased the stream (in November) and it has taken the \\"support team\\" TWO MONTHS to attempt to \\"fix\\" the issue. I have received three form emails telling me that the technical support team is still working on this issue. I guarantee that a company like Amazon should not be struggling to fix a technical synch issue. So far, there has been no refund of my $5 to purchase the jobby stream or any attempt to give a coupon or discount for a future stream. I'm an Amazon Prime member, since the start of the program, and LOVE Amazon. BUT... I will not purchase an Instant Streaming Video ever again.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This was to replace a Swiss Knife product which he carried for about 10 years. It suddenly fell apart he was thrilled this one has<br />more devices and overall is better made. I would recommend it to anyone. My son is very picky !
B00932HEX2|5.0|Love this show but my only problem is that it has alot of language and alot of nude content, but other than that this show is amazing ! Keep you at the edge of your seat the whole time.
B008Y6TXDC|5.0|I was skeptical. I've been a Beatles fan all my life and had big concerns that this would be super-cheese stupid. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The movie and the music are amazing. Even if you're just looking for background noise, the music is so good. The segment with Dear Prudence is my favorite, but every song is done well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a different book. Some may find it hard to follow. It is very artistic. Still very much worth the time to read.

B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan and Charlott's &#34;Together&#34;  is not at all my usual music, to say the least.  Absolutely wonderful, especially the first couple songs.  Beautiful.  It is relaxing and exhilarating at the same time.  Elicits emotional response.  A real musical treat.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I give it 5 stars. The game is a normal solitaire game. Fun as usual. Works great on the kindle fire.
B001BSBBEE|1.0|First off, I love \\"Carnival of Souls.\\" Although it's riddled with mistakes, I still find it to be a very creepy movie.<br /><br />So why did I get this one--complete with irreverent commentary?  Mainly out of curiosity--I wanted to see the colorized version. A very bad idea. The film's gloominess and sense of disconnectedness disappears with the splashy colors. Listening to Mike Nelson's running commentary was even worse, and not because I \\"worship\\" the original. His jokes just fell flat, likely because he did the job solo -- no 'bots on this one. The interplay among the characters on MST3K made the humor much more successful.<br /><br />Live and learn, I guess. I'll stick with my Criterion edition.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book I  Good for ages eight and up .<br />It is funny and the best Diary of a wimpy kid yet.<br />THANKS A LOT JEFF KINNEY!!!<br />I love your books

B00005N6KG|5.0|I have found them to be every bit as light and easy to use as I expected.  One of the family had a set and I thought they looked good.  They do need the cord to be maybe one of two feet longer for my current use.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nice calm game to play for everyone.  The different levels are a wonderful option.  It is a great time filler.
B001GQSY64|2.0|If you are about to buy this, DON'T!<br /><br />This film is absolute crap.<br /><br />The story is crap, the acting is crap, the animation is crap, everything is crap.<br /><br />If you want to introduce your young children to Star Wars, this is not the way to do it.  Show them A New Hope instead.  This garbage is not worth your time of day.  Please do not buy this.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Urban couple marry, she's cool, he's good looking and has a good job. Her cool was contrived and she drops it while his job is lost and they move to Missouri. They both become increasingly critical of the other but differently. Here's the part that's good. The chapters alternate from her point of view to his but you have to notice the chapter date. They rarely note the same thing at the same time. As the chapters unfold these people change before our eyes, he fairly predictably, she not at all.<br />Her behavior will grab you about the time you thought you might stop reading. The pace accelerates into newer and newer terratory.<br />One caveat; you may not want to read this if you are having marital trouble and deffinitely do not allow your spouse to read if you are.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Full of suspense and action, the story line was not what I expected from the title. I genuinely grew to like the main character, even as her captor did.

B004TI5N38|3.0|Good story but, too much like the Jack Teacher books by Lee Child.  A good story that keeps you on edge.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I like Susan Boyle's singing.  She is still a typical small town person with no false personality.  She is just real.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Spectacular to look at a great story and Peter O'Toole the perfect choice to play T.E Lawrence. David Lean is obviously the benchmark for many directors and one thing that strikes me is the judicial use of music, sound effects and silence. So many directors now think that it's necessary to have sound effects for every action on screen or mood music for every emotion mainly I think to cover up the paucity of their scripts and story! So watching this movie is very enjoyable. Highly recommended.

B003VANOFY|3.0|I've had these headphones for almost 2 years now, and I'm now having to replace them. The usb power cord has stopped powering my headphones unless the cord is pulled at a ridiculous angle, and the power seems to be drained very quickly, making them essentially corded headphones with all the drawbacks of a wireless receiver.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Wireless! Make a run to the kitchen without missing a thing or having to pause your music.<br />- Very comfortable. I have a very large head and these were snug but fit my ears well and could be worn for hours at a time.<br />- Very satisfied with the audio and microphone quality. I'm no audiophile but it was satisfactory for me.<br />- Being able to adjust the actual computer volume from the headset was a huge plus. Customizable buttons also allowed me to walk around the house and still chime in on voice chat.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Huge pain to turn on and off. The power button is recessed into the headset, has very little movement, and you have to hold it down for a seemingly random amount of time in order to get it to make a connection. Turning them off was even worse. This is compounded by the fact that the headset will turn itself off automatically if it doesn't receive any audio for a time. I felt like I've spent far too much time over these two years fiddling with the power button. Why not just use a switch?!<br />- Power cord is frustrating to connect. The headphones use a usb-micro-b connection to connect to power. There are many connectors that would have been a much better choice than this. There is 0 chance of plugging in the cord to the headphones without taking them off. I find this annoying since you are also expected to charge the headphones is when the computer is turned on. Eventually I just hooked up the headphones to their own usb charger plugged into the wall, but what a pain.<br />- Sometimes the connection will just cut out and the headphones will attempt to reconnect for the next 5 seconds. This would happen if there was too much interference (like standing in front of the microwave, very understandable), but it would also happen if the power to the headphones was disconnected or reconnected. When my power cord connection began to fail, this would happen all the time, usually in the middle of a game where I can't stop to inspect the state of the cord.<br />- Sometimes the headphones would get into a state where the volume knob and buttons just didn't work. Not sure why. Turning the headphones off and on again would fix this, but annoying to deal with.<br />- Sometimes when the headphones were in stereo mode and the application thought I was in 7.1 mode, I would only get audio in my right ear. Switching to 7.1 would fix this, but I don't understand why that would be happening in the first place<br />- Minor gripe: The headphones are a bit heavy (understandably because of batteries) which meant that if you looked down they would easily slide off your head. This made doing tasks around the house difficult, kind of defeating the purpose.<br /><br />I'm giving these headphones 3 stars instead of 2 because I got a year and a half of good service out of them. However, I wouldn't recommend these to a friend since the price tag is steep for a product that isn't as polished and stable as it should be. The only other headphones I've spent over $100 on were Audio Technica ATH-A500s which I bought about a decade ago, and I'm wearing them as I write this now. Headphones, especially pricey ones should be expected to last more than 1.5 years. In all, the benefit of wireless listening wasn't worth the aggravation it caused me. I'm going back to corded headphones for now.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|my first Reacher book and already a fan. looking forward to reading the whole series. I especially like the practice of adding the begining of the next book at the end and with the Kindle its only a few clicks and I'm already on the next book. Great!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great book!!! Not quite as good as the first one but still great. Can't wait for the next one in the series!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was beautiful and heartbreaking. You should seriously read this, and probably not in public. Bring out the tissues!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Always good when written by Michael Connelly and Harry is in it!!  Not quite finished with it but very near the end.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|I would rate it a 4.75 ONLY because it doesn't have a part II.  I love this kind of hidden object game, versus some of the others that have a  circle with belonging items.  I liked the interactive side of it too, find objects here, solve clues, and use items in another scene.  My favorite so far!
B00APUYN0I|1.0|I DID NOT GET TO WATCH THIS BECAUSE THE HD VERSION WOULD NOT DOWNLOAD AND THERE WAS NO PROVISION BY AMAZON FOR ME TO UNDO MY PURCHASE AND RE-BUY THE SD VERSION.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, but ended up being impressed with the movie.  Wish I'd seen it in 3D when it was in the theatre.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I got this for my daughter's Christmas gift since it is one of her favorite books & the whole family loves watching the movie. It has such a great message.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Does what it said it would. Easy to install and use. Very clear reception. Holds charge for long period of time.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great graphics and the game is very easy to use for all ages. Would like it even mire if the coins added up faster to upgrade the zoo.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Superb acting with a real-looking cast of seasoned faces and how they cope with change in their lives. Most recommended.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE, BUT GOOD ACTION SCENES. WOULD OF LIKED TO HAVE SEEN BRUCE WILLIS HAVE A BIGGER PART, HE WAS THE BEST ACTOR.
B00819ER0Q|5.0|An entertaining, humorous yet thought-provoking film, it makes you think about our TV-media driven culture. I watched it with my 19 year old daughter and 14 year old son; we all enjoyed it. Great family entertainment.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|TOO MANY F WORDS AND JUST PLAIN STUPID, MARK WAHBERG IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS MOVIE. WOIULD NEVER RECCOMMEND THIS MOVIE
B008M87GJK|4.0|It's good to get a different take on world events.  Sometimes I realize after watching news four an hour that I didn't learn anything about what's going on I the world.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE IT SHOWS THAT HUMAN BEINGS HAVE A HEART AND WHAT IT CAN DO IF YOU PUT YOUR HEART AND SOLE INTO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN

0345803493|4.0|This is a good book but I do not reccommend it for young readers under 18 years of age there is alot of adult content
B0086700CM|4.0|been playing almost a week. a lot of fun. very fast paced and challenging not to mention addictive. it's awesome.  The graphics are very good. Once I start I find it hard to stop as I constantly want to beat my last run. Great fun'
030758836X|4.0|Book arrived quickly and in immaculate condition, very enjoyable read. It was very hyped up, so it was doomed to fall short of my super high expectations but still found it to be a worthwhile and fun read.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|While this is a very insightful novel there were times I was left feeling a little left out, seemed as if some information was not well presented.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|This is a nice read and certainly worth a few evenings of my time.  However, I don't think the book is a as accomplished as \\"Shiver.\\"  The negative parental involvement from Grace 's previously uninvolved parents doesn't seem likely to me.  Especially since Sam's character is  emotional, gentle, and obviously lacking in deception, I find it hard to believe their unwarranted hostility, especially early in the book when the two have clearly done no wrong. I personally liked the introduction of Cole and Isabel as narrators.  The book really would have been lacking without them, as the played out story of lovers separated would have been really boring to me without some characters who were still growing and making progress.  The ending was very disappointing to me since Cole's logic in determining Graces treatment is based on some information that contradicts what we learned in \\"Shiver\\" about when Grace was bitten. The timeline just doesn't work.  However, I am hoping the author clears it all up in the last part of this trilogy, which I still intend to read.
B007A4SDCG|3.0|I'm not sure I agree with all this guy said, nor that I particularly like the way he said it, but I definitely got something out of it.  I was looking for a little bit of inspiration and direction and I got that.  If you are wanting a wee pep talk and some encouragement this is the book for you.  It has some well known but clearly reiterated tips to moving toward yourself.  It did have a bit of the ol' god god stuff in it which is not for me so, depending on own persuasion, that will either be a positive or a negative!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I could barely put it down. The way this book went every direction kept me wanting more. This book I would definitely recommend to all my lady friends. This book definitely deserve 5 stars.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|You know, sometimes you read a book and from the first sentence you just know it's brilliant.  The characters are interesting and unusual which is always a drawcard for me.  I like intelligent unusual characters who are dealing with difficult situations and this novel delivers.  It's a quick and easy read and you never have that dragging feeling of having to get through the next paragraph just to get to the story.  In fact I enjoyed it so much that I looked up the author to see what else they'd done!  Find him on youtube - he's funny!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Once you get past the idea of destroying life on earth it is a really fun game. You will never have more fun ending all life.
B00ANGSSWS|5.0|I am a big fan of the previous albums from BVB, so I was quick to get this one. The album is great, though I miss some of the screams/growls from We Stitch These Wounds.  Still, it's a great album.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|Like the fit of the Kindle in it. Easy to access for use and also recharging. I would recommend it.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|my 2 and 5 year old loved this movies, but it was a little scary at parts for them.  funny enough that my husband and i could watch it with them and enjoy it too.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very exciting game, love playing mahjong, and it really makes the time go by fast when you are waiting in the doctor's office!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Best friend Favorite movie, wanted to buy something I know she would love, now she can watch it anytime she wants
0756666937|5.0|My son loved this book! I love that i could find a book about something he loves so much! Nicely priced & arrived for his birthday just when it was scheduled.
0765325950|5.0|As a standalone novel, this would fail. The pacing can be strange, and AMoL has to cover so much ground that it can't conform to a traditional story arc. However, as the conclusion to a gargantuan fantasy series, this book is stunningly successful. It proves to be more satisfying than I thought possible. It's quite long, and it's not perfect. But it's exactly what it needed to be.
0761169431|5.0|My son and his best friend are having a blast with these! since they had not done this before they had a bit of trouble getting started, but the instructions were great & worded well for 10 yr olds! And it arrived for christmas just when it was scheduled.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Interesting cast of characters and how their lives are interwoven between the classes. It is amazing the way relationships change with the onset of WWI. I really feel attached to the characters and I'm glad I can review this season 2 before I begin to watch season 3.
B001JIFYSA|1.0|Worst movie I have ever seen. I can't believe this great cast played in this movie.  A bunch of shallow relationship and unrealistic characters.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game and would definitely recomend to my friends. The game moves so fast you have to be on your toes so you do not miss out on your next move.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It seems to do the job pretty well. I've never had any problems with the app. I just wish that the Kindle would charge while in use.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really like the music of the Piano Guys and this is a nice collection of creative arrangements of contemporary music mixed with some classical.
B004XZ99LO|2.0|I was NOT impressed with the 3D in most areas largely because they had the camera zoomed out so far that even on a good size home TV (55in) the images are small and unimpressive.  While many good 3D movies might have long shots in 3D, normally they will mix it up and often zoom in to close up shots.  I can see why this might be a good movie for effects on IMAX screens, but it is one of the least impressive I have bought for a home TV.  Without the visual images to engage you, the movie does become pretty boring.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Awesome movie.  We continue to watch this movie over and over again.  Good family movie!  Also bought<br />Cre-O Battleship - kind of like Legos, but replica of this ship.  Building it now.
B00A8Z6KN8|3.0|I enjoyed the music from the LOTR trilogy better. The main theme is &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; and &#34;Over the Hill&#34; and the extra &#34;Song of the Lonely Mountains&#34; best reflect this.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Always a wonderful movie. Have watched this multiple times and probably should just buy it  and add it to my library.
0767903374|5.0|Goes hand in hand with the instructional book.<br />Very useful.<br />Highly advised you get with original book.<br />Haven't gone all thru it but so far so good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really wasn't sure where this book was going in the beginning; however, it captured my attention. Having gone through a family situation similar to what is related in this book, it was enlightening to read from the victims perspective. Although parents of children who are abused, whether it be by another parent, boyfriend, girlfriend, or relative, everyone is a victim.<br /><br />I particularly liked the phrase where she said \\"there's nothing like the guilt you feel when there's room in your heart to love evil\\"<br /><br />I have felt that guilt.<br /><br />Thank you to the author for sharing this story from this perspective.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a great game. It's fun to play. It's a lot like Dragon city on facebook.  Give it a try and you'll like it.
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|Ben Affleck is one of the worst directors in Hollywood today. Go see anything he makes, and it's guaranteed to be derivative and cliched. The Town is a heist movie. There is absolutely nothing original about it. Affleck ripped off scores of movies to come up with the characters and plot of that film.  Even if you can't remember the names of the films, you can remember the familiar plot elements, even the mood. It's the same with Argo. It's basically your typical \\"crash land\\" movie. A group of people end up in a hostile land populated by ignorant savages and have to figure out how to escape. The ignorant savages in this film are the Iranians, whom Affleck refuses to give any sort of proper motivations for their actions, history or backstory. He leaves it for self-righteous American audiences to determine these people are subhuman and hate progress. Which is absolutely wrong and indicative of a propaganda film.<br /><br />It is hard to connect to any of the film's characters and by the end, the film loses all credibility with the chase scene on the airport tarmac that never actually happened. You see, these Iranian savages apparently have a modern airport, but can't figure out how to call the tower and tell a plane to stop. It's hard to believe this film ever got nominated and awarded for many awards. While I have made it apparent that I thought the film was propaganda, it certainly didn't help matters when the First Lady just happened to show up to announce the Best Picture award. Seriously, when does that EVER happen?<br /><br />Propaganda movies, even for causes I support, are generally an insult to my intelligence. That is exactly what Argo was. Even if I ignored that, the movie was very mediocre. Better movies with this same plot have been ignored or even deemed terrible? Why does this one get so much attention, especially when the story is altered and fictionalized for jingoistic and entertainment reasons? This is yet another blunder by the Academy, which is continuing to ruin its credibility by giving suspect winners Oscars for mediocre or terrible performances. It's not surprising that ratings have been declining.
0199537623|4.0|I found Vanity Fair almost impossible to rate and am ending up giving it four stars. In many ways this is a thoroughly modern work. The voice is consistently sarcastic, indeed consistently funny. The ending is spectacular: witty, daring, not at all what I (confidently) expected. At the same time I am convinced this cannot, should not be read like a modern novel.<br /><br />The plot follows two young ladies, one rich and one poor, at least to begin with, one virtuous and the other opportunistic, in their trajectories through late-Georgian society. From husbands to family members to more distant hangers-on, one is regaled besides with the careers of a far wider cast of characters. A social satire at heart, moreover, Thackeray's masterpiece does not shrink from psychological detail nor from moral inquiry. At the same time, for all the fascinating banter, this remains an ever-disconcerting book. The modern novel is plot-driven. Even in a work like, say, Franzen's Freedom or Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty, where the point is in social portrayal, all the elements end up moving to one end, driving the reader forward in unison. I would argue the contemporary equivalent of Vanity Fair is the (high-quality) TV serial. This was published in instalments. It was, and is in this edition, illustrated. And it takes the time to explore an infinity of side plots and twists and to keep painting its characters until the very last page. This is to be read in instalments, to be savoured, perhaps alongside other readings, at pace. Finding myself incapably of doing that, I now fail to give it five stars. And if this is unfair, so is the denouement of Vanity Fair.
1594135851|5.0|*** happy with the book<br />thanks<br />review<br />done<br />good book - i like it -  review requires more words than necessary
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock Is awesome! It is a great show done well! The cast is great and I can sit and watch it over and over!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Listened to it over and over - it was amazing!  I especially loved that they brought back the original cast.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Yes, I am of the age where I need reading glasses most of the time but the font on this calculator is enormous and wonderful and renders me reading glasses free. I use this instead of my iPhone app because it's so readable. Love it!
B001B9BEF4|5.0|Big fan of old school metal and rock and roll. And by that, I do not mean John Mellancamp or Yess. What I do mean is this...if you're anything like me and have a wide variety of tunage on your play list, Johnny Cash, Suicidal Tendacies, Amy Winehouse, Megadeth, 3 Days Grace and back again to Slash or The Cars...then this album has a lot of great tracks that correctly fill the gap. Not too mellow to too hard too fast and bass ackwards. If you get my drift.
1609611543|5.0|This is good for those of us who have trouble digesting breads and any other wheat products. At the end of December 2012, I stopped eating any wheat-based foods.  I feel better than I have in years, but yes, I miss cakes and cookies and pasta, but I haven't tried any of the &#34;gluten-free&#34; products on the market yet either. Also, I haven't weighed myself since I started this but my clothes are getting looser.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The Gril with the Dragon Tattoo Enjoyed the book but it had a couple of slow spots I will read the other books soon
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Order this book for my Grandchidren. They loved the book and this added to their experience. The children are ages 2 and 4. They did find the roller coaster train ride across the ice scary.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love all of Vince Flynn's work. Mitch Rapp and Hurley made for an excellent combination in American Assassin.  Looking forward yo more books.
0393327345|5.0|Haven't gotten tio read yet, but the book was in great shape.  Loved the movie and heard (as it always is) that this book was better.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I had no idea what the black box was.  The story was well written and kept me interested to the end.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|I enjoyed all the movies in the series but the first one, The Matrix, is still my favorite. The characters are all new, lots of action, good effects and a great storyline. I seem to get a little more out of it every time I watch it. I watch it 3 to 4 times per year.
B002R88G5E|5.0|This is one of the best written books I have ever read. Difficult to put it down, it is so engaging - you just keep on turning to the next page. As a woman I cannot afford but to cry for Marriams and Lailas of our wicked world
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Addressing previous comments: I've noticed that there are a ton of people putting the book down as being \\"written by a teenager\\" and how adolescent the character sounds in the book.  The character isn't some 50 year old experienced woman.  She's a 21 year old socially, romantically, and sexually inexperienced woman.  The book is about her sexual awakening.  She's basically going from a teen's way of thinking into the mindset of a woman in a very short period of time.  I'm guessing that some of us have forgotten what the first time having a crush on a man/woman was like or what our first sexual experience was like.  Some have compared it to Twilight.  I can see the resemblance. I don't care about how many times she said \\"oh my\\" or \\"flushed crimson\\".  And for those who are upset about him being a young billionaire, there are lots of young billionaires alive today some self-made, some inherited.  Some self made young billionaires include: Xiaofeng Peng, John Arnold, Kostyantin Zhevago, and Larry Page(Co-founder of Google).  But there are many more.  It isn't so far fetched to think that someone who is a self-made billionaire but once knew what it was like to be normal or impoverished could fall in love with an educated beauty with no social status.  I do believe that 28 year old self-made billionaire and co-founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg just got married this past year to a Harvard educated doctor. They met 9 years ago, when they were both nobodies.  From the number of people who are commenting on the fact that almost every page has an orgasm, I'm guessing some of you are VERY dissatisified with your sex lives, lol.  I know from personal experience, that there are some men who are able to achieve what he does to Ana every single time.  Christian has had nothing but time on his hands to perfect his game.<br /><br />Personally, I love the book.  The author did a very good job of letting us know exactly how Ana felt at all times.  It may not be for everyone, but ifyou still have a romantically sexual mind like I do, you'll probably love it too.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good, think the best of the three books in the Trilogy.  Read it in just a few days, as couldn't<br />put it down.  If you liked the first book of the 3 you will really like this one.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|this is by far the greatest trilogy of all time.<br />3 great movies for one low prices? can't go wrong
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down when I started reading it.  Wished author had<br />written another. Hated to see it come to an end.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Very intertaining.  No shortage of voilence and sex...but also has enough of a plot and compelling characters to go along with it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed by this work. The characters feel so organic, even with the story being told in first person. You can really feel the issues that he is suffering through and even if it feels like it is sometimes written by a young teen or even a child it is appropriate because of the mental illness issue. I was very pleased with the story as a whole. Well done.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Continued enjoyment of a great series.  I have also given this as a gift and it was the hit of the evening.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really Kate Morton's books. I started with The forgotten Garden, the House at Riverton, and now this one. She keeps you guessing ,just waiting for the next page.
0440241901|5.0|I have read I've Got Your Number and Remember Me by Sophie Kinsella and loved them both, so I knew this book was going to be good as well.  Once I started reading it I did not want to put it down.  This is truly a romantic book, a funny book.  The descriptions and personalities of all the characters were great. The story was great. Just all great. I highly recommend this book and the others I mentioned.  There was something going on all the time. Just a rollercoaster ride full of happiness, sadness, funniness and romance.  A make you feel good inside book.

B008F9T76Q|5.0|I was not a reader at all until i watch the move The Hunger Games. After seeing it, it left me wanting more. So i picked up the audio books to all 3 of the Hunger game books. And wow, why wasn't i reading before. So after finishing THG series i was in search for more  books to read in the same genre. I discovered. The Maze Runner Series. It took a little bit for the plot to build, one it did. I couldn't put the books down. ( reference to audiobook). I wanted to know what was going to happen next. If you decide to pick up The Maze Runner books, don't stop after the first one. READ THEM ALL!!!!!!. Then pick up the prequel to them called \\" The Kill Order\\". After listening to The Hungers Games & The Maze Runner trilogy's it has really opened my eyes to reading(listening books).<br /><br />If anyone has other audiobooks to offer, please let me know!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|HAHAHA I love this app ! I always wanted to play Piano, now I can, well sort of. Its also nice just to listen to the songs.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Just ok , the older movies where better done,the bad guy was a little too &#34;Kornie&#34; movie was too long for what it was.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Based in the book of Robert A Heinlein many see it as a satire of a militaristic state at war.  I saw it as a good adaptation of an excellent book.  The satire not as satire at all.  Propaganda you know is propaganda is its own satire.  The militaristic future of Robert A wasn't one at all.  In his army EVERYBODY fought.  In his democracy you appreciated democracy because you had to pay a price.  In his war you fought for a cause that mattered.<br /><br />There is more military tyranny in Halo than in the world of Starship Troops.<br /><br />And again, propaganda is its own satire.  You cannot do it without being faintly ridiculous.<br /><br />I always thought that Heinlein's world would work.  Today's US is bankrupt paying for mercenaries and bases in 150 nations.  Heinlein's was peaceful.<br /><br />Until the bugs came.

0316228532|1.0|This is my first review on a book, but I felt I had to let people know that they shouldn't let their kids read this book!  It is meant for adults only, and even adults will find it too much of a bad thing.  Very depressing, lots of foul language, sex, smoking, drugs, truancy, lying, stealing; pretty much all the things you'd never want your kids to do.  There's not one part of this storyline that turns out good in the end.  I'm so saddened that she would choose to include all of these things knowing her biggest followers are KIDS!!  Very poor judgment.

Not to mention, the widgets are awesome! They make my home screen look great and never have random updates like the built in weather on my samsung note
030758836X|1.0|What the hell is wrong with this author? She clearly has issues, deeply rooted issues. I'm not sure how else a healthy, normal individual could write such a trite, awful, sadistic novel. What's even more appalling is that the book has so many great reviews! What's wrong with people?<br />The plot line is boring and slow. The characters are not only unbelievable, but deeply, deeply awful and unlikeable. I was hoping they would die a horrible death by the end of the novel. Speaking of the end- that wasn't an end. It left you hollow, pissed off and just angry that you spent two hours reading this garbage.<br />The author included the minutiae in every page, she never bothered to give a different voice to the two characters- they're both narrated from a single point of view, which is the author's....which is why, I suppose, she had to head each chapter with the name of the protagonist she was talking about. Otherwise, we'd be confused as to which character she's writing about, since they both sound the same.<br />I too was pressured into reading this, simply because of all the reviews and the fact that \\"the ending leaves you speechless\\"....it does, but not in a good way-instead, in a \\"I want to gargle my mouth with bleach\\" way, and then drive to wherever this author lives and smack her across the head with this damn book.<br />Awful. Totally awful, undeserving of its praise. Never, ever, in my life have I read a book with more unlikeable characters. I hope she stops writing altogether. Do the world a favor!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book kept me guessing what would happen next. Loved it! I was hooked from start to finish. There were so many twists!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series has been an exciting read!  Every moment of my free time has been spent reading. I forfeited many hours of sleep to discover what would happen to the people of silo 17! I can't wait for the next series to come out. A superb read. Highly recommended! Thanks Hugh!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|What can I say?<br />Adam is wonderful.<br />I love everything he records.<br />He is so HANDSOME.<br />I will continue buying all he does.<br />He will be  Greater is the coming years.<br />Don't under estimate him.
B007G51UV0|5.0|My first motherboard arrived well packaged and on time, and I was very excited.  Everything installed without a hitch,and I had my system up and running in no time at all.  However, the particular motherboard I received started telling me that my RAM was bad after a reboot, and after all the troubleshooting I can do with my current equipment and some new RAM to confirm it was the slot, I had to send it back.  Amazon was great about the return, and I had a new one in minimal downtime.  The board itself is jam-packed with features, and I can't see anyone but the most high level enthusiasts needing anything more than what this board offers.  The built in Wi-Fi module is a huge plus, it saves the need to buy a dedicated Wi-Fi card and is very low profile.  The software that comes with this motherboard is excellent too, the fan control from Fan Xpert 2 and the easy BIOS flashing from within the OS is great as well.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Another great purchase, for a Dr Who fan.<br />My sister is a huge Dr Who Fan from, Tom Baker and still now.<br />And after 30 years, her daughter LOVES Dr Who also.<br />She never tires of it, you never know what will happen, with each Time Lord.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I loved the original Footloose.  Saying that, I can also say that I appreciate an updated remake especially when it's done well.  Footloose is an enjoyable movie no matter if it's a blast from the past or dancing in the present.
B000QI2ZWW|2.0|Kinda dissapointed in this movie. I watched part 2 first with my 18 yr old daughter. We got so excited that we rented this from AMAZON. Never have I ever said a part 2 of a movie was better than the first..... theres a first for everything!!! HAPPY FEET 2....
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Once I started reading it was very hard to put it down.  This is the first book that I have read by this Kate Morton and I look forward to reading her others.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|We used this for the Christmas movie at school, the kids loved it.  It's fun to listen to them laugh and giggle.
B004LKRR6U|5.0|Grace is so beautiful, i love this blue dress. Lots of my friends likes her. I may order one more for my friend. It was worthy of buying.
B004SHGBDG|5.0|A great helping device for guitar players! Not only useful but also fun! Three picks made in one minute. The item is rather heavy
B0063IH60K|1.0|I opened the game and hit play. a popup ad for a dating site popped up. immediately uninstalled. I am not looking for hot singles in my area. I just want a decent free solitaire game with a few different styles of solitaire
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is free and has great options and information! There is nothing to &quot;buy&quot; into just install and enjoy!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is very fun but I hats the fact that the only way to get peanuts is through purchasing them. I wish there was another was to earn peanuts instead of just coins.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|I have not put this together yet, I just wanted to mention is was a lot cheaper at the Lego store.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Love this movie! It is funny and my entire family loves to watch it! Definately not just a Christmas time movie in my house!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I didn't want to write a review, just rate the game, but the system requires I write something. I won't. Bother rating the games in the future!

0425252868|5.0|A rare glimpse of a nobel act in WW II.  I enjoyed the history and the characters.  Not all military personnel in WWII Germany were Nazis.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|character is mostly obnoxious - movie is too loud and the scenery is all very dark making it hard to see the characters
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this app before another which was recommended in other commentary. I've found that this is far and away the easier of the two to use. Especially good for those just starting with Kindle Fire.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I thought the story was a bit far fetched.  Does this kind of stuff really happen to people?  Don't get me wrong, it was a good read, but hard to believe.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Better than i thought it would be. Even thought is more blood than i would like, but the store line is good.
B0083EXW50|5.0|I've loved this band for at least 13 years and I'm so glad they came out with another slammin' album and still come around to NY to perform.  Keep it hardcore FF!  \m/
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you like a book with a story line that will keep you engaged to the point that you will not be able to put it down then this is the book for you; Oh and the action is non stop too. One of the best that Vince Flynn has written.
B009F1ZYCO|5.0|I bought this & 3 others for my boyfriend as part of his Christmas gift and he absolutely loves this one & the rest!  Not sure what they sound like and I've seen the reviews for that part which doesn't sound too great, but they are nice visual memorabilia for collectors.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|after six entered events; all subsequent entries were on Dec 31 no matter the date was selected for entry.  I plan on removing this app from kindle fire.
B009IAIBAE|5.0|I bought this & 3 others for my boyfriend as part of his Christmas gift and he absolutely loves this one & the rest!  Not sure what they sound like and I've seen the reviews for that part which doesn't sound too great, but they are nice visual memorabilia for collectors.
B004EPZ084|5.0|The disc came with no scrathes & looks like the picture. Also too funny to be kept quiet lol :)
1416550550|5.0|Kate Morton has a great knack for writing mysterious and intriguing novels set somewhere in England. I've read four of her novels now, and they're all great. This was a good one, and so was The Secret Keeper, her latest novel.
B004L3AR0K|5.0|The disc came with on scratches and plays perfectly. Also it came like the picture is and love this movie.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I love this album! I enjoyed every song from start to finish. Ellie has the most beautiful singing voice :D
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The disc came with no scratches. Also it looks like the picture. Kinda surprised that a movie with no plot would be entertaining.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|VERY ENTERTAINING BOOK. IT WAS RATHER UNBELIEVABLE  IN THE LAST HALF, BUT OTHERWISE BET ENJOYABLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a really really REALLY good game. All the other ones good but i thnk it is good. but it could be a bigger hit than need for speed
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final book....<br />A great way to wrap up the series. I was sad for it to end. Surprised how Katniss felt about the games in the end...
B006LSZECO|5.0|Exciting story full of plot twists and alluring characterization. An easy but enticing read which is difficult to put down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book after I saw the movie. The book is better allowing you to develop the plot/characters. This book moves...I couldn't put it down. Start reading the series you won't be sorry you did!
B005GHN2GG|5.0|What I want from any novel is a good story, and tell it in a way that I feel like I am living it. I want a setting that I can see and feel, characters with depth, a plot that is well thought out and delivered without feeling contrived, and above all else I want romance that isn't shallow, but still steamy. I read tons of novels that come close, but are missing an aspect or two that I need to consider it perfect. This book had every feature I love and was completely unique. It was a perfect story!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book continues the games drama and makes way for the final book of the series. I feel it doesn't move as fast as the first. Can't wait for the movie release. Worth reading
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Time Keeper is a great perspective of different people's importance of time and how it affects their lives. It is a quick read.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|My expectations were around 3 stars but it was clearly better than that.<br /><br />The plot is pretty creative and it tied together pretty well.  It wasn't too hard to follow along with all the time shifting details but it was very interesting.<br /><br />There are some inconsistencies in the time travel facts that they either leverage to their advantage or ignore when it isn't convenient.  If you can just let go of that it is a pretty good movie.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I remember the kid from 3rd rock and amazed at how he kept up with the veteran actors. I give this about a 6.5 out of 10 for story and acting.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun, lots of different puzzles.  I finished this game in about 4 hours. I would recommend for all you hidden object fans.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Been a fan of Zeppelin since the very beginning and am enjoying this digipak, it hits all the high notes and rocks one socks off
B001NP8PQW|5.0|I'm not a die hard fan of the Cure but I do like them. After listening a few times to this concert I found I like them even more! Some of the songs on here don't do much for me but there are others that really shine. The quality of the picture and sound is also what you would come to expect from a Blu-ray and If you are an all out Cure fan this should be a must for your collection!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game was really fun to play. I think that the people who said that it was ok well they must be stupid. And it also proves that. they don't even play the game and it does prove that they didn't even play the first angry brid
B004KV92ZE|5.0|What's not to love- Jack Black, roly poly panda, cute dumplings, inner peace, fabulous graphics and cartoon creativity.  One of the best cartoons around.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's not mindless and it's not brain aching.  It's just a great relaxing game!! Great for waiting for an appointment.
B00846TTDG|5.0|We were very impressed with the remarkable dedication and service that our Navy Seals have. This movie just sealed the respect and admiration that we have for them, as well as our appreciation! We thank them for their ultimate sacrifice and patriotism! We are in absolute awe!<br />We were very moved by the fact that this movie was done by Navy Seals. They did an excellent job! They make you very proud to be an American!!
B0052AC8C6|3.0|it's mostly my fault that this movie is only getting 3 stars from me. I should have known better then to pick it for my 2 year old. The movie is cute and very cool visually but in my opinion too violent for a 2 year old. Animals attacking each other is pretty scary.
B0086700CM|3.0|I got this because it was free.  I ended up actually enjoying it for a little while.  But, my kids seem to really enjoy it.  It's a decent &#34;runner&#34; game for $.99.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Great return of Jack Ryan legacy.  I loved the continuing story of the Jack Ryan family, and development of Jack Jr.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This ranks up there with Where's My Water for me. I want to get 3 stars on every puzzle. And a few ads are a small price to pay to get this game for free.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|As the noise quiets, you are taken upon a journey entirely thought provoking... the uniqueness of this movie is truly amazing.  Slightly disturbing is the mime <?> yet also insightful.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It is not exactly what I call a page turner, but I keep wanting to read further along in it and am looking forward to the second in the series.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|so far this is the best album i enjoyed it alot & it's worth listening to it over & over again
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This is a beautiful doll and is so natural; my three year old granddaughter is thrilled with it.  Appropriately dressed, it could serve as either gender.  My only complaints: the body is a bit too understuffed and it has way too strong of the trademark vanilla scent.  Nearly triggers my asthma.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I would have given this app 5 stars but some puzzles are practically impossible to solve unless you use a hint. Sooner or later you will be out of hints and out of luck.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|The movie just had a strange pace to it at times...I guess I should have expected this from a Wes Anderson movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me on my toes the whole way through!!!!! So very well written and has so many plot turns.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate it because it glitches and I lose all my data.I liked it until they changed it to world tour and that's when I started to not like it at all
B008AT9XOC|4.0|This is a great movie, still one of my favorite musicals! But the reason I bought it - the \\"original ending\\" - is the only version included. I was curious about the original, but I would have still liked the theatrical one included as well. But the Amazon service was great and efficient as ever!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love the music on this CD!  I had to have it after seeing the movie, which was awesome as well! Alittle cheesy at times, but very good. All of the actors did an outstanding job with these songs!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I didn't like the book at first but as I read I enjoyed it more. Just wished it would have started different
B003L77G6A|5.0|My husband and I love this show. We watch the reruns as well as the new ones every week! They make us laugh no matter how many times we've seen them. I have purchased 5 seasons so far. I take them out of town when I go to babysit my granddaughter.  After she goes to bed I watch a couple of episodes on my sons portable player, before I turn in. All the shows are great! I highly recommend them for anyone who could use a laugh!
B004WR125O|5.0|Hooked it up, typed in router passwords, and that is it, receiver is Internet capable, and Pandora sounds amazing, really great product from a great company.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This season is great! Totally different from season 1. Full of suspense and leaves you wanting to watch more! Anyone who loves hooro and suspence will love it as I do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How can you NOT love this show?  Once you accept it's really a period soap-opera and go with the flow, it's quite a fun ride!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books have alot of sex,yes. Some parts were eyeopening. I wish I had read them when married. I would have tried some of the softer.<br />I enjoyed the story behind them. I hope to see a follow-up with the family.<br />I read an average 3 books a week. All genres, I have a teen-age granddaughter. I keep her supplied with books and read everything I send. I want to be able to discuss books with her and make sure the content is good for her.
B004J4X73K|5.0|I love this whole world.  This is another fantasy adventure that leaves me sad every time a book ends!  Hopefully there will be more again soon.  Thank you Lynn Flewelling!
B000VSYDRM|4.0|2007R: At times a visually repulsive, yet carnally provocative film. You can almost smell it! If only one could capture the essence of the beautiful female scent in a bottle, imagine the affect on the world. I could think of less worthy endeavors to spend one's life pursuing. Excellent suspension of disbelief. MFJLabs 4x
B005LAII1C|3.0|This movie def had its funny parts, but its not a multiple watcher.  I rented it from Redbox and glad I didn't actually buy it.  The one-liners are good but nothing I would say \\"I'm bored, lets pop in Ted to get a chuckle.\\"
0670023329|5.0|It is a shame these gulags, these Auschwitz type places still exist. This is one of the last dictatorships still standing and the jailers will pay when the walls fall. Unfortunately many more innocent people will perish before that happens. This is a fine book. Recommended.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I feel this is the best book of the trilogy.  The book was just too long and I feel the author could have gotten her message through in less than almost 600 pages, which is how I felt about the other two books.  The books were so long that they soon became boring.  I felt the books were overated but I did like the suspense this book had in it with the Jack Hyde story line.
0446556750|5.0|The Reversal puts defense attorney Haller on the opposite side, to independently prosecute a convict who was released upon belated DNA analysis. Nothing is what it seems as mysteries abound and Haller's and Bosch's expertise comes in handy to complete the trial. A good mix of legalese and thriller.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Lov ed this in the theater - could watch it again and again.  The singing is tremendous and the cast is great.  I loved everthing about.  Yes, it is more of a chick flick....but I just did nto want it to end
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|As a fan of fantasy fiction books, I discovered this series late in the game. I had heard it was difficult to get into and I noticed it had some mixed reviews. I must say that after reading it, I can't believe the number of negative reviews I've seen!<br /><br />*No spoilers*<br /><br />This book is absolutely captivating! Sure, there is a lot to get into. What reader doesn't need some time to understand the structure and rules of a fantasy world existing only in the author's mind? As creations go, this one is very close to topping my all time favorites list! It is wonderfully complex and original. It opens before the reader one fascinating piece at a time, giving hints at the full scope of things while allowing the reader to digest and speculate of what he or she has seen so far. I actually like the fact that we don't get to know everything all at once. It keeps things interesting and dramatic.<br /><br />I tend to compare all fantasy fiction to Robert Jordan. Erikson is not nearly so loquacious and yet still conveys an excellent sense of the atmosphere during the events of the novel. The perspective of the novel is less constrained than Jordan or Martin, jumping between characters when appropriate, and makes the novel much more intriguing. The characters personalities are distinct and full while somehow remaining... human. I like the fact that no one side is really identified as the \\"good guys.\\" There are shades of gray in each faction, giving the novel a touch of real life. After all, who doesn't start to feel differently about the Seanchan later on in the \\"Wheel of Time,\\" when we get to see their perspective?<br /><br />The pace of this book is another plus. While there is pretty much constant action happening throughout the story (unlike the painful lead-up to awesome climax in Jordan's novels), there is still enough calm periods to effectively prepare the reader for the exciting climaxes. Understanding that this novel is the first of many, the ending is also quite good. Giving some closure while leaving enough unanswered questions and mystery to entice the reader to jump into part 2. Unlike books 4 and 5 of the Game of Thrones (which pretty much killed the series for me), I can't wait to keep reading!<br /><br />I am not a quick reader. I tend to savor the books I love. Diving into the fantasy world and making full use of my imagination as I read. That being said, I finished this one rather quickly, because I couldn't put it down! I give this one two enthusiastic thumbs up!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Because of the dark subject matter, I would only recommend to ages 17+.<br /><br />Loved it!  One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Wonderful development of the characters.  Good story.  Fast paced.  Read in a day!
B009VLX8FS|3.0|I have long been a fan of Ms. Swift's music, and was thrilled to see her achieve such huge success at such a tender age. She is a very talented young lady. However, whether through her own desires to branch out and test her musical abilities, or whether she has been ill-advised to take her pop-country sound all the way to pop to broaden her fan base, this CD full of songs just does not do it for me -- or for her! Best stay with country, Taylor, and let the other pop divas rule the pop music world. If you want to grow musically, you can do that within the country music field by enrichening your depth of music while maturing your lyric writing skills. This CD is a letdown for me, and I am sure, for many of her steadfast fans.
B008CJ0KBU|3.0|The story line could be better. The hero always needs rescuing. The weather is always wet and gloomy. I like the young girl'a acting and persona.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|In a land where the only thing valuable to people is time, this exciting movie puts the whole appreciation of time into a new perspective, one that rarely anybody may see it from that perspective!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Not love, but it is a heads up. We have to get really serious about grumpy old people trying to use religion to take over the world and control our every day lives. This kind of thing has heald up back for over two thousand years.
B0013BCWEW|5.0|Great story, leaves you wanting more! Taking into cosideration that it is based in actual facts, you will find you self looking for answers!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|use to love playing this game as a child back when computers were nothing like they are today, but i just couldnt get back into playing this.  the graphics are nice though.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This is a fascinating book about former presidents and their relationships with sitting and future presidents during some of<br />the most troubling of times.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I avoided pintrest for so long because I knew I would be addicted the moment I signed up.  I have this app on my Kindle Fire, and it makes pinning so simple!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Don't know if I liked or not. Found rather depressing.  Was a good story but didn't like the way story was written.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I love this 25th anniversary concert. The main characters portrayed their parts well especially Alfie Boe, he did very well. I loved his rendition of Bring Him Home, I was really moved to tears. Very good, very good !!!
B000SGSU58|5.0|I love Michael Connelly's writing.  Haven't read all his books but I am working on them.  Harry Bosch intrigues me.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought this for my 3 year old and started playing it with her (she would not have figured it out on her own) and I really enjoy playing it.  Good motor skills for her and logic skills for both of us.  It is a fun way to spend some time together.
B0086700CM|5.0|everbody loves it. i am no exception. such a fun game. as popular a angry birds was/ is. awe some
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For those who are hopelss romantics, you'll really like this book.  Definitely keeps you engaged.  Colleen Hoover is an excellent writer and I'm looking forward to more of her books.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have played it before and enjoyed it, but being able to do it on my Kindle Fire is great. Chsteinecke
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't stop reading this book! Has you on the edge wondering what's going to happen next. Everything comes together perfectly in the end. Highly recommended.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|My daughter suggested this book and I'm so glad she did. An amazing story following a young woman's journey across the Pacific Crest Trail, but more so, the journey she takes inside to heal. An inspirational read.
B0034G4P8A|2.0|I ordered Two Disc Blu-Ray DVD combo but all i got was the Blu-Ray... not worth the money when falsely advertised
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Me and my son like this alot - though I do wish the game clock would run when the game isn't running.12hrs of gameplay for a breeding cycle bites.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Love the movie , highly recommended for all to enjoy. Great story line, Movie was good from beginning to end and no boring moments. The movie is long so don't recommend to put in after midnight for one may get tired and have to fight to stay awake because it so good you don't want to wait until the next day to finish.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful story for any dog lover!<br />I am excited to share with family this story about a brilliant dog!
0385536828|1.0|I guess once you get a reputation as one of the foremost novelists writing in the English language today, anything passes for genius. I can't believe some of the \\"Praise for Sweet Tooth\\" quotes from magazines and newspapers on this Amazon page: \\"page turner,\\" \\"elegant prose,\\" \\"suspense.\\" Let's see: Page turner? Er, no. It put me to sleep every night for the two weeks it took me to get through this. Elegant prose? Sure. The guy can write. Suspense? Not even close. In fact, what is the opposite of suspense?<br /><br />This book flunked my 75 page rule by I pressed on because, after all, it's Ian McEwan. And it took a full 100 pages before anything happened. I read the rest in disbelief and only because I kept telling myself that something was going to happen. Right? Wrong.<br /><br />This is a book about nothing. McEwan chooses to write in the first person. It takes a letter from one of the characters to our narrator to give any meaning to the story. And this is not until the last ten pages of the book! Too little, too late as it reveals an uninteresting and uncompelling story. And why not? It was a uninteresting and uncompelling read.<br /><br />This is my third book by McEwan and I think I've had enough. \\"Atonement\\" was very good, but \\"Saturday\\" was a bore-fest. And now this.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|This was supposed to be able to read forms and pdf files like a computer and it does not! Don't waste your money on it, I was very unimpressed!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Loved loved loved it! Can't wait to read the next book in the saga! I so enjoyed the history of World War I.
160094048X|5.0|This author is very funny and she uses ingredients that i can find in any grocery store.  She also doesn't lecture on the virtues of being a vegeterian.  The ginger molasses cookies are my favorite so far.  I have two of her cookbooks and they are both really good.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's been years, Browncoats, and yet I will persist in the cry for Moar Pls! Fox was insane for cancelling this show. Great story, great characters.

B000OVLINI|5.0|It is one of the best books ever!  I could not put it down.  Pulls you into the story from the first page.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|It has the song &#34;The Dog Days Are Over&#34; on it, which was really good, and I think it had a few more that I may have recognized off Pandora.com, but overall it was just ok. More songs that I wouldn't have bought than I would.
B004I744AS|5.0|It's a dictionary. It defines words. It's free. What more can you ask for? What else do you need to know? It works. 'Nuf said.
B001YB29HG|5.0|Super fun and shiny and geektastic. Totally sing along, laugh and cry. I highly recommend everyone see it at least once and is definitely a great addition to my collection.
0345535413|4.0|The product came exactly as expecting.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase. Well worth the price I paid for it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love The Hunger Games series. Katniss is the perfect heroine. She stands up for what's right and does anything for her family. It's such a rare quality that makes this story and the series so amazing. Catching fire is such a good book that I could read over and over again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive!  I love creating and finding my way through the pipe mazes.  There was one I couldn't do and it is making me cuckoo!  I will keep trying to solve it though.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What an awesome show.  Has some history about the early 1900's and WWI, shows the problems of the different classes during that time period, love the costumes of the times and truly entertaining.
0316228532|2.0|This was one of the longest books that I have ever read.  I agree with another reader that there were too many characters.  I knew from the first page that I was not going to like this book but I decided to finish anyway.  I want the seven days back that it took to read this book.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Didn't think I was going to like it in the beginning because it seemed too much like Twilight, in the way she met someone and instantly can't live without them. But, the book was more unpredictable than I thought. I ended up reading it in a few<br />days and liked it a lot!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|definitely has helped since my kindle plug is loose and doesn't allow me to see when its charging. this app does that!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great CD!!!  If you like Nashville on TV, then you can listen to all the great songs! It was a fabulous Christmas present!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The real review is relatively short and separated from the following rant for ease in reading...<br /><br />You could watch instead:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001NU69LA Planet Of The Vampires]]<br />[[ASIN:B001N3EZW2 Forbidden Planet]]<br />[[ASIN:B000ICXQHY The Thing]]<br /><br />This is about as bad a prequel as Phantom Menace - if anything it may be worse.<br /><br />Overall, it appears to be bad for roughly the same reasons.<br /><br />First, like the Star Wars prequels, the director seems to have started with a bunch of scenes they wanted to do for special effects reasons, then attempted to stitch them together after the fact.  Like Star Wars, the overall concept of what the movie is about and specific scenes either fail to connect or conflict.<br /><br />The characters are illogical and make mistakes, yes, but on a more basic level, they don't make sense as people.  Characters are driven by emotion not logic, so we can't fault them for making the occasional mistake, but the characters act with no motivation or in a way that invalidates previously-established motivation or basic aspects of their character.  As a result, I don't like, relate to, care about any of these characters.  I'm a little bit intrigued by the android until he too turns out to be nonsensical.  By making the actions of people incoherent, contradictory, stupid, and inconsistent, they're made into non-characters.  They aren't believable as people.<br /><br />I'd say there isn't much of a plot, an actual narrative per se.  There is no discernable character arc for any of the characters.  You could describe what happens on their mission in a sentence or two.<br /><br />The film is awfully derivative - there seems to be a lot of borrowing from different places.  Maybe Leviathan.  And Stargate.  Most of this film stole scenes or concepts directly from Alien vs Predator, Alien, and Aliens.  However, the award goes to Star Trek Next Generation season 6 episode 20 The Chase, in which an ancient humanoid race referred to as The Founders is sought by scientists due to the result of archaeological research and found to have seeded their own DNA billions of years ago on other planets, giving rise to other humanoid races including of course humans.  They're kind of albino-ish looking with strong brow ridges and bald heads.<br /><br />So overall, I'd say if you watch something like Forbidden Planet or Planet of the Vampires, you'll be more satisfied.  Maybe even more satisfied with The Green Slime<br /><br />...end of the overview.  But I can't resist going into a few more specific diatribes...<br /><br />========================<br /><br />Some specific examples of bad filmaking<br /><br />LAZY characterization.  The lead female scientist has \\"faith.\\"  Not in Christianity per se but just a generally faith-y disney-its-maaagic kinda person.  How do we know?  Other characters tell her she's a \\"believer\\" several times and she wears a cross.  Yet she's following a line of thinking that directly contradicts the cross she wears.  Maybe she'd have been more believable if she was referred to as a \\"dreamer\\" and \\"mystic.\\"  ...show her hanging a dreamcatcher over her bed, reading Crowley and Chariots of the Gods, have her talk about a few other off-the-wall ideas to establish a general hunger for strangeness and hidden mystery.  As it was, she was a person with two diametrically opposed beliefs and no inner tension.  Worse, she's a scientist and a Christian but believes - without specific evidence - that the figures in various ancient illustrations created humanity so she strays from BOTH her main character traits - her faith and her science.  A person who doesn't even value their own values is difficult to like as a protagonist.<br /><br />LAZY science fiction - they reference \\"ancient civilizations\\" all having the same star map and include Cave Men, the Mayans, and the Babylonians.  So you've got cave painters from 40,000BC, Babylonians from 1700BC, and Mayans from 250-900 AD citedas all ancient and all having the same star map.  What, they didn't want to drop off the same map for Atilla, Constantine, Diocletian or Charlemagne?  With the other civilizations cited, it implies Engineers being constantly on earth interacting with humans for essentially all of human history.  So they were around for 41,000 years, THEN decided they felt like getting rid of us, then at that convenient moment - but not anytime in the 40,000 years before - destroyed themselves with their own weapons just at the perfect moment - and apparently the Engineers at this one facility were the only ones to know this needed to be done.<br /><br />If we are to believe the Engineer in the first shot was on a very early earth, we should remember life started maybe 3.5 BILLION years ago which is a long wait to decide you made a bad go of it.  But let's assume they only intended to modify existing life.  You'd probably need to arrive close to the development of invertabrates to at least have some chance of influencing local evolution to lead to an Engineer-like creature so they could have shown up for the Cambrian explosion which still gives them about 580 MILLION years to mull over the fate of all life on Earth.<br /><br />Of course, to think that various influences that cause mutation leading to evolution - such as cosmic radiation hitting the earth for 580 million years straight - not to mention evolutionary pressures ie a different environment/planet - could possibly allow for CONVERGENT evolution leading to a specific body plan reveals a deep, deep non-understanding of science in general and in multiple disciplines.  Like, this was what they wanted the movie to be ABOUT but they couldn't be bothered to crack a single book on the subject?  Does the story of Prometheus take place in a heliocentric universe by chance?  Or is the Earth flat?  Are humans assumed to be composed of 4 substances/humors?<br /><br />LAZY writing and choice of scenes.  A surprising amount of time in Prometheus is spent setting up the same scenario as a single scene in Aliens - the same plot with the same exact plan - the evil Corporation plans to expose a human being to alien contagion, then transport them back to Earth in suspended animation.  In Aliens, it was a quick, suspenseful scene and it made sense - the corporate guy did it because he was seeking profit at everyone else's expense.  In Prometheus, it doesn't make any sense.  The android has no personal motivation to do it and the guy who owns and controls the corporation is THERE onboard for a completely different purpose than profit - in fact, introducing an uncontrolled unknown never before studied contagion on board could greatly threaten his project and of course his life.  Why do they do it then?  Not for any goal but because er... it's what happened in another Alien movie so... it happens because that's what happens in these movies?  Like, Ridley Scott wanted to make a non-Aliens prequel that was big-concept and thoughtful and did new things... therefore decided he needed to RE-DO the same thing covered by Cameron in the first alien sequel??? WTF?  Lazy, lazy writing to rehash a previously - and well - explored idea.  Characters that work against their own purposes.  If they KNEW a monster would result from the trick, having it inside the ship would kill the crew and perhaps the billionaire and thus ruin his mission and end his life when he came there to extend his life - or if they had no idea what it would do, it hardly made sense to set it loose outside of a lab environment, considering how paranoid they were about living in a lifeboat.<br /><br />Most of the movie is taken up with people doing things that make no sense and things that make no sense happening.  Even making no sense in terms of the plot or story or just the basic idea for the film - such as why rehash previously explored Alien movie subplots? - the movie is about the big picture, alien \\"gods\\" as opposed to alien monsters... but the Engineer we meet is essentially indistinguishable from the no longer sentient crazed spider-monkey former crew member that goes berzerk.<br /><br />Or having the automated medical system software not have any directions loaded for females - wouldn't it come standard?  Wouldn't the old millionaire want it to be capable of helping his daughter who he was dependent on while he was in coldsleep?  Moreover, shouldn't it be unable to operate at all under those conditions?  These are all considerations that reveal the movie as stupid... But consider it from the writer's perspective from outside the story - they planned to have this character do the decathalon within 24 hours of a cesarean section.  Sprinting, jumping, getting smashed by an alien and thrown across the room, jumping and landing heavily on things, climbing, more sprinting, more climbing... assuming the writers decided the same character MUST go through both the operation and feats of athleticism instead of using two different characters or giving her time to heal, do you really want to go out of your way to have the medical system state it is not equipped to take care of women?  Maybe you could argue that futuristic technology makes it all possible but not when you have that technology itself tell the audience it isn't set up to help.  Dumb nonsensical writing.<br /><br />Alien was about a bunch of space-truckers who get re-routed from their normal job by their employer unexpectedly and run into something they can't handle.  They're essentially expendables for a corporation who thinks first of profit and last of their safety.  Despite the fact that they aren't scientists, they still worry about basic safety things like quarantine.  Conversely, the owner of the corporation himself takes his A team out on a mission with him for the purpose of saving himself from death and they appear to be universally foolish, incompetent, and generally not A personality types.  They don't seem to have much concern for each other or even their own lives let alone their jobs.  You'd want a cast of sophisticated scientists and professionals for Prometheus to replace the hapless space-truckers of Alien because you want characters capable of the kind of nuanced, depthful discussions and actions needed to address the \\"big questions\\" of the film.  Instead you have a badly written teenage slasher film with some of the best special effects ever.  I recommend Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer over Prometheus.<br /><br />===============<br /><br />...a small example of character development/character arc in Prometheus:<br /><br />Shaw:<br /><br />(dreamily, flakily) \\"I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators, and I want to meet them.  I believe that because... I believe it\\"<br /><br />(aghast, horrified) \\"we should have never come here. we were so, SO WRONG!!!!\\"<br /><br />(dreamily, flakily) \\"I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators. I want to meet them... so I can ask them why\\"<br /><br />---<br /><br />(terrified, urgently) \\"If you don't stop that ship, there won't be any home to go back to!!!\\"<br /><br />(dreamily, flakily) \\"I want to visit that planet, because I believe they are our creators, and I want to meet them. I'll just show up so they know we weren't wiped out yet and present myself for interrogation - assuming they don't kill me on sight - with an andriod that has a head full of information about Earth and one of their ships with a flight path they'll be able to follow back to this planet, where they'll find the remains of our own ship and our intact lifeboat, both full of information - the navigation databases certainly showing the location of Earth along with, most likely, every major human settlement. ...so I can ask them why.\\"
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|It took a couple of veiwings to like this one,but now I do.The action is amazing and the story is easy to follow.Buy it,you won't be disappointed.
B000002JR8|5.0|This is clearly the heaviest album that Pantera ever came out with. For that reason, it was their number one album. I give Far Beyond Driven two thumbs up, five stars, and whatever else you can put for top ratings.
B00136Q784|5.0|This CD has to be the most under rated CD of all time. It's hard rock and blues-y. Its raw. Its music you chill to. Its just awesome. RIP Layne Staley. One of the best hard rock voices of all time. Now the deluxe edition is coming out!
B003297I1U|5.0|My grandson loves the Bruder toys.  This truck is very large with several moving parts, it even has lights and sounds.  He really likes all of the things it can do and the realistic details of the truck and its equipment.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|A great performance for sure!  I loved it.  I missed seeing Led Zeppelin in 1969 at the Northern California Rock Festival.  I was there but Led Zeppelin was a No Show.  I remember being so dissappointed but JimI Hendrix and Cream made things better.  I would have liked the photo scenes in Celebration to slow up and not change from band memeber to member so quickly.  I also would have liked the camera to show the audience and their reactions more with good closeups of the audience.  There was several decades represented in this audience and it would have been nice to see more of them.  The camera work of Celebration regarding this is the only reason that I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  The performance of Led Zeppelin was superb!  Jimmy Page has always been one of my favorite guitarist going back to the Yardbird days.  Robert Plant still got it.  John Paul Jones still brillant on bass and keyboards, and what a honor to have John Bonham's son, Jason, to complete the band for Celebration Day.  Jason drove the band with his drums, and Dad was watching!  Great job by all!
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This is a great dump truck.  It is very sturdy and can hold quite a load of blocks or whatever my grandson can find to fill it with.  It is very colorful and just a wonderful toy.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I haven't readd the book yet. Easy download with very easythis book doon! to use download software. Hope I can get to read
B005FVNJTS|4.0|Enjoyed reading the book and found it most interesting to read what goes on in a champion`s mind whilst playing.  Also his<br />home life was interesting.
143353083X|5.0|I was referred to this bible by a friend who already had it as an excellent study bible. I liked the product, it is definitely an excellent study bible.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|You can guess the ending half way through the movie.  Overall it's ok.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt's nose job is the most exciting thing.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It is a movie that you have to think a little bit to keep up with what is going on - but it is different than many typical stories so I found it enjoyable to watch.  Definitely violent and not a kids movie.
B003QTWR08|5.0|The title character is very endearing :-).  The movie is perfectly appropriate for children but us entertaining even for grown ups!
B002ECN4P0|5.0|I ordered this CD and shipping was quick.  I received the CD in a few days and it was received in perfect condition due to the excellent packaging by Ion Records in Brooklyn New York.  Sorry for the mix up Ion Records, I had to delete the feedback and wasn't able to leave new feedback for you.<br /><br />I am really rocking out to the Stones songs on this CD right now.  The Rolling Stones were part of the sound track of my youth and early adulthood.  This is a great collection of the Rolling Stones greatest hits to add to my already ample collection of greatest hits by Mick and Keith and the rest of the band.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|This computer animated film looks brilliant on it's bluray release! Not as intricate animation as new films, but the lovable story makes you forget about that!
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Very revealing of the brutality and horror in the North Korean political machine and what they are doing to their own people. The sad thing is we are very aware of what is going on there and sit back and let it happen.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|What can you say...a great end to the Toy Story trilogy! Pixar always sets the visual bar higher on each of their bluray releases!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|You can't go wrong with this one. I thought it would have very similar misic but he did very well of changing it without making you feel you left Middle Earth.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I love non-linear film making styles and this lovable little film does that as well as you could want! Zooey does a great job alongside Joseph in starring roles. Film looks great on bluray!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Really quite predictable and a bit too good to be true - not realistic at all - mindless reading - good for the beach
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This pioneering computer animated film looks brilliant on it's bluray release! Not as intricate animation as new films, but the lovable story makes you forget about that!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun. A lot of the games bring back memories when I was a child. Also, helps with the time to pass when waiting at doctor's appointments or at the airport. Best thing is that it's free!!!
B003JLA4KS|5.0|A must have for any RUSH fan, young or old. Fantastic interviews from musicians and Canadians from all over the spectrum on this timeless band who keeps reinventing themselves. It's not the best looking bluray, but definitely a step up from DVD video.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Such a lovely interpretation of my favorite book. Each time I watch it, it just gets better. A perfect escape!
B009O07NDY|2.0|Hi guys,<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Howard Shore's LODR soundtracks and I was very thrilled when I bought a copy of ''The Hobbit: Special Edition''. I enjoyed it at first, until I went to watch the film and noticed that there were tracks missing. Later on I found out they had simply not been used in the film! Like it has already been mentioned in other reviews, the ''Eagles come to the rescue'' theme and ''Thorin battles Azog'' theme are simply not in the CD I purchased. I was so disappointed! I found the ''Nazgul theme'' played beautifully in the movie and yet it was not included in the CD. Same with the ''Nature theme'' that played with the eagles...WTF!<br /><br />I hope they include them in a EXPECTED new complete score recording some time in the future!<br /><br />Namárië!<br /><br />Caballero de Copas
B005YVTHT0|4.0|The product is a bit on the expensive side ( althought I have paid like $150 for a FFB with pedals, and gas and brake and shifter paddles ).  I really DISLIKE having to use Pedals for gas/brake and shortly after Thrustmaster was acquired by Guillemont, there haven't been any good wheels with gas/brake on the wheel.  (Dancing on the pedals just wears me out).<br />The paddles seems pretty sturdy.  So far, I'm favorably impressed.  The position sensors, for turning, take a bit of getting used to.<br /> It works quite well in SimRaceway ( free game download and 3 free cars - and with this wheel I got a free $10 gift card to spend buying cars or entering &#34;prize paying&#34; races) and many of the features of the wheel are preprogrammed to be functional.  I think for other games (like F1 2012) I'll need to go into the games'  &#34;setup&#34;  and adjust the &#34;Dead Zone&#34; and some other parameters.<br />I'm using it with Windows 7 -- I haven't tried it with Win XP  ( my older wheels worked with XP but aren't recognized by Win 7 - Fooey ! )<br />I bought a second one of these so my son and I could take them to LAN Parties without trying to clamp the old wheel to somebody else's folding table. ( I figured I'd get them while they were 'on sale' because I've never seen them locally ).<br />So far so Good !
B000I9WWCM|5.0|One of my favorite movies and now I can watch on my Kindle Fire....watched it while I was on my elipitcal...it was great!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Easy as apple pie to put on and take off (but why would you).  Once installed it's unobtrusive and doesn't hinder use of the Kindle in the slightest way.  It's a cheap and effective way to avoid scratches on the screen and a busted tablet.  We have quarry stone tile in the kitchen and that stuff is so hard even tupperware breaks when dropped.  This cover has already saved the Kindle from a couple drops by a clumsy kid.
B003TNW044|5.0|I purchased for my 10 year old great niece.  I bought her first and second season and my gift was the hit of her birthday party.  She loved it!  I still watch the reruns on TV...never gets OLD
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I have to admit I am only half way of the book but I couldn't resist writing a review to say how much I am enjoying it.<br />It connects lots of dots for me and open my eyes to many behaviors that were big questions marks .<br /><br />This is the kind of book that makes you feel sad when you finish it because you want to keep reading it forever
B008TMA1LY|4.0|great app that is fun and relatively easy. It challenges you but it is addicting. It gets harder as you keep going but you get better at it. Not recommended for small children that don't understand how to play. it can b too hard for some kids
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Incredible book, highly recommended. It's a fast paced page turner that will leave you rethinking everything you have ever known.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|When The Walking Dead first appeared on TV, I didn't bother to watch because I assumed the show was nothing more than a gore fest. Despite the excellent reviews, I didn't tune in for an episode until late in season 2 -- and i soon realized I'd been missing out on one of the best drama series in recent memory. Yes, there's plenty of gore (what else would you expect when the premise is a zombie apocalyspe?), but the show's pace and timing, acting, writing and production values are all top notch, on a par with such stalwarts as &#34;Lost&#34;, &#34;Homeland&#34; or &#34;Breaking Bad&#34;.<br />Most importantly, this is a character-driven narrative that successfully illustrates all the strengths and failings of the human condition. I've quickly grown to care about the main characters, warts and all, and perhaps this is heightened by the fact that you never know when one person or another will meet their ultimate fate. Then again, new characters are introduced all the time, each with her or her own set of intrigues and motives. Think of it as &#34;Lost&#34; without all the metaphysical ambivalence and gobbleygook, but with a lot more suspense, and with... zombies.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book.......might be a kids books but great for adults also. Love her style of writing.Great story line...didn't want the book to end..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My husband died of cancer five years ago so was I up for a story about living and dying with cancer...not so much. Glad I read it anyway because now it is one if my favorite books I've read this year.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Assuming that this is the 'truth' of what unfolded in the demise of OBL it is an excellent and rivetting account of what actually went on in the training and in the execution of such a mission.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This guy kills alot of bad guys. Invokes his own form of justice. Keeps you interested through out the entire programs.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|If you like a tense thriller, with family twists and turns - this one is definately it.  The story leads one way, then another - the characters are engaging and freaky and the ending is a stunner.  I am very impressed with Gillian Flynn!
B008133MDK|5.0|I am looking forward to Season 3. I rate this 5 stars for the content, the intrigue, mystery and the high level of intelligence to solve a case. Excellant
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I try to to let my life revolve around Facebook but have to admit I don't think I could not have it installed on my Kindle and my Galaxy S3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love English theatre. I love the era and history weaved throughout each episode. The interactions between the servants and the Family Aristocracy is compelling and additive, you can't wait until the next season to come into play.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Well, parts of this movie were hilarious but most of it was only kind of funny.  The ending was kind of goofy too.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works very well.  I have been able to connect to any one of my PC remotely using Internet connections.  Only been using a short time and the interface, controlling remote system without a mouse hasn't been the most intuitive for me.  Speed has been more the acceptable in all but one case and believe that related to the system.
1416955070|4.0|I started reading this book in prep for the movie to be release in April 2013.  What a great book!  I love the addition of more paranormal demographics besides the typical vampires and werewolves!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Wonderful book arrived in a timely manner to my Kindle.  Downloading books straight to the kindle is easy using Amazon.com
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good application that doesn't hang-up or stall very often.  Easy to navigate and loads very quickly.  Have it on all of our electronics.
0765325950|5.0|Finally, the conclusion of this fabulous series. Brandon Sanderson does a wonderful job of wrapping up the series based on Jordan's notes. Read it for the sheer pleasure.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I just use it for a night light. it throws out just enough light to make it easy to sleep.
B007R3B4RG|5.0|Ótimo disco póstumo! O Melhor disco lançado por Joey Ramone! Espero que seja Lançado o DVD também! ! ! !
1405050519|3.0|they should be more specific and tell that this is ONLY the audio book, I have bought book like this one before but they're also come with the book, not only the cd
B007XC9BSK|5.0|Muy buen producto. Esta diseñado para la diversión y el entretenimiento de mi hijo. Estoy satisfecho con la compra que he realizado.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have been wating so long for this I played it on my Frends ipod it is way better than. btd4
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a great book! I loved how Gregg tried to get away from chicken pox the whole book but ends up getting it in the end! =D
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I hesitated buying this movie at first. But I can definitely got my money out of this one.  Its definitely one of the best near future space sci-fi movies I've seen in awhile.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is free and should be.  Really not worth too much.  Might be some better if you look around for it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Book 2 is just as good as the first one. I'm definitely excited to see what will happen in the next book
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi. Intriguing story. A little too much narrative at times. A good read looking forward to the movie.
B005PK553C|5.0|Great show! I feel like I'm in a theater even though I'm watching it in by bed. I have loved each episode. Once the show starts I don't want it to ever be over. I can sit and watch it all day!
B001ED7C58|4.0|This was my first Twilight soundtrack , got it after seeing the DVD of the movie. Muse and Paramore?, needed to listen to them a few times to acquire any taste for them. I think from the start I personally preferred Linkin Park and The Black Ghosts about as well as any of the selections. All of the soundtracks have a score selection, Carter Burwell's Bella's Lullaby is on this CD and is the best part of the score CD even though I don't &#34;get&#34; anything lullaby about it.<br />Now, if only you could download specific tunes here at Amazon or iTunes.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Fantastic! She has matured and seems more comfortable in her craft.  Susan is courageous and tenacious..........I wish her all greatness.
B0029O08WA|4.0|In my original notes for &#34;Twilight&#34; I noted 4 or 5 tunes that I especially liked, this CD might do better than that one did. Still an odd, to me anyway, assortment  but I made note of Death Cab for Cutie, Tom Yorke, Lykke Li, The Killers, Anya Marina; just about any of the selections except Band of Skulls, OK Go, Hurricane Bells and Grizzly, pretty good results for a CD  these days. I don't regret buying the soundtrack even though I'm probably way past the age market the music was intended for.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I give it one star no pics no NOTHING needs more pizazzzzzz needs more excitement it needs more excitement for kids. One star
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Very enjoyable flic! Was very surprised. I'll be honest, I was just looking for something to watch since I couldn't sleep but wow! I was very pleasantly surprised! Much better than the previous version, the Dredd character here is a squared away combat vet and needs no campy lines or drama to get the job done.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2LYG0AQHIE7PJ]]My 2 year old has shown little to no interest in puzzles of any kind.  We have wooden puzzles, peg puzzles, and shape-sorter puzzles, but our physically active boy wants to run and jump - not sit still for puzzles.<br />We tried downloading this to our Kindle Fire and I couldn't believe how interested my active little guy was!  He loved it right away and wanted to be able to do it, but couldn't get his fingers to do the right thing.  For about a week, either my husband or I had to hold his hand, and guide his finger to the right place every time.  Within about 2 weeks he could do the easy puzzles, but not the harder ones with lots of little shapes.  By this time, once he could successfully do some on his own, he finally \\"got\\" how fun puzzles were & started playing with his wooden puzzles for the first time, which was so exciting for us!<br />Now, about a month after downloading this, he can go through the trains, boats, and planes levels all on his own without any help.  He's also blossomed with his ability + interest in wooden puzzles, which makes this mom happy, too.<br />I don't know what other platforms this works on, but it's fantastic on our small (original) Kindle Fires!!!
1475143389|5.0|First off, I would like to tell perspective buyers how well this book is written. The layout from the front page to the back is well done. Michael does a great job of keeping the book down to the essentials. I really wish that I read this book 5 years ago when I started my journey to a better body, because this book has EVERYTHING you NEED to GET STARTED! Everything I've learned over the years, from internet forums to tips I've learned from friends I've made at the gym, this book has everything you need to get started. The more I read into the book, the more I knew Michael knew what he was talking about. There were things in this book that I either didn't know, or was unsure of, and he does a good job of making it crystal clear what you need to do to SUCCEED at getting whatever type of body you want.<br /><br />Even for the guys who are seasoned veterans in the gym, you can still learn things from this book, as I know I did. A lot of the things I read in this book I've already knew, but there were a lot of MAJOR things that I did not, and for $10-15, this book is well worth it. I've read from some reviewers to save your money, because they were unhappy with the fact they learned nothing new. Yes, there will be some people that may have this problem,  but a majority of you (like myself) could gain valuable knowledge reading this, instead of spending countless hours on forums, websites, etc that could very well mislead you. I value my time, and this book does a great job of letting you know EXACTLY what you need to get the body of your dreams.<br /><br />The only thing this book doesn't necessarily give you is how to properly execute all the workouts in his proposed workout plans; however, that's not the purpose of this book. It does; however, do a great job of telling you how to execute (with good form) the Squat,  Bench Press, and Deadlift. Of course, when it comes to learning exercises with good form, you'll want to refer to other books like &#34;Strength TrainingAnatomy&#34; by Frederic Delavier to name an example.<br /><br />The nutritional information in this book is excellent. He keeps it simple, so that literally anyone could follow these guidelines (as long as you are motivated and have discipline) to achieve the body you want. He even outlines which supplements work and don't work, so that the average Joe doesn't have to spend tons of money buying into products that don't work (which I've also tried myself).<br /><br />Overall, this book is extremely practical, concise, and is a GREAT first step (or continuing step) to get you looking the way you've always wanted. I've been an Amazon Prime member for 3 years now, and this is the first review I've ever done on this website. It is that good! I will definitely post a follow-up on my progress, but as of now I am already seeing some definition in my abs (which has been my goal from DAY 1) and I am a week and a half into the program (been stuck at 15-18% body fat for the last 6 months, starting at 30% about 5 years ago). Cheers Mr. Matthews, as I was once blind, and now can see =]
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The story is well structured, epic,  passionate, with an unlikely ending. I wept for 10 minutes...on an airplane!<br />Thank you, dear Lanette, for urging me to read it.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Far too much sexual content. Foul langague. Concept of the movie was more than stupid. ONE STAR IS EVEN TOO HIGH A RATING.
0071752854|5.0|I read through Pitch Anything in a few hours because I could not put it down. Oren has developed and shared social techniques that help you to gain control of any pitch or selling situation.<br /><br />I have implemented his ideas and they work, hands down. It does take some audacity to try them, but it is worth the effort.<br /><br />This book is unlike so many others in the space. Buy it, read it, use it. I have found it work wonders in my business My Agent Ethan.

B004C0WVP6|1.0|This HDD worked fine out of the box.  Seagate tried to cheat me on the warranty, so please make sure you check that while you still have the box / receipt.<br /><br />It worked great for about 4 months and then disappeared.  Seems they have a similar firmware issue to the 7200.11 series.  Seagate insists this isn't so, but data recovery firms tell me otherwise.  I saved money on this drive, but it's going to cost me in the end.  I'd suggest you try a manufacturer that knows how to write firmware and will correct their obvious errors.
B0043X1FOK|3.0|The movie worked, and is nice cover and cd. Thanks. Worth the money paid for it. The movie is a good movie.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I never wanted to sleep.<br /><br />Martin creates a dozen threads and then weaves like a master. You can see how one path chooses by one character effects the rest. That is, if you can see it. The surprises were gut punches. A friend accidentally spoiled a major death. Even knowing the person wasn't going to make it .... I still was floored by the when.<br />He is a master and few are on his level.

0307887448|3.0|This work is caught in a double-bind. It reads like a young adult's novel, complete with an ordinary, slightly overweight teenager whose avatar becomes a cyber-hero in the virtual gaming universe called the OASIS, against a harsh futuristic dystopian landscape. However, the pop culture references littered across the pages with admirable ease (that would send any 80s junkie/geek to 7th Heaven) are likely to appeal to Gen-X-ers, who would find these references thrillingly recognisable, and likely to be lost on the contemporary \\"Hungry Games\\" youth market.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the lack of familiarity, the latter group would still be able to empathise with and root for the underprivileged protagonist Wade Watts, who battles teenage infatuation and heartbreak even as he searches for the Easter Egg that worldwide gamers are competing for in the virtual universe when the creator of OASIS dies. Aptly, he chooses the avatar name Parzival, a variation of King Arthur's knight, Percival, who is known for his quest for the holy grail. Perhaps the 80s references and the teen hero are also selling points for the novel because together, they manage to appeal to readers across the spectrum.<br /><br />The plot is fast-moving and Cline moves it along expertly with rather engaging scenes, and no wonder, given his background as a screenplay writer. (It would no doubt make an exciting Hollywood blockbuster, although clearing the copyright/trademark restrictions for the plethora of games, movies, TV series and other products that appear in the novel might prove to be a legal nightmare for Warner Brothers).<br /><br />However, perhaps what is commendable about Cline's detailed pop-culture referencing also results in some rather awkward and goosebump-inducing passages, like these:<br />When explaining how hard Wade tried to crack the code in the lines of a clue, Cline tells us he did so \\"until [his] brain began to feel like Aquafresh toothpaste.\\" Elsewhere, when he is under siege bythe evil corporate troops, Wade describes the attack: \\"They were here to cut open my apartment and pull me out of it, like a chunk of Spam being removed from a can.\\" Shudder shudder.<br /><br />Not the sharpest writing, but sinfully enjoyable nonetheless.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I did not appreciate having to go through multiple advertisements before each game of sollitare presented itself to be played therefore I did not rate the app as highly as I would have.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|January 14, 2013<br /><br />Dear Friend,<br />  I read this book after my friends had seen the movie recently and said they had enjoyed it. Cover to cover it covers the experiences Charlie experiences. The book has many themes, but it's mostly about Charlie learning to appreciate the gifts in life that his aunt Helen has given him; one--family, and two, friends. This is one of my favorite books and like Charlie, I will surely share it.<br /><br />  Love always,<br />  Albert
B005LAII12|5.0|This movie is very funny.. unrated version adds a few funny scenes and some great deleted scenes. This movie is a classic!
B008D30K7E|5.0|Simply brilliant! I couldn't put this book down once I'd started it. Starting with an eccentric hundred year old man not wanting to celebrate his birthday in a home, deciding to escape with no plan to mind! The story quickly develops in the most unexpected way. Parallel with his life story spanning the last century, makes for a fantastic read.
B006M4F67A|3.0|good easy to see game to simple for a experienced player; but good for a beginner. I recommend as a way to improve eye hand coordination.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game.  I love to play this one also on my computer. I am glad I got it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|would have preferred paying for the app and have unlimited coins. without waiting 30 seconds. l will probably stop playing when waiting for coins gets old.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|have a lot of fun with this one. I also have this on my computer. I play it all the time.
0060516070|5.0|This book and the Practice of Management would be the 2 books I would put together as my recommendation for the core of any library of an aspiring manager.<br />There are few shortcuts to fame here, but plenty of guidance to the building of values, skill and competence in the practice of general skills in management. I thoroughly recommend it.
B0013KEBEW|5.0|I like it so much ，and everone told me that's very nice when they met me~~~~~so i will be put it everday~~~~~~~~~~~
B000NNXEH0|5.0|I first saw the Magnificent Seven (Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen) as a child. I did not become aware for 10+ years later that the film was based on this earlier piece by Akira Kurosawa.<br />This film is an earlier (post war) black and white film which tells a story closely followed by the western made quite a fews years after it was released. It is subtitled. The acting (of some of the villagers and of the character, Kikuchiyo, played by Toshiro Mifune) is a little theatrical (exaggerated for effect) but the film remains easily understood and enjoyable for this.<br />The film is alternatively sad, funny and uplifting. The writing and acting leave contemporary film (for the most part) well behind.<br /><br />Seeing this film toom me on a hunt for other works by this director and led me to discover films (Judo Saga, Sanjuro, Yojimbo etc) which I now enjoy also.
B0018OFN4U|5.0|My teenaged son and i watch this together on a regular basis. It's become a &#34;cult classic&#34; at our house, and we're always quoting from it when we talk. It is VERY gory, which i normally hate, but it's so funny that for me it's worth putting up with the gore.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Have enjoyed listening the tracks with which I was familiar before purchasing this album, however did not find much that appealed to me among the remainder.
B005LAIGQ4|4.0|Overall, a really great feel good story, with a variety of characters and great dialogue that had me laughing and choking up along the way.  I always know a story is good, if I'm talking back to the screen.<br />This movie is inspired by a true story, and follows the trials of a tiny town in Alaska as they band together, to help save some whales who go stuck in the ice, along with the Eskimos, U.S. Government, National Guard, Green Peace, and even the USSR makes an appearance.  I know, unlikely bed-fellows, who end up working together to help free the whales from the ice.<br />I was surprised by how good this story was.  It grabbed me, got my heart even, and wouldn't let go.  And I adored the unique and different characters.  Variety in characters is so important.  And amusing dialogue, good casting, and good pacing.<br />This is also a pretty good family movie, though the baby whale ends up not making it.<br />I would purchase this, and re-watch it.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I absolutely love this picture.  I just don't have enough words to describe it.  I will guard this with flashlight.  Beyonce did this lady justice.

B002ONIST6|5.0|Excellent cast and excellent acting. Definitely worth renting over many other titles currently available. One of Denzel Wasington's better performances.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I had to actually hide this one.  I let friends play it and they tried to leave it in their CD player.

B0067RQYNW|4.0|I'm an author with 5 kids. I'm constantly finding myself in waiting rooms or in the car with free time on my hands that I could be using to write, but my current work in progress is always back at home on my computer. I have been looking for a program that I could download to my Kindle Fire and Android smart phone that would enable me to carry my current work in progress around with me where ever I go. Kingsoft Office is that program. I've only had it a week so far and I'm still getting familiar with some of its features, but I've already found myself in a position of waiting on one of my children and used the time to write because I could assess my manuscript through Kingsoft Office. I do have to make sure the latest version of my manuscript is uploaded through Google Drive, but that's a big deal. I keep the manuscript there, make additions when I'm ready, and it automatically saves the file in Google Drive for easy access. The spreadsheet option in Kingsoft Office has also made grocery shopping easier because I make my grocery list in an Excel spreadsheet and can access it on my Kindle Fire as well. Love the program! It's saved me a lot of time and made my downtime more productive, too!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Sorry but I am sure the author can come up with a more interesting story. Nothing in the book made me want to read it in detail.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy read<br />Good for teenagers<br />Trying to figure out how to end this book..kindle is making it hard to figure out.....I just want to return my borrowed book
B0090O07S2|4.0|You've seen various film of these guys.  Most of it is okay.  This is way beyond that.  I think RK is a little subdued because of limited access to amplifiers (despite the illusion that he's using a wall of them, he's plugged in to only one) but otherwise this is a strong Doors show and the visuals make up for any slight lack of edge in the guitar department.  JM is at his theatrical best, especially in Unknown Soldier.  Consider the context.  Nothing like this existed back then.  I was highly entertained and I have watched this show repeatedly.  Bruce Botnick reveals interesting trivia about the audio in the bonus features.  The TV bonus stuff is a joke, but a funny one.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|A great story. Read it in just a few days. Never a dull moment and very cleverly written and researched.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Use this app to get out of bed each morning.  Easy to set up and easier to use.  Oh yeah, its also free.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This book is a lovely exploration of universal themes such as love, loss and loneliness - sounds trite, but believe me this is not a trite story. Told beautifully with insightful observations of human nature alongside the natural beauty of the English countryside, I found this book compelling. Harold sets off one day to post a letter and so begins - unexpectedly - a journey in both the physical and metaphysical sense. Various people find themselves along the way, and there's a strong sense of the rightness of redemption throughout.<br /><br />And if all that sounds a bit heavy, believe me it is not. It's a good read, with a strong storyline and beautiful writing. I couldn't put it down.
B008N1V11U|4.0|good game, fun to play and great time killer. some missions get a little repetitive but most games like this do.
1423136802|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my grandson -- he was thrilled with the Christmas gift of these books..
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like the BBC News app in that it reports news stories oftentimes overlooked by American Media.  It also reports stories American Media either skips over or just barely touches.  I have had this app long enough to see it undergo various stylistic changes, some better than others, but the news reporting, the reason I got the app, is always solid.<br /><br />A good app for those who want news presented in a unbiased fashion.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app has more features than the free version. excellent app. definitely helps maintain your battery life. go get it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know what to say..the book is beautifully written...the tragedy of it all brought me to tears and the romance of it all gave me butterflies!  A must read!

B002WV5A9G|5.0|I now know that Star Trek has been passed onto a new and able cast. The new McCoy, Kirk, Scotty, and Spock, especially, are incredible likenesses of the originals in the television series. I'm very pleased, and I'm sure Gene is smiling down on this one.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Like many of you who will read this, I was hesitant about buying lav mics. There is always positive and negative feedback. Here are my 2 cents. When I received the package I immediately read the instructions and began testing. I used 3 separate recorders, a Zoom H2, a Sony ICD, and An Olympus voice recorder. I can say with fair certainty that the audio from all 3 were good enough to use in an indie film, or homemade movie.  You are not gonna get Hollywood results from this, but if you just need a lav mic that can take a beating this is it! The recorder that had the least amount of noise overall was the Zoom H2, but not by much, you could use a regular recorder in a pinch and be completely fine. A few words of advice, when doing any kind of project, make sure you do a sound test. Always! Nothing worse than shooting for 2 hours to have to re do it again. Also make sure to always put fresh batteries in this and you will be completely happy. Would I recommend this product absolutely!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This product has everything you would want and moore.<br />it has the option to go premium,  which is fairly cheap, but so far I have found no reason to upgrade. it also automatically sync between all of your devices. very very useful and helpfull

B004OA6KIS|4.0|Interesting to follow the feelings of a man in his objective approach to existance.  So many socio-political problems seem trivial when viewed from a detached objective point.  Should be required reading for all government employees.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app. It has so many different levels and is really fun. I find you get faster and faster as you continue to play.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I found this book quite confusing at first, as you are just thrown into the situation and most of the story is disclosed through a narrative by the housemaid to a new tenant. I'm also just starting to get used to the way people were referred to back in those times. One character can wear many names: Miss Earnshaw, Miss Catherine, Missy, Cathy, Mrs. Linton; makes it appear there are five characters right there instead of just one. Although I did eventually figure out that Cathy was actually Catherine's daughter, but I still have a hard time keeping characters straight in classic books.<br /><br />  While I probably wouldn't classify this book as a page turner, when I do set it down, I don't set it down for long. I often can't wait to pick it up and hear more of the story, hoping it will all makes sense eventually. One is told the characters at the present time of the book, the housekeeper starts her story with a completely different situation, and as the story unfolds I cannot help but wonder what could possibly transpire to get the cast of characters where they are \\"today\\".<br /><br />  I'm torn between hatred of Heathcliff and pity. Was he heartless because he was a scoundrel or because his heart had been broken to bits?<br /><br />  I still find it hard to understand dialogue when it is spelled phonetically based on the character's speech patterns. Mark Twain is also known for doing this. I find it easiest to read these passages aloud and pray my family doesn't think I am nuts. But still I found that I couldn't understand a word that Joseph said. The gist of what I did get from him, he probably wasn't saying anything very nice anyhow. It doesn't seem that he had ever heard the adage \\"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\\". I'd have sacked his sorry butt and sent him packing if I had been lord of the manor.<br /><br />  Is it just me or were people more apt to fall ill back then? The housekeeper/narrator had been out in the rain and gotten her feet wet. As a result she was bed ridden for THREE weeks. Jane Bennet, in Pride and Prejudice, was sick for months after getting caught in the rain. One could argue that we have better doctors today, though I'm not sure I would agree, or that they didn't have Nyquil back then. Personally, I often get caught in the rain without need of either a visit to my general quacktitioner or over the counter cold medicines. There were other illnesses where the cause of which seemed strange to me, but I don't want to go into specifics for fear of giving away too much of the book.<br /><br />  One thing I found humorous, the main female character compares a situation in her life to a passage in another book which I just finished.feet wet.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|A great book as always by the amazing Nicholas sparks. He never disappoints. Can't wait for a movie to come
B004RPRXV8|5.0|This is a beautiful and thought provoking sci fi story.  The story of Will and Lyra will resonate with all of you.
B006YC74E8|2.0|I was really excited and hopeful even though I figured it would not work... and it didn't. To only be able to take pictures of yourself and those things and persons behind you is kind of, well, yuk. And the quality of the pictures were not good (I deleted them all).
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|This movie is really odd and boring. Its definitely a b rated movie. The 80's Judge Dreddd was much better.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it' pretty good.  you just have to make sure you fill out the entire code 100% or else it won't let you go to the next level. other than that, it's pretty good.
0762439009|4.0|Got this as a gift for someone. He likes it, but I was disappointed that the book enclosed was more like a pamphlet. My only complaint.

0307455874|5.0|This book was received in good condition.  All the pages are there and is not torn or such which makes my reading enjoyable
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Loved all the instruments! So much talent! If you love Dave Matthews and Cold Play, you'll love Mumford and Sons!
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I had heard great things about this movie from many people - let me just say, DISAPPOINTED.  I laughed out loud probably once during the whole movie.  Cursing isnt really funny (and this movie was foul with it), and the emotional plot line was lame, especially since this was supposed to be a comedy.  Would not recommend it to anyone unless they were someone like the character that Mark wahlberg played in this movie.  Dumb and Dumber is one of my favorite movies, so I can't say I don't like slapstick stupid comedy, but this was just....bad.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|After reading the original &#34;Confessions of a Shopaholic&#34;, I had to get the entire series.  I love the way that Sophie Kinsella writes, even though it is British humor, I end up laughing the entire time.  Becky, even though she is super indulgent, is a fun loving character.  Maybe one day she will learn from her over spending.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book. Different for Nicholas Sparks, but definitely one of his best books to date. I enjoyed the entire book.
B000FC10WU|5.0|You can't go wrong with Agatha Christie.  I read the book in one sitting and was kept guessing the whole time.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Love this movie. great sservice. blah blah blah balh Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Al Alan Ala Alan
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a very nice little bag. I usually end up donating bags that I get free with purchase, but I plan to use this one. It isn't as nice as my larger ThinkTank bag, but I was in need of something smaller so this will work nicely. My biggest complaint is that it says amazon on the zipper pulls.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Love this movie. great sservice. blah blah blah balh Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Alan Al Alan Ala Alan
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It made you think and wasn't just your mindless action movie.  Willis and Gordon-Levitt do a great job of playing the present and future looper.  I'd see it again.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I can't imagine watching a better movie. This is a culmination of several other movies before it that set the stage for the Avengers. The entire series was well done and each had it's own tie-in to the Avengers movie. About the only thing I can imagine being better would be Avengers 2.  :-)
B000001I0K|5.0|The Cramps were among the greatest of what came to be the &#34;hardcore&#34; artists of the many in the late 70s/early 80s.This is an album and a half,so the price was nice and the delivery is nothing short of the back-alley style of twangy punk guitar and vocal styles that ruled the era.
B001LM1456|5.0|I expected this movie to be an epic fail like Hulk movies before it. But I wanted to watch it because I knew it tied in with the Avengers movie. My wife was very skeptical but also wanted to see how it all ties in. So we watched it and loved it. Great, great movie. Don't let previous Hulk movies tarnish your idea of watching this one.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Would highly recommend this book. The fifth  star is missing because of the way the relationship between the hero and<br />his lady was introduced. The timing or the introduction seemed out of sync with the style of the rest of the story.But the relationship was vital and a great read, just perplexing the way it was introduced.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Like it my husband is very happy with this product and has recommended this to his friends. Gives an accurate distance for each shot on the golf courses. More confidence on distances.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|I tired making a few things form this book and they have turned out horrible. I followed each recipe step by step and the food was almost in edible. I have not ever had this issue with any other cook book I have used. If you are looking for recipes avoid this book he has no idea what he is talking about.
B000I5SY5U|4.0|Very clever script describing the rise of Nazcism  in prewar Germany in a Cabaret Show in Berlin and a love story.  Great choreography and acting.
0061733199|5.0|I gave this to my son-in-law for Christmas and after perusing through it I want one for myself as well so I will be purchasing a second one.  This book has everything!  Very quick delivery and a no hassle purchase.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Best period piece yet! Season 1 and 2 were spectacular so I figured that we<br />had to watch it from start to finish before Season 3 was aired...great time.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|This was a great gift to receive for the holidays.<br /><br />I've enjoyed sharing it with my 2 year old son. He quickly learned that it was to fix things.  For those of you that care this is a great non-violent toy.<br /><br />The ultraviolet ink and light don't really work well together.  But the pen side is good.<br /><br />It fits well in the hand and seems durable from the playing we've done with it.  The mold seams aren't sanded off very well.<br /><br />It is about $20-$15 too expensive.<br /><br />But it is fun and I like imagining I am the doctor with it.<br /><br />Now if only I could get a nice TARDIS.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Our daughter who is 12 years old has been begging us for this forever. Every year she wished and wished for it. We were so excited to be able to surprise her with it and she has watched it many times. It is in a very nice book type box. Very nice for Star Wars fans.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Next best thing if unable to go watch it on stage.  The movie is great, the acting is phenomenal but nothing replaces the pure joy and perfection of these songs being sung by proffesional vocalist. Alfie was the perfect Jean VaL Jean after Colm.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Can't remember the last time that I was so disappointed with the ending of a book! As so many others have stated, it was a great plot that went nowhere. I read it because i figured there must be a reason that it was on the bestseller lists for so long. The first 2/3 of the book was good. After that, it literally died...
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I consider myself a lover a children's animated features, and when a movie puts me to sleep, that says it all.
B0019LZV4E|4.0|It was very good but you must like the dark side of the genre to really get into it.Johnny Depp does a good job with Sweeney and Helena Bonham Carter is okay.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Great toy . Two winner companies , Lego and minecraft team up and as expected it is wonderful . Did find the price of this sold out toy a bit steep my child is thrilled with it . He claims \\" Steve \\" is fabulous . Would defiantly recommend this item
B006YXTRHY|3.0|My wife likes the Twilight movies, so I've sat through them with her.  I'm more of an old school vampire fan, but I found myself enjoying parts of it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Absolutely one of the best reads in a long time! I can't wait to read the next one!
B005UG542S|5.0|We love the entire HP series of books and the movies have mostly lived up to expectations.  The conclusion of the series was exactly what we hoped for.
0802473156|5.0|This book was exactly what my husband and I needed before we tied the knot! Our pastor had us read it before he would marry us, and I feel it truly made a difference in our relationship and in understanding each other.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|Very funny movie.  All the villains were easy to detest (although I'd have a hard time turning Jennifer Aniston down for anything).
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Hands down one of the most touching, raw, and honest stories I've ever read. Definitely going recommend it to all of my friends and family.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son had so much fun opening each window to find a new Lego each day! The calendar was fun & exciting!
B00004YM0D|5.0|The product was delivered exactly as described. I am very happy with it and love the music on the album.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|This movie was given as a gift, but I also own it.  Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh are superb actors in this movie.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was a great source of finding words .<br />It helped a lot when I needed to find the meaning of a  word .
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I just got this game and it is so fun. I really like the fact that when you pull the birds back on the slingshot it gives an aim on where it is going. The creatures are very cute in their outfits and the use of weapons is a lot of fun. I have never seen Star Wars so I don't know how true to the movie the outfits and weapons are but it is such a great game!!!
B000OCXIDK|3.0|I took the e-book with me to Holland when I went this fall, and I thought it evoked the lives of people in the 17th century when Vermeer painted. In Delft, I could imagine this girl in the streets, running her errands, making out with the butcher's son, visiting her family, etc. But I wish I'd gone to the Hague and seen the painting.
B009ME47H2|3.0|My daughter states its just ok because there are better apps to spend time on and this one is not fun.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Every fan should have this or one of the other version in their library of movies.  Great fun, just like at the theater
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter loves this game because she can take care of animals and it gives you different information on different germs, bacteria, and things like that.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|You willl never guess who did it. There is not a dull moment. The book captivates the reader as if you were actually on the train.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|I watch this about once a year and have for over 3 years, and I see more and more of the nuances each time. There is not a lot of gratuitous violence (like in many &#34;thrillers&#34;) as it focuses on a compassionate doctor's efforts to stay out of prison while trying to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford are both excellent in this film.
B006GHA9VQ|3.0|It is inconceivable to me that Mr. Weber concocted this so called sequal.  Frankly, with the enormous success of the first one, it is mind boggling.  My guess is it is because that everything he has done since has been a flop;Aspects of Love, Sunset Boulevard, Whistle Down the Wind etc so I guess he felt this would be a sure thing.  It just goes to prove \\"You can fool people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the  people all of the time.\\"  Nevertheless,  I found myself spellbound by this piece on the second viewing, so who am I to judge?  The DVD of Phantom at Royal Albert Hall is also superb.
0736092269|5.0|This book is great if you are willing to take the time to really learn about your body so you can build your body the way you want it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the best book I have read thus far!!! It could not put it down!!! What an emotional roller coaster! A must read!!!!!!!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I really like the cinematography of the movie. This movie dealt with the Holocaust in a &#34;soft, round-about way&#34; which was not so disturbing to the senses. It had an ending though that I would never have guessed. So sad
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun game to play! It is a good stress reducer. I would recommend it anyone to play it. Please try it.
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Just love the Goo Goo Dolls that's all. I'm a music lover of all kinds of music and they play it well.
1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens' 'Mortality,' brief though it may be, is nonetheless a powerful and poignant examination of the heartbreaking importance of senescence. This is pure Hitchens--that impossible combination of compassionate and deeply thoughtful insouciance. His wife and editors have held nothing back here, nor did Hitchens himself. A truly beautiful last work by a man that will be deeply missed.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Very handy to check your remaining battery life when your device is in use. No need for guessing at the default meter. Just drag the toolbar down and get an accurate power check.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my father who is an avid watcher of the series!! Loved it!! Not for the faint of heart!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the ease at which the game is to play .I enjoy it holds my interest and I would recommend it to everyone
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I bought this book months ago when it was at a special price, and I liked the book, but it really wasn't what I was expecting.  I don't know why I was expecting this story to be different, but I was.<br /><br />Maybe it's because the novel is a suggested \\"If you like this...\\" for books like 50 Shades, making it sound like it would be more sex-driven.  In reality this book is super tame and practically PG-13.  Oh, sex is mentioned a lot, but quickly and not descriptively.  In fact, the characters themselves are very ambiguously described.<br /><br />Or maybe it's because the book jacket description makes it seem like Travis tricks Abby into something she doesn't want to do (live with him) like some sort of evil villain.  I've read so many books where the H tricks the naive/virginal h into living with him so he can seduce her -- but that's not really what happens here.  They are already friends and already living together.<br /><br />Or maybe it's because I was expecting the characters to be a little more mature.  The characters are in college, but it reminded me more of high school.  Travis is constantly in fights and Abby and Travis argue like dramatic 15-year-olds.  Maybe it's because I went to a large university, but my college experience wasn't that rumor or clique driven, but high school was.<br /><br />The reality is, I think I'm too old to truly appreciate this love story.  I'm only 27, but I found their romance to be a little too juvenile.  I found myself rolling my eyes when everyone is mooning over the one hot guy in school and he falls in love with Abby at first sight.  And while I'm all for an alpha male, I'm honestly surprised Travis wasn't arrested for his violent behavior.  That being said, it was an enjoyable book.  The author likes to throw in ridiculous events and then just pretend they never happened (i.e. mobsters, death threats, car chases, fires, etc.), but it didn't hurt my reading experience.  I don't know if I would pay full price for it though.gh.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read a Stephen King book for a number of years.  My husband read 11/22/83 and was raving how good it was so I bought it for my new Kindle I received for Christmas.  I was putting off reading it since it was so big and heavy.  I usually read at night in bed and found that reading on the Kindle is so easy.  I love the book/
B006LSZECO|4.0|Entering the convoluted mind of a woman who appears--at first glance--to be lucid, fun, generous, desirable is similar to embarking on a journey into madness. This \\"girl\\" is, in many ways, still a child--self-absorbed, petulant, manipulative. A psychologist would have a field day with her, as does the reader. There are many levels, and most readers--I think-- enjoy watching the peeling away of each one.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|Worth watching but very much of a &#34;formula&#34; horror movie.  We figured it out less than half way through.  Good popcorn is a must.
1400049628|3.0|But it was a gift and that someone<br />Liked it so is good not too bad for the price !
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|there were only like a couple of good songs.  Very dissappointed in this cd, thought she could of done better
B00ARF92HK|1.0|This movie was just ridiculous.  The plot sucked, the acting sucked, the characters sucked, the graphics were suck, this was a dumb movie.
B009P5S11G|2.0|This cd was a dissappointment.  It only had like two songs i even liked.  I guess she is past her prime
B00992CF6W|5.0|A lot of people didnt like the price of this game but its a realy good value.the other versions sell for about twenty bucks. the game is great and is a good game to start on for people who havent played minecraft before. i reccomend this game to anyone who has any crativity and is bored of games where u just kill people.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Couldn't put it down - more than I expected - looking forward to the next couple of books -
0783225849|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. I always loved the movie psycho. the quality of the DVD was excellent. received the purchase as scheduled and in perfect condition.
0788859544|1.0|The movie froze and wouldn't play past scene 6 disappointed I really wanted this movie for my grand daughter contacted them sent movie back will see how they handle from here
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm obsessed with Pinterest! Love being able to access it on the go. I use this app on my galaxy s3 and kindle fire HD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it only gets better! I absolutely love this app for the kindle! repinning is a breeze as is searching and the pins always load.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Excellent movie, all of the ice ages are great, but I think this might be the best one, worth getting, and delivered fast.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this book to be really well-written and it was definitely a page-turner as all my friends had described. Unfortunately I figured out the first big twist fairly early on and I found that the subsequent twists just seemed to get more and more unrealistic as the plot progressed. Nonetheless, it was easy reading.
159315724X|5.0|This book is amazing. I am a huge fan of Darren Hardy because of it. The Compound Effect will take you to new levels. It may seem short but it is definitely power packed. It is not enough to read this book once. I have personally read it more than 10 times and I make it a habit to read it every 6 months because there are so many lessons to learn and review. This book has changed my life and I am certain it has changed many others. It compiles many ideas from many other great thought leaders. It is concise and has many practical examples on how to improve your living. I have broken a lot of bad habits and developed a lot of good habits as a result. I am still working on improving me based on these concepts so it isn't something that happens overnight hence the reason I recommend to read over and over. I also read this to my daughter, hopefully she will pick up these lessons while young to make her life so much better. If I could only choose one self-development book, this would be it. It has got all the lessons to live a successful life in here.<br /><br />I have also given this book to others as Darren had recommend and I believe I have helped them to grow in greater ways. It may seem like a sales pitch and maybe it is, but I believe the value created for myself and others is there and I also believe Darren uses the money in a good way to help others and not for himself so I feel rest assured to support him.<br /><br />I also recommend his [[ASIN:B00696HSQI Living Your Best Year Ever]] as I think it works hand in hand with this book. I hope he writes another wonderful book in the future!
B00170GXWG|5.0|Excellent acting and a gripping story line will keep anybody with an interest in quasi-historical stories pretty well glued to the TV screen.
0545425115|4.0|I am not ordinarily an aficionado of young adult fiction and I realize that I'm a bit late to the party with this one but I wanted to read it with a fresh, unbiased perspective and evaluate it on its own merits. It helped that I haven't seen the film yet and going into it only knew the basic premise. I can say that it exceeded my expectations considerably.<br /><br />Dystopian fiction was once the domain of visionary writers like Huxley, Orwell, Bradbury, Burgess and many others. Philip K. Dick based almost an entire career on dystopia. In recent years, however, this banner seems to have been taken up by young adult writers, just as they have co-opted vampires and fantasy witchcraft. Being a young adult novel, the emphasis is obviously on teenaged characters trapped in a brutal environment where the daily struggle for survival is ratcheted up into a deadly kill-or-be-killed contest.<br /><br />The particular apocalypse that resulted in Panem, the Country Formerly Known as North America, is never specified and there is little explanation of the type of government that rules its citizens by a Big Brother style police state of surveillance and totalitarianism. It is enough to know that most of the citizens of the twelve districts i.e. anyone not living in the Capital are kept in a weakened, beaten down state of near starvation with the vicious annual hunger games the only opportunity for some lucky winner to bring temporary prosperity to his or her home district by killing virtually every other opponent in an arena of skill and survival in a wilderness environment tweaked and manipulated by the games controllers.<br /><br />The novel is a first person narrative of Katniss Everdeen, the literal breadwinner of her family that, since the death of her father in a coal mining accident five years earlier, consists of her, her little sister Primrose and their passive, traumatized mother. Taking the place of her sister in the Reaping, a lottery in which two `winners' from eachdistrict are chosen, Katniss finds herself paired with Peeta, a breadmaker's son who once lifted bread from his father's bakery to give to Katniss and her family.<br /><br />The games are a contrived national media event, like reality TV competitions such as `Survivor' and `Fear Factor' taken to their logical ruthless conclusion. PR people and stylists behind the scenes craft an image for the competitors. Peeta's public confession of love for Katniss gives them perfect material for a romantic story that will increase the public's interest.  Peeta doesn't have to act the part but the wary Katniss needs an acting coach, mostly in the person of a previous winner from her district, Haymitch Abernathy, a drunkard resting on his one claim to fame.<br /><br />Collins masterfully juggles action, conflict and tension to build forward momentum, resulting in a very high page-turning factor. The narrative conveyed through the point of view of Katniss is convincing enough to take the reader's mind off of possible weaknesses or inconsistencies in the construction of this society. I never quite understood why hunting was outlawed and yet so many people had to do it for survival while the peacekeepers generally look the other way. Also, I never got the sense that these adolescent warriors were capable of slaughtering each other. An uneasy juxtaposition between teenaged angst and killer instinct never reached `lord of the flies' levels. While Katniss herself is convincing and her ambivalence about killing another human is believable, I never quite accepted that any of these children were capable of taking this intense competition beyond the level of most real-world competitive sports.<br /><br />However, I have no problem understanding why this book (and its two successors, which I have yet to read) has been such a phenomenal popular success. While most adolescents are not thrust into life or death situations, all of them can relate to the pressures of competitons, helplessness atthe hands of authority and second guessing their own as well as their peers' motives. The novel effectively satirizes crafted public images and scenarios that the fickle public will buy. So called blood sports have become literal blood sports in this dystopia for our time.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Beautifully shot, lovely music, great acting.  If you like quirky comedies with one-line zingers, this is a great movie for you.
B0086449YA|5.0|If you like Knopfler,you will enjoy this double album.  He keeps gettig bettere and better.  we enjoy it the more we listen to it.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|LEGO Star Wars Super Star Destroyer 10221,This is a very good set, but you have to know!! The festival a great buy discount.very well.thanks!!!!!!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I downloaded the kindle version for my Microsoft Surface.  This book is a classic and is a must read for anyone who likes this story.  I had seen several versions of A Christmas Carol and/or Scrooge but I had never read the book until now.  It was well worth the time and I couldn't argue with the price for the download.  Get it.  You won't be disappointed.
B007PVHBHC|1.0|I have to go with the negative reviewers on this one.  Patti has fallen prey to the mediocrity and narcissism of so many aging rockers.<br /><br />Patti was enjoyable and relevant once, but this album is just so much boredom wrapped in a pensive rock wrapper.<br /><br />Skip it.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|We bought this for our Aprica Presto and it fits perfectly. It also folds relatively flat, if you need it to.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|didnt see to much difference in the unrated edition.  thought i would see some funny clips not in the regular movie.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|i'm not use to the kindle - with Ipad all you do is make the purchase and the app & icon appear ready to use already on your tablet - here you need to make the purchase and go somewhere within your apps library and then download . .. still cannot figure out where it is and have yet to be able to play the ad free version.  sent an email to amazon and never hear back.
B008V59AF2|5.0|good packaging cd was good also. songs were all good would recommend this cd to any one who likes peter gabriel.
B003VBNN7C|4.0|good movie for some mindless entertainment....not a serious movie, just a fun movie, cute story line...crazy dancing on the bar!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|love this movie.  the actors played in this movie fit the parts very well. great packaging . recommend this movie
B00006IM9Q|5.0|If you like, or think you like Blondie.... Grab this album. I had wanted to get a Blondie album for a while but just didn't get around to it; I finally have and I now know that Ive been missing out for a while.
B004GJYROG|5.0|greatest movie  for any one who likes cartoons and basket ball.  funny and great actors in this movie. good product for the money
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked this book because It had lots of twists and kept me guessing.  I would have given it 5 stars except that it would have been better had it ended sooner.  It kept dragging on and I began to get bored with it.  I wish the author had come up with an unexpected ending long before the one that became predictable by the time I got there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|From the first chapter I was  intrigued and wanted more, with a story so well written I was laughing,crying, curious, sad and  happy. The author does an amazing job of writing a unique story that encompasses so many raw emotions. Pats mental journey is so interesting and heartfelt....I just can't say enough good thing  about this book!
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great album. I highly suggest getting this music. It is the perfect companion to take along on a road trip
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Watching from the start (first season). Some say the second season is not so great but I enjoyed it as much as the first season. Enjoy I did.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The book The Dark Knight Rises was packaged well and arrived as ordered.  Reading for kids is always great and merits enjoyment.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|It's excitement from the start. Great story line. Graphics are supurb. Action all the way through, non stop. I really enjoyed the movie.  The acting was first class.
1419705849|5.0|The book Diary of a Wimpy Kid was packaged well and arrived as ordered.  The book is great and merits reading and enjoyment.
B009X01C64|4.0|This is a very nice product, but the price is a bit much for just a case. I guess if you want the Kindle to match business items, it would be worth it.
B0046W1692|5.0|The CD Arde el Cielo was packaged well and arrived as ordered.  Mana is always great and merits listening and enjoyment.
1400049628|5.0|Great book for anyone interested in the topic. My dad and brother both love this book. It's a good read and quite informative for when the zombie apocalypse happens!
B0015YIGJC|5.0|The CD Arde el Cielo was packaged well and arrived as ordered.  Mana is always great and merits listening and enjoyment.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Loved the movie and the humor! This will be a movie that will be watched over and over again by myself and my children.
B005FISBV2|3.0|We love Dexter and can't wait for season 7 to get released, but this was not our favorite season. Hope 7 brings it back around.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Very cute and intertaining movie! Love the graphics and the red hair! The brothers were very cute and cuddly.  Enjoyable!
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I found this book to reveal so much about the behaviour of myself and others that I feel more confident in dealing with others because of it. It's like a mystery has been revealed.<br />Exceptionally well compiled and researched.
B009B50QOU|3.0|I've been a huge fan of Green Day for a long time, and even stuck by them when American Idiot & 21st Century Breakdown came out and all the fans cried and called them 'sellouts' even though they were still making great music. This, on the other hand, was a bit disappointing - not a single song stuck with me in anyway. :( Hoping to hear better things in the future..
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Ordered this CD the same day I saw the movie. It's great. Anne Hathaway blows me away. I know it's actors singing vs singers performing but it is fantastic!! When I listen to this CD I feel like I am reliving the movie.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a huge Nelson DeMille fan - but I hated the Panther. The action did not start until the last 10-20 pages of the book. I hope he gets back to writing fast paced books from start to finish.
1401307450|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  My little sister (she's 22, I'm 37) was really into it and told me I should read it after her...she'd laid the book down for a few minutes, and I picked it up and began reading...I had to go order it before she could finish!
B007VTUYWW|5.0|With all the action adventure type movies presently showing today, it's always nice to watch a tried and true. This movie still excites, is visually appealing, has a wonderfully fun cast of characters (including Daniel Craig), and a story line that doesn't disappoint. Most certainly not a 'plenty gross' film that is filled with sex scenes and a constant display of  adult content. Instead, this movie depends on it's story line and it's wonderful cast of characters to keep a nice pace throughout the movie.<br /><br />Enjoyed watching it again.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I could absolutely watch MAGIC MIKE over and over!  Great job by all actors involved with an excellent story line:)
1451648537|5.0|This books is great! Walter Isaacson makes it an easy read but very informative and entertaining. The book is very balanced thanks to many great interviews with some very prominent figures in the tech industry and specifically at Apple. I have yet to finish the book, but now being half way through I thought I should write a review. Makes a good read for anyone that's interested in not only the life of Steve Jobs or the founding of Apple, but the story of the PC/Mac as well. Highly recommend this book to anybody!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My kids love there legos, everyday they come home from school they go get there legos and start playing with them.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie one of the best movies sence moses also played by Charlton Heston to me.<br />He is the greatest Actor of all time.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry is still Harry which makes the ending of this novel,so contrived that it ruins my appreciation for the novel all once it transpires...<br />Connelly starts out with a cold case that brings out all of Harry's skills and compassion. But while the killer(s) seem logical, they also are pretty stock characters -- maybe Connelly is more bored with this than he lets on...
B008XG1X18|1.0|I downloaded it and when I tried to use it I could not... It would ask for my password and when I put it in there it refused it saying it was wrong.. Tried to do this several times so finally I just deleted it all together.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Reacher can't seem to catch a break...<br />If this is how our nation's law enforcement agencies work in reality, we are in trouble...
0345803485|5.0|I wanted to start out this review by commenting on the 4,000 plus people who gave this book one star. Some mentioned, there is no way a 27 year old male could be a billionaire, know how to fly a helicopter and have had 15 sex slaves. Here is some news to you, there is possibility there is one or two people out there in this world who are 27 and billionaires, Have sex slaves, have their own companies, who are older than their years, and who can produce multiple orgasms for a virgin. Saying it doesn't exist is saying the air is filled with honey.<br /><br />This book is FICTION. FICTION is just a story concocted by an author with a vivid imagination. Is Harry Potter real? Twilight? NO, it's all made up mumbo jumbo put out there for our enjoyment. With that said.......<br /><br />I think this book is well written and a page turner. It's as if your being privy to a dark hidden secret, but the real basis of this book is not the S&M, but it's the romance, desire and sexual awakening of Christian and Ana. I think this is a great and entertaining book and I'm looking forward to reading the entire trilogy. If your a sexual prude, I would not recommend this book to you, but if you're one that likes a book that is so far off the beaten path, then this book is for you. Try a sample and download it to your Kindle, nook or iBook.
0425263908|4.0|One post listed all the similarities and even i didn't catch all of them. If you've read 50 recently, break  with them n hop on this series. There aren't as many repetitive sex bits (let's admit, 50 was 200 pg story, 300pg graphic and while i do enjoy me a good bit now n then i found myself skimming several bits) and has more depth and as a reader i felt more connected. I will be buying the 3rd in may.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed knows just how to pull you into this book and make you not want to get up until it's finished. Her raw energy about life experiences, with her wonderful way with words made this book absolutely worth all the hype I've heard. Thanks for sharing your story.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Have always enjoyed pac-man game but the game controls on a kindle really STINK!!! So you are better off playing this on a different device.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|If you want action, this bleeds it. No plot or silly story to get in the way, just a guy having a really bad day and everyone wants to beat him up. Using the bathroom? Beat up. Cooking? Omelet smack down. Sleep? Pillow fight!<br /><br />For those who crave action like a teen with ADD charged hormones this is your movie. For anyone expecting something other than superman face punches..... No.
B00012QM86|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies so I bought it and would say it's worth the buy.  Good quality.
B00005MP58|5.0|so love this movie! of course,colin firth is my favorite Darcy ever! I would recommend this one to anyone.plus made sure my mom got a copy.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|The concept is very innovative and new, I like the choice of cast as well. I have watched this movie a couple of times and I'll watch it again some time soon
0345529057|5.0|my husband loved these books and read them all to the end. Especially since he watches the series on tv which make the tv series have more sense now that he read them.
B0074QGGK6|3.0|Like a glass of unsweetened iced tea on a hot day, this book is refreshing and invigorating - a little shot of energy for when you are feeling lethargic.
1407130293|5.0|i looked this box set and have let other borrow them! Everyone i have let borrow them loves them. I also would recommend to people to read the book before seeing the movies!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|It's an exaggeration of the teenagers issues on the American society... the author tries to get you connected in some way to those issues but it's a failed attempt... I don't relate to any of the characters, especially to the main character who is a 15 year old boy who cries ALL the time and can't deal with his emotions: good and bad... kind of makes u want to kick him...
B0012GMVG2|4.0|I wanted the song Africa, so I bought the CD.  Turned out there are several other good songs on it too.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|We grew up with David Baker and the other Dr's. Got hooked again with Eccleston and are in love with Matt Smith. Now we've got my step kids addicted. It's wonderful to watch with them. (Like you can ever watch too much!)
B0041CGOZS|4.0|Some of the songs on this album are on my required list, so this is the logical choice to buy this album.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|We're all completely addicted to this show. My step kids are now on season 3 and are crushed that the series is ending.
1612191290|5.0|I already knew that I was interested in Dave Graeber's work when I bought Debt. I'd read a copy of Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology and it was really excellent as well. The main idea that I was attracted to in Debt is the idea that economies are not impersonal forces that can be calculated like the equations of a particle physicist, but rather that they are networks built by not necessarily rational human actors for the specific purposes of satisfying particular needs and wants. Satisfying the needs and wants of the moneyed classes in particular.    I was not prepared for the implications of this idea when fully fleshed out however. Some of the conclusions Graeber comes to are truly startling. There seems to be no good way to argue against them however, even if one were inclined to. An example of this can be seen in these very reviews as a matter of fact. Several of the more negative reviews posted for this book are derived from an incident that took place over the course of several blog posts on the Mises Institute, an Austrian Economics think tank[...], a heterodox branch of neo-classical economics that is often the basis for a variety of libertarian capitalist ideologies.    One of their fellows wrote an article condemning Graeber for his misunderstanding of economics, and their economic theories in particular. And of course, in all proper lynch mob mentality, several of the commentors there rushed over to Amazon to give Debt poor reviews. Of course, when all this was brought to the attention of Dr. Graeber, he posted a long and thoroughly devastating rebuke of the criticisms laid out in the original blog post. In his rebuke, he called out the original poster for not having even read his book, preferring the intellectually lazy and dishonest shortcut of basing his review of Debt on a few lines from an interview about the book. Dr. Graeber then went through and dismantled the Austrian argument point by point. There has been no response posted.    Debt undercuts all of your high school economics assumptions about how society has developed its commercial interactions and replaces them with a well thought out and well supported global history of human level interactions. Reading it leaves the reader open to new forms of thought, new forms of association, and as Dr. Graeber hopes towards the end of the book, open to more authentic forms of freedom.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|doesn't do a lot...makes noise, but does not light up much...unless someone is a huge Dr. Who fan (like the person I bought this for), then I would skip it
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I would highly recommend Wild to anyone who has spent significant time in the Wilderness. This book is a beautiful adventure that fully explains how nature can always put your perspective in place.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|And not just Southern Rock... Blackberry Smoke shifts gears from track to track to give you country rock, classic rock, blues rock... they just plain rock.  Their musicianship is awesome, from the harmonized guitars to the keyboards to the percussion, you will not be disappointed.  Lead singer Charlie Starr is an amazing talent who seems to have the combined souls of John Fogarty, Janis Joplin and Ray Charles amongst others and shows this wonderful versatility from song to song.  The vocal harmonies are outstanding as well.  Buy this CD as well as their others (Little Piece of Dixie CD is equally awesome) and you won't want to listen to much else!
B002Q1YDLI|1.0|This book was a nice read. Kept me wanting more!! Would love to read again. Love the characters hilarious but loving!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Almost seamless and plenty of options for any reader that downloads this app. Will not disappoint! A must try for sure.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Ultimately I liked the book; it was better than the last 2 offerings for sure.  However, it starts off incredibly slow.  You have to be willing to stick with it for quite some time before getting any payoff.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Like any other solitare game, I just play it when I have to use my tablet to play games.  Same old games.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Awesome as always.  Bravo George R.R. Martin!  Can not wait for the next book.  Hurry George, write like the wind!
