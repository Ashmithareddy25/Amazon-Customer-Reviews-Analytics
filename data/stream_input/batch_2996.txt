B009LDD1X0|5.0|In my opinion this is the funniest sitcom on the network to date.  Our family gathers around the TV each week to watch and on cold and rainy days we have the DVD's, we own the complete six seasons.  Good humor, quirky personalities and new smart comedy!!!

B003U0AHBO|5.0|I was surprised by the story line of this film, I was expecting a repeat of earlier Robin Hood films.  The story in this film is very different from earlier versions.  I like this movie however it has more adult content than the Errol Flynn or Kevin Costner Robin Hoods. Russell Crowe is outstanding as robin Hood.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I don't know what to not like about this movie other than they need to continue the series. It would be really cool if they took you through the campaigns via this show. Help you see where all the tricks from the game are located like the specialty guns. I'd watch it AND buy the videos, too.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I like action movies and this one has plenty of it.  There also a lot of comedy.  It is so hard to find a film that is fun to watch that isn't full of cursing and nudity.

B00C9QQBA6|4.0|I'm not a fan of long books, but sometimes things can be a bit too short. That being said, despite this books size, it is a quality story. I'm not an avid sci-fi reader, but I've been getting into it more. I like the mixture of historical pieces and sci-fi. Quite a creative work indeed.

B008Y212PI|5.0|The game can be as relaxing or as challenging as you like. Use the allowed hints...or not. You can always reset the game if you like, no harm done.  The 5x5 gameboards are fairly simple, but nice to do when you want to quickly play something for a short period of time. The larger gameboards provide much more of a challenge. Well worth the price for a surprisingly enjoyable game.

0385474547|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read....it was written with so much skills and insight of African culture, and what it entailed prior to colonial days. Chinua Achebe intertwined two worlds in this masterpiece, pre-colonial and colonial Eastern Nigeria.<br /><br />Appreciating this book now is better understood after reading it in high school.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|The first thing to say about Gravity is that it's a beautiful movie. It's beautiful in the same way that Life of Pi is, just spectacular to look at. What's even more impressive about that is that it's nearly all digital. It's pretty amazing. In fact, the movie, much in the way of the Star Wars prequels, was delayed due to waiting for the technology to get to a place where the environment could be made to look realistic. Well, I've never been to space, but it looked amazing. I'm not actually sure it's Oscar material, but I won't be surprised if it gets a nomination for best visual effects.<br /><br />The next thing that has to be said is Sandra Bullock was amazing. Even more so when you consider that she's the only character through much of the movie. The only other thing like this that I've really seen was the under-appreciated Moon with Sam Rockwell (seriously, you should see this movie). Most of acting is, in a sense, reacting, the interplay of characters (and actors) with each other. It's much more difficult when it's just... you. Nothing and no one to play off of. The dependency on monologues in Hamlet is one of the reasons it has long been considered to be the measure of success for actors. If you can pull off Hamlet (the character) believably, you can pretty much do anything. I think Bullock could pull off Hamlet. She carried the movie as if it was weightless. And, if it doesn't get nominated for anything else, Bullock certainly deserves a best actress nomination for this.<br /><br />However, I do have to say how very disappointed I am with Cuaron that Bullock was, basically, a default choice, because they couldn't get anyone else to take the park. The anyone elses, other than Angelina Jolie, all being \\"young, hot\\" actresses that, well, can't much act. Most of them. Basically, they wanted a pretty face for the role, a role which would require the actor to carry the movie, not someone who has proven she can do the job. That is... just disappointing. But I digress...<br /><br />The only negative I've seen about the movie has to do with Clooney and how Kowalski is such a flat character. As such, Clooney didn't do much acting. And that's true. Clooney was pretty affect-less, but I think that was intentional. He's not a real character; he's a representation of the person Dr. Stone sees him as. He's the strong leader that takes charge and isn't flustered by anything; at least, that's what he is to her, so that's, also, how we see him. So, yeah, the part didn't require much of Clooney, but I think it was perfect for the movie. He's so flat that we don't get attached to him, and that's required, because we, as the audience, are supposed to be focused completely on Dr. Stone.<br /><br />Here there be dragons... um, I mean spoilers... Here there be spoilers. You have been warned!<br /><br />As great as the movie is on the surface (and it is great just taken as what it is, a disaster movie in space), I think it's its deeper, metaphorical meaning that gives the movie greatness. After the disaster occurs, Kowalski needs to get Stone talking so as to distract her and calm her down, so he started asking her questions about home. We find out that, really, Stone has been leaving in space for a long time, since the death of her daughter through an unfortunate playground accident. The woman has no life. She goes to work, presumably doing something that relates to saving the lives of kids who have had similar accidents, although we never find that out, and, then, drives. Just drives. In silence. She has put herself as close as she can into a vacuum. Into a suicide-less death.<br /><br />The death of Kowalski puts the loss of her daughter into perspective. Stone is trying desperately to hold onto him, but he can see that her persistence is going to kill them both, so he entreats her to let go, just let go. And it's here that we can see the flatness of Kowalski best. He's stoically heroic. There is no clinging to life on his part, just pragmatism. \\"You have to let me go or we'll both die.\\" He is the sacrificing hero as seen through her eyes. \\"You have to let go.\\"<br /><br />Of course, this has a deeper meaning that applies more to the fact that she is still clinging to her daughter than it does to him.<br /><br />After that, she enters the space station and strips out of her space suit, and there is a lingering image of her curled, fetus-like, in front of a round window looking out at space. It is the exact image of the womb and of her entering into a state of rebirth.<br /><br />But it's not really that easy, because birth, as easy as it seems (to us in the USA, anyway) in this 21st century world, is not easy. And she almost gives up a little while later but has a lack-of-oxygen induced hallucination of Kowalski telling her that she has to make a decision: She has to decide to live. If she's not going to decide to live, she needs to quit living the lifeless life she's living and just get it over with. She switches the oxygen back on and chooses to live. Finally, she lets go of her daughter and says goodbye.<br /><br />The final scene of her crashing down and escaping the capsule as it floods and sinks, the scene of her climbing out of the water is the very metaphor of birth. She stands there on shaky legs (after being in a zero G environment) like a newborn colt and faces a new day. A day with the hope of life, not one that clings to death.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I loove this album. I am trying not to listen to it to death but good albums have that effect!<br /><br />It sounds like Follow the Leader mixed with Issues...and some elements of Untouchables and even has sounds/singing remenecant of The first debut album..I really love this album and lulluby for a Sadist is my fav and Prey for me and... God They're all good lol...but have to say, my least favorite is Tell me What you Want  ...just not really my style but the ending soubds like black metal or something from slipknot lol (people gonna love that )..<br /><br />overall,  I knew this album was going to deliver...And it did.  This Ladies and Gentleman just might be Korn's best album yet.. and I won't even argue with that. ..especially considering it was an emotional reunion with Head and all. GOD bless korn. They will always be the best Rock/Metal band that ever existed in my opinion.. Im ready for the 13th album already lol
B004OC07F8|3.0|Very good book for the curious reader but it really lacks the &#34;How to create&#34; part or at least laying down some basic framework for a new strategy.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|If you are an 'Alien' fan you might enjoy some insight to the crashed ship found by the crew at the start of 'Alien'. In the film we get to see who the giant spacemen were and how they got there. It's was an exciting film with an interesting plot that, to me, left room for some additional story. Of course, any good film like this will leave room for more; lets hope it comes.
1476729085|4.0|The cover of The Rosie Project proclaims it to be an \\"international bestseller,\\" and this comes as no surprise; it absolutely deserves to be. This book's got a lot going for it: a colorful cast, a scientific basis without getting too cerebral, a clueless protagonist you can't help but root for, and a healthy dose of humor.<br /><br />Don Tillman is a professor of genetics who knows that he's wired differently than other people but doesn't know how or why. His life is one big routine, complete with a whiteboard to plan his days and make the most of every minute. He prepares the same menu every week, memorizing recipes and accessing muscle memory to cook; this way, he has enough free brain space to problem solve work-related things while cooking. Why bother to use the brain power needed to try something new when his menu (and the rest of his life, for that matter) has been planned for optimal time and health benefits?<br /><br />However, as must happen for a book to be interesting, Don's life hits a speed bump: he decides that it would be beneficial for him to find a wife. (Married people are happier, live longer, etc., so Don deduces that he needs to find a spouse...you know, for purely scientific reasons.) Thus begins The Wife Project, a pages-long survey that Don designs to find the ideal mate: Do you smoke? Do you drink? What is your BMI? What do you do for fun? and so on. (He already knows which responses are acceptable and which are not, and he is having a hard time finding a woman that measures up to his sky-high standards.)<br /><br />Then Don meets Rosie. A fiery feminist who drinks, smokes, and tends bar (late nights? NOT healthy!), Rosie can never be Don's ideal partner. So why does he find himself wanting to spend so much time with her? His analytical mind cannot figure out the answer. And here the fun, comedy-of-errors shenanigans begin.<br /><br />This book is hilarious and heartbreaking all at the same time. Picturing Don walking up to a woman at a party and handing her a questionnaire cracked me up. But watching him miss out on social nuances, seeing him hurt without understanding why, really stabbed at me. Loneliness is always tough, but especially when you're not entirely sure what you're doing wrong. Even though (Do I really need to say \\"SPOILER ALERT\\" for this? I doubt it, but just in case...) Don's Aspergers takes his deviance to the nth degree, anyone who's ever failed in a social interaction will see himself in Don's struggles.<br /><br />All in all: Funny. Touching. A quick read that's worth picking up.<br /><br />Note: I received a free copy of this book via Goodreads's First Reads program.y and handing her a questionnaire cracked me up.

B00EMAGCJM|4.0|I am 39, usually only listen to R & B and hip hop, I have a 16 year old daughter, who loved watching Hanah Montana, but Miley caught my eye at the awards show, & her living life as she sees fit, don't give a darn what you think, I am rich b attitude, so I downloaded the album, & I must say I like it especially the first track, I Adore You.  I like her sound, really like many of the pop, songs with some hip hop guys thrown in.  This lady, and she is a grown woman knows what she is doing & I think she or who is guiding her is genius as the controversy she has stirred up got a guy like myself to pay attention to her who otherwise would not have paid any attention to her.  I think she should stick with this and see if it works for her.  One thing is for sure, Hanah Montana is gone, and I like Miley..
B005OLF6BI|2.0|I bought a used copy of this DVD/CD and it was in mint condition. Looks like it was played once and then sold. I can see why now. Watched it once and don't really want to see it again either. Oddly, no chapter select feature, just play all.
B002ZG975Q|2.0|The movie is a great one, the packaging was in good shape. The problem I have voiced my concerns to no avail, the movie skips so bad you can't watch it. It's not just a little here or there its the whole movie.

B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|EVERY song on this album is AMAZING! Listening to her music always puts me in a good mood. I've been listening to the entire album nonstop for about a week & it doesn't seem to ever get old. I was completely SPEECHLESS when I found out she is only 16 years old!!! She has such a beautiful, mature voice for her age. It's good to know that every young pop singer isn't a wannabe Miley Cyrus!
B0068FYZCA|5.0|I am a senior citizen and love to delve back into my days of the 60's.  I love the Beach Boys and the rest of the past hits.  Ron Howard does a great job in this movie.

B009PMEEY2|3.0|I don't usually go for games like this, but since it was the faotd I thought I'd try it. Although I ended up enjoying the game, I finished it in one evening. I can't imagine paying much for a game that's over that quick. I also can't find any replay value at all, so keeping it is pointless. In my opinion, three bucks is WAY too much for a game like this (done a million times, with just minor changes to look different), considering the short play time. Just because they add useless storylines that have absolutely nothing to do with the game, doesn't mean it's worth any more money.

B00E03ULJS|3.0|Top Three Songs:<br />- Live for the Night (with Cash Cash)<br />- Enjoy the Ride<br />- Dancing With The Devil (with Krewella, Patrick Stump, Travis Barker & Savoy)<br /><br />  Over the recent years of the rise of EDM the genre of merge of electro and dubstep has grown popular with EDM fans and those outside the EDM fan pool. The trio known as Krewella, composed of the two sister singers Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf and Kris \\"Rain Man\\" Trindl as the main producer. They have been around for a few years, but recently grown to fame with their EP Play Hard (2012) gaining huge success that climbed the dance charts and playing at concerts like Ultra and EDC which helped them win the 2012 International Dance Music Award for \\"Best Breakthrough Artist\\". Now they released their first full album, Get Wet (2013), which has been on the iTunes Top 10 Dance Charts for just the pre-order and now with it just being under Avicii True (2013).<br /><br />  Get Wet starts off with their first single \\"Live for the Night\\" with EDM group Cash Cash helping out with production. \\"Live for the Night\\" is a bumping, out of control, party track that has electronic, auto-tuned vocals with heavy growling basses and high pitch synths, but also has it soft moments with piano and a rocking breakdown part. \\"We Go Down\\" is another party electo/dubstep song with some hip-hop elements to add some \\"swag\\", but still have room for a drop. From their Play Hard Ep, \\"Come & Get It\\" is an out of control electro song that you can imagine a group of ravers just going insane to.  If you want a more inspirational song with good feelings and you can imagine yourself driving on a long road with the beach next to it without a care in the world then progressive house \\"Enjoy the Ride\\" is just the song to listen to. \\"We Are One\\" is a big room/electro house festival banger song that you, again, just can go crazy to. \\"Dancing with the Devil\\" the trio collaborates with Patrick Stump (from Fall Out Boy), Travis Barker (famous drummer), and Savoy (a live electro house trio) to make a dark and crazy dubstep song which does make you feel like you are dancing with the devil. \\"Alive\\" is the hit song from Krewella's Play Hard EP, with electro riffs, amazing vocals, and just another huge festival song. Going away from the whole party/festival theme of the album, the trio produces with SmarterChild (electro producer), to create a more heart-filled, fist pumping were you can just sing the lyrics \\"Pass the Love Around\\". \\"Ring of Fire\\" quickly goes back to the festival theme with co-producers, The Cataracts (hip-hop/synthpop band) and Candyland (house duo), with an electro/fidget house song with high pitch blips and fast pace beat that will make people go crazy. \\"Human\\" starts off with relaxing theme with an acoustic guitar and amazing vocals and lyrics, but breaks off into epic dubstep, but keeping the same emotional theme of the song. The last song from the trio's Play Hard EP, \\"Killing It\\" another rocking electo/dubstep song, which literary just kills everyone listening to it, but in a good way. The last song from the album is the collaboration with glitch hop/dubstep artist. Pegboard Nerds, called \\"This Is Not the End\\" and ends with a bang.<br /><br />  When I sit down to listen to album to see if it is good or not I look for a different number of things, here are some of the main things. One is sound quality, two is if I can listen to it repeatedly, three the message, and four the variety. If you can't already tell, I am not the biggest fan of this album. It's alright, but it doesn't impress me too much that I would go crazy over it. The album is almost just listening to a bunch of party songs, with inspirational lyrics, female vocals that are glitched, crazy electro riffs and synths, and banging drums. It just got a little repetitive when I listened to the album for the fourth or fifth time and each song almost blended together with a few breaks from the craziness with songs like \\"Pass the Love Around\\" and (sorta) \\"Enjoy the Ride\\". I am not saying that I did not enjoy any of these songs, for partying and going crazy it is perfect, and it did have some breaks from it, but not much. I can pick out most of these songs, like \\"Live For the Night\\" and \\"Ring of Fire\\", for a summer playlist or a party playlist, but that is all this album just really feels like to me, just partying and having a good time. I am not saying that is bad for a song or an EP, but for an album just gets old really quickly. If these were singles or three EP's then I would love it, but for me it was just another mainstream, electro house, pop-ish album. And when I say variety I don't just mean genres, you can hear some genres differences between the weird and craziness from \\"Dancing with the Devil\\" and festival bangers like \\"We Are One\\". What I mean is I hear almost the same drums in every song, the same blasting synths, and the vocals being glitched out of control. It just gets repetitive. If you are a fan of Krewella then you might be a little disappointed with it, if you like the party/festival theme of music then get it, but if you like variety and not-just crazy music then I could get a few songs you would like and leave it alone.

B008Y212PI|5.0|Simple Pleasures is an excellent game.  It is creative and gets better the bigger the puzzle.  Most are pretty simple, but there are a few that you have to guess instead of deducing.

B002GOAH1U|4.0|I bought this movie because I remembered enjoying it when it was new, and the kids have found it really fun. They'll plug it in to watch whenever they feel like it.
B00DYVUBYM|1.0|I rented this movie because of Emma Watson and the hype about Sophia Coppola. The movie was very slow and boring and the soundtrack was awful.<br /><br />It appears that Coppola got the script from 'The Bling Ring' article on Wikipedia while the actors ad libbed for some lousy dialogue. The characters lacked any kind of substance and the awful acting from all except the male lead and Leslie Mann made me uncomfortable. They portrayed pot-smoking, coke-sniffing druggies, yet didn't even know how to hold or smoke a cigarette.<br /><br />Emma Watson must have channelled Rachel Zoe and snorted pink bubbles in between scenes to play a caricature-style valley girl. Her American valley girl accent was cringeworthy.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Read 'The Bling Ring' article on Wikipedia. There. Now you've 'seen' the whole movie. Nothing more or less than that article was covered by this train wreck of a movie.
0061900664|5.0|I read this book over and over to my son when I was expecting my second child.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I dislike serifed fonts, and there is no way to change the font. You can change the size, but not the font itself. This is a huge limitation for me, and I only use this app as a last resort. (OTOH, I love my Kindle over any other dedicated e-reader.)
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|I loved this game until I got to world 3 level 1.  There seems to be a glitch in the game.  The level starts with Lep on a cactus that kills him before he can even move. I can't even start playing the level! So I would love the game again and give it 5 stars if you can fix it. Please fix!
B006BQM762|3.0|An OK sci-fi thriller, with the requisite bug from space, nasty military guardians of earth, concerned scientist, budding young love, very loud special effects. Good but not really that memorable.
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|Great acting. Awesome music. Made even better on high definition. Just enough extra features too. Sometimes blu-ray gets carried away with the extra; just my opinion.

B007PVHMCG|1.0|Very, very small.  Get the actual demensions of the box and you will see how small the item is.  my 10 year old played with it maybe 10 minutes on his birthday.  I was very disappointed in lego. they finally created a minecraft lego and this is what they came up with.

0544104404|4.0|I always believed there was something inside every one of us that did not reveal itself through grades or test scores.  My profession involves people from all walks of life who make mistakes or show an inability to adapt to societal norms.  I have often told other parents who brag about their kids or who have concerns about their future that - \\"All bets are off until they are 35 years old.\\"  This book explained and confirmed what I thought - that \\"book smarts\\" are  not the same as intelligence and that the key to success and happiness in life is self-respect and character.  You will not be happy unless you work hard at something you choose to do.  Academic failure is not tied to family income - but the character your family instills in you - or the lack thereof - can have severe consequences in your attempts to develop into a successful person.  This book explains the science behind why parents should be more focused on nurturing their children vice force feeding them rote information.  If you are a parent or an expected parent - read this book!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Did not think at first that I would like this game, never have been a fan of games on phones but once I started playing it I got addicted to it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was written by an adult, but it was still humorous and touching. I would read parts out loud to my husband. Really good.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This movie is horrible. What a little whiny sniveling entitled brat this half a man Jaden Smith is. Couldn't act his way out of a plastic bubble. If you see the movie you'll understand the reference. But I highly suggest you don't. Dumb dumb dumb. Bad CGI, bad acting, bad script and bad movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I understand that there needs to be conflict in order to drive the story. I understand that the protagonist needs to suffer so the reader will empathize. I understand that the antagonist need to be a real jerk so we hate him. But, there a point when an author can go too far. There's a point when that antagonist is too much of a jerk. There's a point when the protagonist suffers too much. When the author crosses this line it becomes a miserable experience for the reader.<br />The Mocking Jay crossed that line for me. As more and more characters that I cheered for throughout the first two books were killed off I found myself caring less and less for the remaining characters. I found myself becoming ambivalent to the outcome.<br />So why did I give it four stars? Because the journey, although ultimately disappointing, was enjoyable much of the time. The purpose of a good book is to escape reality for a little while, and much of this series was a very enjoyable. Suzanne Collins is a very talented writer whose characters contain real depth and emotion. That's why I gave it four stars.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|You can feel the build up to the dramatic climax. In this book, there are several new characters. Some of important and some just there. The way the author transitions from this book to the next is , well unconventional, but I liked it. Can't wait to start reading the next chapters
0060763280|5.0|This book was amazing! I hope others have a chance to read it. It will change their lives for the better.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast is cheap in price, simple to use, and streams in HD for crystal clear picture.<br />I was dubious at first having used the roku box and Apple TV-both of which are a pale comparison to the Chromecast. With some external programs you can stream anything from your computer or tablet/smartphone.<br />Love it. Add more programming and this will continue to get better.
B0089J270U|4.0|I enjoy a handful of old movies, this is one of them. Funny, but I don't think of this as a &#34;Marilyn Monroe&#34; movie even though she was in it....due to the fact the main characters are the Donahue Family (which include Ethel Merman & a young Donald O'Connor). It is a great musical and I enjoy watching it from time to time.

1401228801|5.0|Here we get Mr. Dark's sort of origin-of how he got caught at least! We get a nice break from the regular fables to focus on the days of old. Also It's Bufkin VS Baba Yaga and a Genie, That right there makes this a proud purchase! An unforgettable Battle!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It was definitely a different concept. A book written about a dogs point of view. I fell in love with a dog and cried like a baby at the end of the book.<br />I'll recommend this book to all my book loving friends
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Telling story of historical Jesus with well-gathered past research results by other scholars. Description of  Paul  is very interesting as I know now that he is one of the major contributors in  creation of the religion in addition to those who wrote or approved canons. Also, description of James, a brother of Jesus, is interesting as I can guess what historical Jesus emphasized in teaching before his death.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Very clean interface. Easy to set up and use. Ads aren't that much of a bother since you have to scroll to the end to see them. Tip: ads are on the last screen to the right, if you hate ads...don't go that far.
B00E66QPCG|5.0|I found this book to be very good, straight to the point, and exciting in the way of making you feel that this is accomplishable. I have read this and Mark's free download book, and I am pleased with the simplicity of detail. Whether you are a beginner day trader as I am or been doing this for some time I think you can benefit from this.<br /><br />The most important thing is that it helped me understand just how how to even create a day trading strategy.  This book is all that he says it is.

B00EY7MFKS|4.0|This show is just starting and it is showing great potential. More character development is sorely needed, but I'm sure that will happen as the season progresses. There are hints thrown in here and there about things that happened in the past with each character so hopefully they will expand on that. I love the humor and the dialogue between the characters.<br /><br />To the people who say the four and five star reviews must be from people who are paid to do so-grow up. Go to your favorite show where you left a five star review and you will see at least one person saying something similar about your review. Just because you don't like it does not mean it isn't good. Quit attacking people who have different tastes in shows and a different opinion.<br /><br />To the people asking why they have the show to buy here, more than likely it is because they want to be able to watch offline as well as the fact that it won't always be free. ABC will eventually remove the episodes, so your argument will be completely invalid. People-think before posting a review asking questions like this one. Seriously.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. Stop rating down shows because your stuff malfunctions or the quality isn't good. That is on Amazon and the people who make the products. Don't punish the show.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing story, well told and greatly illustrated through detail.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an intriguing tail of honor and valor among men.

B003G4W49C|5.0|My 13 year old daughter was assigned this book for school.  She usually does not like this type of book but enjoyed reading this book very much.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|That most of her family continued to feel her, see her, hear her, along with two childhood friends, was compelling real.  Could  she really be gone? The characters are all flawed , but with the exception of the murderer, all with many saving graces. Smaller part, but I particularly loved the Grandmother. That and for all that Susie lost, with we her watchful eyes and maturing thoughts, she wins back much in the end.  The writing  carries you along with beautifully composed descriptions, and a vivid imagination of heaven.  For all the anguish, there is much sweetness in this book, as well.
0811879542|5.0|Awesome awesome awesome!!!  This is definitely a book to buy for young children. When you read it to them do so with a lot of flair.  Really Hammid up as you turn the pages and make them guess what will happen next.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This was a great purchase. For the price, we have got a lot of use out of it. We use it for out 18 month son and his 2 year old cousin. Perfect size for them.

0446401307|4.0|Michael Connelly is one of my favorite authors. I've read 5 or 6 of his other books, including a couple without Harry Bosch. To me, this one is just as good as his other novels.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained about the book being too short. It is a short novel, coming in at about 270 pages. (I read the book in 2 days.) But so what if it's short. Would you rather a book that's a bit short but good, interesting and fast-moving OR a book that has 450 pages of which 100 are just fluff?<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. Is it Connelly's best? No, but if you like his style and his plot, you'll enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint, the ONLY drawback--and this may be a stretch--is I sometimes wish (especially in 'The Overlook') that MR. Connelly would occasionally throw in a little personal stuff. It's not a huge deal but I'd like to see just a touch of Harry Bosch as a person and not Harry Bosch--detective. The lack of 'personal connection' is the ONLY reason I'm giving this a 4 and not a 5.<br /><br />Other than that, a great piece of fiction and I will continue reading all of his novels. Michael Connelly is one of the best.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|Nephews loved it! Detail is awesome! I thought they would like the quad but they love the dune buggy alternate. Cool set!

B001NHNG64|3.0|not as good as book 1 but still enough to get me to try book 3.  I don't mind suspending disbelief for a story line but there were times in this story where I had trouble making the stretch.  let's hope 3 is better.
B00DVPN30A|3.0|This isn't an in depth review. I'm not an audiophile but truly enjoyed Mission Bell,one of my favorite albums. Unfortunately, this album does little for me. It just doesn't have the magic of Mission Bell, no songs that make me drop what I'm doing to follow the song, none that really make me tap my feet either. Don't get me wrong. This is an enjoyable album, just not one that I'll fondly remember like Mission Bell.
0446310786|4.0|It is no accident that this book remains popular after fifty years.  Harper Lee's famous work discusses two important times in our history: the significance of the Civil Rights movement told through the lens of the injustice of Depression Era Jim Crow laws.  Jem's search for justice mirrors the search for justice our country has sought since its founding.  Lee provocatively highlights injustice on many levels: between the young and the old, the black and the white, the rich and the poor.<br /><br />As an English teacher, I believe \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" provides us with an opportunity to open dialogue with students about justice, privilege and discrimination.  It gives us a chance to help students come to their own understandings about fairness in our country.  As a reader, I believe \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" tells a compelling story in an artful way that gets at the most basic reasons why we read: to be entertained, to think, to consider our values and belief systems.<br /><br />With this book, Harper Lee has done it all.  She has challenged a country with a history of injustice to become just.  She has led us through the coming of age experience.  She has entertained us.  She has introduced us to the words and ways of the South.  She has created a piece of literature that will forever have a place of importance in our country.<br /><br />Maybe she didn't teach me how to kill a mockingbird...she did so much more.
0312944926|3.0|In a book about cryptography you would expect the cast of characters to be largely geeks, dorks, and nerds. Not so in Brown's world. Like all of his heroes they are sophisticated, attractive, well dressed, well adjusted, impossibly successful people who, if they were real, would fill the rest of us with envy. It in fact, they are so likeable as to be despisable. I see this as a problem with most of the Dan Brown's books. He doesn't seem to understand the concept of a flawed hero. They are simply too perfect. It's not what we were all told that people actually want to read in our writing classes and workshops, but his books sell like hot cakes, so go figure. But this near-perfection of his heroes is something that I personally do not like about his work. How did all these computer geeks, academic types, and overworked managers get to be so perfect in every way? I don't think that one can be explained.<br /><br />So we move on to the story. It's hard to remember the details of it, since Dan Brown stories are littered with complications which arise on every page. Broadly, it concerns a cryptographic algorithm that, if the US National Security agency gets its way, can be manipulated to give them an exclusive view into all the world's digital communications. This infuriates the open source hacker community to no end, and infuriates foreign governments even more. It creates what begins as a bidding war, and ends as the life-and-death battle over their new encryption system.<br /><br />The story is certainly interesting, and littered chock-full with the digressions and red herrings that are Dan Brown's trademark. He certainly doesn't make it easy for his sympathetic characters. I think it's the only reason you have to sympathise with them. Whenever they begin to make progress, they get knocked back big time. You begin to feel sorry for these people, perfect as they are, never getting a break. It is not exactly life, but sometimes we all feel like that.<br /><br />Much has been made by other reviewers of the factual inaccuracies in this book. I admit many of them must have passed me by. Perhaps I was overwhelmed by the sheer implausibility of the plot that I missed the various details about mainframes, computer hardware, encryption algorithms, and whether you can destroy an entire facility by damaging the IT system's cooling mechanism, but in general I found the technological side of it to be a lot of fun and, myself having been an IT guy in the past, thought provoking.<br /><br />Many people know that Dan Brown is not a great writer. But he seems to give something that people want. I don't know what that is, and if I did I would try to bottle it. But whatever my complaints about his writing, I confess I enjoyed Digital Fortress. There's a lot of cool stuff in there, albeit some overly cool people posing alongside it. At least it's free from all the pretensions to reality that Angels and Demons and The da Vinci Code specialise in. Nobody is going to read this book and think, wow, all this stuff must be true!<br /><br />Reviewed by the author of [[ASIN:B01FVBEZ3U Send Him Victorious]].f the factual inaccuracies in this book.

They add new free puzzles all the time or you can pay a small fee to buy new puzzle which are usually in a theme bundle. If you like puzzles then this app is for you. Like with all apps it does mess up but if a reboot doesn't fix it then uninstall and reinstall will fix it and you just have to redownload the paid puzzles again for free.

0452273331|1.0|The Fountainhead is well written and I could understand someone finding it enjoyable. The people who regard it like the bible are very scary sociopaths. Very inhuman black and white characters that are not believable. At times the book just rants about individualism and elitism. I fully understand about thinking for yourself but in my opinion this books is way too polarizing and unrealistically portrays people. I think Ayn Rand could not understand people. She might have been artistic.

B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Though this album has only been out one day, I have listened to it at least three times.  If you are an avid Alter Bridge fan, then reviews about this album are moot.  If you are not an Alter Bridge fan, then this album will set a much different precedent then the previous three albums.  The sound has matured greatly over the past ten years, and has truly been captured on this album.  Musically, they take the melodies in twists and turns that I was not expecting, making for an adventure during my first listen of the album.  Myles Kennedy's vocal performance passionate and awe inspiring, with some remnant flavorings of his days with the Mayfield Four.  Mark Tremonti has more soul in the guitar solos and his vocals, than I have heard in any of his previous work.  Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips also deliver with a rhythmic section that drives the album each step of the way.  I worked in radio for over a decade, and have been exposed to heaps of bands and albums...this has separated itself from the fray, and is truly one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Reading through it, It's like reading through the entire Director's Commentary for the movie, with detailed sketches, artwork, and terrific nuggets about all the amazing details of the movie. This is one of the best &#34;art of the movie&#34; books that I've seen in a long time.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Some information and statistics are empirical but the author's conclusions are impressive. A remarkable contribution to anyone that wants a new shape and looks for a healthier and balanced diet.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|Yes, Superman Returns was really bad. But that's no excuse to turn Kal'El into THIS. \\"Long\\" and \\"loud\\" should not be the first descriptors used when discussing one of the finest comic characters ever to grace the silver screen, but one has few alternatives in this case. It's understandable that Zach Snyder would have no grasp of the character, because the mere concept of \\"character\\" is completely lost on this big budget video-game cut-scene director. Chris Nolan should know better, however, even if he lost his grasp on the Batman character more and more with each successive Dark Knight film.<br /><br />It was obvious things were going to be rough when during the early promotional appearances Snyder and company said they used the \\"Death of Superman\\" storyline as the inspiration for much of the film. Choosing to use the most universally reviled storyline in the Superman canon? Sure, why not? What could go wrong?<br /><br />Everything. Throughout the film Superman is a cipher, and the last hour plus of mayhem is antithetical to the character's entire purpose.<br /><br />Not to mention that this movie has some of the most dumbfoundingly stupid dialogue of all time. Examples (paraphrased because who gives a flying patoot):<br /><br />1) Zod: \\"There's only one way this ends: Either I die, or you die.\\" Actually, Zod old sport, that's *TWO* ways.<br /><br />2) Random Generic Female Villain: \\"We have an evolutionary advantage, because we have no morality. And as history has shown, evolution always wins.\\" Always wins WHAT? EVOLUTION?????<br /><br />3) Lois: \\"They say it's all downhill after the first kiss.\\" Superman: \\"I think that only applies if you're kissing a human.\\" So.... Clark is saying that he's going to get bored with Lois because she's human. Well, forget you too, buddy.<br /><br />This movie is start to finish a disaster. I hate to operate in hyberbolic absolutes, but if you disagree, even a little, you're wrong, and your opinions from here on out are moot.<br /><br />Also, Russell Crowe rides a dragon. Just 'cause.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is great for any relationship not just married couples!  Recently engaged and dated bout becoming a statistic of divorce, reading this has helped make me great relationship a million times better! Definitely recommended for anyone thinking about marriage!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game but I am very disappointed that it is not the same edition as apple product Dragonstory. You can trade, battle and do so much more with apples version. Why is this not available through you?
B00CLO3WSK|5.0|I can't believe this movie is 20 years old. Other than the fashion and music, the story is classic and watching it never gets old. Who doesn't love beautiful singing, great acting, and Whoopi?!

B003TJR2HS|1.0|Despite trying the other brand (Scosche), none of them worked.  I still didn't see any charge being applied to the IPOD Classic 30GB 5th Generation when I plugged it in between my cable and my IPOD in my 2009 G37 Sedan.<br /><br />I was greatly disappointed.  The reason why I purchased this item was because on the official listing of compatible IPOD's released by Infiniti, mine was listed as being compatible with the CableJive.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that listing was not accurate.  =(<br /><br />Perhaps early generations of the IPOD (4th Generation or below) may work.  This was purely based solely on my experience.<br /><br />Works great as an extension though, but in essence, overall it's just a pass-through connector.
B000IFSDZQ|5.0|Best purchase so far this year along with the bonus video and the booklet.  Love the bonus tracks and alternate tracks
B004SIP6QI|5.0|I found this movie to be one of the best written and directed for this particular subject that I have seen in a long time.  The acting was superb.  Jude Law was nominated for an Oscar and rightfully so.  He did an outstanding job in his role as Inman.  I was especially  pleased by Ren`ee Zellweger's acting.  The story following a man who must leave the woman he has fallen in love with to fight a war he does not want to be a part of speaks of that particular time in our history.  People who watch this movie as just entertainment do not understand that these things happened in the civil war.  Very young men were forced to fight and die for a cause they did not understand or believe in.  The progress of Inman after he decides to make his way back to Cold Mountain, North Carolina is at times riveting.  At home, Ada ( Kidman) must keep her hopes alive that Inman is still alive and will come home to her.  As the war turns what was once a comfortable lifestyle into poverty she is joined by a rather strange character ( Zellweger) who helps her bring the small farm back to life and made it possible to survive.  The added truth to this war of men who stayed behind to kill or enslave men who did not want to serve or as Inman did, leave there post as the war became an obvious lost cause was hard to watch.  How men could be so cruel and arrogant was disheartening.  The end left me very sad except for the one happy surprise at the very end.  I hope everyone who reads this review will purchase this movie and enjoy the gifted actors, writer and the excellant directing of Anthony Minghella.  I promise it will not be a waste of your time.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|why can't it cast more, such as watch espn.  I thought it would cast more from the iphone and ipad other than Netflix and such

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you liked the original Star Trek series and movies, you will like this one. This is not a next generation Star Trek. I liked the look of the original Khan played by Ricardo Montaban better than this modern day Khan version ( matrix looking).

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Love all the star wars movies. My cousin's introduced me to the variety of angry bird. Then oh $#&iexcl;T, things got real when you created angry birds star wars 1,2. I've really appreciated how this simple game ( They kick my @$$, but my 3year old cousin owns, so any time I can't I run to him for help) all the angry birds games  have helped in some of my pass time and have pacified all 8 of my younger cousin's.
1439190976|3.0|Duff McDonald gives a fair and neutral study of McKinsey.  Some of my takeaways from reading the book:<br /><br />McKinsey and Bower basically invented management consulting as a legitimate profession.  They are sincere and honest people with business integrity.  They believed in conducting exhaustive research for clients.<br /><br />Rajat Gupta is an extremely greedy, dishonest person.  He destroyed all the principles brought by Bower.  His supposed \\"charitable work\\" is just a shield for his morally corrupt self.<br /><br />CEOs use the likes of McKinsey for their own selfish purposes of either playing politics with their peers or wanted to do things but claim the idea comes from a \\"trusted authority\\"<br /><br />What I am most curious and furious is why aren't there more academics, journalists, and media calling out Management Consultants' bluff?  This whole profession is a sham line of work.
B004XWLN20|4.0|I started watching the series when it was first on TV. Since then I been catching reruns every so often and wanted to watch it again from start to finish. I found it here reasonably priced and couldn't resist.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|If you have 2 hours you are dying to waste then this is your movie. This is a Will Smith project and he personally hired M. Night Shyamalan to direct it. It is without a doubt the worst movie I can recall Smith in and the worst effort on Shyamalan's part also

B00E1ZIZ3O|5.0|This was a \\"must-buy\\" for me, as I've been a Peter Gabriel fan since he was with Genesis.  Each classic-period album he made was an event for me, and in retrospect I hear them as part of a cinematic \\"soundtrack of my life.\\"  Now, having been informed by everything that's happened musically since, from Talking Heads to Bon Iver, Arcade Fire and everyone else, the songs here simultaneously evoke memories of past eras and serve signposts to other corners of my musical mind.  Quite a wonderful experience!<br /><br />Everyone will have their favorites here, whether resulting from memories of the originals or admiration for the new interpreting artist.  The best part for me, though, is when the synergies of past and present create new pieces that are \\"greater than the sum of the parts.\\"  This happens several times here, but one notable example is Regina Spektor's cover of \\"Blood of Eden.\\"  I liked the song to begin with (it was on Gabriel's \\"US\\" album) and I've enjoyed Spektor's work on several albums, but this interpretation takes both the song and Regina to a new level.<br /><br />There are MANY other examples.  You'll find the same \\"synergy\\" magic happening over and over again in other songs here.<br /><br />If you like: A. Peter Gabriel, B.  Any of the artists here; C.  Great music; and/or any combination of the above, give this a try.  You won't be disappointed!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I love this app, I've used it for a while now, but the one time i have to log out, just to make sure no one reads my messages while I'm away, i come back and it won't pet me log back in, for days now.
B008MWBY6W|3.0|It's a bag and not much to it. You can put your DSLR with the lens attached to it. Not enough space to put anything in it. Great if you're looking for a bag on a road trip or you're going out hiking. All around okay.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of the most unpredictable story lines in have ever read! Amy and Nick put the fun in dysfunction all the way until the end!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|It is addicting and fun to play but need more info on how to play each level.  You also should not have to pay for extra features just to clear levels that are hard.  I hate waiting for lives to come back too long of a wait.  It also is different from the computer than on kindle fire i have the arrow help on computer but have to pay on kindle they should sync both not be different
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|So, I might be a little bias here...I mean, I do love a good sci-fi, master story telling, amazing visual effects, GIANT robots, GIANT monsters, Guillermo Del Toro, ACTION PACKED, being submerged into a film to the point of feeling like I'm right smack in the middle of it and best of all be able to share it with the ENTIRE family. What's that ? You too like these things, then this is the movie for you my friend. If for some amazing reason you missed it at the movies, DO NOT go on living without seeing this film. GDT manages to turn a basic concept of robots vs. monsters into a roller coaster ride where you find yourself wanting more and more. The 3D effects are LEGENDARY, the story telling is so well paced you never notice where the time went. The robots and monsters are soooo well designed I find it hard for anyone to top them any time soon...The performances are over the top, BUT, you shouldn't have it any other way considering the subject matter. I feel it just adds to the entire premise. This is one of those films that at first you think, well, that was a little weird or a little cheese or whatever, but goddang it fits sooo perfect in the film and it all makes sense. (Warning, repeating some of the lines in any other context other than the movie might get you punched in the face). All in all, for me, this was a long awaited film, and when I finally saw it for the first time, I couldn't believe it was actually happening. The cinematography is simply put second to none. And some of those scenes are like, WTF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Be prepared, after the first time you watch it, to feel like \\"What the hell did I just see !!!! ?\\" and wanting to watch it all over again....As with any other GDT film, plenty of scenes have a ton going on, so it's nice to be able to pause and rewind to take in the entire sequence...If you breathe, have kids, a wife, a girlfriend, boyfriend, grandparents that like movies I totally recommend this movie. My two cents says it's worth every penny... Think adventure film done right...
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I don't why this movie did badly in theathers, I thought Will & Jaden Smith where just great. The movie was awesome.
B00BRUPICM|3.0|I found the plot to be just a little to contrived.  Maybe it is the translation but it just did not seem to flow as well as it should.  Not a bad read though, better than a lot of the stuff that is currently available.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is one of those books that I really struggled to put down.  Very good read!  I am looking forward to reading some more of this author's books.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|EXCELLENT Album/CD ! A Must have for any Paul McCartney (Wings) Fans. Truly a great album by an Iconic legend.
B008Y212PI|5.0|really like this game.  makes you use your brain.  wish there were more free games like this.  my kids enjoy doing this game in the car on way to grandmas house
B00008YLV2|4.0|Awesome movie....stunning special effects and great action.  Much of the action is direct from the book of the same name very well done.  Actors are superb, nothing really bad to say about it at all.  If you like reality based or based on true story films, this is one of the best.  Would have gotten 5 stars had it been Blueray for the same price plus the behind the scenes was a little weak but interesting.  (I consider behind the scenes very big in the overall rating 5 star would be Lord of the Rings in behind the scenes).
B0002IVN9W|1.0|This is actually a pretty good album, however I had to return it due to quality issues. The sound engineering as well as the actual recording quality is atrocious. The record labels/studios absolutely must understand that there is a large segment of the music listening public that insists on sound quality...the ones who buy the high end gear for which to listen to uncompressed music on. I'm not sure whether this was an oversight, inexperience, or just that the studios think that the Mp3 generation has set a new (low) standard and so they can get away with it.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I play this game on my kindle fire and I'm very aggrivated that I hit upgrade now to get nowhere now I cant play how to fix this
B00190N4E4|5.0|I especially like the part where the British judge stood up of his own volition when Ghandhi was brought in.  I don't know if it was true or not but it made a good point.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I am not one for writing reviews, so a film has to effect me pretty strongly to do so. If you are GdT fan, there is nothing to dislike about this film. His stunning visuals, while not as fantastic as Pan's Labyrinth, are just as crisp and detailed in this film. Bonus, no subtitles. If there is one thing you can expect from GdT is stunning visuals and theatrics, even when simply presented.<br /><br />There is not a Guillermo del Toro film I have not seen, and this is in line with all his other action oriented films, perfectly executed and entertaining. As a rule, I multi-task while watching movies, this one stopped all other activity so I could completely focus on what was on the screen.<br /><br />Having read reviews that pointed out its implausible storyline, I'd like to point out... it's not meant to be plausible. It's meant to be entertaining. Apocalypse movies are only realistic if you are a doomsday prepper (and no disrespect if you are, but still)<br /><br />This film is what would have happened if Cloverfield, Real Steel, Transformers & Battleship melted together and became a hybrid... a perfect melding of human/fighting-robot, aliens, kicking a** and taking names. There was also a great storyline, not developed as fully as if it were a dramatic film, but you could still feel the tension, camaraderie, personal connections, etc. between the characters. I know that I will be watching this one over and over again... it is just fun to watch.<br /><br />All that being said... totally worth watching...more than once.
B002ZG98J6|4.0|Think it is a good movie for the family &  one I added to my collection.  One I will enjoy watching over and over
B00E3Q71WM|5.0|Whom ever claims this album is a bust is just plain deaf and brain dead. The quality of this album is stunning and YEARS ahead of it's time. From the very start this album soars into ANGEL OF DEATH, a stunning track with absolute thundering bass lines but also somewhat subtle vocals sometimes buried behind the sound effects. Then it jumps into the title track, an anthem with blistering guitars and extremely good vocal lines. The fourth track is \\"LEAVE THIS TOWN\\" about a somewhat overzealous sheriff, his daughter and involves a rather large handgun. \\"NO ONE TOLD HIM\\" and \\"MEXICAN BLOOD\\" are great examples of THIN LIZZY's more creative styles and again. watch out for that bass line. I temp anyone who buys this album to crank up the end of the last song \\"IT'S GETTING DANGEROUS\\" and listen to the edginess and perfection of ending a track and album. Keep in mind that this album is not for the faint of heart. It thunders with bass & unusually good drums, screams with dual lead guitars. Add in stunning vocals & lyrics and it adds up to an outstanding performance.
B008OHV5C8|5.0|I first started following The Bad Plus when I heard \\"1979 Semi-Finalist\\" from Give on Pandora. This album seems more cohesive and digestible then some of their earlier stuff, yet it's still mindblowingly creative. The use of electronic sounds in this album is not obtrusive in the slightest. Great album.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|This is such a disappointment. Not only is the picture quality terrible, the audio is so poor. Certainly not what I expected from the comments posted on Amazon prior to the release of the blu-ray.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|This app is not worth anything...Real simple and most of all thank God it was free because I would not pay for this the last page it has is just junk for you to buy...Please do not waste your time and money.
031250926X|5.0|Our 25 month old little girl has loved it since she was about 14 months old. She loves the interactive nature of the book. It was a gift to her and we loved it so much that we have given this book as a gift to few more kids since then. Price is as usual great on Amazon. So any parents of toddler should definitely get it and it makes for a great gift too.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Good cover to protect my Kindle Fire.  If I have anything negative to say, it's that it's starting to show wear in one spot, probably because I use the Kindle Fire so much.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I needed a respite from a stressful day and thought that a &#34;light&#34; movie with some of my favorite classic rock bands would be fun. It certainly was.<br /><br />I did not expect much of a plot, but was pleasantly surprised. Fellow entrepreneur battled to survive and won for years after buying a state of the art sound board, luring some no-named bands who rose to the top of the charts and money started to flow.<br /><br />Creativity captured flawlessly by talented sound techs brought in one star after the other. The studio, Sound City, thrived until the digital music revolution and plummeted.<br /><br />But wait! In comes David Grohl, drummer for Nirvana then Foo Fighters. Up from the ashes rose the nucleus of Sound City, a Neve 8028 sound board.<br /><br />Victory! A wonderfully entertaining and refreshing movie to one who has been on a mission to amass a better vinyl record collection than in my rockin' past and return to rich, pure sounds from the studio.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game! When played on the 10 frame it's a little challenging, but not at all frustrating! Great game to pass the time.
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|So, anything that keeps me reading past the 900th page, even if it was only sheer determination to finish it...has to rate at least a three.  Gregory Roberts has clearly made a bloody fortune on this book..probably because he stuffed it chock full of sex, violence, drugs, tall tales and pithy romantic ramblings.  Ugh!  Enough already.  But, that said, I stuck with it because it was despite all that mildly entertaining.  What would this guy think of next?  Escaped prison, saved an entire shanty town from sickness...walked on water?  Whatever.  If you have a couple of really long layovers coming up and need something to fill your time, read Shantaram (though it's a bit large for traveling).  Take the stories with a grain of salt.  Roberts is no Steinbeck, no martial arts hero, and no Clark Gable...but let's give him this much, he sure knows how to embellish a story.
0783232039|5.0|Hey it's the Living Dead Girl here. I changed my name for this movie review, I've been a lol busy, but me and my ex are now finished...but I got to keep The Crown jewel of my Living Dead Girl collection (remember weird dolls, not the company) and it really pissed him off 2, let's just say it's that scene in the movie where Tiffany brings the Bride doll...then throws rice in chuckys face before she says well I'm sure you 2 want to be alone....only he doesn't get anything, and I get the Academy award for Every way I'm getting back at my ex...I'd say this could be the movie about it, so let's start from the top! That scene I wrote is one of my favorites by the way along with the scene at the beginning with the unsolved case files; although I have a few suggestions for more case files; we got camp crystal lake right? Well then obviously they know Sleepaway Camp so Angela's Machete should've been next to it. Then we could have like a stake from Lost Boys before Chucky...you know cool stuff like that. The throat slitting of the cop was perfect! (Also I love this flick so much I wrote a story about it for Halloween. I don't like the stupid couple backstory however, I don't care, I don't...in fact I didn't even before the breakup....I thought they were stupid when I 1st saw the flick. I paid to see Bride of Chucky, not this stupid background story that nobody cares about. Besides they did that part perfectly in seed of chucky so what was the point in this one?
0321886518|5.0|I can not own enough copies of Shakespeare's complete and individual works.  This edition is well done.  I agree the pages are tissue thin, which is fine if you are not reading your Shakespeare to and sharing it with younger children.  If you are, go for an earlier version with the thick stock paper.  As for me, this book is a magnet.  I can spend hours pouring over the beautiful lyrical phrases.  I don't know if Shakespeare actually wrote Shakespeare, for some the jury is still out.  I do know I dearly love the works attributed to him and will forever enjoy them.  I believe every family should own a copy (and read) Shakespeare's complete works.
0767817664|5.0|Hey it's Sunnydale Girl, no it's not midnight-this is what I call my classic scary movies (it says this on my Killer Clowns Dvd) I've been talking about this one for like three days. And I think a lot of it is because my favorite character in the entire movie is Evil Dead...he's like the same character as Corey Feldman in Bordello of Blood. He was lonely outcast teenager who gets turned into a vampire, not these weird T2 Super-Killer vampires some people are expecting, and as I've said before Shut Up! That is Not what vampires are about; and that's why I have no interest in seeing the Re-make; cause that is exactly what they're trying to do....so next topic.....Love and Marriage---She actually makes a pretty good vampire....it's kind of that funny Judd Nelson Way too old to be in High school joke, plus Charlie seems more like he'd date someone more like Sissy Spaceck in Carrie, not someone old enough to be his mother....but I do like the cool club scene with that great song that fit So perfectly.....and I liked how she was like one of the Three Sister vampires Dracula always has (odd though that they always say sisters) But why did they have to kill off Evil Dead? He was a great vampire and they killed him off! They did that in Bordello of Blood with Corey---Why?  These vampires without souls aren't Always hurting people and that ---when you're looking at Evil Dead you're not looking at your friend you're looking at the thing that killed him....Shut Up! I've Never bought into that, cause for one thing, not only is that Not the case we're back to talking about those stupid T-2 Vampires again, I mean--yeah sometimes you get one like Luke, in the 1st episode of Buffy (who I did like, also as The Judge and as The Silence of The Lambs guy in Joe Dirt, but I just think that's a cool actor...so once again Enough! You broken records about these giant T-2 Vampires...they're my favorite monsters and they're supposed to be like outcasts!

0780626966|5.0|Hey, it's Sunnydale chick here! I wanted to make a review on this movie for Halloween (I'm having So much fun doing this for this year's Halloween!) 1st I gotta say something for all you Buffy fans; Okay it's not the Same address as Nancy's (I just found this out her house number being 1439....Buffys is 1630, I just checked that out, but with that bad breakup (known if you read my Bride of Chucky review) and Wedding plans to my Actual good guy...that can even throw The Scream Queen (another of my nicknames) off; My friend Jon The S*** case Cinema guy reviewed this....great review you should check them out, plus he's one of the reasons I do these reviews anyway; cause he liked what I said about them. So since it's a set, let's start from the top, now I grew up on these along with Chucky...and although I dont like Every one..I'll mention all that I do, but fair warning...the titles have blended together over the years. Part 1. FREDDYS background, and a pretty good spoof is the one from The Simpson's Treehouse of Horrors Groundskeeper Willy makes a great Freddy. Now it's Springwood, years after the parents of the town killed Freddy and we all know why...He enters the dreams of their teenagers and Nancy the 1st Scream Queen chick of the series is also like Sydney in Scream or me and my friends in Scary Movies. She kicks ass! While the rest of the teens in Springwood need to be re-reincarnated into ones that can stay awake for five minutes, and I like Johnny Depp, but I think the 50,000 gallons of blood coming out of his bed was rather funny...along with him barely listening to music to keep him awake(maybe he should've listened to Dream Warriors...you know if that wasn't a few movies ahead.) Plus the Freddy car at the end that shows that we're going to have a sequel....classic! Now part 2; not the Biggest fan; but then I don't REALLY know anyone who is; and Jon suggests just throwing this one out, not a bad tip. BUT I do like the Gory pool party scene (you're all my children now!) The weird melted nightmare, odd as it is....and The Chucky like Body swap he wants to have with that teen who can't act (really lets leave it at that, cause I know the rumours and ....this is more towards the movies...now I love these flicks, but that line Drew Barrymore says in Scream fits real well, then there's that 3rd one lead in on the bus....Classic! Now for Dream Warriors....I love this flick, in fact it's my favorite....but the music video ALONE, where Dokken saves the day with 80s rock, could also be the movie(check it out on Utube. Now this also has my FAVORITE Scream Queen of the series Alice...(Nancy's second) and this has my FAVORITE plotline of the entire series (besides A new nightmare) The teens in this flick all have a cool superpower, although Alice has to absorb them when they die. My friends think I can be a combo of Alice and Nancy) This also has the great song Anything, To Alice's fight scene (and is now me and my fiance song.) Love the Numbchucks, it's like she becomes Buffy. The only thing I have a problem with is that idiot mother to the blonde girl.....okay you know Freddys out there cause you had a part of his killing; so you're solution to moving on is to give your daughter sleeping pills; okay? But here's another take on that; it's saying that parents don't REALLY listen. Okay cool; I'm on a roll with these even in order; well I am The Scream Queen AND THAT I AM gonna brag about. The next one is the one where the teens are in the nut house, later Ginger Snaps 2 is reminiscent of. These kids all want a new life, one wants to be an actress, and this is probably my FAVORITE death in the flick....when Freddy is a Tv monster and grabs her with his arms and says Here you go, you're big break in tv! Before slamming her head into the screen. Okay the next one has another one of my favorite deaths....My friends love it 2 and I even do my own dance I made up when Breckin myers is high and Freddys dancing in the tv.There's a great Be like me videogame nightmare sequence and after they unplug the Nintendo (Cause this came out on the year) Freddy holds up his knives glove and you see he has buttons all along his glove. He grins and says Don't forget the Power Glove, SO much cooler then that movie The Wizard that was made just to promote the glove. Now for DREAM CHILD Nightmare on Elm street part 5. This might be the strangest plotline EVER....but I love it anyway! Freddy has a kid somewhere along the line which must link up with the 1st one. It's hard to figure out who it is, and everyone is assuming it's a son, but I figured he had a daughter the same way I guessed Billy Loomis in Scream; She's a bad ass who hates Freddy -ends up killing him and says the line I always remembered from the movie and can also go out to my ex; I remembered how you used to hold my hand; I DIDN'T LIKE IT THEN EITHER! Then she slowly and PAINFULLY breaks his hand before she kills him; now you think this is the end of the series, but it wasn't, cause now we have A NEW NIGHTMARE. There's Heather Langencamp and Wes Craven...years have passed since they made the 1st movie and this is supposed to be the last one...(cause I'm thinking at the time it was) Now that's the background story....then we find out Freddys coming to get Nancy, after her ugly son (it's Gage from pet cemetery, love the movie, love him as Gage, but he's still ugly) has this book of Grimm Fairytales, Heather (who soon turns into Nancy wonders why he reads them; then she notices they are suddenly talking about Freddy with the jump rope theme and a picture of them. SHE FREAKS OUT, and has to go in her Nightmares...it's a little tricky but here we see her place in California that turns into her house in Springwood, and how she looked in the 1st movie with an old street sign that says ELM ST. And we have my favorite line in the entire series, but this isn't Elm Street...then Freddy says Silly Girl; Every town has an Elm Street! And surprisingly even after everything that's happened thru all the flicks, Nancy dies. Maybe it's like Stu says in Scream, Now ya gotta die, those are the rules. OR maybe it's like I say...if You're The Bad ass in the movie you can live thru out them, take your pick either way it's NOT how Sydney says it in Scream, because Scary Movies DON'T create psychos, they make us Outcasts more creative...it's one of the reasons I'm such a great writer, and even after all these years of watching Scary Movies...I've grown up; and think Scary Movies are even more Bad Ass! Hoped you liked my review, glad to bring back some spooky memories, and of course....Happy Halloween, and remember; Every town has an Elm Street!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a good book.<br />Loved the plot and how it kept you guessing with what was next. Definitely would read it again.
B002SSBD6W|4.0|I recently finished the book \\"Eating Animals,\\" by Johnathan Safran Foer.  Before I go any further I'd like to state for the record that I am not a vegetarian.  I approached this book as someone who eats meat and enjoys eating meat.  After finishing reading it, I would say that I'm not convinced enough by the arguments of the author to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle, but will certainly give thought to reducing the amount of meat that is part of my diet.<br /><br />While I liked the general tenor of the book, I found its overall structure rather disjointed and hared to follow.  I think the reason for this is that Foer tries to do too much with the book and ends up not doing enough.  This stems in large part from Foer's desire to be as accommodating as possible to his carnivorously inclined readers.<br /><br />Another contributing factor to this is Foer's bringing in to the book elements of the origins of our meat eating habits.  These to me, are the weakest part of the book for he fails to address these questions in any depth.  He often introduces one of these subjects only to almost immediately veer off into another discussion on factory farming and meat production.  More detail on the cultural aspects of our meat eating habits would be very welcome.  As well a more structured look at the relationships between us and the animals we eat would make the book better.<br /><br />To his credit Foer is very sensitive to the people that he meets along the way, whether they be part of the factory farm, food producing movement, adamantly opposed to it, or caught somewhere in-between.  The stories these individuals tell enable the reader to get a real strong sense of the many nuances that are involved in the production and consumption of meat products.<br /><br />When I speak of nuance, I am referring to the raising and slaughtering of meat that is done outside of the factory farm process.  There is no nuance within that world.  If there is one thing Foer's book makes clear time and time again, it is that our current way of mass-producing meat for consumer consumption is barbaric to the nth degree.  It is not only barbaric in the way that the animals are treated in the slaughter process, but also in the way it affects the mental state of those who are involved in the production of the meat.<br /><br />So now the hard part, change.  There is no doubt that Foer is right when he says that the only reason we don't eat less meat is that we are unwilling to.  Yet, I love eating meat, especially when I can get it cheap.  Nonetheless, I think that over the next couple of months I'm going to try and make an effort to add at least a couple of meatless days to my eating habits.  It's only a small start, but if we multiplied small starts by hundreds of millions of people, maybe we could bring our meat eating habits under control a little, and help remove a little cruelty out of our world.  Perhaps I even need to include Boon Burger as a destination when I go out to eat.  I've been there once and it was terrific.and time again, it is that our current way of mass-producing meat for consumer consumption is barbaric to the nth degree.

B0000844I8|2.0|Few films leave me feeling as dumb as `Stargate' does.  What is really funny about this film is that even as a young kid, who was obsessed with all things science fiction and action centered, I was bored to tears by this overwrought yet surprisingly underdeveloped mess.  Some films try way too hard to think everything through that they wind up making absolutely no sense, and `Stargate' falls into that line.  Considering that the acting and actual storyline fail to be anything close to compelling (Jaye Davidson in his second and last film role again steals the show, but to a lesser effect), the film winds up being nothing more than an exercise in visual effects and over the top costume design.  In that instance, it works (eye candy to the extreme), but at the end of the day this is a forgettable flick and a complete bafflement to me.  How on earth did this garner such a large fan base?
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Enjoy playing this game on my Kindle Fire.  Wish you could earn extra coins. Or cheaper hints to help you advance.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|The main characters tore at my heart strings. I laughed, I cried and I was touched by the romance. Loved this book and would definitely recommend it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love is app because it have guns and if u rate this app u get more guns that's cool
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I have loved this book for a while. Recently reread it and still love it and I'm excited to read the other books in the series because that were not out before.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|This app is very pretty. The layouts are nice and the content is simple to read and enough for a weather app.<br /><br />The app uses GPS to locate where you are. Personally, I don't like to share fine GPS coordinates because that can tell the developer where you live. I disabled the auto locate, and the app still tried using my GPS. Unfortunately, that is not acceptable. If it's a .99 cent app and doesn't unnecessarily use GPS it would be an easy 5 star in my opinion.
B000M02M2M|2.0|I agree with the reviewer who expressed disappointment after reading so many good reviews. The crayons broke quite easily and I don't see the difference with less expensive crayons, except the really bad $1 ones. Should've saved my money.
0307949508|4.0|More intrigue - better than the 1st and I'm anxious to read the third in the &#34;Trilogy&#34;.  I had to force myself to put it down.  Understand though, it takes a great deal of &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34;.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|First of all I have to say I absolutely love the crossfire series. But this book not so much. Was kinda disappointed. The first two I couldn't put down this one was kinda hard to get through. Too much detail about things that just didn't matter. And then there was the abrupt ending. Very disappointed in that. Sylvia can do much better. Don't know what happened with this book. I will be waiting for the next one hope she steps it up a few notches with that one.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I would really recommend this documentary to everyone.  What we eat certainly does make a difference in our health and wellbeing.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I've always been a big fan of these type of movies, out of the past few years this movie along with Brave and Hotel Transylvania have been up on my top picks. I could watch these over and over again.
B003L77GG0|4.0|Awesome ending to an amazing series! The actual finale episode might not have been all I expected, but the season as a whole was fun, and funny, and had just the right amount of quirky for me!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game cause now there is servers now and it is a game that u just use your imaginations and build what u want. It's just like the pc but on a tablet! MY USERNAME IS RECALLINGDUST SO IF U SEE ME SAY HI!!!!!!!
B00EO10M54|1.0|Madonna wanna be. If all of you 15 yr olds did your homework it's clear everything miley has been doing and wearing has all been influenced by Madonna even her hair. Miley's stylist was smart enough to go after the less known looks of Madonna from 1986-87. I listened to the album and Wrecking Ball is about the only good song on it the rest are typical pop songs that have zero substance. Miley is talented and hopefully she'll REALLY grow up in time and be a real artist but I guess that will happen when she makes enough $$$$$ and has had enough attention.
B003VANOFY|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2KYHYFYSAC9GG]]If you are watching the video and reading this I am sorry that I am speaking so fast. This is because with the 100mb cap I had to squeeze as much information into the video as possible while keeping a very tight time frame.<br /><br />As a owner of many different headsets such as the Bose qc 15 and some other headsets I would say these are probably the most reliable one I have used yet. I love logitech products and have own many starting from my first mouse and I have to say this is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) The logitech G930 are really rugged headphones which have survived my occasional throwing around when raging in a game<br />2) They boast some of the best microphone qualities I have heard making my voice clear and surrounding noises such as a fan inaudible.<br />3) They have great sound quality, honestly they are not the best compared to other $300 headsets but they can easily beat any gaming headsets of its class<br />4) The G930's wireless is amazing where near the end of the range the quality barely drops at all and I could listen to my musics while i'm doing something in another room<br />5) They are very good for long usage, I have sometimes sat playing games or listening to music for hours on end and I barely notice my headphones at all.<br /><br />Cons: Though I have a few cons, I do not believe they really effect my ratings cause honestly they are opinions and also depends on the users ability<br />1) The cushions (To me) are a bit stiff making them a bit hard to get comfortable to unless I have it at a certain angle<br />2) At the beginning the wireless is a bit sketchy but after looking at blogs and restarting my wireless usb It instantly got fixed<br /><br />Overall they are amazing and for the low price it comes in I honestly would put this at number 1 for any use. It is a pity though they don't have headphone/microphone jacks but overall with such product online I would consider it a steal.<br /><br />*PS I don't know whats the problem with connections issues, since I have had the wireless receiver replaces 2-3 times I find no problem at all it just takes some time and research in order to find the problem.
1476727651|5.0|Being a forever fan of Mr. King I was quite surprised by the quality of this book.  Defiantly one of his all time best.  That is saying a lot as he has written some very fine material.  I read this book in two sittings and was almost sad when it was over.  I find it hard to believe that \\"The Shinning\\" was published over 35 years ago.  My wife read it in preparation for Doctor Sleep and thought it was wonderful.  I think it is necessary to read to fully appreciate Doctor Sleep.  This is a great book.  Thank you,  Mr. King

B002WV5A9G|5.0|Almost surprised at how much I loved this movie! Rented it to please the man, ended up on the edge of my seat myself.  Great to see the beginnings of beloved characters, made a bit more complicated and believable for the contemporary audience. Still smiling about Simon Pegg's Scotty.  One small complaint:  couldn't there have been better dialog for Nemoy?!?  Or maybe that was just the right touch to remind us of where this all started.  Definitely an entertaining movie filled with people you care about -- and just enough future science-y stuff to make you feel like it could all just about happen... ;-)
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was a good story. Not quite up to snuff with his other stories though. I did feel that the end left a little to be desired.
B000654YRY|5.0|This is a great DVD of Dire Straight's concert. I've had the CD for years, so it was a real treat to see the group perform when I knew the concert so well. The sound and video were excellent. Great Buy!
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great movie for my 6 and 7 year old grandchildren. I saw this a long time ago and thought the nice robot would be appropriate for them instead of all the blood and graphic violence in other movies.
1476727651|4.0|Any list of the top horror novels must include Stephen King's The Shining.  It was a book that I read as a teenager and it scared me enough that I had to sleep with a night light for a while.  That was The Shining - creeping madness and horror that left you weak in the knees.  Doctor Sleep is not really a sequel to The Shining as much as it is the story of Danny Torrance after he survived the Overlook Hotel.  It is a very different book in many respects but it stands on its own merits as a great paranormal thriller.<br />We first learn of Dan's struggles with the bottle.  He ends up fighting the same demon that haunted his father.  His mother has passed away from cancer and he's lost contact with Dick Halloran.  While running from another drunken fiasco, he happens upon a small town in New Hampshire and sees his old friend Tony in the window of a house.  By luck, fate or whatever, he makes friends and settles into a normal life including staying sober.  Then suddenly he starts being telepathically contacted by a little girl named Abra.  It is when Abra gets older and learns of a murderous group called The True Knot that the two of them join forces.  The Knot are a group who survive by feeding on \\"steam\\" which is the psychic essence of children who shine.  They inhale the essence and it is most potent when the children are suffering so they torture and then kill the child to get the best steam.  Dan and Abra join up with others to try and keep Abra from becoming their next victim and to put a stop to them entirely.<br />I liked the first half of the book.  It felt kind of like reminiscing with an old friend to find out what happened to Dan Torrance, Wendy and Dick Halloran. Abra's life and her family's attempts to deal with her strong shining was also interesting.  It wasn't until about half way through that the book really took off, though.  Once the True Knot become aware of Abra and she contacts Dan for help, it's pretty much a wild ride until the finish.<br />Asalways, King creates memorable characters, both the evil and the good kind.  He also crafts a story that's not just a scary thrill ride but also contains strong human elements related to our end of life journey and learning to accept our past without letting it define us.<br />I would say don't go into this book expecting the same level of horror as The Shining.  Start it like starting a completely new novel and then let Dr. Sleep take you on a ride.  It's a great ride but it's not the same ride you got from The Shining.  I hope that Stephen King will continue giving us his constant readers much more to enjoy in years to come.  And, if you're listening, Mr. King, do you have any updates for us on Stu Redman and the folks from Boulder?  That would be a nice follow up.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Great sound and built quality, highly recommended! It's a little big for portable use, for home use is perfect. A must buy!
B00DZAWPNM|4.0|I liked this CD much more than I anticipated. I'm actually an MCR girl but have bought a few PATD records in the past that were ok. I think this one is my favorite. I liked A Fever You Can't Sweat Out but it gets repetitious. I also liked Pretty. Odd. It was very different and I found it relaxing. I think this is my favorite of their records though, it had that slightly punk/emo feel...it's gloomy at times, but the songs are catchy and don't sound all the same. Very nice.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I have been a fan of Supernatural for as long as I have been watching it lol I didn't start it when it first came out. Probably not until almost the third season. I know have Seasons 1-8 on DVD. Absolutely love the show.

I bought all of the animals from the $1 bins at the bullseye store. When I pulled out the farm set for our home-preschool farm unit I quickly realized I was missing a few essential animals. I quickly went to amazon and order everything we needed, all Schleich of course. This piglet was no different than any other Schleich. Excellent quality, durable, long lasting, realistic, and educational.
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Listen, this movie is not high art. The physics are SO broken, the acting is often over the top, the tropes are overdone, and there's no reason smart people should love this movie. That said, every nerd I know, including myself, love this movie... because it's about GIANT ROBOTS FIGHTING GIANT MONSTERS. Ridiculousness ensues. And GDT doesn't expect you to fall for it as possible, he just wants you to enjoy that level of ridiculous.<br /><br />This movie features a ragtag crew of scrappy underdogs defending humanity against crazy interdimensional monsters, a plot to close the dimension breach using a lot of nukes, adorable-yet-deadly Japanese girl, firm-yet-caring father figures, bad boys strutting their mad skillz, a cute dog, government doing stupid things, and an altogether appropriate soundtrack-- seriously what is there not to love here? Have I mentioned the GIANT INTERDIMENSIONAL TENTACLE MONSTERS? Pacific Rim could have been made more realistic, sure, but why ruin a good thing?<br /><br />In conclusion, GIANT. ACID-SPITTING. MONSTERS. Being hit in the face with cruise ships wielded by enormous mechs driven by two brain-linked pilots. Some other stuff happens. Repeat the fighting. Nothing has been this epic since Abe Lincoln had a horse thrown at him and then rode that horse away. Settle in with a beer and a bucket of popcorn, turn the volume up and watch with a friend or three. I rest my case.

There is only one song we skip because it is not kid appropriate (in my opinion at least). I would recommend this movie to anyone, and the price I got it for was amazing. I ended up buying 2 copies for the price of one in a store or other website. Plus, there was not any damage to the DVD, and it arrived quickly.
0440237688|4.0|This story is from the perspective of an eleven year old young man named Jonas. Jonas lives in a type of society that has eliminated many sorrows of today's world. In this world there is no hatred, fear, pain, or war- could you imagine? This society that Jonas lives in is based in the future and is the \\"perfect society\\" so to speak. In this society, everyone looks the same, which takes out quite a bit of hatred in the society. At the start of each child's life, they are placed into something called a \\"nurturing center\\" for their first year of life, with other newborns. These newborns are born to people referred to as birthmothers, who never see their babies. After that first year, the newborns are adopted by an adult couple, by the choice of the governmental controlling power, and only one boy and one girl is permitted, per family. Any type of flaw that a newborn has throughout it's nurturing stage, or indiscretion that a person commits within the society, \\"releases them\\" or in today's terms, they are killed off, this is all in the hopes of creating the perfect society.<br />This novel portrays a society that is entirely controlled, there are loudspeakers that transmit orders to the community. At the age of 11, children are told what their job will be, after observation and begin training at age 12. The controlling power also chooses their inhabitants spouse and children for them. Any type of rule breaking within the community, and that rule-breaker will be \\"released\\" (a.k.a killed).<br />This is a book that I had to read for a college course I am enrolled in, and honestly, I did not think I would like this book after reading a synopsis of it online. If you enjoy science-fiction book or movies, this would be a great read for you. However, I have never really bought into the whole \\"syfy\\" thing. But, as this book went on I found it to be interesting and really thought outside of the norm, which I found thought-provoking. I found it to be relatable to the idea that someone is always watching, like the government is always watching your every move to see if they have to \\"release\\" you for breaking rules. It was a little eery to know that throughout the book, the governmental control is watching every citizen's every move.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Like some other reviewers I sometime find it difficult to completely suspend my disbelief or sustain my belief that the characters and their offspring continue to interact with each other separated through the years and physical distances, but it I still find myself caring for and about the characters. The historical back ground is also engaging and thoughtful especially in our current times.

B00FPH6M82|1.0|Okay so if you want to watch Will Smith yell at his kid then this is your movie. I love sci-fi stuff and this was probably one of the biggest duds I have ever seen. It was just another Hollywood Name Dazzler with Will Smith and M. Night Shalamalamdingdong. Trust me don't watch it.

At some point it will click and you will love it like something you can't live without, like a new flavor bewitching your brain. You'll listen until you're sick of it, then you'll give it a rest, and you'll listen some more. This album will be a part of you, like it is for me.
B007REV4T8|5.0|One of the best James Bond films made. This one is a must see. Action packed movie. Great performances from the entire cast.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I bought it when it was 99 cents. It took me a couple of days to finish, so great game for the price.
B007N579X6|5.0|I just finished watching this movie with my kids and we<br />all enjoyed it immensely. The animation and voice acting<br />was excellent as were the 3D effects. I fully recommend this<br />movie for family viewing. Also, the seller was excellent, getting<br />the movie to me in 2 days.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie. It looked really good in 3D. It was worth the money and it didn't take long to download the digital copy from iTunes which shows great as well.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a really fun and intense game. I really enjoy the variety and challenges. I would definitely recommend this game to all Mahjong lover's.
0316255580|5.0|My kid is 1.5 years old and she loves this book. She loves dogs and it's hard to find a book with just pictures of them. She definitely recognizes that these are dogs, even though some of them are hard to see well. Lots of great pictures. This probably wouldn't be a good book for kids that are still ripping pages though, at least without supervision, the pages are pretty averagely thick

B00E3IZIM0|4.0|This was a must see movie for me; well before 2013 started, and it took quite awhile for me to see it. Now that I have watched Pacific Rim, here is my review.<br /><br />Pacific Rim stars Charlie Hunnam as Raleigh, Charlie Day playing Dr. Newton Geiszler, Ron Perlman giving a likable performance as Hannibal Chau, Diego Klattenhoff as Raleigh's brother Yancy Rinko Kikuchi as Mako, and finally Idris Elba as Staker Pentecost. Idris Elba gave a notably fine performance in the movie. I do feel Rinko Kikuchi's character Mako felt...out of place at times,  but with a movie this good, it is not that big of a deal.<br /><br />As I expected, some began comparing this to Transformers, Godzilla, etc. And yes, there are giant robots fighting giant monsters(creatures), but Pacific Rim stands on its own two feet as a movie. There are some cheesy moments( a few of which actually still made me laugh). But there is an alarming, sure sense of determination and focus that makes Pacific Rim one of those movies that is not only action packed, and butt kicking, it still packs a even harder punch in terms of leadership and trust.<br /><br />I like a lot of things in Pacific Rim. Obviously, it is very easy to admire the visual effects. But with that, I love how Pacific Rim pays attention to detail. Its one of those movies you not only want to watch in 3D at a theater, you want the 3D experience of Pacific Rim in your home. Pacific Rim does contain some flaws, but it is a fun movie that reminds all of us why summer is one of the best times of the year for cinema. I rate Pacific Rim:<br /><br />8.2/10

B007GE2H3G|5.0|I've been reading the Tintin stories in  French, English, Spanish and German for 40 years.  I love the characters that Herge has created for his Tintin. Captain Haddock, Madame Castafiore, Struppi The detectives Thomson and Tompson and noyt to forget Professor Tournosol.  I liked the animation in the movie, but I didn't think they got Tintin's voice just right.  But a lot of fun to watch my favorite Comic Book character come to &#34;Life&#34;
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is the first real game I've played on my PS3 (the only other thing being FFXIV). I picked this up at a retailer for $20 and while two of the three games are easily forgettable, Flower and Flow, Journey is, itself, almost worth $20.<br /><br />First, Flow (or flOw as it's written), this is a simple test of the controller gyroscope. You play as a small organism that eats others to evolve, some can eat you as well. Once you've gotten through enough 'levels', you evolve into a new species and start again. There's not much to it, it is much like Official Wii Zapper with Link's Crossbow Training, it serves as a test the waters with the gyroscope. The music within the game is quite nice.<br /><br />Flower is much like Flow, but there is a small bit of story. You're reliving the memory of, you guessed it, a flower and how it came to be in the sad state it is in now in an apartment dull with grey, black and white. As you play each level, you pick up other flower petals as you fly on the find. Depending on how many 'secret flowers' you find (there are 3 per level), the flower in that drab apartment starts coming to life again and some color is restored to the world. It's a beautiful looking game, but has little substance (again, it's mainly a test of the gyroscope).<br /><br />Journey is the meat of the package, you play as a mysterious figure and your only real goal is to reach a mountain in the distance. There are no vocals besides some singing your character can do and when you encounter others online you don't know who they are, this is the point of Journey, to make you feel alone. As you reach monoliths, you'll meditate and see a mysterious being who could be God or maybe a mentor, this is left to the player (i.e. you). Graphically, it's beautiful, but the story is all up to you and how you perceive it.<br /><br />Pay attention to the small details in Journey, like sand movement and when it's on your cloak, I was blown away by that.<br /><br />All these bundled together, it's worth the $20 it costs.ther, it's worth the $20 it costs.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|At long last, Brian 'Head' Welch has returned to one of the most influential (and at times under appreciated) rock bands of the modern age. Korn's 1994 debut single-handedly created an entire sub-genre of metal that paved the way for many great bands to emerge in their wake. For almost twenty years, Korn has persevered where others have simply vanished into obscurity.    After Head's departure I continued to give the band's efforts a listen, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't somewhat underwhelmed. The way Munky and Head played off each other is what made the previous Korn albums such a delight to listen to. Even though Munky's solo endeavors were impressive, it just wasn't the same.    David leaving the group and experimenting with dubstep only seemed to put off more fans of Korn's original and groundbreaking sound that established the band as a powerhouse in the 90's and early 2000's. So...does 'The Paradigm Shift' live up to the hype? Is it a good Korn album? Is it a good album, period? I can assure you friends, the answer is yes. This album is a deliberate and passionate love letter to long-time Korn fans that can also be greatly appreciated by the newer generations of listeners. To put it simply, they just freaking nailed it.    I had originally planned to give an in-depth review of every track on the record, but after listening to it six times back to back...I've come to the conclusion that this is just an all-around great album. Heavy, haunting, and everything a Korn fan could ask for. If you're a long-time listener and are still on the fence, I urge you to give this album a chance. You won't regret it.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|At first I was getting kind of bored as the story unfolded, but once I got into it, I really loved it. The actors did a superb job and the cinematics and effects were excellent. I highly recommend it.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|As a HUGE fan of director Alfonzo Cuaron (HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, which I consider the best film of the series; CHILDREN OF MEN, one of the best films of the last decade), I'd been looking forward to his outer space drama GRAVITY since it was announced. Of course, word of mouth from its film festival premieres was so incredibly good that it seemed like it couldn't possibly live up to this hype, right?<br /><br />Short answer: YES IT DOES.<br /><br />Synopsizing the film doesn't do it justice, but it follows astronauts Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a first-timer in space, and Matt Kowalski, a smooth-talking chatterbox veteran who are forced to do whatever they can to survive together after a freak shower of debris destroys their shuttle in the most hostile environment that humankind has ever visited: outer space.<br /><br />That's really it. The film unfolds in real time, and thanks to Cuaron's vision and the talents of Bullock and Clooney and all of the technical staff, GRAVITY is not only the best film of 2013 so far (and will likely remain so), it's also the most visually immersive and absorbing film I may have ever seen in my 36 years of remembering seeing films. At a brisk but unrelentingly intense 90 minutes, GRAVITY grabs you and it NEVER lets go. The script by Cuaron and his son Jonas isn't just filled with dialogue and action that gets you from one moment to another. It has surprises, and a significant amount of heart as it becomes slowly less about just survival and more about living life.<br /><br />What really does it though, and this might be where the film might suffer on home video, is the ASTONISHING use of 3D. As opposed to 99.9999% of films that are shown in 3D nowadays, which is just a shoddy post-conversion so that the studio might squeeze a few more bucks out of the moviegoer, Cuaron actually USES the 3D as part of his visual storytelling. There are moments where you literally put your hands in front of your face in order to block the oncoming debris or whatever danger you might otherwise see coming at you. This speaks more to the immersive feeling of the film than just about anything else other than the storyline, performances, cinematography, effects and musical score by Steven Price... because all of these things are incredibly well-done. Bullock EASILY gives the performance of her career here, and Clooney does a brilliant job at keeping things grounded.<br /><br />GRAVITY is not a very subtle film, and it's not designed to be. There aren't layers upon layers of commentary like CHILDREN OF MEN, and there aren't subversive elements like in PRISONER OF AZKABAN. This is cinematic storytelling without the veneer of having to be high-minded. It's pure cinema that will terrify you, exhilarate you, and absorb you like no other film in recent memory. It's a great artist that knows when to cast aside pretense that isn't necessary and just tell a breathtaking story. Cuaron is one of those rare artists, and GRAVITY is one of those very rare films.block the oncoming debris or whatever danger you might otherwise see coming at you.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had multiple twists and turns that eventually ended up in a neat wrap up. I will miss reading about these characters but at least I know where their lives end up....the ones who survive.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I was waiting forever for this set to come out!  And it was completely worth the wait!  I love that you can set up the delorean in either style of the 3 movies (I prefer the original!) and the instructions are pretty simple !
B001PQERDO|5.0|This particular copy of \\"The Bride Wore Black\\" was selected because it said that \\"English -Dolby\\" was one of the spoken languages.  It seems as though that is wrong.  English subtitles only with this version.  But, English subtitles are better than none like on the Region 1 version I already owned.  This one was Region 2 and Amazon tried mightily to tell me that ... but, I wanted to test my new Multi-Region + Blu-ray player.  And ... the Multi-Region player worked as advertised !!!  So ... Region-2 and PAL now play on my TV's here in the US !<br /><br />Even if you don't have a version that has English subtitles, the movie still works for me !  This is one HOT movie !
B00AF82WTO|4.0|I like the emotions shown by the characters in this movie. The older version does not show the change of emotions as well.  I have not read the book so I don't know which portrayal of the story is accurate.  There are noticeable differences in the story in the two movies.

0767020308|4.0|Jane Austin has an intriguing way of telling a story.  There is romance with out sex which is seldom seen in movies today.  This is a movie you want to see twice.  By watching it twice you will pick up on the subtle clues in the story that were not revealed until the end.

B005LAIIGM|5.0|It's been an awfully long time since an honest-to-goodness science fiction film, one that doesn't involve robot monsters, aliens, comic book heroes, or the like, has been made in Hollywood; but it seems like we have one in the form of Mexican-born director Alfonso Cuaron's hour-and-a-half opus GRAVITY.<br /><br />Probably about as original and realistic a film as one could be that is set in the vastness of space, even if it is just above the Earth's atmosphere, that Hollywood has made after films like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, MAROONED, and APOLLO 13, films that it resembles quite strikingly at times, GRAVITY stars Sandra Bullock and George Clooney as astronauts doing a routine repair job on the Hubble Space Telescope who find themselves in the middle of a crisis when a huge debris field, created by the accidental missile hit on a Russian satellite, destroys both the space shuttle and the telescope itself, and the remaining shuttle crew.  The horrifying incident leaves the two of them stranded some 300 miles above the Earth's surface, with only their spacesuits for protection against the airless and soundless vacuum of the void.<br /><br />Their only hope for survival is to reach the International Space Station.  The trouble is, however, that the debris field caused by the satellite explosion has created a chain effect of other satellites and space platforms being destroyed in orbit, creating a massive swath of debris that keeps hurtling at them at thousands of miles per hour.  And some of that debris has indeed destroyed the I.S.S., and killed most of the crew.  Clooney sacrifices himself in order to get Bullock into the remaining Soyuz escape pod still attached to the I.S.S.; but again, complications arise.  Only after a hair-raising, eye-popping dilemma does Bullock get into the pod and head for the nearby Chinese space station, which itself has suffered tremendous damage.  Bullock, understandably in a huge panic, has only a limited amount of time before she gets into the Chinese escape pod and survives the intense heat of re-entry, not to mention another debris field created by the Chinese space station as it re-enters the atmosphere.<br /><br />Whether seen in the regular wide screen format, in 3-D, or in the specialized IMAX 3-D (where it would share a further comparison with the 1987 IMAX documentary about the space shuttle program, THE DREAM IS ALIVE), GRAVITY succeeds as great science fiction; and while it is at times overwhelmed with the 3-D process and the avalanche of special CGI effects (though the budget stayed at under $80 million), the effects don't overshadow the storyline or the characters, which is a marked and refreshing contrast from most Hollywood big-budget spectacles of the 21st century.  Cuaron co-wrote the screenplay with his son Jonas; and although some of the situations don't conform so much to the reality of space as they do to a slightly clichéd Hollywood version of it (something that Stanley Kubrick avoided extremely successfully in \\"2001\\"), overall the end result is a film that has a lot of the grace of \\"2001\\", the extreme tension of MAROONED, and the high-stakes terror of APOLLO 13, films that it can stand up to comparison quite well.  Clooney and Bullock (the latter especially so, since she must carry most of the movie on her own in a way she's not had to do since, probably, SPEED in 1994) give very solid performances here.  And perhaps as a nod to APOLLO 13, Cuaron cast Ed Harris, who portrayed NASA flight director Gene Kranz in that movie, as the off-screen voice of Mission Control here.<br /><br />The final result in GRAVITY is one of the best science fiction movies of recent years, and clearly a film to be relished as one of the best for 2013.

B00DJZR46G|5.0|Reviews about this album seem to be polarized. With multiple listens under my belt, I have come to enjoy \\"The Diving Board\\" in its entirety. Several newspaper reviews didn't like the album. Several people reviewing on Amazon also didn't like the album. For you people that do not like this album, I just have one question; What do you want from Elton John? Elton and crew have come up with a beautiful, piano laden, album. That is what all of the reviews for this album should be based on. Is there a \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\" on \\"The Diving Board\\"? No! But, there isn't supposed to be. A song like that would be very out of place. This album from start to finish is a piano album. People are also commenting on Elton's age and being relevant. Elton John always was and will be relevant! The problem with all of the negative reviews out there is that \\"The Diving Board\\" didn't live up to someone's personal expectations of Elton John. Elton isn't a robot. He doesn't have to sing about and write songs about only what you want him to do. If you can keep an open mind about this album, you will enjoy it thoroughly.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I was late to the game in reading this book, but I am glad I did. Mr. Coelho's writing is wonderful. It brings you along on the fantasy while giving you enough room to create your own images. But most importantly, it encourages you to pursue your destiny, even when views of what that is change as you go through life. It is a living fable, meaning you can see yourself and your friends in it, and apply the principles. Enjoy life, keep searching.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I put off reading this final book in the Sookie Stackhouse series, primarily because I read through several other very unhappy reviews. But I finally have succumbed, and am glad I did.<br /><br />I've been a Sookie fan since the beginning of the series, way before True Blood (which is pretty awesome in its own way, even as it strays far afield from Ms. Harris's vision of the story arc). It has been awhile since I read this last book's immediate predecessor, so it took me awhile to remember some of the relevant plot points (and separate them out from the True Blood versions of events in my mind), but I felt that I was up to speed pretty quickly with the characters and who had done what to and with whom earlier in the series, using clues and hints judiciously placed by the author.<br /><br />I'm not really sure why other readers have been so disparaging of this book as a wrap-up of the entire series. Perhaps (SPOILER) they wanted Sookie to end up with Eric? Or Bill? (that has been a non-starter for several books now, don't forget!) To be turned? To end up in Faery? To ... what? get bitten and become a Were? I don't know, but for myself, being a happily-ever-after kind of reader in general, I think Ms. Harris wraps everything up pretty neatly and hopefully. I won't say more about the end, but I do encourage you to read this final book with an open mind, and give Sookie the positive send-off she deserves.
B000003T9B|5.0|I've always thought back in the eighties that Overkill deserved to be among the \\"big\\" thrash bands. Today I am sure that they are well ahead of all thrash bands including the \\"big 4\\". This is their debut album, oftenly cause them to get criticised to have sounded like Maiden (which I agree, I was into maiden big time when I first heard this back in '85 and I remember first thing I'd thought was oh this sounds like Maiden, but better!!) In my opinion the resemblence is mostly because of Powerslave album where Maiden mostly used similar song structure with this one where riffs which were strong, catchy, and long kept playing throughout the whole song instead of structuring the songs with several different parts. Vocals, as well as being much better and versatile than BD, also have some likeness with him. But overall this is speed/thrash metal and at its best, so pretty different stuff than Maiden's. Much better too. This one (together with their second, Taking Over) is raw. All songs in this one are in my opinion just perfect examples of the genre. They produced very fine music in the following years, The years of Decay is one of my all time favourites, but this one, because of its raw perfection, is IMO THE Overkill album.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|All of the above refer to the ultimate Queen of show business reinvention ...Cher!<br />This CD is the perfect showcase for the Master of Illusion, containing both intense rhythmic dance music and ballads that showcase Cher's unique vocal qualities.<br />Standouts for me are Woman's World, My Love and the single ballad I Hope You Find It.<br />A #1 dance chart hit at age 67? And the Beat Goes On.....
B00DJZR46G|2.0|I love Elton, but this album joins The Big Picture at the bottom of the pile of modern-day Elton.<br /><br />This album is full of mid-tempo ballads. And nothing else. I loved The Union last time out, and before that, Peachtree Road and Songs from the West Coast. Even the Captain and the Kid tops this outing, and that wasn't top-shelf, either. Nothing wrong with mid-tempo ballads, but c'mon Elton, mix it up once in awhile. Throw in a toe-tapper or country-inflected song, anything to add some needed variety.<br /><br />Elton's public feud with Madonna is far more entertaining than this album.

Rip each onto your iPod and let the box collect dust next to all your other CDs.<br /><br />The Doors have an interesting (and unique) body of work. If you like their hits, you'll enjoy their album tracks. Their music holds up well, and the recording quality is stellar considering the timeframe. The price as of Feb 2017 is only $24. Why pay $15 for a greatest hits comp when you can have all 6 full albums for just a few bucks more?

B008220BLG|5.0|This was a fun movie and I really enjoyed it and the premise it was putting out there.  You get the idea of the entire movie if you watch a single trailer, in case you haven’t though, I’m not going to spoil anything.  It is your standard premise of zombies vs humanity, of course since it is a movie, both sides are exceptionally good looking even when they are not supposed to be.  The scenes are pretty text book but if you have picked out this sort of story you expect it to go the way it does before you even sit down to play it.  There are about an equal number of funny scenes to the tender ones and for the most part nothing to crazy horror-ish to freak the kiddes out.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|(NO SPOILERS) I think, what makes this book challenging, is about mid-way in the book, the story starts being told by two speakers: the main character, and the state of N Korea, through its direct agents and state loudspeakers.<br /><br />Once you unwind the two stories (which is not hard, because I am usually terrible at these things, and I figured it out), you become submerged in the \\"REAL\\" story versus the propaganda.<br /><br />Then, in the agents of the state, you also have two stories. The actual story of what they do, versus their internal story of how they justify what they do.<br /><br />I believe that some reviewers here struggle a bit, when the story (when warped and told by the state, often quite comically), becomes a character itself in the novel. Once you realize what an innovative and clever plot technique this is, you begin to relish the intertwined tales (truth vs not-truth). Which is, of course, a metaphor for life in such despotic regimes.<br /><br />Now, I'm a lowly engineer and no literature major, and so this way of telling a story was simply surprising to me, and deeply affecting. This is a meaty book, so you can't do it like a beach read, but it is an incredible story, and a novel whose memories will stick with you. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Life is fragile and uncertain.  How does an intellectual deal with this,  create a narrative for his life ?<br />PhDs, especially in the hard sciences from big name universities are often saddled with the life-long burden of needing to live the life of the mind- the intellectual, to have unique insights that no one else in the world has had, to see the big picture of humanity as only a feeble part of the great wonder of Nature.<br />But then we are forced to live in this world, where most other people are incurious about what we seem to care about, instead mostly concerned about making money, maneuvering  for power - all to head to Costco at the end of the day, only to buy that 2 gallons of virgin olive oil or that 100 inch Flat TV newly on sale there.<br />How do we get through this meaninglessness? How do we decide on the 'noble' course of action?<br />And how do you get through, if you have just been diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 50, there is an unplanned pregnancy, and you are a very overqualified high school chemistry teacher?<br />Walter Hartwell White does work that eventually leads to a Nobel Prize at CalTech. he founds a company but then drops out to teach high school, unappreciated by his students, and washing cars to make ends meet, for his family, especially his wife who doesnt seem to get him either.<br />of course, we all know that he puts his knowledge of science of chemistry to cooking the best crystal meth -<br />This setting seems unlikely, but results in the greatest TV show I have ever seen, combining great drama, social insight, suspense and even comedy.<br />And even as the captivating end comes, we agree with him that he didnt do it 'for his family' but for himself ' he enjoyed it, he was good at it, and it 'made me feel alive'.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green writes a piece so fantastic that one would be willing to trade their position with Hazel and Gus, just for their relief.
B008JFUO36|1.0|This flick is one GIANT cliché, with obvious, or should I say Oblivious, borrowing from past sci-fi flicks, many of them starring...TOM CRUISE!  I can always count on Tom Cruise 1.running fast 2.riding fast on a motorcycle. 3.fighting against the MAN and somehow winning in the end AND getting THE girl.<br /><br />The computer in his house on the table is from Minority Report, the helicopter in the canyon fighting drones is Star Wars Episode IV, His wife injured in the desert from The English Patient, the library scenes from War of the Worlds, sand people from Star Wars IV, Tom Cruise running fast from...well, every Tom Cruise movie ever starring Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Do we really need another (supposed) blockbuster film starring bigname actors such as Morgan Freeman and TOM CRUISE that succeed only in stuffing more cash in producers' and actors' pockets but leave the rest of us unwashed/moviewatchers wishing we had spent the evening shelling peas instead?
B00DDU1T5E|1.0|This app did not work for me. It caused my mac to hang where I had to do a force quit . I deleted it from my mMac. I also deleted the VLC REMOTE app which is required to use this app. I'm never installing this again. The only thing I kept was the VLC app to play files that Quicktime can't handle. Maybe you will have better luck.

B00000099X|5.0|One of my favorite albums. Delivered quickly, came in good packaging. Plays nicely, no scratches. I gave it to my husband for an anniversary gift, he listens to it all the time.
B00846REIS|3.0|Um,  I don't know.  In reading reviews for other books,  Gideon 's name would come up in those reviews,  so I decided to read Bared to you.  I knew going in to this book how close to Fifty Shades ( which I loved!!!, read the 3 books,  2 times), Bared to you was going to be,  but wow,  at times it was hard to remember I wasn't reading Fifty,  the stories are that similar.  I haven't decided yet if I am going to read the remaining 2 books.  It was a good read.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is a favorite so when I loaned it out and it didn't make it back I shopped for a new one. I was looking for one that was like new and was able to find it in excellent shape.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved The Shinning when I was 16 and now that I am 51 Dr. Sleep was the perfect sequel. I have spent countless hours with Steven, Tabitha king and their son Joe Hill entertaining me with imaginative stories some of which have scared me so much that the lights were left on while I tried to sleep. Some of the stories have made me think thru some of my own actions and why I have done some things. I have laughed and cried cheered and wept through the years. Thank you Steven King for another wonderful book.

B009NH6AOQ|4.0|This season was a good continuation of a very intense show.  Interesting though how now the survival of the group is based on finding themselves pitted against other people, rather than &#34;walkers&#34;.  Sort of Lord of the Flies approach.  We love the show and the plot, etc., but don't really believe the killing of the walkers always needs to be so graphic to get the point across.

B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Will Smith has been an actor that has delivered some entertainment over the years. Now though his focus appears to be the promotion of his kid as a viable major player in the role of the central figure, which he is simply not equipped to execute at this point in his young career. He was obnoxious in The Day the Earth Stood Still but cute at times, then in The Karate Kid he was totally unbelievable as he was a \\"fly weight\\" fighting middle and heavy weights and of course he was winning which was absolutely unbelievable. Then we are shown this kid in After Earth who again is just not mature enough to be credible in the roles his Daddy is creating for him, as he obviously has the assets and the clout to do as he pleases as a Producer, although he hasn't shown good judgment in the nurturing of Jaden Smiths career, which I think is going to really do more harm than good in the end because I think there are a majority of audiences that feel that this kid really just isn't ready for \\"Prime Time\\" as his presence simply isn't credible in the roles his daddy is essentially buying him forcing into a role that he is simply not ready for. And I am certain this is going to do this young man far more harm than good in the end. Producers, other than daddy, are going to repel at the idea of casting this kid after seeing the result of his (\\"lackluster\\" would be far to complementary of his performance as compared to what he actually delivered) downright silly performance in After Earth as the one sent to do battle with the creatures and hostile environment that his daddy would be challenged in an attempt at overcoming that type of sheer brutal challenge that he would be faced with, but we see the shinny kid out there tearing up all challengers that he is faced with, although totally unbelievable in a story that would have done well to add a Tin Man, Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion to make it somewhat more believable. But money has its privilege and Will Smith has plenty of that, the only problem is that money just can't buy Jaden \\"Talent\\" or \\"Credibility\\" at this point in his young life, no matter who his parents are.roblem is that money just can't buy Jaden \\"Talent\\" or \\"Credibility\\" at this point in his young life, no matter who his parents are.
B002LB13SE|3.0|Ok movie, I thought it was much better than the original (which I bought by accident in the bargain bin at Walmart). It does have the rape scene, which is horrible, but not too graphic. And, the ending....yep!
B008Y212PI|3.0|Ok,  nice and you can make it as easy as you want but if you don't  belong to facebook you are bribrd to leave an opinion to move forward.  t
B00ID4I6LA|4.0|I was not happy with the ending of the book to start with. I was hoping the movie could do better but went from bad to worse. I liked the way the book started with Ender as a six year old, the movie jumped to fast with a stupid end. The acting was very good I must say. I say rent it and if you like buy. I will watch again.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This was a book chosen for our book club group. Several members of the group thought it was wonderful. I found it rather tedious. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood at the right time.  Viewed as an allegory it was okay. Viewed as a story I thought it was rather boring.
B000FC11JW|5.0|Peter Drucker's classic work, the effective executive, provides the starting point for the discussion about the difference between efficiency and effectiveness. While a lot of blogs and books today are focused on efficiency&#34; life hacking&#34;, Peter Drucker focuses in his work on &#34;effectiveness.&#34; Peter emphasizes that it is the executive's job to focus on doing &#34;the right things.&#34; As a young professional starting out this is a very helpful book to read and I would definitely encourage others to read this bit of compact and practical business wisdom.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Doctor Sleep! I read The Shining when it was first released and I've always believed it to be 100 times better than the book. Doctor Sleep not only brings Constant Reader up-to-date as far as Danny is concerned, it also introduces another very interesting character. Very well done!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Enjoyed the story and can't wait to read the third book of the series. Will recommend it to others to read if they enjoy suspense
0783231032|5.0|Bought this movie for a gift for my father,because we couldn't find it in the stores.  Fast shipping, and my father enjoyed seeing this movie again.  Movie was in great shape.
B005544TRQ|3.0|I found the 2nd season first and then viewed the first season.  The first season was as entertaining as the 2nd season. I do not know if I would have found it as interesting, if I had seen the series in the intended order.  I hope the 3rd season as just as good!

0393317552|4.0|The book has a fold in the cover but overall it is in decent shape.  Looking forward to reading it.
B00EQ30RVY|4.0|I enjoy STP but have not felt their work was consistent since their second album - everything that followed had some hits and misses rather than containing the full awesomeness of their first two records. Frankly, I'd written them off as going nowhere at this point, with Scott Weiland's long-running personal drama.<br /><br />I hate Linkin Park. I hate it enough I won't even go look up if I spelled their name right. I could write an essay on why but the short reason is the vocalists and lyrics, brought to us in part by Chester Bennington. I am all for angst in music but his work with LP felt designed to rob priveleged 12 year-olds of their money by reminding them to scream an awful lot and be sad, sad little people.<br /><br />So when I listened to the single for this EP on youtube, I was doing so in that way one watches a train hit someone on the tracks - you can't look away even though you really want to.<br /><br />I did not expect to enjoy it. I did not expect to be impressed. However, I very much was. It works. Each song is tightly composed, memorable and catchy. And Chester has a great range that conveys depth and emotion - most importantly MATURE depth and emotion. No screaming at mommy and daddy to shut up but also pay attention to me blah blah.<br /><br />Frankly, if this was the lineup for the future of STP, I would not think twice about Scott Weiland, he had his time and as great as it was its not coming back. Time to move forward with what sounds good, and as reluctant as I am to say it this really does. A full album or two more of this and I might even forgive Chester his earlier works.

B00EQ30RVY|4.0|I don't think anyone was as skeptical as me when I heard Stone Temple Pilots was continuing on without Scott Weiland - the band was a huge part of my formative years and removing one of the key players sounded like blasphemy.When it was announced that Chester Bennington was filling the role, I was a little less apprehensive, but I still wasn't totally sold.<br /><br />But now that I've heard High Rise, I'm convinced that STP has a future beyond Weiland.<br /><br />Without going into a track by track breakdown, High Rise sounds much like where the band left off with Shangri La Dee Da, at least when that album delved more into the harder side of rock. Robert's bass is as clear and melodic as ever, and Dean delivers crunching riffs and jangly chords.<br /><br />All that aside, Chester himself is certainly the biggest surprise. His vocal delivery here is extraordinarily similar to Weiland's, maybe moreso when he was in Velvet Revolver than STP, but the resemblance is still uncanny. However, Chester's voice is far more powerful than Weiland's has been in years, and he has an equal amount of grit to power through the rock songs. The only thing I can really take away from his performance is on the lyrical side. There's nothing particularly cringe worthy, but I can't say they really stand out, or stand alongside Weiland's penchant for word soup.<br /><br />All things considered, if you like Stone Temple Pilots, and aren't diametrically opposed to them carrying on with a new singer, chances are you'll enjoy this 5-song affair. All the trademarks of the band are still there, if you're willing to listen.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|A good script, a good cast, lead to a great movie! Ben Affleck proves he knows how to make a movie leaving film lovers glued to the screen. Ben plays a criminal mastermind with a crew that works very well together. Jon Hamm plays an FBI agent who swears to bring him down. When the opening scene of Ben and his crew taking a bank down goes wrong, they take a hostage, an employee from the bank. When they release her they learn she talks to the cops and lives in the vicinity where the crew lives. Fearing she will lead the FBI to them, the crew wants to take her out, but Ben says no. He courts her, dines her, tries to get the feel for what her plans are. Jon Hamm diligently does everything his power allows him to find out who this crew is and bring them down. When Ben tries to get out of town before it's too late, his crew threaten him. He must pull off one last heist before being given his freedom.<br /><br />The Town is an exciting movie that you will not want to miss. It has action, drama, suspense all rolled into one.<br /><br />David Lucero, author

With their own place on earth they came together to form a band true to the heart and souls of who - and what- they had become. They became MORE than an ordinary man yet walked among them often hidden by their realities.<br />Anyone that like science fantasy or adventure should be able to engage with the  story presented!

B00F99EMRE|5.0|Why would I purchase music that I already own? I asked myself. After listening online to a couple of samples and comparing it to the original version I was convinced. I wanted to hear what Getty said was missing from the original. Besides I did not have the complete album anyway.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Thank you for finishing Danny's story. Thank you for again making me afraid to read at night when things go bump and slither (but if you think I'm going to go look you are insane). Absolutely brilliant, and a perfect sequel to The Shining.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with a backpack case or a conventional-type bag for my camera storage/transporting needs, but after using this little backpack for a couple of weeks, I sure am glad I went this route. Keeps hands free and stays in place if you're an active, outdoorsy type person. Great while hiking and horseback riding. Tough, padded & durable design keeps your stuff safe, and the exterior is easy to clean/wipe off with just a damp rag.<br />Design-wise, it has lots and lots of storage compartments/zippered pockets that gives you a place for everything and everything in it's place. Plenty of room for my 2 cameras, 2 lenses, flash unit, hoods, chargers, etc. and enough pockets to keep my filter kits, extra SD cards/thumbdrives, journal & manuals in their own little places. Great for the amateur/weekend photographer.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving this little bag 5 stars was the tripod storage area. I can't seem to get it to contain the tripod securely, and the tripod keeps sliding out of the straps. (May be 'user error') But this little issue won't keep me from recommending this bag highly. For it's price, it's a pretty good deal!
B0089MXRII|5.0|Julia Gousseva has a fine eye for placing her characters in a landscape - political, emotional, cultural - and then bringing both the character and that backdrop to life. I discovered this reading her acclaimed novel Moscow Dreams and was pleased to find the style carries over to this collection of 12 short stories, each set in a different month of the year and again taking us on a journey back into her own Moscow childhood.<br /><br />While we are treated to astute observations about the shortages and harsh realities in the lean years of the former Soviet Russia - has very much really changed, one is forced to ask? - the stories are grounded in the quotidian life of a young girl, her thoughts and fears, her dreams and doubts - the feeling of freezing fingers in harsh winters, the joy of plants pushing through thawing snow, fruit appearing on the trees, days that seem to last forever. Gousseva gives the commonplace a sense of majesty and wonder and, seen through the eyes of a child, we feel locked in the moment. The writing is elegiac, controlled; the stories, linked by running themes that are Dostoyevskian in depth and draw a vivid portrait of the culture of the times.
140006922X|5.0|Frankly, the particularly devout of certain stripe will be uncomfortable, if not outraged, at his conclusions.  Firstly, it must be noted that the author has no wish to take issue with the Messiahship of Jesus of Nazareth, but rather the core of his earthly mission: The plight of the poor and disenfranchised, something many have utterly forgotten.  He takes issue, as have other writers, with the laying of &#34;blame&#34; for Jesus' execution with the Jews of 1st century Jerusalem, instead pointing the finger squarely at Pilate (who is indeed &#34;blamed&#34; in the Creed most Christians recite every Sunday) and the occupying forces of Rome. He dwells more than a bit on Jesus' more rebellious and bellicose statements, but contrary to what some have written, does not entirely ignore Jesus' pacifistic tendencies.  He has given us a detailed and fascinating picture of life in Israel under the Roman yoke, and of one man who spoke against it and reminded his followers of their duties to those less advantaged than others.

B00DJWV11I|4.0|This book is told from the guys point of view. I really liked it a lot. The narration style had freezes with thrown in analogies, metaphors and hindsight reflections.

B00FEX1AA2|5.0|This movie is scarier in the first 10 minutes than some moves are in their entirety. Finally, a return to the non-compromising horror movie, one that doesn't include humor to \\"break the tension\\". It reminds me of the original Amityiville Horror movie. The use of CGI is minimal, thank God; there is nothing quite like bad CGI to completely ruin the atmosphere of a good horror tale. Get some popcorn, turn out the lights, find someone to snuggle with and enjoy!
B0036S4B6M|2.0|The series is much better than the book; however they are very different. The series creator put their spin on it to liven it up.

You don't need to have read (or remember) Stephen King's THE SHINING to enjoy its outstanding (and long time in coming) sequel, DOCTOR SLEEP.<br /><br />The novel begins at the Overlook with enough info to either refresh your memory or to get you started with the characters, either way - and then we quickly see protagonist Dan Torrance, a little older but still a child, reaching out to his shining \\"mentor\\" Dick Hallorann, where he's going to learn a few things that will be useful to him as an adult later in the story.<br /><br />This is important because in DOCTOR SLEEP it's Dan who is going to become the mentor / teacher - but rather than just throw readers into that part of the story, King does a masterful job of leading us down the path to where Dan is finally in the position to be the \\"teacher.\\"<br /><br />First he's got to hit bottom - and he does, because just like his father he's an alcoholic - and then he runs from his problem until he finally ends up in New Hampshire, gets some help battling his addiction, and eventually builds a life that for the first time is one he'd like to hold onto.<br /><br />Along the way, as we are watching Dan finally square away his personal life, we also catch glimpses of the True Knot, a group of not-quite-humans who caravan in RVs across the country and feed off the \\"steam\\" of kids who have the shine, and we also meet Abra Stone, the girl with the shine that Dan is eventually going to help. When King finally brings all the pieces together - Dan, Abra, and the True Knot - the story comes full circle with THE SHINING in some surprising and very satisfying ways.<br /><br />There is plenty of creepiness and more than a few opportunities to jump or scream if you're reading late at night in the dark. There are also plenty of lyrical passages that offer wit, humor, and remarkable insight into humanity as we know it today - which isn't surprising, given King's growth as a writer over the decades.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best books that I've read in a very long time.g's growth as a writer over the decades.<br /><br />This is easily one of the best books that I've read in a very long time.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Just what I wanted! It's slim-lined, sexy and protects without being bulky and taking away from the sleek design of the phone.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|some humor but flashbacks to childhood in orphanage was so so sad almost depressing but human spirit can survive due to loyal and loving friends and family.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I can't ever find the words I need! There needs to be a table of contents or something. You can't expect us to just know we're to go
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'll keep this short.Absolutely fantastic novel.The plot had me in the first paragraph. This was by far one of the best Stephen king novels I've read.I'm happy he chose to go back into Danny's world.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|This is another Zombie end of world as we know it film.  That being said, I found it to be one of the better films and the story line was good.  Pitt did a good job in his part and the supporting cast as well.  It is nice, to find a film with this subject that really is a film and not just a rehash of those made decades ago.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie because I usually like movies such as The Reef or Open Water where some people get stranded in the middle of the ocean and struggle to survive for days.  However, these college kids in &#34;Frozen&#34; start out with such vulgar mouths and disrespect toward other people, it is difficult to care what happens to them.  SPOILER ALERT:  Once they are stranded on a ski lift after it is turned off and everybody leaves for a week, they realize the seriousness of their predicament, and their personalities begin to show more compassion.  The film never really focuses or is able to make you FEEL the sheer height of the ski lift, so a lot of the fear is lost.  You DO realize how dangerous the low temperatures are, but so many people are afraid of heights that it would have been a valuable aspect of their dilemma on which to focus.  The acting is good, the cinematography is ok, the pacing is slow and the soundtrack is good.  For some reason it just didn't all add up to &#34;OK&#34;.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game. Wish points could accrue faster to play several games. Wish we could stack matching cards to make game more challenging.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is awesome for the whole family. We have enjoyed building it and caring for the creatures.<br /><br />The graphics are awesome!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was beautifully written. What an amazing story of friendship! I loved it!!!  Looking forward to reading more by this author.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|Just tooo much....to many sub-plots, too dragged out.  Started out ok but then became to involved with weird stuff.  Lost me half way through.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|This was a movie that took me back to my child hood. I really enjoyed the blue ray version. The wild west with out all the violence and gore of modern movies..
B004LWZW24|4.0|This is my second time watching \\"Insidious\\".  I was a lot smarter this time because I watched it in full daylight while someone else was home!  This is a wonderfully SCARY movie!  Everything works:  great cast, scary soundtrack, awesome cinematography, completely creepy atmosphere, and you feel like you really descend into one ring of Hell toward the end!  Any time a demon grabs your foot from beneath a bed, that is horrifying...I'll be running and LEAPING into bed for a month!  Granted, I'm sure you saw scenes that you could have tailored made to be more scary for you, but all-in-all this was SCARY!  It's not a documentary, so suspend your disbelief and enjoy getting SCARED!  This movie will DO IT!
6305692572|5.0|Andy Garcia and Meg Ryan are believable actors with believable characters in the movie.  Good storyline and well-developed. Good value, too.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Watched from the start and it keeps getting better! Love all the new stuff with the ladies, of course, as well :)
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|The album is okay. Not there best work but Bon Jovi is like pizza, even just an okay album is good and satisfying.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app. Everything you need in one place. The only thing that could improve this would be radar; but this is worth every penny.
0385335989|5.0|Another all time favorite author writing historical fiction = my favorite kind of reading - wonderful characters and great time in history - can't wait to see it on DVD
B00015YVDG|4.0|This thriller has some jaw-dropping twists.  It also has all of the elements (great acting, writing, soundtrack, directing, cinematography, cast, etc.) that make up a blockbuster.  This 2-hour movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is a fun ride all the way.<br /><br />A multi-millionaire (Mel Gibson), his wife (Renee Russo) and their son are in Central Park for an event when, in the blink of an eye, their son is taken.  The most desperate feeling in the world descends on these parents as they realize he didn't just wander away and will be right back.  Soon enough they receive the first ransom demand.  You see the movie from the perspective of the parents, the police and the kidnappers which makes it all the more interesting.<br /><br />This received 4 stars instead of 5 stars because it isn't the kind of movie that I watch every time it comes on cable.  That is the true test of a 5-star movie.  However, I highly recommend \\"Ransom\\" if you haven't seen it.  It is worth the 2 hours!
B00634GHJA|4.0|The app sometimes hangs on my computer but still less of a pain than getting up to plug in the usb cord
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Easy to understand and simple step by step instructions. However I think page numbers are important, and there should be more examples for the more creative and useful links for the alike.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I waited for this cover until the price was reduced and it was worth the wait. I love this cover.  The color and lettering very nice.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|cant really get these anywhere anymore they are outdated but they hold alot of pics and it made my wife very happy
0385335997|5.0|Please see my review on this author and her series above at Drums of Autumn - please read these books if you love historical fiction
B00080DIWE|5.0|Make a great gift for those who work on models and much easier to paint with. Would recommend to use.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Although eye opening, the span of roles of the main character required a leap beyond suspension of disbelief. At times, the story line as very circuitous.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Our granddaughters just love this sticker pad! One is 4 and the other is 8 so there is a four year difference in age. It's hard to find things they like to play with together but this keeps them interested and busy for a long time. It's nice for their imaginations, they love to dress up the little dolls and the older child enjoyed popping out the stickers when they first got the pads.
B0089LOG02|5.0|We read this for our book club and we all loved it.  Great uplifting story.  Good story of perserverance and hope
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Well it says it all, I could not put it down! Kept my attention through the whole book and kept me guessing. Such a talented writer with a unique and powerful story line!!
B001IHJ97E|5.0|Excellent movie with an outstanding cast. Watched last night for first time in nearly 20 years and it still holds up and resonates well. The relationships are honest and complicated and the story is solid.<br />Would make an incredible movie night paired with Altered States and Strange Days, two other excellent movies with overarching themes.
B008SAZHLQ|2.0|Sorry, but this book seemed so trite and contrived that I couldn't waste my time reading it. It sounded pretty adolescent, like a worse version of nick and norah's infinite playlist. The writing was &#34;trying too hard&#34; and you can feel it when you are reading.
B000W91RUG|5.0|One of the best Comedy series in a long time. My husband and I love it and own all seasons currently on dvd.
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|Great concept but the voice is just awful.  It is bad to the point that I had no choice but to delete the app.  Digital voices were cool in the 80's, in an 8-bit world and it worked for GLADoS in Portal (although that voice was MUCH more pleasent) , but in a text to speech app, no way.
B000002P72|5.0|Anybody who likes the Blues must have this in their collection. I have listened to it over and over again!
B004IYM2YQ|5.0|The only nation wide play Talk Talk recieved was on MTV for \\"It's My Life,\\" unless you lucky enough to have had a good college raido station around... which I did. Color Of Spring was and is awesome, but so are the 2 before and the 2 after this release, I am so greatful I found them in the mist of that era on the radio, in the clubs, and at home. Talk talk's work stands the test of time as inspired stuff, I whish more people found it at the time, it's like the idea that a good wine makes the meal, good music makes the memories.<br /><br />James<br /><br />Older<br />[[ASIN:B00775D76A Party Is Over]][[ASIN:B000007MVK It's My Life]]<br /><br />Newer than Color Of Spring, more moody<br />[[ASIN:B000001FZK Laughing Stock]][[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit of Eden]]
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out.  It was a very sad disturbing film that made me fall in love with the sweet gentle John Merrick.  John Hurt was amazing in this role and I think this was the first time I became aware of Anthony Hopkins.  I'm glad to add this to my library.
B008469DGY|4.0|Easy to play on kindle Fire, but gets a bit monotonous. Difficult to determine where the ball is going to land though.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Would you please fix your app? It use to work perfectly on my kindle fire hd and now I can't even log in!
B0097K21YW|5.0|Unlike so many other Android and iPhone games, this one has not lost it's appeal.  After playing off and on for about 3-4 months, it is still a very fun game
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|So sad but I loved every minute of the book!!! I couldn't put it down, It seemed like I could feel how the main characters felt
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun all in one game that will keep you playing for hours! I hope you guys feel the same.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|Kate Winslet was her normal self.  Excellent.  I found the story very interesting and sad.  Something that stayed with me for days.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Pros:<br />Fun to play, great graphics, unique tracks, awesome cars, easy to figure out<br /><br />Cons:<br />Crashes on kindle fire 2nd gen at least once every 30 mins, unrealistic vehicle speeds( a Audi R8 should have a higher top speed then a stock dodge dart), when you do hit top speed the motor and trans keep going up too 9+ gears but your cruising at 135 mph which was hit in 3rd gear.<br /><br />There is no Subaru in the game either : (
B003YGSLDA|5.0|This is an excellent remake of an old family favorite. If you had not seen the older version, you would think this was just produced.
B00DB31Y3U|2.0|Mechanics weren't quite right and the concept is just plain silly.  Flying a helicopter indoors, is this really what we want to teach our children? Might I suggest you next create a game that has the player set up as a 5 year old throwing rocks at other kids?  10 Bonus points if you knock of the nerds glasses and break them...
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book deals with the struggle women have to balance work and home life. Sandburg does it in a non-judgy way and that is nice. So many things you read make you feel guilty for wanting both a career and a family. She is considerate of those who choose to stay home, but her audience is those of us who desire to be not only part of the work force, but in a leaderership role. Read it, gift it, live it!
B009LDD1X0|4.0|Big Bang season 6 is funny but buy this through eBay this was not worth spending so much money !
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I enjoyed this game app immensely.  Although I wish there were more levels, there was plenty of enjoyment and repeatability on each level.  Used on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with no problems at all.  Easy game to pick up and put down without worrying about saving your current progress.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a tablet/kindle.  I cannot attest to how well you can aim on a phone due to the size of a phone's screen so that might be something to look into if you're getting this for a phone.
B005LAII80|2.0|Plot was none existent, action was done on the cheap, and there was very little variety, In a word boring and not what you would expect in the second installation. Instead of trying to outdo the first, this was a conscious attempt at scaling back. Without some of the uninspired violence, this could easily have been a made for TV movie. The main star never even takes off his helmet. Just goes to show how proud he was to be part of this disappointment.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is very inspiring and motivating for women and men.  It is a call to action that will make businesses stronger and lead to a more satisfied, productive, and empowered workforce.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|Great game and awesome original concept.  I only gave it 4 stars because it lacked the appeal needed to make it fun for more than a few days and I got bored with it quickly
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is one of the best albums Cher has ever made.  There really aren't any bad songs on it.<br />I got the special edition from Target. I love all the extra songs.  I think everyone should<br />buy one of the deluxe editions of \\"Closer To the Truth\\" to get all the great extra songs.<br />My favorite songs on the CD are \\"I Walk Alone\\" and the bonus cut \\"I Don't Have to Sleep to Dream\\"<br />but I don't really dislike any of the songs.  Cher never lets her fans down and this album<br />is another proof of that fact. Good job Cher. We are proud of you !!!  Really looking forward to<br />your Dressed to Kill Tour next Spring !!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss' writing shines.  The writing styles seem to change from scene to scene as Kvothe matures quite a bit in this sequeal to NoTW, which is an awesome feat and a pleasure to read.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very easy app to use and get the hang of.  It's basically logic puzzles where you are filling in a grid with blocks or empty squares.<br /><br />You have 5x5 puzzles, 10x10, and 15x15.  There is no time limit and you can exit at any time and pick up later where you left off.<br /><br />I found myself passing many hours with this app.  Highly recommended for any puzzler or logic solver.
B000FCKRDI|2.0|Such potential. Good chemistry between couple, but it just short of played short for me. It was quite boring, enough tht I kept skipping parts and then chapters, and then just plain gave up. Really disappointed. I guess I took a roll of the dice and came up snake eyes on this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun I works your ability to move quicker. Super great for pass time for little kids
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|This game was fun, but it very quickly lost it's appeal.  At first I was very in to the game and by about the 5th or 6th level I was annoyed at how repetitive it was.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Fantastic read! I laughed, I cried, as I took this heart wrenching journey that I can't believe isn't even real. I still feel so emotionally spent but not negatively so; just truly affected by the story and how it could be so real<br />.
0756405890|5.0|I can't get over how good the writing in this book is.  The characters and story are great but what will keep anyone reading this book is Rothfuss' ability to draw you in.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Mr. Hosseini has given to us, through his books, such a vivid picture of what the true horror of war is.  Also, I love his treatment of the horrible MISTREATMENT of women in the Middle East.  I do my best to appreciate the fact that I am who I am, born when I was born, in the wonderful time of my life, and to appreciate all the millions of privileges living in America has given to me.  I grew up in a<br />time when women didn't have many rights and lived into a time when so many women are banging on the glass ceiling without<br />having to die for that privilege.<br /><br />My thoughts always come back to the reality of there is no way I can fully appreciate all that I have been blessed with, I have never<br />had to live like the women of Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudia Arabia, etc etc etc.....I wish my sisters could be free.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|Eddie Vedder and all his amazingness, once again!! Never fails to impress. Great to just put on in the background and relax.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Everytime I try logging in it says this is taking longer than it should please try again in a bit. I've even tried to make a new account but it still doesn't work please fix this is a great app
B00243FQFA|4.0|Amazing series even though it was cut about 5 seasons too short in a failed venture for more money.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is not the same packaging as the first 4 seasons and therefore does not perfectly complete the set.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|These books always suck you in.  I always hate to put them down.  Stay up way too late reading to finish it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really liked this book and as it spoke to me personally, I believe it would speak to many.  The message is far reaching.  What an enjoyable format to get such a difficult, complicated subject, which is the value of life.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is Pink Floyd. David Gilmour is the man, the voice and the guitar. I'm still trying to emulate the tone. Wow!
0743270754|4.0|A tough and detailed read but very deep and thorough! Dont be discouraged by the length of the book. The movie was a wonderful compliment to the book.
B009RX8AQW|4.0|Love this series and the extras on this package help to explain the story line as well. Excellent choice for me.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Not many iPhone and Android games are as appealing and have as much lasting appeal as this one.  Very Fun!
B0045HCJSK|5.0|Our John Wayne collection is just about complete. We enjoy sharing our collection with our Grandkids. They seem to enjoy the more traditional values.
1878424319|5.0|This is a very positive book. Though  Hard to follow always but can be done. I highly recommend this book:)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Honestly, the best keyboard in Android, it saved your most frequently used words.<br />Now with the flow is very usefull with one hand in big screen phones, like my Lg Optimus G Pro
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love this album!! Should have won more awards, hands down. Constantly playing this album. There is no skippable song on this record. You will love them ALL. So deep and poetic too. Lyrics are amazing.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Very fun game but takes up WAY too much space on the phone even when &#34;moved&#34; to the SD card.Fix that and it will be a 5-star app.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|It's a great game for myself and my grand children. I loving playing before bed or just waiting for something, easy to pick up  and play.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|Most of the songs on this track are really good. I had to throw away her pictures that come in the CD because I think its gross that her (and Rihanna) think pictures of them grabbing their private's are sexy... I have a 9 year old son that doesn't need to see that crap. The music is mostly good if you can just not picture her singing it with her tongue sticking out...
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|This app is nothing special.  They claim no ads, but devote an entire page to them, just adds for their other apps I assume.  The weather channel app, or weather underground do the same things and more.  There are even apps that have non intrusive ads that do more than this one.  Immediately uninstalled.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|One of the best albums that I own!! I love the talent the lead singer has. I love his voice!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book because it had a lot of action in it.<br /><br />I recommend this book to teenagers who like action books.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Well... it's official. THERE IS A REASON IT IS ONLY FOR APPLE PRODUCTS!!! When u supposed to blow, you DIE IT WON'T WORK FOR KINDLE FIRES!!! I mean, why even download it when you know it's for Apple IPhones and iPads?!?!? I mean... REALLY??!!! Let me just cut to the chase; don't waste precious memory for that app<br />on your kindle. Get something else!!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Required reading for the ones working with clinical research. Accurate scientific descriptions and deep analysis of the human side of the story.
B006M4F67A|3.0|The app comes with multiple elvels adn includes a timed, and free paly version.  Love the app hours of fun.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|I think the boldest move that Tamashii Nations and Naoko made at the last minute was changing Sailor Moon's clothes from red to PINK! Yes, both bows, the glove bands, and the boots came in a metallic, gorgeous shade of pink, completely different from what's pictured above (the hair accessories and tiara gem remained a rich red), and I'm in love. I hope that Naoko decides to carry this costume change over in the reboot (should it ever happen).<br /><br />The figure itself was beautifully crafted, the pig tails do in fact pop out if stressed but easily and securely pop back in. The hair and faces were impossible to replace at first (almost seemed like they were glued in) but once you change them out a few times they become much easier to work with.<br /><br />The only criticism I can give for this toy relates to Luna. She is nearly impossible to stand up since her feet were made so close together, it's a pill to work with. Also, it would have been awesome if there was an additional tiara action accessory that was not adhered to a hand.<br /><br />I hope the rest of the figures are as beautiful and rich as this one, and that they plan on including some attack accessories for the rest of the girls down the road.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It keeps telling me I need to refresh but when I go to it says I can not refresh it when I go through everything
B00EP22QKG|4.0|A surprisingly supple and solid album, \\"Unvarnished\\" finds a mature Joan Jett and her long time associates, The Blackhearts, addressing life and the events that follow in a grown up world. Family, politics, personal strife are all touched upon. Even so, Jett commands a rocking album this time around, much more so than 2006's \\"Sinner.\\"<br /><br />Jett was affected by Superstorm Sandy, which she touches on in the opener, \\"Any Weather.\\" As much a rallying cry as a discussion of the events of the devastation, it deals with its subject without turning maudlin. In fact, it kicks butt. Jett also hits a tough chord when she sings about the loss of family members in both \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Hard To Grow Up.\\" She still loves rock and roll, but now she sees that love from the viewpoint of an adult.<br /><br />That doesn't mean Jett gives rocking the short shrift. \\"TMI\\" (too much information) and \\"Reality Mentality\\" looks at a world where stars are viewed through a paparazzi lens 24/7, and how musical reality shows invent stars that might not be worth the effort to get to know. Coming from a woman who had to shake off the slime of overhype to make her career count, show knows from where she preaches.<br /><br />\\"Unvarnished\\" is a self assured look at this modern world, even to the point where the usually obligatory cover song is passed on. Jett wants her work to stand for itself, and for the first time in many albums, \\"Unvarnished\\" maintains a standard that Jett set for herself in her lengthy career. Not bad for someone who now sees music she's created enter a fourth decade.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|The shipping was very fast.  Price was reasonable.  Content was funny as ever!!  Math, science, history, unraveling the mystery that all started with a Big Bang.  Bang!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This clock has several nice options to choose from. My favorite is the wordy clock. Very modern and cool. Dimmer and alarm features make this clock as functional as it is beautiful.
B005LHO274|5.0|Have always wanted to learn more about astronomy.  Love all the info on this app, especially the blue and golden hour times of each day, as well as the best things I can observe each night.  Love it.
0439023521|5.0|I watched the movie so well I streamed it twice...I am about halfway the book now and definitely will finish it soon....Great story both on film and in writing!!!
0399134204|5.0|Thanks for delivering this book in a timely fashion. Book came in good condition. Would have like the binding a much tighter. It seems as if the book was used and not new as described in the Amazon description for this book. This is due to the loose binding of the Cover and the Back of the book is very loose.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The excellent product for century 21, save you a lot money without use cable tv, direct tv. I bought 4 chromecast so far for my house, I would recommend to everyone.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was not short of expect stations at all it was a good way to continue the series! Great job Jeff kinney
0547848412|5.0|Great story which led to a great movie. Suspenseful, ultimately believable interplay of man and beast, each helping the other survive.
B005F9TQ9C|3.0|from what I heard about the history of this album, its not as bad as people think. I guess at the time it was a shock.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|No big deal.  Not one of his best novels but it's ok.  I would not recommend it to anyone else
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great cast! I've enjoyed the series even more than I thought I would. The character development, family dynamics, and interpersonal relationships really round out the show.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|my review is that i liked the part when he siad that he had a haunted  house but he really he only said that so that he could get some money for the actual halloween party at his school
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I found this book because the second part &#34; Wayward &#34; was on sale recently so I downloaded the free sample. I got really into it and wanted to read more than what the sample offered. So I went online and found out it was part two. So I downloaded part one &#34; Pines &#34; and have not been able to put it down. I just finished Pines and it was a great read. Downloaded Wayward last night and dove right in.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|This is probably one of the best titles in the Bootleg series. I prefer all of these versions to the offically released album versions found on &#34;New Morning&#34; and &#34;Self portrait&#34;
1781162646|5.0|Loved this book. Usually avoid Stephen King because he's scary, but not this book. Suspenseful but so well written, it's a pleasure to read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book made me cry. So moving. The characters play well. I'd recommend this book. I enjoyed it very much
B00E9P959O|1.0|No or hardly any Ride Cymbal on EVERY song. Sure its a remix, but they forgot to add the mic that was on the Ride. That's like taking a string off the guitar. PURE IDIOCY!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Such an awesome movie!!!! BC has cheekbones of doom!  Really they could not have cast the new series any better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very unique and creative storyline.  Kept me engaged throughout the entire book.  Can't wait to read others by this author.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I very much enjoyed the story. At times you think you've figured it out but soon find a twist not anticipated.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this little book...  it was well written and just pulled me right in.  I will certainly look into other books by this author and in this genre.
B001QB9ETK|4.0|Great movie, good story line based on historical events. I really admire Robert De Niro and once again his performance was excellent!!
B005LJITS0|3.0|Bad plot! could of be good. acting was ok. I thought Ryan did a good job but needed better script.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|You will be highly entertained. Tons of blood and gore. This is what movies are supposed to be. Entertaining as all get out.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|If you have a Kindle try removing game from device to your cloud, then download the app back to your device... It upgraded and worked for me...
0812983459|5.0|I was awash with emotion as I finished this lovely, heart touching book.  With the lives we live, filled as they are with things said and unsaid which impact others in ways we don't realize until later, this book shakes loose memories in a gentle, unassuming way, surrounding with tenderness long buried regrets. There is a healing balm in taking this pilgrimage with Harold. Highly recommend.
190949013X|5.0|What happens when the line between friendship and love blurs? Kristen Zimmer's The Gravity Between Us is a daring and emotionally charged story that explores this premise and hooks the reader from page one. Kendall and Payton have been friends since childhood. Neither can remember a time when they were not there for one another. So when Kendall's life is transformed by Hollywood and its haze of glamour and perfection, her love for Payton becomes a secret she must guard. Can the two young women deal with the pressure of fame--especially when staying true to oneself feels impossible in the fame game?<br /><br />The Gravity Between Us is a fantastic read--humorous, romantic and daring. Kristen's writing style is engaging and honest. In Payton and Kendall, she's succeeded in creating characters whom you care about instantly. And her portrayal of their relationship is beautifully rendered. I loved the Hollywood angle, the question of how one learns to deal with other people's reactions to same sex relationships and the idea of the zany game that is celebrity.<br /><br />For me, The Gravity Between Us is a must-read new adult novel! I can't wait to read Kristen Zimmer's next book!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|but not good. Its was slow pace. some laughs on way. First two were more crazy. Make sure you watch through the credits. The best part of movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Augh...this was such a good show, I wish they had more seasons. Totally recommend. I did however, have to (always) mute the opening sequence. So scary, the music freaked me out.
B004NELBPC|3.0|I get a lot of info, but find it so slanted to the left.  I'm not a right or a left wing person.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great for dinner ideas. Also awesome holiday ideas! addicting for sure! Trying to not look is hard. Wonder what I did before...
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|As I sat tonight, riveted to my TV, I once again got to feel the adrenaline rush, my pulse pound and watch THE Gold Standard in everything Good, Evil & Beautiful. (Jared & Jensen). Not since &#34;Scully & Mulder&#34; has there been such extraordinary chemstry. Jared & Jensen bring to life two brothers that would literally go to hell and back for each other. I could go on, but by now...you probably have me figured out. This IS the show...<br /><br />I received my Blu-Ray edition of Season Eight, and in one day, I had a Season 8 marathon.<br /><br />You CANNOT just buy this season. You need to start with Season One.<br /><br />Jared & Jensen. Thank you! I love you both for bringing this show to life, and allowing me to get &#34;lost&#34; for one hour.<br /><br />You have my heartfelt thanks.
B0000714BP|5.0|What can I say about this movie.. it was great. Loved watching Swayze.. god rest him.... My daughter enjoyed the movie as well.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was  a PLEASURE to read. I wanted to savor every word. Such a great story from beginning to end. You won't be able to put it down. You will lose sleep over it. And you will love every minute and even, slow it down so it'll last longer.
0763644765|5.0|We have the &#34;No No, Yes Yes&#34; Leslie Patricelli book, which my son loves.<br />So when I saw the Potty book in TJ Maxx (best place for bargain books) I snapped it up.<br /><br />At 19 months we're just starting to potty-train. So each night he sits on his potty and we read &#34;Potty&#34;. When I say the p-word he pats his potty, and the page where the baby is desparate to go potty &#34;haaa, mmm, heee&#34;, my son joins in the noises with glee.<br /><br />He loves the cat & dog in the book too, and the page where baby has succeeded &#34;hooray&#34;, my son throws his arms up and cheers.<br /><br />Basically he loves all the pages in the book and we don't get bored of reading it every night as it's nice & short.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My granddaughter had seen the movie and asked for this DVD and was delighted to receive it.  I was happy to see her reaction.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|At first, I played only the Blues disc almost exclusively - then went to see Buddy at the Palladium in Carmel IN (Indy).  Came home and now drive to/from work with the Rhythm disc on.  After about 2 times through - I am leaning toward this being the better of the two CDs - more soulful maybe, a bit softer and refined - though I love Buddy unleashed.  ANYWAY YOU CUT IT - great album for the old Buddy fan or the new convert - like my 23yr old son who joined my for the show.  He plays by feel and it makes me feel damned good!
0312370849|5.0|There was nothing in this book NOT to love.  It had every element necessary to a great story.  With history I had been completely ignorant of, wonderfully created characters, and a plot that twisted and turned, I was enthralled!!!  My emotions were all over the scale from beginning to end!!!
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I bought this for a HTPC build.  I chose this CPU because of its included GPU, which would forgo the need to buy a separate graphics card.  So far it's been a great decision.  Media plays beautifully!<br /><br />The price point on this chip beat a similar I3.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book based on it's great reviews & I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />My 19 month old son is techno-obsessed (tv, ipad etc.) but he is also a big book fan. He's old enough to follow the instructions &#34;shake the book&#34;, &#34;blow on the dots&#34; and claps his hands when the page is turned and something 'magical has happened to the dots.<br /><br />When you get to the last page and you're encouraged to go back to the start, we quite often do!<br /><br />It's quite a big book and the pages are paper, it would be nice if this was available as a big board book to make it a bit sturdier and easy to handle.
067003830X|5.0|it arrived early and in fine condition.  The information is great to know.  The stories are very interesting and the ideas presented are ahead of most current ideas on the brain.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|From Rock to Blues and now Guy - somehow, this seems to fit.  Never heard of him before and then an interview on NPR led me to this album.  I have to say that if your track follows similar to mine - you will really like this and other Guy Clark albums.  It's a whole new world out there, even if it's old stuff you never thought you'd hear.  Heartfelt with 2 life's worth of experience - the story telling puts you in the middle of a picture as it is being painted around you.  Gotta get this one, and enjoy a quiet evening with a great story teller/songwriter.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|Claims that when you pay there are no ads. This is a blatant lie as there is an entire page dedicated to ads. Not sure I want to explore the rest of the ap after this up front lie. Glad I got it through faotd.
B005VPRG10|5.0|Colby (age 9) had been wanting this for awhile when I surprised him.  Put it together immediately and it looks great.  He'll take it apart and put it back together several times.
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|This is a pretty useless app. The information provided within this app is just basic at best. The Weather Channel app includes more information including weather alerts and radar.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|This is a good film.  It is entertaining and the visual effects are dynamic.  The story does not follow the Marvel Comics story; so if you are a purist about the comics, this is not the movie for you.  If you can get past the changing of the story line, it is enjoyable.
B0073COMUW|3.0|I just received my first four Ever 10 watt bulbs. They are bright, clear, lights which I like. While reading in bed, I,ve noticed that most of the light projects up and little is available for reading.  This is a big draw back. However, the wall and ceiling have great light.
B000W9399S|1.0|THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE KINDLE EDITION ONLY<br /><br />While I love the book (what I can read of it, at any rate), this Kindle edition is atrociously formatted. Sentences are garbled, out of order, or missing altogether. Scraps of whatever formatting jargon was used to create this mess sometimes appear in the text - chapter one is titled \\"Type='application/vnd.adobe-page0templHE COLOR OF MAGIC.\\" One notable sentence reads \\"This this place?'tiMtheory was popular among academics.\\" This junk continues.<br />If you want to read this great novel, find a physical copy, or buy your ebook elsewhere.<br /><br />Don't keep feeding Amazon. They try to pull this often.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a little heavy on the Facebook and Twitter quests.  I wish there was a way to ignore quests like these.  Other than that, a good game overall.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I bought this to go with my copy of The Piano Guys after I saw them on the OPB Fund raiser for the local station.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|I found this film a little weird, and I don't mean zombie weird.  The plane scene was unrealistic.  Oh heck the whole movie was unreal. However, it was a diversion for as couple of hours.
B005DI66N4|5.0|I had read this book back in around 1960. After lending it out never received it back. So now I am enjoying it again.
B001UW58YK|5.0|Great concert recorded at the wiltern Theatre in L.A. (PBS special). This concert is extremely entertaining the image quality is very good and Buble is a great performer. I would recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have a severa problem with this device, no function with Android on nexus 4, in my country Colombia I don't download here, in the description no say this problem, now I have this product without service...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I didn't even know they had made U Tube until I tuned into the local Public broadcasting station fund raiser and saw them in concert.  The station played some of the ads they had made which made them popular.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Yes I said typical. Especially for a Schwarzenegger movie.  But it was still enjoyable even with the corny one liners.  Maybe that was best part of the movie.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Suspend disbelief and enjoy.  This one's for the whole family to enjoy.  The cast is great together, and the twist at the end is a sneaky one.  If you can go for the extended version, there are necessary scenes that will make the story more fluid.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I liked it<br />I liked when Greg took a picture with a man<br />I recommend it for my brother Jonathan
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I'm still just using it to see Youtube video. It can't cast web browser through smartphone(can cast through Chrome web browser of PC version).<br />If Roku added Youtube and web browsing function, I would have bought Roku.<br />Chromecast still needs lots of upgrade. Even Chromecast extension is beta version.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|As a long time Korn fan since 1998, Jonathan Davis and the Gang bring back the heavy guitars in full force in the 2013 album, The Paradigm Shift, with powering, crushing riffs blended with @ss kicking vocal harmonies and roaring screams of the past, with just a sparse hint of synthetic sound of the future.<br />What's most impressive? Of the 13 songs (deluxe version), they all deliver on the above goal, resulting in one of the arguably best albums ever released by Korn.<br />1. Prey For Me  5/5<br />2. Love & Meth  5/5<br />3. What We Do  4/5<br />4. Spike In My Veins  5/5 +<br />5. Mass Hysteria 4/5<br />6. Paranoid And Aroused  4/5<br />7. Never Never  5/5<br />8. Punishment Time  4/5<br />9. Lullaby For A Sadist  4/5<br />10. Victimized  4/5<br />11. It's All Wrong  4/5<br />12. Wish I Wasn't Born Today (deluxe)  3/5<br />13. Tell Me What You Want (deluxe)  5/5 +<br />Overall? Awesome.<br /><br />On my 3rd listen, and it's exactly what I wanted to hear from Korn, as though they read our reviews and said, \\"Let's ease up on all of the dub step synths, bring in more heavy guitars, bring back the anger and screams, while retaining the great melody.\\" Mission accomplished.<br /><br />Biggest surprise of the year. The Paradigm Shift delivers the heaviness many fans wanted in both vocals and guitars.<br /><br />Deluxe Version: As with the previous Deluxe version of their last album, and a number of others, Korn saves some of their best tracks for the bonuses. Oftentimes, you can't get these tracks unless you buy the deluxe album, and if you're a diehard Korn fan, don't pass it up. The included DVD Documentary covers 1 hour of Korn's journey and creation of this killer album, including Welch's return and his reasoning, along with Korn being open minded and mature enough to bring back a former member. Great info.<br /><br />Fun Fact: One night before the release of the album, Korn played on stage during the Jimmy Kimmel Show, performing Never Never to well deserved applause.<br />Metal album of the year? You decide.e.<br />Metal album of the year? You decide.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|It is the Best &quot; Take your music anywhere&quot; app.<br />All genres and types. I am listening all the time.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is awesome, now i do not have to go through my browser to get to it allowing me a faster way to use it. its really helpful.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie is great I recommend to buy or rent this movie I really like the movie it also have good effects.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I love movies, but over the past few years I have gravitated (no pun intended) more towards watching them at home rather than in the theater. I heard a LOT about this movie and devided to go and see what all the fuss was about. I did not read any reviews, however, I just saw a bunch of high scores. I was dismayed to be forced into a 3D showing, because they are usually mere gimmicks and more expensive. But upon leaving this movie, I not only have a renewed interest in going to the theater' but am a true believer in 3D as an effective medium. In this movie, 3D not only propels the story, but is a character itself!<br /><br />This movie is like a terrifying dream that doesn't stop! I was never so relieved to look over to my fellow viewers and come to the relization that what I was seeing was not in my own reality.<br /><br />I cannot heap enough praise upon this masterpiece of filmmaking!!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  I would've given it 5 stars if I weren't confused about a couple aspects of playing.  The good news is that I am not deterred in wanting to play more so I can figure it out!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I swear if they brought this musical back to Broadway I would see it over and over again. By far still the best even on DVD. My whole family just enjoys this amazing Andrew Loyd Weber production. THE BEST!!!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Got this as a FAOTD last week and it was my first exposure to this form of puzzle. Great game, the different levels of difficulty help ease you into the complexity of the logic decisions. Would consider purchasing another set from this developer.
B008JFUO72|5.0|This DVD is great because you receive the video, a digital coy and a free poster! I recomend to buy this
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I love it how he's like this back figure who portrays himself in this weird manner. Makes him likable. Thoroughly.
0425263924|5.0|I can't wait for the 4th one to come out.  I have really enjoyed reading this series and it has a great story!
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I like this game but it never connects to Facebook and now it won't let me on because it needs an update that is not available from Amazon.  Please fix and I would give the game 5 stars.
0307887448|4.0|Great read. Fast paced and incredibly involving. I loved all of the 80's references. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book certainly wasn't a disappointment. I loved the way he brought a lot of the things from The Shining into this awesome story. Keep it up Mr.King! I would recommend this book to everyone!
0425263916|5.0|I am so glad that I started reading the Crossfire series.  It does remind me of the 50 Shades of Gray, but the story line is also really good!  Great read and can wait for the next one to come out!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This album saw the return of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch. It's about time Korn went back to their real sound. I liked all of their albums a lot but I think that the last really KORN sounding record was Untouchables. Take a Look in The Mirror lacked the lyrical impact of their earlier records. See You on the Other Side was a lot poppier and kind of industrial, the same with Untitled except the production was a lot more raw and David Silveria was gone. They brought in Several drummers and it was their weakest album to me. Korn 3: Remember who you are saw Korn trying to go back to their roots and Ray Luzier recorded his first album in the band. It was heavy, but not in the same way as old school Korn, but Ray's drumming was a huge improvement over the last effort. The Path of Totality was just so different. Mixing Dubstep and Rock, and leaving Ray's skills on the sideline. Then Head came back. Thank God. This album is everything you want in a Korn album. Heavy Guitars, pounding bass, grooving drum beats, and soaring vocals. If you didn't like Korn before you won't now. I give the standard edition of this album 4.5/5 stars, and the Deluxe 5/5. It's amazing.<br /><br />1. Prey For Me- 5/5 stars: It starts off with that classic Korn groove, Heavy and Low. Then you hear the vocals and it sounds like Jonathan Davis around the Untouchables era. The chorus is a beast. My favorite part is the breakdown, You hear Jonathan Davis scream like a mad man like he did in Take a Look in the Mirror. I have to add that the guitar parts are very well put together.<br /><br />2. Love and Meth- 5/5 stars: Once again the guitar playing is the main focus in this song to me. They Mix in some electronics, but it really compliments the Korn sound on this track. The bass in this song is amazing.  Jonathan is once again on his A game and mixes melody with roaring screams. The highlight vocally is the third verse. He sounds like a demon. The chorus is so epic in this song.<br /><br />3. What We Do- 4/5 stars: The groove in this song is once again undeniably old school Korn. The lyrics are really good in this song in particular. There are a lot of different things going on in this song. The vocals aren't the best on the album, but it kind of reminds me of My Gift To You off of Follow the Leader.<br /><br />4. Spike in My Veins- 4/5 stars: This song is very electronically driven. I think that its pretty good however. You hear some serious riffing on this track, and it's a lot different from most Korn-like riffs. The vocals in this song are very intriguing. It has melodic parts and rap inspired hard rock verses as well. It is a cool song if nothing else.<br /><br />5. Mass Hysteria- 5/5 stars: KORN!! This is a classic Korn song. I love it. The opening is creepy and the guitar is grooving and heavy. It has a tight sound. The lyrics are very creative and thought provoking and I love hearing those off key melodies in the background. The chorus in this song is my favorite on the standard edition album. The breakdown is so cool also, It is heavy but holds back the release. It is cool to hear the band trying new techniques.<br /><br />6. Paranoid and Aroused- 4/5 stars: This is a very different Korn riff. I love the effects. The vocals are very creatively performed. I think of the movie Seven for some reason when I hear this song. lol. I really enjoy the darkness of this song. Also, hearing Jonathan freak out always adds to a tracks heaviness.<br /><br />7. Never Never- 3/5 stars: This is just a radio track. I didn't care for it. Its catchy and has great use of vocal harmony but the instrumentation is basic at best. I was surprised to hear so few fills from Ray. The breakdown is the only part that really gives away that this is a Korn song and not Linkin Park. Didn't do it for me.<br /><br />8. Punishment Time- 4/5 stars: If you just heard the instrumentation you would think it was from Korn or Life is Peachy. But when Jonathan starts singing those Metal lyrics in such a melodic way it works amazingly well. Also the lyrics are brilliant. The chorus didn't really fit to me though. The vocal break down after the second chorus is so cool. Then It explodes in your face. Gooood song.<br /><br />9. Lullaby For a Sadist- 4.5/5 stars: I love this songs unique sound. But it is so un-Korn in the verses. The lyrics however counter that the song makes sense. I really enjoy the two melodies going on during the chorus. The chorus is so good.The breakdown in this song is very cool as well. I love the sound effects Jonathan Davis makes in the background.<br /><br />10. Victimized- 3.5/5 stars: The drumming is spectacular in this song. Thank you Ray for mixing it up. The riffs are classic Korn. Fieldy is really cool in this song. I didn't really care for this songs vocal delivery of the verses but I did like the chorus and the lyrical content.<br /><br />11. It's all Wrong- 5/5 stars: I thought the electronic intro was cool, and the riffage is very interestingly different. It is low like old school Korn but comes from a different direction to me. I like the lyrics. This has the best bridge on the album.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />12. Wish I wasn't Born Today- 5/5 stars: Holy crap the guitars are so good in this song, and it has a lot less sing-songy of a chorus. Its sounds like something that could have been on Issues. Jonathan Davis nails this track . This song is huge. I love it.<br /><br />13. Tell Me What You Want- 5/5 stars: This Is My favorite song on the album, hands down. It has kind of a Mudvayne sound to me. It has those creepy off-tune riffs in it. Aggressive vocals and the heaviest breakdown in Korn history. This is an AMAZING song. Munky and Head Tear it up hard on this track and Fieldy obliterates your speakers with his most energetic bass line since Need To on their first self-titled album. The lyrics are classic Korn. This is the ultimate Korn song to me.<br /><br />Reconciliation DVD: 4/5 stars: I was kind of hoping for a Who Then Now or Deuce type video again, but its more of a documentary. It gives good insight to the making of the album and how Korn and Head got reunited. its pretty cool overall.ic way it works amazingly well. Also the lyrics are brilliant. The chorus didn't really fit to me though. The vocal break down after the second chorus is so cool. Then It explodes in your face. Gooood song.<br /><br />9.

Goes to say that there's nudity, too. Duh.<br /><br />Very good ending to a great, entertaining series. The cast did a great job in finishing the story.<br /><br />We love you, Andy.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this game so much.  the only problem is that on the shooting level where you plug the wounds you cant plug more than two holes because of the kindle fire touch limit.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I purchased this product to try to revive my work for the digital world. It is fast and easy to use But I sent it back because of the poor quality of the scans. If you have the time to photoshop each scan then have at it. The film holder is clear and it lets in too much light causing a ghosting effect around the edges of the negative while scanning. They should make them solid black around the edges to limit the amount of light.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|Crazy concept!!! Certainly one to fantasize about and blame it on alcohol, moonlight and whatever. It did not hurt that he was also handsome, sexy and rich; hmmmmm, the stuff from which great day-dreams are made.<br /><br />J. E. Powell, Author
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Great gift for young grandchild for camping adventures! First time owning a knife and much appreciated. I enjoyed giving him the gift before he went camping.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a little confusing at the beginning with all the characters. As I figured them out the story is great! Would definitely recommend this to others.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Great for tracking stocks and catching biz news. Keep you informed and is great for quickly checking it on your phone or kindle.
B00E0SX118|5.0|This is such a funny movie. It made me laugh and smile. I have watched it at least 20 times. My favorite line?.....&#34;stay inside the family kill circle.&#34;
B00EO10M54|4.0|This is not the album I prepared for. The album is A LOT more emotional than I was expecting. Yes there are some party songs here. But there are also a lot of songs that have an emotional punch to them. I guess that shouldn't be that surprising considering her ex-fiancee Liam dumped her not too long ago. I own one Miley album (2008's \\"Breakout\\") and let's just say this is pretty much night and day in differences. Some of the songs don't actually work too well but a lot of them do I find. Sometimes you have to expect some failings when pursuing something completely different than what you did in the past. There are some explicit lyrics here but other songs aren't. Songs that quickly stood out were \\"Adore You\\", \\"We Can't Stop\\", \\"Wrecking Ball\\", \\"Do My Thang\\" and \\"Rooting For My Baby\\". \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is an explosive pop song! It's a tragic love song. \\"Do My Thang\\" is my favorite song on the album; it's a very fun, rebellious track with a dark club beat (Miley raps explicitly in it). \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is my second favorite song and possibly the most catchy hook on the album. \\"All I wanted to do was break you off/But all you did was wre-eh-eck me/You wre-eh-eck me.\\"<br /><br />I think Miley is gonna both gain and lose fans after they hear this. It's one of those polarizing albums. I happen to like it but I know some people will hate it. It's part pop, part dance pop, there are a couple of country influences and there are some dark beats on occasion. On top of all that there are a bunch of features with mostly rappers. On a couple of tracks Miley raps herself. I do admit a lot of it is entertaining. DON'T expect most of it to be appropriate for your 10 year old though. Miley is growing up and changing and so is her music. P.S. \\"4x4\\" is BY FAR the worst track on the album. It just doesn't work!<br /><br />4 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Do My Thang\\"<br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\"<br />\\"We Can't Stop\\" &<br />\\"On My Own\\"
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I like the story, it had me coming back for more, & I couldn't wait to read about what happened next.  However.  The writing is juvenile.  I felt like my 15 year old niece wrote this.  There are grammatical mistakes in this book that shouldn't have been missed, & could have been easily caught if more than one person read it before going to print.  Besides that the most annoying thing was the frequency with which the author contradicted himself.  In one chapter; Thorgrin couldn't believe his luck, & how accepted he felt.  Never in all his life had he felt so accepted.  Not two chapters later; Thorgrin couldn't believe his luck, & how accepted he felt.  Never in all his life had he felt so accepted.  This happens quite a bit in this book & I rolled my eyes at the writing & the author numerous times.  With all that said, I'm on to book 2, & I will most likely read the whole series.  I've read reviews comparing the author & the series to Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, Rick Riordan, & George R.R. Martin.  Seriously.  The only thing I have to say to that is NO!  The world isn't nearly as vivid, the characters aren't nearly as developed, & the writing doesn't even come close.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting &amp; Awesome! This game will keep you from being bored! I can't put it down since I've downloaded it!
B00915G6SU|5.0|A great show. I have a all eight seasons. I enjoy watching them over again. A awesome series. All the actors are awesome.
0062255657|5.0|I gave it to my daughter for her birthday and she says it's the best book she has read read all year.  The author is amazing.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This app is awesome but it's kind of confusing. I mean like it's not that loud and well I'm not saying it's bad it's just loud. Other than that it's awesomely awesome. The app is a dollar but it's worth your money.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Please I need this app for my study of Jehovah's word ...I am so excited to have this on my kindle ...I can taste it ....thank you brothers for putting this app out for all of us to enjoy God's word...
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is a awesome series. Stephen King is awesome. I love anything and everything Stephen King. I have all three seasons and they are all awesome.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I cannot believe how well this works! To be honest I didn't believe it would work so well but I was wrong! It does exactly what it is supposed to do. My kindle runs much nicer now and has lots more space. Definitely a great find!!!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|A first-rate historical novel. I enjoyed it immensely. There is a lot here for Bond fans and World War 2 enthusiasts. A great read. Recommended.
0684803356|2.0|Trite, by the numbers love story with spectacularly banal romantic dialogue.  The author doesn't bother with much setting or character development.  The two lead characters are two dimensional, with the girl too good to be true.<br /><br />  He drinks on practically every page:  Wine, beer, cognac, vermouth, brandy, whiskey and soda; morning, noon or night.<br /><br />  It's hard to imagine what anyone thinks is so great about this book.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Love the game been playing for months. They have tons of issues with there server connecting lately.  It bugs me so much when I just wanna relax and play. I'll start playing and it just shuts its self out of the app. When I come back everything I've done is not there anymore.  Seems like one day it's ok the next not. You try to write to the company and you find yourself jumping through hoops just to let them know the issue. They shouldn't need a bunch of info from my acct just to hear about there messed up servers. I hope this is fixed soon or I'm done. I shouldn't feel aggravated when I play I should  be able to kill in peace but this is not the case. So I'll put it out here on the review maybe that will get there att.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was full of twists and turns.  It was a story of normal people's lives that were intertwined, although they were not aware of it. Sort of a 'six degrees of separation. The epilogue was outstanding.  Absolutely LOVED it!
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|The mini games are challenging enough and the plot moves well enough, but it could've been more interesting, more plot development definitely would've made the game better all around....
B0095VPBM2|5.0|It runs fast, cool, and quiet.  Great price for cpu with fan included.  I'm not a gamer, so the built-in graphics is great for my needs.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Just as good as the first. Another thing to blow my mind. The author couldn't have done a better job with the creation of these masterpieces.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|I hated Jack's music the first time I heard it, banana pancakes *cringe* A couple weeks later, I listened to that same song again and started to really like it. Now, I've listened to everything he's ever done and really dig it. This album is no exception. Washing Dishes is probably the catchiest song he's ever written. I Got You and Home are great if you have a soul. Tape Deck is a fun song about Jack's musical roots. Those are the standouts to me, but it's all good.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|You are on of my favorite authors. I wish I could  meet you but I know can't. This book was my second favorite books that I have read by all authors.
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|Let me be the one to advise you to purchase the cd for the download code for DTS headphone listening.  It is fantastic and was available on Man of Steel as well.  You will need the Z+ app for your smartphone/notepad device but it's worth the trouble. Everyone else has reviewed the music and i have nothing to add except i am a huge Formula 1 fan and have been for 20 years so i have nothing but good things to say about the film and the music. Thanks to Ron Howard and Hans Zimmer for giving me a gift i never expected in a country that is largely oblivious to the joys of Grand Prix motor racing
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I own a Withings scale and really liked this product as well, at least in terms of its accuracy.<br />However, within two months of owning and and using it daily I have noticed a few things that are frustrating to say the least:<br /><br />1) the thing intermittently would not sync and required a \\"factory reset\\" on a couple occasions, thereby losing all of the data that hadn't been uploaded yet.<br />2) the battery in no way lasts 2 weeks, it is more like 3-4 days before needing to be recharged.<br /><br />But the major factor for a one-star review is:<br /><br />3) A piece chipped off of the Pulse. It was dropped indoors a few weeks prior, but one day,it just chipped. It is ordinarily kept in a dedicated pocket in my pants ( no keys, change,etc).<br />I emailed their CS along with a picture of the Pulse and wondered if they would replace it, and got a terse email stating that they would not replace it. Superglue worked, but I am thinking that I may not be so lucky with the next \\"chip.\\"<br /><br />Again, I like the functionality of the product, but the above issues, particularly the poor customer service for the lack of durability, leave a lot to be desired.
B002C949KE|3.0|I think it's definitely worth reading. It's educational, Insightful And I could relate to several scenarios in my own life. I found it to be a well-written book.
B000SEFNMS|1.0|I really hated this book. It was a required reading for one of my classes. It is by far the most boring book I have ever read and the author's writing style is very erratic. Will not be reading his other books.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|the movie was entertaining but if you are looking for the &#34;I am the law&#34; style. this is not it.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Well my 11 YO DD loves this CD and we're already preordering their new CD. Highly recommend if you have a 1D loving kiddo as I do.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It's small, it's fast and it's reasonable price charger for my iPhone 4S. This is the third car charger I have and this is the best.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|The only book I did not like in this series was mocking jay. It's just her complaining all the time
B007SGM084|5.0|Fantastic storyline. You can't put the book down. It keeps you reading and puts you in grays world. I was upset when I was done
B0026PW67W|5.0|This was very good but we wish that they would have given you some kind vanishing ink or hidden ink to make the map come to life...
B003BKZW7C|5.0|I really associated with the characters. They took me back to the beauty of my childhood and the power of imagination and strength of the love felt in those friendships. Fun, exciting and powerful storylines.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Not that good of a game. Updates take forever. Very boring and Isn't worth the money.  Warning be warned that this app allows you to buy stuff in game.
0385486804|5.0|Ahhh heck, as someone who has a fierce work ethic and responsibility gene - I dream of chucking it all and hitting the road....particularly when my pragmatic side is in conflict with the idealist dreamer side - not in some wacko sort of way but simply because there are times when I just want to step off the hamster wheel and do only fun stuff.  LOL.<br /><br />Through Krakauer's eyes, I got a glimpse of what this might look like via the story of Christopher McCandless.  While his story ended in his death, I found the possibility of just moving and staying in a rather serendipitous way rather exciting.  More difficult to reconcile was McCandless' capacity to walk away from family and friends without looking back.  This is an aspect of him that I wonder about - how was this possible?
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish...the twisting plot was quite clever.  The characters were great.  Interesting to see how all the flashbacks came together.<br />It was fast paced and a good mystery!  Great read and highly recommend.  New author for me so I'm now checking out more......
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As I have lived in England I  enjoyed seeing a look into the Abbey and the family.  The commentary  explaining the Abbey and all the lifestyle of the  &#34;family&#34; was engrossing.  I stayed up many nights to watch ..
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Hoped that this was a substitute for more expensive streaming products, so I was disappointed that it didn't meet those expectations.<br />Will use it on the kid's TV to get Netflix....
1416583432|3.0|A dog adopted us two years ago.  I've always been a cat person, not anti-dog but a job with travel warrants a realistic assessment of what's possible when it comes to living with a pet.  So Lovee Boy adopted us, showed up on the property one day and then just stayed. He had been abused and walked around tail between his legs and head down - his whole demeanor reflected a down trodden spirit that broke my heart.  He wouldn't let us near him and touching was out of the question.  So sitting on the patio, it's 115 degrees, Dog walks by and we say - we either have to call the pound or accept this dog into our family - it's cruel for him to not have food.  We knew if we called the pound that he would be euthanized given his anti-social stance.  So we basically accepted him into our family and began the process of meeting him and introducing ourselves.  Three months later - he finally let me stroke his chin.  Today he comes in the house, loves hugs, and touch is no longer a bad thing.<br /><br />I've learned a lot about people by getting to know Lovee.  Trust is a precious thing and once sufficiently damaged such that walls come up....you have to earn trust and even then the walls remain.  You have to love people enough to stay (trust restoration takes time) and be consistent in loving them even when they withdraw due to their fear.<br /><br />Inside of a Dog expanded my understanding about dogs, how they communicate, and how they interact.<br /><br />3 star review - I gave this book 3 stars due to the writing and organization.  I found myself skimming a lot and wishing the key observations were more overtly presented so I didn't have to dig to figure out what the point was.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I usually read \\"historical fiction\\", but if this HAD been fiction, people would say the author had an overly active imagination. What great stuff this book contains, and what great writing! I now have a stack of Bryson's other books, and I look forward to reading them. I wish the history books used by schools were like this (do they still teach history?).
B001BPJJ9G|3.0|The first half of this movie is colorful and entertaining.  After that, the plot fizzles out and the dialogue seems improvised.  The child actress is talented, but half her dialogue is impossible to understand.  The photography is beautiful, but without a coherent script this just devolves into another pretentious artsy movie.  The animated sequence was a waste of time.  Ambitious but disappointing.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|Hello, Dolly! Barbara's voice has aged, but is still perfection to my ears. She nails every one of these classics with laid back, jazzy productions that showcase her voice rather than distract from it. \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" literally took my breath away, but even the less obvious choices like \\"I Remember\\" and \\"A Christmas Love Song\\" are note-worthy highlights.<br /><br />\\"Silent Night\\" is one of the best renditions you'll find.<br /><br />\\"My Favorite Things\\" is given an ultra-lounge rendition that make the lyrics feel mature and wise. Gorgeous.<br /><br />\\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" - I've always been bored by this song, but Barbara makes it sound like butter. LOVE it.<br /><br />OVERALL: 16 tracks and, if I'm in a bad mood, I'll say I didn't like two of them. The rest are AMAZING. The productions are traditional with a jazzy wintry simplicity that is exactly what a Christmas song should be. You will DEFINITELY want to add this album to your '13 Holiday Playlist.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|Michael Connelly can be depended on to bring great mystery novels that leave one wanting more. He's become one of my favorite authors.
B001DF68MA|2.0|I have a Specialized bicycle and the seat has a lever to use for quick seat height adjustment. Due to the lever, the bike seat attachment bar would not fit around it.  Very disappointed.  Didn't have a chance to use it at all.  The plastic seemed a little cheap and light, but I really can't comment on the sturdiness of it since I never was able to put it on my bike and use it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|lots of fun to play and fast moving!! Fun for young and old alike. Goals to lead you upward in levels. Great fun!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works great!  Cleaned up all my junk and freed up space so I can be more productive. Highly recommend this app.
B000TEUSJK|1.0|I was stunned at the pornographic nature of this film.  I'm not naïve -- I'm almost 80 years old! -- but this film was simply disgusting.  I was afraid my grown daughters would see it in my home, so I wrapped it up and put it in the garbage!!!
B001V82OK4|5.0|One of the best albums of all time don't think twice buy it you wont regret it its amazing !!
B004XVMCMQ|1.0|What a piece of trash. The writer or writers twisted her words to make \\"Mansfield Park\\" into a sordid R-rated soap opera. Naked bodies caught in the act in a bedroom, the father (can't remember names) a respectable gentleman became a leering dirty-old-man with sweaty forehead who used and owned slaves in Antigua. Fanny brought his opium addicted wife her daily potion of dope that put her into a bleary-eyed daze. Brother William was left out entirely and sweet little Fanny Price became a feisty in-you-face 20th-century feminist. Kind religious Edmund made excuses for his father using and owning slaves. The English love to distain Hollywood and these writers and producers and director have become what they ridicule, only worse. They should be ashamed of themselves, on a par with- Americans burning the flag.<br /><br />I read an article in the 1950's about Vladimir Nabokov the author of \\"Lolita\\" who was from Poland and became a professor of English Literature in one of the Ivy League Women's colleges. He said he considered Jane Austen to be the best writer of English fiction he had ever read. How could he have imagined that \\"Mansfield Park\\" would be changed in character to resemble something he would have written himself. If you are a Jane Austen admirer, do NOT buy this dvd.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works awesome. Interface is intuitive and easy to use. Numbers are big and easy too see.Functions work very well. Great for anyone to have on their phone.

B001EBV0NU|5.0|I LOVE THIS COMEDY AND THE GREAT CAST THAT PLAYED IN IT. IT HAS THIS OLD COUNTRY SONG THAT IS PLAYED AND ENDS UP BEING THE WEAPON TO ATTACK THE MARTIANS. IF YOU HAVE A SINCE OF HUMOR , AND LIKE TO LAUGH, IT'S WORTH WATCHING.

B005V5WBFG|1.0|I just renewed my PC and Laptop for 2014 and paid almost $50.00 and I was told by one of your reps. that it was cost me another $29 to get McAfee on my Kindle Fire.  I've had McAfee for at least 4 years and would think I would be able to add the Kindle to a package. The first time I called one of your reps, I was told that McAfee does not cover Kindle Fires and than I turn on the Kindle and McAfee is on it for a 30 day free trial.  I am checking Norton and if they can give me a package for all three for a better price I'll be contacting you for a refund.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Action filled, fast paced book set in the future regarding human intensions and behaviors.  This book could and should replace any number of forgettable standard novels from high school or college course work.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was a really entertaining book. It contains an interesting comparison with the Roman Empire. I definitely recommend it. Light reading.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Absolutely brilliantly written show! I just love the chemistry between the actors and the story lines are awesome i can't say enough about how much i love this show
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock, I haven't had a single issue with it on my 2nd gen kindle fire.  There are many nice features like waking up to selected music.  Alarm also fades in and gets louder until you wake up and dismiss it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Quite a surprise ending. Shocker,,<br />I highly recommend to people who like a good fast read and a thriller.... What are some of some of the other books mr landau has written?
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Great book to read and discover the real cooking that goes on inside the kitchen. Dark humor but humor overall.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Written so that the story held your interest while using events in recent history to make the tales even more interesting.<br />Would love to read a sequel.

B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I got completely caught up in this book from the beginning. Each turn of the page makes you curious as to what will happen next. A truly wonderful read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great family movie, I got it so we can watch whenever we need a laugh or need something fun to do as a family.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book and was sad when it ended. It was too short. I wanted it to be epic. This book was a terrific sequel to the Shining. It was done much better than Black House, the sequel to the Talisman. My only complaint is the ending. It felt rushed and anticlimactic. The entire book was building up to some great battle with great pain that really didn't happen. Otherwise it's a book I would happily read again and suggest to others. I loved it.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|got the mouse today, shipping was pretty fast, ordered ir on sunday and got it this morning tuesday oct 8.. when i open the package, the box seems like somebody opened it before, when i unboxed the mouse, the instruction manual cover was all scratched, so i definitely  assume it was opened. also the mouse left click button is kinda scratched on the edge...
B00915G6MG|4.0|Nothing wrong with the quality of the DVD's and of course the content is awesome.<br /><br />The reason I only gave this season a 4 is because of the packaging. Seasons 7, 8, 9 packaging is compact and I don't have to worry about the thin outside jacket breaking down and 3 sets of disks falling out of Seasons 1-6 and now 10. I thought someone got smart at the end of the series.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|of  mindless  funny. This  fits  the bill. Not  going  to go into a  long spiel about it this  movie. Light hearted  ADULT language  humor..
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is entertaining, revealing, and satisfying. Aslan manages to artfully string together source material on the historical - not mythical - Jesus that I imagine was very difficult to find and decipher. The three parts tell this the controversial narrative of Jesus's life in a way thy captures the imagination and compels the reader to learn more about the context and theater in which Jesus operated.

B00B22ASUM|4.0|Story is interesting, but not the super feel good you may expect. I found the story edgy.

1451696191|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is a mesmerizing book, but isn't everyone. There are many graphic scenes that deal with difficult issues; ones that aren't appropriate for certain ages or could make some feel uncomfortable. If adult content makes you queasy then you definitely won't enjoy this book. There are difficult scenes that deal with rape, molestation, suicide, and alienation. There's also quite a bit of swearing and drug use. However, this book has marvelous qualities that make it one of the best influential books of all time.<br /><br />Written in a diary style, the young Protagonist Charlie starts his first year of high school. He is extremely withdrawn and disliked by his peers for no apparent reason. Quickly into the book the reader learns that his only friend committed suicide which made Charlie spiral into a deep hole of depression and anger. Early on in Charlie's freshman year he meets a senior named Patrick, and his stepsister Sam. Patrick and Sam reach out to him in an unforgettable way, taking him under their wings, and making him forget his saddens for a while. For once Charlie feels like he belongs, and it's a beautiful sight for the reader.<br /><br />As Charlie narrates the story the reader witnesses his dynamic family, particularly his sister whom the reader sometimes hates but sometimes loves.  A big barrier Charlie deals with is not only having a feeling of belonging at school or with his peers, but at home as well.<br /><br />This story is a beautiful tale of a boy who is growing up into a remarkable individual. His thoughts are pure, innocent, and unforgettable. And if you let it, this book will change your life. It's so much more than a book with a few graphic parts, but it deals with issues that are more common than we'd like to think. It's eye opening, riveting, emotional, and flawless.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This hidden object game is great. You are given several different options, plenty of levels, and variety without paying for anything. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden object games.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is truly amazing!! I don't read much because I can fine books that interest me enough, but this one sure does. As many of you know, teenagers make it out to be so much more provocative than it actually is. It is more of a love story than a porn. It is absolutely spectacular. I strongly suggest reading it.
B0033H7VI6|3.0|The quality of the materials you are getting is great for the price. However, I feel as though the corners that were cut to maintain the low price were in the quality of the manufacturing.<br /><br />My biggest (and only) issue with this product is the fact that the blade grind is very uneven. One side of the blade is cut at an entirely different angle than the other. I exchanged this product once already hoping that it was just a fluke QC error but the new blade came in with the same issue but to a slightly lesser extent. I am tempted to return it again but I don't know that it is worth the trouble.<br /><br />I had read that other users had experience the same problem but for the price I thought I would take the risk. In the end, I will probably have it professionally sharpened in an attempt to fix the grind, thus offsetting any savings I was hoping to obtain through this purchase.<br /><br />The only other negative thing to mention about this blade is the plastic handle not aligning perfectly with the tang in various places along the blade. This does not hamper performance in the slightest but for those looking for cosmetic perfection, it may be something to consider.<br /><br />While I am slightly disappointed, for the price, this is still a very durable knife. Many users will not notice or care but for those looking to optimize their equipment and take care of it in the best manner possible will want to factor all of this into their decision making and equipment maintenance.
0345803485|2.0|I had high hopes for this book but it just didn't keep my attention and was a bit too sophomoric as well as sexist. I could not keep my eyes open and that is when I figured it was time to close up the book on this Kindle book buy. I only made it through about 1/4 or so of the book. I suppose if it was the only book and I was stranded on an island with no other interruptions, I'd likely finish reading it.

B00BCCE3VM|5.0|Canadian pianist Jan Lisiecki is now 18 years old and while that is not as young as some of his contemporaries it is still rather amazing that he has such command of his instrument. In recital as well as on recording he has found the balance between technical finesse and finding the soaring melodic lines that flood these Chopin virtuosic &Eacute;tudes. This is the second Deutsche Grammophon release from the young Canadian pianist, and his first-ever studio recital album, which he recorded in the famous Koerner Hall of the Music Conservatory in Toronto.<br /><br />Chopin's &Eacute;tudes are among the most challenging and evocative pieces of all the works in the piano repertoire. In offering both opus 10 and 0pus 25 on one release we are afforded the pleasure of variety Chopin bestowed on these favorites. Lisiecki seems to innately understand how to manage the leading line with the accompanying voices. But too many words, here. Just add this magnificent album to your library and spend hours of discovery at how this young giant brings it al together. Grady Harp, October 13
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I have loved this classic for years, and seem to enjoy different aspects each time I read it.  I enjoy the romance, reading a novel from a different time, and this time I particularly enjoyed Marmee's character and the wise words she had for her girls.

B000MD9UJC|4.0|This device replaces the original end cap and front end assembly of the Mini MAG Light.  The parts are all plastic, not aluminum as the original parts.  The difference in the precision of the manufacturing tolerance is immediately obvious.  But black is black so you will not notice in the assembled flashlight.  The switch on the end cap replaces the twist switch on the front end.  The twist beam adjuster still works.  I will be purchasing two more for my other Mini MAGs.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Let me start by saying that I don't love everything by Stephen King.  Having said that, his best books are the ones that I can't put down. I used to crush through them, delirious with joy at the end of the journey.  Some of the others, I would start and not finish.  This is one of his best. But instead of crushing through, I slowed down.  I didn't want it to end.  It is that good.<br />  The story is about how one person deals with severe mental trauma. The guilt, shame and loss and, of course, dealing with what might be on the other side.  It is also about the choices made and dealing with the outcome.  Stephen King's books may contain a lot of weird stuff, but at their heart, they are about what it means to be human.  I love that about his storys.<br /> Don't hesitate to get this one.  It burns as bright as his  best. Thank your Mr. King!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A very well written book.  The characters were real. Very emotional. A secret I did not expect.  A book you can't put down.
B001R6AW18|5.0|Always loved this. My Dad and I always watched when The Million Dollar Movie showed it. On TV mid sixty' 60s. My Dad and I were dysfunctional but this, Mighty Joe Young, and The Godzilla movies we both connected. The final line was beautifully delivered.'Twas beauty that killed the beast&#34;
1478952725|5.0|When I started reading this book at a bookstore in Seattle International Airport, I didn't have much to expect, except one rave review I read while on airplane flying into SEATAC.<br /><br />The book, however, quickly grabbed my attention. And I had no choice but to finish it in one go.<br /><br />So here I am, completely mind-blown, and ready to recommend this book to anybody, including my friends, family and relatives.<br /><br />Why is this book so mind-blowing? Here I attempt to jot down a few points:<br /><br />(a) The language is simple and persuasive. It does not contain intricate details, formulas, or boring jargons.<br />(b) The author never abuses the potential critics of his book. He is well-aware that the topic is all too controversial.<br />(c) The book relies on solid numerical and statistical facts, rather than drawing conclusions out of thin air.<br />(d) The book conveys very well what it has meant to say, and perhaps even more importantly, what it has NOT meant to say.<br />(e) The author not only has a solid command over the field he is talking about, but he is distinguished by his sensitivity to minute details and an extensive array of footnotes.<br /><br />I would not comment on the content of the book. It is up for the readers to figure it out. Some things are better left unsaid. See it for yourself. ;-)<br /><br />Some minor points on how the book could have been made better:<br /><br />(a) There are some typos. Some proofreading can be of good use here.<br />(b) Although it is true that Davids come up again and again in history, it might be worth pointing out why Goliaths became Goliaths in the very first place. They probably had also started as Davids. :)<br />(c) While extremely important and timely, I found the analysis of academic selection (\\"choice of schools\\") somewhat lacking in substance. It would have been better, I guess, to also include a discussion on why Goliaths in academic institutions ended up being in the top. Is it just because they have a superior set of academics? A superior set of students? A superior set of staff? A combination of all these? Or something else? Something completely different?<br />(d) The book could be expanded to include more cases of Davids and Goliaths - but I'd leave it to Gladwell to perhaps ponder the idea of a potential second volume of this excellent book.<br /><br />Thanks to Malcolm Gladwell for writing such an amazing piece. I'd definitely be looking up for his next production.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike did a great job of explaining basic principles of building muscle and losing fat. Many of us have the goal of achieving a great physique, but there is just too much contradictory information out there about how to actually do that. BLS is a straight-forward read, no BS or fairytales or bro-science - just plain facts. And I loved it for that!<br /><br />I've decided to follow the training program laid out in the book to the last rep. On the other hand, I've decided to go with a bit different nutritional regime than the one Mike proposes in BLS. I've tried Intermittent Fasting a couple of months before learning about this book and I fell in love with it immediately! IF works so well for me, I feel awesome and I'm not changing it for the world. I'm sure Mike would approve ;)<br /><br />And while the way you eat is something you can, and probably should, experiment with and try to find something that will work the best for you specifically, working out is a totally different beast. Even if for nothing else, BLS will always have a special place on my bookshelf for these chapters alone.<br /><br />I could write a lot more about Bigger Leaner Stronger, but I will just say this - get it and read it, especially if you're a novice in the world of fitness and it all seems way too complex. After reading BLS you'll be ready to hit the weights and shed the fat in no time! You will learn a lot and find out that getting to look and feel better is not such a complex endeavour after all, at least not when you're armed with all this knowledge.<br /><br />And if you're ever stuck, just reach for Mike on one of many social networks he's active on, or his website. He always responds to questions and really cares about your success!

0865478007|1.0|How could anyone publish a book full of lies and misinterpret truth.  Ben is either a big liar or simply stupid enough to write the book.  There are lies in every page.  Just an example in the very first page: \\"85 % of the industry-funded sudies were positives\\".  The truth is 1) for new molecule entity, the success rate in industry is between 5% to 10 %.  The 85% positives rate mostly due to the industry conduct clincical trials for market drugs for new indications.  Because the safty concern from the general public, pharmaceutical industry are very conserve about the innovation, they only test known drugs for well known indications.  As the result, there are lots of me-too drugs, instead of first in class one to meet the needs from patients.
B009X01ELC|5.0|nice looking, well-constructed and nicely padded. Very flexible design --  The ability to use as a stand in both horizontal and vertical positions makes this useful when watching videos or when reading. The adjustable angle is also a nice feature to have.

B001974DG0|4.0|I was glad I got this one.  I remember the movie from years ago and was hesitant to get this one.  I know movies are always different, but they tend to be along the same lines as the book.<br />Nope.<br />Only thing they share are names, and dog/monster thing.  Plot was different and made me keep turning the pages. Made me want to go out and buy a dog!<br />Good characters, suspense, different plot, and just a well done story.<br />Good for people wanting sci fi without tons of gore.<br />Recommend for a first time Dean Koontz reader.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This kit was an amazing buy for under $25.  At most stores it was selling for $90 almost.  It will make a wonderful Christmas gift for my family as it was a movie we went to together in high school one snowy day in New York.  The items in the box besides the DVD are special and add to the wonderful memories of the movie and the people involved.

B002QW7ALM|1.0|I hate this movie, this must be one of those new Sci-Fi flicks I just don't get into. I am into good sci-fi movies like Alien, Star Wars, Star Trek, Scanners, ETC.. I just didn't get into this at all, it was boring, stupid, and a waste of my time. I bought it because I heard good things about it, but I need to be more cautious on others reviews. The thing that hurts worse is I had credit and I wasted 6 bucks on it. I did find someone who took it off my hands for a lesser price.<br /><br />THX,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
1476727651|2.0|I thought this books would be as scary or more scary than The Shining. I was wrong. It's not scary at all.<br /><br />It's twice as long as it needs to be and can be quite boring at times, especially with the AA stuff.<br /><br />The half-sister thing at the end was a huge cop-out. That would have been better left out. Didn't seem like a typical King convention.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|It seems the developer is using this as a gateway to his or her other apps.  There's actually very little here of interest other than it is an attractive application.<br /><br />The Weather Underground app is so far superior that there's just no comparison.  Plus, with the WU app, I get the benefit of my premium membership.<br /><br />With this app, you get (from left to right)<br /> > Simple Settings<br /> > Location<br /> > Current Conditions<br /> > Hourly Forecast<br /> > 5-Day Forecast<br /> > ADVERTISEMENTS for other apps, with NO WAY to disable this.<br /><br />Plus, the app uses FLURRY ANALYTICS.  I really don't want Flurry to have my GPS coordinates, thank-you-very-much.<br /><br />There is no radar, no advanced weather, no apparent warning system, and it is a full-screen only app.<br /><br />This one gets a one-way trip to the uninstall bin, as there's no value for me here.<br /><br />Definitely NOT worth $1.99, or even 99-cents!
B00BB8VRPM|5.0|this movie is emotional, heartwarming and sad.  I could write more, but you should watch it yourself and I really believe you will like it

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this because I have a digital camcorder, and I back up all my video on a hard drive. I was hoping to have a way to go through my archives and play back video on my television easily, basically a wireless HDMI cable. Although this is possible, it's not really as easy as I had hoped. First, you can only play back video through the Chrome browser, not my first choice for playing video. Second the video format from the camcorder doesn't work in Chrome, so I have to convert it to some other format first. Then when I do have a format that works it's not the smoothest streaming video. That being said, it was $35, so I'm sure that I'll find some use for it that will make it worth the money, and who knows they may have some updates that will improve the use of this. But for now I'll probably just continue viewing video on my computer screen.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This app is ok but a little hard to play. But I will keep trying it for now on my tablet.

B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Oh my oh my it's about time Brian \\"Head\\" Welch made a return to the band that simply changed the metal scene in the early 90's and 2000's. Personally for me KoRn completely changed my taste in music, and opened my ears to dozens and dozens of bands I've grown to love today. This album just brings that heavy element KoRn was missing for all these years. Munky did a really good job on the 4 albums without head, but honestly I only really enjoyed about 5-6 tracks off See You On The Other Side and KoRn III - Remember Who You Are. Growing up with KoRn and being in love with their first 6 albums, I always kept on wanting more on the last 4 albums. This album ABSOLUTELY delivers what KoRn should sound like.<br /><br />This might be my favorite album lyrically and instrumentally for these guys. It's obvious the maturity process with Head doing his amazing solo work, Munky being on his own really molded together well, almost like Head was just on a short hiatus. Jonathan's lyrics and vocals are beyond excellent on this album. Fieldy's bass as well seems to come back to life on this album as well. With the exception of Korn III I sware I had to be like ohh there's his bass! WTF it was so powerful and epic on Take A Look In The Mirror, then almost just disbanded the sound onward. If you have been a KoRn fan for years I assure you will not regret picking up this album. The deluxe is the way to go because you get 2 extra kick ass tracks and an hour documentary covering Head's return and his reasoning, recording sessions of songs, and a large background of the reconciliation of Head!!<br /><br />I'm getting really tired of people saying it sounds like Untouchables or Follow the Leader. No actually it doesn't AT ALL, none of Korn's albums have EVER sounded the same with the exception of their first 2. That in itself is what makes KoRn so badass and still my favorite band to date. KoRn fans you MUST pick up this album!! If I can only figure out how to redeem my free t-shirt accesscode that came with the album haha<br /><br />Personal favorites from album:<br /><br />Mass Hysteria<br />Lullaby For a Sadist<br />Tell Me What You Want<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I'm sure it's a great device for those that can use it. I was not able to hook it up/be recognized by the latest Netgear router. Had no problems hooking up my other devices, laptops, Roku players, etc. But &#34;no cigar&#34; with the Chromecast.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Somehow, when they first released an album, I managed to miss Mumford & Sons. I partly blame it on the age of digital music, when you can select tracks to listen to and skip those you don't want to hear. This, plus the fact that I generally listen to my own songs while on my daily commute, meant that this band escaped me. However, I did catch Mumford & Sons when \\"Babel\\" was released in 2012, and I am among the millions of new devotees.<br /><br />I didn't quite know what to expect the first time I heard this album, but it's quickly earned a spot on my rotation in the car. Yes, some of the songs do sound alike. (I attribute that fact that, for the most part, the music I'm used to doesn't feature banjos.) However, despite a similar sound and message (many songs are either about a breakup or difficulties in a relationship), they are each different enough to warrant my attention.<br /><br />The highlight of the record is, certainly, 'I Will Wait'. Featuring an infectious intro and driving chorus, it's easy to learn and sing along to. Frankly, this one has \\"hit\\" written all over it. Other top tunes are the sweeping 'Holland Road' (which, due to its ending, I may like better than 'I Will Wait'), the more folksy-yet-rocky 'Hopeless Wanderer', pop-ish title track 'Babel', and the anthemic 'Lover of the Light'. Admittedly, toward the second half of the album, things slow down a bit. I have found myself skipping 'Reminder' because it simply doesn't move enough to really grab me, though it's not a bad track and a nice change from what precedes it.<br /><br />I once described to a friend that Mumford & Sons has capitalized on the folk-meets-country-meets-pirate sound, and I truly can't find a better way to put it. They have created a unique, organic blend in an era of music that rewards and promotes electronica and digital enhancements. It's a refreshing change to see some type of folk rock make it back onto the mainstream scene, if only for a change of pace.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Who couldn't love this movie!  It is a classic and watching it should be a part of anyone's Holiday Festivities.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Here is a great app for getting the weather for your specific location.  I use it every day.  Built in Google Maps Weather Radar is just great!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|If you love Sound of Music, you just love it. Although the movie deviates some from the real characters, it is a true story that happened to the Vonn Trapp family in Austria during WWII.  Love, family, music all brought together by a nun who is sent by the Convent to care for children of a widower. The nun Maria finds that God has more in store for her than being a nun.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|The title of my review is saying a lot. I know that. But it is true. I am a huge fan of comics and super hero movies. All of them. Even Elektra and Daredevil. That being said, I can watch X-Men Origins Wolverine, but I really dislike that movie. I love the Avengers, and in my opinion Man of Steel was a lot better than Avengers. The formula for Avengers was awesome but predictable. World needs heroes, heroes clash, heroes make up, heroes save the world. And while Man of Steel and Avengers are two different types of movies, the formula for man of Steel made things unpredictable. MoS was gritty, sort of dark, with alot of destruction that would come from gods fighting on Earth.<br /><br />Many people complained about the death and destruction in Mos. I say this, it was realistic. Superman had just learned who he was and then his ancestors descend on Earth. A ship full of Supermen and women. I know when watching a Justice League cartoon, and we see Superman punch someone through buildings, we all have said, I wish a Superman movie could be like that. Well, now we have it.<br /><br />People complained about the ending. What Superman did. If you don't know, you will and it will be amazing. And when you do see it, try to understand that this is the first event in Superman's life were he is faced with anything. He makes mistakes just like a young Batman would, only when Superman makes mistakes, buildings are flattened and millions die. AS his life progresses, I bet he will adopt a personality much like the Superman we all know and love.<br /><br />People found plot holes, well not so much plot holes, just scientific inaccuracies. Like Lois falling from a black hole when everything around her is being sucked in. And there was this machine that the military had to transport, but people were up in arms saying, why couldn't Superman do it for them? To these folks I say just enjoy a movie about an alien who can fly, shoot fire out his eyes, basically do anything, and stop worrying about dumb stuff. And stop trying to be scientists. It's like all these years of Stargate SG1, Star Trek, and Doctor Who, people are all of a sudden experts.
B00846REIS|5.0|Although this book is similar to Fifty Shades of Gray, it is much better written and, so far, more believable.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I think that this is the best book yet. I liked to learn about what happens to Clary and Jace. This book is full of adventure and mystery, and I would recommend this book to whoever likes those things. This book is great!
B000QJM8Z0|4.0|For this and other reviews please visit my blog, Zemfirka Blogs... {[...]<br /><br />In honor of the soon-to-be-released third installment in the Bridget Jones series, I thought I'd share a few thoughts on Bridget and her adventures as our favorite singleton.<br /><br />  MONDAY 6 MARCH<br /><br />  124 lbs. (v.v.g.--have realized secret of dieting is not weighing oneself).<br /><br />  Can officially confirm that the way to a man's heart these days is not through beauty, food, sex or alluringness of character, but merely the ability to seem not very interested in him.<br /><br />Bridget Jones's Diary (p. 73).<br /><br />It is only last year that I've finally discovered and read the Bridget Jones novels. I've first encountered Bridget as portrayed by Renée Zellweger in the movies of the same name, which I sincerely enjoyed. So I thought I'd give it a try, to see whether I liked the original as much as the film version of our heroine - Bridget Jones - and to my surprise I did. Helen Fielding has a talent for translating humor onto the pages of her novels, the situations and shenanigans that ensue are often laugh-out-loud funny, but yet, quite relatable and that's what made these books and subsequent movies notable and loved.<br /><br />Coming to this book franchise after having watched the movies first, I must admit I didn't expect a drastic difference, but where the first movie closely followed events of the first novel, the second adapted text liberally. And while The Edge of Reason was vastly different from the film, I found myself enjoying the book a great deal more, as often is the case.<br /><br />Bridget is always at the epicenter of a self-made crisis, whether it is her struggles with weight, her attempts at quitting smoking, or her relations with men, there is always something going on with Bridget. Complete with a great cast of characters: the swoon-worthy barrister, Mark Darcy, Bridget's ever-helpful circle of friends, her mum and dad, and the love-to-hate-him Daniel Cleaver, you sure to find yourself entertained by these novels. There are a great number of funny scenes and situations throughout both books. And the ever-popular Colin Firth interview is worth a read. Better yet was Bridget's overall narration style, or rather \\"diary entries.\\" Yes, she is far from perfect, and might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but she is not without charm.<br /><br />  SATURDAY 19 JULY<br /><br />  129 lbs. (why? On bikini-purchase day, why?), confusing thoughts about Daniel: too many, bikini bottoms fitted into 1, bikini tops fitted into: half, rude thoughts about Prince William 22, no. of times wrote \\"Prince William and his lovely date Miss Bridget Jones at Ascot\\" on Hello! magazine 7.<br /><br />  6:30 p.m. Bloody, bloody, bloody. Have spent all day in changing rooms of Oxford Street trying to squeeze my breasts into bikini tops designed for people with breasts either arranged one on top of the other in the center of their chests or one under each arm, with the harsh downlighting making me look like River Café frittata.<br /><br />Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (pp. 226-227).<br /><br />So, are you a fellow Bridget Jones lover? I'm sure you all have seen those movies, and secretly enjoyed the stories portrayed. Then, why not give these books a whirl as well? I enjoyed reading these books myself and would recommend it to anyone wanting a fun and light read.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Hard but really challenging takes a while to get your levels up because you can only have so many turns before you have to wait but lots of fun
B009P3PQEI|5.0|If you are seeking the ultimate in sound quality, you will be very pleased with the reproduction of this LP by Friday Music.  My turntable / cartridge is circa £7,500, and this LP just sounds great.  Re-mastered from first generation tapes makes all the difference.  The sound is far superior to the original 1957 UK first pressing.  The songs deliver feeling and emotion, and show Elvis at his best.  Highly recommended!
B003VANOFY|5.0|It's just a great headset. Mic is on the left side. Everything works 100%, no problems at all so far. The USB stick has a nice little light indicating whether it's active or not. The sounds is awesome! It also block the ambient noise quite well. Also, the whole headset is pretty robust and not too heavy, but defiitely heavier than the Logitech H800.

159463176X|5.0|I can't say enough about how much this work truly impacted me.  I enjoyed Hosseini's previous novels, but this is his crowning achievement.  Epic in scale, like A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner, this work differs in terms of emotional resonance and truly breathtaking, impressively complex structure of this novel.  It's a novel that you won't quickly forget, but you will be flipping the pages by, wanting more and more, until sadly, it has to end.  I will not divulge any spoilers, which I find terribly hazardous in reading reviews, but will just express that this is why novels are written.  Hosseini is able to transport you to another time and place, to help you better understand people and cultures different from your own, to make you continue thinking and processing what you've read for months (years) later, to want to read again and again to find new details to relish....  It is sad, wrenching, humane, moving, harrowing, epic, beautiful....

B004QL7K70|5.0|I would love to get like them. I'd love to go to a party like this. It is honestly one of my favorite movies.
B004JHYRAE|5.0|An excellent book for the introduction to ethical non-monogamy. Clearly and kindly written without any proselytizing.<br />Whatever else, it will get you thinking and with any luck open your horizons to at least explore and research other options for conducting relationships than the normative 1+1=1 way of doing things.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about Nikola Tesla. It was well written and highly informative. Sean Patrick gives a very detailed account of Tesla's  life and how he transformed the world with his many inventions.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A sweet story with a good ending.  A pleasure to read something that is warm and tender rather than a story full of foul language and violence.

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|From the reviews I've read, Brandon Sanderson is one amazing author. Believe it or not, Steelheart is the first I've heard of him. I've read that other view this book as \\"not one of his best,\\" but if that's the case, I definitely need to read the rest of his works, because I immensely enjoyed this novel.<br /><br />Calamity has gifted normal humans and seemingly only the evil or cruel ones, with amazing powers. These \\"Epics\\" hold the powers to fly, shot energy from their bodies, create illusions, and some are all but immortal. Our protagonist, David, lives only to avenge his murdered father (killed by the hands of Steelheart), and strives to join the Reckoners (the rebels killing Epics). Once with them though, everything isn't what it seems. He realizes even humanity's last hope isn't as heroic as he expected.<br /><br />Loyalties are questions, trust is fought for and lives are lost. Steelheart is chock full of humor, suspense, and of course, action. Sanderson hit a home run with this latest novel, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves a great read. You will not be disappointed, I promise you that.

1612680011|4.0|This is an excellent financial self-help book in many ways. It also contains some naïve advice. Kiyosaki (the narrator) and Lechter (the writer) present a highly motivational story. The model for personal financial improvement that they present appears to be sound, yet may open areas of risk that not all readers are equipped to take. One would be wise to weigh their advice in light of your own situation before adopting it wholeheartedly.<br /><br />The good and useful aspect of this book is its basic premise and presentation. The premise is that financial intelligence leads to wealth. The subtext is that most people lack that skill due to our society's widely-repeated belief that money is the root of all evil. Kiyosaki's rich dad said that saying is dead wrong. In presenting his thesis, the author explains the why and how of making money work for you rather than you working for money. \\"Escaping the rat race\\" he calls it. Along the way he offers a great deal of useful advice, education, examples and attitude-improvement tips to help you along. Some of the basic concepts are:<br /><br />- Be a generalist, not a specialist. Specialization is a lifetime ticket to the rat race.<br />- Learn to manage people through leadership skills. You want to hire top professionals, not become one.<br />- Learn to sell and market yourself and your products or services. Sales is key to whatever you do.<br />- Buy or create income-producing assets, not toys. Rental properties and book royalties make you money. Cars, boats, and gadgets take it away.<br />- Hold your assets in a corporation. Then your expenses are legitimately tax-deductible.<br />- Stay on the right side of the law. You don't have to cheat to succeed.<br /><br />The naïve advice aspect is his broad instruction to read a lot of books, take financial seminars, discover wealth-building \\"formulas,\\" play the real estate market and invest short-term in rising stocks. This trial-and-error method of building wealth may be how he built his fortune, but it falls short of truly useful advice for people trying to build their financial intelligence. The misleading aspect is the failure to mention that two of his companies went bankrupt (according to his Wikipedia biography), whereas his biography in the book paints a picture of uninterrupted successes. \\"Failure inspires winners,\\" says Kiyosaki. If so, why not share your experiences in the book? He does talk about these episodes frankly in a later book, pointing out that while the companies went bankrupt, he personally did not. This is a good example of financial intelligence: protect yourself and your personal assets from excess risk via the corporate structure. Many entrepreneurs are sole proprietors who are thus exposed to personal liability from their business dealings.<br /><br />The author says it's not easy to put his concepts into practice without setbacks, but neither is it hard to obtain the financial intelligence to accumulate wealth. \\"Simple math and common sense is all you need,\\" he says, plus the accounting concepts he presents in clear language and simple diagrams similar to those his \\"rich dad\\" used to teach him about making money when he was only nine years old. Kiyosaki says accounting (the basics) may be the most important discipline to learn if you want to get rich and stay that way.<br /><br />The book is peppered with wisdom borne of numerous negotiations and deals both successful and otherwise. For example, he says \\"For there to be a profit there must be two elements: a bargain and a change.\\" Getting both requires great patience and self-discipline. This wisdom applies not only to real estate, his primary example, but to stock market trading and most other forms of investment.<br /><br />Whatever your level of financial aptitude, this book is worth reading. If you are just getting interested in the subject of making more money and gaining financial independence, this is definitely for you as you will learn timeless basics. Should you be already well informed in the area of personal and investment finance, this book will refresh your thinking. I rate this book four stars.<br /><br />Note: my copy of this book was purchased used at Grassroots Books in Reno, Nevada.s.

B00CM4VC7M|4.0|So far it's my first figma/figuarts and I'm just in love with the quality. The time and effort that was put into this truly astounded me. It's literally like looking at a 3D version of Sailor Moon from the anime. There is however some complaints I have. For starters, she was a lot smaller than I was expecting. I mean really, she is tiny. She is literally the size of the palm of my hand. In fact, I can even hold her with just the palm of my hand. So, I was a bit disappointed in that. Also, her arms aren't exactly secure. They will fall off almost immediately even if I apply little to no pressure at all. That's why making her do poses or other things can be a bit time consuming when you have to worry about her limbs falling off every second. Another thing I noticed that there were tiny splotches of paint on her where there were not supposed to be. Now, I would just be fine by this if this was a bootleg, but it's not. It's an official item. In my opinion, it is completely unacceptable. But since it is Sailor Moon and we were granted this gorgeous figure, I will still however give it four stars. She looks beautiful on my shelf and yeah, overall, I'm glad I bought her. I don't know if I will buy the other Senshi though if it's closer to the quality as this. Oh well, regardless of that fact, this figure still is rather lovely to look at from a distance.
0385351399|5.0|There are parallels to a modern \\"1984\\" but what struck me, living in \\"The Valley\\" is not only how accurate it is around describing the cult corporate-villages aka \\"campuses\\" of Google, Apple, and Facebook--it's how dead-on it is describing how close to being accurate it is to interacting with the executives and engineers who work in them. No doubt there will be howls about this book in these digital ghettos about this book, and how they are really to quote an executive from Google \\"technologies of freedom.\\" We'll, not hardly.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good read, couldn't put it down. Good story line and good writing. I would recommend to anyone who likes a mystery, love story and drama in one
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|Sure, you can hear the difference between the pre-set styles and you can select your own equalizing, but if you're like me you're mostly using the built in speakers on your Kindle Fire to listen to things so what's the point? Also, whether using an auto pre-set or customizing your own, if you have any variety in your music playlists you're going to have to constantly re-adjust for each music style. Again, what's the point?
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Great show!<br />And it's not a greatest hit compilation, but a show with new titles and some classics remixed.<br /><br />Madonna is still the Queen of Pop, even if I do like the other girls pretending to take her throne.<br /><br />Would have loved a 3D blu-ray tough and more extras...
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had  difficult time reading this book. Actually put book aside read and finished another book. Came back to this book to give it another go at it. I did finish it but was disappointed; the characters well I could not feel them or their personality. Maybe it's me for expecting too much from Rowling.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|These poems are just terrific. I am always  in awe at authors who write poetry. Almost a lost art, these days,<br />so I am so glad to see this book.<br />So few words but filled with such meaning and great imagery. That's what the author has created here.<br />I loved all of them, but particularly the last line about the fixed heart in the Cauldron poem.<br />I also loved the Devil's Wish, what a mixture of wicked ingredients, very clever indeed. I could see kids enjoying these.<br />They fit so beautifully with the story of Peter a great companion book to enjoy as you<br />read Peter a Darkened Tale.<br />Beautifully crafted a must read if you enjoyed the novel as I did.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Absolutely riveting game. I was so hooked that I didn't put it down for hours. The only problem was, after not putting it down for hours I had finished all the puzzles. There was no point with doing them again as nothing changes.

The young ones of today should see this movie. They might learn something instead of wasting their time on drinking and drugs . Go to college for an education because  life is much too short as the movie tells you that.  Make your life count as this young couple did in deed.<br />Love and be loved.<br /><br />Barbara

0553565915|5.0|This was a beautiful book! I was blown away by it and extremely entertained at the same time. It's full of 'all encompassing' love that I just couldn't get enough of it. This author is truly a warm and compassionate human being. It's impeccably written and is also a quick read. This was one of those books that I couldn't put down until I was finished with it. Very riveting and lots of positive energy surrounds it. Highly recommend.

B002RKSZS0|5.0|Catherine Morland is excited to be going to an abbey. She has visions of its contents and its appearance, its history and its secrets. She, the heroine of Jane Austen's novel NORTHANGER ABBEY, has read too many novels.<br /><br />I was, as an Austen heroine herself might be, somewhat vexed at the outset of the book, at its superficial characters and its slowness. It seemed to be all about Bath, going to the Upper Rooms and then the Lower Rooms, and occasionally to Edgar's Buildings, the opera, and the theater. Not all that much was happening to stir the heart and soul of a 21st century reader. But as usual, and little by little, the author had me in her clutches. Catherine had met Henry Tilsen, a handsome, intelligent young man with more than his fair share of wit, in fact, so clever that to the rather benighted Catherine he seems downright strange. She is taken with him, and he with her, and we are swept away to Northanger Abbey itself, where she goes to visit and is intrigued, half-expecting a mystery of intrigue and perhaps murder.<br /><br />Jane Austen is so good at depicting chattery, busy women that she almost makes us like them. Certainly one of her best is in this novel--the shallow Isabella Thorpe, whom Catherine comes to love and misguidedly trust. The reader is soon onto Isabella, at the very least an annoyingly gushy type, at worst a manipulator and social climber who takes advantage of everybody in sight. Stupid, pompous men fare no better, for example Isabella's lying brother John. But, rising above them all to crown the story are Henry, a more attractive hero than even Mr. Darcy, and his wise and somewhat retiring sister Eleanor. There are more interesting portraits here, and by the end of the book we know them all far better than they know themselves.<br /><br />I particularly liked Austen's side commentary on the literary world of the day, which novelists she enjoyed, which she had somewhat dismissive words for through her characters. NORTHANGER ABBEY is a dense novel with simple, accessible themes. Through it all we almost know the ending, but not all, not quite. Even when the author tells us how everything will play out, we yearn to see for ourselves.BEY is a dense novel with simple, accessible themes.

Just a day or so later she said this book is so great and she is only 30 pages into it, but she cannot get enough time to read it because of her schoolwork. She is an avid reader so I expect that she will finish it on the weekend.

You know I've heard that this movie has more music than any other musical to date, yet you wouldn't think it was a musical while watching it.  After watching it a couple times, my wife gets it, and quotes some of the dialogue... &#34;my hair&#34;, &#34;I'm with you guys&#34;, &#34;isn't this a geographical oddity...&#34;<br /><br />This is a great guy AND chick movie.

B00B1TJO10|5.0|I found the kindle edition to be fantastic. I have an older hardback edition, and yes the weight is an issue! As I tend to read these books from front to back (I do believe it was written to be read this way in any case). Although this edition includes a lot of fluff that can be considered unnecessary. I am referring to the author starting every chapter with autobiographical info which can seem out of place a bit ... (and some of the examples can in the authors own words get a bit &#34;crass&#34;) I still give this book five stars as it is one of the best introductory stats books that aims to be comprehensive that I have read. I can recommend this book to anyone that has little or no background in stats that needs to come up to speed rather quickly, especially later starters. If you like to read on the train, then give the sample of the kindle edition a try.

The editing is good and the grammar is much better than that of many books I buy from Amazon.

0316322407|5.0|Malala is an inspiration for generations to come. She started her journey at a very young age and has already achieved what many people cant even dream of. As I read more and more about her, my appreciation for her increases further. Her best quality is her daring attitude in the face of extremist elements of Pakistani society. In a country where politicians, law enforcement agencies, police, media, religious leaders and government personnels have an apologetic stance about Taliban, Malala has been vocal about Taliban's atrocities since the age of 11. Even being shot in the head did not stop her from speaking and writing about Taliban's injustices. She has turned her revenge into the force of education which she wants each child to be equipped with.<br /><br />This book reminded me of a recently published book [[ASIN:098939770X The Wrong Kind of Muslim: An Untold Story of Persecution & Perseverance]]. In his book Qasim Rashid explains why Malala is born in a society  that has become apologetic to Taliban, opts illiteracy over education and uses guns instead of pens. Both books are untold stories persecution and perseverance.<br /><br />I wish Malala a long and healthy life and may her missions accomplish.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|What can I say? You either like Stephen King or you do not. I found the book to be an enjoyable read. One of the things I always enjoy about Stephen King is his sometimes bizarre sense of humor. I also enjoy his frequent interjections of portions of his personal life, which can always be found in his novels if you pay attention. I don't like all of his books and find his novellas quite disappointing at times but this book is a good read for anyone. I give it a four star rating. Whether or not this book can be considered a sequel to The Shining is up to the reader. If you are expecting Doctor Sleep to have all the elements of The Shining you are going to be disappointed. If, however, you treat the book as a stand alone story I'm certain you will enjoy it; not one of his best but certainly not one of his worst. In any event, I have always had a great amount of respect and admiration for Stephen King because he's a good writer and he lives life on his own terms.

B005MJFA2W|5.0|When I did my MBA in the early 1970s one of the constant mantras from the Organisation Behaviour lecturers was that the carrot was more important that the stick.  If you wanted to improve the performance of your team it was more important to praise good behaviour than criticise poor execution.  However then I entered the real world and became a sales manager.  I discovered that if I put a rocket up a poorly performing salesperson, he or she would get an order very quickly.  However if I openly praised recently successful sales person his or her performance would slide till the rocket finally came.  Finally I now know why.<br /><br />The epiphany occurred while I was recently reading Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman, recent recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.  Kahneman explains the reason why the stick works and the carrot fails is regression to the mean.  Having worked in financial services I know the worst thing an investor can do is choose this year’s top performing investment manager.  However I had never thought of doing the same with people, but reading Kalneman has made it obvious.<br /><br />Thinking, Fast and Slow describes how we all have two systems that drive the way we think and make choices. System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.  These of course are stages I and II of Emotional Intelligence.  Stage I is recognising our core emotional drivers, and Stage II is developing self control over our emotions by using moderation and logic.  Kahneman's thesis is that the human animal is systematically illogical. Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.  Emotions drive most of our decision making.<br /><br />The first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow and applying human logic might cause a different reaction.  However fast thinking is hardwired and is used more often.  Also thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain.  Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.  We don't invoke our System Two machinery unless it is needed.<br /><br />As an example of System Two in action Kanheman proposes the use of “Premortems” which was a suggestion by a colleague, Gary Klein.  This is not a word I had heard before but the idea is that manager projects himself forward 12 months and imagines that the project or investment is a complete disaster.  You then spend 10 minutes writing a history of that disaster, working backward to determine what potentially could lead to the failure.

So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow and applying human logic might cause a different reaction.  However fast thinking is hardwired and is used more often.  Also thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain.  Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.  We don't invoke our System Two machinery unless it is needed.<br /><br />As an example of System Two in action Kanheman proposes the use of “Premortems” which was a suggestion by a colleague, Gary Klein.  This is not a word I had heard before but the idea is that manager projects himself forward 12 months and imagines that the project or investment is a complete disaster.  You then spend 10 minutes writing a history of that disaster, working backward to determine what potentially could lead to the failure.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very happy with this app!!! I love horses so this app is perfect for me. I love to play it all day long
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|I'm a iphone case fanatic (I have a ton of 'em) and this case is in my Top 3.  It's a little slippery so be careful of that but it protects my phone well and it looks fantastic, love it!
B008JD7VZM|5.0|good but size is too small so my kids kind of dissapointed with the physical size of the item bought
B009K916ZK|4.0|This is the one you buy when you can't risk a Chinese reverse-engineered version failing. Recommended for a situation where failure of this adapter results in instant loss of revenue!
B008OOYALE|5.0|Play for hours on end so fun it's more then just a game it like a hobby in way it's like taken care of animals but only dragons
B007PVHMCG|5.0|good but size is too small so my kids kind of dissapointed with the physical size of the item bought
B00F91H666|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie and action (some scenes intense).  It is not for kids.  I would consider watching it again, which is rare for me.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Enjoyed this fantasy tale was good. A different twist than original tale  and lots of exciting and scary moments in this tale.
1931559317|4.0|This is a really handy book which delivers on the promise of a complete and easily navigable collection of star charts for the amateur astronomer looking for observing targets.  Charts are easy to find once you understand how they are laid out.  However, like most star charts they will be &#34;reversed&#34;, or a mirror-image of what you see in the sky.  Why?  Because they are from the perspective of a person on the &#34;outside&#34; of our celestial sphere looking &#34;in&#34; towards Earth.  Apparently that's how most (if not all) star charts are designed.  I'm not a big fan of this, but you take what you can get.  I was able to find nearly everything I wanted simply by turning the book upside-down when I was at the chart I needed to look at.  For the price, you won't find much else with the quality, accuracy and completeness this book gives you.  I'd give it five stars, if only the star charts actually looked just like what you saw in the night sky (no flipping).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books I've read them all about four times they are a wonderful read.<br />Would recommend these books to read to all my friends....
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Hubby enjoyed this  more than me  it was good.<br />Guys always enjoy  the thriller actions spys etc.  He said it was a good movie.
B005SZEFH6|5.0|Great book not just in terms of fighting fundamentals but Bruce Lee the philosopher is brilliant.  A bit hard to understand the first time around, some paragraphs/pages might need to be read again to fully grasp what Bruce Lee is saying.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  Much much more then a book about fighting.  A great read for anyone
B00594XOZU|1.0|I had this app before and it worked fine then. Now I'm trying to log in and it keeps giving me an error because it's taking too long. This seems to be a re occurring problem  because I'm seeing a lot of reviews just like this. Please fix it!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This one had very little language that was offensive and used in a critial life saving moment. From the  first  5 minutes of peace the whole world was upside down  infested with zombie virus... a thriller Pit was  excellent for part  I recommend this one to anyone.<br />Children I feel would have nightmares.
B002RI97IY|5.0|This is a book written by a true seer, one who gives us the source of true consciousness the book written by consciousness itself!<br />For me , this book was a life changing  experience . This is not just a book, it is the Bible , the Upanishads , the philosophy of the creation and the creator all rolled in to one!
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|it is pretty much the same as the free version, but overall it has great graphics... I recommend that you try the free version first.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This film has the same guarantee of Star Trek performance as all the films do another winner we will get this for our extended library.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|First off I have to say that having Head back makes a huge difference in their sound. I seriously feel like there was a huge void in all their albums after he departed. Part of their edge was missing and you could tell dramatically.<br /><br />So when I heard when it was first announced that Head was touring with Korn again I was stoked. And then it was announced that there was going to be a new album and he was writing music with them, I was even more stoked. And here we are.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to give the song breakdown like everybody else. It's a little pointless because just about everybody has the same viewpoints and opinions. What I will say is that the void after all these years has been filled. Somebody mentioned in a review that this is their best since Untouchables and I have to agree. However, this is a much..much more aggressive album and that is certainly not a bad thing.<br /><br />I'm not going to say this is a return to form, even though it kind of is, but having Head back means a world of difference. Hearing him play with Munky again is a great thing. I'm going to be blasting this when I'm driving until I'm sick of it. It's going to be hard for me to want to listen to anything else for awhile.<br /><br />I'm not going to say it's my favorite Korn album just yet but it's one of their best for sure.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Nice to rent  and stay at home loved the twist of this one..So different but very well done enjoyed it at home.
B00AWJMTXK|5.0|Have heard for years of P.G. Wodehouse, but never took the time to sample his work.  This is a great read.  His sense of humor is crisp 100 years later.  The banter between characters is very clever.  Worth the time to give it a chance.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|When I am on my break people stare at me, especially when I break out laughing. The game is ingenious, simple, challenging, and more importantly FUN.<br /><br />Race through a side scrolling puzzle attempting to get all 3 green apples before the local kid gets em first. Jump over obstacles, slide down ropes, drop bananas to slow the kid, and throw baseballs to knock out windows.<br /><br />I can't tell you the amount of pleasure I have gained from this game, but I imagine you'll find out soon!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|My family loved the movie and the emotion which the songs were sung with.  The kids love singing along and remembering the story as they hear it.  It has been playing nearly non-stop since we got it. If you loved the movie, you'll love this soundtrack.
0743277708|5.0|I read this in high school. Now, I am reading it again. It was important then and is now. That's what a classic does: it challenges you without the limits of time or situation. The story is an example for humans...to strive and get on with life despite differences and/or circumstance. I ordered it from amazon to have a copy and I have ordered it from the local public library to let them know how vital I think it is as something worth my time.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I thought this movie was an \\"on the edge of your seat\\" thriller. It was surprisingly intense and kept me watching the whole time. Right off the bat it opens with action and remains action packed throwout. I was the theatrical version and the uncut version, they are close to the same. I bought this one after watching it in the theater. Good movie.
B005TBN3EU|4.0|these guys are such idiots its funny. like the laughs. this is a good comedy movie. I rented it twice this year.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|I love it because the fighting peaceful.There were good graphics&quot;It was very very very very awesome&quot;I like the sound of the game.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Robert downey jr makes the movie he is such a good actor. very good movie. love the little surprise from pepper also.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I love Google BUT this is not what I would expect from them!!!<br /><br />I plugged it in to my smart TV thinking that there was a possibility that it would perform better than the TV.  No such luck.  It will not work with older Android OS's (2.3 is what I tried first).  It worked with my Chrome browser but it was slow and clunky.  I have a cable internet connection that is usually running at about 30 Mbps.  When I use my laptop or tablet to stream Netflix to it, it makes multitasking online almost impossible.<br /><br />I cannot find any technical details about how this device receives the signal/data that it send through the HDMI output, but it seems like the data is actually steaming through the device that you are using as the remote, then back through your router to the Chromecast.  Using this causes my Cisco wireless router to have trouble keeping a good internet connection to other active devices on my wireless network.<br /><br />It seems that Google should have the remote be setup so that (with the exception of Chrome browser tabs) data be streamed directly to the Chromecast from the internet service (like Netflix or You Tube) instead of through the remote like it seems to do.
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I love this weather app. It lets you look at weather all over the country. It also shows you what the weather is all week.
B000VSAEYI|3.0|Kind of cheap but kids loved it, worked for what we needed but loses air fast. Just realize will likely only last one season if that!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Best game ever I play it daily love the graphics an THE free play n all the options for my friends to join
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The story of Dan Torrence is an interesting follow up to the Shining. Well worth the time for any fans of the first novel
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have found this app wonderful for use in my classroom during quiet work time. It helps keep them calm and focused. Thanks.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|Would recommend this movie to my Mom.  Liked story. Loved Maggie Smith. Glad it has ghosts. Love the location. End
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|It is a very cool app. It gives me very accurate forecast wherever I live. I can even update it anytime I want.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played minecraft for along time and I think it is the best game in the world! I bought it along time ago but I have so much fun and now I'm a pro at it and I create really cool stuff on creative and survival.And my friends love it too so much so you should get it.
B00DU74U74|4.0|This was an interesting twist on Sci-fi/romance.  It was a clean movie, not a lot of action, but an interesting watch, especially if you like dystopian type novels and movies.
0984183523|5.0|I bought this book for my wife.<br /><br />She experienced a lot of inspiration on how to make a structured speech, mind sets of interview, etc. using the book and its package.
159463176X|5.0|I love anything by this man.  I love reading stories that cross the generations, connecting a certain few main characters as they go through their interesting lives.  His descriptions are great, and I just get lost in his stories and can hardly put the book down.
0689835604|5.0|This is one of my 9-month-old daughter's favorite books. We have a number of the Karen Katz lift-the-flap books, but this one still seems to engage her the most. The flaps in this book in particular are easy for her to find and lift, and I think she enjoys looking at all the baby faces on each page.<br /><br />The book itself is sturdy, but be aware when leaving them alone with it - our daughter tore one of the flaps out and likes to try to eat the flaps as well. That said, she's been playing around with this book for over a month now, and so far we've only lost one flap, so not too bad!
B000JIHP88|5.0|Nice colors, bright but not gaudy. Bought it as a gift for my new grandson.  Would buy as a gift for anyone with a baby.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This useful little gadget was a snap to set up and gives new functionality to my Macbook Pro, my iPad and my iPhone. You install it on a free HDMI port on your TV, download the app to your computer, and Bob's your uncle. Now anything I see within Chrome I can see on my TV. And of course, being a Google product, all YouTube videos are visible on my TV as well. I fired up YouTube on my iPhone and there were the videos on my big screen. Have videos in your hard drive? Use &#34;Open File&#34; on Chrome, run the videos within the browser, and they're on your big screen as well. The sound comes through loud and clear. All this for $35. Thank you, Google!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I have been playing this game and love it but today October 9 say I can't get back on until I get an update but I can't find one now I can't play sucks please make an update so I can still play cause I really like playing<br />And won't connect to facebook
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Her character development is spot on and I end up IN LOVE with the characters by the end of the book, not wanting to finish the story....good thing there were 2 more in this series ;) I loved the use of poetry slams in the book and thought it was such a cool and different way to make people feel while reading the story. Also, did I mention that I LOVE the characters. Layken and Will are now one of my favorite ALL TIME literary couples, but so are Sky/Hope and Holder/Dean (READ THE HOPELESS SERIES IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY). Thanks Colleen for your writing, I can't wait to read more!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought one of these for my son as well as myself.  I'm very happy with the product and actually planning on purchasing a third one now for another family member.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Easy to install and perfect for American &#34;Mountain&#34; Bikes. I was leary of other European bike seats because they didn't look to fit the standard American bike. This is secure, but also easy to slide off if I want to ride my bike without the seat. My child loves it and although my legs do have to ride a little wider to fit the seat/baby- it's not enough to make me super uncomfortable. If I was to ride a LONG distance, I think it would grow old, but I've only done 3-5 mile trips.
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|why must &#34;one touch ordering&#34; be enabled to open or play free apps?<br />this is extortion.  i don't want my grandchildren to buy things unless i approve it first.
0679805273|5.0|A must have book for every child! I purchase one for each child and have their teachers sign it at the end of the school year- when they graduate high school, it will be their present!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|This cd is AMAZING.... If you are a TTB fan, it is a requirement for your collection. If you are a fan of music you will love it too! They really knocked this one out of the park. I cannot stop tapping my toes!
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|This season diverges off the books, so I was disappointed about that. It still has great acting, costume, scenery and production. Still worth watching, especially if you are invested in the show!
B004GXHOGK|5.0|All Schleich animals are the best! My grandchildren love them and play imaginatively for hours and hours! Always a happy choice!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This season follows the book SO well, and I love that! Great costume, acting, scenery, production- truly a great show!

B00865P3AS|2.0|I found the whole production somewhat of a bore ...  There was very little back and forth between the 2 cellos, and  backup accompanyment  showed a complete lack of creativity..
B000K4WLXA|5.0|Loved the whole movie, loved the books, loved the script. I think this is one of the best collector's items I've ever had.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|Just say no and you will be happy.  You are playing pong, not being chased by someone.  Company does not need to know what they are wanting to collect from you.  No need for adware on a paid app.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|When I was deciding whether or not to purchase this book, I read some of the reviews and was really uncertain. Well I'm glad I did. I was not disappointed ! I found it to be a well-written 'memoire' of a difficult time in a young woman's life. I'm so glad her family and Larry stood by her.<br />Very interesting read and the only disappointment for me was reaching the end of the book (although I was happy that Piper was finally released !!!)<br />I hope Piper and Larry live a long and happy life together !
B00BMR4RIG|2.0|You dont have to look at the ads if you don't want. I have tried to make stuff pop but it appears as if there isn't anything here but last page ads.  It does need a few permissions but they are legit. Internet and GPS.  Ap is ok. Nothing special. I have a free one on my thunderbolt that does the same thing.  Graphics are a little under ok.  Underwhelming is what it aamounts to. That being said it does exactly what it says it will do.  Oh, I tool a star away for the ads in a paid app.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. Very entertaining. A quick easy distraction. Very easy to use and understand. Like the statistics page. Recommend to anyone.

B00846REIS|5.0|OMG!! AWESOME BOOK AND SERIES!!!!I loved this story. For the Fifty and Beautiful Disaster lovers out there, you will love this book because it has a very similar feel and flow to it. ENOUGH SAID!!!
B00E9E4EC8|2.0|I'm sorry,  I really did want to like it.  I love Alan Jackson and I love Bluegrass, but the songs he chose are not the best and it just is not up to expectations.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|doesn't have a lot to it but its a good way to waste an hour I guess. there are definitely bigger wastes of time out there.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I'm going to make this shortish and sweet. I have read both books about 6 times each and listened to the audio books at least as many times. You may ask \\"why read or listen to the same book over and over again?\\" Simple. I love it! This is easily my favorite series of books and I can't say enough about them! This story will draw you in cuddle you up and keep you entertained through every last word. Read it. Listen to it. Tell a friend! Also, the narrator for the audio books is amazing. I have never heard a better narrator and I promise you, I have listened to many. Take a dive into this story and I assure you, you will come out feeling happier than you went in!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Great story of living out faith in the face of evil.  It's very violent and thus not for the kiddos. However, Denzel is amazing.  Loved it!
1577314808|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I am finding it very interesting and readable.  Actually it is relaxing to read . I mislaid the book and had a hard time finding it,  but now, I am eager to get back to it.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Ironman 3 DVD, What a movie and all the hidden stories in it. Then when it was over.. it was over.. So Glad I added this to my collection.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love it.  It is the only way I listen to music these days. I use it on a couple of different devices many times a day and have never had an issue with it force closing or skipping.  Overall a great app!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game , my only complaint is having to wait for energy to recharge! I would definitely recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I had this app on my HTC Evo and while it was quite useful I disliked that it didn't have the dictionary function as the actual kindle device did.  I have since downloaded this app on my HTC One and the upgrades are great.  I love the built in dictionary and internet search functions.  I also love love love that is marks my spot in my book across all of my devices and syncs accordingly.  The reason for the four stars instead of five is that this app just stops working and shuts down periodically.  It's not something that makes the app worthless but it is frustrating sometimes.  I'm hoping for an update to fix that problem soon but until then I'll soldier on with restarting because I really do love this app.
1572816295|5.0|My deck arrived yesterday, and it's beautiful!, like most decks, has the perfect size, but the illustrations are beyond words, they're so dreamy, magical, i'm totally happy with this product!

1897299214|4.0|In 2001, French-Canadian cartoonist Guy Delisle traveled to North Korea for two months on a work visa to supervise the animation of a children's cartoon show, which was commissioned by a French animation studio. As he supervised a team of North Korean animators, Delisle experienced the terrible hotel, constant \\"companionship\\" of his handlers and a barrage of over-the-top propaganda typical of North Korea. Later, Delisle turned his experience into a graphic travelogue.<br /><br />The content of the book is not particularly special. Although North Korea is very isolated, a small cohort of international tourists have visited Pyongyang and wrote about their experience. Delisle's account does not deviate much from their stories: they all experienced constant surveillance from their handlers, subpar accommodations and a steady stream of propaganda. More importantly, like most of the international visitors, Delisle did not get to travel freely into the more despair-inducing parts of North Korea.<br /><br />Where Delisle's book shines, however, is the presentation. Because filming freely in North Korea is virtually impossible, Delisle's graphic travelogue provides an important means through which the reader can visualize Pyongyang. Delisle's drawings are attractive in their combination of minimalism and sharp eyes for details. In Delisle's skillful presentation, the reader can picture herself in Pyongyang in a way that she likely cannot do with written words.<br /><br />In fact, even if filming was freely allowed in North Korea, Delisle's travel accounts would have added something new. His clever and witty manner of story telling, embedded in the keen but delicate representation of what he saw in Pyongyang, conveys real emotions at every turn: unease and creepiness, yet surprising humanity and empathy. No amount of film making, for example, would have properly conveyed the depressingly fake smiles of the little girls playing accordions en masse. Even when we hear the same joke, we laugh harder when the delivery is good.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  Read this book if you are not familiar with the standard North Korean travelogue, as Pyongyang may represent the best of them.<br /><br />T.K.<br />Reading Korea (readingkorea.blogspot.com)oke, we laugh harder when the delivery is good.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  Read this book if you are not familiar with the standard North Korean travelogue, as Pyongyang may represent the best of them.<br /><br />T.K.<br />Reading Korea (readingkorea.blogspot.com)

B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|For those of you who enjoyed the game FTL this game is a must have. Plays really well, looks great, and has an awesome soundtrack.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Wonderful DVD for a wonderful season! Something all Supernatural fans should have and have along with the first seasons 1-7
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Well- the games that work are really fun. Remember if you're on a Kindle Fire to go to settings and disable the Airplane level. The moose level also simply won't work beyond the first round- the Kindle only registers 2 points of contact for the game- so you can only plug two holes. Just relax and hope it only happens a few times.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was my first read by Liane Moriarty.  I couldn't put it down....one of those books you can't stop reading but don't want to end.  Well written and thought provoking.  Can't wait to read What Alice Forgot next.
0312427646|5.0|I loved this book! I don't like using exclamation points, but this novella was great. For those who enjoy reading this book is a treat. The story begins when Queen Elizabeth accidentally enters a mobile library. Out of politeness, she checks out a book. Prior to this, she had never really read for pleasure.<br />The first book she reads is boring, but one book leads to another and it soon becomes an all consuming passion. Her new habit causes much consternation in the royal household from Prince Philip to the lowly pages. The book touches upon many of the same emotions and ideas that passionate readers have in a functionally illiterate world.<br />The ending is brilliant.
B000002LLC|5.0|I have always listened to this album so I couldn't be more biased.  L O V E it. I wish they would have added the &#34;back in business&#34; that was in the movie, but other then that I love each song... some more than others :P  Lets not look past Vogue either. If you A. like Dick Tracy B. Like Madonna or C. Both... this is a great choice.

B00BCZU8WM|2.0|Its not what I thought it would be.  I only like Suit and Tie and Mirrors.  Don't care for the other songs.  Way too long and too much wrap.  That's fine that he does that, I just won't buy any more of his music.  I do still like Justin though.
0670024856|5.0|This elegant novel follows the Whittaker family through the lives of a father and daughter committed to the study of botany through the 18th and 19th centuries. Ms. Gilbert, of Eat, Pray, Love fame, has returned to the foray of fiction after 13 years, and her lyrical and graceful writing delights the reader. Low-born Henry Whittaker decides to take fortune in his own hands as he smuggles his way to riches through rare botanical finds. His daughter Alma is also fascinated by the world of plants, but her life is torn between the scientific and the spiritual, much like many in the mid 19th century. A rare novel that should be dull and plodding in its perusal of a subject such as botany, but instead it lifts up the reader with engaging narratives and singular character development.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Anything Blake does is great!!!  I love this CD and all his others!  I truly hope that he keeps coming out with great songs!  I love him on the Voice too!  You can tell he is a good guy.  His music is fun and romantic.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS. This book brought tears to my eyes multiple times. So eye opening and I learned helpful and important life lessons just from reading this book. It make  me so tender to hear Auggie's story and to be able to read a first hand perspective of what this kind of life would be like. Even hearing from Via's boyfriend was so inspirational and lovely to read. This book is a definite 5 star. No doubt about it. Thank you<br />.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This album is wonderful!  Emeli has such a unique voice.  Usually when you get a CD you usually only like the hit from it.  I love all the songs!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very great! It makes your mined go when you need to figure out passwords and patterns. Good game
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Probably one of the more fun games I've played in a long time.  Would recommend trying it out. I have enjoyed this game and find it to be a great challenging way to spend some free time.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cable and fast charger worked absolutely wonderful.  Unlike my old one, the connections were tight.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Great!!!
B000VE439Y|5.0|Monty Python is at the height of all that is humorous. This movie is obviously no exception. It is worth watching millions of times. Yes, I did say millions.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|This album combines every elements of the first 10 albums and blend them perfectly to create a powerful and epic masterpiece of the 21st century!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Excellent music. Excellent interviews. Interesting perspectives are revealed. A must for musicians who like to get inside other musicians' heads.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|I love this movie!  The anniversary edition has great special features, including interviews with the cast, and the disc was in top condtrion.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent commodity<br />Thank you
B006LSZECO|3.0|There were twists- however, in my opinion, this story is heavily based upon Scott and Laci Peterson.<br />The Author,in my opinion knows this.<br />Twists, certainly, good writing. Great imagination.
B004PJG7MW|5.0|It was a fantastic movie kids loved it =) I would recommend this movie for a good family night =)
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Fun book. Loved the presentations of the autistic man. A happy read, not too thought provoking, a few home truths.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you are a Verizon FIOS customer and you are NOT a techy person - DONT BUY THIS!!. Make sure you try seting up this device on a laptop, phone or desktop. If one doesnt work and connection is not establised - try another one. I had to try 3 different laptops. 3rd one was a charm after I changed the configuration on the router.<br />If you have a Verizon Actiontech router you need to enable UNPN and disable IGMP. When you call Verizon - they will not help you. Menus to these items are disabled on the router. Even verizon tech will not now where they are. After a long search here is a workaround. You have to enable UNPS it with this link http://192.168.1.1/index.cgi?active_page=900 and you have to disable IGMP with this link http://192.168.1.1/index.cgi?active_page=6059. If that doesnt work then you are on your own. It tooke me a good 2 hrs or reasearch, 1hr wasted with stupid verizon tech that didnt help me a bit. Calling actiontech will not help you either.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|You should see it, maggie smith is great. It really is a wonderful movie. It makes you look at life much better
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|This movie was so much fun! I am not a fan of horror movies but this was an interesting story about the making of one of our most famous ground-breaking horror movies ever. Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren were wonderful together as Alfred and Alma. I am not sure how much of the story is true and how much is artistic license; however, the movie kept me entertained, and really, that is hard to come by with movies these days.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I don't know why but this series of books has grown on me. I started out thinking it was kind of a let down. However every time I reread it, at 4 and counting, I like it more. It fills me up just a bit more every time.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is like old-school Black Sabbath with a cleaner sound. Really enjoy this album. God is Dead? Age of Reason, End of the Beginning and Live Forever are favorites but the whole album is really well done. Just saw them in concert and they still ROCK!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have played the game twice now and it locks up at the same point every time. I am playing on a kindle fire. And every time I get to the second puzzle called frog toss, it locks up the game on the third piece. If won't let me have what appears to be a hat. My only choice at this point is to put the game back on the cloud and start all over. This is very frustrating because I have put in several weeks of play and even purchased the game before I discovered this problem with the game. I really like this game and hope you will fix this bug in the game soon.<br /><br />Jnveth@gmail.com
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The ultimate game to bring to the table gamers who like online strategy games. SO much fun and easy to adapt.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great app, easy to use and very fun! I think that this app is so far the best of the Angry Birds series! ;)
0345803485|5.0|Excellent story well told. Can't wait to see Charlie Hunnam as Christian Grey. I read the book with his image and it works very well.
B00FPH6PRK|3.0|A bit slow moving and not overly scary. I loved the characters and they did an EXCELLENT job of drawing you into the movie. Great acting and a well told story. Besides that though, it was a slightly above average \\"haunting\\" flick that attempted to deliver an R rated \\"boom\\" but fell short in doing so. Could have easily been a \\"PG-13\\" rating IMO.
B009K2SLYG|5.0|Great and classic comedy film. A must see for any who love comedy. One of the best of all time.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Awesome movie. Also it completed my Harry Potter collection! I was worried at first because the price was good and when i recieved the movie the case was flimsy and I wasn't sure that the movie would be an original, but it was! :) so yes it's good folks!
B006RXPYXM|4.0|This was a good movie. Great acting all around. Very well made and paced well. A  good movie night film.
B006BFK5DK|4.0|Purchased the new EWF listen to it over n over it grows on you it really good they always release excellent music to enjoy although would have liked more ballads to add to devotion, i write a song,reasons n imagination so go get it today.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Never read the book, so let me put that disclaimer out there first.  I saw the previews for this, and thought to myself it could be  great new series of movies....  I was very wrong.  The only decent aspect of this entire movie, was Jeremy Irons... and even he seemed strained/struggling at times.  If it becomes free on Amazon Prime, perhaps you can steal a peek then.. otherwise, leave it alone and stick to the books.
098555780X|5.0|My students love looking at the variety of designs.  With a little guidance from me, they are able to easily follow the instructions because of the accompanying step-by-step pictures.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|In the movie, they say that the closer you look, the less you see. In fact, the movie is worth watching more than once, just to see what you missed the first time.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|meh. this movie was really not worth the time. I actually think i enjoyed the special features more then the actual film.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This 2 DVD set is well worth it.  The 1st DVD is a excelent concert at the Royal Albert Hall in England.  I have been there in person and the acoutics are awsome.  The 2nd DVD is a well edited behind the scenes of the tour.  I enjoyed the 2nd DVD as much as the first DVD.  This is a well put together package.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played, and it was free. I also like that you can join bingo blitz elite for extra things and it dosen't get boring.....it is more than just regular bingo
1401938906|5.0|I've read so many self-help/manifesting books, I'm surprised I haven't attracted a paper mill to appear on my front lawn. But this is one of my favorites. Pam Grout writes with humor, wisdom and ingenuity to explain metaphysical principles and quantum physics. I love the experiments -- THEY ALL WORK.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Good movie Really liked it as it's a Star Trek Film.  Some adjustment to the new actors but it seems to work
B00BSN0K1C|3.0|The figure once you get it has very little resemblance to the figure advertised. It's like watching a burger commercial and when you get in the store, it's a hot mess.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Enjoy going back in time, through time, and in time with the lovely storytelling of Mrs. Threshold.  Like listening to my grandpa.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|No Question The Tenth Anniversary is best but still waiting for it on  BLU-RAY (WHEN) So in the mean time this one will have to do.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Some folks thought thus Bosch story was  slow or ponderous. They should stick to comic books. This story is well written and paced like a classic Mickey Spillane story. You could practically feel the low reverberant tones of a lonely sax.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The characters take me into a very emotional roller coaster ride. You think you know what happens next but you don't.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Awesome quality!!!  My kids absolutely love it.  Not easily found in the stores.  Was glad that I could find it and have it shipped so quickly
B00D660M6M|5.0|I found Tom Odell on YouTube with the song \\"Another Love\\" and was blown away.  Mr. Odell continued to blow my mind as I discovered more of his songs.  I knew this was musical love at first sight, and so I made sure to purchase his album when I got the chance to.<br /><br />How could a girl/woman not delight in a handsome young man belting sultry tunes on a piano?  You look at him and you think, \\"He is so young and look at those cute blonde locks,\\" but don't let that fool you.  This artist is full of hot and heavy emotions mature enough to last a person through a life time of romantic disappointments if need be.  One must question if he is possibly possessed by a song demon and groomed to make tunes this intense and knowing.  No, actually he worked very hard to get to where he is now and you can find out by doing some research on him.<br /><br />Of course, I am being funny, but the music really did affect me.  When I first heard \\"Another Love\\" the words and song illustrated my deepest thoughts at the time almost exactly.  Then the magic happened again when I heard the haunting song \\"Can't Pretend\\", I felt strangely uncomfortable.  The song had successfully evoked emotions in me I've struggled to forget from deep relationships-past.  If I'm not mistaken, this is how good music is supposed to be.  To me, this music is a sort of therapy in a trial-by-fire kind of way, like watching a really good drama.<br /><br />Personal experience aside, the album is perfect for a thoughtful evening with the lights dimmed and a glass of wine.
B00338QENI|3.0|There seems to be something lacking in this book I think it's probably compassion and feeling for the subject I know the author was personally involved with the family but there's something about the aloofness. I like historical type books and nonfiction but this would not be one of my favorites
B004UUKDNA|4.0|I heard this band with the song \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" on Rock Band last year.  I found this album scrolling down Amazon's list and the CD was really cheap with AutoRip so I bought the physical copy.  I like to buy the whole album and give the whole thing a listen to find hidden treasures that might be overlooked otherwise.  There are some reviewers that said the full CD is not worth it, but I think at 10 bucks, the extra tracks were worth it.<br /><br />The band seems to give some the impression of another mainstream band for the youthful masses.  I could see why because the songs are really upbeat and pure and innocent like the budding emotions of puppy-love.  The overall sound could be deemed digestible and pleasing to most ears.  This would probably lead some to say the band lacks the depth and complexity to be considered inventive or a great work of art.  Perhaps the band chose to make the lyrics repetitive and easy to remember instead of adding the depth for the sake of wider acceptance.  Even so, music doesn't always have to be scored on complexity alone.  And who knows, maybe next album, they will add a more profound shade to their style.<br /><br />All judgments aside, I found myself listening to this album a lot lately.  The sound is so fresh and goes perfectly with the bright rays of morning.  I like to put this album on when I'm alone in my room, and I feel like the coolest kid ever.  The sound is unobtrusive and friendly for most tasks.  The entire album is full of emotions of a shy romance.  My favorite song right now is \\"Miss You\\".  The vocalist croons softly full of sensitivity and sentiment; sometimes loving and sad, other times hopeful.  Given the way the entire album feels, I think the \\"Torches\\" mentioned are the kind someone still carries for the one they adore, and the songs are the words that he or she cannot voice.<br /><br />I really hope they continue to make music like this.  I encourage people to give this product a chance.  I'm really glad I did.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|A movie that enriches christmas experience . Very funny, my wife and kids love it. We love watching it over and over again
0061950726|4.0|This book is sweet and haunting and endearing! Such a good read!!!! I zoomed through it! The blend of the old and new between chapters is so cool!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I am very pleased with this app. I can choose different sounds at one time to have them overlap and create different experiences. I enjoy listening for a while before bed.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It was a wonderful conclussion to a long building story.  If you haven't read any wheel of time books start from the beginning.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised how much fun this game was and how long you could play with never spending a dime!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My game is fun time out for me and stretches my brain every day. I would have it to my app whenever asked.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chromecast works as described.  I'm very excited to have it.  I use it to watch Netflix.  It its an affordable alternative to other devices.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|Update 10-12-13--  product works great,  I received a defective connector on the unit but this was quickly resolved by anker customer service.  Now I have power!!!  Thanks anker!!<br /><br />Old review below---<br /><br />I want to like this charger because I need one.  It is very sleek and like the way that the charging cord tucks into the unit.  Unfortunately when I try to charge my 4S with the included accessory, it charges for about 1 minute then stops charging.  Not sure what happens at this point internally in the Anker, but the lights do not light up or it doesnt charge no matter what I do.  The only way to correct this issue is to plug the Anker into the wall to charge it, this somehow resets the unit and the lights come on again, but this same action will happen again if I attempt to charge my iPhone.<br /><br />Perhaps it is simpler to carry the charger wherever I go and count on it more......
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Really enjoyed the book and the characters were well developed. It was a little predictable and ended as if there would be more books to follow, but still an enjoyable story.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Having an interesting and unpredictable story is always a plus. Fast paced and very good. Almost a perfect book I need more like this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was worth the 3 week wait! Took 5 minutes to install and I use it ALL THE TIME. Easy to use and works great with Netflix & Youtube on my iPad. Can't wait for them to roll out this technology on other platforms.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I had to reset my kindle and when I got kik back it didn't log in. It said to try again Im so mad
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Had no idea what to expect all the way through it but found myself in an analogy at the end.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I'm used really lengthy books, but this was unnecessarily long. It overly detailed certain things and didn't go into detail about things I wanted to read about. A good read overall though.
0307747883|5.0|I purchased it for my sister and she is thoroughly enjoying it.  Since she is blind and her only pleasure is hearing television and books on tapes or CD.  She listened to this one over and over again.
1401323820|5.0|Well as a Castle super fan, my opinion of these novels is a bit bias, that being said...Still an amazingly fun romp!  Great intro to the series, and I highly recommend people read it where it falls in their watching of the series. When Rick Castle writes the thing and Beckett attends the launch party...go a head and read chapter 1, you wont be sorry!
B00EQ30RVY|3.0|I liked \\"Out of Time\\" first listen, ,I wanted to hate it. I do not like the firing of Scott, I feel STP betrayed him.....i got lots to say about this....<br /><br />first lets talk about this EP<br /><br />Its always nice to hear The Deleo bros backing tracks, I just love they're playing and the drummer is always awesome.<br /><br />Chester does surprisingly well, he's not as good as scott even on scott's bad day. Two completely different singer, Scott is a better song writer and singer with better range.<br /><br />\\"Black Heart\\" love the music, Chester sounds whiny on this, Chester sings like he got neutered theres no manly balls,<br />The song is cool, if Scott sang this<br /><br />\\"Tomorrow\\"...HE KILLED THIS<br /><br />Tomorrow and Out of time are the stand outs in my opinion<br /><br />Same on the inside, Its pretty good too.<br /><br />Cry Cry Cry.....its there<br /><br />I'd actually like to hear a full CD from them with chester to fully make my decision, but for now i'm merely tolerating this masquerade
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Best movie ever! That's the only reason I bought it. I don't buy movies, but this one has been the only exception.
B001C3I4UM|4.0|While I've enjoyed this eclectic collection innumerable times throughout the years, I am pleasantly reminded of how enjoyable it can be to mix things up every time I come back to it.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|...was pretty much awful, sorry to say: Tiger Suit.  Ugh, she was almost unrecognizable there!<br /><br />Here she goes for a more spare, laid back, soulful and almost contemplative vibe rather than the raucous, hook-filled tunes of \\"Eye to the Telescope\\" (still her best album of course)...almost folksy, in parts...but on the whole, her enormous talent shines through in just about every track.  Just don't expect to blast this album at a party or anything, it's more for listening with a glass of wine or good whiskey in your hand, preferably on a really good set of headphones (NOT Bose or Beats or Monster, please!).
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Awesome read!!!<br />The science nerd in me loves the concept of this story maybe being very real while the dreamer in me loves the fictional possibilities of this story being real in some alternative universe that is right beside us without of being aware of it... except for that special someone like Nate that can see things that normal people cannot.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|This product works perfectly. Using this for two monitors connected to my security camera DVR with no noticeable loss of video quality. Very economical compared to other products that do the same thing.
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|If you like Time Travel stories then you need to read this series! Dip into the world where Nate tries to save the people closest to his heart without sacrificing thousands in the process. It's a roller coaster of a ride. Recommended!
1616550414|3.0|i bought 2, both came a little damaged on the cover, but the book is great and the art is amazing, totally recomended!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|One has to suspend belief and enjoy the fx.  It is,  when boiled down, a cowboy and Indians film except both the cowboys and Indian ally together against lizard looking aleins who travelled the universe with their advanced technology and space ship to mine for gold!!!!!!!!??????  . Men on horsebacks and Indians with spears destroy the aliens flying around in high speed fighter spaceships armed with lasers and missiles and torpedoes.!!!!!  I am not sure what is the message of this film : that cowboys and Indians can and should unite against aliens who come to the US to steal its gold and enslave a portion of its population for their wicked purposes????!!.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This was a great book that changed my family's eating habits forever. After being off wheat now for 4 months, I can attest to the physiological issues I feel even after consuming a small amount of wheat. It's not worth the discomfort - and I'm not celiac!<br /><br />We've found that a lot of the recipes are excellent and definitely worth trying. I've lost weight since eliminating wheat and I feel great.
034580404X|5.0|This is a great series. I borrowed it from a co worker and bought my own. I highly recommended purchasing it.. I loved the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Total fun and very easy to play. I would recommend this to my family and friends. The beach area is the best
B009LDD22U|5.0|Was very funny season love this show hope it stays on for a while just started getting into it ll
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|I love star trek. I am used to Next Generation and it's characters. But, as I watch each episode it really grew on me with Janeway as Captain. Great show and always good plots.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I was greatly anticipating this novel because I had heard Doctor Sleep was written much like King's early works and the main character, Dan Torrence, is all grown up.  I am not sure whether I am loving this novel however.  It reminds me of some of my dreams--they seem so real and no matter how strange they are, I am immersed in them.  Once I wake up and explain the dream to someone else, the information sounds almost funny and it has big logical holes in the story line. And I need to ask--when a dead character is trying to give someone a heads up about something, why do they are they speaking in riddles--Out with it man--tell me what you want me to know--don't give me silly riddles.<br /><br />The book is supposed to be entertaining, and it is.  I think it is a mindless book to read when you are trying to relax at night or when sitting on a beach sipping a beer.  I do think that it certainly isn't the best novel Steven King has written.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|What can I say. It seems the reason this series was so popular is because it hits so close to home. Peg and Al's humor is sort of like Seinfeld in that it just doesn't seem to get old.
B00D2ZF24O|5.0|this is definitely a family movie. It's made for family and it's great for a family night, kids and adults will love it.
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|This is a great movie.  Wonderful characters. Good scenery. There was actually a story in it.  Very enjoyable.  Thank you.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|This CD is amazing. First off, it is more than just another \\"Pop\\" album, and the lyrics are fantastic. To the reviewers who say this is a copy off of their other stuff, I disagree extremely. A Fever You can't Sweat Out, was theatrical yes, but it wasn't solely about Vegas, where the band started, and where Brendon and Spencer are from. None of their albums have sounded the same, they are very diverse. The lyrics do though have as much if not more meaning than the other albums, that is one thing that is the same. Give it a listen, I guarantee it'll be worth it. Kudos to you P!ATD for making another album that I want to spend all of my money on.
B000002GVO|5.0|My Wife and I like all of the eagles music, it reminds us of a bygone era when we dated.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is awesome so un-putdownable the ending will shock you and make you go wow why did that happen.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie is at the top of my kids to watch movie. Good movie,  good picture, great sound. Kids were very happy
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game its so fun.but it needs to be easier to get acorns. but other wise I love it
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love, love, love! Beautiful voice and sound. Michael and one of the best singers and I am a huge fan. Truly one of a kind.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King seems to be getting better.  This story kept me up late turning pages like the King of old.  It's often I finish a good story, it's rare that I finish a book so good, I'm actually sad it's over.  This is one of the rarities.  I'm already looking for King's next book.  Thanks for a great story!!
0756404746|5.0|I read a review on EW and decided to pick this book up, then I couldn't put it down and read the second one just as fast. Rothfuss better get working on the third.
