B00APUQRPC|2.0|The writing was mundane at best. If you can't count on Clint what can you count on for a movie?
B009M06JO0|5.0|Slayer come through again. Just kicks your ass from beginning to end without letting go. If you truly love fast metal, get this album!
B0063IH60K|1.0|When I figure out how to remove this, I will.  I really enjoy playing this on my computer, but it is not as good on the Kindle.  Also, I should have known there was a &#34;catch&#34; to a &#34;free&#34; download.  Everytime a new game starts, there is an advertisement, most of the time for &#34;singles&#34;...!!!!!! I am 66 years old, and definitely not interested in &#34;singles&#34;!!!!!!!!!nor am I interested in putting up with these annoying ads!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton combines family drama and mystery into a masterfully written novel that moves seamlessly through past and present and proves loves ability to heal the soul.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Once I got started, I could not really put the book down.  I liked it so much for its Real-Science based story line that I bought a copy for my wife.  She loved it also!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This story is, above all else, a love story.  It shows examples of love in so many forms and demonstrates how sometimes the deepest and most committed love can come from the place where it is least expected.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I put this on my wife's Kindle Fire and she uses it on there more than her Laptop. It is a great social app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|if u like to read love stories, this will be ur book!!!<br />I enjoy reading this book from beginning to the end!<br />The story of Eva & Gideon is amazing!!!!!!! 8)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Regular clock functions except.. get this!! It has the ability to take songs from your music library and randomly play them upon waking!<br />How cool is that?!  Very.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I love this game...very addicting..I wish that you could get more gems though, when I can't solve a puzzle and have no gems for hlep, it makes me NOT want to play anymore.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Well I loved the first book but you know how after  first books you want more,and how third books you are anxious to read the ending. Well the third does not have emotional feeling. Otherwise  I love the series!!!!
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Dear Life struck me as too much &#34;more of the same&#34; from Munro. She is a skillful short story writer but I think she may be losing  her mojo. These stories all seemed to blend together. After I finished one, it faded swiftly from my memory. In fact, if I suspended reading in the middle of a story, I found that I had to backtrack in order to remember who the characters were and exactly what the story was about!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't stop reading them can't wait for the next two movies<br />Gets better and better with each book you got to read it.
B005NNURES|4.0|I have to admit that I think this is the worst album that Pink Floyd put out. At the time of it's release I was upset that the group would break up with the release. Then again, the worst Pink Floyd album is better than the average group's best album...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A lot of sex....amazing fantasy sex....but an amazing story as well! Love,fear,sex,passion! Good read, about to buy the last one bittersweet :)
B005LAJ17M|4.0|The development of the characters is unusually skillful.  The story line moves very quickly.  I could do with less gore, but that's TV these days.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|An American classic. What's not to like? This is a tale of love, life, childhood... it is easy to see why this is a classic.
0765325950|1.0|I signed on this morning to purchase the ebook since I am on the road traveling. Since I can't buy it as an ebook I am going to wait till  one of my friends finish their hardcover and just borrow and read theirs. Lost sale on TORs part for failing to release the ebook at the same time as the HC. No reason for the publish to try and live in a fantasy land like many of their books.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|It is great. I can not figure out how to follow someone though. Besides that it works fine.I like it.
B00008G8LG|5.0|I got the old version of this movie and had a hard time wading through all the music. This is done excellently.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The first Nicholas Sparks novel that I have read, I will definitely have to read more.  Once I started reading,  I did not want to put it down.  Loved, loved it.  I highly recommend if you are looking for an easy, entertaining, suspenseful read.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great book did not want it to end. It was like I was there<br />Great characters and an unbelievably great story
0446554995|5.0|For months, I've been waiting! I've read every Pendergast book Mr. Preston & Mr. Child have written and by far this is the best! Well written, as usual, and extremely intriguing. I honestly can't wait until the next adventure in Pendergast's world. I'm reading this book slowly because when I finish it, I won't have anything interesting to read for a while as none of my favorite authors have anything in the works at the moment. So get cracking guys! I'll soon need my Pendergast fix!!!!!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I like Tom Selleck and I didn't know he made so many of the Jesse Stone movies. I purchased all of them up to Benefit of the Doubt. This is the second movie and they have a good plot. I can't wait to watch the rest.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Soundgarden has done it once again, releasing a brilliant studio album filled with awesome riffs, wailing vocals, haunting melodies, and euphoric interludes. This album for me is reminiscent of Down On The Upside. In fact it seems to be a perfect next step in terms of album releases for the band, which is impressive considering the amount of time between Down On The Upside and King Animal. I believe the first single,\\"Been Away Too Long\\", while a good track is actually the weakest on the album. It is not a great representation of the vibe of the album, so do not let it sway you in terms of creating a preconceived notion of what to expect. The album is filled with amazing songs. My personal favorites are \\"Non-State Actor\\", \\"Blood On The Valley Floor\\", \\"Taree\\", and \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\". All are exceptional tracks that stand up with any of Soundgarden's previous songs.  Not just a great Soundgarden album but in my opinion one of the best, if not the best, rock album released in 2012. Great to have Soundgarden back and still releasing amazing music. Now stop reading this and get the album!
B0091LS07E|4.0|was expecting an actual plastic CD case. got a paper jacket instead. the cd is amazing and so is alicia keys but the paper jacket seems cheap. also i hate it that the original girl on fire is not included!
B0046IGOIO|4.0|Some great songs on this CD, but I don't think they needed to have all of the talking between songs. Still worth hearing the Doors doing anything live.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A childhood favorite and even more  of a favorite today.  Time  we're simpler and things that were really important  had value.  I wish people today were not  like those in this book.  The story is magnificent and  timeless. The characters are wonderful.  This book is delightful.  Must read.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|This may be the raunchiest movie I've ever seen, but my wife and I loved every minute of it. Worth renting just to hear the things that come out of the teddy bear's mouth.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For anyone that has ever missed a loved one that has died or wondered wht happens when we die (and who hasn't?) this book offers comfort.  I want to read over and over.  Bought copies for all of my family to read.
B0090S4AJU|5.0|I was a huge fan of this band since their first cd which i thought was an excellent debut for a new pop group. But this new cd just blows that one completely out of the water. This is a fun pop album with very few ballads and lots of danceable tracks. Fun for any age. This was definitely one of my top 10 favorite albums of 2012. Do yourself a favor and pick up this album and have one heck of a dance party.
B0086700CM|5.0|Simple yet fun! Fast paced with simple controls. Great game, we need more like this one!! Best part about it is its free!!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is very polished! Excellent graphics and sound wrapped around a fun concept of sliding pudding around the table in varying puzzles. Earning 3 stars on each puzzle is very addicting. Lots of cool new gameplay elements come into the game as you progress to keep the pudding fresh.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|As a Tom Clancy fan from the beginning, this novel continues the Jack Ryan storyline through his son, Junior.<br />I read this in four days over Christmas and found it  moves forward at a good clip, padding out the storyline and bringing the story to life. The plot line ebbs and flows and I found my self waiting for the action to start- and it does!
B0067R0APK|4.0|When I was looking for one with good radar maps especially.  This app fills the bill admirably.  The screens and graphics are great.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was very entertaining and enjoyable to read. The vivid descriptions and accounts given by each of the characters in the book  along with the ideas and feasibility of the scenario itself make for a very captivating read. Two thumbs up!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game is a great game.  it is a little pricey though. I was. debating weather or not to get this game because some people said it wasn't as good as mc3. it is way better don't listen to them. the multiplayer runs smoother and Sos does the campaign. the way you can coustomizze your weapons is awesome too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|best app game out there hands down never get tired of it played it since it was ever released. Game developers also listen to their fans and update constantly with new stuff
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I heard this movie was not as good as the previous ones, but after watching it, I liked it.  My 10 year old thought it was funny.  Good choice for movie night.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am a 57 year old grandma and like to explore new games. This one is a great past time I like exploring the new games. Most are easy e<br />nough to complete. prices to open new<br />ones kind of steep but thats just my opinion
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thouroughly enjoyed the trilogy.  My my my, where did she do her research?  Ha Ha  Loved them all, hated to see the end.  Rereading all 3 books incase I missed something.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my son, because I know that he likes Peter Gabriel's &#34;So&#34; and &#34;Us&#34; albums.  When I saw my son later, he said he wasn't expecting much, because concert movies generally don't interest him, and the songs don't live up to the original recordings.  But he was riveted by this Blue-ray, and he was impressed by both the concert and the features.  We had a great discussion about the quality of the performance and the inventiveness of the staging.  As a gift, it made me look like I actually knew what I was doing!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Great continuation from the first. We get to learn more about the mysterious Christian Grey, with a lot less erotica. The ending is a cliffhanger and definitely want to read \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\".
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I reckon that this is one of the best books. It's really grabs your attention and draws you in. The characters and the way the play it out. It's amazing<br /><br />I like everything about this book.<br />This is a must read book<br />Please read this book.<br /><br />I know you'll enjoy it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought the book want too bad. It was not what I expected, very intense. I would recommend it though.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Seriously? This is the best thing going!<br /><br />If I am using 'Tunein' or 'Shazam' on my phone, and I hear a song I like, I can just click on the little Icon and amazon Mp3 looks it up and BOOM, I have it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have tons of fun playing this game. Great graphics &amp; stuff. Only thing I don't like would probably be the need for internet.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|works well in time for xmas sounds great, weel put together,xc x x x x x x x x x
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Muy buen producto, total satisfaccion y seguridad para el cuidado del bebe.<br />Excelente. Gracias por crear cosas tan útiles para el bienestar
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Although there were some instances that i did not like not agree with, the story ourselves very entertaining. This book it's for a vacation read or something leisurely, but it isn't much more than just that.
B00466HM28|5.0|what is this thing? a piano? a computer? a gizmo? it's great! it's so small and really easily accessible. one of my teens wanted to play around with composing and making music.. this was the right price and he set it up on his computer in minutes. he really enjoys it. pretty great little gadget. or instrument. or computer...
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|there is nothing like being scared to death almost.I was telling my daughter about the show, and now she wants to see it too.
0226443213|5.0|this is non-fiction that reads like some crazy story someone made up. it's one of those &#34;can't look away&#34; moments in US history. got it for a gift for someone that likes to read this sort of disaster/news/history type of book and he loves it.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|We loved this movie. Very convenient through Amazon. Some vulgar language adds shock value to the humor but I would say it isn't for young or sensitive people.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Interesting movie and great acting.  Good Story.<br />I have already told my friends to watch this movie.<br />Feel Good movie
B005CWRB44|5.0|Outstanding quality and power from a pocket flashlight. I have used it a lot during the process of installing Christmas lights. Impressed my friends too. Fenix is the best choice for a small light. I'll probably get another.
B005PK553C|5.0|The first time I tried watching it I couldn't get past the first episode b/c of my weird inability to deal with witnessing people commit adultery, or even have it be a reference point. So after watching it about a year or so later and getting past the nauseating infidelity I found this show delightfully imaginative and dark. I can \\"call\\" a lot of things in other movies and shows and yes, I could call some things in this show, however I was pleasantly surprised a lot.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Find this book very enlightening and scary because you can become so ill so quickly, with no little or no warnings
B003ZSJ212|5.0|As any Star Wars Fan knows, you can't beat the Theatrical Releases of Episodes IV-VI, however taking that with a grain of salt, the Blu_Rays for these movies look fantastic.  Doing a side by side comparison of the Blu-Ray versus the DVD on an Upconversion DVD player, the winner is clear.  The Blu-Rays just flat out look better.  The packaging is some of the best that I've seen for a gift set.  This box houses 9 Discs and still comes in smaller than the Dark Knight Trilogy Box Set.  I would still however wait for this to go on sale.  I got this for 60 dollars, and would not pay the normal 150 dollar asking price for this product given that you can only buy Star Wars so many times, haha.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Decent movie but the others were better.  Wasn't even scary or twisted as others have been.  I would recommend if you just want to kill some time.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Purchased this knife a few months back, and there's no regrets.  High quality product.  Will defer to the better reviews on here, as it was due to them that we got it for batoning wood and such.  Its been holding up like a wolf in the darkness that's for damn sure.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Five stars just for Carol of the Bells.<br /><br />There are a couple of good songs, and the rest are missing the PTX spirit and are just meh.
B008CLI3TE|2.0|I've always loved fantasy, and I thought I'd love this, but I hated it. It's all politics and no adventure. Every character says exactly what they're thinking except when lying to set up a power play. And virtually every conversation involves one character insulting another by referencing the fact that he or she is a dwarf, eunuch, whore, bastard, or foreigner.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I am an introvert and am pleased the world is in the infant stages of seeing our value.  Maybe books like these will help open the worlds eyes.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|O.k., I just started on this book and the first thought I have is; if Christian bought her all these clothes, why does she continue to wear Kate's plum dress to everything?  Apparently she did not take anything with her when she broke it off, but seriously, what woman does that?  Dang...does Kate have any more clothes?  At least this book did not start as slow as the first one.  I don't like how the first ended, but I guess it was the best way to ensure the purchase of \\"Darker\\".  Though, if I had not got the entire set as a Xmas gift, I honestly may have not purchased the next two.  Anastacia is receiving all the concessions she is asking for so I don't know why all the whining.  Hopefully, all will be revealed soon.  Anywho....back to it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book made me experience every emotion possible. The characters were so captivating that you are hooked from the beginning. Looking forward to more from this author, loved her style!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Fantastic, great video, this was a gift for my brother, who is a die hard fan of the Stones, and he enjoyed dvd.  Said it was great to be able to see theses famous musicians!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Interesting but a little too much non-constructive detail. Should move a little faster and plot is a little slow and hard to follow.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Fantastic cd, I can't wait to purchase new one.  These guys are such a talent and their interpretation of the music was outstanding. I will continue to purchase any cd's that they make. Amazing performers!
1612930425|2.0|Wow is this book boring.  Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.<br /><br />PAINFUL!!!!!<br /><br />The book is filled with rich people being super proper.  Oh my goodness it was bad.<br /><br />Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it.  Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.<br /><br />There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like \\"Why, doesn't she look pretty today?\\" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.<br /><br />The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.<br /><br />Done.<br /><br />I just couldn't handle it.<br /><br />But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.<br /><br />So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
0316228532|4.0|To be truthful, I wanted to see how JKR wrote when it was not Harry Potter. She does write well, she has got a very good grip on real people and real problems and she has excellent insight into the thoughts and reactions of men and women, rich and poor, young and old. She creates characters that become interesting, you end up liking or disliking them. It turned out to be one of those books which you want to get back to until you find out what happened. In short, I liked the book and recommend it.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Excellent story, very realistic based on what I have gleaned from &#34;true life&#34; stories from the people who fought the Nazis from behind the lines.  I am an avid follower of Mr. Follett.  I particularly like his leap from mystery to near true stories about Europe in the middle ages etc.
B000FC10HA|5.0|Easy, quick read that I can apply today. Worth the time - you will definitely take away something for your work.
0307730697|5.0|I first heard about Adam Brown on my local Christian radio channel, \\"Faith 1190 AM\\".  Kelley Brown was being interviewed about the book, and her tears moved me; heck, compelled me to learn Adam's story. I am not an avid reader by any means, but I couldn't put the book down.  I read it in a weekend.  Even though I knew how the book and Adam's life ends, somehow I wished it was going to end differently, and he would make it home to Kelley and the kids.  I feel like I know Adam, Kelley, and Adam's parents Larry and Janice.  Because of this book, I am now going to read \\"Tender Warrior\\" by Stu Weber.  This was the last book Adam was reading, and I plan on applying that to my life too.  Thanks Eric Blehm for a great book about a great man. Thanks, Adam for your life and sacrafice. We all miss you.
0765325950|1.0|It's the only way to get the attention of publishers everywhere. It's 2013 and I won't kill trees for books anymore. This is a disgrace and tor and Harriet, if this truly is her as well, should be ashamed.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|So glad to see this game made it to the Kindle. Loved the PC version but this is even better.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My grandaughter received the Big Bang Theory for christmas. Loves it. She received all three series. The first, second  and  third  series. She also got series #4
B001HN69AY|5.0|very interesting and visually stimulating. not like any movie i have ever seen before. definitely more than worth its price.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play at least 3 times a day.  Only issue is that I get that it isn't responding sometimes.  But really like.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great game but needs the new update for world tour new york when is kindle gonna get it everything else has it already
B006YTTVHO|2.0|The. Contents of this book aren't anything new.  It's mostly common sense. Not bad for free. Just glad it didn't cost.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game do much that I play it 24-7. It's better than the boring old temple run. Love this game. It's the bom.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Don't ask me why, but I just never got onto the bandwagon for Downton Abbey. I began reading about the series and downloaded it from Amazon. Season 1, then 2 and a weekend went by without my seeing daylight. This series is so spectacular! The acting is superb, the costumes and sets are incredible. The story is riveting! Thank goodness I finished in time for Series 3.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Best game ever.  I play it multiple times a day.  Each puzzle is a new challenge. Very similar to bejeweled
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I bought this book for my niece for Christmas and decided I should maybe read it as well, so that I could recommend it with a clear conscience! I am so glad I did. The writing it perfect for middle graders, but smart and well-written enough that I enjoyed it as an adult. Some of the things I loved were the references to other books, songs, poems, movies, etc. As a kid, I loved things like this because then I explored those references and found so many other things to love - and this book mentions The Hobbit, Dragon Rider, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and others.<br /><br />But obviously the best part is the story itself. It is a beautiful story of friendship, acceptance, survivial, and LOVE. Yes, I shed tears, but I am a better person for it. I have now recommended this book to my whole family - but every kid, and every parent should read it. And then the whole planet. Seriously.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|I'm a big Who fan so had been looking forward to this for quite some time. Like Clapton's autobiography, this offers a fascinating look into one of rock's great figures.<br />Though I was surprised that there was no mention of CSI.
B0055OG2BC|1.0|Other than being a spoof of James Bond there is no reason for this movie.  It's too boring to be even considered bad.
0307744434|5.0|This book is magical and wonderful and one of the best I have read in a long time.  I think that what one needs to understand - and maybe this is a spoiler in one sense - but I don't think so - is that the Circus itself is the protagonist of the book.  This book, named as such is all about the Circus itself.  The people are the action because a thing is necessarily passive, and so much of the plot revolves around the implications of the Circus' creation spreading out both forward and backward.  It is a love story, but not necessarily of Marco and Celia - the love story is the Circus.  I am in love with that Circus.  I wish to be a Reveure and dress in black/white/grey with red accents.  Sigh.  Above all else this book is romantic.<br /><br />This is not an action book.  It is as much a meditation as it is a story.  I am so sad this book ended. I will reread it certainly.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I am so glad to add this to our collection! Love Sigorney weaver and all the alien movies. and it came on time!!!
6305433909|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't a blockbuster hit by any means.  It was a decent follow up the the first one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|it came on time, and I love adele, the music is awesome. what a wonderful cd. I listen to it in the car all the time.......
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|First, I'd like to say that overall, I liked the book.  What I didn't appreciate however is how Pendergast was altered for it.  Different situations bring out different responses in everyone, but the character's behavior sat on the very edge of unbelievable.  Having said that, I finished the book with the distinct feeling that this book was the last starring Agent Pendergast.
068817776X|5.0|I am a huge fan of Holocaust novels and have read quite a few, but they tend to follow similar plots and have predictable endings.  This, however, was a refreshing and compelling book, and I loved it!  It's great for Middle or High Schoolers.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Time travel is a risky buisness.  In my opinion, only a handfull of author's have been able to pull off writing about it.  Unfortunatly King, for me, didn't do a great job.  He's still an excellent authour in my eyes and as long as he writes, I'll contine to read his material.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My kids really loved this movie so much I may want to purchase this movie, this was one of the better Disney movies.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|My first Ken Follett novel was surprisingly good.  Understand that this comes from an English major not normally attracted  to historical fiction.  Looking forward to the next...hope it holds up.
0525953728|2.0|Just could not get into this book. Written ok, but just not one of those &#34;cannot put down&#34; writes I usually like with military books.
0765325950|1.0|To delay the release of the ebook is an extremely poor business decision - I do most of my reading through audible.com since most of my free reading time comes during my commute to work, however, I will be at a 3 day swim meet this weekend and was looking forward to spending some of that time doing some traditional reading. I was so excited thinking I would have this book available - I'de be able to listen on the drive, then actually read between swim events for my daughter and during our down time in the hotel room - that clearly won't be happening, since it's not available for my kindle and I will not drag a humongous hard back book into bleacher seats to sit for 4 hours - nor will I purchase the book AFTER I have already listened to the whole thing - Get with the times publishers, print media is a thing of the past, and you will eventually go the way of the failing newspapers and magazines if you refuse to adapt and change you business model.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's been a long while since I've read a book that kept my interest from start to finish.  It's probably the fastest I've ever read a book and that's saying a lot.  I'm a bit of a slow reader and it took me about a five days to read this.  I know that may seem like a long time to some people but for me it's like warp speed!!!  I felt lots of emotion while in the grips of this novel and I highly recommend it!
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Awesome songs, it's a different spin on today's sound.  Great vibe, great lyrics...all around a fun (excuse the pun) CD.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Quality of streaming was great and movie itself was outstanding!!! Amazon streaming service always works great and the value of each rental is very competitive with the price of rentals through cable television. The only thing I would suggest is for them to add a subtitle service along with their television and movie streaming.
1612931103|5.0|A clean transaction.  I got this for my fiance's son, who needs guidance in writing contract proposals.  It was the fastest most succinct route to English proficiency I could think of.
0394800184|5.0|This was one of my favorite picture books when I was little, and now I get to read it to my children. I love the simple, adorable pictures. My daughter loves all the animals in the book, and my son loves it when I make a loud \\"SNORT\\" noise. The animals talk so you can make funny voices for them. It's great that the scary \\"snort\\" turns out to be the hero. My son is four and my daughter is two, and they both love it.
0765325950|1.0|I've waited for a long time for this book to come out. I followed the progress on Sanderson's web site. I was excited about the January 8th release date and when I went to the amazon site to download the book I find out that I have to wait till April.  I have never written a review but I decided to follow the example of so many other WOT readers who are angry about the delay in releasing the e-book by giving a one star review and I encourage others who are upset about this to do the same. With enough one star reviews maybe Tor will get the message.
0756686970|5.0|Got this for my 6 year old twin grandsons and even my 34 and 32 year old sons loved it.  Grandsons spent hours looking through it.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I loved the book as always. The beginning of the book traps you and you can't put it down. Then it starts to get a bit to technical  which is a little boring.
B009JBZH54|5.0|So excited.  My sons are a great fan of these movies and are anxious to watch it.  Good present. thanks.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Are we all supposed to imagine she killed herself or murdered him???? This book was good but the ending really sucked.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found it very hard to put down. Very pleased with my choice of reading, now on to book three
0765325950|1.0|My bookshelves are full, my patience is non-existent. If you do not publish an eBook at release, then you are not worth a dime. Go to hell Tor.
159420411X|2.0|What a tremendous disappointment. I actually picked this book up in late Sept. but after reading the introduction I put the book away disgusted by the gross historical inaccuracies. I figured I come back to it when I was in a better mood and the book wasn't intended to be a history book so I gave Nate the benefit of the doubt that he was more knowledgeable concerning statistics. I picked the book up again in Jan. assuming I'd read it but only made it half-way through. \\"whiteelephant's\\" review is spot on. Nate is a good mathematician who got lucky at the right time. Dem's fell in love with him because he told them of their impending gains in 2012. Now to many people criticizing Nate is seen as supporting Republicans but these folks don't really understand Nate. He's a center-right conservative who loves free-market solutions based on ideology alone, not proven performance. Read whiteelephants review since it quite accurate and it would be redundant for me to write my criticisms since they mirror his (hers?).
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Perfect for me, drive 300 to 500 miles a day , at the end of the day just put the bluetooth in the case and it charges it in maybe 20 minutes, charge on the case has lasted more than a week before recharging. can't go wrong wiith this one!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love the Mitch Rapp books. There were a few hints in this book of what might happen to Mitch in the future. I am waiting for the next Rapp mission!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love fairy tales, and Once Upon a Time spins the best back stories for my favorite characters!  Who knew these folks all lived in the same relative neighborhood?  This is a great series, full of humor, magic, scary stuff and love stories without any gore, senseless violence (okay, ripping hearts out of chests is pretty violent - at least they look plasticy and glow when they're out) or blatant sex.  I can't wait for each episode, and cheer on my heroes and boo the bad guys.<br /><br />I give it two thumbs up and stellar ratings!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is definitely a &#34;who done it story&#34; with a twist. From the beginning some one knows who did it. Will he tell? To get out of prison of course but you have to wait and see. Great book.
B004IYISSK|4.0|A lovely book with a variety of characters, delving into the problems and achievements of an exchange of language and culture. It shows just how strong the women is this country are whilst being practically ignored.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter who is 11. She watches it all the time and thinks it AWESOME!
B003G4W49C|5.0|We follow the Ender journey through his eyes and perspectives during whole years until he \\"won\\" the War with the buggers.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Very short story. Good story but less than one typical chapter, wish I had known that before buying it. Good story
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This game is fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it. I actually purchased it on a whim after reading a review on Kotaku.com. I am glad I did.<br /><br />I would compare this game to an interactive choose-your-own adventure book. There is a lot of text and a lot of reading. The graphics are basic comic book-style and there isn't much animation. However, that's all part of the charm of the game. The story is incredibly well written and exciting. You never know what's going to happen next. The characters are unique and interesting. Each playthrough revealed a bit more about each one.<br /><br />Multiple playthroughs is a must and you won't mind doing it either. After the first completion, you can \\"fast forward\\" any text you've already seen and it will automatically stop you at a decision or new text. It's a great way to encourage multiple play attempts.<br /><br />The puzzles are well designed and difficult but not impossible. I never needed a guide to solve any of them. I just needed some clever thinking. There is a nice variety in the puzzles as well. One time you might be programming the path of a crate-pushing machine to clear a path. In another you might be looking at clues to discover the passcode to a door. In a third you might be combining items to get a clue that you need to use a machine to unlock a desk drawer containing a key!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this game to anyone owning a Nintendo DS. Also, there is some mature language, some mature themes/violence and sexual innuendo so it's not a game for kids.
0938045768|2.0|I find it odd that the author claims to have done a dozen one-arm unsupported handstand push-ups and all the other exercises in the book, yet is nowhere to be seen performing the exercises, any exercises, neither in his book nor on-line. If you, as the author, were the shining example of your method's effectiveness, wouldn't you want to demonstrate that fact? I certainly would.<br /><br />I also find the reasoning behind his training plan highly flawed. In order to work up to the most difficult movements, the author has you doing sets of 40 reps with easier variations. But that's like doing sets of 40 on the bench press or squat in order to increase your one rep max. It's like running 3 miles to improve your 50 yard sprint time. It doesn't work like that. You'll never find Olympic lifters, sprinters, or power lifters using high rep endurance training to develop explosive power and maximal strength. Paul Wade should have created gradual progressions that keep the user in the appropriate rep range. That would make sense.<br /><br />I seriously doubt that this guy is the guru he claims to be.
034580404X|3.0|I couldn't get past the first 15 pages..too simple -passed on.Normally i would of started reading it from the back,, as to not &#34; waste &#34; a book, however wasn't interested enough in this one.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have bought MineCraft pocket edition for my son to play on his Kindle Fire. Unfortunately, the only thing he is able to do on it so far is only building the environment using different blocks, also he can dig down and plant mushrooms. There are no options for any kind of tools or game characters! I believe that in other versions of MineCraft there is certain interactive game content of finding, fighting and defeating the \\"bad\\" characters. The KindleFire pocket app doesn't have a manual neither does it provide any additional information on how to find more things. I was hoping that my son would be able to play this game either by himself or with friends, when the device either is wirelessly connected or not. I would appreciate if anyone can give us any suggestions on how to get more out of this game... Until then, I would give this game 2 stars only for its high price and limited capabilities!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|it has amazing graphics and a good story. G5 always has great games. I really enjoy them. works really well on my kindle. I got this for free but will be glad to pay for extended version.
B003K16P3M|4.0|This was a pretty good read. The characters were interesting. The plot seemed well thought out. It just wasn't particularly spectacular. By that, I mean that it wasn't out of the ordinary amazing in my opinion. Still, it is fairly good and certainly worth a read.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Can't beat the freebies, bought the kindle fire for my daughter and she loves these free game apps! Not much else to say, Its free after all!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I have already started to use some of the things I learned from this book.  My favorite is the 20 second rule...you will have to read it yourself to find out what it is.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn and this new book did not disappoint.<br />At first I was upset because it seemed too good to be true, then the dark side came. Can't wait for another book from her!
0765325950|4.0|To everyone complaining on no digital e-book.<br /><br />Far from looking to buy an e-book version;  I decided, without even glancing at the options, to buy a full hard cover physical paper copy.  Why?  Because when I started reading this series it was curled up in bed, 2am in the morning on a school night, feverishly flipping from one page to the next.  I can not think of a better way of finally finishing this series than the way I started all those years ago.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy the game of mahjong. It is relaxing to me. I recommend Mahjong to anyone who wants a game that challenges them yet is fun too.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|the tutorials didn't really help in explaining the game. Easily beaten though. I did like the cat and mouse game theme.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. And being in HD just makes it all the more enjoyable. Good video and audio.
B006AX6ONI|4.0|Repetitive messages, but overall it's a good, easy read for a cheap price. Seven more words required. Ok. I'm done.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is one of the best shows out right now! Love it! . . . . . . . .
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Like order I will order again if needed. It was a gift for my sister it's great purchase thank you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Absolutely amazing book, wonderful story that captured me and allowed me top experience grand tale. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|Like order I will order again if needed. It was a gift for my sister it's great purchase thank you.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|I am a huge fan of the MIB and MIB2 films and have watched both many, many times. I suppose I am going down the same watching road with MIB3 having seen it in the theater and at home once. MIB3 is disappointing, however. The humor is weaker and while Josh Brolin does a great job as a younger Tommy Lee, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones both show their age. It's not their actual physical age but instead that their performance just seems tired.<br /><br />If you're a MIB fan, the movie is worth buying - just don't have super expectations.<br /><br />MAJOR ALERT: the Blu Ray transfer sucks. The colors on the actors faces are off at times to the extent I found it distracting since it was not that way in the theater.
6305433909|5.0|Like order I will order again if needed. It was a gift for my sister it's great purchase thank you.
B005LAII12|5.0|was a very funny  movie  laughed so much and will watch it again and will tell all my friends it is a must see
B00932AA5G|5.0|This movie was very good. ACTION pact leaving you wondering through each event, \\" How is he going to get out of this situation now?\\" It came together so well at the end and had a great story. Loved it!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|That was one of the most epic books I have read. I can't wait to read the next book of Katness
B005LAII08|5.0|My daughter wanted this movie for Christmas.  It was only a little more of a cost to get the five-disc collector's edition. She gave us one of the blu-ray discs to use at our home and kept the Blu-ray 3D for herself.  It is a great movie too!
B004ISVH7U|4.0|My wife was very happy to get this cd/dvd. she enjoys the oldies and attended  a simon and garfunkle concert just after the release of the album.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game.. I like how it's free but it takes forever to get diamonds. Fix that..and I'll play it FOREVER
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoyed this game on my phone so much, I downloaded it to my Kindle.  Awesome!!!  I get lost in this game.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Best movie of 2012. For a movie about a paraplegic, it was absolute joy, thanks to the two leads whose chemistry was perfect. Couldn't wait to see it again and it was just as good the second time.
B001VNB54A|4.0|I like the show so far, it has alot of action and whatnot but it is lacking a connection to me, before in band of brothers there was a connection to the enemy and you got to understand them more, but with the Japanese you dont get to see much, maybe that is apart of the story because it was gorilla warfare.... still great though, same thing just a different place from Band of Brothers though
B0034EEE2E|4.0|Pleasant...<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br />Zebra<br />10 Mile Stereo<br />Walk in the Park<br />Silver Soul<br /><br />This effort grows on me...I have often let &#34;Teen Dream&#34; play over and over...serving as a sound-track for whatever I am working on...
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|What I loved about this movie is it seemed to be a real expression of Jane Austen's intent.  It had the wit, the humor and all the seriousness of the issues of their day involved.  As always, character is the real issue...
B004ZN9YNC|3.0|With some exceptionally stand out moments throughout. When this first came out and of course a lot of us bought it on the tail of The Wall.<br />The subject matter of most songs does give you the impression these are left over from The Wall. Here it is 30+ years later and probably that long since I've listened to The Final Cut.<br />Absolutely fantastic album, guess I was just a bit snobbish in those days getting into bands like Iron Maiden, etc. What do stand out are Waters using the backup singers from his future projects.<br />Guess it took all these years for me to add The Final Cut to be listed with the other ones Meddle, Dark Side, Wish You Were, Animals, The Wall as their greatest period.
0736063684|4.0|Great, it was as advertised, and competitively priced against other products that I saw. I would purchase from this site again
B008IJTFYW|5.0|i really like all the different combinations of sounds you can put together &amp; the pre-made ones provided.  best ap for sleep challenged people like me
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Def a page turner. Colleen is very good at making you feel the characters emotions. The events in this book are mind blowing! I couldn't but it down and finished it in 2 days! I'm sad I couldn't drag it out a little longer:(
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This item arrived quickly, was as described and was exactly what I needed for my Kindle Fire!  I recommend it.
B000C20VPA|5.0|It was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, it's one of his favorite movies.  It came on time and in perfect condition, he also thinks I paid more for it than I really did =D
B004SIP71M|4.0|it was a veery good movie giving insight into the life of nuns and a ppriest.  the acting was excellrnt
B004WR125O|5.0|Small compact and unobtrusive, works well in the back USB slot in my NR-717 receiver.  Doesn't work in my BD-SP809.  In the receiver it only shows internerd radio channels, not TV or movie channels like Netflix (or at least I haven't figured either of these out yet...)
7885255921|4.0|it would've been perfect if not for the Japanese words on the DVD and Japanese singing. Other then that good enough.
B000TERD6G|5.0|Her first album, includes a lot of the songs (re-recorded) from her demo tape that Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour famously took into EMI in person.  Apparently Dave G (as Kate has referred to him in the credits on most of her albums since) also paid for re-recording the demos first.  Think he got his money back, somehow...
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger he did amazing job. I like Colin Farrell he's a great actor. But I thought it would go right along with The book.
B0051G71VE|5.0|If you're as big a Kate Bush fan as me, you'll probably have bought this on vynil, CD and now MP3.  Come on Kate, release your albums as lossless FLACs as well and I'll buy them a fourth time :-)
146500632X|5.0|My daughter received this as a Christmas present and the boys were up on the wall before noon on Christmas.<br /><br />Great photos, room to write on the days and it's a nice size. She loves it.
B0083GDLL8|5.0|Happy birthday David.  Anyway, a classic Bowie album if you're a fan from the side like me - hard rock guys aren't supposed to like Bowie, right?  Wrong.
B00540G3G6|5.0|I've always been a fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Having Blue Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo is fantastic! We can watch it anywhere now. Happy kids, happy mom.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Loved this game.  Just wish I could fully complete a mystery before paying! Overall, it's a fun game. The puzzles are especially clever!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Awesomeness<br />This is a great movie I love it it has so much suspense and the end has a surprise
B004X80QNG|4.0|I loved the app for my kindle fire up until a few days ago.  Suddenly it stopped working!  The only thing it allows me to do now is force close!  I've been waiting hoping that it suddenly starts working again I don't want to start over.  Guess I will have to ad I haven't had a response from amazon or PI yet saying it can be fixed.
0765325950|5.0|I finally know how it ends.  Ahhh.....thank the Light!  Probably the best of the three Sanderson WoT books - heck, it is the best of them all.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gideon and Eva's story gripped my heart with such power, I had no choice but to feel how human and real they are. We all ache for their connection and are starved to find the one person who sees our scars and loves us anyway.
B002YDYKGG|3.0|Brittle plastic, second set I had to buy. For the money I guess it's okay. They break pretty easy in the winter time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it has good grafics and you can do or build anything #1 recommended I highly suggest getting this don't forget to build a house first
0446571415|5.0|As with all the Camel Club books it is a soda pop read but fun and entertaining.  I enjoy reading these between heavier topics.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Not sure if i should be rating the movie or the quality of the product.<br /><br />Although I like all sciFi, this one wasn't as good as expected from the previews, but it was still good.<br /><br />The product (the DVD) was in perfect condition as you would expect of a new disc. Got in on sale for $8+.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addicting!!! Can't stop playing! Good for a long car ride. A little show at first but then you get hooked.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I play on my Kindle and I have problem with very small writing and it just wasn't fun.  Didn't find it interesting.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|really good got to level 26 really need use ur brain very addictive only one thing if u get stuck on level for too long there is no way to go on to anouther<br /> level once past level 16
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I love Angry birds and thought this was going to be like past ones but it wasn't.  I tried to play it but didn't like it at all went back to my old seasons.
B009CGLO3K|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  Glad that I bought it I will be watching it again, you always miss something the first time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read all three books in a few weeks, and they are totally worth it, great storyline, like nothing else.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|This is one you shouldn't miss. It is needed for anyone looking to improve themselves. It help me a-lot personally.
B003NX76BM|5.0|It sure was not the ending I thought it would be. It was a great journey. Nora is a great writer
B008D19WBQ|1.0|This is a \\"buyer beware\\" situation. This Blu-ray release disappoints in that we thought we were getting a visually upgraded version of the DVD's we currently own. Alas, NOT!!! The episodes were edited from the DVD versions, losing many of the funny scenes we loved. Edited out, GONE!!! Why didn't Warner Brothers just release the Blu-ray version the way they released the DVD version? \\"Heres an idea; lets take what we have already offered and sold to our loyal fans, edit the crap out of it and re-sell it as Blu-ray\\". Really? You thought you could just slip it by and no one would notice? Who at Warner Brothers thought that this was exceptable to all the true fans of the series? Why does this happen???<br />We did not buy this set on Amazon, but instead, in our haste, purchased it locally missing out on all the reviews set forth before me. So thats shame on me. Had we waited and done our research and read the other reviews, we would NOT have put out the nearly $200.00 on this collection, but instead stayed with our DVD's. Thats shame on you Warner Brothers; we will not be fooled by you again...
B006S08RLU|5.0|Great quality, easy to rent and watch.  Excellent movie, we really enjoyed it.  I really love Amazon's instant rental feature.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I downloaded the book from one of the kindle deals. The storyline was actually very interesting and the conclusion was not expected.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Love this app. It works exactly as expected. I downloaded it because I needed a way to know when my Kindle was fully charged. This alerts me at 100% and I can easily check how much battery life is left.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Relieved to say I enjoyed the Tre album more so than the Dos. I was worried after Dos came out that Tre would disappoint, but it didn't.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Keeps me busy, different kinds of deals (Winning deals, random deals etc...) heck its free!  So, I say why not! :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|My fiance and I finally started watching The Walking Dead after so many of our friends told us we had to give it a shot.  I was reluctant because scary shows tend to get to me, but this is so much more than a horror story.  Yes there are zombies, but the story revolves around survival not just zombies popping out of closets.<br /><br />The storyline is wonderful and hooked us right away.  And they have fantastic cliff hangers at the end of each episode.  Definitely worth checking out!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I think this game is good especially for little kids. I once got hooked on it but now.that I think about it its dumb
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing you should really get it and its for free I mean that's not usually possible to get 101 games and 31 extra games and hint hint get lights out to rack up some points for me it never gives me lower than 9,000 points every time I play it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very well written!  The characters are interesting and the author does a wonderful job of weaving their stories together.  I loved it!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|An upgrade would be fabulous.  It is difficult to see beyond first few posts and does not update news feed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I only read a few pages and I am forced to do a mid book review wtf? Anyways, it's great.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The plot was slow at times.  The small scenes to tie the movie to the previous release were not well done.
1582701709|5.0|I have read this several times and I bought a few for gifts this holiday. I hope my freinds love it as much as I did.
B0013AUE3O|5.0|The music is extremely pleasant and not overly distracting.  It has proven great to drown out workplace distractions and let me focus on reading material and working on projects.
B0015DROBO|5.0|did not want to reasd this, but my daughter insisted I stay with it.  Had to get through the beginning, but then it got readdy good.  If you read and like this, you will definitely want the other two.  The last of the triogy, I think, is the best.  But be sure to read them in order.  Wish he had lived to write more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful story teller, he paints a visual image and draws you in. I have read all of his books and have never be disappointed. He is my favorite author !!!!  Not sure any filmmaker can match the intensity and passion he writes with. Looking forward to the next place he takes his readers.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|not as good as some of their other books, but still a good read.  If you like their stuff, you will probably like this
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Good time killer for those rainy days or waiting rooms.  Fun game - makes ya think - but not too hard
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've been a fan of these since the first one came out deffenatly worth the money read the books first though
B00ARAO720|4.0|It was 90's nostalgic for me. A movie that is fun and exciting and doesn't get bigger than its realistic self. Too many movies today try to be too much, this one keeps it simple.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The hunger games is a great book for teens and up. Its well written and filled in a lot of gaps the movie left.  This is a good example of why u read before you see.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This movie is fantastic! Although it does not deliver the actual &#34;concert&#34; experience, the sound quality is great has many exclusives! This is a must-have for every 1D fan!
B0086700CM|5.0|Five stars!!!! Why? This game is very fun, addictive, an  never ends. It is free and you will enjoy it. Kids and adults will love playing. Have fun with temple run brave!
0143119680|2.0|I was so excited to read this book, but it turned out to be a great disappointment and I couldnt finish it.<br /><br />The romance between Diana and Matthew manifested so quickly and easily that there really was no fun in reading it. The book is also quite repetitive, and to be honest I didnt like any character enough to care about what might happen. I simply put it down and that was it.
B00633W614|4.0|Call me unimaginative, but I hate being left to decide the fate of the protagonist! This book and the one that preceded it are fantastic and Archer has me hooked to read the next ASAP!
0307744434|4.0|There was so much hype surrounding this book that I decided I had to read it. I love fantasy fictions that involves magic, and The Night Circus was definitely an enchanting book. The imagery was beautiful and I liked the characters a lot.<br /><br />I also liked the narrative structure of the book very much, where two lines of narration slowly converge into one. However, as much as I liked various elements of this book, I was sometime confused by its story line. It was not as gripping or as fast paced as I wanted it to be, but it was still interesting enough to keep me reading until the end.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like The Night Circus was a very entertaining read, but it was not one of those books that I could not put down until the very last page was read.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very helpful it helps me do my homework and find out what to say about the future of aggressive behavior in many friends of whom I have. It was the only way to get to the public domain and shout out the right thing to say
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Reading this book actually told me what I already knew.<br /><br />In my 30's I was 20 lbs overweight and I followed the Atkins plan and lost those lbs in about three months and continued to eat more protein and fat (along with healthy greens) for years. Fast forward to my mid to late 40's. The weight came on fast and furious - my diet became mostly carbs - &#34;good&#34; (according to the &#34;experts&#34;) and bad carbs and cut down on &#34;bad&#34; meat and fat - I was under great stress and just didn't care what I ate. As a result, my doctor put me in high BP meds and cholesterol meds.<br /><br />I tried a number of &#34;popular&#34; &#34;healthy&#34; diets (which I won't name here, but search for any diet the government says is good for you), which resulted in minor weight-loss after about 3 months, or fantastic weight loss, but I still felt tired and, for lack of a better term, defeated, as in the case of the fantastic weight loss, the very, very low calorie count was not sustainable and I gained the weight back. Late last year, after I turned 50 years old, I started eating like I did in my 30's - high protein, high fat, carbs kept below 100 grams a day - lo and behold, I've lost 26 lbs, my BP is going down and my cholesterol is also going down.<br /><br />The reason I purchased this book was that I was intrigued by what I read online. I'm always in the market for new information. Every page I read, my head &#34;nodded&#34; in agreement (I caught myself physically doing this numerous times.)<br /><br />It is sometimes discouraging that there are things I will have to greatly limit in my diet, but, as the saying goes, &#34;It's not what you eat between Thanksgiving and Christmas that is the issue, it's what you eat between Christmas and Thanksgiving.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks to the reinforcement I got from this book, I will eat healthy, indulge occasionally, and live.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|I saw the first season of &#34;Twin Peaks&#34; during it's original run. It was genius then and it still holds up.
B005LAII80|5.0|i bought and watched it yest. i have a 3d tv but dont like watching 3d movies when they have black bars on the top and bottom, so i just watched it in 2d. i turned up my 7.2 and sat back,and i must say they really did a good job at this movie. very bloody and the special effects where done very well,and the soundtrack sounded more then amazing thru 7.2 surround sound. ill be watching it a few more times thats for sure. only thing was when i watched it in 2d. the picture in some parts where very grainy,i never had that problem before with a new bluray movie. i even played with my settings and had no luck, but other then alittle grainyness. this movie is deff. a keeper
B004XANKVO|5.0|I bought this backpack mainly for air travel.  I have used it only once on a trip out of the country and believe me, it really does the job.  Sturdy and light weight, it fits easily under the seat on a plane.  The compartments are logical and practical.  I do not travel without my laptop so I need a pack that will provide protection.  This pack has it.  i also love the hard-shell case for carrying sunglasses or a cell phone that totally prevents scratches.  Lots of pockets that are convenient such as the water bottle holder and the open pocket for newspapers or magazines.  This backpack is so well made, I doubt that I will ever have to buy another.<br /><br /> I look forward to other items from Thule to compliment my pack.  A little pricey but certainly well worth the trip.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie was Awesome!! I even shed a couple tears, what a good story with great acting! This is not just a Mans..Mans movie, women will also enjoy it
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Love the little twist with Percy and Jason and the way you used all the gods love it do well
B008JGSM6G|5.0|what a fun game all ages can play this game. I will make it to all levels soon even if you play an hour a day you can  more than make it through
B001B3MCQK|4.0|I was so smitten with the movie Searching for Sugarman (about Rodriguez), that I purchased the CD.  I love his lyrics and really like his voice. What a shame we didn't get to know him earlier!
0399213015|4.0|My toddler loved having the little edition to bring around with her everywhere since the real version is big and heavy. The pages are all paper, but in the same fashion as the big book.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I always loved PacMan.  The reaction time on my Kindle isn't good enough.  I can't get it to move fast enough or turn when I want it to. Plus can't see through my own finger.  Maybe a stylis would work better.
B00914JWSW|3.0|These are songs that aren't familiar, and don't have what it takes to make you want to listen again and again, in my opinion. I am a big fan of Ms. Streisand's however, and will always enjoy her music.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|I loved this game. As a big Rad Racer fan, this game thoroughly reminded me of spending many hours seeing how far I could get before time ran out. I have no idea if anyone affiliated with the creation of this game worked on the original game, but if not, I would venture to guess that it was at least an inspiration. Not much to the game itself (it is rather short), but it's entertaining.
B000NJMJGG|5.0|I have always loved this movie since I was a kid . Brings back so many memories! This is just a great movie and I already watched it over and over !
B00ARAO1LC|2.0|Could have been a decent movie, but was way to strange and just didn't make a lot of sense. Not worth the rental...
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was a creative idea but if so many of the situations would have been handled in straight forward manners it wouldn'thave been so dark. I read the book because it was chosen by my book club. I prefer more positive reads.
B002LHRM2E|5.0|This book is well written. It introduces new concepts in program management, and follows the format of a novel which makes for easy reading.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong this is a very good game I wish the tiles were a little bigger but other wise this is great.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Suzanne Collins is a gifted writer. The Hunger Games pulled me in, Catching Fire made me want to read on And Mockingjay made the illusion of losing everything that you love and live for so tangible that my mind is reeling. Must all epic book series end with almost all beloved characters dying?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really like Angry Birds it is a fun game to play it can be frustrating but still like it.
B006O6F4O6|4.0|I bought this gift for both of my godsons and my girlfriend's brother they were all within the ages of 4-5 years old 2 out of the 3 boys loved it and the other was tired of it in 5 minutes. He was more of a spiderman fan anyway lol. The package arrived very promptly and in perfect condition.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love Ebay and this keeps me up to date on the items I am watching and bidding on great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once again John Grisham keeps the reader totally rivited to this book.  You will NOT be disappointed!  I highly recommend this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun and simple game of solitaire I like all kinds of solitaire games and this is a good one.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|This beyblade is awesome. It is the longest spinning beyblade that we have. It sometimes even beats Hell Kerbecs. My son loves it and uses it a lot. It came exactly as the seller stated and was a real Takara Tomy in the Japanese packaging
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this it is a very good weather app it gives you all the info you need to plan your day.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|First book I bought for my Ipad and I really enjoyed not having to carry a book around.<br />It is very convenient
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a friend in the Czech Republic.  For some reason, you would not ship to her country so I got it for her and she liked it very much.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Well, as promised Phillip Phillips debute release did not disappoint. Usually you hear a blip from the TV Produced stars - and then - they gone! However he had quite a following, and after some well deserved rest and retreat, The World From The Side of The Moon was born. \\"Moon\\" started at No. 4 on the main album chart, selling 169,000 copies (according to Interscope Records), then went on to debute at No. 1 on the Top Rock - this would technically make Phillips the first Idol winner ever to top that chart. It currently sits at No. 7 on the Billboard 200, still holding strong at No. 1 on Rock Albums. Currently, \\"Home\\" is listed as No. 15 on Itunes Best of 2012.    It is a really well rounded cd, a far cry from his comparison with Dave Matthews - he blends Indie and Southern Rock with a gentle spirit. My personal favorite is written by Phillips, track 1 on the cd - Man on The Moon. It's a great way to lead you into the album, and take you on the journey of the songs. On the cd he wrote all but three of the songs (which the others he apparently....    Remainder of review located at:  [...]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|new york city for amazon best game ever play subway surfers all the time its so fun my name is seth
B00A72989U|5.0|Opening her fifth album, Girl on Fire, with yet another remarkable piano piece - De Novo Adagio, the anew truly does make you feel at ease and take you on a heartfelt trip through unpredictable emotions.    Currently sitting on Billboard's Hot 100 at 14 and No. 3 on the R&B/Hip-hop chart, Girl on Fire, Inferno Version with Nicki Minaj takes me back to old school hip-hop. Minaji opens it up with a rap about Marilyn Monroe, and Keys comes in commanding - creating an anthem for women to understand they can do all and be all they want to be - a dreamer, a creator, a lover.....

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is one of the best book by Nicholas Sparks.I can't wait to see the movie in February I'm obsessed with Nicholas Sparks
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good book, easy read , liked very much recommend to read give it a five star rating must read liked
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is one of the many Gameloft games that I have downloaded. Like the others it fails to disappoint. Keep it up Gameloft.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|We have viewed the first two episodes and so far the story is interesting though we are not happy with some of the language gratuitious sexual scenes
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Fantastic book I loved it the boys were great and the pictures were also great. One of the things I wish it had was more on what was happening now in their life
B004132HZS|5.0|This show is one of my all time favorites. It is beyond spectacularly written and directed and acted. Long after the credits roll, it will stick with you. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman will win you over -- by the last episode, you'll realize that you are hooked for good... I dare you not to get the second season.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2Y3AB6SMP84LP]]UPDATE: I've used this case for just over 3 years now and it is holding up perfectly. I really like this case since it is minimalistic and has proven to be very durable. It is just as good today in every way as it was 3 years ago when I first acquired it.<br /><br />---<br /><br />This is a very nicely made case for your DSLR. I'm completely happy with the quality of construction and padded protection this provides my Nikon D300. It's the perfect size when I want to grab my DSLR and not be burdened with extra lenses and all the other stuff that I normally would have with me using a larger camera bag.<br /><br />The depth of the case is 7.5&#34; enabling me to fit my D300, and attached battery pack with my 17-55 f2.8 lens. It's a tad tight closing the top zippered lid, but it does fit and that's very nice. If I were to remove the battery pack, it would fit very comfortably with a little wiggle room.<br /><br />The case has an extremely durable bottom piece that is about 1 inch tall and is a solid plastic base. This cushions and protects the DSLR case from water infiltration if you were to set your case on the ground.<br /><br />There are 3 outside pockets. The left and right zippered pockets are marginally useful. They do not expand at all and have little volume but are suitable for lens cleaning cloths, lens filters or something thin. The front pocket is way more useful and has enough room to put in several smaller items. It has a elasticized back nylon mesh panel that you could throw a couple memory cards into as well as two dedicated memory card (SD) pockets with velcro closure on the front inside panel.<br /><br />A comfortably padded and suitably wide shoulder strap is included.<br /><br />What a great case this is. Very functional, comfortable to carry and just the right amount of space to easily carry a DSLR, decent sized lens plus a few odds and ends.<br /><br />It's a great price and seems to be of the highest quality. I expect this will provide years of good service.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that will hold more gear but is still very easy to carry check out the [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories-Black]] that I have reviewed here http://www.amazon.com/review/R168VTS3JFPB86s will provide years of good service.<br /><br />If you're looking for something that will hold more gear but is still very easy to carry check out the [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras and Accessories-Black]] that I have reviewed here http://www.amazon.com/review/R168VTS3JFPB86
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is a big fan. This played throughout the season in our house.
B0083H6AQA|3.0|Tale tells of Georges Duroy (Robert Pattinson), an ex veteran, who comes from a life of poverty and wants to make something of himself in late 19th century Paris. He starts by meeting  an old army acquaintance who is higher in social standing than him and opens him up to high society. As he's young and good looking women take an interest in him, even married ones. Georges uses his male charms to manipulate women to the top and might even find a bit of real love along the way.<br /><br />The tale is predictable underneath the spectacle of the era. That said, it's impressive per the cast lined up: Uma Thurman, Kristin Scott Thomas and Christina Ricci.<br /><br />Based on an 1885 novel of the same name by French author Guy de Maupassant. There have been several movie adaptions.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was roughly $9M but it made a tad over $8.3M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C plus to B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; ROMANCE/LOVE STORIES: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early January 2013 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B minus.
B000BT97AO|5.0|Ordered this for my son and maybe a little more for me...we are serious Neil Gaiman fans...love all his work!
0765325950|1.0|This is 2013, not the Age of Legends. The lack of a Kindle edition -- even an ebook of any kind is unacceptable.<br /><br />It's particularly unacceptable given that I have been a loyal fan of this series for seventeen years, and I would dearly like to read this book.<br /><br />I don't know who is responsible for this decision, but it strikes me as shortsighted -- I would be happy to pay the same price as the hardbook for the Kindle edition, were it available on day one. Instead, everyone involved is unhappy. The publisher doesn't get my money, the author doesn't get my money, the estate of Robert Jordan doesn't get his money, and I'll just wait for it to come out at the local library or borrow it from someone else.<br /><br />Really not a great customer experience.
034580404X|5.0|Shipped promptly...just as said. Was sent as a gift to the inmates of Vigo County Jail because it was requested and they are seriously lacking in their literature selections since they have done away with the library program.
B004I744AS|5.0|the program is very intuitive and user friendly. It has options for either translation or thesaurus. Very good product.<br />Navigation is agile
0380789019|5.0|Item just as described...excellent price. Fast easy  shipment arrived right on time. Recommend to a friend. Would definitely do business with again. Thanks.
B00005AXKF|1.0|Knowing this was being sent to USA it would have been good for the sellar to share that the DVD would not work in a DVD player in the USA due to country restrictions. I am not able to use it and it was a full waste of money. The ad was written in English and I had no idea the DVD was produced in Germany.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft at their best. A charming afternoon's movie entertainment. Shows the power of  the written word.
B00A5IYCYM|5.0|Absolute classic!  If you enjoyed the Magnificent Seven with Brynner,McQueen,et al. ( and who didn't ) you will love viewing the original movie on which Mag7 was based.  The High Def cleanup of the original print makes it even more enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was drawn in during the first chapter &  couldn't put it down! While the plot is frustrating to a degree it is very well written & you can't help but root for the characters. I can't wait to read book #2.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is great. I could not put it down. Everyone should read this book, it is absolutely fabulous and wonderful.
B008OTTSX4|2.0|very dissapointing and not recommended; it's not recorded very well and it's nothing like the original machine head like they wanted you to think it is.
030758836X|4.0|I was definitely into this book, its worth reading.  I was really dissapointed with the ending, it could have been so much better.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|My daughter was very happy to get her ONE DIRECTION album and this was one of the few places with a copy in stock.
B009X01C64|5.0|I really like that this case  rotates/revolves from landscape to portrait orientation. The auto wake up feature is nice too when you open the cover!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show is much bigger than any television show I've ever seen. I'm amazed at the production of the show. The stories are well written and make you long for the next episode. I couldn't imagine waiting week to week to watch it.
B009EE4YWI|5.0|Thought it was a great movie for 8+ year old kids...I enjoyed it also as an adult.  I would definitely watch it again with my son
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is just extremely well done. You get caught up into the Downton Abbey world and you don't want to leave.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I downloaded this not realizing how many songs I used to love..Thank you so much for helping me remember. Wow!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this classic as a girl, but enjoyed it just as much as an adult.  Great writing and a lovely story.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This is a great album.  This album brought back great memories. Cheerful, well-crafted tunes a la old Steely Dan at their best with awesome lyrics. If you are or were a Steely Dan fan , you should snatch this without hesitation.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Best. Movie. Ever.  I love the historical information and the twists in this movie, it kept me interested for the entire film, LOVE IT and I'm so glad I was able to find it after years of looking.  It's mine now!
B008QLXSG8|2.0|What is the big deal?  I read this book because a college age acquaintance had mentioned it was on a required reading list for one of his classes.  In researching the book I found it is high on the list of existential writings.  I got nothing out of it other than perhaps how empty existentialism is.  No wonder students drop out of college and feel they are wasting their money.  America is producing some fabulous literature yet there is an old guard that clings to all that is bleak in life.  May I recommend Victor Frankle’s Man’s Search for Meaning?  This is a much better and true account of the human spirit and what it can accomplish.  If you have to read this to in class to placate the instructor do so but do not hesitate to counter with truth, hope and optimism and do not accept this as real life.
1580176941|5.0|I was very pleased with this book. I learned everything about piping and flooding and countless ideas about decorating and shipping your cookies. Loaded with great pictures of cookies for every season, occasion and holiday, there are ideas galore. It truly will inspire you and spark your creativity!! Thanks!
078322804X|5.0|I just love this movie. I'll sometimes show it as a treat to my middle school students, just to illustrate some fun examples of great blues-rock legends acting and/or performing music. The Ray Charles scene in the music store is priceless...
B008XG1X18|4.0|I think the kindle pinterest app is great. It feels very easy to use, and things have gone well so far!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|There is lots of insight to be gained from watching this. First, you have the monumental task of putting together a high-tech multi-media event like a MJ concert. Then, of course, you have Michael himself. I feel as if watching him interact with individuals in a rehearsal situation can help one come closer to understanding this often mis-understood and enigmatic person.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't like that I can't do all the things that I'm able to do from the PC. For instance, when I have a message sent to my business page, I couldn't read it. Very odd.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I use parts of this film as a teaching tool in my classes to help illustrate the important story of the spawning of American electric rock 'n' roll, largely out the acoustic Mississippi blues. Some of the details in the movie are absolutely fiction, but the major points are basically accurate.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't wait for some more...keep it up EL James. Love it!!!  Very interested to read some more about Ana & Christian.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|good movies love the actors. Keeps you on your seat and how good the actors are, Very well done by the actors
1419705849|5.0|Great book that reads just as easy and is just as fun as all the other books in the series.  My son and I have enjoyed every one of these books and he looks forward to getting the next one every Christmas.
0783230079|5.0|Very touching movie. Heart and Souls is a good family movie. would recommed this to everyone. It is a keeper.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|Loved it.  This book came in at the perfect time for me.  Common sense approach to starting and running a business.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Missed most of the first season so had to buy it as well for a friend. Love the characotrs very well done
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I got this game and while I am playing it a pop up adds start coming on my screen while I am trying to play. and when I try to get rid of them it woad that I had to buy another coarse on the game. other than that this game is ok.
0307891402|5.0|Its basically the Textbook of Skyrim. Its worth every penny. The hard cover is durable and the pages are nice quality and the overall organization of the book is pretty great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I  A C A I R R L I I H<br />T  O P  E E I T T E<br />S  O P  L L K  S L<br />  L  L L E  P<br />  Y Y  F<br />  U<br />  L
067144901X|5.0|I love Sandra Boynton's books.  Pictures are bright and colorful and the children love being read to.  Will purchase more from this author in the future.
B00000IZOR|5.0|My grandson hasn't quite figured it out yet since all he see's are cell phones.  But he still plays with it.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|I never watched it when it was out, but now that I have seen the first season I can see why it lasted 9 seasons I can't wait to watch them all..
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This may be my first and only review, but this movie was completely entertaining.  If you are a fan of comic book movies but want to watch something closer to the original comic watch this film.
B0034G4P80|1.0|I give this no stars! I finally got around to watching this movie and when I took it out of the packaging there wasn't even a DVD inside it! Is this how Amazon is handling it's purchases with long standing and loyal customers?! Unbelievable!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wanted to read before the movie.<br />Slow start, tedious meandering of author's thoughts. In the end, most of the foundational ramblings were relevant. The story really began around chapter 28 (of about 90 chapters). I did not want to put it down!
B0063IH60K|4.0|plays great, but like everything else on my kindle fire that shuts off when i quit using it, this stays on when you lay it down.  the battery goes fast when you do!
B001I45UFC|5.0|My family wanted to have a ebook version to read on the Kindle, so though we already own this fabulous series, we now have this to read electronically and conveniently. C.S. Lewis is insightful and weaves a wonderful story.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|very heartwarming.  however, i am not finished yet.  the four stars may go up to ten by time i'm done!!!
B009IKUFDU|5.0|After such an amazing debut album it would have been easy to do Baby Darling Doll Face Honey partII. Instead, in Sweet Sour we witness the brilliant evolution of an amazing band.  This is what rock 'n' roll was meant to be.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I fell in love with this story. Once you read this book you can't help but want to start the next one right after, which is what I did. I personally think this is the best one out of all three.
B009MF56GC|5.0|It's a good movie.  New in package.  Not much else to say about it other than its a good movie.
B00973DDN2|5.0|Better & better! They keep the original sound but make it sound new everytime!!!<br />This is just as good as Sam's Town I think!
B007FJFDXS|4.0|Interesting concept and fun game.  It takes all the fun of Q-bert and subtracts the springs and furry things, and... okay... its almost nothing like Q-bert, but its a fun game and if you like being a sentient cube, then THIS is the game for you.
0553062182|5.0|I read this book at aged 38 and finally understood and accepted myself.  It basically gave me permission to be me and embrace my sensitivity and respect and enjoy it.  I'm indebted to the the Author.
0374275637|5.0|This was a gift, but the idea has bounced around in my head for a long time.  With all this pressure put on thinking fast, but juxtaposed with the idea we need time to think through something, undoubtedly, some cognitive function is lost.  Knowing when something needs more than a fleeting thought paid to it rather than little more than a few seconds to process is key to successful living.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I started to read this book as a teenager, but never finished it.  I picked it up again a few weeks ago and now I look forward to bedtime each night so I can continue the story!  The history and social quandries of that time are still relevant today.  Each character is so vivid that I have empathy for all of them.  I'm thrilled to have rediscovered this wonderful book!
B0087HT36U|4.0|essentially an angry birds clone, but with a pirate theme and different approach.  Fun to kill some time, but glad it happened to be free.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|I have always wanted to see if this is really in sync with the movie, the Wizard of Oz. Pink Floyd is great, but when combined with this classic movie, it is even better. Start the CD when the movie begins at the MGM's Lion's third roar. Turn down the movie sound and enjoy a really cool experience.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie is what people who are fans of the Alien series have been waiting for since they first laid eyes on that shiny black killing machine in the first film.  Extraordinary visuals and engaging storyline... All good all around.
1451695195|4.0|I think the most interesting part of this book is that Eben Alexander knows the &#34;doubting Thomas&#34; found in most doctors concerning the life beyond the physical realm as he was one himself but in spite of that he firmly believes and represents what he experienced. He also reminds the reader that we are here to learn and become more advanced in our understanding of<br />knowledge and love and finally realize we are all not separate but one.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Free of charge and very fast downloading, the best option to read a classic on my tablet.<br />Thanks a lot!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Pitch Perfect is honestly one of my favorite films. I never would have imagined that I would fall in love with a movie like this! It's like Glee but instead of wanting to punch myself in the face, I find myself enjoying it! Recommend this movie to anybody who loves musicals or comedies.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows. The dvd's came well packaged and arrived fairly quickly. I would recommend this to others!
1400069289|5.0|It was the book my husband wanted so he was pleased with so am I. I really don't know what else to say.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the beginning of season 3.  Positives were Maggies Smith's continued brillliance.  Her character is so well portrayed by her...it is hard to remember her before Downton!  Shirley Maclaine is fabulous as well! I hope she sticks around Downton for awhile.<br />The negatives were few, except that at times it felt a little slow and I could tell my husband was getting antsy.  But all in all...can't wait until next week!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What a thrill to see again the classic Indiana Jones in this complete set of his adventures.  Excellent collection to have and to enjoy.
B0073QNIH6|5.0|I got these Dinosaurs for my boys for Christmas. They were speechless when they opened their gifts. The quality and craftsmanship is well worth the price. I originally found these at walmart, but the online price was cheaper with free shipping.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|If you like Michael Buble, or any of the classic Buble songs, or if you have never even heard of this guy, then you will enjoy this CD.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|First, I want to get the one negative out of the way. The analog stick feels a bit awkward and uncomfortable to me. I tried to get used to it, but I wound up just using the main pad for movement. Which isn't really a big deal, since I can still use the stick for other key binds. So, despite that one downside, the G13 works beautifully. As an added bonus, since I'm using it with a laptop it adds a lot of comfort value. Very happy with my purchase.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Classic soundtrack from the movie, great songs and just very inspiring.  Now need to go see Broadway production too and enjoy that.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Everything that we expected. Rods gravely voice makes his music special. Great album with old standbys sung by a master.
B0068RHSZO|5.0|Danie Craig has a good performance in this movie, full of twists and turns and surprises and good entertaining stuff.  Plus he meets his future wife on set, so even better!
B004BJMEO6|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie but was somewhat disappointed.  There is heat between the two characters, but the sub-par production values was distracting, an all too familiar quality with most lesbian love story movies.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Those who have not seen the movie, need a little nudge and so that is where a great soundtrack discreetly purchased helps out!
B002ELIXCA|1.0|I was so anxious to see this original series but it won't work on my Kindle 8.9  It runs for a few seconds and then pauses like forever.  few more seconds of film, pauses again.  Can't watch it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|An OK read...Not the kind of story I needed to read through and not put down. It was a bit hard to embrace any of the characters.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love jetpack joyride!  It very entertaining and quite addicting.  Best free game I have downloaded on the kindle fire!  Cannot stop playing!!
B009H442DG|5.0|We really enjoyed this Christmas CD. We gave one to another family too and they enjoyed it also! We would recommend it!
B00553U3HM|4.0|Good plot and not excessive number of characters to keep track of.  I purchased more titles by Follett and have also enjoyed them.
0062101897|5.0|The book is LOADED with tons of pictures and information that I just haven't seen anywhere else.  I'm sure a lot of it is out there but I like that I have it all in one place.  Concerned for the fold outs of some of the larger photos but as a huge Potter fan, it's an amazing addition to my collection.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great game for kids. And for the nerds in the family. We fight over the tablet now like never before
0547258305|5.0|You can find this review and many others on my blog The Dancing Nerd Writes Again.<br /><br />Initial Thoughts:<br /><br />I had heard so many good things about this book, along with the ever present one or two negative reviews, and realized I was far behind the young adult genre world in discovering Graceling. I finally decided to get this book off my TBR list and I'm so glad I did. I wasn't really sure what this book would be about but I was excited to learn more about Katsa's `Grace' and her relationship with the seemingly mysterious Prince Po.<br /><br />Spoilers!<br /><br />I finished this book late last night and I'm still reeling over the ending, but more on that later. I would like people who haven't yet read this book to know that the next two books in the series (Fire and Bitterblue) do not follow the story of Katsa and Po (or at least that's my understanding). While reading Graceling I was so sure that this was just the beginning of Katsa and Po's journey that I think I took it for granted  It was a huge blow finding out that this was their one and only story (for now at least).<br /><br />Sad part over, now onto the review.<br /><br />From the first chapter, I loved it! Simple as that. I was immediately swept up into this world of adventure, hate, power, greed, lust, and magic, but not in the usual sense. In so many ways it reminded me of Christopher Paolini's  Eragon series. The feel of the characters, the pace of the novel, and of course the action had me turning pages faster than I even thought possible.<br /><br />I forgot how much I truly missed this genre of young adult fiction and need to go back to it immediately. I've been so swept up in the dystopian, love triangle, whatever else trend that's happening in YA that I've been missing my true love of fantasy fiction. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the other genres as well, but fantasy fiction is such easy reading for me while some other books feel like work.<br /><br />Not only do I consider this booka gem, but Katsa is a true gem herself. She may be controlled by her uncle, who happens to be the King, but she was never weak. She could hold her own, and her true discovery is learning that she has a choice in her actions. Po is the one who helps her to see this and he essentially turns Katsa into the person she was always meant to be.<br /><br />I so enjoyed the way Po was described with his eyes and accessories. Actually, I loved the way everything was described. I can't remember the last time I had such vivid images swirling around my head while reading a book. I could picture Lienid, I could picture Katsa sitting up in the mast of the ship, I could picture the mountain pass, and every description became a clear image in my mind.<br /><br />I love the idea of having a Grace. It was similar to the special abilities of the outsiders in Under The Never Sky (by Veronica Rossi), but what I loved even more were the relationships in the novel. Katsa and Po's relationship grew in a genuine way and their love for one another was undeniable. The sacrifices they made for each other clearly showed the depth of their relationship just as much if not more than the occasional make out scene. However, I think my favorite relationship was between Katsa and Bitterblue, Po's cousin.<br /><br />Many people seem to disagree or dislike the fact that Katsa refuses to marry. I bring this up only because I want to argue a point. Okay, maybe you personally don't agree with a woman not wanting to marry, but Katsa is a girl who has been controlled by a man (the King) her entire life. All she wants is the freedom to do what she chooses when she chooses and to not be stuck in her husband's house serving his guests. I totally get this concept and I think Kristin Cashore did a great justice by showing that side to her character especially given the world this story is set in. Bravo.<br /><br />But the ending. That was a hard one to swallow. Don't get all freaked out yet, nothing bad happens,it just made me a little sad. For one reason or another certain characters `part ways' in hopes that they will return to each other again. This wouldn't have been so hard to comprehend if there was going to be a follow up novel! Instead, I'll have to use my imagination and unite the characters together, happily ever after, myself.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />If you couldn't tell from this extremely long review, I've discovered yet another book I'm obsessed with. I'm nervous to read Fire and Bitterblue knowing that they won't be as interrelated as I would've liked, but come on, Kristin Cashore's writing has me coming back for more, without question.<br /><br />I am so glad I picked this novel from my TBR list. I think it was the perfect timing, a vacation from the overwhelming majority of dystopian novels I've been consumed with. Graceling has reminded me that I need to get back to my reader roots. My true comfort zone when it comes to any genre is fantasy or adventure, I just eat it up.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has read Christopher Paolini's work or Veronica Rossi's books or anyone who is missing a little fantasy and adventure in their life. You definitely won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5 Stars
0765325950|5.0|This is simply to offset all of the negative reviews from those who are upset from the lack of Ebook. One thing to remember is that it was Jordan's wife who requested the delayed release of the ebook not TOR(please see Sanderson's blog). However, this will likely hurt sales as there are already pirate ebook versions available.
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|I am giving it a bad review because it will not run on my daughter's tablet.  :(  She was very disappointed.
B005SDB6RK|5.0|One of the most incredible, breath-taking films I have ever seen! Such an excellent purchase - it left me speechless!
B007C94QRK|5.0|This is a must play when my two year old niece is around. Great movie and great songs. To not hear of the movie until after it was released is very sad. Great movie and classic along the way. Highly recommend this to any all ages.

1451696191|3.0|I saw the movie and thought \\"I love this movie. I must read the book.\\" I got the book and read it in about 7 - 8 hours. For me, that is quick. I like it when writers write clear enough that I don't need several days/weeks to finish a book. I like even more when writers can put me into the story, giving me all the tools I need to imagine the characters (even though in this instance I had help from the movie).  I got excited for the protagonist, Charlie, when I was supposed to, and everything is going well, until the last 2 or 3 chapters of the book.<br /><br />I liked the movie because it gave useful hints explaining Charlie's awkwardness and enough flashbacks through out the entire movie to let me know there was something else going on, even though  I wasn't sure of it yet. In the book, however, Charlie is just this normal shy kid drudging along with these friends that he initially makes out to be uncool. Then you find out that they are super cool and are only offbeat in an ironic way, which then makes you wonder why on earth they'd be friends with Charlie. However, I got past all that, because I'm an optimist and like to imagine that cool kids would befriend the lonely kid. But the last bit although extremely important to understanding Charlie, comes out of nowhere  and is only discussed in a few pages in the last chapter of the book, then brushed over like \\"Now all is well, and Charlie is no longer shy and awkward\\". It really surprised me that it was handled so poorly in the book because in the movie Charlie had given away enough through his narrative that I had an idea something was being held back.<br /><br />The ending, the way it was handled, just made the book so corny to me, that the best I could give it is 3 stars. And 2 of the stars is because I really enjoyed the movie.

B0091VTNZC|5.0|I'm not sure what more I can say about this film than ROTFL! I love this movie and plan to watch it again and again, year after year! It's hilarious and has some great one-liners too! If you've never seen it yet, you're missing out!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I want more of it! It is awesome! The Castle is perfect, and all the costumes and scenics were wonderful. The plot is addictive. The actors were perfect.  All in all five stars-looking forward to season three.
0446554995|5.0|I could not put the book down..there were so many unexpected twists and turns.!  I can't wait for the next Pendergast novel!
0783225849|2.0|The DVD available from NetFlix is a colorized version . . . although it is billed as \\"the 1960 classic\\" which, if you're a purest,  is tantamount to colorizing CASABLANCA.  Don't see any indication from Amazon that the version(s) they have are black and white or color.  I find it difficult to believe that in his lifetime Hitchcock ever okayed that happening.  If Ted Turner bought the rights and then colorized it, that is/was his prerogative; but to rent it, as NetFlix does, or sell it, as Amazon is doing, and call it the 1960 Classic is a misrepresentation IMHO.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Truly AMAZING.<br />I've never read a book that could literally make me \\"lol\\" and have my stomach in knots/butterflies, to make me truly cry all at once. The story of Sky and Dean is one of its own, it shows all aspects of emotions; confused, angry, happy, sad, nervous, excited, most of all LOVED. Though Colleen never really mentions it I believe it was also FATE. This book is definitely a must read/have! A story I will NEVER forget.<br /><br />IT DESERVES TO BE TURNED INTO A MOVIE! hint, hint :)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Best game ever. It takes practice, but once you get it down you become very involved. Definitely worth it .GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00APUQPX6|5.0|My daughter loved this. I have to say even I really liked it. She is 6 and thought it was funny as anything.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|This game came up as a black screen and then completely froze my Kindle. I couldn't get back to the home page or even shut it down normally. I had to hold the power button down for a long time until it re-booted and finally started up again. Deleting.

B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good flick.  Would like to see more of the &#34;new&#34; Bourne Legacy..He really has a tough act to follow, but I am sure he will come through.  He sure was tough in this flick.  I really would like to see more action movies similar to this in the near future.  Go rent, borrow, buy or whatever this movie.  It is worth your time.
0375851569|4.0|I remember reading several of the Dr. Seuss series of books as a child and I remember the subtle messages of gentle tolerance expressed in the rhymes and cartoons of these books.  I do not know of any better first book for a child.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I put off buying this for so long. I like to buy my dvd's in combo packs with Blu-ray and digital. I do not like Ultra Violet. I was upset to see that not only did this movie NOT come in a combo pack, but the only way to own a digital copy was through Ultra Violet. After a while I decided I should just buy it and bear with Ultra violet since I already had been forced once to do Ultra Violet. So I bought it, and opened it up to register my Ultra Violet copy and found a happy surprise!<br /><br />The code given for the digital copy said it would also work for iTunes. So I followed the instructions for an iTunes copy, and now I have it the way I prefer to have it! And I can watch it anywhere I want on my iPod WITHOUT the need for wifi.<br /><br />Love the movie, I think it is a perfect movie adaption, and I am excited to see Catching Fire. The Director was smart in asking Susan Collins to help him. I love the Capitol, and each actor portrays their character so well.
B000AM2L1O|3.0|I was given several suggestions as to what to purchase for my niece and, among the many choices, I chose this toy.<br /><br />I have no other opinions regarding this item.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I found this book to be entertaining and a great escape for winter reading.  It is a classic love story, with a twist, bringing the world of witches and vampires to an adult novel.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book from the start. This has been added to my &#34;favorites&#34; in my kindle and is one that i will read over and over and over and never get tired of reading it!! READ IT!

B00008L3U1|4.0|I thought this movie was great. Robin Williams, Diane Lane, Bill Crosby, Fran Drescher and the kids in this movie were great and the story was wonderful and cute. I would recommend this movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|That season 3, at least the first half, has been my favorite so far. No slow episodes in the bunch, although the one that didn't have the main group in it could have been better. I'm dying now waiting for the series to return in February!!!

B003AJSRVW|3.0|Im not going to get really in depth with this review, as there is enough literature available via the internet to fill you in on any details i dont touch upon, but ill start by saying that Ghost in the Shell is very unique, and beautifully animated. It opens strong, but suffers from pacing issues throughout the rest of the film that left me yawning at times.<br /><br />The story is needlessly complex, by the end of the film i just about had it figured out, but if you go into this without any prior knowledge of Ghost in the Shell lore, you will be struggling to keep up throughout most of the film. The movie in general is just a form of media used to communicate some very interesting and thought-provoking philosophical questions regarding artificial intelligence, how we define humanity, and what sentience truly means. However, the gist of this could have been wrapped up in a 5 minute monologue without all the complicated stuff that makes up the bulk of the story.  Speaking of the story and pacing, one of my biggest gripes was the underwhelming, anti-climactic conclusion (if you can call it a conclusion) that left me wondering &#34;thats all?&#34;<br /><br />Overall this was a good flick, and i understand its great influence on other films and art, but do not expect to be blown away and entertained like Akira makes you feel. I suppose in 1995 the exploration of sentience, AI and humanity may have been more ground-breaking, but if you are someone seeing this for the first time in 2013, you will have seen all this stuff explored in great detail via other films and forms of media such as video games.
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are great but a little delicate wiring into the ear-piece.  Thus I double over the wire and wrap tape around the doubled over wire where it goes into the ear piece.  I use black electrical tape.  That way they last longer.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|great product. great quality. exactly what told in the specification.<br />wrapping and packaging was great.<br />180 grams vinyls are with excellent quality
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I had heard from multiple friends that I should read this book, but I wasn't very excited about it.  Even reading the Kindle sample, I kind of lost interest.  DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE.  This book is one of the best I have ever read and I am enjoying the next book in the series as well.<br /><br />Additionally, my wife, who has not traditionally enjoyed this type of book, she is more hooked on the series than I am!  You can't go wrong buying and reading this book!
B0099Y20VK|5.0|I love this movie. I own it, but bought it again just so I wouldn't have to put it in the dvd player. That would make it a love!

B00A9X9VAI|1.0|i wish i could loop back in-time and not watch it, go firefly hunting, or feed some stray cats. this movie was retarded... i skipped through most of it which may or may not make this review, a review, but:<br />the whole \\"life runs in a circle\\" thing as drawn at the very end of the movie was a nice concept but with the plot and story board of this movie... lame. the hinting of \\"the ends justifies the means\\" with killing the children, added to the fact that the one who supposedly cherished life and love was the one who was carrying out this horrendous escapade, was even more fuel to my fire of how... retarded this movie was. i watched the preview again after i watched it... i dont see a connection? someone please help me on that one..?..!
B0042MDAL8|5.0|I love these movies, I especially like the love triangle, the plot is ok, and so are the actors, pretty good stuff.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|For years I read everything that Stephen King published, but after awhile I just couldn't keep up. After taking a long break, I had heard that 11/22/63 was excellent, and a very different book than what his fans were used to. I was interested in this time period (58-63) along with the Kennedy assassination and decided to give it a try. One of the best things about this book was that King was so descriptive that I actually felt like I was living in the late 50's and early 60's. I was enjoying regular day-to-day details about that unique period along with the gripping story of a high school teacher named Jake Epping who is asked to go back in time to stop Lee Harvey Oswald. I didn't mind that the way he got there was simple (Hey look! The back of this room takes me back in time!).You will really get into the challenges of establishing a new life in the past, spying on a famous assassin, and attempting to maintain a romantic relationship with someone you can't stay with while hiding secrets. This is not a friendly version of &#34;Back to the Future.&#34; Some of the decisions Jake has to make are absolutely gut-wrenching, and King will make the reader go through many different emotions from start to finish. Another important concept is that you assume that Oswald is the &#34;monster&#34; in the book. Obviously he is a central villain, but is also portrayed as weak, impressionable, and a father who loves his children. I found the real monster to be a different character that I don't want to give away, and time itself. The past does NOT like to be messed with, and Jake figures out that it's much more difficult to deal with fighting these unseen forces than most people he will encounter. I also enjoyed a brief encounter with some of the gang from &#34;It&#34;. I think this is one of the best books I've read in years, and an amazing piece of writing.

1451695195|2.0|Read Dr. Alexander's book - and with all due respect to him and his story - as a RN and former EMT who has spoken to many folks that have technically been declared dead for a short time, coded, and had NDE's - their reports of God, Heaven, seeing their past relatives and friends that have passed, etc. are very different than Dr. Alexander's story. I'm in no position to say it's NOT true - but perhaps being in a coma doesn't necessarily mean he was truly 'on the other side' per se? I dunno - his report of the 'other side' has no common generalities that I have hear from others' stories that WERE technically pronounced dead and have reported to have seen God Himself, Angel's, friends and relatives and also describe what Heaven itself really looks like, what inhabitant's there look like, do, etc. Very different story that Dr. Alexander's. Wasn't what I respected at all nor what I have been told or feel that heaven is like at all per se. Again - not saying he is lying or his story in not accurate - just not the 'norm' from what I hear from many other NDE's patients. read it and perhaps decide for yourself.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I loved the game Cut the Rope and this one is just as good!  I reccommend it it to all!
0439023513|3.0|Yep, that's what I said, it's like the author was going really well only to FLOP in the end.  The third book Stunk!  And on top of that it ruined the whole story.  Talk about fizzling out!
B008OJ291W|4.0|I wasn't an ELO fan in the 70's. I thought they sounded too polished and lifeless. The music seemed over produced. But the songs themselves were great. This new album was done right. The production level is just right. These great songs now have the edge that they lacked in the 70's. Check out Showdown and Do Ya. They rock like hell.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Finally, the story gets the fast pace it deserves! It was still very descriptive of almost everything but i did not find myself bored as i was sometimes in the first book.
B00008G7UF|4.0|Keven Kline does a fabulous job.  He's almost more believable as a Frenchman than Jean Reno! Watch this one with someone you love.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|This show came out while my wife and I were expecting, so I probably enjoyed it a little more than I would have otherwise. It has some laugh-out-loud moments that I remember even a few months after watching it, which is generally an indication of a movie worth watching. I won't buy it, though.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this product because it allows me the convenience of a little entertainment and &#34;Down time&#34; any time I want and need it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I unexpectedly love this show.  Not usually my type of thing, but for some reason I can't get enough of it.  Great acting, great setting and lots of subdued drama
B004FK24ZA|5.0|This movie is great I love it and I loved the price and in some stores they asked for to much money.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|By applying Don Miguel Ruiz's concepts from this book you can change your life for ever and find an exciting new world as your playground.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I have been looking for a total body workout solution for awhile. I thought my answer would be a rowing machine or something like that. Then I came across 30 Day Shred and for less than 5 bucks and no shipping cost or time at all I was working out with this GREAT program. I'm a stay at home - work at home mom of 2 with a busy husband and don't have time for long work outs. But since I work at home sitting at the computer most days I really needed something with cardio plus strength training. This workout is something I can fit into a 1/2 hour (including a shower!) and it kicks my butt! If you do this daily or even every other day, you will see results. I'm so happy I found this- Saved me hundreds on expensive equipment.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|this little ap will let you see graphically whether or not you have a good connection to available networks so that you can see if it will produce results using your tablet.  Simple and effective.
0765325950|5.0|After several chapters the battle begins and it never lets up. One feels the utter exhaustion of the characters as the book continues the frenetic pace. I am surprised anyone made it out alive. A must read for any fantasy fan.
B0011ZYIZQ|5.0|I loved it when it first came out and I still love it now. Still her best album. Gave me chills than and still does now.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Wonderful show...lots of interesting ideas and things to see. It's fun going back and watching it a second time too!
0694003611|4.0|great book! I'm sure he'll chew the edges, very &#34;baby friendly&#34;.... its has nice thick pages and is very colorful!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Although I picked  up on the twist early on, I believe many won't until the end, and will love it. If it doesn't make you a teary-eyed, nothing will ...
0714864803|5.0|I should say first that this is the kind of cookbook you need to read through, then use. First, because it will take the home cook quite a while to decide what to make; and second, if you're not near an ethnic grocer, some ingredients will need to be ordered online. I love the za'atar recipe, and I'm looking forward to the winter storm warning this weekend to try some of the bread recipes!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Good book and quick read. A little simple at times but a fun ride. I can't wait for the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down. I read constantly and I finally finished! I Will definitely read this again! I loved it!
B008VBYN80|1.0|Not a big fan, I downloaded this and as soon as I opened knew it wasn't what I was expecting.  I removed it from my Kindle almost right away.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|What is your definition of family? What would you do for your family? This thought provoking thriller will cause you to examine those questions and make you consider just how far you would go far a family member. Harry Hole comes home to help a young man he considers his son who is charged in a drug related murder. The relationships between fathers and sons, both actual and figuratively, are examined and challenged. Combine that with a first class thriller and just try not to devour this book in one sitting.
B005LAII12|3.0|Pretty much what you'd expect if you've watched Family Guy, but with more swearing. If you don't like the humor in Family Guy, you won't like this. Some of the jokes are hilarious, and some aren't. Like Family Guy you also get some recycled stuff that you've pretty much seen or heard before. John's fight with Ted was funny but reminiscent of a few of the Stewie vs Brian, Chris vs Meg shticks. Ted's hot blonde checkout girl has the most annoying accent - you can see why the previews didn't feature her talking! John and Ted make all the good jokes. There are lots of other stars and cameos, but I didn't think any of them added anything. 3 stars for a one-time comedy rental. Not really worth more than one viewing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it! Could not put it down, i was even reading it on my phone at work!I am so excited for the movie now!
B007EE4XKI|2.0|This book was not as interesting as other Star Trak. It was dragging and boring. I would not recommend it.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Even if your not a Beatle fan, you'll love this film. YS will stand the test of time and ranks with Wizard of OZ, Shrek, and A Christmas Story.
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|This is the best app out there!  Had it on my Ipod, then got it for my Kindle Fire HD!<br />I get such a great night's sleep when i use this, and I stay asleep all night. I would<br />recommend any of Andrew's apps: relaxation, weight-loss or deep sleep. His voice<br />is so calming and hypnotizing!
B00003CXBK|2.0|I loved Howls Moving Castle. Loved Spirited Away. Embraced Kikis Delivery Service, Arriety and the cat film that I cant think of. What happened here?  I dunno just didnt care for it and therefore I wont be recommending it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game, very addictive. It's just a shame you have to wait so long for tickets. Well worth downloading for free though.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Good Movie! I enjoyed watching it with my neighbors on our 60&#34; flat screen TV in blu-Ray. Good Movie to Watch.
0765325950|5.0|This is mainly to counter all the negative reviews, which are being given for the wrong reason, IMO. Just because there is no ebook yet doesn't mean the hardcover is a one star book. You tarnish the legacy of Mr. Jordan with your short-sighted tantrums. If you want to criticize the book based on its content, and not its format, please do. Honest one star reviews based on content are welcome. Your format whining does not belong here, it belongs in an email to the publisher.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|so happy with my purchase, it brought so much joy to my grandson the quality was excellent, I would surely buy more
0783225199|5.0|Thank you - this really surprised my son with this purchase.<br />He loves showing it to his friends who have never seen it before.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I got this book as a joke. Now I can't help but look over my shoulder and wonder if there really are zombies. Max Brooks really did his homework and tied everything together so well. I especially liked the alleged \\"outbreaks\\" he talked about, they were so real. Great book!!
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Great movie, HD, good quality sound, no complaints. I had some issues with my internet so the movie kept buffering quite a bit.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome hey I'm bored let me finish the book please I'm so bored I need to show my mom I'm done
B0088WFZQG|4.0|My Son (12) & I Watched this and it was pretty good.  The quality delivered to my TV was not Clear...but we were able to make it thru the movie.  Probably won't order any more flix this route.  Much clearer thru Netflix.  Wasn't a terrible experience but just not for me.  That being said....the Movie was Action Packed and was enjoyed by my Son & I.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|i think this movie is fabulous! if you liked 'stand by me', you'll like this one too. great story, great ending! full of twists and surprises!  Set back in the 60s, it's a terrific visit to times gone by, but a timeless story.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|GOOD&#62; Recieved within time period&#62; Package in good conditions&#62;&#62; That is all i have to say about this...ok? ok ok
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|like the way it shows your work so if you hit a wrong number up the line you can see it
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|CAUTION: SPOILERS!!! DO NOT READ this If you haven't seen all of season 3!!!<br /><br />First, I truly loved seeing Shirley McClain playing Cora's mother and giving the Dowager Countess some of her own medicine - what fun to watch those two veteran actresses!<br /><br />Fellowes gives us the wedding we wanted in the first episode but as is typical he refuses to give us even a glimpse of the reception let alone Mary & Matthew's honeymoon in the South of France. I'm still trying to figure out if all the scenes in Downton (after two tremendously successful seasons with a  gazillion viewers around the world) are all confined to the estate, the village, and brief visits to London (mostly Lady Rosamond's townhouse) in an effort to keep production costs down or merely to reduce the amount of work for Fellowes and his assistant writers?<br /><br />Keeping scenes and their story lines short and concise for a quick paced and often riveting story has worked so well in previous seasons, however, it seems in season 3 everything goes at whirlwind speed -- we're not given enough time to sink our viewing teeth into the various story lines and plots. The scenes unfold at such warp speed that it tends to make the whole thing feel more two-dimensional.<br /><br />I've only seen some of the scenes of the later episodes so I do not know if Sir Richard (Mary's former fiancee') has just given her a complete 'pardon' for dumping him last season but thus far, I've not seen or heard from that character. But, if so, that would also be a real gaffe in the writing - I don't see that character forgiving of anyone who's crossed him!<br /><br />They did a great job re-acquainting us with Lady Sybil and her beloved (former chauffeur) husband, Tom Branson. But the in-house politics between servants has become a little too predictable and lacking that edge that it gave us in previous seasons.<br /><br />The Earl has become quite the curmudgeon (a bit out of line with his long standing patient and compassionate Lord Grantham) and, why is he so hostile toward Tom (Branson) when he and Lady Sybil arrive for Matthew & Mary's wedding; when we last saw them parting with a truce and a handshake?<br /><br />Throughout the scenes I've viewed, it seems that the writers' have lost their verve or enthusiasm - maybe success does make one 'less hungry?'<br /><br />It WAS fun watching Lady Edith come into her own (they've allowed her to dress fashionable and wear a much more flattering hairstyle) and show more confidence. I ALWAYS thought that Lady Mary was just as mean spirited (if not more so) than Edtih but because they had Edith looking all frumpy she was supposed to take all the flack for a bad attitude when really, Mary should have behaved more gracious to her younger and less fortunate sister.<br /><br />It has also been fun to see the conniving O'Brien and Thomas at odds - poor Thomas is out of his league!<br /><br />In later episodes I found myself quite let down to see poor Lady Sybil killed off (what was Fellowes & company thinking?) She was the ONLY sister to show us how that generation of aristocrats began to usurp centuries of elitism and try to bridge the class gap. And, wasn't she the way hot sister? I just loved her because she was lovely inside and out and so much more compassionate and insightful than Lady Mary or Lady Edith put together! Did the writers/producers hope to replace such a warm and engaging character with someone as shallow and stereotypical as the young Lady Rose? Badly done.<br /><br />Of course it's good to know that some fare better such as Mr. John Bates and his ever faithful young wife, head housemaid and full time lady's maid, Anna (who should be a zombie in reality for trying to hold down at least 3 jobs in a house that size - again, could they not budget another housemaid into the script and given Anna the title of Lady's maid?).<br /><br />The final upset for me is that they kill Matthew off. Granted Stephens wanted to be free to do'other projects' but really, they shoot during the summer/warmer months and it's a short schedule. PLENTY of time for Dan to do movies, stage, etc. there in the U.K.. and here (in U.S.). I think the REAL PROBLEM is that they are still clutching the purse strings as if they were on the shoe string budget of Season 1. When in fact, this should be bringing in a gazillion dollars per season now with so many viewers world wide!<br /><br />I'm sorry, but with Matthew AND Lady Sybil out of the picture, it's just not the same show anymore -- to me, they were two of the most appealing characters in the entire ensemble. Too bad Fellowes and the producers didn't just offer Stephens a million dollars per episode (like they do here in the U.S. when characters become wildly popular -- i.e., cast of Seinfeld and Friends all recieved a million dollars per episode to stay on for more seasons). At least 80% of my enthusiasm AND attachment to this series has vaporized along with Matthew's car wreck at the end of this season.<br /><br />My husband (who typically hates 'period pieces' but got hooked in season 2 with World War I scenario) has also 'thrown in the towel' with the deaths of Matthew and Sybil. While Dame Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess will certainly continue to provide this story with interest - even her perfectly timed quips and comically cutting facial glances will not be able to 'carry' this series alone.<br /><br />Sadly, this once Downton Abbey fanATIC has lost her love for all things Downton and no longer will be clamoring for another season with the school girl crush that I once felt for this once great series.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A fast read, funny, and the perfect distraction. Plenty of sarcasm and some embarrassing photo of a young Ms. Fey and family.
B000I0QL82|3.0|This was not what I expected, but I will watch it sometime in the near future.  I do enjoy black and white movies and Bing Crosby was my favorite actor
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I do not understand some of the whining on this product. I ditto with all of the positives. This case is excellant. This is my first Marware product and it wont be the last. Material is great. Will wear just fine. The biggest complaint that I have read is...can't charge the Kindle with the orientation of the kindle positioned in the case. Give me a break people! Leave the friggin case open while you charge your kindle. (Yes the kindle will go to sleep on its own). Or take the 2 seconds to take your kindle out of the Marware case and charge it. It's not rocket science. Leaving anything less than 5 stars on this product because of petty functionality issues is lame. You paid half of the cost of other products for our Kindle Fire HD. If you are looking for a lower cost alternative to protect your Kindle with a bit of style thrown in this is it.

B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Not Clancy's best but well worth reading.  It does not have the fire of his earlier books but still worth the effort!
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This movie is ONLY for fans of Firefly. This movie is nothing but fan service. But that's not a bad thing by any means. I absolutely love, love, LOVE this movie! Brings a bit of closure to the quick demise of the TV show and gives us an opportunity to see the Serenity flying through the stars again! :) The disc and case was in great condition and it arrived around the same time I was told from Amazon. Overall, a great purchase with no regrets on this end. But again, this is fan service for fans of Firefly. If you didn't like the show (I doubt someone would though.) or if you haven't seen the show, steer clear from this. Otherwise, enjoy!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I have wasted alot of hours on this game, thank's for all the entertainment.  This a good app to have on my fire tablet.

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|We picked this movie as a followup from watching Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. It was cool how they tied each of the movies into this one.
160774273X|5.0|An interesting and informative volume about breads and yeast products.  Not for the beginner-A good read for the serious baker.
B00009NQQO|5.0|My<br />grand-daughter had the pleasure of trying out her new bath toy at our house. Thie little hoop stayed  on the side of the tub, and the balls are the perfect size for my daughter's toddler to try to get the balls into the net. This toy was quickly taken home so my grand-daughter would be able to use it each night.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Take Plum Island.  Great character in John Corey.  Snappy dialogue, great action. The Panther takes that same character, John Corey and puts him in Yemen in search for a terrorist.  Wow, sounds like the makings of a great book, huh?<br /><br />While the dialogue is still snappy, the book as a whole, is a dud. Hardly any action.  Most of the pages tell you what you already know, &#34;John Corey is in Yemen looking for a terrorist.&#34;  Over, and over and over again. WE GET IT!  The characters talk about it for the entire book and very little happens.  You are better off dusting off Plum Island and re-reading it than investing any time or money into this failure.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|I expected Mars, a conjoined twin and more of a clear story line.  This was nothing like the original except for the concept of the double double agent and the names of the characters.<br /><br />I was confused at best about what &#34;topside&#34; was and why it seemed they traveled through the earth's core.
0345803507|5.0|This book series is..under all the kink...a very heartwarming love story. I loved the series!!! can't wait for the movie!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Absolutely poetic in the telling of this amazing story,  A book I could read again and again.  Thought provoking and beautifully told.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I think what I love most about these books is the way the author really helps you &#34;see&#34; what he is talking about. can't wait until the end of the next season of the tv show so i can read the next book!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is a great game...on my phone. My 7 and 4 year old play it all the time so when I found it for my kindle I was so excited. It was not good. It always paused (every single time) while playing so it ended up making you run into things once it finally unpaused. After the 6th time of actually freezing my kindle I decided to uninstall it. I would have to turn my kindle off and restart the whole thing to get it unfroze. It's a great game, but it has too many bugs for the kindle download. Highly recommend for a different device.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If you enjoy Family Guy then you will really like this movie, super funny. Definately a film to add to the home movie collection.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Easy listening with a good beat. this music is for anyone that loves music and likes to hear the words.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the CD and the show.  Nice to hear music that hasn't been played to death on local radio stations (yet!).
B007THA4FI|4.0|Fun to read in light of having read the Harry Potter books.  The motivating forces for adults and teens are well displayed, as well as the hipocrocies for all.  Enjoyable and, at the same time, seriously focused.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book had too many similiarities of the Shades of Grey series for my taste.  While I finished it once I started, I couldn't help but count all the things that were the same with the characters.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|okay so I'm pretty pissed ive bin playing this game on my friends phone and I really wanted to get it but it wont me install it I have a kindle fire and I was pretty sure it would work on here but I guess not
0765325950|1.0|Lack of ebook = 1 star.  I don't buy or read actual books anymore.  You have the right to wait, and we have the right to drive down your reviews.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|A Christmas tradition for us, along with 'A Christmas Story'.  Bought this to replace out old VHS tape which someone borrowed and never returned.  Quite a clever spin on Scrooge.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is intelligent and hilarious. This book is not only interesting, but very entertaining. Absolutely loved it and I appreciate Tina Fey even more somehow.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|This app is so bad it sometime spawns in piano keys and it dose not make the right sound and another bad thing about it is when you miss a key it dose nothing and when you touch the key that you miss it says you missed it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it reminds me of a casino game my husband and I played on our honeymoon on our cruise.  very addicting
0004704754|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter. I like the handy size of the book and the fact that even though the book is small, the print is easily readable. The binding appears to be sturdy. My daughter was delighted to gt it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who can afford to lose some sleep. It's a hard one to put down.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is an excellent read. A great story that is well written and a great adventure. Our nations best doing what they do and we get a front seat for the ride.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|The only issue I have with the purchase was my stupidity in not noticing the European Rating in the lower lefthand corner of the box.<br />And I thought Spanish and French was a lot... They must have 20+ Audio and Subtitleoptions.<br /><br />Other than that confusion it is great!!!
B007EDYN36|4.0|I like how this book touches a little bit of everything but doesn't drag on and on on one topic.
0765325950|1.0|I have read this series from the start and loved it and I will read this book but am very disappointed that the e book version isn't ready at the time of release.  I would be okay with paying hardback price for ebook at the time of release.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game to play. Very addictive, clear graphics and good story line. It was a little difficult in the beginning but caught on fairly quickly.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|One of the hidden objects is behind the menu tab on the right hand side not able to continue game. Also the game cuts u off &amp;takes u back to start page several times thru the game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive game and fun to play. I enjoy playing when I'm waiting for an appointment. Makes waiting a lot easier.
B008C20TDG|4.0|Really got me in the mood to try the Whole 30 and I'm up to Day 12 and feeling great. Highly recommended.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This truly is a beautiful classic, with stories and lessons about love and family that are as true today as when they were so wonderfully written.  A most enjoyable read that warms the heart and feeds the soul.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I was afraid to be let down but both the DVD and CD are top notch. The boys look and sound great. Now I really wish I was there at the concert.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We are catching up with Season 2 Episodes.  We love watching the shows without commercials!  This series is so much fun.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was recommended to me by several friends. I've read other books about NDE's, but none by a neurosurgeon. He represented the clinical aspect as well as the metaphysical. In my own spiritual journey, this just solidifies how I feel about God, heaven, and crossing over. Very powerful. Dr. Alexander also mentions the power of meditation and hemi-sync, which I am also doing resulting in a broader understanding of consciousness.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I just finished the 800+ pages of 11/22/63 by Stephen King in 3 days, and I'm still basking in the afterglow of a brilliant piece of writing.  I haven't read a King novel in about 20 years, but I admit he was once a favourite author.  Due to the subject matter, this book was on my wishlist for a few months, and when I found the Kindle version on Amazon for $3.99 I scooped it up.<br /><br />I read the numerous online reviews posted about the book so I knew that some of the JFK Conspiracy Theorists, the King Horror buffs and the Time Travel aficionados were left feeling unsatisfied.  Also many reviewers felt the book was just too long and boring.  So I thought I was prepared - but I wasn't.  I was more than pleased to find that I just unexpectedly loved the whole story from start to finish.  That's why I'm rating 11/22/63 at 4.5 Stars.<br /><br />I won't retell the story here, as that's already been done in the many previous reviews, but I will share a few of my thoughts as I breezed through this book written by one terrific storyteller.<br /><br />11/22/63 isn't a story as much about the JFK Assassination or Time Travel (and I love those two subjects) as about the relationships and lives of people in the late 50's and early 60's.  I do think the book will appeal more to boomers like me than to Gen X'ers, unless they have a special interest in the era or a love of King.  It was a nostalgic look back at small town America, but King shows us both the good and bad sides of the time period.<br /><br />You will be drawn into the characterizations of our protagonist, Jake/George, and the other major and minor actors including teachers, students, seamy moneylenders and small-time criminals.<br /><br />There is great suspense and action as Jake/George inserts himself into the Dunning Family tragedy.<br /><br />King writes an excellent portrayal of 1958 life in the gloomy and sinister town of Derry, Maine, where Jake stakes things out for 2 months.  Derry eventually translatesinto Dallas, and here King's Yankee bias against Texas shows.  However, to be fair, his depiction of Derry and Dallas are equally distasteful.<br /><br />At the 40% mark, we are introduced to Jake/George's love interest, Sadie Dunhill, in the community of Jodie, Texas.  At this point, some readers might check out because the heart of 11/22/63 is a romance.  But how tenderly King writes this section.  We get a real glimpse into how Jake grows and toughens up when protecting his love, Sadie, and in carrying out his long planned role to stop the actions of Lee Harvey Oswald.<br /><br />It's obvious King did copious research on the JFK assassination, and in particular I liked his handling and inclusion of the mysterious and probable CIA agent, George de Mohrenschildt, Oswald's harridan mother, Marguerite, his wife Marina, General Edwin Walker and Ruth Paine.  Again, for some readers this section will contain too much detail of Oswald's daily life, but not for me.<br /><br />I thought King's use of the conspiracy theory within the time travel plot line was interesting and well-handled.  The pacing of the plot is very well done, weaving the fictional story arc with the factual events of the storyline. King has a great ability to tease the reader by forecasting, but in a totally good and satisfying way.  He really kept my interest in the story.  Then at the 63% mark, both story lines intersect in a very exciting manner.<br /><br />King doesn't get bogged down in the technical specifics of how the \\"Rabbit Hole\\" of time travel works, or who the \\"Yellow Card Men\\" were specifically.  But he gives us enough to chew on, with his concepts of \\"resetting\\" after each bout of time travel, the \\"Harmonic\\" chiming, and the \\"strings\\" that hold up the fabric of reality.<br /><br />The pacing speeds up towards the end of the book, and I felt the ending was a little rushed.  When Jake returns to the 2011 dystopia, I would have liked more details fleshed out about why the world ended up inthat damaged state as a result of JFK not being assassinated.  Perhaps the author might have whittled the middle Jodie, Texas section down a smidgeon and added a bit more to the troubled present.<br /><br />There is much to like and little to criticize for me in this exceptionally enjoyable read. I couldn't put it down and was sad when the journey ended, and that makes it worthwhile in my estimation.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a really nice bag for a great price. It provides good storage space, and is a decent fit once adjusted. I really enjoy it!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|My family has loved this series since it came out. My dad does not watch much television but this is one of his favorites. Excellent series!
B0013ND30M|5.0|They love it.....and you will love a little dowm time while they enjoy it ! A MUST for any grandparent !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book!! I had originally watched the movie version first before reading the book and thought the movie was pretty good, then I decided to read the book to compare the two. I actually watched the movie a second time because I forgot what happened in it and I have to say now, that I don't really like the movie...the book explains in detail while the movie brushes over the important stuff but I just hated how the movie changed things from the book. This book is a must read!!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble is a fantastic singer and adds a little shade of Sinatra to the Christmas song book ! You will love it !
1603427244|4.0|This small volume is a thorough experience for the new and returning knitter; a treasure for techniques, common, and more exceptional ideas.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's much easier to use than the regular website, but I find it won't refresh itself so that your new notifications show up. My only complaint. Otherwise, I love it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Go figure the physical cd was cheaper than mp3 download (and of course CD is higher quality than mp3 as well).<br />Love, love, love this album!<br />If you also dig Adele then be sure to check out the DVD of her performing at the Royal Albert Hall. You can stream it, but do yourself a favor and get the Blu-Ray, especially if you have a good sound system.
B004SBX112|5.0|I found myself playing this for hours! It's fun, but challenging, too. Great for any age. Love all the different seasons.
B0064B1Q84|5.0|I've been a fan of her music for quite some time now and have most of her music, mostly the Italian versions and some in Spanish as well.  I liked her early work at the time, and still do but enjoy her more mature sound even better.  Hopefully she'll be entertaining us for a long time to come!
B000FC10WU|4.0|At first it seemed juvenile but the more I read the more I got into it.  I would recommend it and would read more from this author.
B00AAQWZWU|5.0|Most times when I purchase a complete album, I end up liking a minimal number of the tracks, but this case is an exception.  I just love the majority of them!  Although my favorite style is pop/rock music, even the song \\"Testa O Cuore\\", which has a hip hop sound which I'm not really into, is just fantastico! I have most of his music going back 30 years or more and find that his work just keeps getting better! Hopefully he'll be providing much more like this in the years to come!  The only thing missing is an electronic booklet. They come in handy sometime when the mind can't figure out a phrase here or there. Hopefully future works will have one.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent follow-up to the Fall of Giants. I casn't wait for the third installment of the trilogy to become available.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Best book I've read in many years.  Couldn't put it down!  I. Lent it to my daughter and she had the exact same reaction.
1439102430|4.0|Kathy Reichs has struck diamonds in her newest book. It is fast moving and the reader will learn more about our human body. That is only part of what make her an interesting read. The Fox TV series is bad, but not her writing. From the beginning when you read about three new borns wrapped in towels in a scrungy apartment in Quebec, Canada, to the outreaches of Alberta Province, a twisting road begins. Ms. Reichs has done a lot of research for her new book and she uses it well. This is not a complicated read at all. I found myself reading late into the night because I found it hard to put down. From one character to the other, this book will grip you till the very end. Of course, our hero finds her self deep in trouble near the end of the story, but I will not give it away. From an old lover (Sgt.Olliver Isaac, Quebec Police, who had attended the FBI academy)Temp works with him and her other old flame, Ryan. Why would a woman dispose of her new borns? What kind of a woman is she? From Quebec to Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, and then on to Yellowknife.<br />If you like adventure along with a mystery, then this book is for you.<br />DP
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This item was a gift for my 17 year old nephew. I have seen the movie several times and it is an excellent movie. My experience with Special Edition DVD's ( I own Heat Tenth Anniv. Two disc Edition) is that the extra features allow insight into the making of the films and into some of the meaning and intent behind the film.

B007DIQB50|4.0|I love nicki Minaj that's why I bought this when it first came out, my only problem with it is that I like when nicki spits, this album she only one or two tracks like that, the rest is more pop, and that's why I gave it 4 stars, not because I hate her music I just prefer her tracks she raps on, plus for me her pop songs get overplayed and in enjoyable fast, while her rap tracks get played just enough to where I can still listen to them and enjoy them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book has an interesting start, lots of plot twists and was a good read, but in the end it left me feeling that I hated all of the characters.
B0086700CM|2.0|I'm complaining about the kindle fire because unfortunately I bought the kindle fire for the purpose  of downloading apps. however I have noticed an app restriction because my kindle is registered in the Caribbean region. This is something that must be changed it is not only misleading but dissp<br />ointing.
B00607EWYC|3.0|I tried to listen to this book on MP3 as I walked, but the chapters are so long! Once I purchased the book to complete it, I just could not get into it. Yes, the author tells a great story, but he could have done it with many fewer words.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Downloaded for my son, who loves Minecraft.  Has enough detail and content to keep him busy, without the multi-user online game concerns.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo is one person to one set of cards with a group of other people.  Well this game is the same way.  While you are playing so are many other people and you truly sit there going B11  come one B11.  There are conversations going on and you can join or just focus on your game.  A lot of fun and addicting.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|This monitor is so easy to use with the WithBaby app! I haven't had a single problem with the product. It is easy to see and hear through my iPhone. Since the baby isn't due for a few months we use it as a security camera for now. We also set it up in the bedroom to check the humidity level.<br /><br />When I received this item it had been used already and I learned shortly thereafter that the battery would not hold a charge. I contacted customer service and they immediately sent me a replacement batter. It was so easy! I was so impressed by how responsive and helpful they were!<br /><br />The one downside of the current app is that there is no easy way to add additional users. The company says this is because they have not programmed any permissions thus it is unnecessary and you can just share your credentials with others to give them access. That doesn't work for me simply because I don't like having community passwords. However, you can easily add additional users by uninstalling the app and creating a different account when setting up the app again. Granted, I had to do this two times in order to first add my husband and then add my mother but it wasn't a painful process.<br /><br />This is absolutely the best monitor I have seen on the market. You won't be disappointed!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you like glee you'll love Pitch Perfect. Great music with creative and intriguing arrangements. Decent character development and adequate story line. I'd watch it again.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Love this movie! Then again.. I like all of the &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; movies. Still not a big fan of Dwayne's acting.. but its okay.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved continuing the story of Gideon and Eva always wanting to know what was going to happen next. You secretly want them to stay together but at the same time want it to end. I can't wait for the third book to come out to continue the story and find out where the story is going to go.
075669812X|5.0|This is such a great book for any child who is obsessed with Ninjago characters. My son has poured over it so many times and loves finding new things to look at. Highly recommend it!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The songs bring back the wonderful moments of the movie! Highly recommend it if you watched the movie and enjoyed it.
0062213423|5.0|Great pictures and information in this One Direction book.  It's a great gift for fans with lots of information on the band members.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game has great graphics and the story like is interesting. Would say don't to hard to solve. Does offer options  to skip a puzzle if you decide not to try it, however the puzzles are easy to figure out.
0399160450|5.0|Never stops getting you into the action, Clancy at his best. I never put it down once I started, you will enjoy it.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|great movie for the whole family, no sex or violence. Brendan Fraser plays a great naive guy, and Alicia Silverstone is sweet as the girl who helps him navigate a new world.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed reading this one, my first Gillian Flynn book. It certainly captured my attention. I had to read it until the very end. Yet, the ending was not what I expected. A bit disappointing. I did like, however, Flynn's approach to writing this book. The back and forth between Nick and Amy, written in first person. As someone else mentioned, there is a lot of profanity used in this book, so readers should take note.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This pack of games is pretty fun. The diversity of games to choose from is cool too. I like that you can replay any game you want. It can get a little boring after a while when you need 180,000 coins to open another game though because you don't earn that many coins at a time in each game.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Amazing animation .  The textures of the characters look so real!  Jim Carry is fantastic and this movie will definitely take it's rite-full place in my Christmas classics collection.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love it because I can Doodle and be in the story and so does my kids and husband.my mom also loves to play too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All the kids in my school play it and they all stopped playing temple run when they started playing this if you like running games like temple run you WILL LOVE this game a whole lot more so whoever invented it thankyouverymuch and you are a genius
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The only thing I have to say is if your looking for a good read you found it with this book.
B002BWP49C|4.0|Let's face it, none of the Twilight movies or books are good. They're awful!  Awful... yet a totally addicting guilty pleasure.  I've seen all of the movies several times and read the books more than once. And no matter how terrible the writing and acting is, I'll continue to watch/read them. I thought the acting on Breaking Dawn Pt 1 was not nearly as painful as the others.
B009INAKM8|5.0|Great record from one of the best bands ever. I recommend, no, I -ask- you to get it so you can listen to real good music and stop listening to the whatever is being put out on the radio nowadays.  But seriously, the DVD is very short and because it has early raw footage, it can be a bit painful to hear and watch. Even the menus are underwhelming. The value here, is more nostalgic. There is better footage of them out there on YouTube. (A proper full live Interpol concert Blu ray is due).<br /><br />This is an excellent album and the 10th anniversary edition is well worth it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series for young adults as well as adults. Read the books...they're much better than the movie. (they always are)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this whole series of books! the world that Suzanne Collins creates is so vivid and detailed. plus in the middle of everything else that is going on in the book there is a love triangle added in. There is a little something for everyone in this one battles, thrills, drama, and of course romance!Totally a book you don't want to put down.
0375869026|5.0|Very good book.  My son requested this from Santa.  He was so excited Christmas morning.  I think the book is good too.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I really like the product.  It was very good and easy to use.  Amazon products has been so useful for our family.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther is about what I've come to expect from the Corey books.  While I wasn't overwhelmed with this one, it was entertaining as always.  I just wish Nelson could hit the keyboard a little harder.  Gimme two books a year brother!  I'm reading too much trash in the interim.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are a very unique twist on combine all genres of music with classical. It is something well worth buying and i highly recommended this album to anyone who is thinking of buying it.
B0094KF4WG|2.0|Main attraction of book is a detailed description of the Navy Seal operation to kill Osama Bin Laden. A lot of non related material about other operations was added to 'fill the book'. Clearly written by ghost writer. Lacks pace and comes across as written w a too short deadline ... too hasty
B005H0IW6W|5.0|No doubt Michael Buble has an unique and awesome voice. I found his renditions of familiar classics refreshing and new...not the same old songs you are use to hearing.  I particularly love his duets.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|Captures all of what is so good about the Beevor books about the 2nd WW (Berlin, Stalingrad, D-day, etc.) in a brilliant summary of all the theatres of this war. Amazing how this is captured in one single readable book by the author. Only very minor comment is that the typical personal element (the experiences of the troops in the field and their commanders) is less developed due to the very broad scope of the book.
1476712042|2.0|First of all I want to state that I didn't read this as a \\"ya romance novel\\", but as a description of how people with mental illness end up in bad situations (in IRL Abby would have been one of those women eventually murdered by their boyfriend/husband).<br />If I had read this as a romance novel it would have gotten a one star rating.<br /><br />I thought that the start of the book, and parts of the middle, were a very good description of how two people who are ill, and have had abuse in the past/losses in the past that have damaged them, get together, and why some people willingly go into situations were they get hurt very badly. People always say \\"why didn't she leave him earlier\\" etc, about abuse victims, but this is how it happens, just like in this book.<br /><br />The reason why people like Travis end up with a \\"Abby\\" is that they know that the \\"Abbies\\" will respond to them the way they do, they are like sharks attracted to the smell of blood when they get their sights on someone who will eventually let them be controlled and find the violence (which is at first directed to the people who \\"look at their girl the wrong way etc\\", but will eventually be directed to their partner and children) somehow as a sign that they are loved. A lot of abused women take violence as a sign that they are indeed loved.<br /><br />This is why Travis \\"loved\\" Abby, it wasn't because he loves loves her, but he knows that she will respond to him in a certain way because she shows signs of being abused/damaged at some part of her life. I thought that it was very insightful from the author to never let the reader actually know why they fell in \\"love\\", they were just madly in love without any explanation. I thought that it was because the author knows how these kind of people and situations function, but the ending kind of made it clear that there wasn't some sort of insightful description of how these kind of people operate, but that the author really did think that this kind of thing is actually real love, and a sign of \\"loving\\" too much.<br /><br />There is nothing romantic, sexy etc. about this book, the sexy part especially is totally lacking, I can't see how someone with as much experience as Travis would be so crapola in bed, he just basically shoves himself inside and continues to satisfy himself, and that's it.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, sometimes I thought that the author had excellent insight into selfish damaged *ricks like Travis, and the women who end up with them because they mirror themselves in the abusive men, but the ending made it clear that the author might have thought that this kind of \\"romance\\" is actually a romance. I don't really know if this kind of cognitive dissonance was done on purpose by the author since it is mentioned in the book that their relationship is sick, and what about the white trash mrs. maddox tattoo, surely some of these things had to be jokes made on purpose?<br /><br />Maybe this is just continuation from the Twilight disturbia, where controlling stalkers are seen as something ideal, and cardboard paper female leads are willing to be just be controlled mirages \\"for the sake of love\\".is actually real love, and a sign of \\"loving\\" too much.<br /><br />There is nothing romantic, sexy etc. about this book, the sexy part especially is totally lacking, I can't see how someone with as much experience as Travis would be so crapola in bed, he just basically shoves himself inside and continues to satisfy himself, and that's it.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, sometimes I thought that the author had excellent insight into selfish damaged *ricks like Travis, and the women who end up with them because they mirror themselves in the abusive men, but the ending made it clear that the author might have thought that this kind of \\"romance\\" is actually a romance.

B008DVJMAW|5.0|Gift for my husband.  He loves the music. .There is not much more to say about this CD.  Great if you like genre.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|First RPG i've ever played and it's great. I never wanted it to end; this is the best game on the vita and my game of the year for 2012.
B009X011UQ|1.0|The item recieved does not fit the KIndle HD 8.9 correctly. However it does fit the Kindle HD 7 fine, so I kept I gave as a gift. They should ensure that the item that is shipped correctly correlates to what was advertised. In the future if I see this shipper I will tend to avoid.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|I had mixed thoughts about how Frankenweenie would be as a feature film and as you can tell by the Blu-ray.com reviewer, this is not a movie for everyone.<br /><br />My 3-year old loved it and his beady little eyes were glued to the screen as soon as I put in the disc. The story is simple and touching, and even me, a 30-year old found it fun and darkly charming. A few parts really had me cracking up with simply the crazy characters faces, expressions and voices.<br /><br />The PQ is outstanding as well as the AQ. This is not really a movie which I would want to watch the extras over and over again, however I feel for the type of movie the extras are very ample.<br /><br />One thing to note is the disc management. The Blu-ray case is a standard size case, which is odd because Disney usually gives us a wider case with flip sleeves to hold all the discs. There are no sleeves and there are simply 2 sides to hold discs, and there are 2 discs STACKED on each side. I am not a fan of stacked discs of any kind, however as Blu-ray is a stronger disc than DVD, I don't see having an issue with scratches.<br /><br />If you're a Tim Burton fan you will greatly enjoy this movie and for anyone who has children, they will love it too! I'm so glad I blind bought this and proudly display it in my collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy.I think the second book was just a little dull. But there were items u needed to know. Besides it is a trilogy. I would highly recommend this to anyone.very well written. And I am not a book reader. lol. I can't believe I read the the whole thing.
B004DM0UII|2.0|I imagine this app is going through some growing pains. Maybe I will try it again in a year or so, but right off the bat it did not connect to the first three music genre choices that I selected. Then, when it locked in on to what I was hoping to be an acoustic blues station, I ended up getting a Pointer Sisters song. My next attempt got me some sort of techno/rave dance beat. I am pretty sure that is not even close to Chicago Blues.
0345803485|5.0|This book was fun to read - it kept your interest, and it left you wanting to go out and buy the 2nd book immediately.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|it would not load onto my tablet even though i have android stuff downloaded on it. grandson was really bummed
B002H3F7F6|5.0|If you have given up finding good seasonal music with extraordinary presentation, do not despair.  Get this hauntingly (as in  you can't forget it) beautiful album.  Sting has always been good; this puts him over the top, even if you haven't cared about him before.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing, heart breaking, heart warming book. There are really no words to explain. I can't imagine how much love is in this book.
1426308469|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a young boy for Christmas.  It's large sturdy ,  the pictures are beautiful and colorful.  It nicer than the picture shows.
B00AHEDXXA|4.0|As we have to go back in time to retrieve Agent K, before the world the saved ends as we know ends... again the MIB save the day. the main villian was lame with goggles, but heart warming with other charectors to make up for it. I can't say it was the best,  but I can say it is worth making a MIB 4 over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!!! I'm going to start the next one right a way can't wait !! I highly recommend it
0896760839|5.0|I always wanted to know how these dresses were made, and now I know! love love love love love love
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|loved the series.  wanted to be able to re watch. Would reccomend to anyone who liked it when it originally aired.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Great vid & great service - - Wish I could have been there to see all these awesome players -
B005544V6A|5.0|Best new series in quite awhile.  The storyline, the actors,, the production are all excellent..  Sharply dressed characters, good cases, marginal sexual overtones.  Gives one a real sense of what it would like like to work in a top law firm.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just an amazing read... I loved this book so much! Not only were the sex scenes good but so was the storyline! READ IT!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really fun game, you should try it. Playing this game for hours, can't stop. Very addictive. A must for free games.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I ordered this Blu-ray as a Christmas gift for my son. He was very happy to get this. I was very pleased at how quickly  it was shipped and arrived. Great product and great seller. Thank You
B00APUQT7I|4.0|It was funny.  Good quick entertainment<br />I can't wait for the next Ice Age Movie. I'll see it as well
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I ordered this Blu-ray as a Christmas gift for my son. He was very happy to get this. I was very happy with how quickly it was shipped and arrived.  Great product and great sellar. Thank You
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved the concepts described. It was easy to imagine how this could radically change relationships forever. I recommend this book for everyone! Single divorced child friends etc! Wonderful new perspectives in easy to understand terms.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|mr. DeMille has lost his edge.  John Corey wears thin, have his wife accidentally shoot him, The writing doesn't snap. The CIA guy was interesting, crazy, but interesting.  DeMille is becoming Tom Clancy, They both should develop a new story line and don't phone in the last third of the the book just to keep the Publisher's deadline.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|For all the formulaic pop that is pushed through the airwaves, certain artists seems to stick and Rihanna has been one of them. God knows she's reached such a point of overexposure that one is almost tempted to jump into a pit of vipers if the other option is listening to her duet with coldplay, but when the product known as rihanna hits the spot, she does it right. You don't get points for being sheepish, and why be cautious when you can instead be memorable? And so Rihanna dives head first into the whole good girl gone bad angle, with surprising socially insightful results. We have tracks like umbrella, which was released during the finale of the bush era and worked to heal and shield those that felt hurt during this time. We have dusturbia, with it's talk of thieves and \\"lack of gas in the rig\\", could be referencing both the corruption of wall street and the peak oil crisis, all in one pop song! We continue Rihannas infatuation with gas guzzlers in \\"shut up and drive\\" but she is more than willing to hit the brakes and work that lolita angle for the timbaland produced \\"sell me candy\\" which is a underrated favorite for many...it is simply catchy as a cucumber and considering her material these days...seems downright ladylike. Also a surprise is \\"Question Existing\\" which is a slow burning number in which Rihanna stands in front of a mirror and peels back the layers of pain she has had to endure while in the spotlight...she acknowledges the toll stardom has already taken on her soul....however by revealing herself in such a way she is also signaling that she is in it for the long haul. and don't even get one started on the life imitates art ordeal of hate that i love you, take a boy, and never see your face again.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|good story, I loved the characters, well paced. I enjoyed everything about it.  Liked the hero.  Well done.<br />would make a great movie.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have had this app on my Kindle Fire for over a year now.  I can no longer access the list of reading plans/devotionals and can not find any help to get the problem resolved.  My long term plans still load and I enjoy reading those.  4stars instead of 5 until problems can be fixed.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|loved every song.  the musical arrangement gave a modern take on the old standards.  Rod still has it and this cd sould be a must at Xmas time.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|very conveinent very user friendly very highly recommend ... download it now you wont regret it ... use it prob way more than i should
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games. Some I've never played and some classics too. I like the way they have the games setup. Earning points and buying them with those points: fun!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite game on her Kindle Fire.  It's great on trips and the whole family enjoys the run!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter for x-mas.It came in very quick,in great sharp.My granddaughter loved this movie.Thank You !
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My daughter enjoys this game on her new Kindle Fire.  It's easy and fun for younger children and those learning how to use newer technology.
B005GRTNXC|5.0|Now this is a Leona Lewis i can get behind! Glassheart is much better than Echo in my opinion. Midtempo ballads are what Leona needs to stick to and there are plenty on this album.<br /><br />1. Trouble - is a good lead single and the remix is good as well. I really like this song,but I left wanted more at the end. 8/10<br /><br />2. Un Love Me - is a 'classic' Leona ballad. Love this song. Her voice songs great on this track! 8/10<br /><br />3. Lovebird - if this song is released as a single it could be huge, just like Bleeding Love was. 9/10<br /><br />4. Come Alive - the 1st uptempo song on the album. This song really grew on me. I like the lyrics. 7/10<br /><br />5. Fireflies - this is a gem! Absolutely amazing! from the lyrics to Leona's vocals! The music, the piano, the gospel choir feel! Everything about this song is great! 10/10<br /><br />6. I to You - this song is okay. Good beat. 6/10<br /><br />7. Shake You Up - \\"can you turn the music up a little bit please\\" Another up beat song. Love this song just makes me want to dance around the room! Fun song! 10/10<br /><br />8. Stop the Clocks -  another midtempo love song ballad. 7/10<br /><br />9. Favourite Scar -  good song,  7/10<br /><br />10. When It Hurts -you can feel Leona's emotion on this track! not to mention her vocals are amazing 8/10<br /><br />11. Glassheart - i love this song! up beat, dance track. 10/10<br /><br />12. Fingerprint - 'classic' Leona. Goopy ballad yet as always her vocals are on point! 7/10<br /><br />Over all, this is a great Leona Lewis album! I never really bought her albums but this album is something i can get behind! If you're a Leona fan you must get this album! She comes in heavy with bass and drums all over this album. Her vocals are on fire! Only thing I'd change is that she needs to enunciate. Sometimes its hard to understand what shes saying.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book was really detailed in its descriptions, felt like I was watching movie inside my head...I highly recommend the hunger games trilogy to everyone with an imagination, young and old...
0765325950|5.0|In the first 200 pages, I was a little worried that the threads were drawing together a little too quickly, but by the middle of the book, there is plenty of suspense to keep make it a page turner.  Sanderson provides a lot of moments readers have been waiting for throughout the series.  The epilogue left me with questions I'm sure will make for interesting discussion on the forums after the spoiler locks are removed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Seriously such a great book. I ended up staying up and pulling an all-nighter because I absolutely couldn't put it down. Thank you so much Suzanne Collins!
B0026772N8|4.0|Probably written for a specific reader, one who likes to think on a different plane, outside the box. A challenging philosphical view of life.
B00AF3RDLQ|3.0|After several books in the series now we have an expectation that a certain formula will be followed.  Uhtred will be involved in several small scale skirmishes, his loyalty will be tested, and ultimately he'll side with King Alfred and take part in a major battle where he plays a decisive role.  It's formulaic but what the heck, I like this series and consider them all four to five star reads.<br /><br />In this one though for once Cornwell plays with his formula a little. Alfred is dying and all the kingdoms of Britain are waiting to see what will happen.  Uhtred is sure the Danes are planning to attack but he cannot convince anyone else. And then for the most part they don't attack. Uhtred wanders the countryside trading insults, he gathers intelligence, builds, he travels some more and most chapters end with \\"I know they are coming\\" and the next chapter begins with \\"But they didn't come. Why not? I was sure they would by now!\\"<br /><br />If Cornwell had devoted this to some character development, maybe had Uhtred start to plan his return to Bebbanburg or take an active role in his children's lives or something it would feel less like a waste of pages but as it was, this one struggled to keep my interest. Three stars.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|I thought it was very entertaining. Both Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix really did a great job bringing the story to life.
0451205766|4.0|I flew through this book. The characters are interesting and well rounded.  The Godfather himself is a killer and a ruthless gangster but also man of high moral principles in some ways, and that spurs much of the action in the story as his refusal to get into the drug business causes friction between his family and the other big New York families. Michael Corleone wants nothing to do with the family business but is forced to choose between his principles and loyalty to his blood. Tom Hagen was an orphan raised in the Godfather's home and rises to become his most trusted adviser and he wishes the Godfather would see him as a son but he knows it will never happen. And so it is for all the characters, well drawn and interesting.<br /><br />The exception to this is Johnny Fontane. I found him boring and uninteresting and when the book shifted focus to his story I found myself racing through it to get back to the main story.  And the book has many chapters devoted to this dull story.  I found Johnny boring, I actively disliked his doctor and I think the book loses a star for devoting so much ink to this guy and his crew.  Believe it or not, I never saw the film and I understand they took a lot of Johnny Fontane's story out.  Excellent move, Coppola!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Love, Love, Love this CD<br />I tell everyone to get a copy of it. I love singing it in my car.
0316069884|5.0|The book itself is excellent, although be prepared for some pretty brutal thoughts about how animals are treated in order for us to eat them.  eye opening, and makes me glad I made the choice to go vegan - so we're not hurting animals any more, and letting them live - it's something more of us should do.  Why hurt them and treat them like this, what have they ever done to us?  This book will help you make your decision if you are on the fence.  Go vegan.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is amazing! The storyline is great and always keeps you guessing! This is by far one of the best tv shows I have ever watched. I am looking forward to all the seasons ahead!!!! Definitely comes highly recommended!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|A suspect fantasy story sadly lacking in the high art of great writing and intricately woven plot development, but graphically gory enough to keep a juvenile reader occupied for a space of time. I much prefer the sardonic dry wit and keen insights of Vonnegut.  .  . and so it goes.  .  .
B001THM1J6|5.0|THATS WHAT YOU GET DAN! SHOULD OF CHANGED THE NAME YOU RACIST.  YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS DAN?  YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS!!!
B007V65R54|4.0|I work in finance, so I spend most of my life trying to forecast outcomes. This book does a great job laying out the challenges forecasters face, the mistakes we might make, and how we can continue to make improvements. The author also makes use of a broad spectrum of examples (everything from baseball to weather to elections and more), which keeps the book interesting and helps avoid sounding like a math textbook.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and continuing on to the next two! I can't wait to start the next book very Intriguing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|introduced family to this (4 of us) and within 24. hours we were all playing on different devices. great for a wide age range.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is fun for the animal lover and for those who just like creating a unique building plan.  It's similar to the Zookeeper game.
B000KIPT30|3.0|I product a podcast that has three panelists in-studio.  When we bring in outside guests via Skype, we need to put everyone on headset to prevent feedback/echo of the remote guest.  This allows each user to adjust his-her own headset volume separately.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just plain like solitaire' Always played it on the computer  I dont know what you want. I already said enough
3822837849|4.0|LOVE seeing all the photos in this book. One problem is that the book won't open out enough for scanning purposes or even a really clear head-on look at the pages.  BUT, it's small and compact, and I like that aspect.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King is and never has been a disappointment and 11/22/63 is probably one of his better novels in quite some time.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|we were testing Amazon Prime and we wanted to see this movie when it was in the Theatres but we missed it then so now we enjoyed it on our Sony Blu-Ray
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved it it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time it was awesomely amazing!!! !!
B007MU85D0|4.0|On a whim I got this record. I have listened to it three times in the past few days and it is growing on me. I cannot put my finger on it, but the music is interesting and alluring. Sort of, like, ABBA meets U2, or some such nonsense. You need to get past the  Nordic accent of the singers though... sounds exotic and interesting to my ears but some might find it annoying.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you loved the first book you will love this one. It is more intimate and satisfying than the first. A great romance novel.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent Grisham book, great story, great page turner. If you are a fan of his books, don't miss this one.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Written intelligently, with the utmost care using proper English and extensive, sophisticated vocabulary, Townshend gives an eloquent recollection of his sad, over-privileged adult life.  But far from evoking sympathy, he instead writes so that the reader becomes angry at him for having no will power to stop succumbing to drink, drugs and extra-marital sex over the course of 3 debauched decades.<br /><br />Always wanting to know what went on in his genius mind, after reading the book I discovered there is no genius. Just a stereotypical rock performer with too much money, too many enablers and too much &#34;woe is me.&#34;<br /><br />Missing are whatever deep, or even superficial influences that created the huge FM AOR hits over 3 decades.  Although Townshend lightly touches on a few of the inspirations that produced such powerhouses as &#34;Baba O'Reilly&#34; or &#34;Tommy,&#34; it's not enough.  On the subject of his rock operas, he appears to obsess, but only about the arrangements and productions, not the songwriting. Deaths of major Who members, such as Keith Moon and Kit Lambert, merely warrant passing notes, written narcissistically instead of personally.<br /><br />Interesting, Townshend is not shy when describing his many extra-marital conquests, how he met them, what was done and the inspirations they became for such hits as &#34;You Better, You Bet.&#34;  And there's lots and lots of that.<br /><br />Still, it's an interesting read, especially because he exhibits such intelligence in his writing. Too bad it doesn't translate to a life well lived.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I have read many many many stories in the past 12 months and I have to say Beautiful Disaster has to be one of my all time favourite stories... the characters are so under my skin I am re-reading the story again because I'm not ready to give them up and move on.... if you haven't read Beautiful Disaster than do it now.... before book 2 comes out in April....
B004IFYMYI|1.0|I am giving this movie a single star without having seen it first.  I am trying to get your attention.  The packaging is more like a book with inserts of photos from the movie, about 10 or more.  It is not standard Blu-Ray packing, and does not blend in with the rest of my collection.  I don't like that.  I'm sure it's a good movie though.  Remeember, it was because of this movie that President Reagan was shot...
B000002KGT|5.0|fast shipping,  an oldie but a goodie to keep in your collection  this is one of my favorite groups to listen to
B004LWZW4W|4.0|This plot makes plausible sense and raises many of the same questions as Jurassic Park. When we mess with genetics we open all sorts of unforeseen consequences. CGI is way more excellent than original plus acting is way better
B000002KKC|5.0|The CD is very good and I never get tired of listening to this group.  a must have for me!
B00170GXWG|5.0|Great film made better on blue-ray.  This was and is a great film.  Blue ray makes it even more<br />real and vivid.  One of the few films I don't mind watching over and over.
B005XN0SGU|4.0|I got this to view comic book on my fire. This, in conjunction with the calibre app on my desktop, let me view and manage my library easily.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|We picked up four of these Hipe \\"Automatic Motion-sensing Night Light\\" for use as backup lights in the stairwell of our three story building. We have emergency lights that come on in a power-outage but we recently discovered that someone can turn the lights off on the first floor while someone is still on an upper floor, trapping them in the dark. These were a good choice for us since, in addition to On/Off, they can be set to activate when they detect motion are motion in when the lights are off.<br /><br />These come with mounting hardware (screws & wall anchors, and Velcro tape) and produce enough light to allow safe navigation of the steps.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B005PK553C|1.0|FOR THE $1.99 I COULD HAVE HAD A V-8.  IT NEVER WENT ANYWHERE.  WILL NOT WATCH ANY MORE EPISODES OF THIS
0765325950|1.0|no ebook = no buy<br /><br />it was a terrible decision to not offer an ebook version at release.  that's all i have to say.
B003VANOFY|5.0|thrilled w/ this headset. it is fabulous in every way.<br /><br />my only gripe is the price dropped $25 two days after i bought mine - i am considering buying another one already.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of the games are a lot of fun and I'm glad I downloaded this app.  Some game instructions could be clearer.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game you have to try ! Many challenging puzzels to solve and levels to get through. Played this game as my wife played it also and I finished before her.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Like many reviews on here, I was very excited to view Prometheus when it came out.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time, and thus had to wait until it came out on DVD.  In the meantime I had read the reviews, and my enthusiasm for the movie waned a bit.  Though, after watching Prometheus recently, I was pleasantly surprised with the movie, and a bit disappointed with parts as well.<br /><br />  The movie is beautiful to watch.  From the opening scenes of the Engineer by the waterfall, to the scenes on LV-223 within both the Prometheus and the Engineer's spaceship.  There were scenes tying into the Aliens Universe if you looked hard enough, and enough new territory to make this something new in that Universe.<br /><br />  I thought the acting for the most part was very well done.  Michael Fassbender as David, the cyborg, was excellent, especially his scenes with Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and Dr. Shaw (Noomi Rapace).  Both those ladies did a fantastic job, as did Idris Elba as the Prometheus's Captain.  Logan Marshall-Green's performance as Dr. Holloway was a bit stiff, however Guy Pearce had a complete old-man makeover as Peter Weyland, the CEO of Weyland Corp.  It took me 5 minutes of viewing before I realized that it was even Guy Pearce.  I should have listened more to the voice.<br /><br />  Definitely some of the more frustrating things of the movie was the way the crew reacted when they encounter the Engineer ship,and some of the scenes within.  As others have recounted:  the taking off of the helmets, the two crew getting \\"lost\\" within the spaceship, not being ultra-careful with many ominous canisters lined up in the \\"Head\\" room, ect...<br /><br />The Extra's featured on the Blu-Ray & Digital Copy:<br /><br />*  Deleted & Alternate Scenes - A couple were interesting, and a couple were not.  Not many for a long film.  I did like the scene where at the beginning where they decided to do 1 Engineer rather than many.<br />*  Peter Weyland Files -  4 short files on Weyland's computer.  1 is of a speech made by Weyland in 2023, however I liked the one of an Infomercial for David the Cyborg.<br />*  Prometheus Mobile App so you can interact with your smartphone or tablet when the movie is on.<br />*  Commentary by writer Jon Spaihts and writer/ex producer Damon Lindelof.<br />*  Commentary by director/producer Ridley Scott.<br /><br />I did really enjoy this movie, even with some of the more frustrating behaviors of the crew, and many questions being unanswered.  I have heard this is part 1 of a trilogy, so hopefully our questions will be answered in the future.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|I bought it as a gift for a friend in Greece but it hasn't arrived yet, unfortunately.  I loved seeing MUDDY WATERS AND THE ROLLING STONES ON PBS.
0765325950|4.0|I have managed to read the book now, no thanks to the publisher, and I am struggling between giving it three and four stars. Three, because I didn't get the ending - four, because after all - it is well written, more so than some of the other books in this series. After book one, the two last books are probably the ones I enjoyed the most. But it still irritates me: what was that ending about?<br /><br />PS: I can't be more precise or this review would be the worst spoiler ...

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is hands down my favorite bible application.  It allows you many different versions and translations and is a very fast app.  You can create an account and sync information and posts to social media.  There are dozens and dozens of different reading plans supported that will allow you to read the entire bible in a year or two or three.  You can find plans that let you read the bible chronologically or in normal order.  Interface is clean and allows for customization of the font size and color.  Highly recommend and is the first app i download on new mobile devices.  Avail on all the popular platforms.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I am a writer who enjoys some of the support materials available to our craft.  Among these a dictionary is not only very useful but very enjoyable.  This Merriam-Webster app for Android is phenomenal!  It is quick and thorough and is a class act.  This is the real one... enjoy it!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have been reading SF since the 1950s and have a fair idea of what I like - and really, I had thought I was a bit zoned out with near space adventure.  I was wrong.  I dont know what made me buy this book, but it took my attention from the first page and kept it throughout.  Others have mentioned the expletives saying they were excessive.  Obviously they havn't worked out there in the real world.  After working on a main-line gang in the electrical industry, I found the language in the book is mild and minimal - and I have to say, exactly what I would be using in similar circumstances.<br />The science was plausible to me as a reasonably well-read layman, whether it would work out in real life I dont know, but really, it doesnt have to - Its a story. A good story with humour and a bit of suspense.<br />I am somewhat bemused, as I never thought I would give any story 5 stars, but there it is!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a really well written first person book. You enjoy the smarty pants Percy Jackson. he has to deal with some troubles along the way, but boy is it an adventure from the start. Buy this book!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game and would have given it five stars if not for the glitches.It sometimes freezes and doesn't register my finger swipes. I love the game, though, so overall I give it four stars.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Our 11 year-old son enjoys watching these shows.  He often plays with his Star Wars Lego sets afterwards.  Excellent quality!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I've played every Final Fantasy from IV - XIII-2 and Tactics and this one is just as fun.  I enjoy the battle system and the old-school grinding.  Five stars!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This stuff is weird and seems like they write it as they go with no real plan in mind.  It is fun to watch however.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I had hoped and hoped that Shirley and the boys would put out at least one more CD.  Far better than a lot of the pop junk available today.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Movie has trouble loading in blu-ray player, when none of my other bu-ray movies do. At times the movies completely freezes on screen. This movie is pretty much unwatchable...very disappointing! Would have made you aware prior, but was unaware of this review process. Thank you.
B000P0J024|5.0|I love the sound of The Wilburys. I put it right near the top of my collection. Too bad we lost George and Roy so young. They are all great talents
B0060AY6FO|1.0|I'm not an Austen purist and I've enjoyed other P&P spinoffs.  Death Comes to Pemberly is not one of them.  It is hard to believe that P.D. James is a among \\"the most admired mystery writers of our time.\\" There is very little plot and the author simply rehashes details of the crime until the reader's eyes glaze over with boredom.  The characters of Elizabeth and Darcy are flimsy, uninteresting and unrecognizable.  Don't waste your time.
0765325950|1.0|Just one more complaint about the lack of an electronic version of the book.  My family of five has 4 kindles, 2 Kindle fires, and 3 iPads, and we read on all of them. We don't buy paper books anymore because the bookshelves are already full.<br /><br />Supposedly this was done to protect the legacy of the series. The legacy will actually be all the upset readers who are completely cheesed off by the stupid, ignorant  decision of some out-of-touch individual.  Sorry Brian Sanderson if this hurts your income; I have no desire to support a publisher that doesn't respect me as a reader.<br /><br />I'll eventually read this book, but I'll borrow it from the library to read, and wait until I can get the Kindle version at a paperback price.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This is the first believable space movie, with excellent special effects, and who could forget Robbie the robot or  that Invisible Monster!  The transfer from film to bluray was very well done and so was the sound quality.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|probably the best book I've read in years....if you are a parent you must read this book.  It was so real I searched the internet to see if I could find that this really happened and was not fiction.
B005LAII12|5.0|If you are looking for a funny, irreverent movie with an actual story line and a plot twist then this is it.  My husband and I find it hard to agree on movies, but we both enjoyed this one.  Some funny scenes and even a couple of tears towards the end.  Certainly not for the younger kids, but a good laugh for the more mature audience.  Enjoy!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|In &#34;Two Graves,&#34; Preston & Child continue to demonstrate why their books are must reads.  Their plots have interesting premises, unexpected twists and I always coming away having learned something about a field of science for which I did not know.<br /><br />I found myself, again, staying up too late to turn the page (or press the &#34;advance button&#34; on my Kindle.)
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It had most of the elements, but the timeline was hard to follow.  The &#34;flashbacks&#34; were not obvious.  The tie in to the Bourne series was not obvious (or was just lip service).  Good action.  A few good chases.  At least one good fight.  RedBox has it for $1.  Cost more on Amazon, but you don't have to leave the house to get it or return it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved it!!! IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!! I can't wait to read the next one!!! It was a thrilling ride that I would taken over And over again!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put the book down. Loved the characters, loved the plot,and I didn't want the book to end. The characters are very well developed and the story is just fabulous.  Easy book to read and get lost in.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Absolutely spellbinding.<br />Couldn't stop watching.<br />We watched up to 4 shows a night.<br />To be perfectly honest, it was mesmerizing.
1608871517|5.0|I bought this for a friend for Christmas, he's already read it about 3 times and has gotten costumes made like Michael's.<br />Overall this was the best gift ever.<br />Came packaged well and came on time!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another excellent book by Vince Flynn.  I can't wait till his books hit the big screen. Let us all hope there is really a Mitch Rapp out there!
B000FC12SM|5.0|Very insightful well thought out book. Well explained advice. Can't wait to start writing my love letters. It should really help me in exploring all my feelings.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|My mother loved this. She is a big fan and has had most of the individual dvd's. She was thrilled to have a compact collection so she can have more space on her shelves.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Pretty Fun app I play every day and reap the rewards by opening chests and completing tasks for gold and diamonds
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Very entertaining movie.  They added a few innapropriate comments that added no value or humor, otherwise a very fun movie!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Its pretty good. It's like a mlp sim city where your create your own ponyville . But if you want to play through the whole game for free it will take a lot of patience as the game tries at every turn to get you to buy in-game money (which is a little expensive).<br /><br />Other than that though its fun and cute. Just don't accidentally charge yourself a hundred bucks, its really easy to do.
0756404746|5.0|This book has everything the fantasy addict needs. Amazing, deep characters; a creative new perspective on &#34;magic;&#34; compelling and absorbing plot; and one of the most like-able main characters I've ever had the pleasure of joining in a story.

B003L16FAE|1.0|I have tried and tried and tried, but this blu-ray will just not play on my ps3. I have never had this happen with a disc before, but no matter what I do the system will not recognize it. Very disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|Bought these for my Dad for Christmas since he loves wasting whole days just reading books. He doesn't have HBO or anything so he didn't know about these and they are really well written and in-depth books that will keep him busy for a while.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Lots of misunderstandings to be unraveled in this lively story.  Characters are believable and likable. Easy and quick read. Good way to pass a rainy day!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I absolutely LOVE a movie that I can watch over and over and this one is a great example of that.  It also incorporates a multitude of genres combining romance, action, Science-fiction and thriller.  This is done with such apparent ease that the film doesn't make you feel like you are watching three different movies at the same time. The first time I watched it I was left dumbstruck.  All I could do was just sit and think about what had just unfolded.  After the shock and awe wore off I grabbed the remote and hit play for an immediate round two.  I have NEVER done that with any other movie!  I have now seen it several times and I get something new out of it every time I see it and that's just the story.  The actors are phenomenal!  Leo DiCaprio gives a spell binding performance to equal any other performance and some ways surpass the greatness he had achieved with every character he takes on.  And now on to the lesser known favorites of this movie, Tom Hardy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  I had my eye on these two for a long time and this movie solidified the fact that they were both destined to be huge stars.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt being the Indie darling that he was and still is really proved that he could hold his own in a blockbuster.  He also proved that he doesn't have to play the 'broken' one as he does in most of this other films.  In Inception Leo DiCaprio is the broken one and Joseph Gordon-Levitt acts as his anchor, his rock.  Is there anything this man can't do?  I could go on and on but I wont.  I will just say watch it!  If you don't quite get it, watch it again and then again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this game is great.  Easy to install - no tricks.  Just turn it on and go!

B00AMBH70S|4.0|Lots of action, but somewhat juvenile story line.  My kind of movie though.<br />Actor made it work and weapons were pretty awesome on the drone.
0547848412|4.0|A nice book!<br /><br />I read it as soon as I received it. The book is cheap and easy to hold. Of course the paper is just so so. You know, it is so cheap, so I think is fine.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Phil Phillips debut album does not disappoint. HIs soulful voice brings the lyrics to life in a way not many musicians now a days can. You wont regret this purchase.
B007EECSFA|3.0|If only this book could have been set during WWII or even set during 1963 when it opens, alternating between the two time periods, but no. Like so many books about the past, the present like a narcissistic sister must intervene and try to dominate.<br /><br />The present and the death of an elderly central character are the frame around the other time periods. I loved the parts about the London Blitz and life during the war. I guessed \\"the surprise\\" of the book about midway through.<br /><br />What happens for this reader is that I skim the present action chapters and read the others deeply. This is a graceful writer, who clearly did some research because details about the '40s feel so real.If only we could have spent more time with them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! I have  never been much of.  Reader bit I couldn't put this one down.  I felt .myself playing it out like a movie as I read along.  I feel in love with Ana as a person- Christian however.... Errr!!!!
B004LSO6YI|5.0|Was a nice movie about falling in love and all the trials surrounding it.  It centered around a woman you has never had a homosexual relationship (never thought about it) and falls for a woman whose always known what she wants.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I love this free app for printing with an HP wireless printer. I'm not a huge tech nerd, so I can't give you all of the specs. Think of this as a review for regular folks who happen to have a smart phone and an HP wireless printer of some kind.  My printer isn't fancy, just one of the photosmart models from a few years ago. My printer is not a model that states it will work with cloud printing specifically like some newer models nor have I tried it using this app to see if it would work if I leave the printer on when I'm away from home.<br /><br />My printer is connected to my home wifi and as I already had the WEP key in my Samsung Galaxy Epic phone this app connected and was working immediately without any set up hassles.  I had more trouble figuring out how to connect to my printer using my actual laptop software than with this app.  I print email attachments whether in Word, PDF or jpg photos just fine directly from the app.  For the many photos I've taken using my smart phone, this app is a great way to make a quick print before I move the files to a computer. I simply choose the paper size 5x7 or the 8.5x11 drawers where I've loaded either regular paper or photo paper.<br /><br />As an update, I recently bought a newer HP printer to get eFax as a feature and I got a Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. The ePrint does work quite well.  I had already set up my profile, so for a free added functionality for my home printing needs this app is quite useful. The only odd thing with the tablet is that with the older printer, to use this app at home with a printer connected on wifi, I must turn on bluetooth on the tablet as well as wifi. With my Samsung Galaxy phone, wifi alone allows me to print photos or documents directly from my phone using this app without going through the cloud service.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|At times, the back and forth fighting became exhausting and it got so stressful at one point I just wanted to scream \\"STOP NOW!!!\\"  Because of this, I was really surprised at the tidy, story book ending.  It just didnt seem like it suited Travis and Abby's characters. However, I did enjoy it and would recommend.  I do look forward to reading his POV.
0062200909|5.0|much bigger then the picture seems, a thick and amazing book. i seriously recommend this book for the art and background on character designs.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is done with descriptions and use of all the new electronic gadgets that we have in our world now.  Done very well and it makes you laugh.
0811876373|5.0|This book is adorable.  The beginning has easy to follow tutorials for your basic cake pops and balls (pictures included).  But most of the book is super cute ideas to decorate them.  Absolutely recommended.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Original was interesting and quite addictive. Wasted a lot of time on getting thru different levels. Then they updated it and added a lot of silly extras which you need to buy \\"diamonds\\" for with actual cash. Seems to me that not enough players were prepared to spend money on the original so they made it harder to get anywhere unless you spend some real cash. I wouldn't bother going thru all the tasks to find out how it works - only to find that you have got to pay hundreds if you want to \\"succeed\\" in the quests.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The real story from the people who lived it! The media is so misguided and biased, it's nice to get the truth for a change. Thanks, thoughts, and prayers to those who have and those who still serve. Your sacrifice does not go unnoticed.

1452101248|4.0|This is a gourmet vegetarian cookbook so if you haven't cooked a lot before then this book could be more complicated then bargained for. I love to cook, and I have been cooking for years so it wasn't too intimidating but I did have some hesitations.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I liked the imagination put into creating a scenario where the struggle to determine right from wrong is no longer guided by any laws.  Can make one re-think human character in a new light.  I'm left with always thinking about how I might handle those type of situations if I were in a similar circumstance.  No matter how many zombies they dispatch, it always makes the same splattery sound.  Puts a little unintended humor into an otherwise somber story.  And believe me, the great gunslingers of the US wild west would be in awe of how accurate these guys are with pistols shooting the zombies right in the head every shot.  Incredible if a little unbelievable to anyone who's ever shot pistols.  I can't believe how well the producers have come up with new stuff for every episode.  Just when you think they have survived the most horrendous circumstances, they encounter something completely new and unexpected.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The book was more involved but I thought that this was a pretty good adaptation to screen. The screenwriter was able to glean the important parts from the novel, and successfully keep the story. I felt that the book was more intense.
B00AXVZUCY|5.0|Although I have zero tolerance for shows featuring random violence, I love revenge.  This series has everything: wonderful acting, amazing plot twists, breathtaking action, character development, mystery, romance, and even great wardrobes.  I am hooked and for me, this is rare.  Bravo.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I play for 5 minutes or 5 hours, it is loads of fun. The sizzling lightening bolts and explosions add some excitement. I can imagine where a player could strategize for higher points, but I like to mindlessly play &amp; I am rewarded with the flying stars &amp; other extras so it's never frustrating.  I totally love it!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Gift - got high reviews.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|At first I wasn't impressed because it doesn't look like much in the packaging, which I was surprised about considering it was a decent price for a case.  I used it with the kindle and found that the kindle fit very snuggly into the case.  It appears well made and durable.  It is very lightweight and slim, adding very little bulk to the kindle.  It works just as described.  I am pleased with this purchase.

B004JK61K0|5.0|Very easy to install and setup is also easy. Works great if you have more than one email account.<br />Also the price is right.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Works great. I laughed to myself when the temperature of my CPU stayed the same during a Prime95 test. Installation was a bit challenging to figure out how it attached to my motherboard. Ended up watching youtube videos for that.<br /><br />This fits in most mid-tower cases but it blocked a fan spot for me. If you are doing a mATX build in a small tower you should be concerned about space.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy does it again! This is yet another relevant tale of international intrigue and non-stop action. The only bad thing about reading one of his novels is waiting for the next one.
0765325950|1.0|Having purchased hardback copies of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series, I repurchased Kindle editions and reread the series in anticipation of the final book.  Harriet, this deliberate delay will taint Robert Jordan's legacy and dishonors his commitment to his readers.  To say the least, I along with so many of Mr. Jordan's readers am greatly disappointed in your decision.  I find I cannot make myself purchase the hard copy and feed into what I see as manipulation of Mr. Jordan's readers.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was a little disappointed in that some of the characters are just left hanging.  what was the last word brieanne said.  what happened to bran, horder, and the others. jon and ghost never should have died.  it seems that daniels just got bored and stopped writing.  I couldn't figure out what happened to dragon queen.  more , more, more please.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really liked it, it was cool Greg finally danced with a girl Rowley was dating Abigail so he was happy and it was a good book
0817439390|2.0|I bought Understanding Exposure because almost every professional photographer you ask recommends this book.  Just google &#34;best photography books,&#34; and you will see it on nine out of ten lists. I can understand the praise from those who read the book before the I telnet was common, but I wouldn't advise anyone to spend the money today.<br /><br />First, I found Peterson's writing style to be very dry and I terest-draining. I could only read one or two pages a day before I would start falling asleep.<br /><br />Second, I found no information here that wasn't available online for free, and usually presented in a much more concise and interesting manner.<br /><br />My advice: save your money and do some Internet research on the exposure triangle.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I got this for the alarm clock function. I use it on my Kindle fire. I use this alarm clock every morning. Every aspect of it is programmable. The times, the tone, the snooze parameters and more. I pretty much leave it at default and am very happy with the tone, the gentle but increasing volume of the tone.It also has a stopwatch or timer function which I have yet to use.  Excellent and well worth it.
B000UBONPW|5.0|This is a classic Blues CD you'll like it if your a Blues fan. Both artists are great.Buy it you'll lke it!

B0019EXZY4|3.0|The Bank Job (based on a true story) tells of a bank heist ordered by some UK government officials in 1973 to recover compromising photos of a member of the royal family. Wanting deniability, a mid-level official gets his sometimes girlfriend Martine (Saffron Burroughs) to put together a team of robbers who won't know the true objective. The robbers think they're only in it for the money. Lots of other entanglements (like various crime lords and the legitimate police investigation of the robbery) make the job and the getaway a lot more difficult and a lot more dramatic. Jason Stathham plays the guy organizing the heist and trying to keep things together in the fallout afterwards.<br /><br />The story is pretty interesting. A lot of the complications seem like they'd be contrivances but that \\"based on a true story\\" under the title makes them more acceptable. For example, a ham radio operator stumbles on the frequency the robbers are using on their walkie-talkies and the police get involved earlier than anyone expects. The conclusion is satisfying if somewhat more Hollywood than I imagined it would be.<br /><br />This movie does need some major warnings. First of all, there's a lot of sex and many naked women running around in it. Way too much for my taste. The language is pretty bad (standard R-rated fare). The violence is only occasionally but rough and realistic. Which brings me to the other warning this movie should have. If you're a Jason Statham fan, you might have a certain expectation when it comes to action scenes. He's a great fighter and has lots of style, something my wife and I enjoy seeing in his other movies. There's none of that in this movie. He's a tough guy and does beat up one guy, but no fancy martial arts or fight sequences are on display. He gives a fine performance otherwise.
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|I needed to improve my memory and after taking a \\"peek inside\\" decided to give this book a try.  I don't regret it.  I will recommend it to all my friends.

B002G1YPH0|1.0|Got this for my Pentium G860 at 3ghz because the stock could not keep it under 100F. This thing only doped my temps by 10 degrees. For a heat sink 4x the size of a stock I was expecting 20+ , I even used arctic silver 5 on this thing and it is not helping. My case is the HAF XB so im wondering if this coolers was not meant to be standing strait up. Ill see if I can send it back and get some other brand. Cooler master is good on cases but the fall way short on coolers.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play it with kids and grandchildren. just watch out for those who abuse it and report them as soon as possible. great fun!
B009GYSQV6|2.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of CC. I listened to their debut album until my ears would bleed, and had CC II in my possession within hours of its release.<br /><br />CC(I) was fantastic, and CC(II) was exemplary, a light that never goes out in the darkness that is modern music<br /><br />CC(III), however, sounds more like the prequel to CC(I). The production is uninspired and songs begin to grind together to make a big, soggy mash. As for the lyrics, they just come across as a silly gimmick, the tired icing on a lazy cake; we get it Alice, you are HXC, or something...it's like Ethan Kath is taking CC less seriously, while Alice Glass is taking it TOO seriously. CC(III) just seems watered down after the last two albums. I think that I expected too much from this album, and that Crystal Castles are hitting their sophomore slump an album late. Maybe I am just getting older.<br /><br />I guess it is worth noting that after seeing them live a while back, I do not know how Alice Glass is even still ALIVE, let alone making music. I have never seen an artist so manic and crazed during a performance, although I thought the stage-drinking was rather silly (once again, HXC!!). Despite my disappointment, this isn't necessarily a *bad* album. It is just the price you pay for creating a magnificent album...the follow-up effort is going to pale in comparison.
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Love Downton Abbey... 5 stars<br /><br />not being able to watch episodes prior to, or at least the same day they will broadcast on PBS... 2 stars!!
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I read all the reviews and thought I'd still let my daughter give it a try. I locked the in app buying so she wasn't able to buy anything. She played for an entire hour and gave up on it to never go back. She is six and knew she couldn't progress any further without using real money. That's not even the problem. It isn't a few dollars here and there. I'm shocked at the price of most items. Hundreds of dollars could go into this game for virtual items. One pet was one hundred dollars after you bought enough bling to buy it. Really? Again, not the biggest issue. To progress in the game you had to buy bling to get a certain pet or do something. Becomes not very fun way to quick. Very cute game, just ridiculous you can't go past a certain point without handing over month's worth of your child's allowance.

B00A8V3VVG|5.0|As usual, Tarantino delivers a quality soundtrack for an amazing film.  I bought it immediately after seeing Django Unchained last weekend.  I was surprised that many of the dialog excerpts were from cut scenes.  It's a nice addition to have these extra bits.  The only weak point is the James Brown/2pac mashup.  It's not bad, but it doesn't live up to the quality of the other tracks.  I would have rather had that track bumped in favor of the excellent Johnny Cash song from the film that for some reason didn't make it onto this disc.  That's a tiny nitpick, though.  If you like the movie, you'll love the soundtrack.  Don't listen to it before you see the film, though.  You'd only be spoiling it for yourself.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This continues to be a highly watchable drama. There are some suitably gruesome and shocking moments but it's the characters that keep us watching.

B009YQJ322|5.0|Like some other reviewers, I am biased regarding this film.  I love the Dredd comic and I've been reading it since I was a kid.  Although this movie does not exactly match the Bolland/Ezquerra aesthetic, I think it does an excellent job of bringing the world and characters to life.  This movie suffered from a lackluster advertising campaign and sadly performed poorly at the box office.  However, do not be deterred!  This is the best comic book translation you will ever see!  This was the hidden gem of 2012 and blows Whedon's cheese-ball Avengers movies out of the water.<br /><br />This movie is bleak and violent, just as I always imagined the world of Dredd.  However, it is delivered in a cinematographic style that is beautiful.  From the first moments of aerial shots of Mega-City 1 to the cramped interior of squalid apartments, I was struck by the richness of every scene.  I will agree with some critics that the slo-mo scenes can be a little drawn out, but I'm willing to give the director a pass on that one.  Throughout the movie, the action is fast paced, but doesn't seem rushed; I never felt like it was dragging, or that action was being thrown on the screen for its own sake.  Each scene makes internal sense and moves the plot along fluidly.  Plot-wise, this movie is simplistic, but that is part of its appeal.  In the comic, Dredd views his world in black-and-white terms, there is no room for moral ambiguity, and I believe the plot of the movie showcases this aspect of the comic superbly.<br /><br />The actors in this movie all gave outstanding performances.  Urban in particular nailed his role as the titular character.  The supporting cast were all emotionally convincing and intriguing, but without ever outshining Urban as Dredd.<br /><br />Lastly, this movie has an amazing soundtrack.  I enjoyed listening to the original scores (and rare outside songs) during this movie as much as I enjoyed Zimmer's work in Inception.  Music is very much subject to personal taste, but I feel that the scores in this movie wonderfully match the look and feel of the visuals.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the comic, there are numerous easter eggs to pick up, i.e. buildings named after significant figures in the life of the comic, and a movie poster advertising Krysler's Mark.

B009GESJH2|2.0|He's slipping... Only one song on the CD that I like. Bought tickets to concert before I bought the CD. Mistake! After listening to CD I sold the tickets at a small loss.
B005LAII80|2.0|I took a chance buying Dredd thinking it might actually be decent. 20 minutes in and I was already checking the time in hopes it was over. The original film is chessy but fun. This version is lame. The 3-d is nothing to get excited about. There is little or no depth as it falls short of prior released 3-d films from 2012. I can't believe any director or producer actually signed off on this.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Simon Baker is more than good looking. He carries off this bizarre character with great humanity. Lisbon needs a couple more dimensions.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book. Classic Stephen King<br /><br />I couldn't put it down.<br />It was a nice piece of fictionalized history. Buy it.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|One disc skipped because of some  smear on it but worked great when I cleaned the stuff off. Might have been sticky fingers on my part. Arrived timely and in great shape. Season three is not the Mentalist's best.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Well, this item is exactly what it says it is. It has the &#34;remastered version&#34; (Han shot first!!!) and the original version (yay!). The only problem is the the original version is much smaller on screen than the remastered version. This was a little disappointing. All in all, exactly what it says it is.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|While he makes many worthwhile points between small versus large human  beuracracies and that of natural science,  I can't quite buy into waht appears to be an overly strong libertarian bias and a few toom many comparisons where he seems to think a meme and a biological predisposition are the same instead of similar. never-the-less the book makes me think. I'm glad I bought it, read it and would recommend it to selected others.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I don't care if these books lack literary merit, they are fun fun fun to read!!  I never buy books, but couldn't wait for the library to get me the 2nd and 3rd of these books.  People can knock these books all they want.  I haven't had so much titillating fun reading a book...well ever!!  So, though they may be porn with a weak plot, I will stand by my review of these books because sometimes a good book to escape with is better than all the Booker T. and Pulitzer prizes out there!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Awesome Story....lots of unexpected moments.  Definitely thought the ending was going to be a bit more satisfying but overall it kept my interest.
B006O7XOOW|5.0|My daughter loves this toy. She plays with this toy constanly I'd order this toy again. The great thing about this toy is she can play with it for about another year.

0316227706|5.0|Casteel did an awesome job photographing the pups underwater.  Cute, hilarious, fun.  Everybody who visits looks through the book.  Order today!
B005OHSD3A|5.0|Lots of new info, particularly on newer research.  Some great suggestions not made in earlier versions of the diet.  Written in a user friendly way.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|This movie highlights the minimal difference between man and primate.  Animal lovers with find this movie very satisfying since the 'abuser' becomes the victim.  The movie also highlights the devastating impact of brain disease on both the inflicted and his/her loved-ones.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book, Fifty shades of grey, is very intruiging and get's under your skin. I could not easily stop reading.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|A very well told love story with a great spark between the characters. Has a definite &#34;Nicholas Sparks&#34; feel to it and not just because of the leading lady. The love story jives in the same way as his typical(though not his work). If you enjoy his works this will meet your standards as well.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it shines a light on exactly what people like me (data-nerds) need to know for how to create change.  Data is nice and should certainly play a large role in public policy (e.g., guns), but &#34;real change happens SEE-FEEL-CHANGE and not THINK-ANALYZE-CHANGE&#34; and we need radical change in many ways.
B008KEQMDC|4.0|Witty, star filled comedy. Some of the jokes leave you wanting a bit more(or less) but overall it is definitely a good watch. A bit more drama than a lot of romantic comedies, but it kind of helps balance it.
0385342063|5.0|With I’ve Got Your Number, Sophie Kinsella has done it again…a delightful modern-day love story that is so fun it’s a guilty pleasure.  The perfect summer confection.  I laughed and eagerly turned the pages to see what kind of situation our heroine, Poppy, would get herself into next.  Her earnest, wide-eyed excitement over her engagement to Magnus (so British, don’t you love it?) was endearing.  Magnus is quite a catch.  He’s a dashing and debonair professor at La-Tee-Da University, who comes from a long line of intellectuals.  Poppy can’t believe her luck or the gorgeous emerald family heirloom ring he’s given her.  But after a whirlwind engagement and only ten days till the wedding, there are some tiny, tiny red flags.  I just knew things weren’t going to go smoothly for her.<br />The book opens with Poppy losing the ring…in a typical convoluted, far-out there, yet totally plausible way that only Kinsella can dream up. Poppy is afraid to tell her fiancé, because it was just so careless.  There’s also the small matter that Magnus’s family doesn’t seem particularly excited about the wedding.  Poppy doesn’t want to rock the boat and prove to his family that she’s just a silly, dimwitted girl, as Poppy believes they perceive her.  Poppy has some self-esteem issues, as well as some abandonment issues, because she lost both her parents in a car accident.<br />In another so-crazy-you-can’t-believe-it twist, which I know may drive some readers crazy…but it’s a means to an end, so I suggest just going with it…Poppy’s phone is stolen.  She miraculously finds another one in the trash bin, which she decides to “borrow,” claiming finders-keepers, rather than taking the time to go get another phone.  Then of course, she gives out the new number to everyone and anyone, as a contact for her lost ring.<br />The mobile turns out to belong to the PA of yet another dashing man, Sam Roxton.  However, the PA quit her job and her final act wastrashing the phone, quite literally.  With-in minutes of finding the phone, Sam is calling it constantly, which perhaps should have been a sign for Poppy to toss it back in the bin.  Poppy, comically and uniquely manages to save a big deal for Sam, and then informs him that he owes her, and pleads with him to let her keep the phone, until she finds her ring.  Sam begrudgingly agrees, but only until her ring is found.<br />Over the course of the next few days, Poppy gets to know Sam, both by texting him (she ends up acting as his defacto PA) and by reading basically all his e-mails (even the personal ones), which she can do, since all his e-mails seem to go through his PA.  She totally snoops.<br />Predictably, Poppy and Sam are opposites.  She says (or writes) too much and is big on “lol,” “xoxoxo,” and lots of “s”.  Sam is all business, direct and to the point, “Yes,” “No.”  Poppy’s attempts to change the way he communicates with his colleagues gets her, and there for him, into all kinds of trouble.  Then there’s also the fact that she’s gotten a few cryptic, anonymous messages that appear to be nothing, but in fact end up being HUGE deals.  Before you know it, Poppy is totally wrapped up in all the corporate intrigue at his company.  Sam can’t save his mentor or the company without Poppy’s help.<br />The more time that Poppy and Sam spend together, instead of texting, they realize they have a lot more in common, than they realize.  Fundamental things.  Things that define a person, things only they can understand.  Problem is they don’t communicate in the same way.  Of course, Poppy begins to develop feelings for Sam, whom she’s not sure would be paying any attention to her, if not for the all corporate espionage.  We can’t forget about Magnus, either.<br />Poppy is a great character, with the obvious exceptions of stealing a phone, lying about her ring, and secretly having a relationship with another man, albeit mostly by text.  I honestly couldn’t hold any of these things against her.  Seriously.  She was sweet, smart, funny, very kind and believed in the good in everyone.  She’s also kind of alone in the world.  In the end, I just wanted Poppy to have her happy ending.<br />The texting angle, and our total dependence on “smart phones” was very timely and it really worked.  I am probably one generation removed from texters, but perhaps there is hope for our fast fingered friends, that they do actually communicate and get to know one another….kind of a throwback to the letter writing of days past.  There was one particularly romantic text exchange between Poppy and one of her suitors, which actually made my heart flutter.<br />The ending was awesome, totally made you want to stand up and cheer!  Oh, and the ring is eventually found, and has quite a little story itself.  I must say, everything was connected and resolved at the end of the story, tied neatly in a bow.  It was masterful.  This book would be a perfect romantic comedy for the big screen.  I’m thinking Colin Firth, Hugh Dancy and Emily Blunt.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|The story plot is amazing. Lots of twists and turns, has you on the on the edge always wondering what is next.
B000001ELF|5.0|I remember walking into Kmart at about six years old in 78'. The four Kiss solo albums had just been released and the place was decked out in full promotional swing/overload. It was magical. My parents let me pick just one, I wanted to be a guitar player so Ace was the choice.  I can recall the heaviness, complexity (for a &#34;kiss&#34; album) searing guitar solos and Ace had a unique voice. More years passed than I care to remember (over 25 for sure) and this album called me back. Did it stand up to the ears of a trained forty year old guitarist the same way it inspired the kid? Absolutely, probably moreso. I love the drum and guitar interplay throughout and there is a great nod toward Led Zeppelin's rave up section of &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; found within &#34;Snowblind&#34; that I particularly liked. I can now understand why Ace can keep touring and playing this album to devoted crowds and I would be more inclined to see Ace in a club than the quasi-kiss in an arena!
B00005JKNF|4.0|The product was excellent, the movie sucked.....don't waste your money on this movie.  I think this was the worse movie I ever saw.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book, first on my kindle. Enjoyed it very much. I look forward to purchasing the second and third books.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|I give this a five star. It is always good to see evil fought with evil. Selma is always hot! go see.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I got this as the app of the day a while back, great game, great graphics, one of the best deals I ever made on my Kindle, yup...
B0095R64AO|2.0|Like the engagement this movie was stretched out more than it should have been.  It was funny but felt like it was dragged out.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book keeps you hanging on to every word! Love it! Highly recommended! Can't wait to read the next book
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|In all it was a pretty good movie.<br /><br />Disliked:<br />At some point there is talk about a closed loop. Without research I found it a little unclear as to the original cause of it all, it bugged me for a little.<br />There are a few scenes in the movie that seemed would be of great importance later, but were not. I'd rather have had more explanation of the time period, how things came to be, and more development on the secondary important characters.<br /><br />Liked:<br />Dedication to making Levitt appear to be similar to Willis<br />Does not drag, the movie develops nicely throughout the film without giving away immediately what would happen next -- it was fun to discuss/guess thoughts of what would happen next.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I'm trying to change my wardrobe sbd being about to put outfit ideas in one place is great!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is very well done.  Just didn't know that it wasn't the whole game when I downloaded it.  Might buy it in the future.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This series , which looks great on blu ray, is a improvement over the first one. And that is saying alot. However this is really a drama mostly with a few action scenes and finally a battle spisode. The lack of battles in this show is due to budget restraints but the acting and plotline make up for that mostly. Still this is a show that deserves a 13 episode run and not just 10.  But once again it's probably the budget restraints as the sets and customes and such are incredible. The whole show is first rate and even the low ratings are not really putting down the show.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It's a great game. I enjoy playing. I like the different variations and the new birds.<br />I like the Rio setting.
1419705849|5.0|9 year old and myself are addicted and tickled pink with DWK series. Hysterically funny.  So realistic its very easy to relate to.
0765325950|3.0|I have read this series of books since 1992.  I've read the books over and over as each new release has made it to the shelves.  I felt horrible when Robert Jordan passed away, and was pleasantly surprised when Brandon Sanderson took over and did such a great job.<br /><br />I was disappointed at how a series that has been a part of my life for over 20 years has been ended, though.  I felt that MOL was rushed, of all things, ignoring the plethora of characters that have been introduced over time to focus on battle scenes that are not central to the story.  It leaves unanswered questions, and many of the revelations seem contrived.<br /><br />The sense of closure is great, since we finally get to see the ta'veren do what they were born for.  Some of the deaths are shocking, some don't seem in keeping with what you'd expect to happen, and some are predictable.  There are some great twists and turns and there are some that you've probably been aware of since the mid 90's.<br /><br />I wonder if some of the things that happen in the book were actually approved by RJ, or if they were added because someone felt that they would make a better book.  The feel of the story is off somehow.  I'll read this novel over and over again like all the other books in the series, and I hope in time that I come to enjoy it more.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.  This book is not a legendary end to an epic series, but is an end.
0345803485|5.0|Great plot keeps you on the edge of your seat all of the way through book three. Absolutely love this trilogy!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Beautifully written surprising adventure, threaded with deep and real emotions of sadness, loneliness, hope and joy. Poignant, memorable and wonderful.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I have not received it yet, however, due to very old family investments which I still own, I am able to see certain movies before they are released. This happens to have been one of them. I still want to buy it when it is available for sale, but it is excellent!!!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Bought this movie for my husband - one he'd wanted for a long time!!!!  He really loved it - has watched it several times since receiving it.  Has become a valued movie in his sci fi movie collection.  A truly overlooked gem!!!  Sci-fi fans will find it a worthwhile addition to their collection!!!!  Don't pass this one by!!!!
0060899220|5.0|If you are a fan of Anthony's you will definitely enjoy this book.  Being a cook myself in my earlier days, I definitely related to some of his stories.  Well written and an easy read!
0316228532|5.0|Have not had a chance to read this as yet, but have read the storyline on the book jacket and it looks to be an excellent story!!! Know I will enjoy it as much as the Harry Potter books!!!!  Rowling is a great storyteller and am quite sure that this book, her first novel for adults - will not disappoint!!!!  I am very much looking forward to reading it!!!!!  Will add to this review after I finish reading it!!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it, I can't wait to see the movie. I haved loved every book I've read by Nicholas Sparks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|well it was pretty awesome.....while it lasted. it locked up on ke while i was on my way to school i decided to play this and it opened the app store and when i connected to wifi it said open so i tried and it wouldnt open still lol sadface!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the design and it remembers every calculation (as stated above). Very awesome. A must have. Never lags or force closes. I'm in love.
0812971825|4.0|It was chosen for a book club and I'm glad it was.  Our group had a great discussion about the characters as well as the story the author told.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Can not stop watching this movie. Makes me laugh and its a good heart movie also. Its an awesome movie! Well done!
B009P0U7H2|4.0|The author alternates between recent history, personalities and explaining the hard science of modern nuclear physics in an approachable way.  Just as you are tiring of descriptions of bosons, mesons or other &#34;ons&#34;, Sean Carroll lightens the plot with some stories of the people and history behind the LHC.  The explanations of the hard science are easy enough for amateur science fans and were equally helpful for my high school age physics studying son.  Carroll's explanation of particle and field theories finally made the whole wave/particle nature of light clear to me, after 40 years of head scratching.<br /><br />More fun than you would expect of this hard but important topic.
B0092QITO2|4.0|I feel this film is good as the original, but not as close to the source material as the original version. That being said, this film was more like a Philip K. Dick novel, in the fact it was bleaker than the Schwarzenegger version (1990) and keeps in Dick's tone of that bleakness (apocalyptic world, et al.) I am also a sucker for Len Wiseman's films (the Underworld series), they are guilty pleasures.
B008K5T5AI|4.0|Iain M. Banks uses his normal array of knife missiles, sentient spaceships and parallel humanoid evolution to explore the benefits or otherwise of ascendence to a higher state.  As a fan of previous culture novels I enjoyed this, even though there is not much shock value any more.
B004B63M1S|4.0|As a fan of Robert Rodriguez, this follow-up to 2007's &#34;Grindhouse&#34; was funny, sexy and wholly entertaining. Great fun! Much recommended!
B007RI56NY|5.0|Great music as expected! Very happy and what I come to expect from Train. You cant go wrong with this purchase
B007REV4YI|5.0|Loved this film in the theaters! Forget the haters, this was one of the more fleshed-out Bond films in years. Great direction by Sam Mendes, great score by Thomas Newman, great villain in Javier Bardem, (just as chilling as Chigurh was...) Daniel Craig owns the character, he re-invisioned in Casino Royale (2006). I can hardly wait for the Blu-Ray release!
6302248299|5.0|Got this for grandkids. Along with other movies of this era, our grandkids really enjoy the older movies with the simple morels and stories.
B001ECDVYK|4.0|This film had a great transfer, there is some grain but the film is 17 years old. I was saddened however that there were no extra features. Otherwise a great picture, great sound!
0446581356|1.0|The &#34;application&#34; portion of the book (1st half of book) is extremely basic. If you've been applying makeup for more than a year, you already know how to do what she instructs. I was really hoping for some real problem solver ideas. For &#34;problems&#34; she uses models who seem to already have a face full of foundation b/c you can't see their &#34;problems&#34; that need to be fixed. I wish she would have models with absolutely no makeup so we could see a real transformation when hiding dark circles or pimples etc. If she couldn't find models who didn't look photo-shopped the moment the awake in the morning, she could have gotten very attractive &#34;regular&#34; women to transform with makeup. I'm not talking about turning a plain Jane into a movie star or drag queen. I'm talking about women with real, *visible in the &#34;before&#34; photos* skin issues! We all have them even if they are minor. Wish I would have gotten Jemma Kidd's book. May order that to see if it has any actual transformations & not just &#34;Photoshop Perfect to Super Photoshop Perfect&#34;!  The 2nd half of the book is for makeup artists so it's useless for regular women. That wouldn't have mattered at all though had the 1st half of the book had some new/special information that most women already know anyway.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Seth McFarland rules!!! As a long-time fan of &#34;Family Guy&#34;, &#34;American Dad&#34;, and the &#34;Cleveland Show&#34;, I loved the plugs of &#34;Flash Gordon&#34; especially, having seen the film as a teen-ager in 1980. Everything you expect from the man who continues to push comedic boundaries!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I recently started reading and thanks to comments readers put I am able to find good books this one was a great book with an ending that made me cry. A very good read.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My 8 year old daughter loves playing Angry Birds. Hours of entertainment in a new venue. We loaded this on the new Kindle Fire.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This is one of the best period dramas ever, with incredible acting that delivers all the power and emotion of the story.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Loved the twists and turns, the depth of the plot, and his usual compulsive page turning method of telling stories!.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It had a good story line and was original but the ending was anticlimatic and left me wanting a better ending.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Lots of varriety in the boards.  Like the timer.  Visuals are crisp and clear.  Background music is not obnoxious.  Fun!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|The book is great helps in with &#34;Words with Friends&#34;. I have looked up words and punctuation to assist me with writing letters.
1932907009|5.0|My son requested this book as a gift.  He is in college for directing and heard this was a good a book.  He hasn't read it yet, so can't comment on content.  Shipped quickly with no problems.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Started out as a funny, raunchy flick, then got lame in the middle and then completely silly at the end. Too bad really, could've been a classic! Two stars....
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Fantastic.  The writers for this show are amazing.  Coming up with the story lines.  True genius!  I love the idea of a new story line from season 1.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was looking for a case for my kindle fire that didnt add much bulk, and looked professional.  This case fit well, gives great all around protection, and looks professional.  You almost feel like there isn't a case on your kindle at all! a great case!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've been trying to watch season 2 of Downton Abbey and I'm happy to say, you guys made it super easy...easier then any other site!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This is a great movie.  The music alone is worth my paying the price of admission.  The cinematographer was Douglas Slocombe, who eventually goes on to do the first three Indiana Jones movies, and the look of this film is somewhat along the lines of a Hammer film, but is richer in detail -- more than likely aided by a production design that will blow your mind.  No... it's not the funniest of movies.  No... it's not the best vampire movie.  But... you know what?  It's pretty darned funny.  And how many really good &#34;classic vampire&#34; movies can you name?<br /><br />If I were in a debate, okay... maybe &#34;objectively&#34; I'd give it four stars.  But, whatever... I love this movie.
B00004T9AS|1.0|What an utter piece of crap.  Did they sign Mike to a contract for this one with the caveat the he write cliched and uninspired pop song garbage?  How did Adrian Belew get involved with this nonsense?  If you love the albums Hergest Ridge, Ommadawn, Incantations, and inspired compositions on albums such at 5 Miles Out you will find it hard to believe this is the same artist.  Too bad Mike got involved with the Exegesis thing, it sure didn't help his composition.
0765325950|5.0|An extraordinary conclusion to the series. Love it. It's a continuous stream of awesome, emotional, dramatic scenes that will leave you breathless.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|More modern than I had hoped, but still a good story.<br />Will probably read again, and will look for others by the same author.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is the best version of Annie that I have ever seen.  My daughter will only watch this version (Carol Burnett as Mrs Hanigan) is the absolute best.
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|Nicely done, I like how she featured up in coming artist on this album and still kept it worth while. And also because amazon discounted it. Great buy!
B000031EGV|5.0|Jumanji is one of my families favorite movies.  I got this for my nephew because it's all he would watch when he was little.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|To Electric Ladyland? If not, buy this album! You're probably already a fan, if you're looking at this page, So way not buy one of Jimmi's best albums? And you really need to get it on vinyl, it's just a whole different experience.
B000083E79|5.0|Young or old Cher is definitely a favorite of all ages.  At a neighborhood cookie exchange there was a CD playing that had  Cher on it.  My daughter actually said she had been wanting to hear some Cher lately....so naturally I got this for her.
B000RFPORM|3.0|The storyline is ok-ok. The picture and filming in the location is classic and prioritizing to watch for the entertainment.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love it. It's user friendly tons of levels. I love how big the tiles are it makes it much easy to see the matches.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|If you have ever wished for time to stand still,or to move a bit more rapidly then this book is for you. Albom brings new  meaning to the value of seconds, hours, days, and every lifetime.  One of the best books of all time.
B009T8XBBO|1.0|I was looking forward to playing this game, but I never could get it to load.  After entering my name, it would crash every time.  Sending a complaint report got me nowhere, and even though it was only $.99, I don't like spending money on something I can't use.  A refund or a working game would be much appreciated.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Good acting, especially if you like Meryl Streep or Tommy Lee Jones..  Story geared to 50+ demographic. Pretty good overall.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Best weather app yet. Pay the money and get this app. You will not be disappointed. This is my go to app for weather.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I had missed some of the weekly shows due to family emergency.  I enjoyed watching all of the shows, even the ones that I had previously seen. Great product.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|My 10 year old got mad every time my 8 year old took too long to build something. He got mad when my 8 year old couldn't find the right pieces to make the right shape. Like a piramid. How the heck you build that? There are no triangles. There isn't even enough pieces to build what you want. Like an elephant he got. There was not enough grey pieces to build the elephant so he used different colors and no one had any idea what it was cause of the colors.<br />I the parent got mad cause my kids would pick up a card and be like \\"I can't build that\\" and put it back and chose another card. This went on many times. I was like \\"pick something already\\".<br />They even rolled and was like \\"I can't build anything in that category so i'm rolling the dice again\\"<br />My kids argued back and fourth telling each other that they were poor builders.<br />If this game had more pieces with more shapes and colors maybe they would have loved it.<br />Like a giraffe that I had to build. There was not enough tall pieces to make it stand up so they had no idea what the heck I was building.<br /><br />This game just made us all bored, angry, impatiant, couldn't wait for it to be over.<br /><br />My 8 year old kept leaving to watch tv while we would be in the middle of building something cause we took too long and I would have to tell him to come back here and play the game.<br /><br />Well we finished the game and I am sure we wont be playing again.<br />As for now they are using the game as a free for all and are just using it to build what ever they want without playing the game.
034580404X|4.0|I'm giving it four stars because I personally really enjoyed the series generally speaking, but you have to take that with a grain of salt considering that I had very very low expectation when I started. E.L. James is not a brilliant writer (though I do think she one-ups Stephanie Meyers by ions) but she approaches the topic of BDSM flawlessly for readers like myself who have never seen, read, or even considered the topic before. It's a very entertaining story if you keep an open mind about the writing and story line. Also might keep in mind that it speaks volumes about the female psyche considering how widely popular this book is--I have several male friends who felt it warranted reading just based on that alone.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|\\"A Quest of Heroes\\" follows a young man, Thorgrin, on his dream to become part of the Legion, a specially trained battalion that is under the King's command. Thorgrin finds out that he is different from other people by having a power inside of him; however, he does not know the limits of this new found power of where it even comes from. This is a book of fantasy, heart break, and adventure. While it may not be very long, it is an excellent story that will make you want more!
030758836X|3.0|For starters, I predicted the first half of the book nearly point for point because it read exactly like a primetime police/criminology show. I also did not feel Gillian Flynn is particularly talented author, she may be an entertaining or creative writer perhaps, but I felt the novel was a clear demonstration that &#34;New York Times Bestseller&#34; does not an author make. That said, Gone Girl is a fairly entertaining and a riveting plot line for most readers. I also do believe she does a fairly great job at creating compelling characters, making Nick every bit as pitiable as he is pathetic and Amy every bit as admirably sharp as she is despicably cerebral. If you're looking for a quick read--then I certainly recommend this as it's not the worst thing I've read, but don't expect any big surprises from the writing.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This thing is so much fun!!<br /><br />This is the perfect gift for the geeky person that has everything else already.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is also sort of a mystery.  The book held my interest. There was variety among the characters and I did not find any dry or boring areas.
B005FVNIW6|3.0|I was recommended this as the best book someone had ever read. It didn't live up to that expectation but was an entertaining read.
0385333846|5.0|I knew that you would read this review. It is inevitable. The moment is just structured that way. It is happening, always has happened, and always will happen. The Tralfamadorians taught me that.<br /><br />And since this is the case, it is probably also inevitable that you are tentatively considering buying this book (which's name and description appears above for your convenience). At least, I sincerely HOPE you are considering, as I can honestly say from experience that buying this novel is totally worth the mere dollars that Amazon has generously decided to offer it for. Of course, this book is not for everybody, and it definitely contains what many consider downfalls. Without any frame of reference, if you are expecting a specific kind of majesty from this, you may well miss out on another.<br /><br />Therefore let me give you a little idea of what to expect.<br /><br />Now, Vonnegut was not attempting to write this book as any sort of captivating sequential plot. In fact, every few pages the narration does a time jump to a completely different scene with all new characters unique to it. Therefore there is barely any conflict, tension, or any kind of real blood- pumping climax whatsoever. But don't let that deter you! This novel's brilliance lies within its other aspects, of tone, humor, and content. If you are able to open your mind to the possibilities and fun of its non- conventional approach, you will without a doubt find this novel incredibly rewarding.<br /><br />Kurt's blackly satirical voice is similar to that of Mark Twain in this book, though I find that Vonnegut's is juicier with its variety of bizarre, modern approaches. Unlike Twain he is not bound by the traditionalism of the nineteenth century. The comedy in this book will not only enthrall you, but will reach you on a more than personal level, as it delves into the very core of human life in a way undeniable in its poignancy. All the while, consistent running jokes and literary tactics will keepyou laughing the whole way. Of course, there are definitely those moments of horror which, told in the same detached, casual tone as the jokes, will be even more impacting (it is a war book, after all). In fact, sometimes in this book, the line between comedic satire and dark commentary is blurred, making it all the more powerful.<br /><br />And then of course there is the Sci-fi element. While not always present, it is unavoidable, and therefore should be taken for what it is. If you are a fan of Sci-fi, especially psychological Sci-fi, then this is just one extra little treat for you. If you happen to find it completely uninviting, you may want to reconsider this book, though it shouldn't be too hard to look past it, especially in the way it is presented. In fact, this book never fails to find more and more interesting ways to present its themes. It is truly the epitome of experimental fiction.<br /><br />... Or should I call it \\"non- fiction\\"? It is, of course, a book based on Vonnegut's own experiences in WWII, and therefore does not lose content over flair. In fact, most of the time, the experimental touch actually succeeds beautifully in portraying Vonnegut's messages. In the end, we are left with a sense of fulfillment, awareness, and speculation, as we contemplate the meaning of death and hurt in our own lives, and find a new desire to appreciate the inevitable happy moments mixed up in there. But I'll let you experience that for yourself. Good luck!

B00A3CVFMM|4.0|Four big stars because it contained some new stuff that was amazing. Especially the Dwarves' chanting motif carried through several tracks. Beautiful.<br /><br />ONLY four stars because there were a lot of recycled themes. One does not simply replay LOtR over and over and over and over. One gets tired, and simply turns it off before one has a nervous breakdown and yells at the kids for something stupid.<br /><br />But, I knew that before I purchased it, and I still thought it was worth it for the new stuff. I wish they would have put the new stuff on cd #1, and the old stuff on cd #2, or better yet, just sold this hypothetical cd #1 by itself. But one does not make money this way.

0765325950|1.0|I will be downloading this book as a PDF torrent as soon as it hits the torrent sites, due to delaying the ebook release.  Even though I've bought all of the previous books of the series, when they were available for free on torrent sites, I will be voting with (the lack of) my wallet this time.  Whomever made the decision to delay release of the ebook; get with the program!  Have you learned nothing from the music industry's fights with its archaic business practices??

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Wonderful game. But at the end of the story it said to be continued? Why? Maybe there another one? I don't know? Try this game. It might be hard, but try it. You also have to pay this game during the middle of the game. So be careful. It will cost 1.00 Please try the game. Have fun.
B00AEFY552|5.0|Just recieved the 2013 re-issue, i think. there are 2 disc in the set instead of the listed 4 disc. is this a typo? also, can anyone tell me if i got a new reissue,  because the disc look exactly like the disc from the previous gladiator sapphire issue?
B0049J0DC8|3.0|This was such a big hit when it first came out and I loved it.  Then I got older and had kids.  We just watched it with my five year old son and it was not good.  The story line with the vicious neighbor boy (spoiler alert?) was really disturbing.  His mutilated toys were frightening and he creeped us all out.  Especially in this day and age, his love of blowing things up seems like a horrible element to have in a kid's movie.  I don't understand why the makers of this series include such a dark streak in each story line.  I wish I hadn't shown it to my son.  Other than that, there was some funny stuff but the way the other toys treat Woody when they think he &#34;killed&#34; Buzz is harsh too - they abandon him to that kid who mutilates toys.  There is also a bit of sexuality in the way Bo Peep tries to seduce Woody.  And frankly, there are NO other female characters in this one.  It's hard to believe, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun and when you get to higher levels it gets real challenging. The bridge is good to have on this one
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story. Believable characters and situations. Perfect casting of all the characters.. The Brits seem to have gotten this one right!
6305165912|3.0|This movie is just 'so so'. Its not great at all.I can't understand all the hype about this convoluted, silly, borderline boring- movie. I don't get it. Maybe if you are 'on' something while watching this dumb flick, its great. But not watching it sober; its not great in any way whatsoever.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|What an amazing adventure into a complicated life. It was very eye-opening and afforded me an opportunity to get to know a technology super-hero. I thought it was exceptionally well written. I think anyone with an interest in Steve Jobs and a history on the creation of Apple should read this!
B0063IH60K|1.0|First time I tried to play it wouldn't let me play unless I clicked on an ad for a dating website. Uninstalled. I don't have an issue with ad-supported apps but give me an option to close/skip past the ad after a few seconds.
B003L7DK6U|5.0|I first seen this movie back when laser discs were the hot ticket item, and have been a Bruce Lee fan ever since.  I'd have to say that the clarity from the blu-ray is better than I had expected.  Unable to rate the audio at this time due to the lack of a home theater system, but sounds pretty good thru my Turtle Beach gaming headset played from my PS3.  The front of the case had a hole in it which I was disappointed about being that it was brand new.  The disc was in excellent condition though so not a big deal.  Overall, great product and I'd recommend this movie to any martial arts fan.
0765325950|5.0|What can be said about the conclusion to a series 23 years in the making, with millions upon millions of words? A world of epic proportions has been woven, and the Dark One threatens to unweave it in the enthralling conclusion to the Wheel of Time.<br /><br />I stayed up until 4 AM to finish it - and I was exhilarated and exhausted at the same time. What Sanderson began in The Gathering Storm comes to a rocketing, rolling conclusion as the legacy of Jordan is truly honored. What are you waiting for!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book loved it. Did not see the ending comming very eerie surprise but good surprise. Can't wait to see the movie!!

B005LAII80|5.0|[[ASIN:B005LAII80 Dredd [3D Blu-ray + Digital Copy + UltraViolet]]][[ASIN:B009YQJ322 Dredd [DVD + Digital Copy]]][[ASIN:B00ARF92HK Dredd]]<br />After the horror of the Stallone version (despite a few high points), I had little hopes for this new release.<br /><br />This is one of those times that I am thrilled to be wrong...<br /><br />The movie was much more faithful to the character of Judge Dredd, even if it was a slightly different take on the world of Dredd itself.  It didn't have quite the comicy feel of Megacity (something that the Stallone movie did actually do pretty well), but it did feel like a more realistic version of the Dredd universe.  I was also amazed at how gritty it was... you thought the new Batman took a darker/grittier approach?  Nothing compared to Dredd.<br /><br />It is not one of the major story arcs (at least not one I read in the progs/comics), but more of a day in the life of Dredd.  Just a simple day of testing out a rookie, and seeing if she has what it takes to really be a Judge.  Of course, things rapidly spiral and escalate out of control, and then Dredd does what Dredd does best - he plows through every obstacle with a single minded determination to reach his goal.<br /><br />The cinematography was superb, some really beautiful effect - especially the scenes when perps are using the slo-mo drug.  The sound really immersed you in the film - to the point that I quite literally jumped when I heard one of the gunshots from a rear speaker.<br /><br />All of the actors do a fantastic job in their roles, with Urban, Headey and Thirlby being the stand outs (as they should be).<br /><br />The special features on the Blu-ray are nothing spectacular.  There is a pretty good '35 years of Dredd' clip that is well worth the price of admission.  The video prequel comic is ok, but too short.  There are several other short featurettes that are worth watching, but nothing stand out.<br /><br />Really wish there were some deleted scenes, or a commentary, or maybe a few progs digitized for my wide screen nostalgic reading pleasure.  Maybe we'll see that in a special collectors edition that comes with a prop lawgiver.....<br /><br />It is sad that the marketing campaign for this movie wasn't better here in the states - or that the word was so slow in getting it.  It seemed to be out of theaters even before most people heard it was released.<br /><br />With any luck, the Bluray/DVD sales will be enough to generate interest in a sequel... Dark Judges?  Judge Cal?  Who knows.  One thing I do know, is if they stick with the creative team on this film, and Urban/Thirlby, it will be fantastic!

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have had this case for over a year and absolutely LOVE it!  This is honestly the best case I have ever had and it has certainly save my phone on many occasions. I have had glasses of water accidentally spilled all over my phone at least a couple of times by my kids, with no problem. It has fallen into puddles when rushing. I have dropped this thing so many times that I could not even begin to count. I'm talking big drops. I feel so much safer having this case. It is also very slim for such a protective case, much less bulky than the otterbox. The screen is very clear and has stayed that way. The touch screen works exactly the same with the case as as it did with no case. It really is amazing! I get compliments on the look of it too. I was so shocked to see that there were any negative reviews on this case. For all of the scrapes and falls this case has taken, it still looks pretty good.<br />I highly recommend the lifeproof case to anyone; you would not regret it!
0670019933|5.0|I loved \\"On The Road\\" but this is the book that I recommend if someone wants to read only one Jack Kerouac novel. What made the reading of this book extra special for me was that while I was reading about Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder and Henry Morley climbing a California mountain, I was camped out 12,000 feet up on a California mountain on a very cold, early spring night reading this book in my sleeping bag inside my tent by lamplight. It was glorious because I could really imagine I was on that mountain with Ray and Japhy. The one slight quibble I've also had with the story is when Ray has the questionable insight that \\"you can't fall off a mountain\\". Oh yes you can; people die from it every year.<br /><br />\\"On The Road\\" will soon be released as a movie,and I hope it's a big success so that someone decides to make \\"Dharma Bums\\" into a film.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I think the performance of the music on this DVD is much better than the new Les Miserables movie.  If you want drama with ok music performance, get the movie.  If you want terrific musical talent get the 25th Anniversary in Concert performance.

B008QCBFHG|5.0|Of the major delights of the releases of complete opera recordings in recent months ALESSANDRO, written by Handel in 1726, is the pick of the crop. That it is not performed or recorded more frequently is likely due to the demands of the musical writing for the singers: this Handel opera has more difficult arias and recitatives, flights of ornamentation, and extended passages of passionate yet florid singing that almost any of his operas.  And that is precisely what makes this recording from Decca so special: it fulfills all of Handel's demands with some of the finest voices specializing in Baroque opera today.<br /><br />The three-hour opera has a rather brief synopsis: Alessandro (Alexander the Great) comes to believe that he is the son of the god Jupiter. His delusion is such that he demands to be worshipped as a god. His Macedonian captains conspire to cure him of this belief, but their efforts are weak. During the course of the work, Roxana and Lisaura are rivals for the affection of Alessandro.<br /><br />George Petrou conducts the Armonia Atenea and the cast is as follows: the staggeringly brilliant Croatian countertenor Max Emanuel Cenčić is phenomenal as Alesandro, Canadian soprano Karina Gauvin is Lisaura and Russian soprano Julia Lezhneva is her rival Roxana, Catalonian countertenor Xavier Sabata is Tassile, Spanish tenor Juan Sancho is Leonato, Korean bass In-Sung Kim is Clito, and Russian countertenor Vasily Khorshev is Cleone.<br /><br />Cenčić alone is reason to pay attention to both this opera and to his spectacular singing  of the title role. His voice appears to have no breaks and the gleaming quality of his tone is the finest of his recorded career to date.  Gauvin is, as always, luminous in her delivery of all the technical and emotional challenges of her role.  Julia Lezhneva is a young singer with enormous promise though her voice at this point is a bit light. Juan Sancho proves he is a tenor to watch. The entire cast more than meets the demands of this glorious opera and hearing the work repeatedly as it is performed here under the stylish conducting of George Petrou makes us hope that opera companies will add this splendid work to their repertoires. On every level this is a highly successful recording.  Grady Harp, January 13ands of this glorious opera and hearing the work repeatedly as it is performed here under the stylish conducting of George Petrou makes us hope that opera companies will add this splendid work to their repertoires.

B00867GJYK|4.0|There is no doubt that the Bluray version of Finding Nemo is outstanding in regards to video and audio quality.  The extras are ok but not out of this world.  However I am giving this disk a 4 star review simply for the fact that Pixar and Disney waited so long to release it.  Wehave seen the standard def version so many times that by the time this arrived it was less enjoyable.<br /><br />Having said that, this version is of outstanding quality and would make a great gift for any Pixar fan.

Way to support Brandon and this awesome endeavor guys.  Way to wait 20 years for a book and then blow up because the E version is a little behind.  And to top it off, when you do read it, and you can't believe how awesome it was, will you go back and adjust your score?  No, because you're not that smart.  If you were, you would not have scored it 1 star to begin with.

B000U0F7RG|3.0|Overall I like this box set. I love this show and love watching it. However, I was sad to find out that season 7 has some glitchy DVDs that still play but have flashy parts and other weirdness. Another downside was that disc 24 (disc 6 of season 4) didn't play, at all. I had to get a replacement disc from Ebay and it was 6 dollars. The set is nice, but I think it is horrid that the discs would have any problems with them. I didn't purchase this item from Amazon, but I thought that others might want to know before they buy. The set is cool, but glitchy discs are annoying. If you have the separate seasons, just keep those.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading the Wool series based-on a friend's recommendation and couldn't stop reading after the first book (short story).  The story is rich with characters and details- so much that I could visualize what every scene looked like.  I won't go into details of the story and spoil it for those who haven't read this yes, but if you haven't read this, I highly-highly-highly suggest that you do!

B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case is a welcome new home for my new Kindle Fire HD. It's a stylish black, soft leatherette with an elastic strap to keep it closed. I had to press rather hard on the corners of my Kindle to get it to snap into place in its plastic bracket, but once secured, there's no danger of it falling out. It's by no means a flimsy case, either - it has a little \\"heft\\" to it and feels like it really will help protect my tablet.  The adjustable stand will come in very handy for viewing movies or videos, or just as a hands-free alternative to holding it for reading or playing games. I haven't figured out yet how the \\"sleep/wake lid\\" works, but I'm sure I will eventually. I think I'll be very pleased with this product.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is an amazingly special CD - Paul McCartney sings the old standards beautifully. Diana Krall's arranging is superb as are the musicians that join Paul on the different songs.  Would love him to do another.  Can't pick a favourite - they are all great!

0765325950|1.0|I have bought the hardcover book.  I have all the books and have bought every one on the first day. But why do you show such contempt for us by denying us the Ebook NOW?  I will not read the book until I can read it on my IPad. Your disrespect is a bitter disappointment after 23 years of loyalty. God Bless George R. R. Martin. He may take forever to write a sequel but he lets us buy any format on day one. That is respect for the fan.  The author's widow made this decision and I resent it deeply.

030746363X|4.0|Laize-faire, throw caution to the wind revolution against health status quo.<br /><br />This is the best book I've ever read. It seems sad to say that but it was exactly the sort of thing I like.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are revelations. But it's experimental and cutting edge - it's not a handbook, a guidebook or a handbook - and that's why it works so well. It's true progress.<br /><br />A base of understanding will put you in good stead before you start. If you're the typical idiot and don't heed the warnings the knowledge can do you damage. I like that.<br /><br />This is true science because it is hands on. There are no journal subscriptions or lecturers here.<br /><br />So why not 5 stars?<br />Well, this is a massively popular book and I think it has gone beyond it's remit. Time for the findings from the book to be peer reviewed and reformatted for such mass general consumption.<br />Not that I'm in favour of dumbing down - this is the most refreshing thing about the book and the attitude of people like Tim who continue to make progress in such studies, whatever field you are in.<br /><br />The other thing is that, there are so much more possibilities not touched on. The book is just a glimpse into the way things could be so in a sense it doesn't go far enough - no molecular level stuff I suppose. This is ultra harsh to not give 5 stars but for me 5 stars is perfection rather than >80%
0385341008|5.0|I have read and loved this book immensely.  It has been lent to others continuously since I finished it and EVERYONE has enjoyed it as much as I did.
B005F3XV62|5.0|It's nice when a movie can be viewed by Mom and children from age 16 to 10. After renting this one, we couldn't wait to add it to our collection at home.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I learned so much more about WW1 reading this book.. It was a painless way to learn some history<br />And I can't wait to jump into book 2.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I rate this five stars because this most recent album of Jason Mraz has twelve great songs good to listen to.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|My husband likes movies where things get blown up and there is lots of action  This fits the bill. I enjoyed the subtle humor.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|In season 2 they continued the thrill ride of fairytale inspired deadly situations.  Hope they continue for many seasons to come.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Yes the same game that you played on your PC/Lap  Top.  First solitaire game we all played is here now for your tablet and I love it just like the old game.  It is a great way to kill time.  I recommend this game and if you played in the past you already know why.  Now get!!
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|My 9 year old LOVES Halo, and loves legos and mega bloks now. We've been doing a lot of the Halo sets, and I happened to see after Xmas that they had a bunch of them 40 to 60 percent off, so I grabbed a dozen different ones.<br /><br />As with all the megablok Halo sets, it's done very well and looks great. I used to dislike the way things were packaged, unlike Lego kits that have bags numbered and used for specific parts of the build... But I found that ultimately I like the lack of organization since now I've showed my 9 year old how to get all the bags open and start sorting out all the parts into piles so everything is organized and easy to find. I think that, for me, is now a bonus since he's getting really good at sorting things, analyzing different parts that have something in common (such as angled pieces of different sizes and shapes going in separate piles but all together so when he needs some angled piece, he knows what part of the floor to look for) and planning how to space them out so the ones he has to get the most often are within arms reach. That to me was like a lightbulb going off, since I was able to turn the negative into a great teaching tool. Especially with the large sets like the Elephant (almost 1300 pieces to sort and organize) and the new Forward Unto Dawn we have (that is almost 2900 pieces).<br /><br />For a 9 year old, having the colored dots showing exactly where each piece fits is great. It helps for the larger sets since it makes it easy to get each section done. He starts out intimidated by the sheer number of pieces, but as he starts he just focuses on a step at a time and has learned that large things are comprised of smaller things, and that if you take big things in small sections, it's not so overwhelming. Always an important lesson for kids to learn.<br /><br />No missing pieces in our set - but they have a great automated system online where you don't even have to talk to anyone to get the piece shipped out, so it couldn't be any easier to get any missing pieces. Everything fit fine - which is something I've had issue with Mega Bloks a few times, where the raised bumps weren't quite formed right and I had to pull out a knife and trim a bit for a piece to snap right.<br /><br />All in all was a steal for my sale price, and we're very happy with this kit. It looks awesome, and he really enjoys playing with it.be any easier to get any missing pieces.

0765325950|5.0|I haven't even gotten my copy yet, but since it seems no one else has, at least I can balance things out.<br /><br />Apparently all these so called fans who are disgruntled about the lack of ebook do not remember that this same thing occurred the with the last release.  If memory serves, this was a decision by Robert Jordan's widow for which Brandon Sanderson, to his credit, apologized profusely for.  Sanderson has done such an excellent job with staying true to this series that it pains me to see all these hacks denigrate the book because they decided to throw the 21st century equivalent of a temper tantrum.<br /><br />If you want to complain about something, head over to one George RR Martin's books and give it a low grade.  At least it will be a bit more warranted since he rarely writes any more and has clearly fired his editor.
0802473156|5.0|A lot of ideas in this book just make sense once you really think about it.  BUT so often we need a simple, basic book like this to show us patterns in our lives.  Once we SEE the patterns, NOW we can do something about them.<br />GREAT book.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Was just as expected a great movie . I would recommend this movie to more ppl. Love everything about it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I have had lots of comments on this case. I love that it is not big and bulky like some cases and it fits my Kindle perfectly. The stand could be a bit more sturdy but for the few times I use it the stand works just fine.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I played in the past and thought it would bring back a memory of good times I had playing.  After downloading and trying I was disappointed with the game play and chose to remove it.  This s just me and it may be what will work for you.  Give it a try and if it works for you great, if not you can always remove it as I did.  Your call on this one.
0545265355|5.0|Everyone loves these books for a reason, they are great. The movie is good too! Can't wait for the rest of the movies.
B0037UUZQY|5.0|My granddaughter got this as Christmas present and she thinks it is great. It has held up well. I would recommend this for any little girl.
B005M5NDCA|5.0|Man, Scotty's voice is amazing.  I love to listen to him sing.  I enjoy the lyrics and that some of his songs are about life, love and family are just a total bonus.<br />Let's support this young artist!!!!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Was a great movie was thrilling and exciting all in one. Would totally recommend this movie to other ppl. Great movie to watch.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|This is the kind of beautiful movie that I come across every once in a while that keeps my watching movies. Most films are about misery, fast driving and explosions. This one's about life.

B00756GRUE|5.0|Beautiful watch...have to see it in person to appreciate!! Love the 200m water resistance, the chronograph, the rotating bezel, and most importantly...its SOLAR, meaning no more batteries to change! Love it!!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|This fits a fair amount of Barbie things.  The dimensions (posted above) work well with about 8 barbies and all the billions of little itty bitty things that come with those 8 Barbies.  The zippers are sturdy and easy to zip up and down but do not slide down on their own.<br />The only teeny thing I would change is the structure or the firmness of the sides and top come from that heavy duty chipboard which is then fully and nicely encased in the plastic that you gives you that pretty pictures on the in and out sides of the box.  I did have to remind my 6-yr old that she cannot sit or stand on this as it will crease.  (The box *seems* sturdy enough that one might be tempted to use it a seat.)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great to pass the time,  similar concept to.the other games out there, but I enjoy it. Had an issue initially. with the $ production time from the stands &amp; habitats but I just re-installed it.
B000069AUH|2.0|The three stars is not for the music itself.  That's a five star.<br /><br />It's for the pressing quality of the vinyl.  This album has a HUGE amount of background noise, pops and hiss, and has a muffled sound.<br /><br />I've sent it through my Spin Clean several times and it helped the noise a bit, but still a lot of noise on this album.<br /><br />I'm going to send this to a friend to have it cleaned better (VPI system) to see if that helps at all.  But a brand new &#34;Limited Edition&#34; album should not be this poor fresh out of the sleeve...<br /><br />For the music itself, it's fantastic.  A solid start to finish album.  The music will bring you through just about every emotion throughout the playlist.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I got it for my brother, he loved it, jim Carey is almost syco, but funny, its a great one you could watch every year.
B00003CXAT|1.0|I got this movie for my husband for Xmas cause he had been searching for it for months got the movie it has the right box and and right inserts but it was not the right movie it was the 2nd Jurassic park :(

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a very addictive and challenging game with a great soundtrack. You definitely have to play this with headphones to immerse yourself in the game.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|This product is exactly as advertised.  This product showed up on time and as advertised. I would recommend this product.

B0033TJATW|5.0|I loved Michael and this was a movie feature my son was raised with also. We had the VHS and almost wore it out when he was little!
B001EVNMTK|4.0|These were what we needed for this razor. They don't seem to last very long but that isn't the vendor it is the brand I have decided.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Great game keeps one interested and wanting more. Each level is challenging and graphics are great and creative. Keep up with the good work.
B005F3XV62|4.0|This movie is silly and fun.  It is very enjoyable.  It is good for kids up to seniors like me.
B00932A6G4|2.0|didn't expect much, was still disappointed. Dialog written by 14yr old call of duty players. Japanese style anime exposition with western cheese, managed to get the worst of both worlds.
B008Z9L94O|1.0|I waited long for this masterpiece and was very happy to get it via Amazon USA for half the price I would have to pay here in Germany. All in all, these were pretty much the good points. I have the same problem as all the other bad reviews, distortion and sound artifacts (best noticeable on \\"Zero\\"). I think that Amazon makes it even worse by mixing the reviews for the CD reissue with the Vinyl reissue as the problem seems to occur just on the Vinyl version. If you combine the Vinyl reviews, this reissue wont even get near a 2-Star rating. I am thinking of returning my 2 copys of this wonderfull album / s***ty reissue.
B0098460O4|5.0|QUALITY SINGING DUET BY TWO VERY TALENTED AND YOUNG OPERA STARS!!!!!  I GO TO SLEEP WITH THIS CD EVERY NIGHT, NEVER MIND PLAING IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY!!  SO GLAD I GOT IT.
B003KJF2WE|5.0|Great story and I loved the way the last five minutes of the movie was the perfect lead-in to The Avengers.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Not the kind of game I normally play, but am so glad I tried it!  Now, if it just came with someone to do my laundry, cook dinner, etc.....
0684859106|5.0|Great cakes and one does not need a degree from the CIA to make cakes that everyone wants to eat.
B000001ELP|4.0|Music From The Elder isn't a groundbreaking classic like \\"Destroyer\\" but it's a good comeback after their commercial disaster, Unmasked. I personally disliked it but they take a mature direction here and it's a more serious album rather than a typical hair/glam band. The songs are more progressive and melodic, nothing real heavy but it's not too poppy either. Overall, not a very accessible album like their early stuff but it gets better with age. It's good to hear something different and to know that Kiss aren't going to make every album sound the same album over and over. Fans that called it boring or disappointing have a bland taste in music and should be more open-minded.
B001FB5634|5.0|DVD was excellent, if depressing.  why would the producers release it near Christmas, 2009? Very downbeat for that time of year.<br />DVD arrived in time and was in excellent condition.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great Story. Not what I expected.  A love story, which was surprising considering that reviews that i have read and heard.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I've had this game and played it for about a month.  I uninstalled it today because of the invasive ads.  I really like this version of Solitaire and was okay with an ad every game.  After I played a certain amount of game, the ads dropped off.  However, today I started getting the video ads.  I might have been able to handle these IF the app had provided a \\"Skip\\" button - hitting the back button didn't always work.  I might spring for a paid version if one comes out with no ads.  Until then, adios!
