B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I loved the John Carter of Mars books by Edgar Rice Burroughs.  I think this a great adaptation of the first three book to a movie.
B008OJ291W|4.0|The reviews for this album on these pages offer more of a debate than an actual review, especially those posted - like this one, on the day of release (10/9/12) - how many have even listened to it yet???.  I'm still awaiting my own copy to be delivered but was forced into rating it as well, but decided on not going the route of 1 star.  Like most of the others here, I too have been a long time fan, and admit when I discovered that this release was forthcoming, that it seemed an odd choice for Jeff from a fan's standpoint.  To truly gain more insight on Jeff's point seek out the Mr. Blue Sky documentary currently being aired.  As far as the idea that it was a way to garner more royalties over the former members doesn't cut it for me.  They have been touring as a tribute band and performing (and selling) music of Jeff's for well over 20 years now.  What difference does it really make?  We can always play the old albums and the great thing about buying music...is that we don't have to buy it if we don't want to...  Take this release for what it is.  Based on the track previews it seems a faithful reproduction of hits for the digital age.  I will listen out of curiosity...and to play \\"spot the differences\\".  It will probably stay in my car and may make my iPod, but I'll decide on that after I actually hear it...  I apologize that this isn't a true review either, but another opinion on the debate.  For an actual review it would probably be best to check these pages out in the coming weeks and months...

B000063DI9|4.0|For many, \\"7th Son\\" heralded in the end of the classic version of Iron Maiden, which saw the band's fortunes begin to somewhat decline in the album's wake.  The band reached it's commercial peak in the U.K. with this one, scoring several radio hits from the album, and it was also very popular on the U.S. side of the pond.  The album is a concept piece revolving around a myth of the 7th son having special mystical powers (or something like that).  The music is classic Maiden mixing scorching twin guitar lead metal with elements of progressive rock.  Keyboards are also introduced to the mix on this one, although used mainly in the background.  Up until this point Maiden had taken many of it lyrical themes from movies, books, and TV shows.  On this one, they come up with an original concept that for the most parts works as a cohesive story.  Some of Maiden's all time classic songs are to be found here including \\"Can I Play With Madness\\", \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", the title track, and one of my all time favorites \\"The Clairvoyant\\".  For me the album gets off to a bit of a slow start however, with \\"Moonchild\\" and \\"Infinite Dreams\\" not doing a lot for me.  I would also say that I am disappointed with the \\"remastering\\" of the disc.  The whole thing sounds rather muddy.  I had this on vinyl back in the day and I remembering it sounding a lot better.  Overall \\"Seventh Son\\" is classic Iron Maiden and probably a disc well worth owning.  I don't think it is the band's best (as some do), but it is a solid piece of mid-80's conceptual prog metal.
B003LWXQ1O|5.0|Although I have heard the original album no less than 350 billion times (this year alone...  ha ha), having the opportunity to hear the band's progression from simple rehearsals, to instrumental demos, to vocal guide demos, to live concert truly entertained me.  I also, thoroughly enjoyed the instrumental alternate versions that came in the set.<br /><br />If purchased as CD's this set occupied three discs and contained, I believe, a total of 44 songs.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you like The Cure and want a solid addition to your collection of their music, I highly recommend this version of their hit album Disintegration.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book! Reminds me of 50 shades but not as kinky. Liked how they met and the roommate he was such a perfect character.
1401322786|4.0|This novel has the most interesting synopsis I've read in a very long time. It's attention grabbing, imaginative, and mysterious. It almost built up my expectation of the book too much, and thus the book did disappoint a bit. The first issue I have is the format. It definitely is up to individual taste, but I personally don't like the way in which each story is set up with a parallel structure to the other stories, and the format of the bold type sentences. The purpose was probably to add consistency and flow, but it made it very repetitive to read. And my other major bone to pick is it reads almost like a fable, with a very obviously stated moral at the end. The lesson should've been up to the reader to discern, rather than pushing it in our faces. Too much attention was paid to make sure we learned our lesson at the end, and not enough character development of the Time Keeper, in my opinion. However, I would definitely recommend people read it, and judge for themselves. Overall, it was a good book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really love this app!  it is really good and useful and helpful on how much u can use the web and stuff like that! :) &lt;3!!!!!!
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Dealing with web designers and company owners can be a real problem because of their warped view of what creating a webpage means. Being an IT consultant, many of the purely technical arguments become nonsense to them, whereas debunking theirs becomes counterproductive. This book can be read by anyone who's involved in web design and deployment, to get a feel of the real issues faced by the end user, in a clear and practical way.<br /><br />I particularly like the self-assessment examples: they baffle designers and CEOs by showing how wrong are the models that they typically come up with, but also explain how to fix that and change their mindset. I also love the sample e-mails intended to persuade designers and CEOs on their bad ideas (\\"Help! My boss wants me to...\\").
B003RUZKC8|5.0|Lots of fun to view,lots of action ,with twist and turns.I got a great price from Amazon ,so you can`t go wrong with this movie.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|It's amazing to me that, after 40 years, these guys can still come up with something fresh and new like this latest work. At first listen I was a little confused, not what I was expecting. But, that's Rush. They are known for not standing still or resting on their laurels. Jazz, classical and even country musicians have been allowed long careers to develop, evolve and innovate and now Rush stands among the elder statesmen of rock. I can't wait to see what they will come up with next. BTW, as good as this album is, it's even better live. I saw them in St. Louis on the Clockwork tour and... words fail me.
B001EBWITA|5.0|excellent story and the movie tells it well. the special effects are an asset to the story and don't overshadow it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Shooting the projectiles is a lot like Angry Birds, but is more believable.  I have not made it through all levels yet, but look forward to doing so.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This novel has all the twists and turns and action and surprises we expect in a Reacher story. I didn't want to put it down.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I am not a chili peppers hard core fan by any means, just a guy who grew up in the 90s from first experiencing under the bridge on MTV and from then on enjoyed all the RHCP albums.  After reading Scar Tissue I am now an even bigger fan.  The book reads very well.... I could not put it down, I was so intrigued by all the craziness of Anthony's life.  He's a good dude, he was on some hard times with addiction and this book addresses how he kicked his habit, some of his past lovers, stories of his childhood and how the RHCP formed and became popular.  The chapters start from day one of when Anthony was born to present (2004) and reads like a long story.<br /><br />After reading, I am just so happy for Anthony and how is life turned out, I could really identify with the language and the flow of the book. Excellent job in writing AR and \\"Ratso\\" would love to chat with these guys one day about it, I have so many more questions and insights.
0316228532|5.0|Obviously, after seven Harry Potter books, JK Rowling was basically all set as far as her checkbook was concerned...but while I certainly enjoyed those books even as an adult, there's always the question of \\"is this all there is?\\" As though those stories weren't enough, since they were \\"fantasy.\\"<br /><br />Years ago, Stephen King answered his own critics with \\"Different Seasons,\\" a collection of novellas that included \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\\" It was his first foray into \\"literary\\" fiction, just like \\"Vacancy\\" is for Rowling.<br /><br />Like King, Rowling also pulled it off. This is an excellent example of legitimate storytelling, and it is absolutely impressive how well she juggles a huge cast, dozens of plots and subplots, and pulls it all together for a heartbreak of a conclusion. Yes, there's a bit of melodrama at the end, but for at least 90 percent of the conclusion, it's played straight, even when events are spiraling out of control for many members of the cast.<br /><br />Characters shift from sympathetic to villains and back and forth. I did have issues following who was who in the early going, but by the book's back half it all made sense. I'm most impressed with how tight the book feels - even though its 500+ pages. Stephen King's more recent books, for example, feel very under-edited, but that's not the case here. There were no examples of digressions or tangents that didn't factor into the larger story in some important way.<br /><br />There's sex and swearing, but it reads honestly and is hardly anything special. This is an adult-themed novel to be sure, but I think that Potter fans who are graduating to more mature books would find this a good step forward (a comment below mentions a self-mutilation plot-line, and that's certainly a sub-topic some readers will not be interested in, which I understand. But it is real life, and various parent-child relations are presented harshly and realistically).<br /><br />It gets a little Desperate Housewives-y at times. The suburban gossip and feuds seem so petty on the page, but then of course they do - that's the point. Once past the first 100 pages or so, the various plots begin to seem less derivative. Ultimately, this is an advanced look at death and what gets left behind.<br /><br />A few characters are surprisingly redeemed, while others fall to the pressure. She puts enough red herrings out there to where I was never quite sure, and to my surprise, I didn't see the ending coming until it was obvious.<br /><br />It's very well done, and it's an exciting, careful study of both characters and a town. I almost want to see a sequel, but I think this story's told...but I certainly want to see Rowling's next effort. For me, this was the rare book that lived up to the hype.rate Housewives-y at times.

B008HK3XOU|5.0|well worth the money spent. Gives protection to the fire. Gives more to hold onto grip wise making it less likely to drop it.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I'm one of \\"those\\" people who like to read the \\"book\\" before the movie and trailers come out. Usually, the book always become quite more entertaining than the movie, but I feel that in this case, the movie will be better!  I would have to give David Mitchell a \\" Publisher's\\" award for taking a much different approach for writing  various stories in a very unique way.....you start telling a story...but only half...and another story on top of that one,  only half, and the stories keep going...with telling the first half, as in a Broadway Play, until the middle finally comes up with a story that \\"begins\\" and \\" ends.\\"  And I still don't know anymore than when I began reading...it stays a\\"puzzle\\" until it finishes the first story with Adam Ewing being nursed to health after a bout with \\"brain worms\\" and I think it is the \\"brain worms\\" that keeping living courses of their lives, instead of souls!  It has too many worms which fry the reader's brain, while not revealing key answers to key questions...how many souls are being played out in these stories?  All we know is that there is \\"one\\"....the character that keeps showing up with the unique birthmark of a comet!  It is clear that the same \\"other\\" souls are reincarnated along with the \\"comet\\" soul, and supposedly connected to each other, as each story unfolds like petals on a rose, but sometimes, there are not enough petals \\"unfolded\\" to give an accurate connection, to all the souls, especially in the stories that become the \\"second-half\\" of the book.  Confused? Well so was I!  It was entertaining, I must say, to see how somethings did shape and mold our past, present and future from this \\" quirky\\" story-telling.  It was like Fasbender told his friend Sixsmith...a half a journal is like a half love affair....and so the first half of the stories were told...and gave you enough curiosity to seek out the endings.  I would have to say that the \\" Orison of Sonmi-451\\" was my favorite and the most entertaining!  I guess because it could easily be the \\" scenario\\" that could very well \\"play out\\" in real life!  It was the only story that jumps off the pages into my artistic mind.  And that is why a gave it a \\"4\\" rating...but the book also is romantic, witty, laughable, curious, suspenseful , and colorful...along with a feeling of \\"metallic\\" and \\"gray\\" weaves in and out of some of the stories, giving the reader a sense of beauty and darkness within one sentence.  It was a very \\"clever\\" piece of literature, I must conclude.
B00004WGAK|5.0|This is the widescreen format and it fits my HDTV perfectly; the quality of the picture was equally good. I rented this movie 3 years ago at Net-flix and the quality was horrible.<br /><br />I believe this is Marlon Brando's first attempt at directing. I really enjoyed this movie but it is very slow moving.  Even so, with Ben Johnson, Carl Malden, and Marlon Brando, Jacks is one of the best movies of its day. Brando is still young enough to play the romantic lead convincingly, Malden is both vile and believable, and Ben Johnson is a wildcard opportunist of the lowest kind.<br /><br />This is a great two hour and twenty minute yarn for a rainy night.
B008RYN44U|2.0|I hate giving a bad review, especially to No Doubt who I love. I waited a couple weeks and listened to the album about 5 times through before writing this. I want to attribute this album to cobwebs stemming from 11 years of no new releases. Let's call this a \\"transition album\\" -- you guys are back making music together again, I believe if you work on another album you can get that old No Doubt sound back again. \\"Settle Down\\" is the only song I enjoy on the album (although I wish the music video didn't prominently display L'oreal's brand name, kind of distracting when you know Gwen is a spokesmodel for them...)<br />\\"Push and Shove\\" is OK, and the other songs really just blend together for me.<br /><br />Like I said, I love No Doubt. But I reject the notion that one must \\"evolve\\" to match current radio hits -- whether it be an artist, a band, or a music lover. Here's the pop music that's on the radio: Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Drake, Lil' Jon, \\"LMFAO\\", and computer noise from DJ who-gives-a-shit. Lil' Jon pushes the artistic envelope with powerful lyrics like the masterful chorus from his collaboration with \\"LMFAO\\": \\"one shot, two shot, three shot, four!\\" Or the even more artistic lyrics from another recent collaboration with \\"LMFAO\\", in which the chorus is literally the word \\"shots\\" yelled exactly SIXTEEN times in a row, followed by the word \\"everybody!\\". Trying to get a band like No Doubt to adapt to that is silly and quite frankly insulting to No Doubt and their fans. Please, don't adapt. Great music is timeless.<br /><br />I've been a huge No Doubt fan since Tragic Kingdom came out when I was like 11. I love their first 4 albums (title CD \\"No Doubt\\", Beacon Street Collection, Tragic Kingdom, and Return of Saturn). Rock Steady was a solid album, and I have both Gwen Stefani solo CDs and even those grew on me over time. This album just feels so bland, like every rough edge was ground off and polished until it blended in with everything else. There are no stand-out guitar riffs, Adrian's drums are in the background at best (whereas in previous albums they really pushed the songs along with a nice loud snare drum and excellent rhythm).<br /><br />There is a simple question and I believe a simple answer for the next No Doubt album: No Doubt = Gwen, Tony, Adrian, and Tom... Which one of them plays the synth?<br /><br />Please, listen to some older albums. An example is \\"Happy Now?\\" from \\"Tragic Kingdom\\". In the first 20 seconds you have Adrian leading the rhythm with a loud snare and excellent riffs between verses/chorus, strong bass from Tony, you have Tom playing an excellent reggae rhythm background with awesome solos and riffs throughout the song, all mixed with great vocals from Gwen. Other examples are \\"Spiderwebs\\" from \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and \\"By The Way\\" from \\"The Beacon Street Collection\\". I want to hear the loud snare from Adrian, I want to hear riffs and solos from Tom, I want a driving bass that holds the song together from Tony, I want to hear some horns in the background, and I want to hear Gwen's signature voice. You guys are so talented, you don't need every song dominated by a synth or a computer.
B0039TD826|5.0|This is a unique Stones double-album that captures that band at their height... Mick Taylor on guitar (Brian Jones replacement) is amazing - period! Listening to the album is like taking a nice and soothing journey with the Greatest Band in Rock'n'Roll History. Give it a chance, it's different-sounding than some of their more popular bluesy songs (weaving in even more Stones' blues and even some country-esque sounding dittys)... Enjoy!
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I was greatly disappointed with the book.  Disliked the cases where young  men are given credit for such things as coming up with the Marshall Plan.  Carla's is raped and seems like it is not such a big deal.  From what I know about the Russian handling of German women it was unlike the Carla story.  Follette seems to me to have too many strong willed women in his books,  Nothing wrong with strong willed women but \\"so many\\"? Another complaint.  Characters in the book  from different counrtries seem to have no difficulty continually running in to each other in other countries.  Also, seems like far too many characters are illigitmate and find out they really belong to some other family or that they are really the half brother of someone they hate.  I could go on and on but will end by saying I would not in anyway recommend the book.  I greatly enjoyed Fall of Giants and World Without End.  Also by the time I read this last one I had forgotten all the characters in the Fall of Giants book (that being the first in the trilogy.  Next time I will wait until all three of a trilogy are in print so I can not have so much time between books.  It is likely I will read the third one when it comes out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter told me about this book and I think I loved it as much as she did. I would recommend it to anyone.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books, can't wait for this author to come out with new stuff!  Def a good read!
B0067H9VWS|5.0|Season two draws you in Nd brings you closer to the characters, with unanticipated twists and turns that keep you coming back for more
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|kids enjoy messing around with it too. a new twist on a classic game.and always nice when a decent game is free
B00932HEX2|5.0|This is indeed the best drama I've seen since the Wire.  The Emmys were well deserved both for the actors and the show.  Keep the seasons coming!
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Now I don't have to dig out my old import 45s to hear the rarities, also the remixes sound superb!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Riordan once again shows why his books are so entertaining. I couldn't stop once I started and now I cant wait until next Fall.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought the book because some one recommended it was a good read????<br />Evidently she has not read many good books? It was much too explicit<br />and I skimmed over most waiting for a plot ( which never happened) or<br />what was presented was very shallow. For some one who had little experience<br />sexually she certainly knew alot!! It just proves sex is what sells, Satans<br />world is devious and corrupt
B005LAIHSG|3.0|Rented this today from Redbox and was not as good as I was hoping. I mean I liked it ok but I got bored and had to fast forward through some of it. I loved some of the scenes. I wish they had more of the troll and the fairy woods. I love Kristen and Chris and loved them, but it was still just lacking something. I can't even tell you what, but either way, it was still ok but would only buy it at $5.00 or lower.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful movie went back and watched a second time. Rented it 1st time at Amazon will go back and purchase from there soon<br /> Enjoyed the charm of the characters and great great story.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|These guys are staying creative and this album is very nice. I think it's better than #2, lots of catchy songs and stays true to their formula.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I could not put this novel down for the entire two days it took me to read it, it is just THAT captivating. It is an incredible read that had me closing my eyes and begging for the success of the main character, Ethan, on many occasions. The ending didn‘t satisfy as much as I thought it would, but it is definitely worth the money, you won‘t be disappointed.
030758836X|2.0|I really loved reading this book...until the end. I enjoyed the back and forth between Nick's point of view and Amy's point of view. I could not put the book down to start out with and I was recommending it to everyone. I am so disappointed in the ending that I now take back my recommendation. It was a pointless read now that I know the ending, I had envisioned something much more.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|The movie is great, really hits all the parts from the graphic novel like it was taken from book to screen from frame to frame.<br />In the Recut, Extended and Unrated version you get the option to watch each part of the movie itself or view them all together.  There wasn't much added in terms of extending the film, a few comical parts with Marv and longer credits, which honestly, who needs that?<br />Special features are really nice, it's cool to see them break down parts of the movie especially the part that was specially directed by Quentin Tarantino in the car.<br />Maybe it's because the film is mostly black and white (minus a few color accents, mainly red), but it looks really good in HD and worthy of an upgrade if you're a fan of the film or bought into the original release which was movie only with no features whatsoever.
0385335997|5.0|I think this series was popular 10 or so years ago....I was too busy to read it then....  But I am enjoying it now.  I am on the third book in the series and cannot put the books down.  I find them well written (I keep a dictionary nearby)and full of history and romance and excitment. I am almost sad when I come to the end of each book...but releaved I have the next in the series to start.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Maybe not, with a nod to Lord of the Rings, but it's definitely the best original and sequel of all time, sorry Godfather Part III.  There's not a lot to say about a movie that has been written about for decades in one form or another.<br />The transer to blu-ray is amazing and really does the movie justice especially in the darker parts of the film.  This was Coppola's masterpiece and you can tell they took the time to make it look as good as possible.  They added a few special features in 2008 that wasn't in some of the past release of the Trilogy, and with those, there is A LOT to look forward to if you're a fan of the films, or even film in general.  This might be the most complete release of the movies that we will get, I don't know how anyone can be unhappy with their purchase.  Oh, and definitely don't miss out on the wonderful commentaries by Coppola himself if you're into that kind of thing.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|An excellent choice for fantasy lovers and for those who love stories of medieval times. The story flows well, pulling you along to the next page, next chapter. There are a few heart-stopping moments, when you wonder  if your favorite character is dead. Read on and find out!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is such a great read, Ken's research is so thorough and informative.  His story line flows at such a speed I didn't want<br />to stop reading and hated for the book to end.  He has a great talent for story telling and makes you feel like you are right there with the<br />characters during that time period.  If you want a book you don't want to put down read Winter of the World.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book, couldnt put them down. Read all three and have told my 6 sisters all about them. Best book Ive read in a long long time. Can't wait for the \\"movie\\" LOL

0525953728|1.0|Don't waste your time and money on this.<br />The book opens with a disclaimer that made me feel like I was about to be had, that the ghostwriter Maurer concocted it in about three days, and that it was not a true account at all, just something fabricated from all the news coverage.<br />Then I couldn't get past the unbelievably sloppy and dispassionate writing. Did the editor even read it?<br />Plowed through anyway. The book did not address the morality of the Bin Laden shooting and described the main storyteller in a way that convinced me he is a sociopath.<br />A clumsy effort.<br />Not even waiting for or bothering with the movie.
B007TK77QE|5.0|The start of this book is very slow and I was suprised Rowlings had chosen such a dull topic. After all local politics is tedious is any country. However, she draws you in with the development of her characters who despite being flawed and generally unpleasant lodged themselves in my mind leaving me thinking about them long after I finished the book. This is not a light hearted or humerous book, but is a easy read which I highly recommend.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|this program is very helpful for students it lets me veiw and work on the same document that i start at school but better i can take them any where when i dont have time at home like wating at the gargae for my carto get done
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Most amazing box set ever. The screw driver isnt just in his head, you actaully have to push on it to open his head to get the dvds. I was surprised it looks exactly like the picture. I didnt think it was gonna looks as good. Very pleased with this item.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is a continuation in the Series and picks up right where the other ends. It is exciting, has a bit of a love story, and is a very quick read.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Pink has grown as a performer with each album released.  This is a great cd with something for everyone to enjoy.
B001A3GSFW|5.0|This is a great album and I highly recommend buying it if you like the Ramones. It reminded me of watching Rock and Roll Highschool all over again.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|I enjoyed it very much, kept me on the edge of my seat with each episode and continues with the new season.  I am so grateful I could catch up on the first season with your DVD.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of placing two orders for the basically the same thing and couldn't cancel when I realized it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The movie was different and I loved that about it.  It gave each person's adventure as they go into their golden years.  Funny, sad and extremely hopeful.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Glad I didn't see it in the theater for $8.50 but not bad for a few bucks sitting at home. Besides the wife liked it.
B0058YPILY|5.0|What I loved about this season was that there were some really freaky episodes! And, of course, Emily was back...only to annouce her departure at the season finale, but still, the old team was back in action and catching bad guys, and isn't that what it's all about?
0525953728|5.0|An very well written narrative of a person who was there. If you do not have respect for those that do these jobs day in and day out, you MUST read this book. This book tells the true story of who did what in the operation to kill Ben Laden and it sure was not Obama!!  This operation was a results of years of intelligence, following up on leads, and doing what is necessary to get results.  A GREAT job by our intelligence services and members of our Armed Forces, especially, the Navy Seals.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love hearing what Reacher is thinking... It kept me woundering until the end.<br />I would have given it 5 stars but it lost me when they got into to who's who and why.<br />Everything else was great.  Thanks for another WILD ride!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|All the Conan Doyle works at once.  Excellent deal!  Table of contents allows you to pick what you want to read.  If you like Sherlock, you'll love this.
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|The movie is more unique than most love stories and has very adorable moments. It's a little drawn out in some places but I would definitely reccommend it.
0307700879|4.0|The style of this book is just amazing. Not written in a 'normal' way but in beautiful imagery and sentences. You feel for all the characters in the book too and the little world that they inhabit.
B005ONTD42|5.0|I got this after a week or so and I was so excited when it arrived. I opened it, started it, and rolled. It runs for a hour on a 3 hour charge. It is fast, waterproof, and you can drop it but not to much. I enjoy it a lot but, it has kind gotten old and it's fun has kinda worn off. I find it amazing of how it works and how well it works. I would buy it if you are on the fence, but keep the packege so if you don't like it you can send it back. The cost is a lot but it is worth it. The link to the company site is below.<br />[...]
0393338827|5.0|I listened to \\"The Big Short\\" on Audible, mostly as I was driving. I don't know if that was a great idea as some of the revelations in this book nearly caused me to crash!<br /><br />As terrifying in some ways as \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" and equally compelling. It would have been thoroughly enjoyable- full of intrigue and human failing save for one thing...it's true. I'm not completely naive; I knew Wall Street had it's share of miscreants, but Lewis reveals what to most of us are entirely new levels of depravity.<br /><br />This is the insider's view from the perspective of those who read the tea leaves and gambled on what they saw as an impending disaster. It's an incredible look at the high stakes world of non-productive financial speculation and there are no innocents. These are the people who created and exploited our ongoing economic disaster. Lewis gives us an accessible, albiet distasteful understanding of the power players who took the money and ran leaving the rest of us to pick up the tab.<br /><br />The fact that so many got away with this debacle, all the while soothing us with optimistic expert prognostications is sickening. For those of us who trusted those experts, this story is nauseating, yet fascinating. The characters are engaging- though I cannot find a redeeming quality in any of them. The entire book is reminiscent of \\"Glengarry, Glen Ross,\\" yet on an epic scale.<br /><br />I sincerely hope this book will put more of these crooks in jail and more important, will wake up the sleeping masses to the realization that we have been made into pawns and it's about time we did something about it.
055358894X|5.0|It started off slow and turned out fantastic. Fans of fantasy and heist stories will love this one, as well as anyone who loves a rich story and memorable characters.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it. its good for the whole family and my 13 and my 9 year old love this app and I am 37 and I even like this app.  It doesn't freeze up on me and it works perfectly fine.  I hope this review helped you to show how much your family can work together on this app.
0316056871|5.0|Great read, wish it were longer. I hear the audio version is the best, so you might want to pick that up instead of the print or Kindle version.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This is perfect for a person on the go.  I can set it up anywere I happen to be & still use my hands.  I think it suits my busy lifestyle.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever got my hands on. The (then) trio has power and a presence that is rarely seen these days! Anyone from the old-school rocker to the ones trying to find authentic and solid rock these days should give Wolfmother a chance to blow their minds!
034580404X|5.0|This was the best series of books I can ever remember reading.  Wonderfully written you can not put it down.  I laughed, cried, and got angry as did Ana and Christain. The intrigue is spellbinding so much so that you CAN NOT stop reading.  The steamy parts are good but the plot is even better.  I came away with an understanding of  how with love and patience you can change a person's entire life.  After all that is what life is about, helping one another get through hard times, even though they made mistakes.<br />Yes it is not for the young reader but there are a lot of lessons that can be learned here.  I have read it through three times and even on the third time through I had a problem putting it down.  I sure hope Mrs. James will publish more in the future.  I can not wait to read her work again!
B0031RS69G|5.0|Terry Pratchett is a master with words and in Discworld he takes a good long, humorous look at the society we have. Rincewinds adventures together with a tourist is a blast to read and once you start, you will be finished with the book before you know it. Craving for more, and luckily this book is only the start to a grand adventure with Discworld.
B007H9B6KA|5.0|Big Garbage fan and this album does not disappoint.  Fits in well with discography and all and all a great listen.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I usually only write reviews for books that are so good I don't have any other choice but to give praise.  Never have I left a less than stellar review until now!! I did read Bared To You at the suggestion of someone who thought it was better than Fifty...not even close.  However, I enjoyed how the story unfolded between Eva and Gideon in the first book; it left me anxious for the second book of this trilogy.  This book took me waayyyyy to long to finish, it was all over the place, I felt no emotional connection with the characters and I felt like I needed to see my therapist after reading this one!! It was unbelievable....I get that these two are both dealing with past sexual abuse, but some of this just didn't make sense....just a really bad roller coaster ride.  Promising to be exciting but never getting the altitude for a great drop.  I did however give it two stars instead of one because the ending proved to be somewhat entertaining...everything else fell flat. Not sure I want to read the final book.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Very simple game and easy to play but addictive. I couldn't tell you why. The missions and upgrades keep you playing. They do have things you can buy with real money, but you really don't need to, so it's really a free game.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of nostalgia! It contains songs I learned and heard as a child and Paul Mcartney has added his own special touches. Its great!
B00540G3G6|4.0|Compared to how good some post conversion 3D can be, Titanic 3D & Lion King, I was expecting more from Nightmare.  I would recommend saving the money and getting the regular blu-ray.
0374214913|1.0|I bought this yesterday and read it through last night thanks to insomnia. While the experience was indeed better than scrunching my eyes closed and counting sheep, ultimately I would have preferred the sleep.<br /><br />This novel seemed right up my bibliophilic alley, but I didn't realize I was buying geek fetish porn. I'm unclear as to whether this was intentional, but the plot ostensibly reveals one cult while the author proselytizes for the cult of Google Mater. The key plot secrets are as guessable as they are unbelievable regardless of deus ex virtua machina.<br /><br />I felt nothing but sadness for one of the main characters, emptier than most, dedicating her life and energy to Google in the hope of eternity while visualizing ad sales. I know I want to be an immortal superman, forever helping benighted lesser hominids find free porn whilst contemplating the all between mesothelioma ads.<br /><br />It may be the subject for another time and place, but I'm left only wondering whether the author and his circle really worship Google or whether he's reflecting a greater flaw in society at large.  I'd rather believe in a small group of fools than a nearly universal large one.
B000WLNZX6|5.0|Lost my original CD somehow.  Had to buy a digital version to play for some friends - could not imagine not having this music in my collection.  A great album of duets!
B00846REIS|1.0|Same old....same old.......over and over....not very exciting. I  found the characters doing the same routine almost every day and having sex almost the same way numerous times.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is a great second book to Bared to You.  The mystery and suspense in the second half of this book had me pulled in and I didn't want it to end.  I didn't want to put it down.  I hope there is a book three.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Despite have uninstalled and reloaded the Kindle app 3x, I still have to &quot;force close&quot; the app almost every use. New pins are sometimes uploaded in triplicates or more. One jewelry pin was uploaded 11x!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I really love this game! Currently working on single spider but hoping to graduate to the next level soon. I spend hours at this game. It is addictive.
B009KUANWG|3.0|I'm an Adele addict/freak. I saw her live after her first album came out and new instantly she was the best thing since sliced bread. Nice to see how people came on board in the last year or so with her second offering, Adele 21. So people DO have good taste. Who would have thought? Her climb to fame pleases me more than you know, let there be no doubt. I'm far from being your typical greedy Republican be-atch.<br />I was expecting/hoping for a spectacular Bond song. Spectacular it is not. There I said it. It's good and passes the Bond test...just not spectacular.<br />As I say this, though, I should offer this rebuttal. I was singing Skyfall in the shower tonight. My two dogs were more enthralled and more riveted than they have ever been watching me shower. So what do I know?
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book starts out interesting and captures the reader. The story builds and somewhat drags. The ending is SO disappointing. Its as if the writer gave up and just decided to come up with a lame ending and finish the book. I was really disappointed at the end and frustrated I wasted time reading it after it was finished.
B008I34XUY|5.0|Frank Zappa Had two albums worth of music. He was recording Over Night Sensation & Apostrophe. Both albums featured the then current Mothers Of Invention. My persnol favriote line up. In both of these you get Blues,Funk,Jazz,Rock and all music elements. Frank was and in many ways still is at the top of this music that inspired others to play on a creative level that is not found in most music. I highly recomend Frank's music to those who have a need for something that regular air play music can not offer. You can't go wrong by adding this album to your collection. - Rick Glenn
B00846REIS|3.0|This book was brainless and fun to read after a long, stressful day. However, I had just finished the Grey trilogy and found this a bit redundant. The most frustrating part was the ending. The author could have creatively come up with something much more interesting!
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|I got this because it works well on my Android phone, I can't even get the thing to load a video on my Fire HD as it crashes right away upon opening. I ended up buying CineXPlayer which plays everything on the Fire. This MX Player app however plays nothing and just crashes.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The product arrived VERY timely and worked as advertised. Very simple to use and worth the money. This is an economical solution to Apples' lack of engineering to include this on their tablets.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It was slow for me in a few places, but overall an excellent book!  It's hard for me to get really wrapped up in a book, but at most times reading this one I didn't want to put it down.  I don't know much about the assassination or assassin but I felt like this was thought out amazingly well, with evidence of very thorough research.
1905236042|2.0|I work with young children ages 3-6 in a Montessori classroom.  These cards although they are fun and list somewhat clear instructions, are not easy for this age group to read and comprehend.  The pictures are cartoon like and not realistic in how a child's body may actually bend or twist or reach to achieve the pose.  If you are shopping for young children, I recommend that you focus on clearer and more realistic examples - for example I found some SUPERB cards and curriculum through Marsha Wenig (sp?) her book is called Yoga Kids. It also it really geared for children & has names that correlate more closely with actual yoga names & terminology - well in many case at least - ex: downward dog.  In conclusion, if these are for children, Keep Shopping!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read all 3 books of the trilogy, one after the other. The characters were believable and likeable if you read all of the books. I love the ending. Book one and two cold have been combined.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A little predictable but still draws you in! ill still have to read the third book to complete the story.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I would like to say I loved seeing Prometheus. So much I saw it twice in theaters. However, the movie is no where near perfect. I came in the theater expecting a great scifi movie with scares around every corner. Nothing! There are a few scenes that might scare people easily, but it's predictable when a scary scene is going to happen. Many of the characters were just there to die. They served no purpose but to be extras for the crew and die when the storyline had nothing for them. Many of the subplots where empty and didn't go no where. The story of Peter, his biological daughter Meredith Vickers, and David who he saw as the son he always wanted went no where! This movie could have been so much if they had great characters and storyline. I loved the visuals and the technology they used in the film. David was my favorite character in the film. Peter as an elderly entrepreneur was awesome and Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw was awesome. Prometheus is a good movie to enjoy if you're a fan of scifi films. Not a perfect film. But I guarantee you'll love it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I'm not sure why I look forward to playing but I'll be darned if I don't!  good game to kill tine just wisg so much good stuff didn't fall offthe edges!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack never fails to let me down.  I also can't ever put his books down until I finish reading them.  I think I like the way he goes into to detail about the roads, towns, timing etc.  Just wish Lee Child was a faster writer.  Two a year would be nice.
034580404X|5.0|At first I've read all three books of Fifty shades on my computer. But than I decided that I have to add the Thrilogy to my home library.<br />The paper is not very good, but considering the price it's ok.
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|This is a great film and really shows the lives of chimpanzee's that we never get to see.  It's a great family movie, but there is a part where the little chimp loses his mother that would be very sad for a child, and tries to get with some of the other mothers who reject him.  There is a good ending, however, you have to watch it to see how this little guy solves the problem of finding a new guardian and teacher.  You'll enjoy it!
1423140605|5.0|Overall, another great read by Rick Riordan.  I love the complexities of the relationships.  I kind of feel bad for Leo, but that's his lot in life.  The relationships between Piper and Jason and Percy and Annabeth are well drafted.  I'm so glad to finally hear Annabeth's heart and inside her head.  And the Percabeth love story, with their struggles just to be together, was well written and exciting.  Piper and Jason were fairly well explained, but I wish we could know just a little more.  It feels like their love story is written mostly from Jason's view and less from Piper.  Perhaps, that's just because they don't have much of a story yet...more in the next book?.  I do feel like there is a background story to Percy and Annabeth...perhaps based in Greek mythology?...that gives more depth to their role.  I don't think it's just a 21st Century affair.<br /><br />I really wish there had been more of a story with Hazel and Frank, though.  They were explained alright in Son of Neptune, but they are neglected in Mark of Athena.<br /><br />Leo definately took center stage...especially the ending.  I want so badly to see him succeed and for everyone to see his true heart.  Definately loving Leo almost as much as the Percy/Annabeth saga.<br /><br />Pretty much hate the Romans right now...but I guess that's the point.  I hope Reyna can work her magic.  Or that Octavian falls in a ditch and gets buried...either/or. :)<br /><br />It's going to be an agonizing wait...Rick Riordan, you are cruel for that ending, but I absolutely loved it.  Great work! Do we have a name or even a possible release date to mark on the calendar?
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Who would pick up a hitchhiker with duct tape on his nose? Jack Reacher always has interesting adventures. This one is no exception. Lee Child's story lines pull me in every time. Now I'm waiting to see if he makes it to Virginia to meet the phone lady.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I love this movie!! Such a tear jerker!! I seen it on TV and knew I had to own this!
B007SGLZH6|3.0|I was looking forward to trying the recipe with My Kindle standing by. The story about the flour and ingredients was interesting, but I wanted a straight forward list of ingredients and cooking instructions. (After the main story). However, I have tried the recipe and it turned out great. Had a nice slice of the hot bread straight out of the Dutch Oven with lashings of butter. Then I had to have a nice long walk. It was difficult using the measurements etc as they are different to the Australian measurements, but I got by. Good book!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Wow- while the time period was not as interesting to me as the first book the historical presentation is first rate. This gives a true 21 century view of WWII and the events leading up to the cataclysmic event. The German episodes are well known but American history has always short changed the Japanese need to consider war as a means of maintaining trade and industry.<br />Providing the history against a family backround allows the reader to become involved on a personal level in addition to a global or macro level.<br />The Soviet era and need for a bomb was also well documented allowing fictional persons to represent actual situations.<br />I cannot wait for the next edition.
0316227706|5.0|I highly recommend adding this book to any coffee or end table. It has been an amazing conversation piece so far and does a great job of bringing out the playful side of our pets through very unique and stunning images.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the photographer follows this up with a sequel titled Underwater Cats. Yes!
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Since there are other reviews based solely on device-specific criticism and not on the content, I figured it'd be logical to write a positive review in the same way. The paper edition seems to work natively without any apps. The right combination of gravity and friction make for a steady reading experience in my hands. In space (or any zero-G environment) I might not even have to hold the book! I'd probably hold the book anyway; it'd be strange reading a floating book. Sadly, the print version doesn't seem to work well in the dark, but hindsight is 20/20. Since it functions well enough in sunlight or under artificial light, I didn't negate four stars. Inman & co: please think ahead for the next version. Glow-in-the-dark pages are a must.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing coin dozer it keeps you interested and i dont want to put it down. it is a great stress reliever.
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|Most movies portray as the girl falling in love first. This movie was a refreshing change showing where the boy falls in love first and then the girl to come to the realization she is in love too. The atmosphere between the two actors was awesome. I was dead tired when I was watching the film and the humor and fun of the piece was a second wind of straight laughter.
B000M341RI|4.0|everything expected but think that should have all major actors interviewed.  Is there a chance of a sequel to this film? Characters in lives now and or updated
B009K45Y62|1.0|This movie was a let down for me, weak tea for the batman franchise.  It reminded me a effects rich/ plot poor movie.
0141324902|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid by Jeff Kinney<br /><br /> I loved this book! I found myself laughing until I cried even just a couple of pages in. Okay, okay. So it was intended for children. I had heard a lot of mixed reviews about this book before I actually found the courage to pick it up and read it, but with two boys about the same age as the main character, curiosity finally got the best of me.<br /> I thought the cartoons were what made this book so great. The book would have been funny even without them, but those cartoons were what made this book magical.<br /> I read some of the other reviews for this book after reading it, and I completely disagree with the people who said this book was a bad influence. I can totally see my boys thinking the same things the author wrote here. I thought Jeff Kinney did an excellent job of showing us the more unfortunate side of being a kid. There were some cringe-worthy moments (The creepy neighbor kid, after his sugar high.) but over all I thought it added to the story.<br /> I really enjoyed this book, maybe I'll go watch the movie now.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I really like these headphones! I don't like the feeling of earbuds pushed in my ear. These just rest inside, but not in the ear canal. They have excellent sound quality. Just what I wanted for walking on my treadmill!!!!
B009HSVHV2|5.0|KISS still has it after 40 years of Rocking. I have been waiting a long time for this album and I am not disappointed at all. This album rocks for the first chord to the very last. Here is my rating for each song:<br />Hell Or Hallelujah - 5 stars<br />Wall Of Sound - 4.5 stars<br />Freak - 4.5 stars<br />Back To The Stone Age - 4.5 stars<br />Shout Mercy - 4 stars<br />Long Way Down - 3.5 stars<br />Eat Your Heart Out - 4 stars<br />The Devil Is Me - 4 stars<br />Outta This World - 3.5 stars<br />All For The Love Of R&R - 4.5 stars<br />Take Me Down Below - 5 stars<br />Last Chance - 4 stars<br />Right Here Right Now - 4.5 stars<br /><br />Paul and Genes voice sound great, I have heard older singer lose it with age but Gene and Paul still got it. Eric Singer sound great on drums, I love Peter and Eric Carr, but Eric Singer is a better drummer. Tommy gutair is rocking, Ace, Vinnie and Bruce were great gutair player and Tommy continues the tradition going. I hope you all enjoy this album as much as I do, Go see them live, just saw them in September in Cleveland and the show is as good as ever. YOU WANTED THE BEST YOU GOT THE BEST KISS!!!!!!!!
B008OJ291W|4.0|I bought this album out of excitement over Jeff Lynne's other new release Long Wave.  I think this ELO album will appeal to both hard-die fans as well as casual newcomers to ELO.  These re-makes sound very similar to the originals, but clearer and cleaner.  Most songs in this album have definitely improved their sound quality vs the originals - as you can hear the guitars and the main vocals as if they have been filtered through crystal.  I'm not too fussy about Telephone Line though, the intro is not as cool as the original one.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|It was a good read.  Not quite to the standards of past Jack Reacher novels, but I still enjoyed it.<br />It wasn't quite as believable as I would have liked, but I would recommend it to fans of Jack Reacher<br />BobLStLouis
B007GCY8FS|3.0|After the disappointing news, that Tom Cruise would be portraying Reacher in the first movie from the series, I was really hoping this would be a SLAM-Dunk of a book. Not so much. Between Reacher's internal dialogue on numbers, to his lackluster interaction with multiple other characters, this installment in the series left me feeling just as betrayed as the Cruise casting decision does.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, the author, should keep his characters political leanings to himself.. Especially when he does not reference them in any of the books, but tries to pander to the American press.<br /><br />Please bring back the Reacher I have grown attached to, otherwise I will be departing, after NOT watching the movie.<br /><br />PS: I'm hoping this movie is not following in the Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum/Katherine Heigel (sic) book series, to movie FLOP pattern.
1608862771|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo170D3OI0YZUVG]]It's just another typical day in a town imagined by Mattias Adolfsson. On one street there's a car caught in a traffic of sheep herded by an old man, right at the junction there's a pink dinosaur. In the back alley is another dinosaur, this one with a hat and handbag. Up on the roof, a tractor is plowing soil. On a nearby roof, archers are practicing with their target boards.<br /><br />What I've described above is just a small scene picked from the cover art of a town buzzing with activity. There are many more imaginative drawings inside this 128-page paperback book that's curiously made to look like a Moleskine sketchbook with its rounded page corners. I love looking at the sketches. There's so much detail in his whimsical scenes and idiosyncratic characters. This book collects his sketches from 2006 to 2012.<br /><br />I also have his earlier sketchbook called The First In Line which is selling only on his blog. I would recommend getting that as well because of the hardcover, paper and printing quality that I think is better than Mattias Unfiltered. Not that the production quality of this book is bad, it's just that his first sketchbook is better. The colour printing for this book is slightly lighter, lacking the contrast and vibrancy compared to the first book. There isn't any duplicated work on either book.<br /><br />It's a charming and inspiring sketchbook. I'll be going back to it regularly, it seems that each time I look at the sketches, I would see something new that I've missed out.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B008MEM24S|3.0|If you enjoyed [[ASIN:B006D1ONE4 Where's My Water?]], and even if you can't stand Phineas and Ferb, you'll probably still enjoy this.  Much the same, not all that difficult.<br /><br />Personally, I think I prefer WMW, because it makes sense (of a sort).... trying to get water to help a reptile take a shower.  Perfect sense.  In WMP, you're trying to move water to \\"power underground backup hydro-generators\\" so Perry can get to briefing.<br /><br />Still, for a buck?  They are (so far?) keeping good on the \\"promise\\" for more levels, they just added a new chapter the other day (five now, instead of four)
B008PZ69T8|5.0|The Fifty Shades of Grey classical album is a terrific compilation of some of the most beautiful music out there. Even if you are not a Fifty Shades of Grey fan, you cannot help but enjoy this collection. It is a very good introduction to some of the best and most famous composers of all time. I urge everyone to give it try, you may be surprised how much you enjoy listening to this album.
B000003TSP|5.0|'Portishead,' the 1997 eponymous sophomore effort from Bristol trip-hop pioneers, doesn't quite get the same praise as its predecessor, the sultry noir of 1994's 'Dummy.'  Although the second time around isn't quite as groundbreaking as the first, 'Portishead' is arguably a more cohesive final product.  It's a lot darker and angrier - when the most upbeat song, relatively speaking, is titled \\"Mourning Air,\\" I think that pretty much speaks for itself - but every bit as polished as 1994's Mercury Prize winner.  Building a collage from multiple sources of inspiration, Portishead delve everywhere from jazz fusion (\\"All Mine\\"), to torch songs (\\"Undenied,\\" \\"Only You\\") and the theatrical soundscapes of the somber \\"Western Eyes.\\"  On the darker side of things, we have \\"Cowboys,\\" \\"Seven Months\\" and \\"Elysium,\\" which all relegate frontwoman Beth Gibbons to a sort of banshee, chewing out her lines in a witchy snarl.  \\"Half Day Closing\\" is perhaps the most experimental song in the set, blending a sort of slowed-down post-punk with heavily distorted wailing.  Not music for the corner barbershop.<br /><br />The band kind of burned out after this record, and it would be over a decade before the world got to hear the very bleak follow-up, 2008's 'Third.'  Yet 'Portishead' embodies everything that the middle third of a trilogy should have.  Progression, cohesion, the perfect segue from the coffee shop trip-hop of the first album, to the dark and introverted alt-rock stylings of the third.<br /><br />Highlights:  \\"Over,\\" \\"Humming,\\" \\"Only You,\\" \\"Western Eyes\\"
0596805527|3.0|I had difficulty deciding what rating to give this book. There is good news and bad news. The good news is that it covers a lot of territory, many of the examples are excellent and some particularly tricky Javascript subtleties are covered well. The bad news is that it is poorly organized and has some significant style problems, especially when compared to similar O'Reily books for other languages. Coverage is also sporadic. Some subjects are covered in excruciating detail while others are barely mentioned.<br /><br />One of the problems is that the language tends to be sloppy. The author frequently makes statements that have a passing resemblance to the subject but are technically wrong at some level of detail. Experienced programmers will get the point he is making but novices might be mislead on subtle issues. He also has a bad habit of stating his own style biases as if they were facts. I almost always agree with his style choices but when approaching a programming language it is important to distinguish between useful advice about language usage from precise facts about language implementation. The author doesn't do this well.<br /><br />Most of my complaints are things a good editor should have fixed. The author's technical understanding is excellent. I'm sure that with better editing support he would have created a better book. That's usually what you get from an O'Reilly book. They generally have a gift for drawing good work out of knowledgeable techno-geeks that may not have the best communication or presentation skills. Not this time.<br /><br />For sure this is not a book for novices but experienced programmers trying to come up to speed on Javascript will probably be able to navigate around the deficiencies and get good use from this book. It is not a waste of money. At least that is my experience. I use it but it certainly makes me question my automatic reflex to \\"get the O'Reilly book.\\" O'Reilly fell down on their editing job on this one.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This a Ken Follett classic. Meticulously researched the interwoven story was gripping and in places confronting especially the fall of Berlin.<br />The conflict between Nazi and Communist confirmed similar motivation towards world domination at any cost and the weakness of democracies in the face of this level of public intimidation and degradation.<br /><br />A breakdown in the economic structure as the basis of revolution, the cynical retention class distinction and feudalism and the refusal to allow for an egalitarian society and the retention of old systems and dogma.<br /><br />Regrettably a review of modern history shows that the \\"bitches are on heat again\\" with demonisation of cultures and politics to the fore in both the democracies and in the totalitarian regimes. This modern rise of extremism is certainly a underlying feature of Scandinavian novelists as well and was regrettably manifest in the atrocity of Oslo.<br /><br />The current political influence of minorities in the US and Europe does not bode well should history repeat itself as the \\"tinder in lit\\" as the middle class as well as the poor become disenfranchised as the rich become increasingly self serving.<br /><br />This novel is a timely reminder that history should not be disregarded and many of the actors of the time as still around and cognisant of what occurred and see the signs that it could happen again.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|Ishiguro has written a brilliant classic - don't let his Japanese name distract you - it's a quintessential English book, post WWI with lots of international implications seen from and experienced by a professional english Butler in a<br />classic English \\"great house\\" with all of the attendant \\"great people\\" on the scene.<br /><br />His relationships with his father, and his supposedly subordinate staff are more than intriguing. A great work of modern fiction(even though it was made into an award-winning movie).
B005DOKIYG|3.0|This product is ok..their is no room inside to store the stylus, also, I wanted a cover  that also acts like a stand.  So I might  need to purchase another .Nv

B001UDYI9K|5.0|I enjoyed this CD when I received it, but it's become my touchstone as I deal with losing my brother.  \\"Golden Key,\\" \\"I Can See Round Corners,\\" \\"Along the Road Together,\\" \\"Somewhere in the Audience\\" and \\"Immortal\\" seemed to have been written for the express purpose of getting me through this awful moment in my life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Luv it! I had the free version of blok story and finally got minecraft. my opinion is that mine craft is way better! :)
B002SR2PKG|5.0|A classic example of the book delivering an experience that TV can't touch.  The 1st 'real' book I ever read remains the best.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The first half and the second half of this book are like two entirely different books. The first half is wonderful - eerie, suspenseful, insightful, great characterizations. You get the feeling that you're gearing up for some grand unraveling of a complex story.<br /><br />Then you get to the second part, and BOOM. There is no unraveling. There is no complexity. In the length of a few sentences, you are outright explained nearly everything, and you find out that most of the things you know to be true from the first part are outright lies. After this, the two narrators become completely unrealistic - they are caricatures, cartoonish and unbelievable. Furthermore, there is nowhere for the story to go after this point. The rest of the book is basically just waiting for one outcome or another. But wait - that outcome never arrives. No, the book just ends. Incredibly disappointing end for a book that had some great potential.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|After searching for quite a while for this movie in Blue Ray, I happened on an Amazon site.  The price for this NEW blue-ray DVD was less than half the price for the same video in local stores.  Honestly, it sounded \\"too good to be true.\\"  It arrived quickly, was new and the quality is great.  It WAS true!  We're very pleased with our purchase.
0553470469|4.0|I was very impressed with how fast this product came and it was in quite good shape for used.  But then I've never been disappointed.
B004N6369Y|3.0|Good book.  I love New York and all of the differnet hotels there. Easy read at first then got slow in the middle.  Still reading will update when finished.
0394583892|5.0|I presently own this book but played it so much, one of the tapes wore out.  I was very pleased to be able to find it.  The case isn't in very good shape but I'll just use my old one.  This is the greatest book on tape I have ever listened to.
B00008GKEG|5.0|I've wanted to see this anthology for years,  but never got around to searching it out.  It was everything I had hoped it would be.  I'm a huge Beatle fan,  so I devour most everything on the subject.  Quality was great, price was right,  shipping was very quick...who could ask for more?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is a great read.  The author gets down to details without being boring.  I love the way his excitement for his job shined thru in the book.  Anyone who is interested in our national security should read No Easy Day and see just what goes on behind the scene.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|my father loved the book and was so thankul I could get it for him at the price and the condition it was/ You made me look good in my Fathers eyes. thanks
0316228532|1.0|Let me preface by saying I did not go into this thinking about HP. I knew that this was an adult book and not in the fantasy genre. I got it (from the library, thankfully) out of curiosity because I wanted to see how well she could write an adult book.<br /><br />Wow, just wow. I'm not the type to be \\"offended\\" by sex and cursing and I wasn't in this case either. When it's used in excess, though, it feels like a cheap and childish way to try to get the reader interested in the book. It felt to me like her writing was a bit forced. One thing that I'm happy I read in a review before I went any further into the novel is this (and yes, I'm capitalizing this on purpose to bring attention to it):<br /><br />THERE IS A RAPE IN THIS BOOK. IF THIS CAUSES A TRIGGER FOR YOU, DON'T READ IT.<br /><br />Obviously there isn't going to be a memo on the cover about this, but considering many will read this since she wrote it, people that have triggers because of rape should know beforehand. I apologize if anyone gets mad at the spoiler.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Where're we going if we praise such books? We have genious modern authors but this fairytail is the Bestseller! There are some scenes right from \\"Pretty Woman\\" - he ordered her all dishes the breakfast could offer, she asks \\"Do people always do what you tell them\\" and his \\"Yes, if they want to keep their job\\", then the helicopter not to Opera, but to the huge house on the top of building (Iron Man?). And Mrs James doesn't think at all about conjugation and agreement of times. And the book was translated to other languages repeating these mistakes! What a shame! And we read and buy and it's trylogy.
B000Y03O5O|5.0|I am not a native Spanish speaker but I have been studying the language over the past ten years. I was told that if i really wanted to learn Spanish that i needed to immerse myself in the language and the culture. Juan Luis Guerra' s music was introduced to me as a place to start. His songs make you want to move and the lyrics are awesome. I am hooked. I am a fan for life now.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|I pre-ordered the big chalupa (4 disc) version of Prometheus, fully expecting to be able to stream it through Amazon.  When I saw that it wasn't in my digital pre-order queue on Amazon, I got curious and started digging.<br /><br />Nobody at Amazon could tell me exactly what \\"digital copy\\" meant or who was serving that content.  Being smarter than the average bear and having a strong grasp of the google, I was disappointed that an answer was lacking.<br /><br />So here's your answer: it's an UltraViolet digital download.  (for info about UltraViolet see the wikipedia article on \\"UltraViolet (system)\\")<br /><br />Personally, I don't like the UV system, and I'm very disappointed that Amazon has a product description that is ambiguous to the point of being misleading.  (Amazon Instant is the only streaming service named near the words \\"digital download\\").  I see other titles explicitly name the UV system, but this one, frustratingly, does not.<br /><br />So for those who want to know, there you go.  That's what you get for unnamed \\"Digital Download\\" included with Prometheus.<br /><br />If you care about this, please let Amazon know.  If they do effect changes, I'll update this to reflect that.<br /><br />UPDATE: A slip in the case also mentions a second \\"Digital Copy\\" available from \\"degonline.org\\" which is supposed to be compatible/transferable to iTunes.  The same \\"Redemption Code\\" is used for either.  It suggests either UV or degonline.org, but not both.
1612680011|5.0|\\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" highlights the key differences in the way people at different income levels think.  It also talks about investments.  I could try to go into more detail but really, you should just read this book.
B000QUCNXG|3.0|Loved the one sided conversation presntation. At first I thought it would be a very difficult read but it wasn't at all. It was amazingly clear. It presented an interesting insight of an outsiders view of America. There was not much else.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Keith did a decent job of assembling slightly fragmented memories of a wild era.  You can see through the anecdotes to observe post-war Britain and the attitudes it fostered, the explosive 60's, etc.  For what it's worth, this would have been so much more balanced an interesting with video and more photo excerpts integrated into the story.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I wasn't blown away by the summer single \\"Hell or Hallelujah,\\" but as a long-term member in good standing in the Kiss Army, I was still understandably excited about this 20th studio album.  After two thorough listens, I *still* come up short on how to describe it!  I definitely think it's the logical successor to \\"Sonic Boom,\\" while at the same time I'm unable to compare it to ANY of their previous releases.  When \\"SB\\" came out, it very clearly sounded like an attempt to recapture the glorious riffs of \\"Rock and Roll Over.\\"  With \\"Monster,\\" I feel almost like I did when \\"Revenge\\" came out 20 years ago:  it both sounded exactly like what ought to have followed \\"Hot in the Shade,\\" and yet sounded *nothing* like its predecessor.<br /><br />Paul Stanley has often said (although not in so few words) that he despises comparisons between albums:  \\"Oh, that sounds like \\"Creatures\\" mixed with \\"Love Gun,\\" or whatever.  In the case of \\"Monster,\\" I can see why.  I could go out on a limb and say that \\"Monster\\" is what you'd get if you threw \\"Animalize\\" in a blender with \\"Carnival of Souls,\\" then whipped in liberal amounts of Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, and other blues-based early '70s rock.  But even that kind of comparison falls weakly on my ears.  I just...don't hear anything like this in the Kiss canon.<br /><br />I DO think the songwriting took a big leap over \\"SB,\\" and the intricate guitar work is thunderous.  This is *definitely* a guitar-driven album!  The singing is good, and although Paul sounds a little raspier in 2012, there's none of the hoarseness and vocal pops that have so dominated the Kiss live show over the last two tours.  Tommy's guitar playing, while definitely out of the Blue Cheer/Ace Frehley school of melodic lead, sounds WAY less Ace-ish than it did on \\"SB.\\"  The reverb on the record is good without being overpowering, and in all I find the mix really easy on the ears (esp. compared to the painful way \\"Destroyer Resurrected\\" comes across).  Eric and Tommy get their obligatory songs, each sounding more-or-less like their original counterparts:  Tommy's ode-to-Spaceman \\"Outta This World\\" could almost BE Ace vocal-wise, and if Eric had abused his voice with booze for decades he'd be a dead-ringer for Peter.  Still, their songs are pretty great, and point up an interesting thing:  for me, I like the LAST five songs better than the FIRST five.  Go figure.<br /><br />In all, this album sounds refreshingly modern, even as it obviously exists locked in the temporal time-slip that is hard rock/heavy metal.  I'm pretty sure I'll be listening to \\"Monster\\" on my daily commute for the next couple of weeks; it's a solid album, and worthy of the Kiss lexicon.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|An enjoyable read. I feel this author has a lot of potential. His style is unique and refreshing. The ending was unexpected and quite intriging. I would highly recommend this book.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Recently I was in Beaune, France.  After midnight.  A rainy night in what seemed like the end of the world.  Over my iPad, I got a notice from her website (...) that they had a preview of I THINK IT'S GOING TO RAIN by Randy Newman.  So there I was, halfway around the world from my home base and Barbra's beautiful voice, thrilling highs and delightful phrasing filled the empty night.  I knew everything would be OK in the morning (and it was).  She has that sort of power.<br /><br />Culled from her private vaults, these are songs that Ms. Streisand personally rejected from former projects.  After listening to them, I can't imagine why she (or anyone) would not have them on any of her albums.  Yes, they are that good.<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Try the legendary HOW ARE THINGS IN GLOCCA MORRA/ HEATHER ON THE HILL.  For over fifteen years, there have been excited whispers about this compilation.  Eagerly, Barbra Streisand's fans awaited to hear it.  Well, all I can say is:  It was worth the wait.<br /><br />Starting with BEING GOOD (Which is more a personal philosophy for the lady than a song), all the way to HOME (From \\"The Wiz\\"), the special Streisand touch is on each of these numbers making them priceless.<br /><br />Some might grouse that these are not songs recently recorded.  Know what?  Who cares?  Listen to her playful and insightful duet with herself on MOTHER AND CHILD and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />Yes, the songs are a curious mixture of tunes.  Frankly, if it weren't for her perfect pitch, LOST IN WONDERLAND would be an unwise selection but her magic makes it, and the other 11 tunes, work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app it has so many plans. I read through the bible every year. I have since 1993.  But this app gives me so much more, its  blessing.

B0052RDHTM|4.0|While not on the level of Pillars of the Earth, Follett still hooks the reader with a fascinating entanglement of characters and plots. The book keeps the reader engrossed and cheering for various characters all the way through. It also leaves the reader wanting more which is fine now that Winter of the World has been released.

B008LV8TSU|5.0|I love this story. I didn't want to put it down. Can't wait to read more. Howl and Sophie are wonderful characters what are they going to do next?
B007VYDFMS|5.0|AWESOME! Thank you to the producers of this film on humanity's beloved brother Bob Marley. This is absolutely THE best depiction of his life and certainly the most thorough that I have seen. I really appreciated the producer's successful attempt to humanize Bob, beyond the spiff smoking music master that we always see him shown as.  He was a powerful being with the best of intentions for humanity, without regard for race.  His life is a testament for how we should all put our beliefs into action.  Anybody who wants to get an understanding of who this man really was, watch Marley and you'll find him.  I cried at the end.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Simple but addictive. I hate waiting for more coins, but really enjoy figuring out the physics of the game. Collecting prizes and puzzle pieces keeps me playing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is finally on kindle fire! and its better than ever! I strongly suggest purchasing this game weather you have played it before or not. It looks amazing on the big screen, and is smoother than butter! I highly suggest buying this amazing game.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book so I knew what to expect, but that did not affect the compelling story. I LOVED the book! A disturbing story, but I connected right away to the main characters. I loved their fire and determination! Couldn't wait to start the second book in the series!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Like being able to rent online.  Good movie to follow the book.  The book is a must read first however, it provides more detail.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Our entire family of 6 with ages 9 - 42 read this book together while traveling.  We all loved it.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Wonderful book for semi-hard core SiFi fans.  I know enough physics and can \\"do the math\\" enough to get into the theoretical stuff.  I really enjoyed that the hard science is mixed with soft concerning aging and synthetic people.  I bought the sequel and enjoyed it as well.  For a page turner that makes you think just a little, this is great stuff.
B004JHYRDQ|4.0|I read this book because my 11 year old nephew chose it for a 6th grade term project.  The book is a simple read, but still quite interesting.  The end of each chapter leaves you hanging, forcing you to continue reading.  I enjoyed the book, and so did my nephew.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Great movie. Has some mature themes that newer movies tend to skip. There is a good reason in the movie that I feel is important for my daughters to learn.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Book one was good book two is great and book three well you have to read them you wont be sorry or able to put books down
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its minecraft... you don't much need to read a review to understand it. it performs flawlessly on Galaxy S3, my only complaint is that it feels like Mojang entirely just forgot that Minecraft Pocket Edition  existed. Its so far behind the pc version in content, I almost dont even want to play it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It's not going to win a Pulitzer, but I was on an emotional roller coaster durring the whole book. I could not put it down and when I had to I was quick to pick it back up. The plot moved and the characters were skillfully crafted. I feel like I have built relationships with these characters. A very satisfying sequel and I can't wait for the third installment.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I can not wait to read what happens next with Giddeon and Eva! Come on December release date!
B008XG1X18|4.0|don't get Me wrong, I LOVE pinterest. I'm on it every day. but the app sometimes won't load and won't open. if that was better than I would give it 5 out of 5 stars
1613821395|4.0|This book is largely plot-driven, full of mystery and action, but the characters are also brilliantly drawn -- complex and fascinating. Loved the villain! You have to slow down a little while you're reading it to appreciate the overly descriptive, melodramatic, 19th-century writing style. But if you can do that, it's very fun. Most of my book club really enjoyed it.
B004WN96ME|5.0|This is the best of the box set of Megadeth. I'm very very happy with this purchase and safely much people consideratad purchase this great item.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|It's the real Katy who fell in love and was heartbroken during her rise to stardom.  If you like seeing Katy perform live you will get a lot of that and all her hits.  I liked the movie but so glad I didn't go see it at the movie theater.  I hope it made Katy lots of money but I doubt it made a lot of money at the box office.  I wasn't expecting a documentary but it lacked substance.  It does tell you that being a rock/pop star isn't an easy lifestyle and it will take a toll on your love life.  If your partner isn't with you, even if you BOTH have money, then your relationship will suffer.  It did for Katy and Russell but I didn't see that one lasting in the first place. You can't control who you fall in love with but this one look destined to fail.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I love the colors are bright it challenges you and it has two different levels. I hope this company makes more for the kindle fire.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gideon and Eva have undeniable chemistry !  I read this book when if first became available.  It was recommended by my best friend.  I remember telling her that I didn't know if I could get into a character as much as I had gotten into Christian's (Fifty Shades).  Well, I did and I couldn't wait until the next book came out which was just recently.  I don't think the sexual encounters are too explicit, they drive home the fact that these two characters find peace within constant, passionate sexual experiences.  These books are an escape for me as I believe they will be for many. This Trilogy (2 so far) is captivating and sexy, I look forward to the 3rd book.
B00007KGCW|2.0|The DVD is now defective and will not play in any DVD player.  It worked twice and then after it is saying it is a unreadable disc.  Not exactly sure why it worked at first but I tried it in 2 different players and it no longer works.

B0058YPL66|5.0|In preparation for the current season, I purchased the 5-disc first season set,(the better to remember all of the characters, story lines, etc, my dear!) I was entirely satisfied! In fact, it was such a delight to watch the series commercial free and in a continuous stream...such great storytelling! If you are a fan of the series, or if you are trying to jump in this season, I highly recommend getting your hands on this set! May all your dreams come true!
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Jeff Lynne proves that nostalgia doesn't always have to be cheesy and manipulative. This album will make Rod Stewart think twice before doing another one of those ill-advised American Songbook \\"products\\". I won't go on too much, but give this record a listen. You'll hear a gifted artist paying a heartfelt, loving tribute to the songs that helped nurture him,before rock and roll totally took over.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|I've been a Diana Krall fan for years.  Then I got tired of hearing the same ol'.  What a pleasant surprise this album is.  It's shows just how broad her talent is.  This is good.  This is new.  If you're not ready for change just keep playing the old stuff over and over and over.  It's good too.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is a place I would love to exist in. The descriptive imagery is very inspiring. This will be a story to revisit for sure.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love the twists and turns of this book. It would make a great creepy movie if anyone decides to take it on. Will be reading more of Flynns books in the future.
B005SCSL56|5.0|This is a wonderful tale fit for adults or children. I read the actual book, decided to write a review and then get the Kindle edition so as to re-read it often. It brought me back to my own childhood (I'm 69+) and encouraged me to remember what it was like as a child. Wish I had had a fairy godmother like the twins did. I will treasure this book for a long, long time. He was so clever in doing this. I think a lot of us wondered what happened to the characters from the fairy tales we grew up with. No one really knows but this is as good a guess as anyone else's. I earnestly hope this author writes yet another book.

B008G12ERC|4.0|I guess you could say 2nd Law fits Muse's own chastened vision for our world.  The key is the second to last track, the near-epic 2nd Law: Unsustainable, where the news readers break through their pseudo-scientific stuttering to say something about \\"an economy based on endless growth is...Unsustainable!\\"  I take that to mean Muse wants us all to save energy, ease off a bit, keep everything in check, leave enough for the future.  I really enjoyed this entire album, yet ironically I think they've fulfilled their own no longer grand, less-epic vision.  Do we really want \\"sustainable\\" here?  Maybe I should award five stars for integrity (celebrity lifestyle matching their rhetoric); but with Muse I'd prefer them to let it rip, hypocrisy or not.

B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Album's books  are always good and result in a worthwhile message. This one was no different. It is definitely worth reading.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Who hasn't wanted there to be a well-done movie with several comic book heroes?  While we wait for a Justice League movie, this will do.  Storywise, it is not the greatest, but it has excellent entertainment value.  The one problem is how long it takes to get to the space invasion.  I put character development very high, but whenever you have a large cast all demanding their own time you won't get that much.<br /><br />But now that we have the assembling af the Avengers out of the way, I am curious to see what they do next time.<br /><br />I saw the film in 3D in a movie theater and I came away telling people they should only see it in 2D, that 3D added nothing to it.  So much of the first half of the film had indoor settings and there wan't that much light to make good 3D.  However, on Blu-ray, the 3D is a LOT better, and I would recommend people see it that way.  There are no shots of things coming out at you, but it provides good depth.<br /><br />Audio is excellent.<br /><br />The extras are on the 2D disc and are good: an original piece, a music video, and two behind-the-scenes pieces, as well as an audio commentary.  However, I still expected more from a title this big.<br /><br />A Blu-ray that is worth recommending whether you see it in 2D or 3D.
0316228532|5.0|I've read the HP series and I couldn't wait to see what new direction JK Rowling would take us,  I was not disappointed, the same masterful storytelling is evident.  I was so wrapped up in the characters and their lives that I find myself wondering what's going on with them now and I miss reading about them.<br /> I hope this is the start of a whole new selection of writings, as I  can't wait to snap up anything else this author cares to write.
B0098VXCR0|4.0|An entertaining retelling of a familiar story that doesn't shy away from its dark side. Good acting and great effects.
B002MJV7JA|5.0|Love this show! My package arrived promptly and I watched the whole Season in one night :) will definitely be purchasing all of the other seasons as well!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This has always been a Halloween favorite for me, ever since it came out.  I am now 31 and still love watching it every year and was ecstatic when I learned that it would finally be stepping into the 21st century with a Blu-Ray release.  It really is a family friendly movie with more than enough great qualities to keep the interests of the young at heart and urge anyone who has not yet seen it to give it a shot, especially now that it is out on Blu-Ray and with all the benefits that come with it.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Loved every minute spent reading this book. Think it made me a little bit better and a lot happier. Warm, funny, sad, true - everything you can ask for.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The suspense just keeps building in Book Two!  Some interesting twists and turns.  Book Two makes me want to keep reading just to find out what will happen, not just to my favorite characters but to my least favorite characters as well.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This doesn't sound like Diana Krall's other recordings, but that doesn't make it bad - just different.  Listen to it with an open mind and enjoy the top-notch vocal and instrumental performances.  I like Diana Krall's trio recordings of Nat King Cole material, but I also like to hear an artist try something new.  And I certainly prefer this to some of the heavily orchestrated things she's done in the past.
0062082353|2.0|To those who haven't read this book<br />1. This is not a sniper's traning manual.<br />2. It only contains a handful of Kyle's own sniping activities.<br />3. By no means one should compare Chris Kyle to Carlos Hathcock.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Book well written and very informative for an individual new to the \\"Gluten Free\\" world.  Would recommend this to have in your stash of information.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have to say, I was very skeptical before I read this book. Everyone kept telling me to read it so finally I did and regret not reading it sooner! It was way more than what I expected it to be. It's a beautiful love story and you fall in love with most of the characters. It's really not all about sex and I'm shocked at the negative reviews. I was so sad when it was over. After 3 books, I still wanted more. It made me not even want to star a new book! I would highly recommend it to people.
0385344333|1.0|I have been a faithful Lee Child fan since the inception of the Jack Reacher series. I can honestly say that this is the worst of the lot. It doesn't seem to be written by him or he is slipping. The book didn't flow, it lacked believability, and just seemed like an amateurish attempt at keeping the series going. I was very disappointed with this book.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I was totally blown away after listening to this amazing album which runs the gamut from the mid 1960's to 2011.  The music that was kept hidden away in a vault is now available for not only the fans to hear but the whole world to truly appreciate a voice that in one album spans 6 decades!  A true national treasure!  I had the privilege of attending Streisand's concert in Philadelphia last night and could only sit in wonderment at what she can command from her voice. Totally mesmerizing.  Babs, you never cease to amaze!
B00957T6X6|5.0|After watching the series on television, I purchased all of the books.  I liked the flow of the series, although there were some characters that were not as interesting as others.  I really enjoyed the series and would recommend it to others.  I hope that a sequel is on the horizon.
B009329ZF2|1.0|From start to end the movie is the worst I seen so far this year! How is it possible to make movies like this?! There should be a law against these kind of movies.
B001HADE00|4.0|For any Ratt fan this is a must.  I enjoy every song on the CD and believe this is the best of what Ratt put out.
B008XNPO20|5.0|Incredible album.  Easily one of the best of the year.<br /><br />Earlier, my review stated that the album didn't come with an mp3 download code.  I contacted Modular Records, and within several hours, they sent me a code.  Fantastic customer service!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like this game, only thing it could do better is usability. It was not clear and you can't find what and where the rules are, and how to play it.
B003TXSF5C|4.0|Interesting to read, but the center of the book is a copy and paste of other books by the author.<br />Interesante de leer, pero el centro del libro es un copiar y pegar de otros libros del autor.
B0026QCHOI|5.0|Thus movie always reminds me hoe great Jim Carey was as the batman and how robin fit great with the whole movie
B007V0Q8HQ|5.0|WOW just WOW!!!! this album is just plain amazing especially the deluxe!  it comes with 4 extra songs and they rock! they're going back and mixing their first album with their second for the best album yet!! if you dont like this album then you dont like the script cuz this is when they're at their best!!!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Let's just say that I was sick and tired of reading the impossibility of this by this book lol. I was visibly annoyed and times SUPER SKIMMED through their sex scenes because it just became SO BORING. The story line was neat...but I will refer back to a reader who mentioned that these books were written by two high school girls who had these fantastical dreamman image and everything came true LOL... totally agree.<br /><br />It is mindless reading and good for that. But so much of it is just plain unbelievable. And Ana started getting on my last nerves by this book.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that will touch the heart of anyone who views it.  I was moved from the very beginning.  With the exception of a misguided statement at the very end of the movie, it was one of the very best I have seen.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book gets your attention to make you want to read the next.... and the third is closure and much better overall as there is some type of plot in the third book. This one is just in the middle - I don't think there is much substance in this book at all.<br /><br />The way I see it - this is a GREAT mindless read -- as long as you are going for entertainment reading, this is great. The sex scenes are just so unbelievable that it becomes annoying...just my two cents...
B0077PBPJ6|5.0|A pleasant gift to watch oldies. These movies come with thought,plot and enjoyment. Unlike todays movies where all you need is sex,cursing,murder&destruction for a hit.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|So, I've been a KISS fan for many years and always thought the KISS ARMY MEMBERSHIP cost to much, but not anymore!  FREEEE!!! I just order this from the seller:  DAVIDA84  and after contacing them, they said this \\"comes with a Custom KISS ARMY Membership\\"...SO I JUMPED ON THAT DEAL!  After sampling the songs on AMZN, the sound on this recording seems a lot better than the last; KaBoom-Crap.  To me, this record (CD) sounds much like the Animalize era, which was pretty good back then so?  KISS is better when then stick to what's good and what they know works!  Can't wait to see what the KISS ARMY will be like.  At this price, a FREE MEMBERSHIP or call it a $10 Membership due to pricing is certainly better than the REAL KISS ARMY COST. I say BUY THIS TODAY!!!...no need to wait for the AMAZON PUMPERS to rip you off next week, when they start selling it for $25+bucks!  Thanks DAVIDA84 reasonable prices and always easy to contact!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is one of the best I have played on Kindle.  Great graphics and awesome game play.  The extras you get along the way keep it somewhat fresh and challenging.  Definitely addicted!
1401907725|5.0|These cards are a great way to find out the message that angels want to give to you on any particular situation you are going through. It's really incredible!!
0316228532|1.0|I just started reading Casual Vacancy, and I must say that so far I am disappointed.  I really don't know about the kind of person J.K. Rowling is, but I am appalled at her use of profane language and sexual situations.  It always frustrates me when a female author feels she has to resort to the kind of profanity many male authors use.  I was expecting a grown-up book, not an adult book.  I am certainly not a prude, but I am so tired of foul language.  There is a plethora of words in the English language to be used without constantly using profanity.  I guess I'll have to stick to elementary and middle school fiction!
B008G12ERC|3.0|I love Muse. I do, I really, really do. However, I do not love this album. What I have always loved about previous Muse records was the way that each grabbed me, immediately, and with few reservations. This record....not so much.<br />I still maintain that all bands/songwriters should be able to grow and develop and not put out the same record over and over again. If I wanted that, I'd just listen to almost any \\"pop\\" radio station in the US- almost every single song sounds exactly the same, and not in a good way, the sheer mediocrity of them all makes me want to scream.<br />Anyway, I really wanted to love this album, and maybe I will later, after more repeated listenings.<br />After listening to it thus far, I think that maybe \\"Madness\\" wasn't the best choice for the leadoff single. It really doesn't have an instant hook, to me. Truthfully, the first time I heard it played on the radio, my first thought was something like \\"what is this? this is awful!\\" Then the DJ announced that it was the newest single from Muse. I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time.<br />Another part of the problem is that I don't really think any of the other tracks would have been a better bet.<br />I rate this 3 stars, sorrowfully, and not without trepidation.<br />It is not a 'bad' album, but I have come to expect more from Muse. The whole album seems lackluster to me, and doesn't have the instant 'WOW' effect that \\"Absolution,\\" \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" and to a slightly lesser degree \\"Black Holes...\\" did.<br />It's not horrible, but it's really not 'WOW' either.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not as dirty as the previous books and has more of a story line than the first 2 in the trilogy.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|This is a great way to keep track of your task list on g-mail. I'he been happy with the program and use it on my Kindle and my Galaxy.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great game to kill time and kinda difficult on the kindle fire but overall a fun game the graphics arent bad either
B000O8OTNC|4.0|For the price and it being small and easy to pack, why not? I sharpened most of my kitchen knives and a few of my \\"Bigger\\" knives and it worked fine. Just get used to the size.<br />\\"Be prepared people.\\" CSM R. Clark
B007T99ENE|3.0|As an avid reader of British fiction, Sweet Tooth captured the cold war era and the 1960s paranoia of spying activity. Historical facts  seemed to be well researched. The book somehow flagged in the middle and it was difficult, as a reader, to keep interested. A reasonably enjoyable read with an unusual but not riveting twist at the end.
030746363X|1.0|The book in fact may have some good tips, however be warned that the language of the book can be quite foul and it's not something you want to leave around for children to pick up.  To me, the language was enough for me to put the book down and return it to the library quicker than expected.  So glad I did not buy it first.
B008N1LL42|5.0|I'd have to say this is more action packed than transformers. It keeps you at the edge of your seat. Great movie!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games to play. This is my default app when I'm a little bored. It seems like there is no limit to the new games.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who would have ever thought that a 55 year old man would get addicted to a \\"kids game\\" like this. I am absolutely obsessed! I keep shooting for higher scores all the time. Once til 5:00 AM. I love games with a strategic flair although a little luck never hurts in this game....<br /><br />Gary
B004LUS390|5.0|This is a great app with a lot of really nice features.  You can add textures, adjust \\"brush strokes\\" and sizes and create some very cool drawings.  Very easy to use and a lot of fun!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|First off, wasn't going to write a review but was INFURIATED by Amazon customers that rented/bought this and gave it 1 Star. Most if not the majority of them were customers that thought this was the Nolan movie version. This Batman Dark Knight Animated film is suffering from low to bad reviews due to IDIOTS that lost the ability to read the \\"Product Description\\" portion which clearly states \\"Format: ANIMATED\\". Amazon needs to adopt some way to Vote off reviews that are NOT related to the product itself due to the INCOMPETENCE of some \\"reviewers\\" ability to read and inform themselves of what exactly they're purchasing.<br /><br />Now on to the Animated movie. AMAZING!!! Having read the Novel I was excited to see this come out as the original Batman Animated series from the 90's did tease us with small clips here and there and gave us a taste of what it would be like to see the Novel animated. Now backed with outstanding performances from Peter Weller (RoboCop movies) who plays an aged Bruce Wayne/Batman and an almost exact frame to frame shot sequences from the comic books, it gave me chills. Whether you are a Batman, comic book fan or not, if you consider yourself a fan of good quality story telling and well done animation this is a great buy. Keeping this short and simple, lots of memorable moments that really stick out. Hearing Peter Weller's voice rumbling through my surround sound set up with one of my all time favorite quotes from the movie gave me goosebumps: \\"You don't get it son, this isn't a Mud-Hole, it's an operating table...and I'm the surgeon.\\"<br /><br />Already waiting to pre-order Part 2.
B007QRWXJG|2.0|I purchased this stream as I love Mad Men. Would watch it live but cable TV isn't in my media plan. That said, I have watched all 4 seasons on Netflix multiple times and in our internet age I am no stranger to streaming media content.<br />I have given this episode 2 stars for the following reason<br />-Poor Quality. Partially due to the size of my monitor (larger than avg) but still no excuse. Was very broken in the stream and I was not warned about the resolution causing delays. I did figure this out as I opened this episode onto my smaller monitor.<br /><br />Other than that- I love Mad Men and this product delivered in the content area. I think it's a great option from Amazon to watch TV this way, but this was a bad experience.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is a wonderfully spun story within a story.<br /><br />Patrick Rothfuss does an amazing job not only at explaining how his world of fantasy works but also leaves enough unsaid as a mystery to keep the reader engaged constantly. When I finally started through this work I found I could rarely put it down and finished the story in less than a week.<br /><br />I am of the opinion that this is a must read for anyone who enjoys fantasy novels.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This version of Minecraft is really old, like Alpha. There are some things missing that I find really important, like redstone, obsidian, buckets, and other blocks. Another thing is that crafting has some flaws. Instead of getting a three by three or two by two grid, you have a list of items you can make and how many blocks it needs. However, the concept of Minecraft is still really great.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was reluctant to read or see the movie. I did see the movie and had to read the whole series and the story was fantastic. Easy to read, interesting concept and characters and not a complicated as your average scifi fiction. Also not overdone with teenage angst like another teen fiction series.<br /><br />Only one thing i didn't understand was Amazon's pricing on the individual ebooks vs the series price. it was cheaper to buy the individual ebooks by about $2. So check out the prices before buying the series.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think that Jetpack Joyride is an awesome game. Halfbrick did a great job, even better than Fruit Ninja. However, there are some slight glitches like force-closing which need to be looked at
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this downloaded on my phone, PC, and Kindle. I can upload a simple note on one and have it on all 3. I love it!!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|These guys are such crazy good musicians. They have managed a perfect blend of catchy pop hooks, blended with a punk edge (characterized by Billie Joe Armstrong's raspy-yet-creamy-smooth vocals - how the hell does he do that??), driven by freakin great rock'n'roll musicianship - such accomplished guitar, drums, and bass - truly impressive. The latter is what always strikes me the most when I listen to a new GD album: they just get and better at playing their instruments as the years pass, and they continue to be real a rock'n'roll band - true rock'n'roll itself becoming a rarer and rarer commodity these days. Okay, enough ranting. Get it. Listen to it. Have fun.
0316228532|1.0|I pre-ordered this book because I (used to) admire the author and was eager to read her new story. I stopped reading about 1/3 of the way through. I feel soiled. This book is devoid of all the things I love about her previous books. It's like she set out to prove she can write \\"adult\\" fiction. One third of the way in, I have no idea who the protagonist is or what the main plot is. No love, no hope, no positive virtue of any kind. No striving against evil. Just evil and depravity.<br /><br />Everyone I know loves Harry Potter--80 year olds and kids. The audience that loved Harry Potter will hate Casual Vacancy.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Given all we've seen, it's hardly startling that Bob Dylan continues to confound critics and pundits at 71 to the same degree and intensity he has since he was 21. There's nothing perfect about his music; really, only Nashville Skyline could reasonably be described as a perfect album. If that isn't making a point, it is at least laying a track for what Dylan expects, wants, and conveys. He was decried when he took his folk sensibilities electric. What first appeared to be a novel anomaly, the story songs that seemed a trifle antithetical to his pungent offhand lyical expressions turned out not to be...Dylan is the best story songster this country has ever seen. That said, he's hardly abandoned his opaque and critical protest songs either. In either case, critics were vexed. Like Johnny Cash, he couldn't sing...until he did and could. Why would he choose... But that's the thing. While all but the top tier of troubadour icons have ether retreated from public view or resorted to nostalgia, Dylan still evolves in front of our eyes. The ability of critics, yearning to classify, at least, where he is right now in the firmament of commercial music - or even in the timeline of his own life - is repeatedly dashed. Who can blame that horde for being vexed? Yet it is a cautionary tale. Such vexation inevitably leads to bad theses. Take his latest, Tempest. I'd call it one of his very best. The nuances, the tiniest shifts in his vocal delivery paint drama and theater. His voice weaves in and out of the winding music, sometimes spotlighted by some congruency or irony between song, voice and lyric, but often floating on top; the visible scow floating on the changing, thoughtless waves. I have to think that metaphor would tickle Dylan. He's hardly pressing himself into any of the fetching and numerous molds he's offered. That's why his songs still feel so lucid, quixotic, verbal and vital in this latest offering. It's really an astonishing work, laughably prompting praise like mine and insightless judgements pivoting on the word \\"rickety.\\" That says to me that Dylan is still on top, still evolving on his own terms.
B007HGPBRC|1.0|I'm a big fan of Christopher Hitchens' writing so naturally I ordered this book, which he wrote while he was dying and knew it. Not only is it so short that it can be read in under an hour, but the individual essays do not make a whole. His rigorous intellect and wit are simply missing, which absence I do understand, but the publisher didn't have enough decent work from those final months of his life to publish. Shame on them for doing so anyway.
0385344333|3.0|If you're a fan of the 16 previous Jack Reacher novels you already know he's an ex-military investigator who drifts from state to state and invariably gets mixed up in murder and mayhem. This novel is no different.  It's late at night and Reacher is trying to hitch a ride on a lonely highway in rural Nebraska.  If his imposing size and demeanor doesn't already make it hard enough, his badly broken nose held together with duct tape makes it nearly impossible. Eventually a car with two men and a woman stops. Of course nothing is as it seems. It doesn't take Reacher long to figure out the woman isn't there by choice and there is an ulterior motive for him being picked up. There's a murder to be solved, a kidnapped waitress to rescue, a terrorist cell to overcome and an alphabet soup of federal agencies getting in the way. There's also the trademark female cop Reacher teams up with that helps him solve everything.<br /><br />I've been a big fan of Lee Child and his Jack Reacher series for years but I was disappointed in this one. The first 125 pages were confined to a car ride and moved so slow I had to force myself not to skim forward. I love a good mystery, clever plots, and political intrigue, but this one was so convoluted when I finished I had to go back and re-read a few places to figure out what really happened and who was really who.<br /><br />My biggest complaint seems to be the detour Lee Child has taken ever since Tom Cruise signed on to play Reacher in the movie coming out this Christmas. It's like the author is trying too hard to justify this terribly miscast role and he's doing it by shorting his books.  Jack Reacher is 6'5\\" tall, 240 lbs, with hamsized fists he's used in every book prior to the two since Cruise was cast.  Now size is barely mentioned, and there were no instances when our hero used his fists to get out of a jam, a staple of previous Reacher novels. For the second book in a row now Jack Reacher's size counts for nothing.<br /><br />It hasnothing to do with Reacher's age. That's a copout. Size doesn't necessarily mean machismo either.  It has to do with staying true to your character. Yes, Jack Reacher is intelligent and a good investigator and could solve crimes with that.  But for 15 novels his size has been an intricate part of who Jack Reacher is.<br /><br />It wasn't a bad book.  The plot was clever, although confusing, and by normal standards I would have probably given it a thumbs up.  But it's just not up to the Lee Child/Jack Reacher standards we've all come to know and love.  Shame on Lee Child for selling out. If I'm reading right the series is winding up. Unfortunately, it's going out with a whimper instead of a bang.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I must admit, I didn't think that someone could exercise for only 20 minutes a day and do much good in the way of inches or pounds. But I really believe I will get big results with this workout! Including warm-up and cool-down it's about 28 minutes, but wow does Jillian work you! I've been trying to do it faithfully as possible (every day but Sundays) and I'm only 6 days of working out into it...but I can see a visible difference in the shape of my body. I may not have lost entire inches or pounds, but I'm less....lumpy? My thighs have a sleeker shape and my pouch-belly is getting visibly smaller. I'm excited to update this review once I'm through the first 30 days!<br /><br />So, about the actual workout. I've only done Level 1, but I can say this. If you are a work-out cheater, this will not work for you. You'll get through the workout saying, \\"that wasn't so bad...\\" You've got to do the moves the way she does them, as long as she does them, and without taking breaks. If you do that, you probably won't feel like moving for the next couple hours. She does 3 minutes of strength-training, then 2 minutes of cardio, then 1 minute of abs and repeats three times. I try to do some of the ab moves during the rest of the day, since I need that most, and they only do a total of 3 minutes of abs. Basically, anyone can fit 28 minutes of exercising into their day. I strongly recommend this for anyone who feels like they wish they could spend a couple hours at the gym, but simply doesn't have the time or means.
0891419063|5.0|Sledge does and excellent job of relaying the detailed misery of being a Marine in the Pacific without getting too preachy or too caught up on the \\"why\\" of the whole situation. The fact that he and other Marines endured not only the combat but the extreme conditions without completely losing their minds is amazing. His writing style is clear and concise and he describes day to day issues (like how they relieved themselves, living with rotting corpses) not covered in other memoirs. I would recommend this book over Helmet for my Pillow. Helmet is also well written, but spends much more time describing their time on leave in Australia and what they go up to, rather than their time in combat and the conditions.<br /><br />Teenagers today should have to read this book to understand what men and women in their teens and early twenties endured and sacrificed for their Country during WWII. Most people will never know the brutality of a war like the Pacific, which (like Europe) was essentially fought by regular people from all walks of life.
030758836X|5.0|Absolutely amazing book.<br /><br />I'm lying in bed, reading, reading, enjoying her way with words and how excellently the book is coming together.<br /><br />I get to the middle of the book and WOAH!<br /><br />Big change. Plot twist? Plot Twister/Rollercoaster/Sidewinder. And it's 2am in the freaking morning so I have to wait until tomorrow to keep going.<br /><br />But wait! There's more!<br /><br />So you have yourself all settled in. OK, got the plot now. And SKID on the brakes. What? What is happening here???? And THAT is what makes this book spooky scary and makes me wonder how many people are on death row who shouldn't be. Or marriages that aren't what they seem in a BIG way.<br /><br />EXCELLENT book.
B009CPES4I|4.0|There is nothing compelling about this movie, other than superb acting and a small little self-contained world that makes you feel good.  The premise, essentially the outsourcing of the latter portion of our lives to a different country, may or may not seem a little strange, but what makes this movie so good is how it makes you feel.  The actors are all fabulous in their respective roles and somewhere deep in you, not matter whether you want it there or not, they touch a nerve that makes you feel good.  And, in this world, what more could you want?
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was an intense book based on an abused woman whom could not control her fears from her past. The story was based on what happened to her and why she lived in fear and how her daily neurotic  existence merged the past and her situation now. Definitely a horror story that you want to stop reading but you can't!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|If you read the first book, there is no way to ignore the other two. I liked the ending. It's worth it. Enjoy!
B0034G4OYA|2.0|I decided to see Hotel Transylvania because I love animation and a friend of mine was begging me to go with her. I don't really pay attention to actors and had no idea Adam Sandler was in it, but even if I did, I probably wouldn't have cared. I don't have anything against the guy, unlike a lot of critics damning the film. My problems with \\"Hotel\\" has nothing to do with the voice cast and definitely not with the artwork. No, my gripe is that this movie plays like a kid with ADHD on a sugar high who just drank three pots of espresso.<br /><br />It never shuts up. There is not a moment to breathe throughout the whole thing, not even during all of maybe three dramatic moments. Music is blaring, someone is shouting, things are zooming by, giant butts are farting-- there's always something ridiculous to ease any tension that might otherwise exist. The characters scream reference jokes while shoving your face in product placement. The whole movie felt like this to me: OMGMONSTERSWOWLETSGOFLYINGJUMPOFFHIGHDIVINGBOARDLOLHEBROKEAPARTTHATSFUNNYHAHAWHOFARTEDWASITYOUTHATSSOGROSSWIGGLEWIGGLEWIGGLE<br />ISURELOVELMFAOEVENTHOUGHIHAVENTHADANYHUMANCONTACTSINCETHEYSLAUGHTEREDMYWIFEHAHAHAHAHAHAWOWYOUREINLOVETHATSWEIRD<br />BUTOKAYBECAUSEYOUREMAGICANDTHATMEANSITSFINERAVEPARTYGO<br /><br />My God, the headache this thing left me with. There wasn't even time to laugh at a joke or appreciate the scenery because the movie would immediately pick you up, shake you and then chuck you into the next LMFAO reference. I remember laughing only once, during a very well timed and very funny Twilight jab.<br /><br />There wasn't really any plot or character development. Nobody learns anything. The daughter wants something and then she gets it. Dracula hates humans but then he doesn't. Never mind that their choices are now 'turn kid into vampire' or 'watch him turn old and die in about 80 years'. Because hard things shouldn't be in a kid's movie, right? They're happy with farting and Dracula rapping, and that should be enough, right? They're only kids, after all, and they'll watch anything, right?<br /><br />The bats were cute and the Twilight joke was funny. That's really all I can admit to enjoying about Hotel Transylvania. For what it's worth, my friend liked it and I think young kids probably will too. Personally though, I left the theater wishing we had just watched Paranorman or Frankenweenie again.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I have no idea how true to the book these shows are. This season becomes less about the walkers and more about the interpersonal dramas of the group members. The episodes repeatedly focus more on the yin yang styles of leadership and ethics between Rick and Shane, but the final few episodes keep it shocking and tense. Can't wait for the new season!
B005VPRF0M|4.0|This toy, like many Legos, is a lot of fun to build, and nice built, kids will enjoy running around the house making the sounds from both the batwing and the Joker's chopper.  The hardest part for the kids will probably the large booklet of instructions, but this is a necessary evil: the instructions are well done and clearly marked step by step, which necessitates a large number of pages.  All in all, a good buy.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The movie is flawless. I thought it was going to be Iron Man 3, but all the characters have great moments.<br />My favorites are Captain America, Hulk and Black Widow! But they all amazing and delivered good performances(Mark Ruffalo is the biggest surprise).<br /><br />Hawkeye and Black Widow were interesting and entertaining even if they aren´t as strong as the others, shame they are not included on the Blu-ray cover!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I enjoyed this game very much. Great graphics and story. Thank goodness for the hints button! Highly recommend this game! Worth the money.
0061692042|1.0|I have not read any other books from this author, nor do I think I want to!  It took me forever to get through this extremely slow and incredibly boring read.  I kept hoping and waiting for things to change, but, sadly, they did not.  I consider this book to be a waste of money and a HUGE waste of my time!! YAWN!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love the game at game rooms and when I tried it on my kindle it was just as fun.  I just wish it gave more details on the different coins and levels.  If I knew what I was going to achieve I would probably buy coins instead of just letting them add in as time goes by.
B007LB2B3K|4.0|The more I heard Volbeat on satellite radio the more tracks I kept downloading. I finally gave in and purchased the entire album and I'm glad I did. There are only 2 tracks on the album that are catching the skip button but this is simply because I had to look up the lyrics as what I was hearing made zero sense at all. For instance there is a line in the song \\"Thank You\\" which reads \\"Let's all have a beer you're all our brothers, sisters and our babies\\" and I could have SWORN I was hearing something along the lines of \\"you were right about the sister and their babies\\" which left me with a WTF daze of confusion. I am definitely getting on the Volbeat bandwagon a bit late but their music is actually pretty catchy. One should check out their previous work if they dig what they hear on BH:AH as I have and I'm finding even more tracks to add to the rotation on my tablet. New fan for sure and look forward to hearing more from Volbeat!

B0087HT36U|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. some levels were difficult to beat but were not impossible. my kids liked playing it too.
B0083GPDBO|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie.  I got my popcorn and plopped down in front of the computer for an evening of entertainment.  Unfortunately, I found myself getting real bored.  I paused it and went and did something more interesting.  When I completely ran out of other things to do I came back.  Amazon took away my privileges to watch the movie.  I have never had this problem with Netflix or Redbox.  Anyway I learned much from the experience. 1) Don't rent a movie about a bunch of dumb kids called \\"Chronicle\\" and 2) Don't rent movies from Amazon.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Not Harry Potter, completely different genre, but just like I did with the Potter series, I will eventually reread this book.  It is that good!
0375507256|3.0|I've had the chance to read a few pages and can see where this is a love/hate book. It seems like a series of short stories where the connections only come through as you go.  I will be waiting to read this in toto either as used paperback or library audio/E version.  The ONLY reason I can think of for justification of price diferential is the the fact that Kindle versions are held in your virtual library.  No matter what happens to your Kindle you can't lose the book - can't forget 'em on the plane, ruin them with candle wax or find them in the dog house. Is that worth three dollars extra for something you can't even GIVE away?  I'm only buying Kindle versions of reference books or classics that I'll read multiple times.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|so funny how such a simple game is so fun to play! Its like the real game...just cant get enough coins to want to keep winning and accumulate more prizes and puzzles.<br />only thing is when you run outran coins they want you to purchase more...don't like that. other than that its fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game reminds me so much of being at Dave &amp; Busters. just wish u was able to get more coins...
1476712042|4.0|It's hard to know where to start when it comes to reviewing Beautiful Disaster. This is the kind of book that readers have either loved or hated and I have to admit to enjoying every minute of it. If you want to read about a perfect and healthy relationship then this isn't going to be the book for you but if you like your stories with a lot of angst between two dysfunctional people then you'll be completely hooked. Whether you end up loving or hating it you are pretty much guaranteed to have a strong reaction to this novel and if you ask me that is the most important thing I look for when I'm reading a book. I want to have characters I connect with and care about - even if I don't agree with the decisions they make or their actions.<br /><br />Abby has moved across the country with her best friend America wanting to start a new life where nobody knows about her past. She is determined to be the good girl, the one who works hard, finishes her homework and doesn't spend her time going out partying. The last thing she expects or wants is to attract the attention of Travis - the campus bad boy, king of one night stands and boy every girl wants to be with. But with America dating Travis's best friend Shepley they are thrown together socially. Abby has no intention of being another notch on Travis's bed post and is determined to remain immune to his charms but Travis isn't used to being turned down. The very fact that Abby tries to resist him makes him want her even more and when a bet ends up forcing them to spend more and more time together sparks are bound to fly.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much about the story line because this is a very character driven novel, in fact until towards the end of the book the focus is very much on the developing friendship between Travis and Abby. Do you remember the intensity of your first relationship? When you couldn't stand to be apart for even a minute and everything was so new and exciting? Jamie McGuire has captured that feeling perfectly in Beautiful Disaster, thankfully my first relationship wasn't quite as obsessive as this one but it was just as intense!<br /><br />You can probably guess from the title that things aren't all plain sailing and at times watching their interactions is almost painful. They both have issues from their pasts and they both behave in inappropriate ways that cause each other pain. I'm never going to say that I agree with some of the things Travis does - he is controlling and has issues with a violent temper (I will point out that he never raises a hand to Abby in case that is something you're worried about) - but I also felt that Abby knew exactly how to push his buttons and at times was trying to provoke a strong reaction in him. That doesn't make his reaction right but I don't think her behaviour was any better. I found myself just as irritated with the way she constantly played Travis and Parker off against each other as I was with the way Travis reacted to it.<br /><br />When their relationship works it really is wonderful to watch but when things go wrong you'll find yourself unable to look away from the horror of it. In a lot of ways Beautiful Disaster works as a \\"how not to have a successful relationship\\" guide because I certainly wouldn't want to encourage anyone to emulate or accept behaviour like either Travis's or Abby's but that doesn't make it any less engaging to read about them. I think most of us are capable of separating reality and fantasy and I have to confess I had fallen for Travis in spite of his issues by the end of the book. I think this quote from one of their friends (I think it was Shep but I didn't make a note of who said it) sums up their relationship perfectly:<br /><br />\\"You're a godd*mn tornado! When you're happy, it's love and peace and butterflies. When you're pissed, you take the whole f*****g world down with you!\\"<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is an addictive read, it is a story that you will obsess over with complex and flawed characters who you will love and hate with equal intensity. It's been a while since I had such a strong connection to characters in this age range and I can't tell you how excited I am to read the sequel when it releases next year. Walking Disaster will be the same story but told from Travis's point of view (although it will also include extra scenes) and I can't wait to get inside his head and understand exactly what he was thinking during the major events!nd flawed characters who you will love and hate with equal intensity.

B00701L5XS|5.0|Great 3D graphics that animate and really demonstrate well how to tie a particular knot.  Knots are viewable 360 degrees to help you understand how things come together.  Knots are organized into well thought out categories.  Great search function helps a ton.  This app has been a lifesaver this summer as I learned to sail.  Highly recommended!

B0041OT9W6|5.0|This is an awesome book. I'm glad it was published! Its interesting how families in hidding had to live .Ive recommended it to several co-workers and family.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Fantasy at its best! An epic story comparable to the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. The HBO series has done a fantastic job taking words on paper and bringing it to Life.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely loved this story. If you want an enjoyable/ easy read stop reading this and get the book. There are many, more steps to climb.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I bought this because I felt that I had to read the last of the three books, to find out how the story ends.  The storyline was good, but about midway through the first book, I'd had enough of all the gratuitous sex descriptions.  I ended up skipping several pages of it at a time.  It was exciting and interesting the first ten times it was described in detail, but after that, it got old.  Because of that, I had to give it an average rating.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Awesome book that filled me with inspiration.  I was in a rut in the middle of  training for my first marathon when I read this book - now I can hardly wait to go out and run!!  Can I run 100 miles like the Taramura Indians - uh no - but my half marathon this weekend felt pretty good!

Good Intent is a fine song and a great video.  All of her work has an intensity that belies the snappy beat and smooth vocals.

0307730697|5.0|Loved this book! All of the human failures and super human acheivements of Adam Brown in an open and honest account. I have so much admiration for all of our soldiers but especially for the elite special forces. Adam overcame so much adversity to rise to be the best of the best. This book took me through a myriad of emotions. Rest in Peace Adam! Job well done! May God comfort and bless his family and friends!
0321544080|4.0|I am not yet read very much of the book but what I have read, I have found some really amazing tips and directions that really did help to increase my understanding of the subject and I consider them very valuable tips for sure. A great book with examples of how he got the shot.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|drops the connection on your iphone after only a few moments even though it has a full strength wifi signal.  It completely contradicts the whole point of having a baby monitor.  It was very frustrating to spend so much money on this product which you can not even trust is updating a current image of your baby.<br />complete waste of money....$20 monitor from walmart does a better job.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie for some reason. Normally I am not into sci-fi movies but this one just kept me curious throughout. I made a lot of jokes about it when it was over because a lot of the dialog just seemed ridiculous but somehow it worked out for a 3/5.
B005LAII0S|5.0|Sometimes you need a silly fun movie to take the stress off of the everyday.  This movie is that.  While it isn't a cinematic masterpiece, that was never the intention.  The director is associated with beautiful movies, great imagery and he sure captures that here.  While a lot of Julia Roberts movies tend to be serious, it was really nice to see her in this role where she had me laughing!  I loved her dry vengeful wit, it truly made the movie fun.  Along with a great cast of Lily Collins and Armie Hammer, they continued to add life to the film.  Then you add the seven dwarves to the mix and the classic tale gets a nice addition.  Again, its a fun movie, if you are in the mood to take a break from the mundane and just enjoy a fun beautifully shot movie, then I hope you will not be disappointed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this whole trilogy. With that being said, of course this is an ADULT novel. The love story is amazing.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|The boys from Knights in Satan's Service (KISS!) are back, full of face paint, recycled 70s licks and attitude, and, of course, stage theatrics. Monster is Kiss' 20th album in its storied and legendary career that has outlived and outlasted musical giants such as Vanilla Ice, William Hung and the fellas from the Free Credit Report.com ads. And not a moment too soon either, as the rock music scene in 2012 is really putrid when you consider that REM and the White Stripes have quit and gone back to mediocrity.<br /><br />What I've always admired about Kiss is their ability to let their makeup and stage theatrics, their real strength, overpower and overshadow their awesome music. I mean, without the tongues hanging out, the makeup and the wild costumes, Rock and Roll All Night would likely have been sent to Top Forty radio and forgotten within a week or two, three weeks tops! That is the story with Monster, not to be confused with the Monster.com site, because all the songs here would feel like they belonged on a B-side if you didn't imagine Peter Criss's tongue wagging with each cymbal clash and Ace Frehley putting on Gene Simmons' makeup.<br /><br />Still, that's not to say that there aren't diamonds in the rough on this CD that is almost as good as Adam Lambert's last album. Take for instance Hell or Hallelujah: When you listen to the Jonas Bros.-inspired licks kick in and the Halestorm-like drumming start up, don't tell me that this song wouldn't have been right at home on Kiss' debut! Or take The Devil Is Me, which is probably about Shannon Tweed. When you listen to this song and hear Ace Frehley's one-chord magic cut in and Gene Simmons' iCarly-like, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum bass kick in, don't tell me that it doesn't sound like this song won't be featured on next year's Kidz Bop 51!<br /><br />Overall, it seems that these Knights in Satan's Service (Kiss!) are back in rare form, indeed. I want to offer just a little bit of positive critiquing, if I can, though. If only Gene Simmons would learn to make his bass sound more like the bass sounds from Vanilla Ice's Ice, Ice Baby, I think he would grow exponentially as a bass player. Similarly, if Paul Stanley would learn to play even more one-chord pieces such as the late, great Kurt Cobain, then Kiss would be even more listenable than they already are!!only Gene Simmons would learn to make his bass sound more like the bass sounds from Vanilla Ice's Ice, Ice Baby, I think he would grow exponentially as a bass player.

B009AHWLHE|5.0|This how Capcom should do things, to make these cgi movies on the games, at least they don't mess things up and lie, like what they do with 6, etc.<br />Amazing, better than the last, there in plot twist, thoroughly  enjoyed it.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I will start out by saying that the book series is so much better than a film can represent, but since I am not reviewing the book, but the movie, I will stick to that.  The whole underlying of the film is teens killing eachother to survive in the annual hunger games, which keeps all the districts in check.  I hope that it isn't a spoiler because that is the main point of the story :) Jennifer Lawrence does an absolute amazing job of taking the main lead Katniss and bringing out her strong points.  Katniss has had to be strong to support her family, and that is represented really well.  Then you add a great supporting cast that adds depth to the movie.  But a lot of the time, the relationships that are formed seemed rushed because with a movie like this, you don't have much time to build relationships.  However, acting aside, the story is good, teens enjoy it, adults enjoy it and even elderly people like it.  But if you havne't seen the movie and want to get more out of he experience, read the book!  And if you would rather just watch the movie, just remember, its good for what it is, and its only part 1 of what will now have 3 more movies following it, and it only gets better from here!
B008VBYN80|2.0|this game is sooooo fun at first but when you get farther in the game it starts to glitch its because of the poorly made website gameloft live
B00914JWSW|5.0|Am I the only one in the whole world to really be super-excited that the great Yentl is allowing us fans to see her most intimate, private tapes?! I thought that America's best days were utterly behind it when I recently heard the masterful orator Joe Biden admit that the middle class has been buried under Obama for the last four years! However, with this release of Yentl's 11 unreleased songs, I just know it in my heart of hearts that the US is about to turn a corner...I just know...it!<br /><br />I have been a Yentl fan-boy since I first heard her mesmerizing rendition of \\"I Finally Found Someone\\" with Ryan Adams from 1996. Since then, Yentl's absolutely magical voice has kept me from hurting myself many times...that's how therapeutic it is to listen to the great Yentl.<br /><br />I'm glad that she chose 2012 to finally release her unreleased songs because it is only now that the U.S.--with its first black president (who actually is not totally black because his mom is 100% white)--is really ready to receive her songs.<br /><br />Didn't We is the kind of song that just makes you want to curl up in front of the fireplace on a Persian rug with your lover's strong, powerful hands massaging your neck, back, small of the back and buttocks (provided you have no stress ball on hand, that is). Willow Weep For Me is a song that rocked my world because it featured Lady Goo Goo-style sexualized lyrics and Kidz Bop-like vocals, which shows how Yentl is able to still show off her range as a supreme vocalist. Finally, Mother and Child brought a tear or two to the corner of each of my eyes since it seemed to be about Barack Obama and his hippie mother who sent him to live with his white grandparents, Ann \\"Free Spirit\\" Dunham. My soul is still touched after listening to Mother and Child 69 straight times.<br /><br />Still, I have to critique Yentl a little bit. I think that it would serve her well to learn from female vocalists who are better than her and who have been singing for a lot longer. To wit, I wish Yentl would adopt some approaches from Britney Spears and learn how to lip sync a little bit, and I also yearn for her to emulate little Jackie Evanchoo's low baritone voice somewhat.r a lot longer.

1449410243|5.0|I have been a long time follower of the oatmeal comics and I was so excited when I heard that he was releasing a book. Needless to say, this book completely lives up to what I've come to expect from the Oatmeal comics. Hilarious, fantasic pictures, and a surprising amount of content! I would highly recommend this to all fans of the Oatmeal and anybody who is just a fan of humor in general!
0385344333|2.0|Long-time fan of the Reacher series but this book continues the downward trend of The Affair.  Lee Child seems to be on auto pilot.  This book seems to drag on - call it suspense I call it a plodding plot.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've been a Reacher (Lee Child) fan since Book 1, but, like others, have been disappointed with the steady decline over the last few books, starting with Reacher's miraculous (and not satisfactorily explained) escape from an almost impossible underground explosion a few novels back. This latest effort starts off well enough with the usual meticulous descriptive narrative, building the suspense, before collapsing in a heap of nonsense derry-doing, worthy of a Saturday Matinee serial. Like Reacher's age, the books are becoming tired and stale and, I suspect, not even written by Child, but by a team of underlings following a basic plot outline. The final straw has been Child's decision, probably motivated by money, to select that Hollywood underweight, Tom Cruise, to play Reacher in the upcoming movie version. Can you imagine? A midget to play the 6 foot plus Reacher! Beggars belief.

B00914JWSW|5.0|First, let me start off by saying I am a long time fan BUT as a lover of music I consider myself picky -- even when it comes to Streisand cd's.  I purchase the vinyl record AND the cd of this selection of songs from her vault. I find this cd absolutely flawless.  From the songs to the packaging, everything was just right.  Her voice which is magical in itself danves effortlessly through songs like DIDN'T WE, WEEPING WILLOW, and especially on the I THINK IT'S GOING TO RAIN TODAY song.  I thought Bette Midler's version was wonderful but Barbra's simpler version is absolutely amazing.  All the songs are worthy of being on this cd -- a celebration of her 50 years of being with one recording label.  I can only hope that this goes to number one and gains her new fans as well as making her old ones very satisfied.  I know I am happy! Can't wait for the next one or two RELEASE ME volumes that you mentioned in your interview with Katie Couric and on the liner notes.
0316227706|5.0|I pre-ordered this book in May after seeing Seth Casteel's work on Facebook. It's amazing how he can capture each dog's personality. The underwater photography is amazing.

B004GCQ2WS|3.0|Honestly, if you have the \\"one love\\" album from David Guetta, you don't really need this album. I actually think that \\"one love\\" is even a bit better....
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I have always loved this movie since I was really young and watching it again just brought back some great memories.

0525953728|5.0|Even though I really dont read books about war, conflicts, etc. this book kept my<br />interest.  I knew that the Seals always gave their all but was totally proud and<br />surprised what they must go through for training.
B008CP92ZO|3.0|As a fan of Paul Rudd, this isn't his best or funniest movie, but it's a good movie that has some really funny moments and hilarious surprises.  At times it also has its \\"all-to-predictable\\" moments.  Overall, decent flick. 3 stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Exciting! Can't wait to read the next book!   Some of the story a little too corny..but overall good reading. Highly recommended.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|The books are pretty good. I like them more and more as I get deeper in the series, as I start really liking the characters. I think I will end up reading them though...as I have a hard time giving my 100% attention to the audible version, so therefore have to rewind often...It's my fault though; I watch TV with captions 100% of the time, so I am not surprised that I have difficulty paying attention. Especially since I listen to the books while at work. :)
B008QE9XD2|4.0|This wasn't exactly what I was expecting, as the previews gave the impression that it was a comedy, but still, it held to the same characteristics of what I remember as a child, seeing some of the black and white television shows of \\"Dark Shadows\\" as a television series, when my mother wasn't looking.  LOL.<br /><br />Though I don't remember too much detail about the television series story line, this movie really does portray what I remembered about the show.<br /><br />All around, I will watch it again, as it is worth watching.  The performances were done very well and they did remind me a lot of what I saw when I was little.  That, in a way, was kind of creepy, as Johnny Depp really pulled his role off very well.... almost too well.  LOL.<br /><br />If you watched this show when it was on television, you will get a kick out of this movie.
B004GP0OFG|5.0|I've got it and now I'm happy. Dreamed about this LP for many years. MFSL LP tells real stories about every picture.

B005ZUR724|4.0|Very reminiscent of Dark ages of Camelot, and World of Warcraft.  Great graphics, smooth operations, with quantity as well as quality game play.  Well worth the $6.99 investment.  I would highly reccomend this for your Kindle Fire.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I've been through thick and thin with this band. I've seen it all, heard it all, kept my faith through it all. All I can say is WOW! This might be up there with their very best! Anyone who would suggest this is their best of all time would not get an argument from me. It is that good! It is stunning from beginning to end. While I was happy with Sonic Boom, I am even more thrilled with Monster.<br /><br />Paul once again shines on almost every song. I am very satisfied with the lyrics, and Tommy and Eric truly give us their best. Tommy and Eric have each contributed one vocal track and they are both stellar, both very enjoyable pop-rock winners. I am delighted with my Gene on this CD. His efforts outshine his contributions on SB. On this release Gene is in top form. He sounds as if he is 35 again. Way to go guys!<br /><br />The energy from start to finish is unrivaled in Hard Rock circles today. You won't get this much fun in one package. My only complaint is this: itunes had Right here, Right Now on its listing for a month. It was one of my favorite tracks. When I bought this CD, it wasn't on there! What happened to RHRN? Big disappointment. Should have been a deluxe release with its inclusion and a hostful of interviews and videos.<br /><br />Bottom line: BEST KISS CD in decades. Buy it, you'll love it.
B00149C8BK|5.0|It's MJ's best hits. What else do you need to know? The man was a entertainment genius. Miss him :(
B008G8SFGO|4.0|After just two complete listens through the album, I'm pretty happy with this one. Tommy's guitar seems to be front and center, and Gene sings more of the tracks than I would have expected. Tommy and Eric both get to sing a song, too, and both songs are good. In fact, Tommy's song \\"Outta This World\\" is probably my favorite song on the album -- and that's not something I ever thought I'd say.<br /><br />This isn't the \\"perfect\\" KISS album, but it is 2012, and I'm happy that the \\"boys\\" are still making records.<br /><br />I'm a long-time fan, and I like KISS from the 1980s and early 1990s as much as I like KISS from the 1970s. I was also a fan of Psycho Circus. Sonic Boom was a bit of a letdown, but that was partly because of the 11 years between albums. With this release, KISS seems to understand what went wrong with Sonic Boom, and they were able to put together another good album...

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game! It keeps me focused & busy for hours.. Tryin to beat my previous time is insane! I have not played the social version, so i'm not sure what other reviewers were referring too.. you can play the timed game & just run it against the clock.
B005BOX7BE|5.0|Tv doesn't get any better a must see the series is fabulous I loved watching after purchasing from amazon prime
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read all the Reacher novels twice through and love them.  This one was a good yarn but a little shy on action and a little long on superfluous details, in my view.  Also, the banking premise which is central to the terrorist activity in the story didn't hang together too well for me.  While I'm glad I purchased and read the book, it was not my favorite Reacher story.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great time passer and kids love it too. I would recommend this to any small game lover.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you, finally found another series I'm hooked on. The creative storyline kept me reading all weekend and I'm set to buy the sixth book. The affordability makes it a no brainer!

B0006AAS5G|5.0|I'm very happy with this purchase. Work great and very fine box.<br /><br />It's a great watch!!<br /><br />Very ease to use, resistant, cool!!!
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|When I first saw this trailer clip, I didn't know what I would get for a movie since my son is only 4 1/2 and I didn't want to get a movie that was for an older audience.  We rented this through Amazon's Instant Video and saw it before purchasing it.  Found that I really love the movie and I think it's more for me than for him.  Emma Thompson with her voice talent for Captain Amelia is excellent and lends very much to the feel of the movie and the language is not just words, but well written in her speech.  When you watch this, you see a lot developing and at times emotions are high.  I don't want to give too much away in this review, but I do give it a 5 star for the creativity and building up of the major characters.  It's interesting how much kids pick up in the movie.  My son wants to know what happened to the star and what's a black hole?  Is it hot?  and lots more questions.  There are some teaching moments here and at least you can tell the good guys from the bad.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|The few funny parts of this movie were in the previews. Nothing else in this movie was worth watching. I was expecting more from the actress's in it.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Bought this book to read on my Kindle Fire.  Have never read the entire works of Sherlock Holmes, so I am thrilled to have this book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Unlike most books of this type which are too fragmented to make a good story this book reads smoothly and was hard to put down. You felt as if you were a bystanding friend and truly felt a part of the events in his life. If you ever wanted to be a hero you can see the \\"unsung\\" part here and how playing down ones strong points is important in establishing character.  Some have it and some don't this one does!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved these books! Christian and Ana's story is gripping and seductive all the way to the end. I hear rumors about a fourth book and cannot wait for it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this was a very good book and I'm very glad that they came out with a sequel to tie up the loose ends and the third book was kind of long winded... but good also of course every book have to have a happy ending
B00846REIS|3.0|When I first started reading this book, it reminded me to much of the 50 Shades series. I wasn't really interested in this story until half way through. Once the real drama started and twist and turns started appearing is when I was unable to put it down. When I finished this book, I had to go download the next novel right away.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was actually a pretty good book. There is a reason behind how the characters act and its not about just hormones.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|It does what it supposed to but since youtube is fighting downloaders you have to go through a lot of hoops to get what you want.
B001BR7CZW|3.0|The movie side was great, but the special features side didn't work. I tried another DVD player to no avail. Amazon had a great price and delivered as promised. B ut I guess I'm stuck with a defective DVD.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|This CD is just about as good as older albums that I have of Dead Can Dance.  I'm really glad that assembled again to do it.
B003Y3GTNM|4.0|purchased these to add to my beach collection and they fit the bill.  the color is a lot of fun.  the length of the footbed is a tiny bit long, but not a problem for getting out in the sand.  i would not want to try any serious walking in this sandal due to a slight bit of floppiness and mediocre support.  for the beach, it's a worthwhile purchase.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is a wonderful rock/soul album.  Released in 1970, it simply fell through the cracks, I guess at that time there was so much fantastic music being made that the DJ-types saw nothing worth playing here.  But now, 40 years later, listened to on its own, to me it's one of the best sounds I've heard from that era.  Guess the people in South Africa thought the same, thank goodness.  I'm so glad this music was finally rediscovered here in the U.S., and that Rodriguez, late in his life, finally got some of the recognition that he should have got decades ago.  I wonder what we all missed because of his dropping out of the music scene?
B005HEW818|5.0|I would venture to say this is one of the most hard-hitting episodes in the entire series. Socioeconomic status and what sort of benefits it provides -- these things are all very much real in this day and age, not only within America but also between the developed world and the not-so-developed world -- and the alien ship presented in this episode, with its different levels of treatment, is a brilliant metaphor for how we in the upper echelon of society tend to view the world (because, let's face it, we're pretty lucky). Really well done.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Writing a book review is hard without giving away any of the storyline. I'll just say the final book in the trilogy did not pan out the way I thought it would. It was so depressing and there were way too many \\"blackout\\" periods where Katniss would be unconscious and when she woke up the reader needed to caught up with everything that happenened. Prior to this trilogy I haven't read anything else Suzanne Collins has written so it may be similar to her prior work; however if you are like me I wouldn't waste your time. Just read how it ends on online somewhere or ask someone you know whose read it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The movie arrived fast and was in perfect condition. My husband and I couldn't wait to watch it! The first one got lost in the mail but amazon got another sent out immediately. I couldn't be happier!

0812992784|5.0|Joseph Anton: A Memoir<br />By Salman Rushdie<br />New York: Random House, 2012<br /><br />.<br />Reviewed by C. J. Singh (Berkeley, CA)<br />.<br /><br />The Roots of Salman Rushdie's Secular Humanism<br /><br />In his 636-page memoir, Salman Rushdie writes in detail about his years of hiding under repeated death threats issued against him by fundamentalist Muslims that began in the late 1980s, upon the publication of his novel \\"The Satanic Verses.\\" The memoir's title, \\"Joseph Anton,\\" is the pseudonym he adopted during his years of hiding. It combines the first names of two of his favorite authors Conrad and Chekov. The memoir details his schooling in India and in England (Rugby and Cambridge), the ups and downs in his four marriages, and the publication of his many books.<br /><br />This brief review focuses on the sources of his secular humanism. There is no chapter with the title secular humanism in the book; indeed, the phrase occurs nowhere in it.  The roots go back his father, Anis, who adopted the family name, Rushdie, after the 12th century Aristotelian, Abul Walid Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd (page 23). Anis, a Cambridge-educated Muslim lawyer in Bombay, preferred to raise his children in an \\"atmosphere of open inquiry.... Everything, even holy writ, could be investigated and just, possibly, improved\\" (page 25).<br /><br />Salman's mother, Negin, hired a \\"maulvi,\\" to impart the basics of the faith, but the children ridiculed him, and when the parents joined in, laughing, the maulvi  quit, cursing the infidel family (page 26).<br /><br />At Cambridge, Salman Rushdie studied history and chose as one of his special subjects Muhammad and the rise of Islam (page 39). Salman learned that at Mecca at the city gates stood the statues of three goddesses al-Lat, al-Manat, and al-Uzza. To secure their blessings, the trading caravans paid tribute to them. In Kaaba, there were statues of hundreds of gods, including a statue, al-Lah. Muhammad plucked \\"al-Lah from near obscurity\\" and became his Prophet (pages 41-42).<br /><br />Although at first the prophet worshipped the three goddesses, at \\"a later point, he came down to state that he had been deceived on his previous visit; the Devil had appeared to him in the guise of the Archangel, and the verses he had been given were therefore not divine, but Satanic, and should be expunged from the Qur'an at once\\" pages 43-45). Clearly in Rushdie's interpretation, the issue was the gender of these divine beings.<br /><br />Several years after the extraordinary success of his secular novel \\"Midnight's Children,\\" Rushdie drafted a new novel incorporating some of the above themes and submitted the completed manuscript to Viking Penguin. The publishing house consulted the legendary Indian journalist, short-story writer, and novelist Khushwant Singh (now 98 years old and actively publishing columns, books). He wisely counseled against publishing the manuscript, anticipating the offense it would provoke among Muslims worldwide (page 113).<br /><br />Evidently, the publishing house did not communicate Khushwant Singh's advice to Rushdie. The Satanic Verses was published; the publisher, no doubt counting on banking huge profits as from Midnight's Children. Khushwant Singh's prediction of offense was spot-on: bloody riots erupted in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and elsewhere, resulting in the loss of many lives.  The government of India was the very first to ban The Satanic Verses; the government no doubt counting on banking Muslim votes in the next election. In February 1989, the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a \\"fatwa\\" for the execution of Rushdie. When Rushdie first heard the term \\"fatwa\\" on St. Valentine's day, it was new to him. In Afghanistan, the ancient giant statues of the Buddha in Bamian were demolished. In Tokyo, the Japanese translator of the novel was murdered. In Oslo, his Norwegian publisher was grievously wounded.<br /><br />Rushdie's defense all along hasbeen that in his novel, \\"The Prophet was not called Muhammad, lived in a city not called Mecca, and created a religion not (or not quite) called Islam. And he appeared only in the dream sequences of a man being driven insane by his loss of faith. These many distancing devices were, in their creator's opinion, indicators of the fictive nature of his project\\" (page 75).<br /><br />After the \\"fatwa\\" was announced, Rushdie received immediate support from eminent writers like Norman Mailer, Paul Auster, Kurt Vonnegut, Don DeLillo, Gunter Grass, Amis Martin, Ian McEwan, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Later, more than a hundred Muslim writers from Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere published a book of short essays, \\"For Rushdie,\\" strongly supporting his right for free speech.<br /><br />With the intercession of Norman Mailer, William Styron, and other eminent American writers, Rushdie met POTUS Bill Clinton. Rushdie said to him, \\"Mr. President, when I leave the White House I have to go to the Press Club and there will be a lot of journalists waiting to find out what you had to say. I'd like to be able to tell them that the United States is joining the campaign against the Iranian `fatwa' and supports progressive voices around the world.\\" Rushdie writes: \\"Clinton nodded and grinned. 'Yes, you can say that because it is true. It should send a message around the world. It's intended to be a demonstration of American support for free speech and of our desire that First Amendment-style rights should grow all around the world' \\" (pages 403 - 404).<br /><br />At an NPR talk-in literary program a few years ago, a caller asked Rushdie, \\"Are you a Muslim?\\" Rushdie responded firmly, \\"No sir, I am not.\\"  The memoir makes it clear that he would not agree that he is \\"Islamophobic\\"<br /><br />In fact, he contests the neologism \\"Islamophobia\\" itself.<br /><br />\\"A new word has been created to help the blind remain blind: `Islamophobia.'  To criticize the militant stridency of this religion in its contemporary incarnation was to be a bigot. A 'phobic' person was extreme and irrational in his views, and so the fault lay with such persons and not with the belief system that boasted over one billion followers worldwide. One billion believers could not be wrong, therefore the critics must be foaming at the mouth. When, he [Rushdie] wanted to know, did it become irrational to dislike religion, any religion, even to dislike it vehemently? When did reason get described as unreason? When were the fairy stories of the superstitious placed above criticism, beyond satire? A religion was not a race. It was an idea, and ideas stood or fell because they were strong enough or too weak to withstand criticism, not because they were shielded from it. Strong ideas welcomed dissent....Only the weak and the authoritarian turned away from their opponents and called them names and sometimes wished to do them harm\\" (pages 344 - 345).<br /><br />Compared to one of Rushdie's  closest friends, Christopher Hitchens' views,  the above is restrained. Hitchens, of Jewish heritage, called Judaism, Christianity, Islam -- the three Abrahamic religions -- \\"the Axis of Evil.\\" Tempted to create a fresh neologism?  Abrahamophobia?<br /><br />The excessive details about his marital rifts and his self-exonerations in them make the memoir drag in places. But his intellectual honesty shines throughout. Unlike some other reviewers who accuse him of name-droping, I don't find that valid; Rushdie narrates his interactions with his writer friends, many of whom are famous. There's no crime in that.<br /><br />Eleven years ago, secular humanist V. S. Naipaul's books, \\"Among the Believers: An Islamic Journey,\\" (1982), and \\"Beyond Belief: Islamic Excursions Among the Converted Peoples\\" (1999), based on his extensive interviews with Muslims in Iran, Pakistan, and Indonesia, led to his winning the Nobel prize in 2001. Will Salman Rushdie's brilliant memoir that unpacks the secular humanistic critique of Islam lead to his winning the Nobel in 2013? He deserves it, in my opinion, not for \\"The Satanic Verses,\\" but for his Booker-of-Booker-winning novel \\"Midnight's Children\\" and other novels.f this religion in its contemporary incarnation was to be a bigot.

B000641Z90|5.0|I have recieved my DVD Finally-The First farewell tour and let me tell you it was incrediable and well done to say the least. The picture is perfect. The concert itself made me feel like i was right there with everyone  else!! I have been a Phil Collins fan every since Genesis and the man is awesome in his field. The special features gives you a sneek peek at Phils other side....his interviews are so inlightening and eye opening if you dont know him...it makes you feel like you do. I also got to see more of his humor in this DVD and believe me he is a riot!!! I love  it and would suggest anyone who have not seen it to purchase this to add to your collection really ...if your a real Phil Collins fan you won't regreat it!!!

B002UBRFDC|5.0|This is a wonderful story which has the ring of genuine insight into the contrast between European \\"civilization\\" and that of Japan.  The startling brutality of some passages is contrasted by the subtle thinking of the various characters. Another contrast  is apparent between the primitive unhealthy and dirty habits of Elizabethan Europeans and the clean, immaculate those of the Japanese. I really felt that I was immersed in The Japanese environment and language in reading this book.<br /><br />There is one negative comment I must make.  The repeated typographical errors are annoying. Is there no proofreading done in the preparation of this book? After all the price charged for it is not much lower that that of the print edition.

The voices are superb. There is not an idle moment. Read it. Listen to the superb Audible.com interpretation, too. It's a fantastic story and it will be curious to see what the movie directors do with it....I can't believe it was beaten out for a Mann-Booker prize.  One of the best, most creative books I've ever read.

0316228532|5.0|... and Bob's your uncle in J.K. Rowling's new universe.<br /><br />I really loved this book. It's true, there's no magic in it. Instead there's drug addiction, child abuse and neglect, and a variety of sexual misbehavior. But the voice is unmistakably J.K. Rowling's, and that woman sure knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />Just as the Harry Potter series fit into classic English genre -- two of them, actually, the boarding school novel and the fantasy novel -- \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is written in the tradition of the English village novel, which encompasses writers from George Eliot and Anthony Trollope on through Joanna Trollope and Helen Simonson of \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand.\\" And there's a little of \\"Major Pettigrew\\" in this novel -- which also features village prejudice against Britons of south Asian descent -- but the south Asians in question are a lot less saintly than Major Pettigrew's Mrs. Ali. No one in this book is a saint, in fact, with the possible exception of the character who dies in the first chapter, creating the casual vacancy of the title. Imagine a world where Harry Potter is killed halfway into the fight against Voldemort, and you've more or less got the set-up.<br /><br />So, yeah, every character in this book is deeply flawed, but few are outright villains. Everyone's life is more or less grim, but everyone also dreams of something better. The big question is whether they'll be able to do anything about it, for themselves or for others. Like the Harry Potter series, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is ultimately about life's big moral questions -- but it's written so entertainingly that you don't quite realize it till the end.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this book down -- I read it over a weekend, and I would have finished much faster if it hadn't been a really busy weekend. In a lot of ways it reminded me of Eliot's \\"Middlemarch,\\" but without the boring parts. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews; if you're a fan of big, chewy novelsand you like Rowling's writing style, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />ETA: I see that a lot of the one-star reviews come from folks who are shocked and dismayed that there is profanity in this book. Yes, people, this is a novel for adults. If seeing the F-word in print sends you straight to your fainting couch, you'll probably want to skip this one.

B000WEMH3C|2.0|Pro: For the life of the cover I did not find one speck of rust or damage to my grill from the elements.<br />Con: With the Florida sun beating on it everyday, it eventually stiffened and simply flaked apart.<br /><br />Overall: If you were keeping your grill even remotely protected from the sun, it would probably be a great cover at a great price.  Did this cover perform as advertised, yes. The grill is in amazing condition.  The issue was definetely from the constant sun, one day I pulled off the cover and it just fell apart. I do have to mention that we had a particularly rainy summer, and it didn't have any issues.  If the cover lasted a year, ~$10 to keep my grill in the same condition would earn it 4 stars, unfortunately it did not last a year.
B008KPDKAE|5.0|The movie looked great but I have to admit, I wanted to see it because it was shot in Michigan and because my friend was an extra in it! It's hysterical! Great movie-and btw-I bought it instead of renting it, and didn't even see my friend in it! Great stuff!

B004LQA6MQ|3.0|1 and 2 are SO good. 3 is kind of a let down. It was like they were all excited to use new technology that made the movie worse, not better.
B006OB3K56|4.0|At first one might think this is an excuse to show a lot of nudity and sex but once you see that Michael Fassbender (the addict) and Carey Mulligan (his sister) are in this picture you realize they aren't doing this piece because they have no other movie offers.<br /><br />Fassbender plays a charming and alluring bachelor who just cannot get enough sex as he's a sex addict. His codependent sister keeps leaving him messages early on  and he tries to avoid her but she shows up and moves in, making matters worse as she reminds him of their issues and thus do you get to see their dysfunctional relationship.<br /><br />The sexual scenes vary in tempo and style and tastes. At first one might think it's sexy but later on you realize it's a man with a really serious problem and then you're no longer feeling it. No pun intended. At times you see the pain on his features as he realizes he is going down a destructive path. At one point it looks like he's going to change but a failed love prompts him to return to his usual habits. And then something else happens and maybe he will change.<br /><br />The tale ends with the old question of whether the character will change or stay the same. I think that was the best they could do as they didn't want to make light on the addiction by just acting like he cured it in a few weeks.<br /><br />Interesting musical score of Old School piano music to balance the tempo of the film.<br /><br />Overall, a gutsy picture that went to a spot most people would fear. Once again, no pun intended.<br /><br />The budget for this intensive character study was $6.5M and it made a bit over $17M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus;  CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; THEME FOCUSES: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: early October 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.<br /><br />SPOILERS: there's an intimacy between the dysfunctional brother and sister. Notice that at one point he deals with her nude and then vice versa. I found it interesting that Mulligan's character would say she was sorry yet she didn't apologize when he caught her masturbating. Instead, she found it funny.<br /><br />The black woman was the main characters best chance at a real relationship yet when the sex became too intimate he literally just walked away and stared out the window. When she tried to appease him (thinking he had failed to get hard) he just made things worse by being distant to her kind gestures. The failure of that led him down a drunken path in which he got beat up and ignored his sister's low moment and plea for help and then found her in the bathroom with her wrists slit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an very good read from my perspective. I have read all of Suzanne Collin‘s novels. She is an inspiration for an aspiring 21  year old author such as myself. Praises for Catching Fire!!!!!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Okay: New producer, new engineer and new studio. You have to admire the lady for going in a different direction. I found the changes to be appalling. The sound is steely and sharp (typical of T-bone Burnett) and at times the instrumentation overrides the vocal. I listened to it three times, trying to like it. I failed. A major disappointment on all counts. I believe this comes under the category of \\"it seemed like a good idea at the time\\". In retrospect it was not.
1401324649|4.0|I never read Forest Gump, but I understand it is similar.<br /><br />What I loved about this book is how the protagonist handles all the problems that hit him in his life. A pragmatist to a fault, ready to take whatever comes without a moan. It made for both some great comedy and insightful twists.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is a great application.  I purchased it for $0.25 on my Samsung Galaxy SIII and Kindle Fire.  When combined with a streaming application, it is sensational.  Whether it is worth $14.99, I could not say, but it is definitely worth $0.25.
B003B02O7I|2.0|The Rainmaker, The Firm, Runaway Jury, A Time to Kill.....those are good, even great novels.  Those stories drew you in, kept you reading, anticipating and even rooting for an outcome.  Was very disappointed in this one.  I felt like the words were quickly thrown onto paper to meet a deadline or get a paycheck and nothing more.  Only reason I kept turning the pages is because I believed there had to be something more.  Afterall, it is Grisham we're talking about.
0618918248|4.0|I only bought it to have something for Richard Dawkins to sign his autograph on. I actually already listened to the audiobook version. I love this book because it is the reason I clearly see that all religions are bullshit. It took me from agnostic to atheist.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a basic case, but it works well and is easy to use.  If you have any questions about getting the Kindle in or out of the case, watch the short video on the product page (in is easy, out was a little less intuitive, but easy once watching the video).  It looks exactly as I expected it to, and works exactly as I expected it to.  Couldn't have asked for anything more.

B0041L0Z1S|4.0|There are many changes to this adaptation of Emma that mirror the book more closely and give more insight into the characters, owing to not being limited by a film's 2-hour time limit.  All these additions (different from the Paltrow version) I absolutely relished. Knightly, Mr. Woodhouse, The Eltons, The Taylors, Harriet, and the Bateses--all lovely.  The one flaw is Emma herself.  Subtlety, thy name is not Romola Garai.  Unfortunately, Romola is so clownish in her mannerisms, always pulling faces to a cartoonish degree, so distinctly modern, that it is quite distracting and stupid to behold.  Harriet acts more lady-like than she!  Emma should be the picture of ladylike manners--the height of Highbury society and refinement--she is a town patroness of sorts and respected and deferred to by all.  Instead, here she has the bad manners of a modern-day girl with no care for the exertion or modesty appropriate to the Regency period in which the character lives. She is very vulgar and shows no delicacy, no moderation, no refinement, no reserve that a gentleman's daughter ought to embody and be a model of.  She is openly ridiculous.  When Mrs. Elton rolls her eyes at Emma's flagrantly bad behavior at the picnic, you can't help but agree!  Gwyneth Paltrow did a better job of being elegant AND portraying Emma's imperfections at the same time: meddling, impertinent, misunderstanding, etc., with a heart beneath it all (Paltrow's Emma is less conceited than the book's heroine).  Romola Garai instead brings out even MORE impertinence and conceit than the book.  Romola takes the 4 episodes to bring you back to her side and she changes some of her worst flaws (sadly, not her bad acting habits)--I commend her because she pulls that off. At the end, I do believe she is reformed. BUT, it is so hard to forgive Garai for her over-the-top facial expressions!  She also has poor posture (she slouches and walks gracelessly), shouting or screaming dialogue, and even shouting &#34;Woooooo!!!&#34; several times at the ball as if she was at a rock concert. She even dances like a farmer's daughter.  The actress portraying Mrs. Taylor is a good example of &#34;acting your thoughts in a subtle way&#34; with small looks and slight expressions, rather than making your face EXPLODE as Garai does to convey the same thing.  Now, Garai has a few wonderful moments of purer, simpler acting, but then in the next scene, she ruins it again by over-acting.  It's too bad the director wasn't stricter with her--I felt that with more direction on what NOT to do, she would have been better.  If you can get past how anachronistic she is, however, you will enjoy this. I actually hated the series the first time I saw it--angry with Garai the whole time for ruining it.  The second time I saw it a long while after, I enjoyed it heartily, despite being aware of the problems with her performance. Besides Emma herself, the rest of the series is really stellar: from design and production value to script, ensemble cast, costumes, etc... I recommend this for fans of Austen with the thought that you might enjoy it more once you make peace with Garai's garish portrayal of Emma, or the second time around.
0670023329|4.0|I've recently been interested in Korean history pop culture I'm esp. interested in North Koreans who succeeded in escaping from the Stalinist regime.<br /><br />That said this book will give you more info on the dark side North Korea, than you'll ever get. The book is cut into 2 parts. The 1st part's about Shin Dong-Hyuk's life in Camp 14, a Soviet-like work where people-usually political prisoners are worked to death under very strict rules (of which violation of one usually means death). Some of the things that go there are too sick to say in this review- Shin himself ended up ratting out his mom & older brother who planned an escape attempt & both ended up executed for it- due to the rules of the camps which encourages ratting out people- even other family members for better treatment. Ultimately Shin Dong-Hyuk decides to escape along with another prisoner who ends up getting electrocuted by the electric wiring on the fence.<br /><br />The 2nd half deals with Shin Dong-Hyuk making it to China & avoiding getting caught by the police-who could send him back to North Korea, his attempt to find work & how he eventually ended up in South Korea & later America, & his adjustment to a new world which despite now living in freedom, he's still hunted by his time in Camp 14.<br /><br />As this book is written by a 3rd party (Blaine Harden) via interviews from Shin, it reads more like a bio than a memoir. It's also a quick read at just over 200 pages upon which you'll have a better understanding on why former President Bush rightfully called North Korea an \\"Axis of Evil.\\"
1469984202|3.0|Recommended by an enthusiastic friend, I may have approached this novel expecting too much. There were good moments, but the required suspension of disbelief was a little too much for me. Someone said: \\"To keep your reader turning pages, put your protagonist up a tree and throw rocks at her,\\" metaphorically speaking, of course. There's plenty of rock-throwing in this story--just one thing after another--but somehow it didn't \\"take.\\" I never felt real empathy or emotional attachment to any of the characters. That, plus the endless running up and down the different levels quickly became tedious (with all their technology, couldn't they have created, if not elevators, at least a series of dumbwaiters for the porters?). In short, I found myself hurrying to finish the book, not because it was exciting, but to be done with it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy so much. It's a great love story. Of course it may be very explicit for someone's taste but I liked it. I had a wonderful and relaxing time reading the trilogy and I already recommended it to my friends.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I love every moment of this disk. McCartney not only took a personal trip down memory lane but allowed me to do the same. These are the songs I heard my parents sing and it was a joy to hear Paul reprise them. It was a joy to hear Diana Krall at the keyboard. The relaxed feel of the album is addictive and enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was surprized how graphic this book was, but also how you really wanted to know where the story was going and how it would end up.<br />I enjoyed it.,

B003QP4NPE|5.0|I am picky about the novels I read because of lack of time. I came in the bookstore and I found this book as a paperback. No one really knew anything about the author.<br />I liked the description and plot so I started reading it.<br /><br />This book is what all the other great reviews say about it, and lot more. It's a superb high-tech thriller for anyone interested in conspiracy theories, high-tech, future, great characters, ideas, descriptions, and so on...<br /><br />Daniel did a really good job and I believe he unleashed something to the world that we might see happening very soon!!!! Quite scary.....

Thought the game started out good with great graphics. Until I reached a certain point not too far into the game where I could not apply one of the found objects to proceed (iron man with scale) - got fustrated and turned game off. When I went back to play the game it would not open due to an error. I do not recommend this game!

B002ZG4QB6|5.0|So sad Cliff Richard never well known in he U.S. - he's a hit everywhere else.  (Also a really nice guy - and women who have seen his photo as a 70-year-old in a swinsuit...look at his website.)<br />This is music from his first ten years (50's to 60's)) and the talented Shadows. Set yourself for that Rock 'n' Roll<br />including what even John Lennon called the first of England's real Rock 'N' Roll song, \\"Move It\\". Included are Shadows records even took #1 to take Richard's place - and many to hear in this DVD.<br />(Other music from Sir Cliff -such as \\"Devil Woman\\", \\"We Don'd Talk Anymore\\" and so many are available on Amazon. He sold 200 million, has many, many #1 hits.)<br />There are reasons he did not hit the U.S., but it is worth his talent.  A few DVD's are available (not his great 50-year-old celebration yet), but many CDs are available.<br />As a (long-ago now) dj, not being able to introduce his talent to friends was so sad.<br />So, begin with the Shadows and Cliff Richard with updated version of the 50's and 60's, and you might take a look at the long-list of talent still being sung by Richard.'s first

B00914JWSW|3.0|I believe these songs should have been released in a timely manner; when she recorded them.  I do not know why Ms. Streisand had them held back and only she and Sony management know why.  However, it's better late than never. I think that she did a wonderful job with the material and my favorites are \\"Didn't We,\\" \\"Try to Win a Friend\\" and \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today.\\"  The reason why the album is called \\"Release Me\\" is because they SHOULD have already been put out.  I would like to hear her with more updated songs.  She should look to Adele and many other of today's female singer/songwriters to cull material from just as she had from Laura Nyro in the 70's.  This is why I'm only giving it three stars.  btw you should give a listen to her son Jason Gould's debut album.  I liked that one a LOT

B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I never write reviews unless I have been taken.  This product does not work on wine bottles.  I've assembled some of the most complicated, massive mechanical devices made by man.  Devices of such complexity that I would rate them as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, with the most complex device on earth being a 10.  This glass cutter would be about 0.00001 on the complexity scale.  Forget the videos you've seen, forget the positive reviews posted on amazon.com (they probably were posted by company family members).  This glass cutter simply doesn't work on wine bottles.  Don't buy this product unless someone you know invites you into their garage and demonstrates before your very eyes that it works.

Maybe my phone is smarter than theirs, because when I type a word again, I get the same results every time.

B000XA5K4I|5.0|This movie is exactly as its title states. The movie is action packed from beginning to end. If you enjoy henchmen getting killed, and Paul Giamatti playing a bad guy, then this is the movie for you. Its silly and over the top, so if you're in the mood for heavy character ties and development, this is not the movie to watch. If you are however in the mood for a good ol' fashion \\"Shoot em' Up\\" then I suggest not reading any further and just adding this gorgeous piece of work to your cart. Seriously, stop reading this. Knock it off. You're starting to get on my nerves. Knock it off already! You know what, you're rude, you're a jerk, and I'm done talking to you.

B0087DFIYA|4.0|A lot of people have reviewed this film so there is really no need for me to do so, but I was so blown away by how much I liked it, I had to write it down. This is, plain and simple, a tough guy film. But it has a lot of smarts to back up the brawn.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Mel Gibson and a partner have pulled off a big heist but his partner gets shot and killed in the ensuing chase and Mel ends up in a bizarre Mexican prison. Corrupt Mexican cops steal the booty, a corrupt American official wants a cut of said take and the guys whose money he took want it back. This is a very sticky situation. He befriends a young kid and the kid's mom in the prison (like I said this is a bizarre place) and needs to do right by everyone including himself.<br /><br />That the opening scene here is nearly identical to the opening scene in \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" pretty much  tells you what you're in for, and it delivers the goods big time. Mel's character has been around and is not easily intimidated. He keeps his eyes open to get the lay of the land and determine how best to profit from the situation. Yes he's a criminal that has done time, but he only does bad things to bad guys. The friendship he builds with the kid and the kid's mother is contrived but you like it all the same because you like them. The bad guys are all sweaty sleaze who need to get their collective butts kicked. You love seeing Mel play these guys. He knows them and their types and he knows what to do to pull them apart. He spews out great tough guy patter. This is very cleverly written with a lot of great lines, and, like all good scripts, there are a lot of surprises. Some are big, some are small but they come with great regularity. The end is way over the top. You can't believe it for a minute but it's directed really well.<br /><br />Gibson has had his trials and tribulations as of late, and isn't the draw he used to be, but he does as good a job here as I've ever seen him do. The film is directed well, cut well and all the production values are of high order. It has a cool soundtrack and is just overall a good time. This is a guy flick through and through and it delivers great guy stuff. Film history is replete with these kinds of movies and I put this near the top.

B008G8SFGO|5.0|2009's SONIC BOOM was a good album but it took some listening to really grow on me. 2012's MONSTER, however, is a great album and didn't require any further listening. It is IMMEDIATELY captivating. While the producers and the production methods are largely the same as with SB, MONSTER is really in it's own league. The drums are bigger and tougher; the guitars, like SB, are reminiscent of the LOVE GUN-era; and the bass is full, and at times crushing. It is perhaps the best record that KISS has released since the original four members'albums released in the 70s.  It is a modern album  which isn't afraid of its roots. It doesn't try to be a retro disc. But it has all of the things that Classic albums have: great songs, catchy hooks, driving rhythms and easy accessibility. There is no filler whatsoever. There are no songs that you will skip while listening. There are no songs that you will not react to. It is simply a monster. You just have to deal with it.<br /><br />Where Sonic Boom, with the same line-up as MONSTER, felt like a testing-of-the-waters, this present disc is full-throttle without even a hint of apprehension. The vocals are strong and the lead guitar sounds less like Ace and more like Tommy Thayer, which is a plus since Thayer is a great player in his own right. The only downside to this disc is that the American version does not include RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. You'll have to get an import version for that song. Other than that, here are 12 solid songs with monstrous execution.<br /><br />1-Hell or Hallelujah<br />This lead-off track, and first single, was played during their recent European tour and on their co-headline tour with Motley Crue. Released last Spring, it was given to set the tone of what was to come. But don't be mistaken, as strong as this cut is, the album does NOT go down hill from here. HOH is a rocking song that definitely takes you back to the first time you heard the Love Gun album, but it doesn't leave you in the 70s. No, it only setsthe stage for one heck of a joy ride.<br /><br />2-Wall of Sound<br />As a song that would have fit well on KISS' REVENGE album, this track is strong and punchy with a blistering solo.<br /><br />3-Freak<br />This anthem to being independent simply rocks with a head-jerking groove that you will not resist.<br /><br />4-Back to the Stone Age<br />As you would imagine, this has \\"Gene\\" written all over it. From the thrashing tone of the bass to the crushing relentlessness of the drums. This is the sole song on the disc written by all four of the painted faces. It boasts a Neanderthal, primitive slogging rhythm befitting its title.<br /><br />5-Shout Mercy<br />This Stanley/Thayer composition has a classic riff with \\"whoo-hoos\\" that will not let you listen passively. It is one of the best tracks on the disc, and THAT'S really saying something, since they are all great.<br /><br />6-Long Way Down<br />The groove of this song is just irresistible. This is reportedly the second single from this disc. But really, ANY of them could have been. This song, though, is infectious with its great vocals and solo. And it possesses a swagger that is so obvious that it couldn't be more clearly stated if it were accompanied by a sign . Also in some ways, it shows roots of KISS' admiration for Led Zep. Great.<br /><br />7-Eat Your Heart Out<br />Beginning with a capella gang vocals, you might get the impression that KISS will go for an out-dated rock interpretation. To be sure, it does have classic components but it is NOT Classic Rock... it's just Classic, all with a blazing wah solo from Thayer.<br /><br />8-The Devil is Me<br />This song with a relentless rhythm says that the ONE who causes us the most problems is ourselves. The solo reminds me both of Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page. And the groove, as with all of the songs on MONSTER, simply WILL-NOT let you go.<br /><br />9-Outta This World<br />Thayer penned this song about a guy trying to find the \\"right\\" girl and it is catchy andcrunches from the first note to its last. It is a way better song than Tommy's first vocal song which appears on Sonic Boom. It has a classic guitar tone with great backing vocals and a classic flange finish.<br /><br />10-All For the Love of Rock & Roll<br />Eric Singer's vocal offering is a great classic-chord-progression song with a great vocal and guitar performance that will take you back to KISS' earlier Lps.<br /><br />11-Take Me Down Below<br />This Simmons/Stanley shared vocal tune has a marching rhythm that will FORCE you to get in step, all while you chant the chorus, almost like the cadence assumed by a troop on the way home after its victory.<br /><br />12-Last Chance<br />I read where one reviewer called this song \\"filler.\\" I don't know what he was listening to. This song has as much pump as any song on the disc. It may be the last song on the disc, but it is not the \\"LAST IN LINE.\\" This song only makes you wish that there were MORE than 12 songs!<br /><br />Theoretically KISS could take this album and play all 12 (or 13) of the songs as a centerpiece of their Monster Tour shows. Stick two or three songs on either side of these and voi la, THERE'S a great set list. NONE of these songs are slackers. EVERYONE one of them is concert-ready. But don't take my word for it... . LISTEN TO IT!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Key words: Classic (but not retro); Solid; Relentless and Forceful; Confident with a whole lot of Swagger.<br />If you liked SONIC BOOM, you will love MONSTER. If you weren't crazy about SB, you WON'T find a similar disappointment in this cd: It ROCKS and it rocks SOLID!

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I really couldn't wait to plunge into this historical fiction,but at 900 plus pages,it was rather disappointing. Mr. Follett  has done a masterful job in researching the history of WWII, as there is much information I was not totally aware of such as the attack on Pearl Harbor and the reasons that Japan attacked the u.s.  The politics involving the nazis,especially ordinary Germans who willingly participated in the ideology and the massive brutality,were all interesting.  The part about  keeping the aryian race pure so that any defective individuals were hidden and then killed was chilling, but most of us who are knowledgeable about the war know these facts<br /><br />The characters were likeable, but it was difficult at times keeping track of who was related to who and which side they were fighting for.  The peshkov family was, in fact, so convoluted I had to go back and figure out  father...son...illegitimate son and the mothers to whom they belonged.  The women in the story were strong and brave but hardly  riveting, and the narrative containing plots of espionage were kind of unrealistic.  information regarding the Manhatten Project did contain some technical insight that I thought was informative.<br /><br />All in all it was good but not great.

0316228532|1.0|As a fan of J.K. Rowling I was excited for her first adult novel. Was I expecting Harry Potter......no, but I was expecting a good read. Boy was I wrong. Rowling herself describes this book as a Black Comedy but there is one thing missing, there is not one thing funny in this book or even slightly amusing. With great anticipation the book finally arrived in the mail and I opened it ready for an evening of good reading. It has been a week now and I have only managed to get to page 56 and am calling it quits. In all fairness I did pick out random pages throughout the book and read them only to find out that it felt like what I had read in the first 56 pages. The characters, like the book itself, are flat and uninteresting, the cussing and the sex seems like she is trying to say See I can write for adults, except you don't have to be vulgar and crass to make a book good. Maybe if Barry Fairbrother had lived the book would have been better. Rowling also said that she didn't write the book for her fans but more for herself....maybe she should have had bound just one and kept it on her bookshelf and saved us all from wasting our money. If she writes another book will I buy it? Maybe after I have read more reviews and not just because she wrote it expecting it to be great. If I could ask her one question it would be will you please refund me my money so that I can buy a good book. My recommendation: Borrow from the library if you really want to give it a go, but don't waste your money.

The book was much more lavishly illustrated in full color than I had thought it would be.  This book is a valuable addition to any artist's library.  Excellent! I really wish I had this material while a student at the Art institute Of Boston.  I learned more from this one volume than from all the books I had while a student.

B006KSAPV0|5.0|I'm going to keep this review nice and short, because I really can't make it very detailed. The film is about plastic surgeon Robert Ledgard, who is still sorrowful after the traumatic death of his wife. He has become a hermit, trying desperately to create a form of skin that is impervious to injury. Once he decides to make a living human his guinea pig, his descent into deep psychological insanity begins.<br /><br />This film is incredibly twisty, and one must pay very close attention to it. It celebrates the film noir style, which is something that Pedro Almodovar has never really pinpointed in his films before. I went into this film knowing very little about it, and that's the way it should be. I was shocked, appalled and extremely engrossed in the many twists that the film holds. It's even more interesting during a second viewing, when you notice subtleties that make the film even more fantastic.<br /><br />Almodovar is known for his sweeping love stories of epic grandeur, which is sort of absent in \\"The Skin I Live In\\". He keeps his universal themes of family, trust, or lack thereof, unity and the struggle of his most celebrated heroines, in a different kind of woman than his fans are used to. Walk into this movie knowing little about it. It's pure excitement, shock and awe. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Grade: A
B0018LMZOE|5.0|Even 40 years after its initial release, the Moody Blues' 1971 album \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" stands out as a particularly strong and successful example of the band's work.  The Moodies stood out among British rock bands of the 1960's and 1970's not only because of their formidable instrumental proficiency (one got used to seeing, among an MB album's liner notes, the phrase \\"All instruments played by the Moody Blues\\"), but also because all five of the band's members were talented songwriters, four of whom could sing, one of whom recited spoken-word poetry.  They never got much respect from the rock critics -- as of this writing, they still have not been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame -- but their music has endured.<br /><br />\\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" was the Moodies' seventh album, and the sixth with what is now considered the band's classic lineup of drummer Graeme Edge, guitarist/vocalist Justin Hayward, bassist/vocalist John Lodge, keyboardist/vocalist Michael Pinder, and flautist/vocalist Ray Thomas.  The title of the album derives from a memory cue for remembering a series of notes along the treble clef, and the songs fit together well and showcase well the talents of each member of the band.<br /><br />The opening instrumental \\"Procession,\\" written in collaboration by all five band members, may seem ambitious, aspiring as it does to set forth the entire history of music in 4 minutes and 40 seconds.  Against the band's chanting of \\"Desolation!\\" \\"Creation!\\" \\"Communication...\\" (all concepts that will return later in the album), we hear a movement from primitive drums, to the chanting of monks, to a sitar, to a harpsichord, to a baroque church organ, to the Mellotron that is so strongly associated with the band's work.  Yes, it's a bit portentous, but somehow it works.<br /><br />A melodic electric-guitar interlude from Hayward provides a segue into one of the band's best-known songs, \\"The Story in Your Eyes.\\"  Forty years of continuous overplaying on classic-rock radio have done nothing to diminish the power of this song, one of the band's best.  Hayward's calm, measured vocal line complements well his high-energy guitar (his solo on this song shows how underrated he has been as a guitarist), and Lodge's propulsive bass line, Pinder's piano chords, and the band's ethereal harmonies combine for what could be considered the quintessential Moody Blues song.<br /><br />Ray Thomas's \\"Our Guessing Game\\" is one of his best songs, beginning with gentle piano and Mellotron, eventually energized by Hayward's electric guitar.  I've always had reservations about Thomas's work -- a good bit of it seems too self-consciously whimsical for its own good -- but this is a solid and straightforward song, with effective use of multi-layered harmonies.  \\"Emily's Song,\\" written by Lodge for his daughter, is gentle and sweet, like a lullaby -- acoustic guitar and cello work together well in this song.  No doubt Lodge's daughter Emily, forty years on, is still happy and proud to know that her dad wrote this song for her all those years ago.  And side one of the album (back when albums had sides) ended with Edge's \\"After You Came,\\" a fine example of the band's four vocalists working well together.  All four sing the verses together in seamless harmony, including one of my favorite MB lyrics -- \\"Come back to earth, for what it's worth/For you've been dreaming of a ceiling, not a home.\\"  And then, in a striking turn, each of the four vocalists takes a turn singing a line -- first Thomas, then Pinder, then Hayward, then Lodge.  Impressive how much of this album demonstrates an ethic of teamwork on the part of the band's members.<br /><br />Lodge's \\"One More Time to Live,\\" which was the first song on the second side, goes from a gentle flute intro by Thomas to pick up on some of the themes of \\"Procession\\" from the first side, with contemplative lyrics in which the speaker questions humanity's future prospects, except that now \\"desolation\\" and \\"creation\\" are followed by a long array of other general-concept words that rhyme: evolution, pollution, saturation, population, annihilation, confusion, et al.  One can certainly see here the culture-wide anxiety of those times, particularly with regard to environmental degradation and the prospects for nuclear war.  At least this long list of \\"-tion\\" words ends with \\"solution,\\" offering a hopeful suggestion that maybe we humans, for all our failings, won't manage to breed or pollute or nuke ourselves into extinction.  And indeed, a biblical forty years after this album was released, we're still hanging on.<br /><br />\\"Nice to Be Here\\" shows Thomas returning to his whimsical ways.  \\"A mouse playing daffodil\\"?  Really?  Sounds as though someone has read Kenneth Grahame's \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" one time too many.  But it's a pleasant tune, and the combination of flute, acoustic guitar, and high-register bass works well.  Hayward's \\"You Can Never Go Home\\" is a fine song that makes me think of walking long ago through Asheville, North Carolina, carrying a well-thumbed copy of Thomas Wolfe's novel \\"You Can't Go Home Again\\"; like Wolfe's novel, Hayward's song deals with the passage of time and the impossibility of returning to the safety of one's earlier life.  The song begins slowly, with acoustic guitar; then the Mellotron and electric guitar kick in, and the song picks up in intensity.  And the piano-based \\"My Song,\\" the tune that originally closed the album, shows us Pinder at his most overtly mystical, with that guru-from-the-mountaintop quality that often marked his work.  The song has a spacey-sounding break in the middle that combines breathing sounds with Mellotron power chords in a manner that made me think of astronaut David Bowman's trip through the Star Gate in Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968).  But it works as a song, and rounds the album off well.<br /><br />This release of \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" includes two bonus tracks.  An original version of \\"The Story in Your Eyes\\" makes for an interesting alternate take on this Moodies classic -- slightly different vocal delivery by Hayward, with more echo on the vocal, and less emphasis on harmonies.  And \\"The Dreamer,\\" a Hayward-Thomas collaboration, is a fine, acoustic guitar-based song with Thomas on vocal, a perfectly suitable note on which to close.<br /><br />The CD includes helpful liner notes that provide useful information regarding the circumstances under which the album was recorded, lyrics for all the songs except the bonus track \\"The Dreamer,\\" and a number of photographs of the band.  For any fan of the Moody Blues, this album is essential.

B0053O89Z6|3.0|The seventh season of How I Met Your Mother finds some major changes going on with the five friends.  Marshall (Jason Segal) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan) are expecting a baby, Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) enters in a \\"committed\\" relationship, Robin (Colbie Smulders) goes to court mandated therapy and then starts to date her therapist (Kal Penn) and only Ted (Josh Radnor) remains essentially the same, still on the hunt for the elusive wife.  Season seven is called the duckie tie edition because of a bet between Barney & Lily in which they bet that if Barney can recreate the meal at a Benihana style restaurant Lily will let him see and feel her pregnancy boobs and if not he has to wear a duckie tie of Marshall's for one year.  You can guess who wins the bet.  The season also features the return of the Slutty Pumpkin with Katie Holmes as Naomi the Halloween girl of Ted's dreams (who doesn't quite live up to the ten year wait in either people's minds) & Ashley Williams as Victoria.  The season is still funny, but not up to par with past seasons.
0316228532|5.0|I had not read any previews saying the book would be funny - and I actually feel awful for the readers who did. There is are funny moments, but these moments are like in life, painful, awful moments that are only funny years later. This book was not flat as many reviews claim, there simply was no dual at the end between good and evil. JK Rowling's readers will sort themselves out sooner or later and this book will get more readers who can review it without the word 'disappointing'.<br /><br />Casual Vacancy read like Huck Finn, where the action seemed arbitrary, meandering around the story. The real focus of this book is the foolish pride, vanity, and ignorance of the characters towards each other. Like Huck spending actual time with Jim, enlightenment comes slowly, as characters finally realize that Krystal is another human being after all. To their parents, Krystal represents all the evils of society that must be shunned and pushed away from their family, their town, and their tax-base.<br /><br />With themes of death, betrayal, and civic duty, the book explores territory that is dark, and unremittingly true. It reminded me of the HBO series The Wire for its long hard look at drug abuse and the destruction that is left in its wake. The Wire was bleak at times, and definitely enlightening. The holes left in the fabric of society because of addiction, withdrawal, and the failure of family are immense. It is a real eye-opener for all readers who do not have addiction in their neighborhoods or immediate family.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth reading - but not for all Harry Potter fans. Think more if you have ever heard of the The Wire, or if you've ever loved Mark Twain. Then this book might find a way into your heart. The real mystery is that with an author of this level of feeling and social understanding, why were the Harry Potter books not written more in this way? It would make more sense if Tom Riddle had been explored in this backdrop of addiction, poverty, and personality disorders.
B008ASLNN2|3.0|The action scenes were good but over all I was let down by the movie. I found the pace too manic and the plot weak.

B004LWZW9M|2.0|New Year's Eve is a by the book romantic comedy brought to from the same team that made Valentine's Day.  Instead of Los Angeles, the scene is NYC with the plot revolving around the traditional dropping of the ball in Times Square. Director Gary Marshall has assembled another all star cast (including a cameo by his sister Penny who delivers one of the funnier lines in the movie) who mug their way through a drippy plot.  The appeal to act in this film by so many great actors like Robert DeNiro, Hillary Swank, Hallee Berry, Michelle Pfeiffer and the like must be the campy fun they must have had on the set (the closing credits with outtakes and bloopers is funnier than the actual movie).  One example is Matthew Broderick making a brief appearance as a Mr. Bullerton (get it, haha) and hamming his way through his lines as a big muckety muck.  The film could be worse and is a harmless way to spend two hours.

0345803485|4.0|Well, now....this is my long overdue review for the Fifty series.<br /><br />A short background story:  I began hearing buzz about this book & really had absolutely no idea what is what about - just that I had to read it.  I am always on the hunt for my newest fiction addiction, so while at my kids' school book fair at Barnes & Noble (yes - GASP!!! - I said BOOK FAIR!!), I purchased it on a whim.  I had no idea what it was about or what I was getting myself into.  I just knew I wanted a new book - so there I was - happily prancing around Barnes & Noble amongst all of the fellow parents attending the book fair with my new shiny copy of Fifty Shades of Gray.  Whoops.  I'm sure several fellow mom's got a chuckle out of that scene.  But I digress...<br /><br />This was my first little tango with what has now been dubbed \\"Mommy Porn\\".  Was I prepared for what I was getting myself in to?  Nope.  Did I have a hard time putting it down?  Yup.  I loved the characters E.L. James created & was quickly enamored with Christian (weren't we all?) & his love story with Ana.  I really did enjoy the story (and yes - there really was a story behind all of the - ahem - other activities.) & the characters.  And as far as the \\"other activities\\" part goes - let's just say that my husband sure didn't mind that I was reading the series. ;)  I guess they don't call it \\"Mommy Porn\\" for nothing.  LOL.<br /><br />Was it the best written book I have ever read?  Absolutely not.  The repeated use of the word \\"crap\\" was something that continuously irked me.  There were many other little phrases & words that the author used that bothered me, but I still enjoyed the series & was able to overlook the fact that it wasn't the most stellar piece of literature I have ever read.  Also, as much as I enjoyed the steamy love making scenes, they did actually become a bit redundant & over-kill by the time I read the third book.  It could have been toned back a bit & I would have enjoyed the books just as much,if not more.<br /><br />On a closing note, I REALLY enjoyed the ending of the series where E.L. James wrote a passage of the book from Christian's prospective (ala Stephenie Meyer's Midnight Sun) & REALLY hope she decides to finish that story & release it.  A follow-up spin-off story of Kate or Mia would also be great. :)  Yes, the characters were really that good!
0385344333|5.0|Would not miss a Lee Child book on Jack Reacher.  The concept on Reacher novels is about the same; but the circumstances and happenings always has the reader on the edge of his seat.  Difficult to put book aside if not able to read all in one reading.
0062082353|5.0|Chris does an excellent job detailing his combat situations over several tours, the effects they have on him, and the toll his service has on his entire family. The excerpts written by his wife give an even more personal aspect of how much Chris and his fellow SEALs sacrifice to keep us safe. Chris' combat stories are not for those with a weak stomach, but some are rather humorous and some are downright sad. Overall, a great book, easy to read.
006197806X|5.0|Remember how I didn't really love Delirium? How I couldn't connect with the characters and found the plot kind of dull? Well, that is most certainly not the case with Pandemonium! I absolutely adored it!<br /><br />Lena was a much more interesting characters now that she's been un-brainwashed, but I still found it difficult to connect with her in the beginning. Luckily there were so many other spectacular characters to fill in the holes before the end, by which Lena had grown into a powerful heroine.<br /><br />The setting was drastically different, but in a good way. In Delirium, the world they live in feels white-washed and drab, whereas the world in Pandemonium felt warm and vivid and exciting.<br /><br />The way the book was written in two alternating perspectives was really different. It tells the story through two separate storylines that eventually meet up somewhere in the middle. The way they wove into each other flawlessly was beautiful.<br /><br />And speaking of beautiful, have you ever reading anything written by Lauren Oliver? Because she is a word genius. Her writing is perfect and delicious. It flows smoothly and effortlessly and perfectly tells the story. I would happily read anything she writes, whether it be another bestselling novel or a shopping list!
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|Overall, a great adventure. However, due to low budget effects, and Fairuza Balk attempting to sound like Judy Garland in a few scenes, it takes away from what the movie could have been. 3-stars.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I was fortunate enough to have bought the Omnibus Edition of Wool; a true cover to cover read.  And that's just what I did, read it cover to cover; helps being retired too.  Just bought Part 6; can't wait to see in which direction Mr. Howey takes the story; how did it start, will they combine, will they ever reclaim their inheretance, or any of the other dozen or so possibilities.  Thank you Mr. Howey for a very entertaining story.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Didn't think I'd like this game but it was an Amazon feebie, so I figured I'd give it a try. I really love this game. It's a good mind teaser, but not so difficult to make you want to throw your phone at the wall.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This camera bag holds a Nikon D50, Nikon D3100 (both with 18-55 lenses), two additional medium range lenses, and other misc camera items all in the compartment with room to spare. There are many combinations for whatever equipment you would carry as the partitions are completely removable and you can arrange them however you want. I'm sure a netbook or or Macbook Air could fit inside the front compartment. I have not traveled with it yet, but it will possibly be my travel and permanent storage for my items. I am not a professional or even an amateur photo enthusiast, but deem this a worthy camera bag. It's perfect for both me and my wife to take along our travels and snap photos with.<br /><br />There are mono/tripod loops with buckles on the side, I'm sure you could put anything there if you wanted, say another small point-and shoot bag with a belt loop. Many other nooks and crannies for misc memory or chapstick and what-have-yous. This is my first bag, and have no idea what I would consider appropriate for other enthusiasts. I don't think it's a speedy accessable type bag, I would have to take the bag off or have my wife grab a camera when it's on my back. It looks like there is adequate water protection, I wouldn't test it in the rain though (pack a folded up plastic bag just in case!). It's price cannot be matched, as an OEM bag is outrageous.

B008PNBU30|4.0|After the fan favorite \\"One-X,\\" \\"Life Starts Now\\" came as somewhat of a disappointment to some fans. Not everyone enjoyed the new things the group was experimenting with, and I see the same thing happening when I see reviews for this album. The only difference is people are focusing so much on Adam's lyrics and vocals. A lot of the complaints are that the songs sound generic and that Adam seems to have lost his edge. My response is this: you can't expect someone to be that sad all the time. I understand my best music comes when I'm sad or depressed, but I don't want to be in that dark of a mood 24/7 just for the sake of making better music.<br /><br />The reality of it is this, what made Three Days Grace so amazing in the past was just how deep and relatable the content was. So yes, to a certain extent the group has taken a minor step back in that category. You can't deny that Adam doesn't sound as strong as he has in the past, but isn't this where it gets interesting? Now that he's finally getting rid of some of his demons isn't this where we start to see what he's really made of? And not just that, what about the rest of the group?<br /><br />Everyone keeps putting so much focus on Adam like he's the entire band. Are we forgetting about Barry, Brad, and Neil? I don't know about you guys, but I've always loved Barry's guitar work. In my opinion whenever I felt Adam's lyrics started getting a little weak on here, that's when I found that the rest of the group started picking up the slack. You can't forget that there's three other members in this band.<br /><br />I'm even seeing some people go as far as saying they're becoming the new Linkin Park and that's an insult. Linkin Park completely changed their sound and you barely hear anything from Rob, Brad, and Dave in the new albums. So the people spouting that comment need to calm down. This is far from their best work, but in no way is this the equivalent of what Linkin Park is doing now.<br /><br />With all that said Three Days Grace still came through with a pretty solid album. After my initial listen I was kind of on the fence, but after the fourth or fifth play through I was singing right along with Adam. They experiment with some new elements and for the most part it works. And even though the songs aren't as dark as they have been in the past, there is still some pretty strong material on here.<br /><br />Honestly my biggest issue with this album is that my favorite songs on here are not only the shortest on the album, but some of their shortest songs period. The other thing is the cover. It just seems really simple and it feels like there wasn't a lot of effort put into it. I mean the cover of \\"One-X\\" was pretty simple if you think about it, but it was a perfect reflection of the album's content.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Operate,\\" \\"Misery Loves My Company,\\" \\"Happiness\\" & \\"Expectations\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - Three Days Grace is far from the greatest band on earth, but it's the accessibility of their music that makes them so enjoyable. And this album is no different. Whether you're feeling happy, angry, or sad there's a song in their catalog that you can blast and sing along at the top of your lungs. If you're a fan of the group than I would suggest you check this out. Even the weaker cuts have some redeemable quality that makes them worthwhile.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I found this book to be enjoyable . It was a short, fast read that left you wanting to know everything

B008XBHBX2|1.0|Great movie, terrible streaming. The Amazon server buffered the movie three times in the first 3 minutes and we had to turn it off. Hopefully this was an isolated incident and won't happen again.

0316228532|1.0|I had no delusions that The Casual Vacancy was going to be anything like Harry Potter. I was interested because I'm such a fan of JK Rowling. But man, what a huge disappointment. This novel was horribly boring. I got as far as page 132 and then couldn't motivate myself enough to pick it up again. I wanted to keep going because I'm such a fan of Rowling, and I was determined to finish, but alas I just couldn't do it. I would pass if I were you.
0525953728|5.0|I can't speak to whether or not this book SHOULD have been written.  There sure don't seem to me to be any details that terrorists could use to hurt us, as has been alleged.<br /><br />What I CAN tell you is that this book was fascinating.  Yes, the story of killing Osama is here in great detail.  But my favorite part was just learning how the Navy Seals operate.  I had no idea what was involved in the job.  The stories of their work in Iraq and Afghanistan are incredible.<br /><br />Great book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The author really wrote the book well. It was very interesting and a really great read. The end of the book has pictures of everything he's writing about which really let you get into the story.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary has almost every single word! <br />It os great for school, work, etc.<br />I would recommend this to anyone!
B0088EDMMS|4.0|This movie is bound to be a seasonal event if not a classic. My family watches this movie every October prior to Halloween. It has become a standard event in our home. As usual, Bette Midler is great, as are the rest of the cast. My children are grown now, so I recently purchased copies for each of them (3) so that they may continue the tradition.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|In every sense of the word. Vulnerable, raw, inspiring. I am a new fan and have to admit, I am blown away by this album. I highly recommend seeing them live, it is beyond any expectation you will have. So happy and proud to support these guys!

B007X98S82|5.0|I ENJOY HER FORMER BACH. THIS  SONATAS & PARTITAS OF BACH IS A JOY OF LISTENING. IN THIS ALBUM, SHE IS A LITTLE MORE PASSIONATE.
B008NW67E0|2.0|Three years ago, I was really getting into this whole traditional music revival.  Bluegrass, folk, alternative country, etc... It was all so fresh.  And along came Mumford & Sons, an arena-folk outfit out of London with lots of energy, the right amount of sincerity, and a totally fresh style.  I was so excited about it that I imported Sigh No More a month before it was officially available stateside.<br /><br />I spun that record so much that by the time I saw them at the 2010 Telluride Bluegrass Festival, I had all their songs memorized.  There, they blew me away with one of my favorite musical memories: a cover of \\"Hey Jude\\" with Jerry Douglas, Sarah Jarosz, and Cadillac Sky.  Every now and then, I watch the video on youtube and think, \\"Yeah, I was there.\\"<br /><br />Then they exploded.  By the time they became the Newest Big Thing, I was already ready for a new M&S record... And then they took almost two years to make one.<br /><br />So, you can imagine how high the expectations were for Babel.  I already heard four of the songs (Lover Of The Light, Below My Feet, Lover's Eyes, and Hopeless Wanderer) in Telluride, and I had the recordings on my mp3 player.  Most of the people I showed them to all had the same take: they're all kinda the same.<br /><br />This is the unfortunate reality Mumford & Sons must face: if you take three years to make a new record, especially when your popularity has skyrocketed in the meantime, you must make a choice between giving the masses exactly what they're asking for (i.e., more of the same), or, in the interest of art, doing something new and exciting.  \\"The same\\" was exciting three years ago; now there are other artists who are doing newer things and more exciting things.  M&S chose not to go with new and exciting.<br /><br />These are nice songs to be sure.  But there's nothing about this record that screams, \\"THIS is a vital part of your music collection.\\"  It's just a repetition of the same chords, the same strumming patterns,the same lyrical themes, and really, the same songs, for the length of the record.  Every time I've heard it, I found myself losing interest at some point.  The cover of \\"The Boxer\\" is the most interesting thing here, and that's just a bonus track.<br /><br />So, that's how it is.  Mumford & Sons becomes a pop band, albeit one that is still much cooler than all the electronic production whores and child-stars-turned-singer.<br /><br />Sometimes, I look at Laura Marling, with whom they collaborated in the past, and to whom they owe a lot of their musical ideas (and whence came the title for this review), and think that she's the one who deserved worldwide fame.  But then I realize it would be an even greater shame were she pressured to give everybody what they want.<br /><br />A final note about the sound quality: I have the vinyl version of this record, and it sounds bad.  The bass is way too loud, and it is hard to pick out more subtle sounds that come across nice and clear on Sigh No More.  If it's just the vinyl and the CD sounds better, it would be the first time I've heard a vinyl sound worse than a CD.  Particularly in louder parts of the music, everything just sounds flat and muddled.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|After hearing about this movie over anf over I finally rented it to see what the hype was all about.  Well............. I am SO glad I did.  It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. From start to end it was great!  Hope a 2nd comes out in the future.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Book was a good read but a little slow overall good book more of a transition to the final book.

B008LY9AWG|2.0|Too short and mostly the first chapter from his next book - and I NEVER read any of those teasers.<br />The stories themselves were very clever and well done, as is usually the case with MC, but not worth the price.<br />A \\"book of short stories\\" should have, IMO, at least 100 pages of real content.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Wendy Scott, fantasy author, [[...]]. Couldn't put it down, needed to find out what was going to happen next. Well written, tightly paced and I cared about the characters. Downloaded the second book as soon as I finished the first.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I have loved all the Jack Reacher books I've read, but sadly this one was a let down. The story wasn't gripping or particularly in depth and the book seemed to be over before I had really been hooked.

B008K3HRF0|5.0|Of course the Lorax has an underlying message about ecology, anyone who has read the original by Dr. Seuss will know that.  The characters are well depicted, the music entertaning and catchy, and the story, well, it is a Dr. Seuss Classic.  We enjoyed this entertaining eye-opening message.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I wasn't sure I wanted to read the book when I knew it was about children killing children but I gave it a try anyway.  In spite of that, I thought the book was written well and the content handled appropriately.  I won't go into detail so I don't spoil anything for those few people who have not read the book.  With that said, I thought the movie was very good but could have gone into a little more depth on the other characters of hunger games.  There were some things missing from the movie that could've given it more depth and insight into the humanity (or lack thereof) of the other hunger games participants.
B001250SAY|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read Steinbeck, but boy have I been missing something great!  I grew up in Oklahoma, so this story hits home.  I couldn't really call myself an Okie without the knowledge of our history and just what that name means to those few souls who are still alive that remember the hard times and forced migration of many of our people.<br /><br />Mr. Steinbeck illustrated just what happened when large corporations came in and took over the farms of the \\"little man\\".  My heart really identified with small time farmers being attached at the soul level with their land, something large corporations could never do.<br /><br />I wonder how things could be a rough and poor as the dust bowl days, I try to imagine the people of American enduring.  We have really become very soft, with even the poor having such extras that couldn't have been imaginable by the migrant workers described by Steinbeck.<br /><br />Never before have I been graced with the prose that describes the haves and have-nots in such a dark and colorful way.  The main characters, the Joad Family, learn what it means to be feared and hated by anyone who \\"had\\" something.  The people of California that owned land or stores knew the face of desperation, because they had experience the lengths humankind will go to in order to feed their loved ones.<br /><br />Being a liberal and a supporter of labor unions I felt incredible compassion for the Joad family and all the workers just looking for a fair days wage, but I also saw how the establishment could put a sterile (it is not my fault) corporate face to the practices of the farmers who would exploit the plight of the migrant workers.<br /><br />Reading the book one probably find it hard to think this was done to our own people.  Even though it is not right, it is easier to stomach such actions being levied upon outsiders who come and take our jobs, but can one imagine the same feelings towards truly desperate Americans willing to undercut each other to extreme measures just to put the very basic nutrients on the table for their families.  We have moved several generations from the likes of this type of desperation, which would tear apart the fabric of the crowded, interconnected and interdependent nation that we live in now.<br /><br />Finally, I thought it was amazing how the police and union busters used tactics of counterinsurgency.  I'm a military officer and found the subject very timely and see how well Steinbeck understood the strategies and how powerful the hearts and minds of the locals are to strategic success.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was the ending.  The final few pages were a huge downer, but maybe that was the point.  I couldn't grab onto any light or happiness to lift my spirits, but maybe that is just the point Mr. Steinbeck was looking for in the tale.t each other to extreme measures just to put the very basic nutrients on the table for their families.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|For those who have lived a life at the sharp end of the spear, this book brings home many truths. Truth number one: The men and women that serve our country are not perfect, but are human beings with challenges and shortcomings just like everyone else on this planet. Truth number two: These brave warriors are defined, not by their shortcomings, but by the incredible will to overcome them and serve at a level only imagined by most people. Truth number three: This book reminded me of the spirit of America and renewed my faith in the youth of today.  On my toughest day, when I struggle the most, I think of what Adam overcame so many times in his life and the role his religious beliefs played and I soldier on. Thank you Adam for allowing your story to be told. I will be forever grateful. Read this book.....it will touch you like no others.

B009329ZF2|3.0|Made by the same folks that gave us the TRANSFORMER movies, and given that this movie is similar in nature (mankind vs. alien machine) I think the best way to review this movie for you is to make some comparisons...<br /><br />The story is pretty good, the aliens themselves were no big deal to speak of as they were very similar to bald human males with reptile eyes and 4 fingers for hands (like the claws in those arcade machines where you try to grab a stuffed animal).  Their ships were pretty cool (but unlike \\"transformers\\" they had no personality and couldn't change into different things) and it was a little disappointing they fired almost ordinary bombs. There were some smaller ships that were fairly unique and deadly.<br /><br />The camera work was the same as in the Transformers movies, where in the heat of action they are in too tight and you mostly just get to see blur instead of the orchestrated/choreographed action (and I always hate when movies do that).<br /><br />I think the main problem with this movie is that you just don't really care about the main character - he's an idiot, lacking charm/personality and often intelligence/maturity. And truthfully, I think the blame for it is more the actor than the script. But it's a big problem for a movie when they can't get you to like the main characters. (The black woman who fires the ships weapons was very good, and so was the big black Army guy with the steel legs -- they were smaller supporting roles, but you like and care about them).<br /><br />Overall it was disappointing but not horrible because some parts of this were pretty cool, but it's not one I'd recommend or care to watch again myself. (And I'll think hard about watching another movie with the guy who had the lead in this as I expect his acting will always be like this)
0316212377|5.0|Isn't money an amazing invention?  Iain M. Banks puts true genius on paper, and I, a pea-brain automaton who could never reach his skill levels in anything, still get access to it just by going to work for a bit ...
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|Journalist Paul Tough writes skillfully,  with insight and passion, about research and programs to develop \\"non-cognitive skills\\" for low-income students to succeed--in school, college, and life.  His heart is clearly in the right place; he deserves plaudits for that. Unfortunately, Tough's book lacks coherence, being assembled from magazine articles published previously.  Further, he seems unable to resist presenting lengthy, tangential vignettes and fails to provide conclusive proof that his ideas will, in fact, reduce the achievement gap and increase poor kids' success in college.  In addition, direct links to many more of the sources in endnotes would have made references in his Kindle version easily-accessible online.  In sum, Tough's book makes a contribution by highlighting cognitive science--particularly, involving effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACE)--and promising approaches; professional educators and longitudinal research may connect the dots this writer draws.

B000JCSPG0|5.0|If you haven't seen this classic scifi masterpiece you really should...<br />If somehow you watched SG-1 without seeing this movie, you really should, just a word of warning, this movie in the cannon of sg-1 takes place in an alternate universe, where Jack O'Neil(played by kurt russell) went to Abados instead of Jack O'Neill(Richard dean Andersen). all aspects of these 2 universes are the same otherwise. This is actually explained in the show, in hints actually. So expect a completely different Jack than you are used to.<br />other than that, the sha'rei in the movie is so much hotter.

1469984202|2.0|Wool has potential. It really does. The concept of \\"cleaning\\" and the string of plot twists that follow it are (though sometimes predictable) truly engrossing to read. Howey integrated computers and servers into a dystopic science fiction novel with immense ease --- bringing with it a variety of new possibilities unlike many of those presented in previous works.<br /><br />Why, then, did I give this book two stars? The answer is very simple: The characters.<br /><br />I wouldn't be exaggerating if I told you that every character in the book with the possible exception of Holston had anger management issues. Every single one. And it seemed as though in every chapter one character or another \\"growled\\", \\"grunted\\", or \\"barked\\" at another while the the victim of such primitive attacks \\"trembled\\" in some form or fashion.<br /><br />And then the dialogue! I felt like if I used these descriptors and added to all of their dialogue words like \\"ratshit\\", \\"ratdamned\\", \\"rat hole\\", \\"rat out\\" and similar rat-related terminology, I could easily have myself created every character in the first five books of Wool.<br /><br />Unless cleaning somehow evokes unnatural obsessions with growling, trembling and rat-hunting that I've yet to familiarize myself with, I have no reason to believe the realism in attributing such words to more than two or three characters, let alone ten or twenty. Even characters initially exhibiting a calm temperament (e.g. Lukas) quickly came out with \\"I know this is ratshit\\" in the absence of any prior character build-up.<br /><br />I've honestly never come across a book with dialogue quite so pathetic. And though the plot is intriguing, I don't think I'll be able to stomach the sixth provided I don't become infected by rats anytime in the near future...

B009D5VNLS|4.0|A couple of reasons i enjoyed this film (1) I have red hair and films tend to show people with red hair as crazy, ditzy or slow and in Brave she was stubborn, strong and intelligent which was nice (2) We need to show girls that the female can evolve and save the day and be the hero sometimes and doesnt always need to be rescued by a prince.<br /><br />I love classic fairy tales just like everyone else but it is nice to see things changed up a bit sometimes. There is nothing worse than watching the same story line over and over and over.....

B0063IH60K|5.0|Wow... I love solitaire I use too always play with actual cards but playing on my Kindle Fire is so much fun and it is very addictive in a good way like passing the time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version of an old classic. Easy to play and it`s even better that it cost nothing.
B006YLGDQE|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD. I discovered this program on TV and loved it so much that I had to order the DVD. This is certainly a series that I will watch more than once.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|All of Follett's novels are at least good reads, and a few  of those are great reads. I think Fall of Giants (FOG) is a great read.  FOG's well developed characters are intertwined with complex subplots.  All painted on an apparently accurate historical European landscape.  Follett's  characters reflect the clash of: philosophies, social classes, economic classes and of course european Nations. My understanding of WW1 was limited to: millions died, trench warfare, mustard gas, Princip shooting archduke Francis Ferdinand, unrestricted submarine warfare (Lusitania), & Wilson's League of Nations.<br /><br />FOG provided me a much better understanding of the circumstances that led to WW1, and how the end of the war set the stage for WW2.<br /><br />What makes it a great book is that the characters were so vivid and interesting that I didn't see the history lesson until I finished the book.<br /><br />Now my limited 5th grade education is complete 50 years later.  Wow, who would have guessed
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just loved this sequel.  The first book had me not liking it too much because I found too many similarities to Fifty Shades and I found Christian Grey more likeable.  However after reading the second book (and it takes off right after the first one ended) I found myself falling more and more for these characters.  They think that all they have in common is a horrific childhood experience and sex but the journey of reflection of themselves and each other makes this such a good read.  We learn more about the supporting characters which I loved.  I can't wait for the 3rd book.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|The XX do it again, with another example of their powerfully restrained music. The vocals are just as bold and heartfelt as before.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Just what our Austin and Ally fans wanted!  Enjoying it with them in the van everyday!  Fun! Funky! Fabulous! We are thrilled!
B008C1O8CA|3.0|I wish green day would keep this in mind, it seems like as from 2009 they have been releasing a bunch of songs just for the sake of it' sometimes delivering songs that are obviously uninspired and end up hurting the album as a whole.<br />I am afraid the next 2 upcoming albums, dos and tre, are going to be the same. a couple of good songs here and there and a bunch of boring songs that belong in a rarities and b-side compilation. Consider UNO! Shenanigans 2.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its a great. bible my entire family loves it. it includes so many different aversions. I have to say that the ncv is my favorite
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just like at gas station but wait a long time to renew coins. unsure cost of more and also in-game ads
B00914JWSW|5.0|I downloaded the Randy Newman song \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\" as soon as I came across this new release by my favorite singer, actor and political activist and, after downloading, played it daily throughout August. That wonderful pairing of a great songwriter and the definitive interpreter of the popular American songbook gave me great hope for this album and I was not disappointed.<br />\\"Didn't We\\" was already a Streisand favorite of mine from the live Concert at the Forum album, but this version is even more beautiful.  \\"Sublime\\" is how she defines her favorite singer, Shirley Horn and sublime is how Streisand herself should be celebrated as well for songs like that.  The power of her voice along with the exquisite emotional range that she began to truly master in the 1970s is very much present here: \\"Try To Win A Friend\\" is the another excellent example of that. As for her Broadway chops, the classic \\"How Are Things In Glocca Mora?\\" offers a delicate, warm and character-driven interpretation of one of my favorite Broadway songs. Hearing the musicians applaud her at the end of this song shows how they also appreciate true virtuosity. Now after listening to the entire album, I'm off to my not-so-good seats at her Thursday Brooklyn concert, but I don't care where I sit. I finally get to hear her in person and I hope 3-4 of these songs are included in what should be a once in a lifetime event for me.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|A great series with superb acting and a great story. Also, the best Blu-Ray quality I've seen. Will certainly buy the 3rd season...
0140564349|5.0|I bought the hard cover version of this book when I visited Boston. My son had loved this when he was small - we used to get the book with cassette from the library. I was thrilled to be able to get the soft cover version from you for my granddaughter, who turned two on September 23. I hope she will love it as much as her daddy did.
B008ASLNN2|1.0|disappointing i was expecting more story, the fight scenes were tired. definitely a yawner.<br />if you're absolutely bore with nothing to do don't watch this.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is Ken Follett's second book in his trilogy on World Wars.  I enjoyed Winter World as much as I did his first one.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I hated to put it down.  Juliet became another Elizabeth where all Elizabeth's friends bonded with Juliet as tightly and emotionally as they had with Elizabeth.  I love picking up a good book that has interesting twists and turns, so that I don't want to stop reading it:-))
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I was told by a close friend that this movie was great and didn't get the chance to see it in theaters. After I purchased and watched the movie I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved it!! Great movie to be recommended and I will highly recommend it to anyone who likes the action and a little romance.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed the story of this navy seal. I have read quite a few war books, this is by far one of the best modern tales of Iraq and Afghanistan. It has a great mix of humor and death behind war.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|This is a really fun little film with great performances. Alan Alda is weak in some sections, but of course Ellen Burstyn is wonderful, as always. Everyone should own this little gem. I think it might be more of a woman's film, but I still think men can enjoy it too. Really, really great. Especially the jump forward in time, and watching both characters meet at various times in their life.
B009329ZF2|4.0|We were extremely diassapointed, the movie lost connection numerous times and we had to keep reseting. It took us over 3 hrs. to watch. We also have Netflix and do not have this problem. I will rent another time but if I have the conection problem again I want order from Amazon again. We lost numerous parts of the movie trying to reconnect.
B009CPES4I|5.0|We enjoyed this movie---as I said before \\"It is great for the senior group\\".  Many enjoyable parts for that age group---over 60-65 I feel.<br /><br />Acting was very good and the scenery was enjoyable.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I just got this today and let me tell you it rocks and it rolls. I am a diehard KISS fan and this one is a winner. Not a ballad to be seen and every song on it just makes you bang your head. They haven't been this rowdy in a long time. All the songs are hard driving and once I listen to it a million times and actually know the songs it will just get better and better. All my friends know what a hardcore fan I am and some know better than others. I have everything by these guys, yes, even the bad stuff and have found good songs on bad albums. There is no such thing here. I know I am repeating myself, but all of them are great. Yes, I highly recommend this one if you are a big-time fan such as myself. Go get it and rock out.
B005MWPW86|5.0|As you can tell by now, I am a huge Craig Ferguson fan. This book tells of his personal journey and how he came to live in the United States. He eventually becomes an American citizen, hence the title of the book. This book is funny, sad at times and tells an amazing story. If you are a fan of his or even like him a little, read this book. It is a great story. After reading this book and seeing his enthusiasm for  life in the United States, it made me stop and think about what a GREAT country we live in and how lucky we really are. Read it. You'll be glad you did.
B009K45Y62|4.0|Does anyone know if the bluray or dvd discs are zone all or not ? i m quite interest in the information.<br />a French customer
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has great graphic.If you like seek and find games, you'll love this one.<br />Keeps you busy for hours and when you're done you want to play it all over again.
1449410243|5.0|Well thanks to dumb people who can't grasp the concept of a PRODUCT review, this marvellous book is sitting at a painful 1 star average.<br /><br />Those who are familiar with The Oatmeal's content don't need much more info to convince themselves of purchasing this awesome work of art.<br /><br />For the others, check the oatmeal's website out and then buy the book. It's that simple.<br /><br />As for the review itself well I just got the book, according to UPS at least. It must be sitting at home somewhere with my cat napping on it.<br /><br />Since 20% of the book appears to be made out of comics I've already read I can assure you that portion is worth 5 stars. As for the remaining 80% well, I'll take a wild stab in the dark and assume it's just equally as good. Yep, I just did that! Gave away a 5 stars rating on something I haven't read yet and bashed people misunderstanding the concept of reviews in the same review. Take that!<br /><br />Enjoy the book, buy it, it's great and while you're at it, grab a copy of his other book (5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth) if you haven't already it's great too. Warning: May contain words and pictures.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|great machine. i have told my mates about the greatness of it and the have brought one each.<br />10/10 for everything about it great job
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved every second of it.  so many emotions to go through while reading it. One moment Iwas angry the next elated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this bible app it helps me with my classes at church, helps me to make notes, get notes from our pastor, read the bible where I go, etc. Its become a wounderful tool to help grow more in my chirstian walk.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Oddly addicting and enjoyable. definitely a way to waste time on a quiet evening or while waiting at the doctors office.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|No problems found by me. I was able to do the same things a on the desktop. Very pleased customer!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Enjoyed the sexual part, but would have liked the plot to over ride a little more.  Must say that each book opened up the plot more making me want to read on.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very addicting game. simple play. the only thing I wish the coin walls stayed longer and the coins regenerated quicker.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|One of the best reading stories i've read about SEAL ops. I recommend it to anyone interested in special ops, history, or just plain guts and determination
B00846REIS|4.0|Book was not as good as Fifty Shades of Gray, but was a very good book Glad I prurchased it, and will purchase the next book Deeper Into You.<br />Thank you,<br />Susan Robinson
B004BSFC46|5.0|my baby loves the colors and how it rattles...this is a must have for baby learning about hands and feet.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book!! It was very refreshing! Will read 2nd book from Travis point of view next year! Very good writing!
B000S9C8M6|4.0|Epic vocals from one of the best lead singers to be with Sirenia. Love the sound of this album, for those who don't like a lot of screaming this is a great album.
0525953728|5.0|This book is an amazing read in my opinion. I am a military enthusiast, with my family being deeply involved in the armed forces and myself being involved. With that being said this is not a \\"SECRETS EXPOSED\\" book, instead the author lets you know what it is like in the DEVGRU (Aka: Seal Team Six). Some things I did not know of and I do love reading peoples adventures that shaped their life. He tells a great story with such detail that it plays like a movie in your mind. Great read and I HIGHLY recommend it.
B005YVTHT0|5.0|I use this wheel to play F1 2011, F1 2012, GTR2, rfactor, etc. I know force feedback is missing, but still this wheel is amazing for what it does... My Main wheel's are Fanatec CSR and G27, but when I am tried from long day, I just use this wheel lying on my bed playing F1 2012... Its is also a great to-go wheel if you travel and play on your laptop....<br /><br />I love it....
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a fantastic book about World War II.  Ken Follett has done a great job of researching all the major battles, strategies and the human saga of that time, and incorporated it into the book.  I have been waiting for it to come out for some time, after finishing The Fall of Giants, about World War I.
B009329ZF2|4.0|good movie worth the watch, it kept me engaged and never bored. Acting was good and the special effects were top notch.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I liked that this game is pretty much like the computer version. The ads can be annoying but are easy to rid of. Thanks for allowing me to goof off at work. ;)
B002U3CCKQ|2.0|Disappointing!I really enjoyed Gone Girl and decided to try another book by Gillian Flynn but I struggled to finish and a few times thought about leaving it aside.I probably should have!
B006E2VTG2|5.0|Great movie. Lots of surprises. Interesting from the start. Zoe Saldana is always great on screen, no matter the role. Great supporting cast. This was a must for my library.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Having seen this title on the Best Seller list for several weeks, I was excited to take it on vacation. I liked the way each chapter flipped between the husband and the wife. I waffled between favoring one partner or the other as the story progressed. About half way through, I even applauded the author's clever way of tricking this reader. But shortly after the mid-way point, things really slowed down and I just wanted to hurry and get to the end. THAT was certainly a disappointment!After all that drama, I expected a much more definitive conclusion. It almost seemed like the deadline snuck up on the author. Glad I checked it off my list, but didn't share it with anyone.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It was a good movie, sure, but it lacked a lot of what the book provided to connect you with the characters and the story itself.  After having read the actual book, it felt like I was watching the Cliff Notes video version.  Empty, quick, clipped...without much of the flesh of the novel that brought you to care what happened in the story any more than a few pretty faces and familiar actors can.<br /><br />That happens, especially this last decade or two (corny or not, at least 80's movies put a lot of effort into character and plot development).  It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't amazing either.  As I said, perhaps my expectations both from reading the book and hearing the reviews, were a bit higher than they needed to be.
B0079XNWQA|3.0|this was bought after we saw him on the today show--it seems that he is really gifted as a writer and a singer, but these were not his best to us. we want to give him another opportunity and buy another one of his albums. he has not been in the open too much for the last few years. maybe he just wanted a hiatus to recoup before his new songs appear. we like his style very much.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!! THIS IS ONE OF PAULS' GREATEST ALBUMS, IN  MY HUMBLE OPINION.<br />BUY IT! IT IS WORTH EVERY CENT...
B008XG1X18|2.0|love the app, when it works. 8 times out of 10 it won't open the first time and I have to force quit and try again. please fix!
B00005YW4H|2.0|The voice, of course, is impeccable but the music is so bad...I had anticipated jazz accompaniment for Nora but it was a blah, non- jazz group that ruined it for me. I will not listen to it. Wish l could exchange it. Will buy more of Nora but be careful with whom she is singing.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I'll start out with the extras, since everyone has already talked about the film. As for the 6 alternate scenes, all 15 minutes were fun to watch. I think the only scene completely dropped was the one where those two guys that got lost on the alien ship, find the snake-like shedded skin. The alternate scenes were either slightly longer versions of the original scenes (like the Christmas tree), or completely rewritten scenes (like the sex scene, when Noomi gets pregnant with an alien.) The 5.1 mix was well done, however the mixers played bizarre games with the dynamics. Since Prometheus is a \\"rock movie\\", you have to play it LOUD. I have 15\\" Woofers, and they couldnt reproduce the Prometheus' lift-off sound without distorted rumbling. If you dont play this soundtrack thru a fairly good Home Theater sound system, I'm afraid you'll get a lot of distortion during the loud portions of the film. (The storm, the liftoff, orchestral swells, etc.)<br /><br />As for the film itself, visually its simply stunning. The overlay of intricate CGI provides the alien ship an oppulent, fairy tale quality. However, the Prometheus ship is all clean lines and white walls. Quite the opposit from the first Alien movie's earth ship, with its dark, threatening, industrial design. The Alien space ship in PROMETHEUS, is hands down the creepiest, most realistic depliction of an Alien craft ever created on film. In that sense, Ridley Scott surpased his masterpeice, ALIEN. But the visuals at times are so intricate and overlayered they confuse the eye. And the plot does the same--confuse and overwhelm. Just how many DIFFERENT aliens exist in this film? How many forms does each alien morph thru? How many cast members got infected this time? Four? Add to that the infected Alien, plus the dead aliens that were infected 2000 years ago. You need a flow chart to figure out whats going on.<br /><br />Apparently the complex plot sets up the next two films. That's good to know. Maybe we'll find out why that Alien drinks acid and melts at the beginning of the movie. When all's said and done, PROMETHEUS is a complex, visually stunning cinematic achievement. I cant place it at the same level of ALIEN, but only \\"2001\\" and \\"StarWars\\" sit that high. My only regret is that I bought the cheapest version. For a few more dollars, I could have had the Blue ray DVD too, plus more features.t Alien drinks acid and melts at the beginning of the movie.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|with this app I always know how much time I have for every different use that I have. it keeps me on track.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I LUV this cd! I was a fan of hers on AI but man she was hiding all the true talent she really has. The music arrangements are a throwback to the 60's and some 50's stylings and are fantastic. Her voice is amazing, I just can't get enough of it. I really do love every song on this cd. I even bought a copy for a friend. I hope everyone gets to hear this amazing young woman sing from her soul.
B008IGP8QE|1.0|I tried watching this show. Its a failure. Why on earth is it just Ross Lynch? Laura Romano has sung maybe 5 songs. Where are her songs? This should of just been a Disney ROSS LYNCH album. Im tired of the dreck Disney Channel keeps manufacturing.......what happened to the days of the Winnie the Pooh Soundtrack, and Movie songs. Not this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A \\"Page\\" turner.  Love the format...Present to past and back again.  Easy to follow with just enough characters to keep reader interested and not get lost in who's who.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Patch Adams is a phenomenal movie, starring Robin Williams, about the power of a little laughter in the healthcare world, and the ability of one compassionate doctor to make a huge difference in the lives of his patients. A well directed and extremely moving film, it is a movie that I would definitely watch again and again!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I absolutely. love this game can not wait to get the next one hurry please. guys have went back an replayed it several. times well worth. the money more games like this please
B003CHK8WI|5.0|Best show ever on television. Better than Dark Shadows, and I never thought any show would ever beat Star Trek, but this does!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest,  but this app has issues. It takes forever to get it to load!! Once it loads, its fine though.
B009FREK3W|5.0|Instead of a repackaging of the same old hits we get brand new re-recordings of classic ELO tunes performed masterfully by the inimitable Jeff Lynne (with a great album cover to boot!).  It's remarkable how close the new recordings are to the originals but since every piece of the music was recreated and re-engineered,  there are notable differences. It's the nuances and variations in the recordings that makes this an interesting listen.  Having said that, I don't think these remakes will replace the originals any time soon.  Though they add a touch of clarity and sizzle, at times they veer into karaoke territory like the keyboard punctuating the chorus in Evil Woman or the bridge in Turn to Stone.  That is when you wish the band members who lent their extraordinary talents to the original recordings could have been there to provide that extra oomph.  For the most part Jeff succeeds admirably and creates great results with Mr. Blue Sky, Can't Get It Out of My Head, 10538 Overture, Livin' Thing, Strange Magic and Showdown but a little less so with Turn to Stone and Don't Bring Me Down (no pun intended).<br /><br />I was actually looking forward to this album more than Long Wave which is why I downloaded it from Amazon immediately upon its release.  I absolutely love the new track \\"Point of No Return\\" which fits right in with recent previously unreleased tracks \\"Latitude 88 North\\" and \\"Surrender\\" as among ELO's finest.<br /><br />I hope that this revisiting of his illustrious ELO heritage will bear fruit in Jeff releasing a volume 2 or 3 in this series or, even better, a brand new ELO album that returns to the Shangri-La of lush orchestration and classic rock sensibility of mid-70's ELO.<br /><br />If all we get is a volume 2, here are the 10 songs I would like to see included:<br /><br />1. So Fine<br />2. Shangri-La<br />3. Nightrider<br />4. Wild West Hero<br />5. Shine a Little Love<br />6. 21st Century Man<br />7. Calling America<br />8. Sweet Talkin' Woman<br />9. Big Wheels<br />10.Hold On Tight<br /><br />Addendum: there is also a deluxe version that contains the bonus tracks Rockaria!, Ma Ma Ma Belle as well as unplugged renditions of Can't Get it Out of My Head and Steppin' Out.  If I knew that ahead of time I would have downloaded that version instead. Plus you get a digital booklet as an added bonus.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan is a amazing writer and has got so far since writing the lightning theif. I have rea all of his books and am amazed of how great they are. When i got this book i could not put it down. I read this book in four hours of non-stop reading. I myself cannont wait for the next book to comeout fall 2013.  Rick Riordan is one of my favorite writers and i am stunned by his writing. You have to read this book and all of hisother books too.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|Definitely as gripping and engaging as the first book.  I was really invested in Fitz and all he was trying to accomplish in this second book of the trilogy.  However, the ending was too unresolved.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Fitz had so many goals, the author gave him so many obstacles in the way of those goals and at the end we're left with our protagonist...alive.  And that's it.  Every other thing he attempted to accomplish was a failure.  Regal should have been dead at the end of the book and the character free to move on to some other goal, some other distraction.  Fitz should be on his way to find Verity and The Elderlings.  I just feel like as far as plot goes, we're not really in a new place for the third book.  Regal is King, The Raiders are in no way defeated, and Fitz is...as he always is in some form or another, super screwed.  I just felt really cheated, I think the author really pushed the boundaries of what it is to give your readers SOME resolution.  I was so angry I waited a whole 24 hours to purchase the third book on my kindle.  And Robin Hobb has A LOT to answer for in this final installment.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|when i read the first  page wow it was good<br />but the only thing that was wrong was not much pages make it more And i will give it five stars!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game puts u in a western world, and your job is to make a town. after a while you can start going fishing, visit other towns people have created, and shoot some animals for food. there is a couple downsides though. a couple times I have found it freezes on me, but not to terrible. you also have no helpers so that means u have to cut down trees and gather materials all by yourself. this can take a long time to get done. to fix the tree problem then get 15 cash and get the golden ax. works miracles. anyway great game with a couple of annoying problems. I would recomoned it!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|James does an excellent job of describing a woman's capacity for empathy, her ability to morph into whomever her lover needs her to be.  Then, by extension, the description of a woman's psychic pain with her recognition she has committed to a relationship that cannot work, is rarely captured so well.<br /><br />The primary weakness of this novel is the author's too casual repetition of certain phrases that distract the reader.  For instance, the use of the verb \\"clamber\\" is simply excessive.<br /><br />With just a bit more proofreading before publication this could have qualified as a genuine classic.<br /><br />And, by the way, the focus is not titillating pornography but scintillating relationships.
B0097S0TM0|4.0|I actually liked this album more than I thought I would. It has multiple songs that I like. It is her best overall album in years.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The story kept me entranced...I couldn‘t put it down. Entertaining and thought provoking , I want to read more by this author.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Loved the product. Can't believe how fast it got to my home. Ordered more products later and received them very quickly. Good shape when they got here. Excellent.
B00000J0O2|5.0|Product performs as expected.  I would encourage others to purchase this cartridge from this seller.  Works exactly as when I purchased the same cartridge from the HP website.<br />Thank you!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Movie got here quick and it's so much better than the first season. Would recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the first one. Can't wait for season 3.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Love the action in this movie, I loved the actors and the suspense. I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love it . When I am sleeping I set it on whatever sound I feel like and then I just fall asleep right there.
B0091LS0BU|5.0|This is maybe the greatest album of Paul in the latest years. I saw Live kisses during a flight and I had to see it almost three times. A wonderful experience entirely, I really enjoyed it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great for getting ideas and organizing them for an event...love it!  really great app!  planning a wedding and it has come in really handy!
B004SCN2F6|5.0|i have been playing this over a year now and constantly get updates.  always adding new content.  the best 2 dollars i have ever spent.  get the free version, if you like it but its too deep and complex, read up a little on it in the help menu.  my longest lasting game without an uninstall.  I am a level 259 hyperion lord with over 2 million dollars.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I didn't love this book as much as Mitich Albom's other works, but it is still a good book. A tad on the short side. It's worth reading.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|A deep and practical approach for every situation. A step by step journey to better communication. The right way to get what you want without hurt your self and others.
B0057UA486|5.0|Don't need to review Barry Lyndon here... If you know about it, chances are I won't enlighten you any further.<br />Regarding the Blu-Ray release of this movie, it is undoubtedly one of the best looking Kubrick releases to date, in my opinion. Picture quality is so perfect for the candlelit scenes. Audio is superb. Overall a very good quality product.<br />On the low end, I'd like to mention the very poor menu options. The only extra is the theatrical release trailer. Bare bones but, when bare bones is Barry Lyndon on full 1080p and uncompressed audio, I give it a 5 start and that's the end of that.
1449410243|5.0|I came to Amazon to buy this book and was surprised to see it had two 1-star reviews.  Uh oh, I thought, is the Oatmeal losing its funny?  Nope.  The two reviews are for technical failures of the digital downloads, not for the book itself.  Please don't give bad reviews to books that you haven't yet read!  (And I promise I'll never in future give GOOD reviews to books I haven't yet read.)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's not literature and from a man's perspective, it reinforces a Brazilian joke that women are not fond of men, they are fond of money...<br /><br />That said, the book is entertaining.  Characters are not very plausible, but the entire plot holds itself together in a readable fashion.<br /><br />To be honest, I would like to read this story from Christian Grey's (the male main character) perspective.  If well-written, that would be a much denser reading.
B009AJDDQU|3.0|Did it explain some stuff? Yeah, sort of. Was it a corny explanation? Well, yes ... Was it kind of fun? Yes. Still I'll never get those hours back and I kind of miss them. Oh well, maybe it's just time to end the series.
1451662432|2.0|Though I use to love Arnold years ago, I have to say I was really saddened by his book. It was pretty easy to predict as he did start our as a body builder, turned action pack film star, then into politics. It was hard to not look at what he said and not think of ways he would betray his wife. I was disappointed with the whole book and he truly lived up to what I thought about to the end. He hasn't changed and that is shown when he said \\"is just a part of me.\\" on Page 593 of an autobiography. I wouldn't waist my money on this book.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book; the characters are mature and very likeable, the emotions are intense and overall, the book is very well-written and full of surprises. I actually experienced heartache while reading this so kudos to the author for invoking such emotion in the reader. I didn't even know there was a second book until I finished the first one and saw the preview so I'm excited to see what becomes of these characters, especially since I developed a bit of crush on Mr. Will Cooper.<br /><br />It was nice to see young adults thrust into such mature situations and for them to handle it so gracefully. I really respect these kids and enjoyed their story.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't begin to explain how frustrated I am!  I read this book in just a few short hours, and will probably read again this weekend when I can devote a non-stop session to read it again cover to cover!  Just like Bared to You, I was hooked from the opening paragraph to the very end.  The story and the construction of the characters and their painful flaws is utter perfection.  I can't begin to imagine what the next 2 1/2 months are going to be like as I wait for the third installment on 12/31/12.  I wish they would release it earlier so that I could be put out of my misery!  Ms. Day you are amazing!  Thanks for the wonderful reading!  Cheers!!
B0011Z8SHK|1.0|Very Poor Quality Download. It does not sound well as you don't get the full quality of the Album. When you buy it on a disk the quality is tenfold and you can install it on your computer unprotected and won't have to pay or loose the rights to it when the store closes or changes its policy. This has happened with me twice.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I'm loving this book. Never though I would have learned so much from Canfield - such an inspiring motivator with not only his words but also his spiritual thoughts. Excellent book! Definitely recommend it to all my friends and family.
B008OJ2994|1.0|I regard Jeff lynne as one of the best singers of all time - but why on earth must he resort to this?.<br />He knows full well that many people will purchase this expecting the originals<br /><br />These versions are without the magnificent orchestrations of Louis Clark, and the undeniable talents of Mik Kamiknski (violin), Kelly Groucutt and Bev Bevan. All of them big stars in their own right.<br /><br />If he were honest Jeff Lynne would make it clear that these are new one-man re-recordings by calling it something like<br />\\"ELO reloaded\\".<br /><br />This is pure deception. And lacking respect for those former members who helped create the true ELO sound.<br /><br />please do some new ELO stuff!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|using this fb app on a new kindle fire hd.  very glitchy! no share button.  often opens a picture to the page of the source it was shared from when you do not want it to, then when you hit the back button, it takes you back to the top of the posts and you have to scroll back down again, being careful to not touch any pictures or you will go off that page again!  very frustrating!  needs to be fixed a s a p !
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like this app its a lot like Mario bros but not quite as good as Mario bros. I also think the graphics could be more pixalated
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I hare this game because it is hard to make munny and to pass the levels on it.sometime it will not play that long
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't have this game, but I played it on my friends kindle fire.  Please make a free one so I can play it!!!!!!!
0525953728|5.0|A great book and SEAL.Even liberals in San Francisco where I live have put this book at the top of the charts. (not the case with American Sniper or Lone Survivor.) Everyone wants to know this story. As for the pre-publication family squabble, I think all SEALS are HEROES but I believe there is more than a bit of jealousy involved here. Most of the profits are going to charity. Whats not to like?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Playing this on my kindle fire and am really enjoying it. It is like being at the carnival. I hate running out of coins but just like real life the quarter has to stop at some point.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  it is creative and interesting.  i look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it! it was just like the fifty shades books but with more romance. seems like i need Christian grey and gideion cross in my life.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Loved the product.  I have used it about five times to date and it is extremely easy to use and accurate.  I no longer have to look around for yardage markers and it is dead on every time.  It is already helping to improve my score.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I recently read the Playboy interview with Lee Child and he says he is only 1 or two novels away from killing off Reacher. It seems a good thing to me. Every character runs its course in the minds and pocketbooks of readers. This book is once again a good read and totally unbelievable in plot. If you love Reacher and can suspend disbelief, buy the book and read it but don't expect any new ground to be covered. I am tired of Reacher riding off into the sunset (or wandering off to the highway to stick out his thumb) after a series of mind numbing criminal acts with no consequences or conscience. I like Lee Child's style and hope he keeps writing and gives life to a new character that captivates me as the first 10 Reacher books did.
B002YVAT72|4.0|This turntable arrived via FED EX October 4 and was soon unpacked.  The players software was installed without a lot of complication.  Itunes needs to be downloaded to complete the software requirements .. but that is free. The USB connection and the 110 volt power cord finishes the connections. This Device is not made for rough use.  It is kinda light duty but plenty good if care is used.<br />At first I was stumped as to how to get the turntable to spin until the player arm was moved over the record.  In order to have stereo, one needs to open the computers sound recording dialog box and click on the 2 channel 4100 hz choice, then OK.  The software allows for automatic track seperation ... or not. All in all the setup is pretty easy and is exactly what I had in mind.  For me, the quality is just fine.  By now I have digitized more then 200 tunes I thought were gone forever.  The plan is to load these song files onto a flash drive and use them in our Prius's USB port.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|This expansion for Dixit adds a lot of options to the base game.  The art is beautiful, and the cards can be mixed into any of the three base Dixit games seamlessly.  Dixit is a wonderful, elegant party game, and this set's is a fantastic expansion to the game's deck of cards.
B008Y5OW20|3.0|Jeff Lynne is best known as the co-founder, leader, composer, and producer of Electric Light Orchestra, but he was also a Traveling Wilbury with Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty. He's a talented and well-respected musician, writing, arranging, singing, and playing most of the instruments (guitars, bass, keyboards, drums) on his solo releases, the last of which, \\"Armchair Theatre,\\" came out long ago in 1980. And he's produced albums for the individual Wilburys as well as Dave Edmunds, Del Shannon, Brian Wilson, and more.<br /><br />Props aside, this restrospective tribute to Lynne's 1950s childhood in Birmingham, England, when he tuned in to popular music on his father's long wave radio, is unfortunately less than rewarding. It's a lackluster collection of covers that's not varied enough to deserve many replays and that's too short to deserve 10 of your hard-earned dollars. The music is competently executed, Lynne is in good voice, and the songs he's chosen are chestnuts of long standing, so the strength of the material isn't the problem. But there are at least three critical failures that keep me from recommending \\"Long Wave.\\"<br /><br />The first drawback is a lethargic pace. Nearly all of the tracks have the same tempo, a plodding meter that robs the album of momentum. Second is the issue of brevity, since the ten cuts clock in at a mere 24 minutes, and the final \\"bonus\\" track brings the whole program to just over 27 minutes, which is not much more than an EP's worth of music. This seems a waste, not to mention a poor value, when you consider that 80 minutes can fit on a CD. My third complaint is that most of the songs have been given the ELO treatment, which some fans may never tire of, but which had me begging for a little variety after several tracks.<br /><br />My favorite tune is the first one: a loving rendition of Charles Aznavour's \\"She,\\" which is not so frequently performed. It's followed by two similarly slow, sentimental songs, \\"If I Loved You\\" from the Rogers and Hammerstein musical \\"Carousel,\\" and \\"So Sad (to Watch Good Love Go Bad)\\" by the Everly Brothers. Don Covay's \\"Mercy, Mercy\\" is mercifully a bit more uptempo, but it's been more distinctively covered by the Stones, the Wailers, Wilson Pickett, and others.<br /><br />The Roy Orbison aria \\"Running Scared,\\" pretty much a carbon copy of the original, is succeeded by another Broadway show tune: \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\" from the Rodgers and Hart musical \\"Pal Joey.\\" It's played far too slowly, as is Charlie Chaplin's \\"Smile,\\" which is given an odd, loping rhythm that would better suit a cowboy ballad. Two sluggish numbers ensue: \\"At Last,\\" closely identified with the late great Etta James, to whom Lynne simply can't compare, and \\"Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,\\" from the 1955 movie of the same name. The Four Aces took this schmaltzy song to number one on the charts.<br /><br />On track 10, Lynne finally revs the engine for Chuck Berry's \\"Let It Rock,\\" but it lacks the raw energy of the original. Bobby Darin's \\"Beyond the Sea\\" wraps up the album with an ELO-style guitar solo. Alas, despite the inclusion of some classic melodies, \\"Long Wave\\" is a pleasant but forgettable exercise in nostalgia (as is the other CD that Lynne is releasing this year, \\"Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra,\\" which contains one-man-band remakes of the group's hits). If you feel like reminiscing, go for it, but there are far worthier musical discoveries to be made.I Loved You\\" from the Rogers and Hammerstein musical \\"Carousel,\\" and \\"So Sad (to Watch Good Love Go Bad)\\" by the Everly Brothers.

B008YRVW0I|2.0|I really enjoyed playing this game the first day I loaded it onto my Kindle Fire. Really glad that it never asked for real money to build my fish tank.  NO WAIT!!! It does ask for real money... the next day when i tried to play the game it would not allow me to play unless I did one of two things... Bought the game$$$$$ or signed up for a \\"newsletter\\" something or other, i.e. junk email. Deleleted the game from my kindle and removed the app from my cloud.  But I guess that's what i get for expecting something \\"FREE\\" to be worth more that what I paid for it. LOL.
B0097VS7ZS|1.0|the stupid game broke my kindle fire none of my games work so now I half to get a new kindle fire
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|Even with his voice so ragged (more than usual) I enjoyed this more than other recent releases. Over all it's not nearly as good as \\"Time out of Mind\\" but there's enough here to enjoy. At least he sounds energized. Saw him on tour just a couple of years back and his performance was wooden and cold. I like all the songs, but for me the standouts are \\"Duquesne Whistle\\"; \\"Scarlet Town\\"; and \\"Early Roman Kings\\" (Dylan meets \\"I'm A Man).
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I read Maze Runner after The Hunger Games. That was my first start into the YA world of books. It grabbed this 37 yr old woman's attention. I really liked the idea of the book, I wish it slowed down more and described the maze and that world more. I went on to read the trilogy... and I am holding back on reading the prequel. Want to read more by this author. The characters, as I look back, seem more like adults.. and not as believable as kids. Overall, I would recommend it.
B008B8DWDU|5.0|A book I love so much that I have to own both the Kindle, paperback and audio version of it. My adoration for the author makes me biased, but I really found it to be an incredible adventure, one that I look forward to sharing with my children when they're a little older.

B004GTLVOA|5.0|Book four is equally as captivating as the first three. Gabaldon is definitely the best author I've ever read. This adventure focuses around Jamie and Clair's new life they begin to build since landing in North America. I rarely read a book twice. I am now half way through this series for the second time. Can't wait for the eighth!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great read, especially after reading the Prequel- First Shift - Legacy but read the Omnibus edition first.
1592402038|5.0|This is an excellent guide for an easy to understand compensation of punctuation marks.

B008QE9VJI|1.0|I wasted money on a \\"blue ray\\" copy of this movie! I was not impressed. I thought it was a serious vampire movie. I enjoyed the first 15 minutes of this movie until it started to turn very flakey, dry and dull. The movie loses all credibility; it's like some retarded version of the Adams family! Please do NOT waste your time buying this trash. This is a warning. I was so angry and disappointed, that I actually threw my blue ray copy in the trash...but I did keep the jacket! Sorry guys but it's not a hardcore vampire movie...it's a joke is what it is. Thanks

B00632HWOG|1.0|I used to love Yahoo Mail.  Recently Yahoo has gotten greedy with the type (and quantity) of advertisements they run while you're just trying to check your mail.  These \\"new and improved\\" advertisements do nothing more than making the page load AS SLOW AS POSSIBLE while your fire wall tries to make sure all these advertisements are safe.<br /><br />Poor choice Yahoo.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the fifty shades of grey series!  My fiance had bought me a kindle so I could read what everyone was talking about..  I finished that series in 4 days!  I found the bared to you series on amazon.  I fell in love!  I couldn't wait for book 2 to come out... I finished it in 2 days!  I found the author to be much more in detail then fifty shades.  I cant wait for book 3 in December!  I loved how she kept us guessing if Gideon was going to straighten up or leae...  and we got to know him a little and his past...  great book!  Not sure what series I will read after this one is done??

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Three words: A Maze Ing!<br /><br />Loved it! Couldn't put it down.  Stayed away from reading it because the thought of kids killing each other is disturbing to me.  But the context in which it is handled makes you able to direct your aching for the deaths of so many youths at the Capitol and root for Katniss and Peeta that much more, that all of the tributes are victims and the two's survival is that much more rewarding.  Can't wait to read the other two books!

B00914JWSW|5.0|To coincide with her latest North American tour Barbra Streisand has release this somewhat compilation-type CD that features rare songs that have never been released before from her discography.<br /><br /> Since 1962 Barbra has been releasing studio albums and at times certain tracks were dropped from the final album releases for various reasons. Over the past year Barbra has been going through all her master tapes (she owns them all!) and found certain songs she felt her fans would like and tracks that she discovered have aged amazingly well. The result is \\"Release Me\\" which is an exceptional album!<br /><br /> There are rare songs here, tracks that didn't make the cut from Barbra albums like \\"The Broadway Album\\", \\"Simply Streisand\\" and \\"Stonery End\\".<br /><br /> To me the highlights are \\"Didn't We?\\" that was originally suppose to be on an album that was never released called \\"The Singer\\" and the studio version of \\"With One More Look At You\\" from \\"A Star Is Born\\".<br /><br /> \\"Release Me\\" has also been released on rare vinyl and is now regarded as a collector's item.

B0089BSM70|5.0|I just viewed \\"Halloween 2\\" last night and I have to say it is a surprisingly good sequel to the 1978 classic. The film was released in 1981 and takes place on the same night as the original (October 3, 1978) and continues the story. Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is brought to the local hospital where she is recovering from wounds caused by the maniacal Michael Myers. There he tracks her down to finish what he started and as a result a series of murders takes place.<br /><br /> To me what was exceptionally inventive is the reason Michael wants to kill Laurie and it is revealed about half-way through the film.<br /><br /> On a paltry $2.5 million budget \\"Halloween 2\\" grossed a very impressive $26,000,000 and fans simply loved it. My only problem with the movie was Jamie Lee's wardrobe. LOL.<br /><br /> This was to be the franchise's final film, but due to impressive box office sales other sequels and movies were made that should never have been.
B00001QEE9|3.0|Of course no matter what your age, I'm sure you've at least heard of Disney's classic movie.  It was the second in a long string of excellent classics created by Walt Disney and his wonderful team.<br /><br />In this movie, a toy and clock maker name Geppetto, along with his two pets, a cat named Pedro and a fish named Cleo, brings this classic to life!  Pedro and Cleo both have personalities without even saying a word.  Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real.<br /><br />Our story teller is a cricket named Jimminy.  He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years.<br /><br />We also meet a boy named Lampwick who assures Pinocchio that it would be more fun to be bad then good.  He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil).<br /><br />Most of the animals in this movie have personalities.  I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish.  The whale had a booming personality.<br /><br />Famous songs were in this movie as well.  Of course, we've all heard \\"When you wish upon a star,\\" which becomes the theme song for Disney movies, even today.  \\"Little Wooden Head,\\" \\"Give a Little Whistle,\\" and \\"I've Got No Strings\\" are also all great songs.  Of course, the action in the ocean scene is a must see for sure!<br /><br />I've already mentioned the sins of Lampwick, but other things parents may want to be aware of in this classic are:  Saloon dancing puppets with obvious cleavage and one scene where Jimminy Cricket touches the backside of a statue and makes a big deal out of it.<br /><br />This particular collection doesn't seem to have a lot of extras on it.  I bought it mainly for the movie, so it served it's purpose.

B001NLKT60|5.0|amazing book keeps you wanting to read more and more.  i would definitely recommend this book :-) All three of them are amazing
B008EQIK90|1.0|I know it's rated R, but I expected more humor than cussing. That was not the case. To me it seemed that the writers may have been going for a record of how many F-bombs they could put in a movie. The cussing was really unecessary. This could have easily been a PG-13 film if the producers weren't so excited about every cuss word in the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a wonderful book, full of imagination anddescribes everythingso well, the feelings, the settings, the people, it is a ver entertainingbook, i recomend it 100%.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book was amazing.  I felt as though I was on the trail with Cheryl.  Very descriptive writer who gives you a wonderful sense of place.<br />I highly recommend it!!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Released finally!! Some of the most terrific songs that the public has never heard can be heard on this wonderous CD. Those naysayers that love to tear successful people apart have really very little chance on this recording because it's the voice of the sixties, seventies and eighties that is heard here. There is one recent recording and that one might be the bait for those people.<br /><br />The voice is a WOW on every cut! The songs are ones by great composers and lyricists. The music and orchestrations are all top notch. There is one cut that I don't much care for--it is bossa nova and Antonio Carlos Jobim. But Barbra is brilliant performing it. It's just not my cup of tea. That being said--she is brilliant with her renditions of Didn't We, Willow Weep For Me, I Think It's Going To Rain Today (with only the great Randy Newman accompanying her on piano) and Home from The Wiz with only piano, bass and drums. There is Broadway musical material with Being Good from Hallelujah Baby, masterfully performed, and a medley of How Are Things in Glocca Morra and Heather on the Hill from Finian's Rainbow and Brigadoon that is truly breathtaking.<br /><br />The cover is great and the packaging is too. There is a booklet telling the listener about the \\"vault\\" from which all of these recordings come from and notes on each selection, when it was recorded, etc.<br /><br />It is stated that there will be a second volumn on unreleased material. I, for one, can't wait.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Where to begin...This grows on you over the years. It has its immediate appeal,too; but some of these songs are so personal that one blushes at the fact that you are allowed insight to this mysterious person's life. Quicksand and Bewley Brothers are my favorites. I just don't understand them at all. Cool! Lay me plate and bake me pie I'm starving for me gravy. I'll tell you all about it on the next Bardo. Andy Warhol is a scream.Truly! Is there life on Mars? Lennon's on sale again.<br />It's not just surreal, it's super-real. Here she comes again, the same ole painted lady from the brow of the super brain. All the nightmares came today and it looks as though they're here to stay. This album charted in America before Ziggy and was critically acclaimed. The songs are about real people. One can only guess who they are. Queen Bitch is about Lou reed , so I've been told. Differrent place, different time. Gaga is almost here, but not quite. Some day she'll hit it though. With our backs on the arch, the devil may be here but he can't see thru all that, we were gone, real cool traders, kings of oblivion,we were so turned on in the mind warp pavilion. Sheer poetry. I'm still finding new things with every new listen 40 years later.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|I was NOT happy with this film.  Yes, Meryl Streep was brilliant, but the plot?  meh.<br /><br />first of all, it doesn't pertain at all to historical facts. It's based on a first person perspective from an aging woman looking back on her past - but she had Alzheimers!  Therefore, how can the screen writer and director really know what Margaret is thinking?  It's a fictitious account of her life and career.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|Everything is in this title. But they had to change it at the last moment for copyright infringements reasons.<br /><br />The title \\"Prometheus\\" may actually be the only thing they didn't cut & paste from another previous story, if you except the Greek mythology that's been going on for a while now (like 4000 years or so). Seriously it felt like re-heated food from a couple of days (maybe weeks) ago. A constant sense of \\"deja-vu\\" spoiled every single moment of the film, with reoccurring \\"subtle\\" references to Alien(s), and other films of the same kind. I mean forced feeding references, like a good alien would do, you know what I mean...<br /><br />Talking about food, I guess the only thing that they didn't dare to do in this grotesque farce, was to cook an alien just for fun \\"to see how it tastes\\". They actually came close to it by having a team member drink some alien goo without reason in a cocktail!! Jackass, here I am!! The team of dumb scientists is absolutely irresistible, I have to admit. But not in a multi-billion production like this. Maybe if the film would have been made by a group of sexually depraved high school students with their mobile phones, it would have been an interesting concept. Not here sorry...<br /><br />I have to say that this film creates a category of its own, mixing top notch CGI, low grade trash, Z series sci-fi, tainted comedy, gory horror, and (cough) hyper cheap phi-lo-so-phy. The best of ALL WORLDS!! At the end of the day you get a CGI team who struggled to do its best (and I admit that they achieved well), with a seriously degenerate scenario, terrible acting and, OMG, the worst dialogs of all times, at least since the Earth was colonized by aliens. The dialogs made me wish the film was dubbed in the alien language. I almost suffered head hemorrhages at the vacuity of the phrases. But wait, maybe that's what happened to the alien's head by the way!!<br /><br />Editing, as someone said, is nightmarish, and the argument which consists in saying \\"just wait for the director's cut\\", makes me puke my (alien) diner in advance. Two hours of this painful joke was way too long already. It's even laughable. In fact even the scientists, the aliens and the android laughed their heads off during the course of the film!!<br /><br />I would have loved to hear what the Great George Carlin (not Lucas) would have had to say about such a \\"gross misunderstanding\\" of a movie. Personally, I feel sick...

0385360177|5.0|This was amazing. I enjoyed it tremendously. Can't wait to read the third one. My anticipation is high and I recommend this series to everyone.
0345803485|3.0|So much has been written about this set of books, that I wonder if the world needs another opinion, but I am going to share mine anyway.  I figure that the best thing to come from these books, is that it has people talking.  There are two things to keep in mind if you want to read the 50 Shades books.<br /><br />1.  They are not great literature, they are a fun read.  Well, fun if you are ok with the graphic sexual content and not everyone is.  I would hope that by now anyone thinking of reading them is aware of the graphic nature.  If you are expecting a well written and character driven story, you will be bitterly disappointed.  It is, in fact, repetitive and full of errors and feels like it was written by a teenager in the middle of heat who thinks they understand how adults act when they are alone.  The understanding of the geographical layout of the Pacific Northwest is questionable and so is the authors understanding of the BDSM world.  It is incredulous to think that our heroine (snort laugh)does not have her own email address (mandatory for any college student, go ahead and ask one) has never encountered any mention of this world in her college years (it has been covered extensively by CSI on CBS for freaks sake.)  For that matter, the concept of a 23 year old woman being a virgin because she has never met anyone she felt that way about and then she becomes a raging sex monster is also quite unrealistic and shows the lack of maturity that went into the writing.  Consider that she started this as fan fiction based on the Twilight novels/movies and you might understand this is pure adolescence trying to be grown up.  That it is written by an adult is not relevant, it is the level it is written at.  Both characters are painted as too broad, archetypes badly drawn.  He is only 27 but is a multibillionaire, built like a greek god, can fly, sail and have sex about 5 times a day- when does he have time to run a company pray tell? She is the well read, college virgin who does not like or want his money and overcomes all the odds to change him and win his heart.  It is just all too unlikely.  And I hear an English accent when I hear Christian as the phrasing is not as American as she thinks.  And please don't get me started on the Inner Goddess or the other inner voices for Ana, she feels like she has DID and could use as much couch time as Christian.<br /><br />2.  This book is an opening that can be used to start a conversation about sex with an intimate partner or just for super charging your own fantasies that can fuel your lovelife.  If you take it for what it is, badly written romance or overblown (pardon the pun) porn, you will be able to enjoy.  I personally was able to jump over the references to her Inner Goddess (who I wanted to strangle by the end of the books)and first person narrative that is used quite poorly.  I grasped the points she was making and accepted it for what it was.  I wanted to understand something that had become a phenomenon and I think I do.  For many people it is eye opening and completely new.  It allows women to talk about sex a little more freely and is kind of like Lady Chatterly's Lover in making it more acceptable to discuss.  If this book helps stir people out of the prudish box they live in and think and maybe even read up on some of the subject matter, then I am more than willing to overlook the Hindenburg sized holes and errors.  If even just a few people gain perspective using this book, then more power to it.
B008V0OLOW|1.0|I really don't know what to think of Diana Krall these days. I think she lost her musical center about the time she married Elvis Costello and hasn't found it since. Everything since \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" has seemed unfocused to me. Of course getting married, having kids and losing a parent would be enough to unfocus anyone. \\"Quiet Nights\\" should have been as good as \\"The Look of Love\\" but wasn't even close. \\"Christmas Songs\\" should have been as good as the EP \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" but lacked heart. I listen to this CD and hear more of the same that I heard on the last several CDs: a lack of heart or feeling. My gut impression is that she lost her mojo somewhere along the way and doesn't know it. Now she has taken to hiring Hollywood costumers and doing artwork shoots in garter belt and stockings. It all just smacks of an attempt to reach for something and not quite make it, mainly because you just can't seem to care enough or focus enough to do it.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|A dark story,  narrated excellantly with changing voices for ths different characters.  A painter friend convinces the extremely handsome, Dorian, to pose for him.  The painting turns out so well Dorian wants to keep it.  He makes a wish that he would always be so handsome and only the painting show his aging and scars of life.  His wish is granted and you should follow the outcome of his life.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I happened to pick up the first book just to see what all the talk was about.When I started Tattoo I was about 100pages into it and almost gave it up and now am glad I continued. Unlike the first book, this started out at a good pace and kept it up. This is one intelligent,feisty,survivor of a young woman. Whenever I thought It was getting close to the end another group of characters were after Lisbeth or helping her.  I can't wait to start Hornets Nest and will probably be sorry when I can't read about Lisbeth anymore.  I hope it all turns out for her in the end.  I don't want to be up crying at 2:00AM for a fictional character.  I read for entertainment and this trillogy fit the bill.
B0053TMP24|5.0|why is this not currently available? i have the print version of this from my local library, but i want one for myself. anyone know when it will be available again?
B007ADIRDM|4.0|Saw this as a value pack at Costco and am considering purchasing it for one of my three monster high fans. The Costco version has comes with two dolls (Draculaura and Clawdeen). While it is really cute and I'm sure the kids will love it, I'm not so sure how long they will be able to contain the small parts in the proper areas. I guess only time will tell.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the app. it became even better when they updated the site for anderoid usage. I love being able to go to one place to find recipes,  crafts and style ideas.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been using these a couple years now, and they're holding up well.  Great sound quality, especially for something under $100.  I've heard $200+ \\"gaming\\" headsets that didn't this good.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I'd heard a lot about this trilogy, and it did not disappoint! The whole trilogy is amazing - great storyline, addictive characters, the lot!! The only thing I could fault, would be that the sex parts are quite repetitive... however, this also helps to reestablish the characters' personalities, wants and needs.<br />Overall, a page-turning read.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The Wanted Man is excellent and well written. Characters are great and suspense is constantly building. Off beat plot but interesting and very much in character for Reacher, on of my favorite characters. I really look forward to Lee Childs books. My only complaint is how could he allow that little wimp, Tom Cruise play Reacher. Oh well, I know Cruise bought the rights. It just seems stupid casting. On the other hand more people will see the movie than read the books so I guess Child can take some satisfaction in that. Can't wait for the next book I guess next summer.
030758836X|4.0|For those of you who love swimming in acid this is the book for you.  Flynn is a gifted writer whose prose is seamless with a truly creative ability to plot an unexpected story line.  The problem for me is that the characters are vile and warped, and their fate of absolutely no interest other than the faint satisfaction that would come if they both died.  This author claims to \\"love her characters\\" no matter how warped.  Good for her, and anyone else who likes to investigate mental illness.  Not for me and I will never again read one of her books.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|was pleasantly surprised to see such mature acting.<br />well done! would recommend and would probably see it again! for sure.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I really only use Facebook on mobile, so it's a must have app.  The really nice thing about this app is that you don't see any of the ads that you are inundated with on the website, although I'm sure they are working on it.  My big peeve with this app is that it wants to show you what they feel are the top stories in my feed so I am constantly going into my settings to change it to most recent.<br /><br />All in all, it's an app that suffices, but Facebook is becoming a tired platform and I'm just waiting for the next wave of mobile social to take over what Facebook can't figure out.
0525953728|3.0|Thre is not so much news in this book. Almost all the information are in the public domain!!Just to make fast buck I guess!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Each episode leaves you wanting more. It is almost impossible to stop watching once you get started, so allow plenty of time.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I loved this show on TV but I didn't get to see them all and even the ones I had seen I love watching again. I bought the whole set so I can now watch them all without commercial interruptions.

0140111603|4.0|Sisters Margaret and Helen Schlegel are leading fairly conventional lives in London until a couple of events begins to change things in ways none of them can imagine. It starts with Helen's short visit to the very proper, upper-class family named Wilcox, and the recovery of an umbrella belonging to a clerk named Leonard Bast. How these three families' lives intertwine over a period of time is at the heart of this intriguing story.<br /><br />Howards End is the third E.M. Forster I've read, and the best book so far. It's been interesting to read his novels in the order they were written, as Forster's development as a writer clearly shows. Each book creates a more intriguing, multi-layered story. Character development is better, as is the author's finesse with narrative. Those who've read my earlier reviews of Forster's work know I wasn't impressed. I still don't like Forster's style of stopping the story to tell us something about the social condition, or the subtext of relationships, so I skimmed through those parts. I have two more Forster novels on my to-be-read pile. I look forward to seeing how far his skills evolved.
B005D0RDKW|4.0|Somehow I have made a monster blunder. I Re-listened to both DVD & Blu-ray. They are the same. The only reason that I can figure out as to why I thought incorrectly the DVD was better than the Blu-ray, the best I recall, there was nearly a 40-60 day period between me playing both versions. I have an extremely large system, dolby digital, dts, thx 6.1 Pioneer elite receiver, five power amps w/roughly 8,900 watts conservatively not counting the amps in the six berenger active powered studio monitors (225 watts rms each). I use a matching berenger stereo electronic crossover, two way w/sub output, on front monitors, woofers & subwoofer. I was going through a major upgrade on subwoofers. I build my own subs using high end subwoofers like infinity reference(2-10\\"s, 2-12\\"s), pioneer champions(4-12\\"s) and planet audio big bangs(a 10\\" & 12\\"). I use old sub cabinets from earlier purchases like DCM Sub 2s, Cerwin Vega 12\\" sub, and a high gloss paradyne 10\\" dual port cabinet. Throw in two 10\\" grey and a dual 12\\" grey cabinet. I have two front and two rear subs off the effect channel. I use combinations of dual and single voice coil subs for optimum ohm loads for amps. Between crossover, receiver, and sub volume settings I must have screwed up. There is NOTHING wrong with this Blu-ray. When compared directly back to back with DVD, they are the same. This Blu-ray live concert has some outstanding picks of songs by Rush, recorded in stunning DTS-HD 5.1, like the entire uncut album 'MOVING PICTURES'. It's one of those 'you have to hear it.....or you will never believe it' things rarely ever caught live. Geddy's bass playing comes though so completely different here, so crystal clear, so incredibly dynamic, it's very much like you've never actually heard him play before. Many of the live versions you will hear here are way better than the studio versions! Keep in mind, I am comparing their \\"MOVING PICTURES\\" dvd-audio 5.1 deluxe edition studio to the live version on this Blu-ray. The entire live version is stunningly better. It has a great deal of Rush's early career, quite a few tracks off their 'Snakes And Arrows' CD of recent note and a few off the even newer 'Clockwork Angels' CD. Over all, I am extremely pleased with my new found re-examination for 'Time Machine' Live and absolutely love the disc. With Rush being entered into the rock and roll hall of fame shortly after this brilliant performance, it's not a stretch to believe any judge considering their fitness to HOF hearing this concert would vote Rush in instantly.e entire live version is stunningly better.

B008QTVNUI|4.0|I have only watched the pilot episode.  Yet, already I can tell that this will be a captivating show, full of twists and turns.  Tonight I will watch episode 2 and I'm looking forward to it already.  I love being able to watch a show like this whenever I feel like it which is why I love buying shows from Amazon.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|As a KISS fan since the 80's I thought Sonic Boom was their greatest recording of all time. Monster might challenge my previous opinion. On first listen Hell or Hallelujah, Eat Your Heart Out and All For The Love of Rock and Roll stood out to me. I'm listening a second time in a row and I have to add Take Me Down Below to that list. Incredible that after almost 40 years KISS is this great with this lineup.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app on my kindle!  No problems using it. Easy to use when I'm not in front of my computer. Love it!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Ken Follett has brilliantly written an immense historical novel stretching from pre-World War I to pre-World War II, all the while juggling the lives of several European families who experience passion, birth, death, and class interaction while their lives play out amidst preparations for war and coming to terms with peace.  From the opening chapters detailing life in a Wales coal mining town, to the Russian march into Europe, it's a good way to learn world history involving great powers and dynasties.  Follett has captured those years in exquisite detail and keeps the reader anticipating what will happen next.  I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading the second book of the trilogy.
B008A1NSTG|2.0|My gf made me watch this because it was filmed in Alaska and she is from Alaska. That was about it to this movie. Hippie Drew Barrymore was pretty annoying, and the only part I enjoyed were the two Minnesota guys who made the de-icing machine.<br /><br />Dont watch unless you must. This movie is really sappy.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I know people are boohooing because this isn't the \\"Super Amazing, Ultimate, Christian-Bale-lives-inside-of-the-boxed-set\\" 2013 version of the Trilogy.  But for someone like myself who has a moderate movie collection, this is the perfect deal for the perfect price. I am not a big \\"new-release movie purchaser\\" to begin with (I wait 1-2 years until the movies are dropped to under $10). So for me, having all three on Blu-ray for $30 is just fine. We don't own any of these yet, so I'm happy for this great deal!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child  has again come up with a fast moving Jack Reacher novel. A great read that you won't put down.
B00846TRHY|5.0|I loved the premise for this story and the life changing ability of God, but I grew tired of the excessive bad language. The point was effectively made in the first  twenty minutes  or so. Would have greatly appreciated a lesser display for the rest of the film as I am capable of relating to the former language.
B004XZR63M|5.0|A friend of mine recommended me this book, I bought it to give it a shot and it caught me. I read it in a week. The book is easy to read, and the message is clear. What I like the most is that it doesn't give you a secret formula, a snake oil recipe or silver bullet, but instead go down to basics. I loved the book and I'm now reading another one from his collection. The sooner you read it, the faster you'll be able to achieve your financial goal. Whichever this might be. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Cheers!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Beautiful and sad story about life in the foster care system, the effects of abandonment and how love can and will always prevail. Interesting sideline about the meaning of flowers. Quick read!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another excellent and fast paced Reacher novel. A Wanted Man begins with Jack trying to make his way to Virginia until he encounters people who are not whom they appear to be which Jack quickly begins to realize. Readers are drawn into Reacher's mind as he continually evaluates what must be done to survive his surroundings. The final chapters are quick and exciting as this novel comes to a close. A must read for all the Jack Reacher and author Lee Child fans.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Although only half way through the 2nd of the trilogy it is every bit as absorbing as book one and has been an easy follow on.  hope the 3rd book is just as exciting as the first two.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|a good game to keep you occupied while at DMV or anywhere for that matter. it's fun and never locks up.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Moving, realistic account of the final chapter of a very passionate man. He remained consistent in his beliefs as he faced death.
1423140605|3.0|Not the best book Rick has ever written. I started reading the book and didn't like it that much, I mean you have to wait for the book to get good. But the thing is... I'M STILL WAITING! I'm over half way done with the book! I'm reading the book so I'll understand everything in the books to come, but The Mark of Athena is definitely not my favorite. I encourage you to read the book, just don't get upset if it doesn't meet your expectations.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Insulting, demeaning, repetitive, boring, pornographic drivel. Can't believe it's on the best seller list. I won't be reading the other two.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 is one of the best Thermal grease you can find in the market. Works fine, cpu runs cool, no problems at all.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this series! Just when I think I know what's going to happen, Martin completely surprises me! I initially became interested in the series after watching the show on HBO. But I was so confused by what was happening that I decided I needed to read the books. After reading the first 674-page paperback, I knew I had to get a Kindle for the remaining books in the series :) My favorite character is Arya and I'm eager to see where Martin takes her story. I definitely recommend this series to anyone who has the imagination to go with it!
0316228532|4.0|This is not fantasy and is in no way a Harry Potter book.<br />This novel follows the lives of those living in a small English community, with a village green and even cobbled streets. But that is were the perfection ends, these are the all too human and flawed characters Rowlings describes in fine detail, warts and all.<br />The story begins with the untimely death of Barry Fairbrother, an outspoken member of the town council and so a Casual Vacancy is created. Then we follow the plotting and intrigues of those applying to fill the vacancy and those trying to gain control of the council. You soon discover that everyone has an agenda and most a skeleton in the closet.<br />What makes this a compelling read is the depth and naked truth that is shared about each character, making most unsympathetic but richer and much more real. As in real life people are difficult and teenagers sullen, actions have consequences and the ripples spread out affecting so many.<br />I enjoyed the book for it's honesty but realize it's not everyones cup of tea - an English setting, with English phrasing and nuances by a clever English writer. Poor editing in parts, was a bit of a distraction, hence the 4 stars rating.<br />This is a story about life in a tight knit community, the characters, their relationships and their thoughts described, their hopes and fears examined but never judged. Loyalties, family dynamics, marriages of every kind and small town politics make for a fascinating read.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I was skeptical of this book when I first came across it. I was thinking, \\"How can this book tell me something that I don't already know?\\". But to my surprise it did. And it did in such poetry and clear rational arguments, that after I finished it I wanted to read it again. Yes, I recommend this book and look forward to reading his other books.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed this Trilogy. the story line kept my interest and left me wanting more every time i laid my Kindle down for a break. The story also had interesting twists and turns that made for excelent reading. I very much enjoyed this Trilogy and highly recommend this as a \\"Hard to put it down read.
0525953728|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" covers the fascinating mission that a group of Navy SEALS underwent to kill Osama Bin Laden.  The story begins with the author's Navy SEAL training and continues to a detailed account of the most important mission in his life: killing Bin Laden.  The book covers the actual mission in great detail, including the intense training for the specific mission, the gear and supplies that he took on the mission, and even the food he ate prior to flying to Pakistan.  I found the whole thing fascinating.<br />The actual mission is told in dynamic tone, accompanied by diagrams of the mission and the buildings of Bin Laden's complex.  The ghostwriter did a great job writing a very easy-to-read book that was quick, bouncy, and efficient.  It's overall a worthwhile read.  Many people also don't realize that a large percentage of the profits of this book go towards various SEAL-related charities.  I hope the author didn't get himself into real hot water for writing it.<br />If you enjoy this book, I strongly recommend [[ASIN:B005K6SO0C WAR]] by Sebastian Junger.  It's a gritty account of a journalist who covered the war in Afghanistan.  It gives the other picture of the war on terror, from the eyes of the soldiers who don't get quite the glory of the Navy SEALS.

0736650601|5.0|I had seen the movie before reading the book and enjoyed it very much.<br />Movie's don't always give you the same enjoyment as the book and things are either added or left out of a movie.<br />As I have arthritis in my hands holding a book for very long makes reading difficult and so I tend not to read as much as I'd like.<br />Having been able to get this book on audio cassette made it very enjoyable.<br />I know there are more modern ways to read but I still like that I have to participate<br />if only to change the tape from side to side or turn it over.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, I have thoroughly enjoyed this family saga.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I read on average 2 books a week but this book was so bad it took me 3 weeks to force myself through it. a big waste of money!!!

B008VO3PA4|5.0|My cat and I sat down to read this book together and we both decided it was great.  I give it 2 thumbs up and Widget gives it 16 whiskers up! We both agreed that if she had oposeable thumbs this is exactly the kind of poetry she would write.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable book.  The photos were cute, but did not enhance the book as far as I was concerned.  Widget said since none of the photos were of her they should be taken out.  The only complaint I had about the book is that it wasn't long enough.  Great fun for cat lovers!  Buy it!

B0053O89IS|5.0|No surprise after all. That's what happens when you get married, at times even when you don't. Temperance got pregnant and this season we are going to see her delivering a child. To bring the father back into the picture because the plot needed it the baby is a girl? SO THAT Temperance is going to relive her bad experience with her father when she was a girl and he abandoned her, and her brother. But you all know that. They decide to name the girl Christine, I guess in honor of the film and the book by John Carpenter and Stephen King respectively.<br /><br />This season knits together some cases that solved in one episode and a couple of others that go beyond the episode structure. In that case even one that goes beyond the season structure. Suspense requires such tricks. TV is a Trickster. My favorite is \\"The Don't In The Do\\" in which there is no Indian but a hair fetishist who believe in scalping. Tie up your hair ladies, especially if you are gentlemen.<br /><br />The series uses of course many interns, rotating interns, which enables us to see some faces only episodically from time to time but repetitively every two or three episodes. That concentrates our attention on the six or so regulars and at the same time that gives us some new blood that titillates our interest.<br /><br />The mother Temperance is even worse than the doctor Bones. She is anxious, afraid, over protective, quasi paranoid, definitely on the verge of neurosis, which is anything but rational, and she turns every one around her completely upside down and crazy if they dare follow her along that line. You have to learn how to let the mother rant and rave about all the dangers that menace her child and hope one day she might let that child grow up, and some anxiety is needed to grow up, some challenge some would say.<br /><br />The most interesting part of this series is that the crimes are always extreme cases of asocial behavior and at time sociopathic derangement. It is practically always some hidden situation unknown of everyone that produces a reaction that brings forward a dead body. But in this series they always choose the grossest way to deliver the body, to wrap it up, to make it decay and rot, etc. There is no end along that line. It is always possible to make a body look more disgusting than what you have achieved in the previous episode. The rule is that you need to see the bones and to deal with the bones. You have to feel it in your buns.<br /><br />A last note will be about the follow up story that ends up unfinished this season. Temperance Bones is at stake and is menaced. She was too often over positive and over affirmative. It is her time to get challenged.

What reality is left after all that virtuality?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAIe hidden situation unknown of everyone that produces a reaction that brings forward a dead body. But in this series they always choose the grossest way to deliver the body, to wrap it up, to make it decay and rot, etc. There is no end along that line. It is always possible to make a body look more disgusting than what you have achieved in the previous episode. The rule is that you need to see the bones and to deal with the bones. You have to feel it in your buns.<br /><br />A last note will be about the follow up story that ends up unfinished this season. Temperance Bones is at stake and is menaced. She was too often over positive and over affirmative. It is her time to get challenged.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|It's not often that good clean fun is actually fun.  But this movie is just that.  Fun for all ages.<br /><br />Your littlest ones will enjoy the fluffy, Muppet characters and their quirky ways, just because they are cute and child friendly.  After all, these characters were made for pre-schoolers.<br /><br />And for the rest of us, ages 8 and up?  Well, that's the best part of this movie.  The script transcends all ages.  I'm not kidding.  There are jokes and pranks and one-liners that each age segment \\"gets\\" --- and I'm not sure we are all laughing at the same thing!  And that's fun!<br /><br />There's nothing offensive in the movie.  It's completely rated G.  Your kids will love it, and you'll enjoy the walk down memory lane.
B00914JWSW|4.0|...to hear Barbra Streisand's voice young, strong, and pure again singing...at least to my ears...new material. I also really enjoy hearing the interaction of her and the musicians and technicians. This material could have been edited out, but I'm glad they left it in because it shows Streisand really enjoying her work.<br /><br />This album is also shows once again that Streisand was and is one of the great interpreters of theatric songs like \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra\\" (a bit strange given her Brooklyn accent, but still beautifully sung) and \\"Home.\\" This is the type of material that started her career and I'm glad she has not forgotten her roots.
B0099LDUFI|5.0|Worth every penny, no-one does it like she does!!! Love it!!! I like every single track, and the music is amazing! Cannot wait for the tour.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book was hard to put down.<br /><br />Every guy should read this book. Seems more like every girls fantasies that they are too shy to tell you about.<br /><br />I'm building my own 'Red Room of Pain'
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like it but I'm just now downloading it weard I wish I was on wat level that's right 21._
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Ok, this one gets 3 stars again, in comparisson to the first one, this book is not only about \\"sex\\", although there's a lot of it still, I find it a little better, if you can bear with the repetitive scenes, the same fights, over and over (Ana can get very annoying) its an entreteining book, you get to know a lot more about Christian.  My opinion isn't changed, I still am not convinced with the author, she says the same things a lot, it gets boring, but since I will be starting the 3rd one soon, I guess I can't really say I don't enjoy reading the books, they are addictive for sure, its one of those books you read in a couple of days, not the best book ever, but its fun.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy Pintrest. I like how there are categories and really like bring able to search for specific things and getting a lot of ideas.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Enthusiastically obtained the new KISS album today and I have to emphatically state that it is, drumroll please...NICE! Very nice, indeed. This new collection of songs from the guys sounds pretty fantastic I have to admit. I zipped on over to Best Buy earlier this morning in anticipation to get my hands on a copy and have been happily listening to it throughout the day. It is exciting to hear these guys still making great music together and I am pleased to announce that this album is a very solid, rocksteady and strong addition to the KISS catalog of music that has been rocking us all since the early 70's.<br /><br />And I have been there with KISS since their earliest days. I have faithfully stayed with them pretty much throughout the good times and the lean times over the years, and to hear them still making such an impressive album as this one at this point in their long careers is nothing short of incredible, in my opinion. After the dismal Psycho Circus album I was thinking that it was probably over for one of my favorite bands ever, but thankfully I was wrong.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that it's been 3 years now since the release of their album prior to this one, titled Sonic Boom, which I also think is a great rockin' collection of songs, and here we are now with the release of Monster to continue on with the KISS musical legacy. These guys have still got it. This album truly kicks ass and keeps you pumped and that's all that one could ever really hope to ask for. These guys are helping to keep good old fashioned Rock 'n Roll music alive and kicking and I for one am grateful for it. Thank you, KISS, for all of the years of hard rockin' fun times and great songs.
B0086700CM|5.0|its really addictive. me and my boyfriend take turns playing it on my kindle. hope this helps you decide to download
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I definitely would read this again. It kept me on the edge of my seat even after seeing the movie, couldn't put the book down!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love the app so much the craft and diy section is now my favorite filler for the weekends. I also enjoy the gardening and food sections wonderful! my only trouble is that sinse it is a world wide site ( i think) sometimes the links will not be in your language, anyways over all its amazing, definatly a must have and a favorite, plus its free!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Very easily the most transformational hip-hop we're heard in years.  Most hip-hop these days is shallow...  That is to say that mostly it is a catchy hook and no more.  This is so so so much more then that.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|This story line begins with grisly discoveries of infant bodies but that is not the focus of the rest of the story.  Too much info about things I didn't care about...diamond indicator minerals, for example, and too many extra characters...in short, a not very satisfying romp through the Canadian wilds.
034580404X|5.0|AWESOME SET, i have a waiting list of friends who want to borrow them. Hoping for more books PLease! If you like this type of book, it is a definate recommendation. the 1st half of the 1st book is a little slow but hang on I promise it is worth it. THIRD BOOK is the best!
1469984202|5.0|I will be brief. Wool is one of the best books I have ever read and I have read a book a week for many years. I agree with all of the reviewers that gave 5 stars. I challenge anybody to start reading this story and stop before the end. I do not think it can be done. Thank you Hugh Howey. I will read everything that you write.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started ..a little confusion over some of the credits/energy but otherwise having lots of fun....<br /><br />Will rate again after more playing....truly enjoying the challange.<br />Deborah /GA
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put the book down for two days. I have to say I loved every minute of the book and kept wondering what was next. And I was sad when I hit the last page, I WANT MORE FIFTY!!!! The whole series was more than I was expecting and for that I love it!! I read the whole set in under 5 days!!
B0092R66T6|3.0|When do I \\"Press Play to Begin\\"? In 2001 \\"Final Fantasy: The Sprits Within\\" hailed a new era in film making. The CGI world took a giant leap towards the vitual realism we were all expecting to see from \\"the latest advancement\\" in technology. We knew that after that, anything was possible. And WETA! Serkis' Gollum came alive and we all pitied Sm&eacute;agol because he was so human, or halfling-ish. Roughnecks: The Starship Troopers Chronicles took that mo-cap edge and brought to the little screen what we just knew could be, one day, brought to fruition on the Big Screen. And I waited 12 years for This?<br /><br />So the movie opens with an almost direct quote from the Heinlein classic. Almost false advertising. The remainder of the script was more like \\"Starbucks Troopers: The Napkin Chronicles\\". I am a diehard fan of Heinlein's original, Paul Verhoeven's Fascist Indictment treatment, and yes, the Audu Paden and company's Roughnecks. I have bought-in to the franchise and drank my fill of the Kool-Aid. In other words, I HAD to see this. Did I HAVE to buy it too? They were all out of Catcher in the Rye...<br /><br />I give this 3 Stars because it is a worthy effort. It did move the ST Universe story-line along. (Though the Roughnecks already fought one Earth invasion.) It was a nice nod to both the live action and previous CGI versions. And, as bad as most of the dialogue was, it wasn't much worse than \\"Marauder\\". Is that a plus? The new team of Troopers carried the weight of their gear as well as could be expected. Good thing the plot was so light. Could you call this a classic too? No, but I read one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love their love story. The passion is great but the love is greater am sure the next book will amazing. Thank you
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's AWESOME! I love it because I can now look at Pinterest anywhere I go. It's AWESOME! I rate 5 stars on this! You NEED to get it!
B000SW2F80|5.0|I know Creepshow is intended as a horror movie, but for the most part, I couldn't helpbut laugh; especially during the scenes where Stephen King plays a simple farmer that becomes infected by an alien mold. If you love Tales from the Crypt, you will loves this movie, if only for the dark comedy.
0525953728|4.0|Even with the military acronyms it is an easy read of a black ops that went incredably right.  It is amazing what intel can discern.  The 2 negatives are a lack of maps showing the environs of Bin Lauden's compound- not the compuund itself but the surrounding countryside.  More importantly the hostoile treatment of the Commander -in -Chief was unnecessary.  The author expressed surprise that the President actually approved the action, after he is the President and acted swiftly and patriotically
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|I recently discovered TWD - watching the first season on Netflix in a couple of days.  I loved it so much, I bought this season and finished it in no time. What a great season!  I like the flashbacks to what happened while Rick was in a coma.  It answered a lot of questions for me.  You instantly start to love some characters, but equally hate some others.  I was glued to the screen!  Cannot wait until this weekend for the premiere of Season 3! If it's as good as season 2, I know I won't be disappointed.
B007THA4FI|1.0|So disappointed in this book.  Very boring.  I kept waiting for the story to take off but it never did.  A very depressing cast of characters and such a sad commentary on small town life.  I so loved the Harry Potter books and was expecting much more from this author.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This CD is great! Saw the PBS special on TV and knew I wanted to own it. Diana Krall, The Pizzarelli's, Eric Clapton and many other brillant performers are on this CD as well. Every track is sweet.
B008XG1X18|5.0|At first; I thought Pintrest was overrated and for uncreative teachers with no lesson plan and stay at home moms. Little did I know all the pretty pictures and inspiring quotes and funniest that awaited me! I'm a confirmed Pinoholic!!!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Great book, love to read this series of books by Lee Child.  Good action and easy to follow enjoyable reading, helps to take the cares away each time I get to read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book A LOT! The Hunger Games was great but it thought this one was better! Make sure you have time set aside to read this book because once you start you will not be able to stop! The author does a wonderful job of hooking you in and not letting go! Even till the end! CANNOT WAIT FOR THE MOVIE!<br />Also another little tip:<br />Make sure you have the third one near you when you're about to finish Catching Fire. You'll know why when you finish ;)
B001AUKUSG|5.0|I love this CD and wonder where Otis Redding would have taken his music if he hadn't have died so young.<br />I've heard he was digging Sgt.Pepper in 1967 and one wonders if he would have pulled some of this kaleidoscopic vibe into his tent.<br />I wonder how he would have synthethised these sounds into his music?<br />His powerhouse version of Satisfaction may provide a clue.<br />Also the sublime dock of the bay.<br />His phrasing of music and way of performing others songs was so idiosyncratic that the music takes on an addictive and unique quality.<br />I love soul music but Otis was probably its most consistent performer outside of the peerless Sam Cooke.<br />His death is one of the great tragedies of the 60s.<br />This album is great from go to whoa.<br />It is one of those albums where you don't want to skip over a track.<br />We are so lucky to have these wonderful documents from an era when music was much better than now<br />and when one song contained more ideas and vibrant performance than an entire album from 2012.
B0000WPADK|1.0|I was browsing the internet for sites that contained electric model steam locomotives.  The site that contains the \\"Big Boy\\" is one that is otherwise exclusively train set locomotives and other products.  Nowhere does the description on the \\"Big Boy\\" say that it is a plastic non-working model kit. If I had wanted a model kit I would have gone to a site for model kits. Revell should not have this product listed on this site.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my 3 yr old is addicted and so am I.  reccemend this for all ages. the whole family is addicted. we all love this.
B005SDB6RK|3.0|I Only bought it because I saw it at a home theater store and didn't see the whole thing. I was a little dissapointed in the video and will not be purchasing another until I see the whole movie
B006LSZECO|4.0|A detective story of the relationship between woman and man. The tension and suspense are not based on actions but of reveling and unfolding the love, revene and hatred between woman and man.
1455502758|5.0|Talk about a life changing read! As always Hitchens elocuent and fluid in his ideas. Really gives you a perspective of how fulfilling life can be.
B007SGM084|5.0|I would give this book 50 stars!!! Excellent I read it twice and would probably read it again and I have never read any book twice!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|the pinterest app is easy to use.  pinning and browsing are simple and User friendly.  I'm glad it was finally made available on the kindle!
1591396190|5.0|I like the book. it is really clean and flawless. and I revived the book at the estimated time with ought any delay
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Could not stop reading it. Well worth it. Great characters and good storyline.<br />You should consider getting it now before the price will rise even further.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This movie is hysterical and I laughed throughout the whole movie.  Somewhat inappropriate but still great!  I had already seen it once in the theater but still enjoyed it.
B0091XRL86|4.0|I enjoyed this animation for its witty dialouge and good animation. Characters had some definition and storyline was inventive. The ending was a bit shallow and it all seemed too short but I still thought it did a decent job developing its plot.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Ok so the movie itself was good and everyone in this movie was good except for Kristan Stewart for some reason I don't know if its just me but she only has one facial expression and its the one that looks like she's always in excruciating pain she is a horrible actress and anyone who hires here is stupid she only has one facial expression really come on!!!!
B0090EKRKU|3.0|In the past I have always enjoyed Dr Seuss cartoons converted to video offerings but the Lorax was slightly dissapointing and less inventive than other films have been. Storyline was mundane and characters shallow loosing all interest for adults. Probably  OK for kids though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the story line that goes along with this novel. It's not just about the sex, that's what everyone make sit out to be. There's a real story here , and I recommend it!
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Kate Morton's \\"Forgotten Garden\\" was given to me as a present.  I went to my KIndle to see what other books she had written and downloaded several one of which was \\"\\"Distant Hours\\".  I had trouble putting it down.  The 3 sisters locked in each others lives, she is a master at weaving the characters in and out of the past and present.  Sometimes I had to stop and reread some of her \\"word pictures\\" they were so beautiful, hearing the stones of the castle talking, how the leaves and water sounded.  A beautiful book a wonderful read.  Waiting for her next book to arrive on my Kindle.
B009CPRYG2|5.0|Any fan of Batman will treasure this film. Don't let the part one fool you, this is a complete story. Voice acting, while not my favorite Bat-voice was top notch. This may be one of my favorite Bruce Timm/DC cartoon movies.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morten has done it again, woven a magic story with wonderful characters, I had trouble putting my KIndle down.  I love the way she does the present and then pops back into the past with various characters, I can't wait for her new book to arrive.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Love this game. 1 gripe. allow to make your move as soon as the board starts. For example 2-28, impossible to save hostage.
B008WHQZJI|5.0|I love PSBs and I was very happy to have a new album from them this year.  I liked this album, it has the classic PSB sound--they weren't trying to be experimental in this one--just pretty much straight forward PSB fare.  I take some comfort in that, I've bought pretty much all their albums and many of the singles since the 80s, I did not get their most recent collection of \\"B\\" sides yet as I have most of the material on it.  I usually hold out for the Limited Edition of all their records, but I didn't this time because the 2nd CD is simply instrumentals of the songs on the album, if I were I DJ who wanted to create extended mixes this would be a no brainer, but I was dissapointed that the extra did not contain the usual offerings of remixes along with several original tracks not found on the main album.  I was also a bit dissapointed in the length of the album, but I think I understand why they did not make it a standard length CD (as if there was such a thing anymore)--it is because they had a simultaneous release in vinyl.  Frankly I don't understand the resurgence of vinyl records with all their inherent flaws (surface noise, wear, scratches)--but I guess someone will buy it for the novelty of it.  I've gotten CD versions of all the early PSB albums because of the problems inherent in old school records.  You'd have thought that a lovely picture would have been created for the CD and LP--but instead we have a weird white block and something that looks like sparling water.  Oh well, I didn't buy the album for the art.  If you are a PSB fan this album is a \\"must have\\", it's sweet and comforting and upbeat.
B005LVR6ZA|5.0|I've actually read \\"Ubik\\" at least a dozen times - it's just about my favorite PKD book, although I love almost all of them. Great read, great surrealism (think Dali in words). If you like having your mind twisted, read this book!
B008EQIEWS|5.0|This is going to be one of my favorite movies. Talking about great action and awesome special fx. Loved it. Keep up the good work amazon.
159562015X|4.0|Not only is the book helpful, but it comes with a questionnaire and report that categorizes your strengths and how they can be maximized. It also explains other types of people, as well, and shows us who complements our strengths and who we need to avoid. Great for understanding people in business, families, marriages, churches etc.  It's a Wall Street Journal Bestseller for a reason.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I love this series there are so many twists and turns you do not know where it is going.  I'm hooked.
145210655X|5.0|A must-read for Star Wars fans; even the cover of this book makes me smile!  The author uses a hilarious concept to give us insight into the life of a young Luke Skywalker, through the eyes of an awkwardly patient Darth Vader.  I loved the familiar scenes used throughout the book.  All parents will immediately connect with the day to day incidents Vader finds himself navigating, and you'll laugh at his copius methods of dealing with them.  Not just for children, my 16 year old son, Luke, found it very entertaining.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was assigned as homework for my son's 6th grade class.  I also read the book to be able to discuss the book together.  He really enjoyed the book and it initiated many a conversations about science fiction books, science fiction movies, Nazis and different utopian societies.  I thought it was truly engaging and at every turn there was a \\"what's going to happen next\\" question.  We spent a lot of time discussing the decisions that were made by the characters and why they made those decisions.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|Ken has summarized years of bakers' knowledge -Didier, Michel, Ian, Chad, and his own- in one book.<br />He explained in a simple way, that is easy to understand.<br />Besides ingredients, temperature and time are considered.<br />Sample schedule is so convenient.<br />Why your dough has to finish at 78*F (26*C)?  Finally, a book that explains why this is so important.<br />One point I suggest to consider  in the Baker's formula is that, it should include the starting quantity of mature levain in the portion of Levain used as part of the info provided.<br />It is the first book that I have, in which you follow the instructions as they are written and you get what you see in the pictures.<br />One of the aspects I enjoyed the most, are the histories about his journey to get the level of expertise that he has developed.<br />As he wrote: \\"This kind of give-back and sharing...\\", Ken is taken his turn with this book.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I love bared to you. so i couldnt wait for this one to come out, By the time i got to the middle of the book i didnt even wanna finsh it, They keep playing with each other, and the sex parts where not even intense they were patheic, Dont get me wrong the book was well written, and i did finsh it and i will read the next one, but She didnt show no romance no nothing in this book. and She made me not like eva much she was being whinny and ugh.. and Cross too. but by the time i finshed the book i understood and everything made sense, but still wasn't my Fav at all... But i do reccommend people to read it, if you going to keep up with the series.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I'll admit, I'm a new fan, but I'm completely hooked.<br /><br />Last week, two different friends shared the hooky \\"Thrift Shop\\" and heartfelt \\"Same Love\\" and either one alone might not have been enough for me to look into the rest of their tracks, but combined, I was intrigued enough to figure out what this guy was about.  From there, the counter-culture-of-consumption messages in \\"Wing$\\" and hometown pride in \\"My Oh My\\" hit me and I was a confirmed fan.  \\"Can't Hold Us\\" is addictive.  I want to play \\"Starting Over\\" for everyone I know who's ever stumbled.<br /><br />I was excited not just to listen to the album all the way through, but to pay money for it and hope Macklemore and Ryan Lewis get to keep making a living doing what they love for a long, long time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book is a decent beach read, which is to say, don't expect too much from it. Gillian Flynn has created a fairly clever plot and a cast of characters who are well-defined as far as two-dimensional characters go. I turned the pages willingly and finished the book. The ending was clever too, if you keep in mind that this is fiction.<br /><br />Her failures: she is analogy-challenged. The first three pages contain some of the worst analogies I've read in a while. A woman's head that reminds her of a kernal of corn. Or consider the character who desires to open his wife's skull to see the centipedes (her thoughts) running wildly throughout her wrinkled brain matter. What the hell. Or would you like the vegetable dip that reminds you of semen. Good gawd.<br /><br />At other times, she strains to attract the attention of the reality show audience. How about a brother and sister together pantomiming a scene where the brother slaps his wife's face with his tumescent \\"wood-like\\" penis. For their fifth anniversary. This is not for me.<br /><br />But...if you can ignore all this tasteless stuff, the plot is satisfying enough and the text reads smoothly. As I said, take it to the beach, get a little dreamy on beach drinks, read it through a foggy lense, then leave it on the chaise lounge when you go back to your room.
B005NWHE0O|4.0|I was asked to read this book and a give an honest review. It's not a book I'd usually pick up, I must say. I think this is due to the fact I'd never heard of the winter sporting event \\"The Birkie.\\" After receiving the book I gave it a chance and I'm very glad I did. The book is very well written and has flow. The book is a memoir / Autobiography style of a sports minded man who's very open to travelling the world. I think by chapter 6 the story took hold of me but the chapters are short and it doesn't take long to arrive at this chapter. I think if you were into skying you'd be very into this story. I've never really been a big skier so I'm not sure I was part of the target market but I completed story. There are some graphic moments, which are well articulated, throughout the book where the writer shows excellent energy and pulls you into the story. It's an international read for the sport lovers, travellers and outdoor go getters.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was a good read with interesting characters that you found yourself wanting to know more about them and getting sucked in to the story that unfolds around them. It is along the lines of fifty shades of grey so if you liked that series I would highly recommend Bared to You.
B004WR125O|1.0|Absolutely ridiculous product.  I should have taken the advice of the other 1 start reviewers.  What a waste of time this product was.<br /><br />I've bought hundreds of items from Amazon and have NEVER left a review.  I am compelled to leave a review this time because it was such a crap product.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent amazon did an excellent job getting the movie to me quickly. I was worried it might not be a good showing because its an old movie.  The one thing that amazon could have improved on was I didn't know how the item would be shipped post office FedEx or ups. I only receive mail at my post office box. Didn't know if I could receive the item there.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|I've liked this band for most of my life and I own their entire collection. This album is bad. It's got no heart. Senior citizens singing about creeping on women, yeah that just even sounds bad..... They can still put out a good live show but the song writing is lame and as uninspired as it gets. It's just laughable at this point, old men in make up and heels, bow out now.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I have to admit as a dyed-in-the-wool fan of the original series, I had misgivings about this 2012 update.  First off, earlier this year, the trailer did nothing to make me want to buy--much less rent--this movie.  But, I was bored to death yesterday and decided to give it a chance.  And I'm glad I did--of the remakes I've seen of Dark Shadows, I enjoyed the movie immensely!  Go into it with an open mind and a sense of humor: you might surprise yourself.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|It is amazing book you can relate to it in your own life. You can use it in everyday life.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It was a good price and a great movie! I watched it several times the first week! I received the movie within a few days of it being shipped.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved this story. i shed many tears.. a must read for any parent. made me believe that there really are more nice people out there than mean people
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The writing is awful and the story line is stupid but the sex is fantastic.  So read the book but don't expect a literary masterpiece.
B0053O89JM|5.0|great dvd set -  loved it; great quality no scratches; arrived quickly - no<br />great dvd set -  loved it; great quality no scratches; arrived quickly - no problems
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I was anxiously awaiting to read this book and pre-ordered it.  Was disappointed as I love Reacher and hope his next adventure will bring back the Reacher we all love.
B006CDCWDM|5.0|I never really like these \\"co-authored\\" autobiographies from people you don't expect to have actually done much writing, but I'm glad I got this one because it does give you a very good sense of the way Nadal thinks, what's important to him, and what went on behind the scenes of some of his famous matches. I also enjoyed learning more about Nadal's relationship with his uncle and coach, particularly how it has evolved since Nadal's childhood.<br /><br />Oh, and the details about his previous injuries are particularly relevant given that he's currently (late 2012) out again.<br /><br />I'd say it's a must-read for anyone who's a big fan of Nadal, and a good read for fans of tennis in general.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I ABSOULETLY LOVE THIS BOOK! This is one of my favorites I cant wait for walking disaster. I love Travis hes awesome. Ive read this a million times and I cant stop. Abby is silly and America is even better. They all come together so well. And Travis family is hilarious.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|In my opinion couldn't write a better ending for the series! She also wrote The Host which was fantastic and not about teenage vampire love lol
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is literally the best hip-hop album I've ever listened to.  Each song is real, not some hyped up gangster bullshit.  You can feel the pain in Macklemore's lyrics when he sings about his problems with addiction.  You can feel his pride in his city and you can feel how much he loves rapping.  Macklemore kills almost every verse and so do the people that he collaborates with on the record.  You cannot forget about the beats behind these lyrics, which have been so beautifully orchestrated by Ryan Lewis.  The combination of the two creates a unique brand of music that sometimes feels like it's more than hip-hop.  Really wish I would've copped the gator skin deluxe edition with 18 songs instead of 15.  Macklemore deserves your attention.
034580404X|5.0|I bought the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy after listening to several co-workers discussing it. Arrived promptly, excellent price.  As I am older, I was actually looking over my shoulder to see if anyone was looking at what I was reading, but then saw a few others reading it also. The Greys are very active sexually. Once you kind of get used to that it is a great read. Almost finished the last volume. Excited to reach the end, but also disappointed that I am near the end and the story comes to an end. Have enjoyed it immencely.
1449410243|5.0|Read half of the comics on my Android tablet, and the quality of the Kindle version is terrific.  Very funny and will make you laugh out loud!  I have enjoyed TheOatmeal.com for a while, and this book was worth every penny.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I grew up loving the Alien series. Watching the Colonial Marines storm the processing plant, feeling the horror of the crew of the Nostromo, and watching as Ripley found a way to defeat the nightmare were some of the coolest things I had ever experienced. And when I heard that Prometheus was set in the same universe, I was ecstatic. But for those of you who are going to buy this movie expecting to see the Alien, you will be disappointed. However, if you have an open mind, a great imagination and are ready to watch a true prequel, then you will love Prometheus.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Not being the biggest fan of Kristen Stewart, I was really drawn to this movie by Charlize Theron. I was very interested to see how the story would be relayed with so much underlying darkness. I thought it was pretty well done. The special effects were nightmarish and the story was consistent enough that I wasn't constantly rolling my eyes. Still not the biggest fan of Kristen Stewart. No issues with the quality of the movie, really easy to order and watch this way.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I wasn't expecting this book to be anything like the Harry Potter series.  However, I had high expectations based on the fact that J.K. Rowling is an exceptional writer.  I heard that the book was very dark.  However, that was OK because the HP books had gotten darker and darker without losing that dry wit and sarcasm which made them so enjoyable. But I was very disappointed...<br /><br />This book is bleak and humorless.  If you loved reading \\"Ethan Frome\\" by Edith Wharton or anything by Henry James, then this is your kind of book with the added bonus of the most vile language you can imagine. I forced myself to read about a third but then I just couldn't go on. Frankly, I didn't connect to any of the characters and didn't really care what happened to them.  So, what was the point of going on???
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|at first the coin limit would have me playing 10 minutes a day... after I completed the first puzzle though I never dropped below 100 coins. I now have over 10000 (that last zero isn't an accident) so I can play as much as I want but the game moves at such a slow pace its losing appeal. I wish a puzzle piece would drop more than once every half hour.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I'm hooked on this program, Sons of Anarchy has gotten hold of me and I can't stop.  I love the series and couldn't wait for Netflix so I purchased season 4, not a bad price considering it was triple the price on Amazon at Barnes and Noble.
B004L03B3S|1.0|I love films with gay theme, can be positive affirmations. This however was a who cares regarding the story.  Poor quality disc from vendor, skipped at times but didn't matter as didn't feel was missing anything important or interesting.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|The game of thrones is great series.  Loved the books, the HBO series is well done, but a warning to viewers.  The content of the series is very adult.  I do not recommend that you watch this with children.  The sexual content is very graphic and total body nudity ( predominantly of women) is frequent and repetitive.  Sometimes pretty overdone. Other than that, a captivating story.
B005USZYDU|2.0|Bought this for my tween's book report. She found the story lacked an acutal story. Too many back plots and history and not enough action in the here and now. She found the ending very flat with no resolution. She said it felt like Grisham was setting up another book, but not looking to complete this one. I will be reading it next to see why she hated it, but truthfuly, I am sad she didn't enjoy her first and maybe her last Grisham novel.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all the Jack Reacher books. This one, I am afraid, was very disappointing. The story was fine but there were actually paragraphs I found so boring and full of detailed descriptions of unimportant trivia, that I scanned through them quickly. I have never had to do this with a Reacher novel before, so this is not a good sign. I could not help but feel Lee was filling the pages to get enough words to publish a full sized book which could almost have been written as a short story.<br /><br />Hopefully the author becomes aware that his biggest fans, the readers, were for the most part, disappointed in this work and will step it up for his next one. Perhaps his arrival in Virginia and a happily ever after would be a good point to end the Jack Reacher series????

B008EZVNO0|5.0|What a wonderful set of songs.  Perfect for kicking back with a glass of fine red wine after a long day working the coalface.  I had not listened to Van Morrison since Moondance (a very long time ago).  Apparently, I have been missing out.  It's time for me to get caught up on Mr Morrison.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This trilogy definitely kept my attention, and I believe had many messages as well as new experiences for women to enjoy. And it wouldn't be a bad idea to get your man reading it too. They might learn something they would benefit by.

B008RTE09S|1.0|How can this brand new product that was released today have reviews from 2004.  It seems this company, as sophisticated as they think they are, would have resolved this issue by now.  I would like to know how buyers of the Blu Ray like it as compared to the individuals who purchased the DVD.  Also, I would like to know if the buyers of the Super Deluxe Box Set think it is worth the money.  I have searched around on this web site and cannot figure out how to contact Amazon and let them know of the mix up.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|People seem to forget the older classics--especially after they're made into a movie.<br />This is definitely worth a re-read.  Enjoy it more the second time and if you have<br />teenagers, encourage them to read it--even if it is't  required in school.
B0076NAVNA|5.0|This is the best album of the decade. These are some of the best musicians in the world on this CD.<br /><br />Well worth the money...<br /><br />BUY IT AND SUPPORT GREAT MUSIC!
B008OJ291W|4.0|This is a ELO collection done by their leader only.  Jeff Lynne wanted to re-record these songs, because he thought they would sound better with a fresh dab of paint, i'm sorry i've been a Jeff Lynne fan for 35 years, but he didn't need to do this.  (Maybe 12 new songs next time).  \\"Do Ya\\", sounds pretty good, \\"Point Of Know Return\\", his only new composition, is a very strong song,  \\"10538 Overture\\", is quite good also.  Please Jeff time to let differences between you and Bev Bevan stop.  Get back together with Bev, Richard and maybe Roy Wood and do another project.  Looking foreword to 2013 and more new Jeff Lynne.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I love this movie. it is entertaining from start to finish. great editing. great acting. everyone is really good. i would watch this over and over again.
B008N2Z1L0|5.0|Jakob Dylan and The Wallflowers, 6th studio offering, first in 7 years, act like there having fun on \\"Glad All Over\\".  Very upbeat collection, great tunes in, \\"Hospital For Sinners\\", \\"First One In The Car\\", \\"Reboot The Mission\\", with Clash member Mick Jones, \\"Love Is A Country\\", the swift back and forth of \\"The Devils Waltz\\", a 60's sounding nugget \\"It Won't Be Long (Till We're Not Wrong Anymore)\\" and \\"One Set Of Wings\\".  Best album since 1996's \\"Bringing Down The Horse\\", in my opinion.  This release reminds me of  Cracker's release \\"Sunrise In The Land Of Milk And Honey\\", in 2009.

B008Y5OW20|5.0|Lynnetober fest starts today October 9th.  Jeff Lynne releases his second solo recording 22 years after \\"Armchair Theatre\\".  This is a release of 11 cover tunes from his younger days of youth, growing up in the 1950's.  Jeff still sounds fantastic at almost 65 years-old.  The music is superior as usual.  Good tunes in \\"Mercy, Mercy\\", \\"She\\", the Charlie Chaplin cut \\"Smile\\", the Roy Orbison chestnut \\"Running Scared\\", the burner \\"Let It Rock, \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\", which totally sounds like he is back in the Idle Race.  and magical upbeat \\"Beyond the Sea\\", the twang of \\"So Sad\\" and a smooth version of \\"At Last\\".  This album is short at 27 minutes,, but songs were short back in the 50's.  I've heard he has an album ready for 2013.  Also 3 remastered with bonus tracks albums due in 2013, \\"Zoom\\", \\"Armchair\\" and \\"ELO Live\\", so 4 albums in 2013!  Nice to have Jeff back in the spotlight.

B0053O8AQE|5.0|This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen, I felt like the season flew by, and if I didn't always work so late on Mondays I would totally be watching season 2, but I guess I will have to wait for that to come out on DVD so I can get a hell-a good dealio on here again!  I got this set for such a greA+ price, the seller was private and I was nervous (he was my first private seller) but he was tremendous!  shipped within a week, I was watching my show, excellent condition, when he said like new he meant LIKE NEW!  still in the original plastic, the whole 9.  I felt like I just stole it for cheap off a rack at Walmart!  if you like quirky comedies with quick witted humor - this is the show for you!  plus, how can you go wrong with something written by Whitney?!

B0015DYIH2|3.0|Ok, i hate saying anything bad about a book unless it's 'drop dead on the floor bad',but i had to get this out. *MEDIUM SPOILERS* First, i love Twilight. I really do. Uhh..... the actual review.. where do i begin?? Twilight~ perks. Easy read. New Moon~ action. Overall good book. Eclipse~ same. Good book when you're bored. Breaking Dawn... First off, i feel Ms. Meyer didn't really explain the honeymoon that well. I couldn't really grasp that mental image. I spent roughly 1 hour last night reading reviews on this book last night. And i hate to say it, but i agree with some of it. Overuse of adjectives. I think she over described some things & left out some others.<br />And why are all 3 books wholly Bella's POV and then they plop some of Jacob's in the middle of Breaking Dawn?? Not that i didn't like it, but still.<br />Also, does it ALL have to revolve aroud Bella?? What about the rest of Edward's family? I am a HUGE Carlisle & Esme fan. And of course i adore everyone else as well..... if you have other characters, involve them in the story. Even if they're 'minor'. I greatly detest the fact that Stephenie included so little of the other character's and their pasts.<br />Moving on. This might be a little off topic... Why in the name of the world did Steph write about Bree?!?! She was no more important than the rest of the newborn coven!!! Sorry 'bout that. Back on track. Remember how each book had it's own little point of action? That became extict in Breaking Dawn. That one spark in hope of excitemet for the battle with the Volturi. Well, i can tell you that hope was smothered faster than you could say wow.<br />All i asked was for maybe a chapter or 2 of action to satisfy my lust, but nooooo. They turned all Cap'n McBlabmouth on us.. and then what? They just LEAVE. Plus, couldnt've Bella had a wee bit more trouble controlling her newborn instincts?? Again, missing the excitment. I'm deeply sorry Ms. Meyer, but it wasn't your best work.

B000001GX5|5.0|\\"Your Eminence, do you think this is wise?\\"<br /><br />BANG - BANG - BANG - the prisoners in the nearby mess-hall were smashing their iron-cups against the tables.<br /><br />\\"Tut, tut, Cato, my trusty Oriental manservant,\\" replied Father Melchizedek OP, the High Priest of Period Practice.  \\"What would you know of such matters? You underestimate the orphic power of music. These inmates here at San Quentin need to hear some historically informed performances of music. It will improve their characters no end! Now hold up that mirror while I adjust my mitre!\\"<br /><br />\\"But your Eminence, the earlier concert at Folsom Prison was a disaster!\\"<br /><br />The cleric waved his hands breezily as he donned his pectoral cross.<br /><br />\\"I will hear none of it, Cato. Now, where is Corporal Hogwood's Clippity Hearts Club Band - my back-up ensemble?\\"<br /><br />\\"They're running somewhat late, your Eminence.\\"<br /><br />\\"No matter! Let's make music. Pass me my lute - chop, chop! I am going to start with a suite by the famous 16th Century composer Melchior Neusidler. After that, let's reward our audience with a spruce performance of Buxtehude's `O Fr&ouml;liche Stunden' . The inmates will swoon to it!\\"<br /><br />The head goon put his head around the corner.<br /><br />\\"Preacher, move your hairy backside! Now! There's a riot brewing!\\"<br /><br />Ever so daintily, the cleric skipped through the door and onto the stage which had been temporarily erected in the mess-hall. The welcome was more vociferous than warm. The High Priest of Period Practice called for calm; it was not forthcoming. Undaunted, he launched into the Neusidler's 'Herr gott nun sey gepreyset'. For whatever reason, the lute music galvanised the inmates into action; pushing past the cordon of guards, the biggest of them leapt up onto the stage, seized the cleric and dragged him away to the laundry.<br /><br />\\"You must do something about this!\\" the Warden hissed at Cato. \\"They'll level the place!\\"<br /><br />The situation needed to be defused. With a sigh, the trusty manservant pulled out this Karajan disc - perhaps Father Melchizedek was right on the money re the orphic power of music. A public address system was  nearby. Cato inserted it and pushed the play-button. Now he could have turned to the Respighi works. The Fountains of Rome and the Pines of Rome require panache above all: Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic, assisted no end by the warm analogue recording from the late Seventies, deliver in spades. One is actually let dumbfounded by the orchestral colour and virtuosity. How the Tritons blow their horns in the matinal light! Vesperal indeed is the `I pini del giancolo'. The tread of the legions in `I pini della via Appia' is so ominous as to suggest that Herbie has brought in one of his old Tiger Tanks into the studio and a Nebelwerfer to boot. The collection also includes the Ancient Airs and Dances by the same-said composer: as performed here, they are relics of courtly elegance from a bygone era.<br /><br />But the real treasure here is Boccherini's La Musica Notturna della strade di Madrid. It was recorded in the late Sixties and issued on a famous LP which has never been replicated in this digital era: the star at the end of the decade indeed. Karajan breaks all the rules. There is no greater anachronism in his discography - and that's saying something.  Just think: the Berlin Philharmonic, however thinned down it might be, playing a transcription of a Boccherini string quintet. It should not work but the opposite is the case. Again, this is the reason why we all listen to music: to be transfigured and afire with longing.<br /><br />In this hour of need, Cato turned to this piece. One by one, the prisoners fell silent, benumbed by the magic of the music. It was akin to the Shawshank Redemption when Andy Dufresne plays the duet from the Marriage of Figaro to his fellow inmates.<br /><br />The music came to an end. Silence prevailed. It was broken by a wail. Yes, it was Father Melchizedek in the laundry. He was singing the `Burning Ring of Fire' in so many words.was Father Melchizedek in the laundry.

B008PNBU30|4.0|I hesitated to write this review after my first play-through of this CD and I am glad that I did.  I really did not like this CD at first, as it is very different from Three Days Grace's previous works.  I gave the disc a few extra spins and the CD began to grow on me.  The single, 'Chalk Outline', is one of the best tracks on the CD.  It has a very grungy sound to it and nothing else on the CD has the same flavor.  My favorite new track is 'Operate.'  It is very catchy and features the outstanding vocals of Adam that I have come to expect out of 3DG over the years.  I also enjoyed 'Happiness'.  I feel these 3 tracks are the closest you will get to 3DG's old sound and are great tracks to use to transition into some of the other songs.<br /><br />As for the rest of the album, there are a lot of powerful songs and you can really see 3DG evolving here.  The rest took a bit longer for me to adapt to, but at this point I enjoy probably 80% of the CD.  I am sure that number will continue to grow as I have only had the album for 4 days now, and it seems to get better with every listen.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|This review is for the movie itself, not for the actual DVD/Blu-ray packaging of the product.<br /><br />When I heard that this movie was being released, I was excited.  So excited, that I actually avoided all reviews/previews/etc. so that when I saw it, on opening night no less, I could see it with my own eyes and not through the filter of other's opinions.<br /><br />Well, lets start with the good; this movie has great production values. The cinematography, the special effects, the acting, all good. I really liked Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and even Charlize Theron (whom I usually don't like) in this movie.  I also like Logan Marshall-Green as the boyfriend, as he struggles to make his parts in this script seem believable.<br /><br />The problem is the script. This movie is flawed in basic character action and motivation. It looks really good, but it doesn't make sense.  It's kinda like a music video or a dream sequence. There's just no reason for the characters to act the way they do in the movie. All actions are done in a forced, very artificial way to advance a bone-headed plot. The geologist/mapping expert gets lost. Someone takes off their helmet just because there's oxygen in the atmosphere. A biologist is scared of a dead body, then tries to pet an obviously hostile space snake.<br /><br />It's not just the human characters, either, there's no reason for the Engineers to do what they do in the movie. Still, the \\"monster\\" going around eating/impregnating/infecting people makes more sense than a woman not realizing she should get out of the way of a massive moving object about to squish her.<br /><br />If you're looking for \\"hard-science\\" sci-fi, look elsewhere. Black goo as a evolution accelerant is really the least of the scientific problems with this movie. You've got corporate-owned light-speed vehicles in only a century? In real life, we can't even fund the space shuttle!<br /><br />And then there are the subtle, overall themes of the movie. Yes,I've read the Dec. 31, \\"space-jesus\\" explanations of the movie; again, it's forced, and it still doesn't fit. And high-brow ideas don't make up for the deep flaws elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall, there are just too many holes in this movie, and not just the kind left on purpose for a sequel, or even the parts cut out like the TED speech. This was a very expensive disappointment. This movie is worth renting for the acting and visual effects, perhaps worth buying on sale, but not worth buying or paying full price in the theaters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome story line really enjoyed all 3 books. would recommend to any age group as i am 40 and just began reading a few months ago.  I saw the movie first, there is so much more in the books.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Recently started going through these episodes again after viewing season two several times and it's really a new experience knowing more about the land of Westeros (a sort of parallel medieval England, Europe, and North Africa with a Hadrian's Wall of its own in its northlands). Amazing how much younger the characters seem in early episodes compared to season two, at least the ones who live. The most striking thing about this series is just how real and true it all seems despite the fantasy elements, from the nastiness of politics to the brutality of war and the justifications everyone makes for their decisions. Much like real life you'll find no one is an innocent here but you'll be rooting for some and loathing others nonetheless, and that's the great part of this show, almost every character has a compelling backstory and they all seem to be fighting for something missing in their lives, from love to power to dragons. Of all the cable shows out there, this has been the only one I've bothered with. George R.R. Martin's source material is certainly a plus to have backing this series, much like Tolkien's books were to Peter Jackson's LOTR films, so it has that going for it instead of screenwriters just making stuff up on the fly. Don't miss this, it's a powerhouse of a series.

B0087DFIYA|4.0|Payback is probably my favorite Mel Gibson movie, besides Braveheart.  This is essentially the same thing- a superb, crafty, anti-hero survivor.  Of course, while he doesn't have a whole lot of humanity left, he does find his reason to do something good, and does it.  I would say this is better than Payback in a lot of ways.  If it wasn't for the fact that it's sorta formulaic for a Mel Gibson movie, I would give it 5 stars.

The new Blu Ray edition is beautifully done, no doubt<br />a new set of millions will be clinging to the sand this year. I'll probably watch it every week or two, because<br />the acting, lighting and direction are terrific, but I'll still swim in the ocean, after all it is a just a movie!!
B004EWFUQY|5.0|So far I have lost 6 pounds in the first week.  I love that this is a life changer.  It teaches you how to keep the weight off, which doesn't happen with most diet plans.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addicting. A great way to pass time and have loads of fun.<br /><br />I recommend this app for sure. Happy Coin Dozing

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest!!! I have been using it for recipe and drink ideas every since I downloaded!!! I have recommended it to everyone I know
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Loved it! Looking forward for the 3rd  book. It starts a few years after the first book ends, and now the story tells us what happens with the characters' sibilings who grow up as long as the story goes on as  they take part on the real events that happened. The fiction mixes with reality in a very smart way!
B008I3R2VG|2.0|Battle Born, boot to the floorboard and heavy octane fuel injected has been rolling across the desert for the last two years ... we just haven't been able to see it through the heat waves rising off the two lane blacktop that spirits through an endless array of weathered washed out voiceless small towns that make up the larger part of Nevada.  The album is as epic as two amateur boxers squaring off for the first time in their careers, knowing that win or lose, the blood in their mouths will never taste this sweet again ... or at least that's what The Killers would have us believe.<br /><br />The Killers are shooting for something grand here, something larger than the neon lights of Las Vegas, something that will raise them to dizzying withering heights, filling the album with driving echoing guitars, with sonically fueled ideals and imagery ... yet for all the impossible leaps Battle Born just doesn't hold a single as strong as \\"All The Things That I've Done\\" or \\"Somebody Told Me,\\" from their 2004 Hot Fuss release.  And while frontman Brandon Flowers sings of such lofty aspirations, I for one just don't find an eternal honest truth to this music, though I'm sure he does, with his Mormon values credited for centering and guiding his life ... and perhaps too much of this album.<br /><br />If nothing else, Battle Born is some of the finest religiously oriented and life value guided music out there ... and for just that reason, and that they sound like Journey want-to-be's, it ain't for me.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great thriller from Lee Child.  I couldn't read this book fast enough.  Interesting how everything comes together in the end.
B0089IGUP4|3.0|As brilliantly good as Handwritten is, there's only one reason to score this album, an album filled with lush driving power chords, sustained strained vocals, introspective thoughts, and banners unfolded against the wind, and that's for the song \\"Mae\\" ... a hands down masterpiece tucked in at the end of the release, standing like a beacon, a riveting direct young man's answer to the Beach Boys' single \\"That's Why God Made The Radio.\\"  And that song alone slapped a mile wide smile across my face, because \\"Mae\\" isn't what I expected, and to that end it shines like a diamond.<br /><br />Yes, the rest of the album will rock you back and chase smoke rings into the ether, but when all is said and done, it's all more of the same ... Certainly refined and reflective, but playing host to what we've all come to love and respect from Gaslight Anthem.  It's at this point in their career that I develop my own personal best from Gaslight, and \\"Mae\\" will slide in right at the top.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This was the first blu-ray disc purchased for our brand new Sony and first ever blu-ray player ([[ASIN:B006U1YUZE Sony BDP-S590 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi]]) and I couldn't be happier with the choice. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I've been using our new smart blu-ray player to stream episodes of \\"Downton Abbey,\\" \\"Gosford Park,\\" \\"The Forsyte Saga,\\" and \\"He Knew He Was Right\\" (Netflix only for now), but hadn't actually seen anything on Blu-Ray.  So continuing the never ending pursuit of British costume dramas, I purchased P&P and probably have watched it about five times in the first week of owning it, including the director's cut. I'd only seen the film once in the theater when it came out but was blown away by Keira Knightley's beauty and snappy repartee; the quiet, smoldering masculinity of Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy; and one of the most romantic happy endings ever put to film.<br /><br />Add to all that the lush scenery, the beautiful costumes, and the sumptuous interiors, and you have the makings of an absolutely gorgeous film that would make anyone want to move to the beautiful English countryside, even for the Bennet's deteriorating working farmhouse, itself a National landmark in England. Not having had the pleasure (yet) of seeing the Colin Firth version and never having read the book (egads!), I couldn't help but be captivated by Keira Knightley as the witty Elizabeth. She more than holds her own throughout, but most especially in the confrontation scene with Dame Judi Dench's Lady Catherine, which is no small accomplishment for a young actress sharing the screen with such a legend.<br /><br />For those of us in the DVR age, having the ability to rewind and make sure to hear exactly what's being said is what blu-ray discs/DVDs are made for with films like this.  The pleasure in watching it is making sure to get the language that is being employed to move the plot forward or to slice and dice another character. Everyone is in complete control of his or her word choices and has the enviable ability of making feelings perfectly known but with subtlety. Don't we all wish we had such writers in our heads!<br /><br />I look forward to seeing Keira Kightley as \\"Anna Karenina\\" in Joe Wright's upcoming film adaptation this fall, their third collaboration. He may be going a bit Baz Luhrmann for that film from what I've seen so far, but with  P&P (and \\"Atonement\\"), he created such a gorgeous film, especially in scenes like the one where Lizzie stares at herself in the mirror, facing the possibility that she was overly harsh in letting her own prejudices fillet Darcy in one of the film's most sensuous and electric scenes. The score, just as in \\"Atonement,\\" is a leitmotif throughout the film and I'm almost tempted to buy the soundtrack. This is one beautiful piece of filmmaking that may supplant my two favorite movies of all time.

B007KCG7MQ|3.0|\\"Lucky That Way\\" from Analog Man pretty much sums up the life of Joe Walsh ... James Gang, his high flying stoner band from the late 60's and early 70's was laced with enough guitar riffs to keep us all floating in the stratosphere forever, was rejected by The Beatles' Apple Corporation, and he's now, of all things, Ringo Starr's brother in law, with Ringo playing on this, the fist solo release Joe's given us in twenty years.  After riding with the James Gang, he stumbled head long into The Eagles, a career in and of itself, one that's given him a lifetime of recognition for his impeccable guitar work, and sonic sensibilities.  Even with all this fortune and fame he hasn't lost his sense of humor, complaining as he has for years about the coming of the digital age, yet recording this outing without one inch of analog tape.  He goes on to sing, backed with harmonies from analog heros Crosby and Nash [without Stills], about his family, love, and new found sobriety.  With Jeff Lynne stepping in to both produce and play, it prompts me to wonder why no one ever thought of adding Joe to the Traveling Wilburys' lineup.<br /><br />The album's been stocked with rock and simmering funk, he morphs the James Gang classic \\"Funk 49\\" into \\"Funk 50,\\" complete with lyrics this time, while infectious slick guitar licks grace songs that will dance across your head, swirling back memories from the 70's, where warm summer nights melted into endless days of cloudless sun, flying Frisbees, and the pockets of fringed jean shorts were filled with with righteous bud.<br /><br />Analog Man stands as a singular event in the solo career of Joe Walsh, every song is worth your time, each track is lush, and highly polished.  And while this may sound like the man has aged and mellowed, he's still rock's clown prince, showing that nothing, not even the man himself, should be taken too seriously.  Yes, \\"Life's Been Good\\" for Joe Walsh, and Joe Walsh has been very good to us.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerll Kesler
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed the mystery and puzzle aspects of the game a lot.  The hidden object portions got a bit too forced by the end of the game,  but I still really enjoyed the game.
B000002I2G|4.0|In August of 1969 Rolling Stone wrote, \\"The Soft Parade is worse than infuriating, it's sad.  It's sad because one of the most potentially moving forces in rock has allowed itself to degenerate.  A trite word, but true.\\"  Well I don't know about all that, what I do know is that Rolling Stone Magazine seemed to be embracing other soft breezes of the time, but for some reason felt it necessary to unhinge The Doors for the path they were taking.<br /><br />August of 1969 saw the unfolding of Woodstock, it also saw me folding as much as I could stuff into an olive drab footlocker, stenciling my name across the top, and shipping it out ahead of me ... destination, Vietnam.  Like Morrison, I seem to have stepped off the planet as well, though with a stack of musical rags under my arm.  Let me sort through some of these issues and clippings and tell you what filtered though my head that hot August in the summer of 1969, and attempt to show you why The Doors had no choice but to release this album.<br /><br />-Morrison moves full throttle from the loveliness of psychedelics, to the bottomless pit of booze ...<br />-Morrison even more than before doubts the quality of his voice, even though The Village Voice credits him as the vocalist of the year ...<br />-Morrison moves from Elvis Presley as his favorite singer to Frank Sinatra and the seamy underbelly of Las Vegas ... truly the town that never sleeps ...<br />-Morrison is no longer just the music, Morrison has become a spectacle, he's unwinding and loosing himself ...<br />-Morrison is going crazy, no longer is he able to separate himself from the stage, the studio, or on the street, he's become a reflection that's colliding with the mirror, and shattering ...<br />-Ray Manzarek and Morrison publish individual songwriting credits ...<br />-The Soft Parade takes nearly a year to finish, with the band doing literally hundreds of takes, butting headlong with Rothchild's incessant need for perfection, seamlessness, and a smooth bright quality that Fleetwood Mac would soon embrace, but due to equipment limitations just out of reach, The Soft Parade was never able to find that full bodied, fill the room sound ...<br /><br />So when people tell you that The Doors have lost their edge on The Soft Parade, creating an album that's too clean, too filtered, and lacks direction ... to them I'd say, that with the circumstances of the times, The Doors created an exceptional body of work that may not come to be appreciated for many years yet, though when it is, there will be lots jumping on board to save face.  The biggest thing to come out of The Soft Parade, was the one hundred and eighty degree turn the band did on Waiting For The Sun, and more than returning to their edgy roots.<br /><br />Now, I've had this argument before, and at this point, what the other person says here is, \\"But Jenell, Soft Parade is limited to a mere three great tracks ... Touch Me, Shaman's Blues, and Wild Child.\\"  And I'm supposed to argue with that?  No way, I'll agree with that and then ask them to show me other albums that have three killer songs like those, along with the brilliant [so called] fluff of Touch Me, Wishful Sinful, or Tell All The People.  The Soft Parade was an unparalleled success, it may not have been what the fans, who only want more of what they already know, wanted ... but never the less, it's a hands down masterpiece that deserves its place in musical history.<br /><br />The album charted at number 6 in the US, and did almost nothing in Europe, though if one considers that The Doors themselves did little to support the release, that's a home run in anyone's book.  Are there albums from The Doors that I'd suggest people listen to before The Soft Parade?  Of course, and there are albums by The Beatles I'd suggest people listen to before Sgt. Pepper.  Add to all of this the fact that The Doors so flawlessly meshed what they'd developed here, using it to resounding acclaim on L.A. Woman, and I thinkthere are a lot of folks who sadly just want to downplay this period in the history of The Doors.  So, while The Doors may not have blown a 50-amp fuse here on The Soft Parade, I certainly got what I needed.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerthere are a lot of folks who sadly just want to downplay this period in the history of The Doors.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I did not see this in the theater, but waited for it come out on Blu-Ray.  Stupid me, I pre-ordered from Amazon and just received, watched it. My title explains my feelings.  The only thing I hope comes out of this is that someone makes a movie, different writer and director, of where the Aliens came from and why they created humans.<br /><br />There are number of things that make this unbelievable; e.g., David learns the language by studing early earth languages, but how can he read the Engineer's writing, as the Engineer's spaceship crashes and roll towards them, Vickers and Shaw run in the same direction as the roll instead of to the side and out of its' path.<br /><br />After wathing the extended and deleted scenes with the commentary on it was apparent that all these deletions were done for time, even if they helped explain the movie better.  This was done to keep the time to about 2 hours which allows more showing at the theater - pure profit motive.  I think they did this because they knew that they had a real lousy movie and needed to make their money ASAP.<br /><br />Reviewers that gave this a 4 or 5 star only proves the point that America is becoming the stupidest country in the world.  Most of these reviewers are most likely under 30, and would not recognize a good story if it bit them on the butt.<br /><br />Ran into another problem, not sure if it is the discs or my friends Samsung 3D Blu-ray player.  My friend wanted to see this movie so I lent him my copy, but it would not play on his Samsung 3D Blu-ray players (has two), it said that his players need a software update, but when he went fic WiFi Samsung said that there was no update available.  On both players the software was at version 2012/07/24_001029.  He is contacting Samsung and he is wondering if anyone else had this problem with the Samsung player for Promethus 3D Blu-ray.
B008N2Z1L0|3.0|Glad All Over will stop you dead in your tracks, so don't go thinking you're gonna hear more of the memories that reside on the jukebox as a whispering of what you're about to discover here.  Glad All Over, the first release from the band in seven years, following the two solo albums by Jacob Dylan that sailed quietly under the radar, presents The Wallflowers rebooted, kicked into high gear, full of colourful imagery, and strung out on verbal and guitar hooks that splash across the screen with the raw urgency of \\"Rock The Casaba,\\" and features Mick Jones on two tracks.<br /><br />Glad All Over hits like this is the very first time you're hearing the band, coming at you with a power that nearly erases their past low keyed outings as little more than Blonde On Blonde meandering nods ... finally coming to grips with their own talent, one that's filled with a huge sharp engulfing sound more suitable for the big stage, and not the small clubs.  Now ... there are going to be many who don't understand why a band some twenty years into their career would adopt a neo-punk attitude, and craft songs that stand in complete juxtaposition to the etherial atmospheric visions that both defined and graced their first releases.  Considering those aspects, this is not a comfortable album, but one that certainly reflects the times and world situation, and it's all by choice and design, making this just one more pocket for the boys to draw from, even if it is a bit out of their and our comfort zone.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is the current master of the sweeping epic.  This is a great follow-up to Fall of Giants.  It was that book that convinced me to get a Kindle as it weighed close to 4 lbs! Got \\"Winter\\" on Kindle and it is great. Follett is very good at weaving his characters into historical action in a plausible way.  Great read.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read it with a Book Club and I don't think I would have chosen to read it otherwise. It is now one of my all time favourite books. The characters are well developed.I felt as though I knew them personally. The plot is fast paced and thought provoking.The language is naturally old fashioned but if anything that adds to the appeal of the book. A great read. I will be reading more of Wilkie Collins' books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good but the ending leaves a lot of questions about the characters unanswered. i feel the first two books were better
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read Bared to You and loved it.  Got to know the characters and find uot some unsettling secrets existed.  I was anxious to read this one and finished it the day I downloaded it....couldn't  put it down.  I will admit I skipped some of the long discriptions of places.  It wasn't horribly overrought with these sections but there were way more than I was willing to wade through.  I do need some of that to help me be there in the world with the characters, but I was very anxious to see/hear what was going on with our two main characters and how the mysteries were coming along.  It was definitely emotional and I was angry with both of them and wanted to swat them with a bat myself at times.  Sheese, how can two people be such idiots.  It was nice when a police character finally sort of lays out the whole mystery solved at basially the end of the book.  It did help clear some things up that sure needed to be cleared.  THe book does get you agitated and worked up......but I think that is a sign of good writing, no? You are there with them and you FEEL the anger, rage, hurt, frustration.....it can impact your day.  That is one reason I read it on a day off and made sure to finish it.  I liked it.  I'm not sure I can say which book I liked better.  They were at a different point in the arc of the characters so they are two different books to me and I am glad I have had the opporunity to read both, I enjoyed both very much.  And yes, both have hot sex scenes..that is a given I think.  I think my 5 stars are deserved.
0307887448|5.0|I picked up this book based on Hugh Howey's recommendation.  And I am very glad I did.  This was one of the most fun and riveting books I have read.  And since I've been reading science fiction for decades, that is saying a lot.  A quick summary (other reviewers have much longer and more detailed summaries) is of a near-future world where conditions are terrible, but much of the population escapes to an on-line computer virtual reality world.  While the story indicates this on-line world is as central to business and commerce as the internet is today, the focus of the story is an 18 year old social misfit who spends his time playing his on-line character Parzival while searching for an on-line prize in an on-line game that is built on video games and on-line games that have and do actually exist. However, this isn't a \\"technology is bad\\" or \\"social message\\" book.  It is far more enjoyable than either of those genres.<br />The main character is not only believable, but feels \\"real\\".  The author subtly shows the main character maturing, and also throws in hints about why the world is getting in worse shape.  All this in a fast-paced book that keeps building in intensity.  By the last third of the book, I had to force myself to stop reading for mundane \\"Real Life\\" activities like work and sleep.<br /><br />I can't recommend this strongly enough.
B006INDGFE|5.0|I know there are a lot of reviews saying this was just like the first movie, but seriously... what did you expect?!  This is a great movie, don't expect a deep plot but be ready to laugh your guts out!!  Will watch again and again!

B002RI9YE6|5.0|I have enjoyed every book of Ishiguro's that I have been able to read on Kindle and in my opinion this is his best.  I loved the clever structure of the narrative, the characters and the undercurrent of unrequited romance, but best of all I loved the journey through the English country-side, his vivid descriptions bringing alive memories of past times and journeys.

First off, the set itself is in great condition and the case is very beautiful.<br /><br />Secondly, and most importantly, the series itself is just so well done.  The science mixed with religion mixed with magic is just seamless.  The storyline holds you tight and never lets go as you delve deeper into the worlds of Philip Pullman.<br /><br />Get these books now!
B001BKVWYQ|5.0|This is such a wonderful vinyl. The music is mind blowing to say the least. A must have for music collectors.
034580404X|4.0|This is a novel made up of three \\"levels\\". One thing for sure, you have to be very open minded. There are explicit sexual desriptions and quite a bit of curse words. I found myself, shall I say \\"enlightened\\" to a lot of sexual things I never knew about. You will get a full course of sex education. But the story itself is not all about the sex, more \\"why\\" the sex.<br />I must say that the first novel of the trilogy drove me nuts because of the over use of \\"he frowned\\" or \\"I frown\\" to describe every facial expression. It just seemed so over done to me but then again maybe it is just me. I found myself a little irritated with \\"tight lipped\\" in the second novel so yeah, it's me. Had I been the editor, it would have been changed.<br />Bottom line, great reading, not something you would read with the kids nearby, but entertaining.<br />I heard a rumor of a possible movie, I hope they don't do it. There is NO Way possible to make it as good as the book because it would have to be X-rated. Personaly, I can't imagine any actor and actress who values their careers performing the sex acts described in the trilogy.<br />Love the books!

B008G8SFGO|5.0|Say what you will, but the new album is not only proof that KISS is the \\"Hottest Band in the World!\\", but it is proof that they will continue to hold that title for eternity.<br /><br />The proof is in the bluesy opening strains of the very first song. KISS has never cared about what the critics said, and they continue to inspire those of us who have been there throughout the decades (YES...DECADES!) to love them for who they are. They don't try to preach, spill politics, or whine about their childhoods...they simply play rock and roll that sounds good and sweeps you up.<br /><br />This album is solid from start to finish. Tommy and Eric are two of the best \\"hired guns\\" in the business. Turn it on, turn it up, and just enjoy some good old rock and roll.

B008JFC6F0|5.0|For me, listening to Tame Impala's first album consistently conjured up the image of the Ayers rock, the big red mountain in the middle of the Australian outback, at sunset (or sunrise), the band playing alone and powerful and majestic on the sands in front of it.  \\"Innerspeaker\\" gave me a sense of isolation but in the most romantic and idealistic sense.  Tame Impala's newest release also creates a sense of isolation but thanks to the aggressive recording techniques used this time around- in your face drums, creative channel mixing (even more so than on the previous album), manipulated vocals, layers of keyboards- the isolation is a little more disturbing. \\"Lonerism\\" sounds exactly like you think music described as Lonerism should sound like- unlike anything else.<br />  And it is genius.  Opening track \\"Be Above It\\" occupies a musical landscape somewhere between \\"Kid A\\" Radiohead and any era Animal Collective, yet it sounds like Tame Impala.  No chorus, no verse, or anything resembling structure appears to exist- it is just 3:22 of drums, distorted vocals, and psych energy.  \\"Endors Toi\\" kicks off with some familiar guitar sounds before veering off into symphonic rock, not too far removed from The Flaming Lips more eccentric stuff.  Yet again, it sounds like Tame Impala.  The two tracks released prior to the album's release- \\"Apocalypse Dream\\" and \\"Elephant\\"- each display two of the bands strengths.  The former is an over-the-top, upbeat, prog rocker that embraces the term 'epic' while the latter is dirty, aggressive, bass-driven blues rock.<br />  The stand out track (at least for today; this will probably change next week) is \\"Keep On Lying\\".  It starts off with a fade-in, already in progress, sounding like a subdued, lazy \\"99 Tears\\".  For the first couple minutes, nothing much changes.  Then slowly, an oddly mixed guitar enters, along with chattering voices, and before you know it, the song is lost in a musical house of mirrors (and blessed with some of  the album's most exciting guitar playing).  It sounds ridiculous, but it is.  And again, it is genius.<br />  Needless to say, Tame Impala has avoided a sophomore slump.  Heading in a new direction while still sounding like Tame Impala is quite an accomplishment, and also a rewarding and exhilarating listen for their fans.  And I haven't even mentioned the Led Zeppelin stomp of \\"Mind Mischief\\" or the fact that the last track is a piano waltz.  Genius stuff.um's most exciting guitar playing).

0525953728|4.0|The author has written an engaging and 'easy-to-read' account of his background, training, and participation in the OBL mission.  His matter of fact descriptions of the 'rugged road' to achieving mental and physical toughness to become a Seal is an inspiration to all who reject the 'whining and soft' life that most Americans experience. The author's respect for his comrades comes through clearly and he achieves this without bravado or bragging. But perhaps the greatest testament of this book is the reassurance that there are enough dedicated and committed citizens who know the genuine threats throughout the world to our way of life and are willing to be the 'tip of the spear,' to protect us.  Thank you for your service!

It's like a combination of Stross' singularity writings and Foucoult's secret societies, all the while channeling The Princess Bride (just not couched in a bedtime story). It even has a moral. One other feature I find appealing: it has a beginning and an end. It doesn't try to fill 550 pages with secondary characters and a setup for a septology. Instead, it simply tells a story, and tells it well.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book had me from the first page. The author set it out right from the start that no \\"top secret\\" information and none of his brothers were in jeopardy of risking their identities. This book was so well written and kept me eager to read on. It was interesting to know the dynamics of someone who  would enter this type of work. They are the bravest and smartest men that  has ever been known to man. You can identify with their families and feel compassion to the wives who have to let them go withhout any details. The life they lead is for the country,and only the U.S. citizens and their families. I could not put this book down. I have reccommened it to everyon I talk to.
B006ZDU7QI|2.0|This album jumps all over the place in terms of tone. There are several good songs on it, but they do not go together.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|looking forward to see how they turn this into a movie as it will be interesting to see how they turn a book of letters into the story.
0385333846|4.0|This is the first Vonnegut novel I've read so I didn't know what to expect. Strange book but I'll say this--I read it in one sitting because it's so odd, it kept me curious to see what the author would do next. My main reading diet is thrillers and nonfiction--not much literary fiction. Slaughterhouse Five is an odd combo of literary fiction and sci-fi.<br /><br />Overall: fascinating; intriguing; keeps you thinking for a while after reading. On the other hand, this book has a consciously inflated sense of self-importance and a vague atmosphere of misogyny. It's billed as a compelling anti-war novel. Well, it is anti-war, I suppose, but the protagonist is so pathetic that his failure as a soldier seems to reflect his failure in life as a whole. If you want an anti-war novel, try [[ASIN:0449911497 All Quiet on the Western Front]].
B008B9JSD2|4.0|This unusual and sad tale does a really nice job of recreating the pomp and circumstance of Vatican rituals and politics.  There is a strong farcical element, however, that takes up too much viewing time and detracts from the seriousness of the story--namely a wacky psychoanalyst organizing a volleyball tournament for the Cardinals.  Otherwise, this film is pretty unique and provides some useful philosophical food for thought.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Delightful. Have enjoyed Firefly and only recently realized that Setenity is a movie rather than an episode. Imaginative, good moral, a thriller.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|Such a fun game.  Who thought growing & eating bamboo could be so entertaining?  Great storage for pieces in box.  Amazing replay value.  Very cute for all ages & genders.  Highly recommended.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like all the stuff I have seen so far.  My only hang up is when post don't go to a link.  It would be good to have a glitches button or something to let IT people know.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Buy it, read it, love it! The writing is artful and poetic, yet the story is fast-paced and engaging. I can't imagine any fan of fantasy being disappointed.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|IS A HAPPY BOOK AND VERY EASY TO READ.<br />THE CHARACTERS ARE REALLY HUMAN AND RELATABLE, NOT THAT I HAVE MENTAL PROBLEMS, BUT I GUESS IN SOME MEASURE WE ALL WANT TO BELIEVE OUR LIFE IS A MOVIE WITH A HAPPY ENDING.<br />I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is not the standard good guy/bad guy mystery. I didn't find any of the characters sympathetic, which made the whole read all the more fun. The ending was a bit of a letdown, but not enough to make the book a disappointment. I would strongly recommend it to anyone tired of feeling they read the same plot over and over.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Goof for knowing what a word means and other stuff and cool other stuff or good other stuff like that
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Blood, gore, weaponry, magic, great adventure, coming of age. The books are full of action and humor. I strongly recommend the series to anyone looking for a wild ride; however, I probably wouldn't recommend them for someone with a sensitive stomach.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|id never ever wear a sons of anarchy shirt.<br />ever.<br />i will admit i watch the show though.<br />its good. and buying it on amazon a season at a time beats one episode a week for me.<br />i like to watch them when i can, or if the weathers crappy and i just wanna chill ill watch a couple at a time on saturday or sunday morning.<br />if you like it.  buy it.<br />.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Lots of fun and addicting. Cute concept. Don't have pay for anything. Reminds of the original I played as a kid.

B009HSVHV2|4.0|I picked this up at an independent record store 2 days early and have listened to it almost non stop since then. The real key to Monster is the album stays solid as it goes along and doesn't lose steam like Sonic Boom, another key is lyrically it's just better than SB. Monster just feels more mature. The production is simply top notch, Paul Stanley did a great job there and as a Gene fan I couldn't be happier! In short, everything that was good about Sonic Boom is simply better on Monster, the songs just gel together better with very little filler.<br /><br />1.) Hell Or Hallelujah (PAUL) - 5/5 a great lead off track, is it 1977 again? Is gas still $0.62 a gallon? **COMPLETELY** written by Paul is a plus! Not Paul \\"and friends\\"!<br /><br />2.) Wall Of Sound (GENE) - 5/5 an awesome Gene song, so much power and conviction, he really sells this song!<br /><br />3.) Freak (PAUL) - 3.75/5 one of the more catchy songs in melody but the word \\"Freak\\" seems out of place.<br /><br />4.) Back To The Stone Age (GENE) - 4/5 a clever metaphor for going back to what made Kiss \\"KISS\\". Great guitar solo. I LIKE IT!<br /><br />5.) Shout Mercy (PAUL) - 3.5/5 solid, could be considered filler. Still better than many of the similar songs on Sonic Boom and Psycho Circus<br /><br />6.) Long Way Down (PAUL) - 4.5/5 lyrically it's the best song on the album, damn catchy too, nice groove and melody line.<br /><br />7.) Eat Your Heart Out (GENE) - 3.5/5 once I edited out the vocal opening I liked the song more, still don't care for the chorus, again with \\"the backbone slip\\" lyric?<br /><br />8.) The Devil Is Me (GENE) - 5/5 almost a sister song to Wall of Sound, Unholy meets Destroyer, absolutely crushing!! Again, the lyrics SAY SOMETHING unlike \\"Hot and Cold\\" and other Sonic Boom songs. I don't even think a high schooler would write something as insipid as \\"Hot and Cold\\".<br /><br />9.) Outta This World (TOMMY) - 4/5 better than his song on Sonic Boom, still don't care for the persona taking. If nothing else, it's too bad Ace couldn't have ducked in and played and sang this one track!<br /><br />10.) All For The Love Of R&R (ERIC) - 3.75/5 another song written exclusively by Paul, I liked Erics \\"All for the Glory\\" more on SB but this one gets the job done, wished Peter could have sang this. Also, the song needs to be a little faster.<br /><br />11.) Take Me Down Below (G&P) - 4/5 damn clever. love these lyrics and the pseudo story telling!<br /><br />12.) Last Chance (PAUL) - 3/5 fair closer but this one really is filler.<br /><br />I know the war will never truly end over the persona taking, but Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer need to be given credit for helping create another page of Kisstory, and while they can't take the place of Ace and Peter they do a good job of holding the reigns.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This DVD was AMAZAYN, BRILLIAM, EXTRAORDINHARRY, PHENOMENIALL, & FABULOUIS! This is highly recommended by a trustworthy one directioner!!! ;) xx
B005LAIHY0|3.0|Let's get this straight: PROMETHEUS is a polarizing film for many reasons.  I personally have yet to truly make up my mind about it.  Do I think it's an epically-drawn sci-fi piece, or an ego-driven effort into heady ideas and special effects?  I can't tell you.  Probably because, truthfully, it's both.<br /><br />The plot begins simply enough: a pair of scientists discover ancient cave drawings that they feel point toward a distant planet.  This planet may or may not hold the secret to life on Earth.  The scientists gain funding, a crew, and a spaceship, and head toward said planet.  Bad things happen when they get there.  Very bad things.<br /><br />There's a lot of good to be said in PROMETHEUS's favor.  The acting is solid; mainstays Charlize Theron, Noomie Rapace, Guy Pearce, and Logan Marshall-Green deliver solid, if not altogether memorable, performances.  Idris Elba is a standout in his supporting role.  Undoubtedly the best thing to be said about the film, everything else aside, is Michael Fassbender's performance as the LAWRENCE OF ARABIA-loving android David.  Fassbender has Peter O'Toole down pat, quoting him left and right in a near-perfect imitation, while keeping his character ambiguous and vaguely threatening (think Lance Henriksen's Bishop, but British).  Fassbender possibly deserves an Oscar nom for this one...but then, he usually does.<br /><br />Other good things: cinematography, special effects, overall ideology.  This film was a labor of love, and it truly shows.  There are some shocking scenes; there are some funny scenes; there are some touching and haunting scenes.  Bad thing: these scenes don't necessarily congeal.  Or maybe they do.  It depends if you buy into the overall goal of the movie, the point that it either makes or doesn't make (depending on how close attention you pay to details and plot holes).  The script is decidedly lackluster; it's bland and cliched, especially in dialogue.  Where the film excels is ideas.  The question is whether those ideas are carried out effectively.<br /><br />MILD SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW (though I give nothing away that I didn't know going into the film; if you are overly cautious, skip to the final paragraph).<br /><br />Here's the thing: PROMETHEUS tries to do too much.  It's a sci-fi adventure film; it's a borderline-theology piece; it's needlessly a part of the ALIEN universe (as though director Ridley Scott forced his writers to add that in there); it's a commentary on the human desire to know everything, and the consequences that come with such knowledge.  It is all of these things separately; it is rarely all of these things together.  There are many great ideas buried at the core of PROMETHEUS; Scott and company mine deep enough to give us a glimpse of most of these, but rarely go far enough to fully dig them out of the ground.<br /><br />Ultimately, whether you enjoy PROMETHEUS is based on your ability to suspend disbelief, open your mind, and marvel in what is otherwise a solid B-movie with A-list special effects and talent behind it.  If you can't do that, don't fret--PROMETHEUS doesn't work hard to make you to believe.  Instead, it bombards you with ideas.  It's supposedly the first of three films, so hopefully the second entry will settle all of the unanswered questions, and perhaps explain many of the plot holes.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed every episode! I especially like how the writers worked on time relevant historical facts and events from around the world. The writers magically intertwined these events and how they impacted all forms of society. The actors captivate you and Maggie Smith is fantastic? Brilliantly done!

B008JFC6F0|5.0|Tame Impala's previous album, 2010's superb 'Innerspeaker--as original and forward-thinking as it was compared to most modern psychedelic albums--was very reminiscent of '66-'67-era Beatles, if the Beatles of that time had time-traveled to the present and listened to massive amounts of Dungen's Swedish space-rock before recording their next album, making use of modern studio wizardry. But, while Kevin Parker's voice still sounds a lot like Lennon's (and probably always will), 'Lonerism' is a giant step forward in the evolution of their sound, seemingly influenced as much by the mid-70's, electronic-based interstellar sounds of bands like Tangerine Dream and Italy's Sensations' Fix as the Beatles this time around, while at the same time sounding utterly fresh and unique.<br /><br />Of course, Parker's ear for infectious pop melodies still recalls Lennon and McCartney circa 'Revolver,' as do most melody-centric psych bands worth their weight in salt. But 'Lonerism' features synthesizers playing as integral of a role as the walls of fuzzed-out guitars, and this adds a whole new dimension to their sound (or maybe I should say \\"his\\" sound, as Parker once again handles all songwriting, instrumental, and vocal duties). The spaces between riffs are taken advantage of as well, with ethereal atmospherics and intertwining melodies filling those gaps, and when combined with the virtual myriad of musical styles and influences contained within, results in one of the most ambitious, absorbing--at times even blissful--albums I've heard in recent memory.<br /><br />The tripped-out, early-Floyd vibe of \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" is the perfect evidence of this bliss, when--after a dreamy, chugging 3-minute buildup which abruptly cuts off into silence for a brief moment--a euphoric symphony of sounds erupts from the speakers, sending this listener off into deep innerspace, a journey I didn't come back from for a good 45 minutes, when the last notes of the album unfortunately faded. The melancholy \\"Why Won't They Talk to Me?\\" is another example, with Parker's multi-tracked, reverb-laden voice harmonizing with itself over an infectious, bouncing drumbeat and swirling synth and organ sounds, resulting in one of the most hypnotic headphone trips you're likely to ever hear. His lyrics here, and throughout the album, are despair-filled yet hopeful, matching the overall musical vibe of 'Lonerism.'<br /><br />While most albums released these days are front-loaded with the best tracks (now that I think about it, this is nothing new), this album really hits it's groove in the second half, imo. \\"Feels like We Only Go Backwards\\"--while upon first blush seems like a low-key, middle-of-the-road dreamy ballad--was totally embedded in my brain last night while I was trying to sleep, with it's insanely catchy and melodic chorus repeating itself over and over until I finally had to get up and listen to it, resulting in my listening to the entire album yet again. Which in turn resulted in my writing this review at dawn in a somewhat manic state, and on less than an hour of sleep.<br /><br />The centerpiece of the album for me, however, is without question the near-epic penultimate track, \\"Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control.\\" It's probably the one most undoubtedly Beatles-y song on the album, and yet it's one of the most original, progressive, and just-plain-mindblowing tracks in modern psych, blazing it's own trail while using mid-late period Beatles as a launching pad. It's a masterpiece of obsessive production, with melodies snaking around melodies, weaving in and around the main hook to the point that it's nearly impossible to absorb it all on the first--or even second or third--listen. This song more than any other requires headphones for maximum effect, and is the perfect climax to a nearly-perfect album, with the whimsical, piano-laden \\"Sun's Coming Up\\" serving as the perfect coda.<br /><br />'Lonerism' is about as close to flawlessas there is in modern rock music, imo, and should be a sure-fire contender for album of the year with most hard-core music aficionados, much like 'Innerspeaker' was two years ago. Though, unbelievably, this makes that album seem like a mere warm-up--an early, black and white predecessor to this high-definition, 3-D masterpiece. I have no idea where Kevin Parker (and co.) will go from here, but I can now guarantee you that I'll follow, no matter where the road takes him. Right now it's hard for me to imagine him topping this anytime soon, but after witnessing the creative leap made with 'Lonerism,' it certainly wouldn't surprise me.
0345803507|5.0|Loved this trilogy! The best sequal type books I  have ever read.When you finish the first you cant wait to read the 2nd one. Thought they were very well written. Will  be looking for other books from this author! Wow! Changes your way of thinking without making you judgemental....
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I love Gillian Flynn's novels.  They suck you in and they are near impossible to put down.  I found myself making excuses or going to bed early so I could sneak off and read her books.  Nevertheless, I felt like the ending of this book, like Gone Girl and Dark Places, left a lot to be desired.  Flynn's stories are so good and descriptive, they are worth reading anyway.  I hope that she gets more assistance or imput next time on how to conclude her story in a satisfactory way.  Call me next time, Gillian, we will brainstorm!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first heard of this book, I wasn't interested because I thought it was a kids book.  Then a friend told me she loved the series, and so I bought the first book.  I could not put it down!  I immediately rented the movie after reading the book (a habit of mine), then bought the second book.  I'm almost done with that, and will, without a doubt, buy the third when I'm finished.<br /><br />I would recommend this book highly!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've finished over half of the game and been loving it! There's some tough levels that require a brain and thinking outside the box, those are my favorite levels. Definitely worth the money!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I read the book and then saw the movie. If I hadn't read the book I would have been lost about all the drama that's supposed to be going on. The movie is ok by itself, it just misses so much detail that the book provided that I was disappointed with it. I think that they should have taken book one and made two movies. That way they wouldn't have had to leave most of the plot, and great acting, on the cutting room floor. Two movies, each at least two hours long, would have helped the actors to put the plot together. There was just too much missing from the movie that you need to understand what's going on at a personal level. Hope they do better with the next ones.
B004R6JG7G|4.0|Average movie, but really cool in bluray, great to see the non crazy tom cruise.... Kelly mcgillis looked grrrrrreat...special effects still hold up all these years later
B008GFI418|5.0|I admit to having held tremendous respect for Sir George Martin for decades.  I feel he is a creative genius on par with some of the great fine artists of our time.  His body of work is so immense that no film could touch on all of it.  Back in the mid-1980's, Bruce Steele produced a 13 hour series for CBC Radio titled \\"Through the Ears of George Martin\\" that chronicled Martin's work up to that time.  It would be fascinating to hear that again and explore the ensuing decades since that was produced.<br /><br />Even though so much of his work could not be included, this film provides an enjoyable glimpse of his past from a current perspective. It was wonderful to see him still vital today. 40+ minutes of bonus material added more insights into this great man.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was hesitant to purchase this book after reading all the nasty remarks.  But after reading most of the recent reviews, I decided they didn't match the ratings, so I went forward with reading it.  I'm not sure what people were expecting but the book was good.  It had a few unexpected twists and was a quick read.<br /><br />On the down side, there were a few grammar and spelling errors and some missing words.  But as far as the context of the story goes, it is an enjoyable book.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Earth's Mightiest Heroes unite in the crowd-pleasing superhero blockbuster The Avengers. The rogue asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has stolen the Tessaract cube and plans to use its limitless power to launch a massive invasion upon the world and subjugate all mankind. In response to this imminent threat, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., reactivates the Avenger Initiative that brings together Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers / Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Bruce Banner / the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). The Avengers is a rousing action-packed summer movie that lives up to its tremendous hype. Director Joss Whedon (Serenity) manages to create a well-structured thrill ride with enough fanboy enthusiasm to make it one of the most entertaining comic book movies to ever hit the big screen. The Avengers delivers some spectacular visual effects and great action scenes that culminates to a thrilling battle sequence on and above the streets of New York City. The all-star cast also includes Scarlett Johanson, Jeremy Renner, Clark Gregg, Cobbie Smulders and Stellan Skarsgard.<br /><br />If you were worried that the Blu-Ray release of The Avengers wouldn't live up to your expectation, the you'll be pleased that this is a must-have for your Blu-Ray collection. The superhero blockbuster is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen format. The HD transfer is wonderfully detailed and sharp, and its DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 delivers an astounding home theater experience. Its special features includes an audio commentary by director Joss Whedon, the video short \\"Item 47\\", a 4-minute gag reel, 15 minutes of deleted end extended scenes, 2 behind-the-scene featurettes (A Visual Journey & Assembling the Ultimate Team) and the Soundgarden Music Video \\"Live to Rise\\". Overall, The Avengers scores a highly recommended \\"A\\".
B004EBUXI0|4.0|This is a fantastic CPU, and if you read any technical reviews, they all agree. Intel really is king right now, and this CPU is a great choice.    That said, unless you are really penny-pinching, you should really look at the i5-3550, which when I bought it was only $15 more, and has an improved architecture (thus speeding up your processing): [...]    Edit: Apparently, now the i5-3550 is even cheaper than the i5-2500, which makes no sense to me. I have no idea why you would buy this CPU over the 3550, especially since the 3550 is cheaper!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, couldn't put the book down, finished it in 3 days. it was a very enticing story just wish it ended with the two meeting up again.(Dawson and Amanda)
0525423842|4.0|Because I've read (and own, in hardcover) everything written by John Grisham, I couldn't resist picking this up, even though it's geared towards kids. I actually really enjoyed it! Yes, the language is simplified to appeal to its target audience, but I really appreciated the \\"law for dummies\\" explanations that he offers. I learned so much about trials, courtroom etiquette, and the law, in general, just from reading this book! Young readers will appreciate the references to modern tween life (although I did notice the absence of iPods and MP3 players) and the lighthearted manner in which the book is written. They might also decide that they wish to pursue a career in law!<br /><br />My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is, sometimes the vernacular was not exactly \\"kid.\\" For example, sometimes Theo refers to his mom as \\"Mother\\" instead of \\"Mom.\\" There were just a scant few examples of this (which took me, as the reader, out of \\"kid mode\\") but I really did enjoy the story, overall, and I look forward to reading more adventures of Theo Boone.
0547564651|5.0|How Children Succeed by Paul Tough will force you to think about pressure we put on teachers to educate in the classroom when a host of determinate factors outside of the classroom may be more apt to tell whether a child \\"succeeds.\\"<br /><br />In what I can only describe as a Gladwellian analysis of characteristics of successful children, Tough goes far beyond the classroom and uncovers the necessity of harder to measure factors such as \\"Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character.\\"<br /><br />This book presents a necessary perspective to understand how we must change our approach from simply the education of a child, to a more holistic approach of \\"child development\\" that creates intuitive pathways to develop things like care, character, drive, and determination even in the midst of often bleak economic and social circumstances.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B007SSDS24|3.0|Movie was too slow ( action )for my liking. The ending was not fulfilling, did not show what happened to the bad guys, if they were to return.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|This is my all tin e favorite movie. When I am having a bad day I put in peter pan and watch it sometimes once, sometimes more than once, until I feel better. Some how it takes all the bad and helps me find the good, or the lessons, in my otherwise negative day. It reminds me to push through any stumbling block, and keep my head held high. No remake does  that, just this one. I lost the disc somehow in my last move so repurchased, and it looked like it had never been used before.

B008PC1GF8|5.0|Version of 1890: ed. Haas<br />Recorded in the Great Hall of the Vienna Musikverein, November, 1988 (CD first release: 1989)<br />Executive Producer: G&uuml;nther Breest; Producer: Michael Glotz; Balance Engineer: G&uuml;nther Hermanns<br /><br />This recording of Bruckner's 8th Symphony has been considered *hors concours* since its initial release as a 2-CD set back in 1989. It has remained in the catalog as a full-price set until recently, deleted only to make way for this reissue in DG's Originals series.<br /><br />This time around, the entire symphony is contained on a single CD, which times out at 82'58\\". It has been processed through DG's \\"Original Image Bit Processing\\" techniques. Knowing that some older CD players have problems tracking extended-length CDs, I played the end minutes of the disc on my older Technics CD deck - it had no problem tracking the extended play length.<br /><br />I then gave the entire disc a straight-through listen, following along with my Breitkopf & H&auml;rtel study score of the Haas version (later references to the score in this review refer to the B&H study score). I then went back and did a few A-B comparisons of the new Originals issue to the 2-CD set that was released in 1989.<br /><br />Here's the review:<br /><br />Overall, it sounds like the engineers have opted for a less-close perspective than they did in 1989. There's a good deal more air around the sound than there was in 89, more like you're a few rows back in the orchestra section of the hall, rather than being on the podium. I think this is an improvement in many respects. The violins and trumpets gain enormously - their timbres are much more natural this time around. The horns and oboes, however, seemed to have less presence than before. In fact, they are a bit recessed in the sound stage compared to 1989. The bass line has been brought into better focus. Perhaps tighter focus is more descriptive. This has the advantage of firming up the bass line throughout the recording, but it's at the expense of a certain haziness that added a sense of warmth to the recording in 1989.<br /><br />I would say that compared to 1989, the new Originals version presents a more-analytical sound stage. This is great for hearing inner voices in the strings and winds, but the clarity coupled with the \\"seat in the hall perspective\\" compromises some of the mystery and timelessness that this recording has always evoked for me. As a musician, I think that's a plus in most respects. Others may disagree.<br /><br />Comparing the two issues, I can now detect some subtle and not-so-subtle knob twisting and tweaking that was done in 1989. For instance, one bar before rehearsal \\"S\\" (bar 330) in the first movement, the 2nd fiddles and violas have a little interchange that stands out in the 1989 version. It comes as one of those points where K stops to smell the roses, as it were, and that comes off as a nuanced highlight to the listener. In the new Originals version, the notes are there, but the moment passes without that little goose it had in 1989.  One could miss it if one wasn't keyed into the small notes under the big phrases. I think the engineering in 1989 better set up the new phrase that begins at letter \\"S\\".<br /><br />Many of Karajan's recordings feature intense string playing that often pushes the envelope, testing the seams of the sound of a recording, as it were. This is especially true in the 3rd and 4th movements of the Bruckner 8th. But that doesn't happen in the Originals version, where these string licks are handily accommodated by the more-open sound stage. The effect is of an orchestra playing with a fulsome sound, but without that nth degree of intensity that sends it over the top. It sounds more like the way a real orchestra sounds in the hall, but it has me wondering if that's what K actually wanted in this *recording.* That intense, hard-to-contain sound on the 1989 version has a certain drama to it that isn't there in the new version.<br /><br />I mentioned that the bass line is now firmer and more focused. It's a narrower sound than the 1989 version. This does clarify the pitch in the double basses and celli. The timpani sounds more like the sound K drew from his Berlin player than what I'm used to from Vienna, which is to say the sound is tighter and cleaner. It's a bit startling to put the new version up against the 1989 version in this respect.<br /><br />It sounds to me as if this time around, the engineers decided on a general perspective and a philosophy that said to leave well enough alone, setting certain technical parameters for the remaster and letting the chips fall where they may when it comes to balances and nuances that were (to my ears) given a little \\"help\\" back in 1989. If so, that was a wise choice, in that the recording now sounds more natural. The question is, does it sound so natural as to sound commonplace? Is it really what Karajan wanted to leave as a legacy? Or is it not what he wanted, but a more-faithful representation of what was set down in the studio (and by \\"studio,\\" I mean that this recording appears to be based on live performances with a few touch up sessions sans audience at a later date)? The truth is that some of the \\"mystery\\" that has attached itself to K's music making and this recording in particular has been jettisoned to make way for a more analytical perspective that may or may not be to everyone's liking.<br /><br />I've always felt that the sound in the Finale of this recording got a bit congested in 1989. No chance of that here in Originals land, what with the added air and the more-distant perspective. The trumpets absolutely peal forth with a wide-open sound in the finale that is extremely convincing and exciting. There is plenty of \\"head room\\" to accommodate the sound of the brass in this remastering. I first noticed this in the second movement, which in 1989 had the trumpets (and horns) sort of off in their own perspective. Here, they are integrated into the picture while soaring above the band when needed. In fact, the recording is now balanced to sound the way one would expect to hear it in a concert hall, which is to say that oboes, clarinets and horns are sometimes going to get swamped in orchestral tuttis.<br /><br />Also, the brass have now been placed to sound across the perspective of the sound stage, which is a big improvement over the 1989 issue, where their sound seemed to be localized in the left channel of the stereo picture.<br /><br />I'd say the new Originals version is a good recommendation for those who don't already own this recording. However, the 1989 version has more mystery, and perhaps more closely represents what Karajan wished to leave to posterity (the recording was issued after his death in 1989...hard to know how much direct impact he had on the final mix).<br /><br />If nothing else, this issue raises an interesting question about choices that Karajan made about the mix of his recordings when he was alive. I don't know how much of the differences in the Originals version can be put down to advance in technologies or the choices of the engineers who didn't have K standing over them as they went about their business this time around, but I find myself liking the choices they have made, if for no other reason than the fact that the orchestra just sounds more like a real orchestra than it did in 1989. For some, that may translate as being more earthbound in the new Originals version.<br /><br />In any case, worth a listen, and even a purchase. At midprice (ie: less than half the price of the 2-CD version), it's sort of a no-brainer.<br /><br />I would add that at this point it would hardly seem worth the time and effort (and cost) to track down the 2-CD version. Overall, this reissue beats that version hands down, IMHO./>I mentioned that the bass line is now firmer and more focused. It's a narrower sound than the 1989 version.

B007THA4FI|2.0|As with all of Ms. Rowling's books, I pre-ordered and waited in anticipation for \\"delivery\\" day.  While her HP books were intended for a younger audience, I was enthralled by her writing style, character development and creative plots.  I couldn't wait to read her \\"adult\\" book and share it with my 81-year-old mother.<br /><br />Sadly, I feel that I've been \\"taken\\".  If written by any other author, this book would have been panned.  While I appreciate the fact that Ms. Rowling is enlightening her readers on a subject that is dear to her, the book lacks all of the qualities that made her so popular in the first place.
B009G8GRX6|1.0|I thought \\"Resistance\\" was their best album to date for me personally, because it had three things that really appeal to me 1)Queen influences 2)Metal influences 3)managed to be completely unique while combining influences, and let me throw one more important thing in there, it was COHESIVE. This new album just sounds like a hodgepodge of experimental nonsense, lacking in hooky choruses and anthemic melodies,it lacks the cohesion of it's predecessor musically and lyrically, don't get me wrong there are still flashes of brilliance and hints of the old Muse in there, they are just bogged down by experimentation with Dubstep, electronica, and overall boring songwriting.<br />This album is definitely a letdown and a misfire for Muse , who could have been on a roll after the well recieved \\"Resistance\\", the shame is now we will have to wait years to see if they can redeem themselves with the follow-up.
B006PTL1QM|1.0|I expected more from this movie.  I'd love to see interplay between Dr.Freud and Dr. Jung, but I was disappointed.  I put Dr. Jung on a pedestal as a model of spirituality because of his devotion to helping the first alcoholics receive information about their illness.  Dr. Jung is quoted in the Big Book of Alcoholic Anonymous -- the medical knowledge.  Dr. Freud - well he abused cocaine probably distorted his view of spirituality.  I would like to see something between these two great men again in the future.

1878424319|1.0|I did not enjoy the book.  It was a struggle to stay focused on the words.  I thought there was too much intellectualization to hold my interest
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I LOVE this movie. My typical norm for recreational movie viewing is mystery/suspense, but this movie was wonderful. It made me feel a part of the show...I felt, upon leaving, that I had actually visited India. The filming was rich and colorful... I could almost smell the smells etc. Loved it. I laughed, I cried, and I related to the age group. Judi Dench, as usual was amazing, as was Maggie Smith, but all the actors were excellent. Great pic. I heartily recommend!
B009329Y30|5.0|I thought this movie was great!  Zac is awesome!  Love the romance and the movie's plot.  I had to purchase the dvd so I could watch it again and again!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a great game. Can't wait for the next one. if you like hidden object games this is for you
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book, and I even loved the ending which many seem to criticize. It is fascinating to me when an author can tell a good story and weave so many other elements into the book.  It is so rich especially if viewed through multiple lenses.  The way the book is written you are tossed around mentally and psychologically so that you almost feel psychotic yourself.  The end was clever, completely fulfilling well maybe not, but I don't think the author intended it that way.  The reader feels the same uneasiness and angst as the characters.  Did you really want an Amazing Amy ending...and if so does that make you any better then Amy's parents?  Just a thought....
B000W91RUG|5.0|My entire family, loves this show. We are collecting all the seasons, of course I had to start with Season 1. Will also be buying them to ship to my son who is in the Air Force. He loves this show.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app...I actually prefer using Pinterest via the app vs on my PC.  I have been having issues since installing the most recent update...I always get a &quot;force close&quot; message on my first try opening P, but other than that it is wonderful and so convenient.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not sure how I stumbled upon this book, because I'm not into gaming or science fiction. I'm only 68% done with the book, but it's great so far. It references a lot of geek culture (some of which I remember from my childhood) in a nostalgic way and while being an action-oriented book, it also comments on the appeal and struggle of escaping into an alternate reality. I am thoroughly enjoying this from many different angles and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fiction. It also helps if you're a bit nostalgic for the 80s and 90s.
