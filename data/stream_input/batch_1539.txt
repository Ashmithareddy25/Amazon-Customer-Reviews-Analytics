B001UV4XWY|5.0|The Box is like Alfred Hitchcock in The Twilight Zone. If you don't like that sort of thing, chances are you won't like this movie as it takes a dark step into the strange world of Sci-Fi. I get why people dislike it, but I did like it because it's so mysterious and psychologically messed up.<br /><br />The box has a button that when pushed, brings consequences. If you don't concern yourself when the consequences only affect others what will become of you when consequences come knocking at your door?
0547569653|3.0|Eat and Run: My Unlikely Journey to Ultramarathon Greatness by Scott Jurek and Steve Friedman is the second book I've read now on the sport of ultrarunning--that is running races of 50 to more than 100 miles in length.  Born to Run was the first book I read on the subject and the better written of the two, but both books are good enough to make me want to give running a try.<br /><br />Scott Jurek was profiled in Born to Run and Eat and Run is his story, how he went from being a scrawny kid suffering from the heartache of a father's neglect and his mother's battle with multiple sclerosis, to running the Badwater Marathon, a 135 mile race through Death Valley.<br /><br />Jurek also chronicles how he went from being a frequent visitor of McDonald's to a vegan, forsaking all meat products, including dairy.  His book is filled with recipes and though I may feel slightly inspired to run, and while I might feel inclined to give up meat, I still feel no inclination to start cooking.  But I do believe that Jurek's commitment to what he put in his body greatly contributed to his success and health.<br /><br />I have a friend who runs ultramarathons and I'm still not sure how people do it.  Jurek comments on the number of former addicts who race ultramarathons and admits there is a certain addictive quality to it.  Science has documented the release of endorphins that occurs when we exercise and those endorphins can fill us with pleasure.  That being said, Jurek fights his own battle with depression.  A friend and fellow runner commits suicide and Jurek finds the sport so isolating that for a time, he loses his best friend.<br /><br />So why run?<br /><br />Jurek writes:  \\"You can be transformed.  Not overnight, but over time.  Life is not a race.  Neither is an ultramarathon ... there is no finish line.  We strive toward a goal, and whether we achieve it or not is important, but it's not what's most important.  What matters is how we move toward that goal.  What's crucial isthe step we're taking now, the step you're taking now.\\"<br /><br />Running then becomes a metaphor for how we move through life.<br /><br />And perhaps the most important thing to take from this book is not that we should all start running, but that we should all look at our lives, take a hard look at our goals and see how we are moving to them.  And then when things seem darkest, when we think we can't take another step, push ourselves forward anyway.  Though Jurek ran alone, through almost every race, he had a crew, someone to support him either as a pacer or food and water supplier, someone there to just shout encouragement.

B003UESJH4|4.0|I didn't know before the release of this film that Queen Elizabeth's father had a speech impairment. It's easy to just presume that certain individuals have it all together when in reality, they have problems too. The King's Speech is an inspiring and well done film that brings a slice of not-so-distant history into the cinema. The cast is wonderful, always love Geoffrey Rush!<br /><br />At the start, Prince Albert wasn't next in line to become the king and had a stuttering problem to boot. Rather unexpectedly, his older brother abdicates the throne to marry a divorced woman named Wallis and he finds himself in the uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing position of having to make an important speech over the radio wire. His wife introduces him to a speech therapist who can turn things around for her royal husband.

B002I9Z89Y|4.0|Fans of TOS rejoice!  This long-time trekker is mostly satisfied as we get both the original and the \\"souped-up\\" versions here and for me the new versions are very, very good indeed.  Both the picture and sound qualities have improved immensely and here in season 2 we have the best season of TOS as best as it can be; finally, definitive versions of my favourite ever tv series!  Even the packaging is satisfying as it doesn't take up nearly as much shelf space as any of the other previous releases; in the size of 2 of the usual one disc blu ray we get the entire second season in 7 discs. Many of the greatest and my favourite TOS episodes are here like: \\"Amok Time\\", \\"Metamorphosis\\", \\"Journey To Babel\\", \\"Friday's Child\\", \\"Wolf In the Fold\\", \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\", \\"A Piece of the Action\\", and \\"The Ultimate Computer\\".  The reason for the 4 stars though is the one major irritant here in \\"The Trouble With Tribbles\\" episode which sadly involves one of the definitive TOS episodes.  If this happened in one of the minor episodes perhaps I wouldn't care but there is a major line in this episode which never failed to make me chuckle when Kirk turns around and orders Scotty to go on shore leave and he says \\"enjoy yourself; that's an order!\\"  For some reason, this line is removed as the scene quickly dissolves into the next scene; this is criminal!  Why couldn't this happen to one of the dud episodes like \\"I, Mudd\\" or \\"The Omega Glory\\" instead of the iconic \\"The Trouble With Tribbles?\\"  Otherwise, this blu-ray version of season 2 is by far the definitive version that is currently out there.<br /><br />Except for the Tribbles mistake very highly recommended!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great mystery that kept me reading late into the night . . . not a \\"black and white\\" scenario, but one told with honesty and real emotions from a parent's perspective of a troubled child. A deputy district attorney assigned to a teen's mysterious death finds himself questioning his own son's involvement.  The ever-deepening investigation reveals a life and possible genetic link to violence that is still controversial in today's society.  Narrator can be trying at times, but the denial parents often use with their offsprings' faults is realistically pictured in the book. Reminiscent of Turow's Presumed Innocent in parts, but not as beautifully written.
B002I9Z8G2|5.0|I have to own up up front that my favourite Star Trek series is TOS and while I did enjoy DS3 and the later seasons of Voyager a great deal somehow TNG didn't really do much for me.  Let's just say I'm much more excited about DS3 and Voyager coming in Blu-Ray than I am about TNG doing so.  With that out of the way, I have to say that I enjoyed this movie a lot and after Star Trek 6 this is now my favourite Star Trek movie.  I truly hope that the recent alternate universe version of Star Trek finds a new younger audience but the really bad science throughout i.e. the manufactured black hole made me totally disinterested in that movie early on and so if I had to choose just three Star Trek movies to take with me to a desert island they would be \\"The Undiscovered Country - Thearetical Release\\", \\"First Contact\\" and \\"Star Trek 1 - The Movie - Director's Cut\\".<br /><br />Regarding \\"First Contact\\", it looks great in 1080p and sounds good in Dolby TrueHD although I personally would have preferred a DTS-HD MA option.  Unlike too many other blu-ray releases, the BD-Live here is actually more than just a trailer of other movies to sell vehicle and I enjoyed the Star Trek IQ interactive quiz.  As for the content, we get a nice mixture of adventure and excitement as well as an homage to one of my favourite TOS episodes \\"Metamorphosis\\" where Cochrane is first introduced and a little drama with Picard which echoes another TOS episode \\"Obsession\\" as well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great Star Trek movie irrespective of series and both the picture and sound qualities are vastly improved over the standard dvd versions.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B00400NHRO|4.0|This book was published in 1978 and describes internship at a Harvard hospital in the early 70s.<br />I was an intern at the Mass. General Hosp. 1959-60 and a surgical resident there from 60-64 (MBH in the book.)<br />The book describes a medical internship at Beth Israel Hospital (\\"House of God\\") which was also a Harvard hospital, affiliated with Harvard Medical School (BMS in the book.)<br />Although circumstances of each hospital and each intern obviously vary, this book gives one an accurate \\"feel\\" of what internship was like in the 70s (and 60s.)<br />The situations and dialogue may be shocking to the lay reader, but are quite representative of the era, and probably many aspects of current internship. Some of the situations are \\"inside\\" pictures that may be more meaningful to MDs, but should be of interest and readable by laymen. I don't know how I missed the book when it came out, but guess I was too busy in training. I enjoyed it recently and recommended it to colleagues who also found the book interesting.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I found the book enlightening. While I grew up during the early part of the book, I was not aware of many of the incidents that are detailed.

0345803485|1.0|Our book club generally reads well-written, thought-provoking works, both fiction and non-fiction. We love gathering together, digging into the book, exploring the characters, and pondering what the author was thinking. None of that will be possible with this one. The writing is trite, repetitive and completely uninteresting, even as a beach book. I struggled to finish, despite the rising \\"conflict\\" and certainly won't be reading the rest of the trilogy - I could care less what happens to Ana and her troubled psyche. Color me fifty shades of bored.

1410415333|1.0|Ferguson didn't come across as a clear or coherent communicator in this book. Maybe for those immersed in the financial sector or economists the writing is fluid. For those with a casual interest, this is not an accessible read. Sorry I didn't research it more before plunging in. The content felt rushed and had non sequitur transitions throughout. Could have been so much better. His editors didn't do him any favors either. A couple of chapters in it becomes clear that the flow is clunky.

1932100660|5.0|I come from the place that if it tastes good I eat it and worry about it later. Later is now and I am willing to listen to the message that more plant food is the desired way to eat. Through the China Study we are shown that healthy nutrition is plant based because it leads to less illness. This book has lots of supporting charts , studies and common sense that builds the case. Prior to reading my reading The China Study, I asked a librarian friend of mine to suggest a book that he thought would be worthwhile reading and he directed me to this book. All he said about the book is I would find it very interesting and not go into all the findings before I read it. I think this will be more life changing than interesting.<br /><br />The question now is what am I fixing for dinner?

When I listened to it for the first time, it sounded a bit noisy, but each time I put it on, it got better and better.  The last song, The Garden, is especially good.  What these three gentlemen continue to produce never ceases to amaze me.  Their musicianship and lyrics are better than ever, but the thing I love the most about Rush is the sincerity that comes out in their music.  There's nothing artsy fartsy about these guys.  They are for real.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|Two months ago I was 357 pounds, miserable, lazy, and depressed. At 35 I finally reached my breaking point and decided that enough was enough. I was going to change my life and get in shape at all cost. After giving up on finding any real help in fitness magazines, I decided to see if there were any books out there that did a better job of offering facts and real advice than the magazines I had encountered.<br /><br />I found this book and have not looked back. The real, honest, straightforward advice offered is top notch! After following the diet and exercise advice in this book I have seen amazing results. I've dropped from 50 waist pants to 44, and have seen amazing gains in strength as well as noticeable muscle definition. I still have a long way to go, but I know that with Michael's help I will reach my goals. I wish I could thank him in person!<br /><br />Being armed with the knowledge provided by this book I have been able to avoid the traps many people fall victim to. I know to ignore \\"broscience\\" and not get fooled into spending hundreds of dollars on unnecessary suppliments because of the honest and real advice Michael offers in this book. I just can't say enough good things about it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While I applaud the masses for raising an erotic novel to the best seller list, I simply can't understand why (other than ultra-savvy marketing) THIS book received such acclaim. It is poorly written, the characters are terribly irritating and the sex scenes aren't all that sexy. I swear, I saw at least 50 copies of Fifty Shades being read while I walked on the beach this morning. Ladies, do yourself a favor and pass this one up.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|After finishing all 5 books of Song of Ice and fire I tried several fantasy books but was always dissapointed. Thougt I never would be able to find and read realy good work in this field. This book was my last attempt as I decided to give up reading fantasy until GRRM's 6th book. However, Blood Song changed everething. May be it is not as deep and the world here is not as big as in ASOIF but still the book is nonetheless interesting and fascinating. What I mostly like here is the plot and that Magic is mixed with very precise dosage. Wish good luck to the author and hope that writing of the second and third books of the trilogy will not last forever.

B005NQ5LQ4|3.0|This is a PREQUEL to the Wilson Yip directed 2-part biography of the Wing Chun wizard Ip Man, which starred Donnie Yen, and was choreographed by Sammo Hung (&#34;The Victim&#34;) and Tony Leung Siu-Hung (&#34;Bloodmoon&#34;).  This film replaces Yen with Dennis To (&#34;Bodyguards and Assassins&#34;) and the director's chair is now filled by Herman Yau (the &#34;Troublesome Night&#34; series).  After sitting out &#34;Ip Man 2&#34;, Tony Leung Siu-Hung  is back, teaming with Checkley Sin Kwok-Lam to stage the fights.  Several of the cast members from the first two films have different roles in this, including Sammo and Fan Siu Wong (&#34;Story of Ricky&#34;).<br /><br />Ip Man is a young teen in the very early 1900s when his father sends him and his adopted brother Tin Chi (Fan Siu Wong) to study Wing Chun with Chan Wah Shun (Hung) in the city of Foshan.  When the Master falls terminally ill, he asks Ng Chung So (Yuen Biao, &#34;Dragons Forever&#34;) to oversee the school.  Man and Tin Chi grow into respectful and dedicated students and Ip Man briefly leaves Foshan for scholastic studies in Hong Kong, where he learns a few amended moves from his deceased master's disgraced former-student Leung Bik (Ip Chan, son of the actual Ip Man).  When he returns to Foshan he'll have to deal with jealousy, love, tenacity and the Japanese.<br /><br />This is not a bad movie at all but much of it registers a little flat.  Dennis To does an okay job as actor but had little experience prior to this film.  I certainly look forward to seeing him in more stuff.  Otherwise silly situations and dialogue marr the film's overall presentation but if you were watching for the fights then you shouldn't be too disappointed.  Plenty of fast exchanges with minimal wirework that's only used to SLIGHTLY exaggerate a move or recovery and for that I say &#34;thank you!&#34;  I must mention that I normally find it excruciating when movies like this show an older gentleman trying to best a young fella but here it actually works.  Ip Chan was at least 85 when this film was made. While you wouldn't expect him to single-handedly clean out a bar filled with sailors, his athleticism is nonetheless impressive.  It was also nice to see Yuen Biao again as his movie appearances seem to occur with decreasing frequency.<br /><br />The history of Wing Chun seems to be a fascinating subject to Sammo Hung as I've seen 5 movies that attempt to depict the art and he has been involved with all of them.  It's assumed that his interest blossomed via his friendship with Bruce Lee, as Mr. Lee was a student of Ip Man. Prior to his work on the &#34;Ip Man&#34; franchise, Hung directed and starred in the non-sequential &#34;Warriors Two&#34; (1978) and &#34;The Prodigal Son&#34; (1981).  &#34;Warriors Two&#34; featured Cassanova Wong as the Cashier (or Banker) Wah, the same character depicted by Sammo in this film.  &#34;The Prodigal Son&#34; featured Yuen Biao as Leung Chang (played in &#34;Warriors Two by Leung Kar Yan), the man who would go on to teach Cashier Wah.  The art before that is a bit of a mystery but it originated from a Shaolin nun who blended the Snake & Crane styles specifically for female student Yim Wing Chun, who went on to marry (and teach) a man whose surname was Leung.<br /><br />The National Arts/Mei Ah/Eleven Arts/Funimation DVD has a very fine widescreen picture with spoken languages available in English or Cantonese.  Subtitles only available in English.  Special features consist of a &#34;making of&#34; segment and some trailers.  This is not a bad film and has better-than-average fights but I'm not sure how heartily I can recommend it.  I think it's arguably better than part 2 but inferior to part 1.

0345495004|4.0|Nice mix of fact and fiction.  Fact to bring out the main characters and the era of expanding views on women's role and modern architecture.  Fiction to drive the story throughout Frank and Mamah's love affair and it's tragic end.  Love in all it's forms is put under the microscope.  This story isn't just about FLW and his mistress, but also the families, the business and the public that loved and lost along with them.
B005FITIDC|4.0|I'd seen the trailers and read press releases for this movie. It didn't prepare me at all for what I was about to experience.<br /><br />Machine Gun Preacher is the story of Sam Childers, fictionalized for a broader audience and appeal. Sam was once an ex-con, drug addict, and all around bad dude.<br /><br />Upon his release from prison, he finds out his wife had become a Christian. Little did he know how upside down his world was about to become.<br /><br />Gerard Butler did a fantastic job playing Sam as he went on his journey. You could see the pain in his eyes, the desire to do good, and the destruction it can sometimes bring.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan was good as the wife of Sam. She portrayed the hurt and despair as she seen her husband slip further and further away as he attempted to help the children of the Sudan.<br /><br />I began watching the movie knowing the background and story. Yet I wasn't expecting the language, yes there is quite a bit of swearing, sexuality, and more in the movie. But that was okay. It setup the story and didn't hold back. If you're not okay with hearing and seeing these types of situations, you may have to pass by this convicting movie.<br /><br />When you watch this movie, I feel you will be changed. You'll see a different side of the world we live in. One where pain and abuse are common place. Few men dare to go there. And yet Sam did.<br /><br />If you're anything like me, you'll find a renewed, or new, desire to step up and do something about the atrocities happening in our world. That's what I feel the movie set out to accomplish and it did.

0688014291|5.0|The One Minute Manager is a narrative about a young man looking for the most effective management skills. Through this parable, Kenneth Blanchard and Spenser Johnson seek to show what makes the most effective management approach, an approach that allows for employee innovation and creativity. The book includes topics on motivating, appraisals and sanctions as well as goal setting.<br /><br />I believe that the advice offered here is very practical and applies to most managerial scenarios. While some may dismiss it as lacking in academic structure, the concepts offered here can help many managers become more effective in motivating and inspiring their employees to creativity and performance. The use of the parable not only simplifies the concepts but also makes you feel less attacked, especially if you are at a managerial position.<br /><br />Whether you are a new manager or you have been in a managerial position for some time, this book has some hidden gems to help in your role. It is imperative to put the advice into practice to see the results. I would recommend this book to anyone who is overseeing others in a managerial capacity.

1577314808|5.0|Motivational and spiritual teacher, Ekhart Tolle offers a simple message in the Power of Now: live in the moment, not in the past or in the future- this is the best way to attain enlightenment, happiness and contentment.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Ekhart. He is clearly a person who understands spirituality a lot and yet is able to break it down into piecemeal so the standard reader can understand. I like his concept of the mind or the ego and the way these can negatively take over your life if you let them. In an overworked world where most people are living for the future or stuck in the past, this book is a refreshing break. I admit that you have to read it at least twice and think about what the author is saying for you to understand the deeper philosophies. Yet it can be summarized into this: the present moment is all there is.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone regardless of his or her spiritual background. If you are looking to settle your mind, to understand how the ego influences your quality of life, this is the book for you. Ekhart does not give you all the answers but he shows you how you can step outside of yourself and assess yourself at the same time.

The musicianship and interplay is superb, allowing Jimi's guitar<br />solos to explore new territories.  For me, the newly introduced song \\"Hey Baby(New Risng Sun)\\"<br />is one of the highlights of this performance... slow, gentle, melodic, pure ecstasy.
1423377001|5.0|I purchased the audio version and enjoyed listening to the book read by the author. I absolutely enjoyed the entire book so much that I checked out his next book titled, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us. I highly recommend this one too.
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg is an insightful book that looks to investigate the factors that motivate us to adopt or let go of certain habits in both our personal and professional life. Using in depth scientific findings and demonstrations, Duhigg reveals the conditions that determine people's habits and influence the success of failure of companies, social movements and raising a family.<br /><br />I think Duhigg did a tremendous job in his scientific research even though this is not his background (he is a journalist). I agree with his fundamental premise that people do have the choice, capacity and responsibility to replace their habits. Habits are not a person's final destiny; instead, they are behaviors we pick up because of external conditioning. His premise gives hope that even companies that are not doing too well, are able to turn this around, addicts are able to attain sobriety and dropouts can attain corporate success if they want to.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone looking to understand what motivates us to acquire certain habits. By understanding this, you are better placed to begin the process of transformation. However, the book falls short of telling us how we can practice better habits or replace one habit with another.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|There are many problems with this game. 1. This game costs $7.00! This game sucks! If I knew what it was like before I bought it I wouldn't have even paid $.99 for it. 2. It says it only needs like 1. something mb's but after you install it it says that an extra 602 mb's has to be installed! 3. It freezes up constantly. My kindle fire has crashed multiple times while playing this game.<br />4. This game is boring. After you beat it all you can do is free roam which is so boring because you cant even beat up people you can just spin your web and fly which gets boring after 5 minutes.<br />Please listen to me do not go by what the other people say it should not have this high of a rating. They are just trying to con you out of a lot of money and storage. Trust me it sucks! I should sue them for just using the word the AMAZING spiderman.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is an extraordinary musician.  Certainly prodigious.  The complete package.  His band is top notch as well.  The sound quality and camera work on this blu-ray are astounding.  A must for anyone's collection.
0307957934|2.0|Not to give too much away, the storyline here rests on the notion that some automated reasoning software has essentially \\"become an organism\\" and much like the HAL 9000 in 2001 it's turning on its master.  As with his other books, the pacing is absorbing but anyone who's worked in software, engineering or any sort of IT in fact will need to turn off their brain and accept this somewhat silly premise.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed his other books, Fatherland, Enigma, and Pompeii but this one I would recommend giving a pass.

B008JGSM6G|2.0|I really liked the idea of this game, and was happy to try it, however upon playing the first puzzle, I discovered the whole board didn't fit on the screen, there seems to be arrows at the bottom to adjust this, but they do nothing on my phone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Downloaded this book for my mom while we were together on a road trip. Had heard the name but not the details so I had to blush when I got home and started reading it for myself. Some of the scenes were redundant but I fell in love with the book and the characters early on and look forward to reading it each day. Immediately downloaded book two then book three and I loved all three.. Hope the author gives us more to read about these characters soon.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I mostly read this book to continue to discover the characters and how they evolve and continue into the trilogy. All the love scenes were okay, but not my main reason for reading this trilogy though.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well, I don't normally read these types of novels but with all the hype this has been creating I figured I'd get a sense for myself. Generally, I enjoyed the storyline and characters. After a while, the numerous love scenes got old.
0439023521|5.0|I finally read this book after the 10th person mentioned to me how great it was.  I was reluctant because it didn't sound like my genre, not really one into futuristic or fantasy books.  Didn't get into the twilight at all or harry potter either.  I'm older than the target ago group, etc.  And I was skeptical could it really be that good, but I was pleasantly surprised. The writing is great and you instantly care for these characters and want to find out what happens to them.  Some bits were a bit out there for me (not to give things away but some of the creatures that attack were a little weird to me) but as a whole the book was quite well done and couldn't wait to read books 2 and 3.  They were all good, although the 3rd one was a little bit of a let down. Books 1 and 2 were awesome.
B005LAIHZY|3.0|This movie gives kids the wrong idea about what being BRAVE really means. Merida, in my opinion, was the least \\"brave\\" of all Disney heroines. Sure, she did things the others would never do--climbed mountains to drink from waterfalls, rode through the forest shooting targets (awesome, awesome, by the way) but most of that was recklessness. When it came to real courage--doing what was right, and sacrificing herself to do so--Merida fell flat. Most of the time, she was selfish, impetuous, and angry. She had reason to be, at times, what with the arranged marriage and all, but..<br /><br />Merida was a brat. The top reviewer mentioned that this is a great story for strong-willed and independent girls. Well, I am a strong and fiercely independent girl, and Merida and I had little in common. I, too, would object to an arranged marriage, and fight against it--do all in my power to prevent it--but I wouldn't do what she did. I love and respect my mother. I would never go find a magic potion and \\"change\\" her, like Merida did. She didn't know what it would do to her mother. It could be something horrible. But Merida didn't care. She didn't even hesitate. She only thought of herself. Then, when her mother changed into a bear, Merida wasn't overly concerned for her mother--just for herself, because of how much trouble she was in. And then she got her mother out of the castle, to prevent her father from killing the bear, not out of bravery, but rather.... necessity. Yeah, that's a good enough word for it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I loved the first 45 minutes or so of this movie. The animation was incredible, the acting was skillful, the action scenes were great, the dialogue was funny, the premise was good. I was cheering for Merida during the archery scene, when she beats all the suitors. However, after all that, I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />There was a lot of inappropriate content in this movie. And yeah, sure, most Disney movies have little things here and there--as I've discovered recently, after going back and watching favorite childhood Disney movies--but they're subtle, and young children won't even notice them. However, in this movie, it was anything but subtle. For example:<br /><br />When Merida got her mother out of the castle after turning her into a bear, all of the men got trapped up on the castle ramparts. In order to get down, they took off their kilts and made a rope with them to climb down. So we got to see their naked posteriors from behind. Yippee. We REALLY didn't need to see that. And it didn't even make sense. They were all wearing cloaks, and shirts--so why not use those? It seemed that Disney was just going for the shock factor here--well, consider me shocked.<br /><br />Another example: At one point, the three toddlers are trying to find this key. There's a female servant who spends the entire movie prancing around in this severely low-necked dress. And, oh-so-conveniently, the key falls down the front of her dress. What do the toddlers do? They dive in after it. Yep. Into her cleavage. For a key.<br /><br />The top review for this movie mentions that it's silly to be complaining about nudity in an animated movie. Um, I'm sorry, but did you WATCH this movie?!<br /><br />Obviously, PG doesn't mean what it used to. I'm not saying that this movie should be PG-13--simply that the nudity is completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Then, at the end of the movie--after Merida has begrudgingly saved her mother--she's sitting on a horse alongside her mother, and says in the narration, something about destiny, and how \\"you just have to be brave enough to see it.\\" And I remember thinking, \\"AT WHAT POINT WERE YOU EVER BRAVE?\\"<br /><br />I hope that Disney will finally make a better heroine someday; one with the kick-butt skills of Merida w/ swords & bows and arrows, as well as the bravery and selflessness of Belle and Mulan. Or even Jane from TARZAN, or Rapunzel from TANGLED, or Pocahontas. (In a word, a heroine likeBUFFY.) And, hopefully, we'll eventually get the amazing music of those older movies too.....<br /><br />I'm usually not this critical about Disney movies. But I had to be tough with BRAVE, because I just expected so much more.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like it. It's fun and addictive. I have it for the Kindle Fire. It works great, but it lags. A lot. Other than that, I recommend it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Since I read the other two books in the trilogy I figured I'd go ahead and read the finale. I actually liked it. It had good action, drama, and a happy ending.
0439023513|4.0|I felt like this book was a let down after books 1 and 2.  It seemed a bit disjointed like the author was in a hurry and didn't spend as much time on the development of the characters or the plot.  Towards the very end there were some actions that seemed VERY out of character (don't want to give anything away).  But i had to read it to see how the story  ended and I am glad that i did.  Would have just wished for a little better job by the author to bring it up to the quality of books 1 and 2.
0307950689|3.0|Good writing, but not as good a story as The DaVinci Code. Once again, Robert Langdon is summoned to solve a mystery filled with ancient symbolism. This time, we don't start with a dead body, rather with a body part, and Robert is again assisted by a female related to the victim - not his granddaughter or daughter, but this time, his sister. Set in Washington DC, combining once again symbolism from the Bible along with that of other ancient cultures and in this story, focusing on that of the Freemasons, we again have an insane antagonist and only Robert Langdon, assisted by his female accomplice, can unravel the symbolic mystery.<br />Like Angels and Demons, this story includes some science and some pseudo-science, blending fact and fiction, new-ageism, Christianity, Freemasonry and a large dose of the author's immagination.<br /><br />The fact that Peter Solomon, a symbolic name in and of itself, really did know what the mysterious pyramid lead to, however, kind of nullified the whole hiding and searching for meaning since it was apparantly already known to him. Why all the life-risking drama if the answer was so simple? Perhaps the author was trying to make some sort of theological/metaphysical statement, but in doing so, I think he lost the excitement and intrigue that is present in his more imaginative book, The DaVinci Code.

B003IY48PS|4.0|I love the Evil Dead series and decided to get them all on Blu-ray and ditch my DVD copies. Well, not so fast, junior. This new Blu-ray release of Evil Dead has a brand new commentary track with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, and Bruce Campbell -- which is great, considering the DVD versions of the film had two different commentary tracks (one with Sam & Robert, and another with just Bruce). It's nice to have one commentary track with all these guys bantering, but they should have included the previous commentary tracks as well. In the older ones, they spent more time explaining each shot as you watched the film. In the new commentary track, they pretty much ignore what's happening on screen and just talk about how the film was financed, produced, and distributed -- which is great information. I just miss the old, scene-oriented commentaries on the DVDs. Also, would looooove to have an additional commentary track by the Ladies of Evil Dead!

1433502410|4.0|I am a current seminary student, as is my husband. I probably use this book more than he does, but it is a good resource. However, it's good for a few things in particular, and not everything:<br /><br />ESV translation:<br />Obviously, it's an ESV Bible. If you don't like the ESV... well... then you probably won't like the ESV Bible part! But the notes may make up for it. It's not my favorite translation because I don't feel it's very clear, and misses a few things in translation. However, the notes make up for some of the difficulty, so I can't take off too many points for that.<br /><br />Notes:<br />I'm always curious to know who wrote the study notes and what their opinions and theological leanings are. It shouldn't surprise you that many of the scholars who contributed to these notes are on the conservative, orthodox, and reformed sides of their various fields. However, I would say that the notes are pretty fair, and while they are going to be most helpful for someone who is a moderately conservative evangelical, they do a good job of pointing you to other parts of the text and helping you pick up new connections and information, instead of just theologizing and telling you what to think. The notes help you learn. They don't try to indoctrinate you, unless the conclusions are fairly obvious.<br /><br />Maps and other resources:<br />These are some of the best parts of the Study Bible. There isn't an overwhelming amount of information, to the point of distraction, but there is certainly a lot. A lot of the lists and timelines are organized at the beginning of each book, so you have relevant information all in one place. The summaries are very helpful, and again, make good connections between books. They're helpful to laypeople and grad students alike, and I have used them as both of those people.<br /><br />What's missing:<br />There are no \\"devotionals\\" or personal stories to be found here. That said, I do not like these things in my Bible. I suspect many others who are shopping for this type of product don't either - but it's worth pointing out.<br /><br />The purpose of the notes in this Bible is not to inspire emotions or point the reader towards a certain opinion. The notes are meant to help the reader understand what they are reading - and does so quite worthily.

0061433063|3.0|This was a much more somber visit to Tiffany's stead than her previous three outings, but a good--and important--one nonetheless. Still, it's my least favorite Tiffany Aching book, which is a shame.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed with many of Pratchett's recent books is the overabundance of bloated dialogue. Tiffany doesn't escape this new trend. I think it's a result of Sir Terry having to dictate his books and not realizing how long-winded it makes his characters sound. The book gets bogged down in too many monologues and unnecessary diatribes and not enough plot.<br /><br />There's a lot of character development here, especially with Tiffany and Roland. It just feels like it takes a long time to get going. But throughout it all, Tiffany remains a strong person who does a lot of great things for people. She accepts the fact that life is a never-ending series of choices, not necessarily between 'good' and 'evil' (whatever those are), but just choices. And she's fine with that.<br /><br />\\"Learning is about finding out who you are, what you are, where you are... what you are good at and what's over the horizon, and, well, everything.\\"<br /><br />--chancelee.com

1416955070|3.0|I enjoyed this book more than I should have. There's hardly an original idea in it. The basic plot is ripped right out of Harry Potter. The main male character, Jace, has a question-religion complex with Jesus-y undertones (Jace is a nickname for J.C.). And the finale is complete with a Star Wars-esque revelation in which the bad guy is not only Clary's father, he's also love interest Jace's father. That's right! Accidental incest strikes again! I'm sure some contrived plot device will cause them to not be related so they can continue the flirtation that never actually stops even though they believe they're brother and sister.<br /><br />To summarize: Harry Potter with a sex change + incest = City of Bones.<br /><br />Anyway, I did enjoy the book's sense of humor. It made me laugh when it was supposed to, and I have to give it credit for that. The plot was enjoyable, if entirely predictable, and the action scenes were gorier than I expected and quite well done. The demonic aspect of it gives the story a little more edge than your typical YA fare of this ilk. Eventually I'll read the second one.<br /><br />--chancelee.com
B005LAIISU|1.0|This is in no way like the other three Ice Age movies. It is just plain irritating from beginning to end. The voices of Wanda Sykes, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lopez, and Nicki Minaj are like fingernails on a chalkboard from beginning to end, and every crowd scene is made to sound like a ghetto basketball game.<br /><br />Throw in a stupid take-off of Pirates of Penzance, a bored performance by the main characters (although they made Peter Dinklage into a manic monkey), and you get a stew of pain. I guess they decided it's time for minority voices to drown out the white males, and this is the stupidity they come up with. Blecch.<br /><br />The only good thing about the movie is Scrat, but even that comes out being relatively stupid. The animal goes to the core of the earth, runs back and forth and makes the earth crack up. Riggghhhtttt.

B00845PV16|2.0|The director completely screws up this easy major film.  He does strange camera angles, blacked out shots, and other pointless camera effects.  They add more annoyance than value.
159562015X|4.0|This is how the book works: You buy a new copy with an unused access code. Take a 30-minute personality test on the books website and the website spits out a report about the top 5 themes that represent your \\"strengths\\" or what is basically different facets of your personality. The report is the virtually the same text that comes from the book. The personality test cannot be retaken. The rest of the book may or may not be useful to you as it just a very brief overview of the other 29 themes that may not apply to you.<br /><br />I took the test and agreed with 4 out of 5 of the themes it applied to me. The four that I agreed with resonated with me and the fifth was a little off (thought I felt that throughout the test I may have been a bit dishonest about this trait so I understand why it popped up). This is where the book may come in handy. My boyfriend and I skimmed through each of the themes. When we either recognized the theme in each other or ourselves, we'd examine the section a bit further to see if it was really a true fit with our individual strengths.<br /><br />Some might think that these types of books are similar to horoscopes and can be applied to anybody but the author did a really great job with distinguishing and describing the themes. With the themes that the test applied to me, I read them and felt that it could apply to anybody. However, after going through the rest of the themes and having a loved one review my themes, it's pretty clear that not all the themes apply to everyone. This descriptions are so well-written and well designed that we instantly recognized these traits in ourselves or in other people we know well. If we didn't recognize the theme, it would be like a completely foreign concept so if you don't recognize it, it must not be you.<br /><br />I felt that even though the test wasn't 100%, it was still pretty good. But if you don't agree with the results, reading the book allows you to identify what themes resonate with you or someone very familiar with you. Then you can read the descriptions and action list. If you do end up with a copy without an access code or want to use the book with a loved one, it only takes a bit of self-knowledge and effort to skim through the book and really examine the sections that may pertain to you or your loved one. It is a bit validating to see personality traits defined as strengths. Instead of seeing some aspects of my personality as a deficit, this books frames them as a potential strength and something that you should own and cultivate rather than try to stifle.<br /><br />I did feel that the book was a bit light and superficial. It is a small book and covers 34 different themes so it would be hard to expect that most people would want to in-depth treatise into all 34 themes. Each theme is covered by about 3 - 4 pages which includes anecdotal quotes by people who identify with the theme, a description of the theme and action list of how you can develop these themes into your strengths. In all, it is covers all the bases but don't expect nitty gritty individualized analysis.<br /><br />By reading the entire book rather than only the sections that pertain to you, you recognize themes in other people around you and perhaps interact with them more productively and amicably.<br /><br />It would have been great if it were possible to order the test without having to buy the book or to order additional tests for family members at a discount or at least without having to buy another book. We'd only need one book in a household. Buying another book just for an access code is a waste of trees as the book has now no resell or reading value. It's understandable that products need revenue but I felt that the author/publishers could take efforts to offer the book in an online format with packages for multiple test.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the book as a learning tool about myself in others. I recommend it but don't expect a comprehensive analysis of your psychebut a cursory guide meant to get you at least pointed in the right directions.but a cursory guide meant to get you at least pointed in the right directions.

B005TKD6NY|4.0|A well-written story of life, love and death, set in a University and institutional environment in the late 60s.  The author rolls out many musical and literary references evocative of the times, but this is overdone and seems to be used as a heavy handed mechanism (cheap trick?) to constantly remind of the era.  The protagonist and his circle encounter many suicides in their short lives - and unfortunately, to my mind, Norwegian Wood trivialises the raw agony of this blight on Japanese and Western society.  Still, an interesting character study and if nothing else, it drives you back to a great Beatle's classic to fathom a connection with Murakami's tale.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This is truly a magical book of the joy of being grateful. It has solid realistic examples of how to bring this magic into daily life.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I can't stop listening to it, so I predict this album will always bring me back to summer 2012. I'll admit that I'd never heard of Frank Ocean until I read the recent news about him. The story led me to download his free mixtapes and the track Pyramid from this album, which the artist has made available on his tumblr page. The free music left me with no doubt that I had to pre-order channel ORANGE. So far my favorite tracks are Pyramid and Lost. There's a lot left for me to discover on this brand new album, but it's already earned five stars from me.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I ordered Act of Valor for myself, nonetheless, a few weeks ago I had to opportunity to drive to the Florida panhandle to visit with my brother-in-law and his wife.  I hadn't actually seen them since my husband's memorial service five years ago.  They continue to be my family members who get to Florida every year.  I took the movie with me along with several other items which also proved to be a wonderful way to spend a few days, especially with Tropical Storm Debby.  My brother-in-law is a retired Navy SEAL.  He opted to invite his son and their daughter-in-law, just a few miles down the beach, to join us for the movie. We watched it twice.  The first time was without commentary; the second time was with graphic, authentic commentary and references.  It was a great way to honor our military.
1612130283|1.0|I'm laughing after reading the rave reviews here.  I can only assume these folk don't read much.  I tried to read this book; made it all the way to Chapter 7, at which time I was hoping they'd whip each other to death if and when they finally got to the erotic part.  I have a grandchild who loves to rewrite Japanese anime and is well received on FanFiction, so I'm hoping that maybe, just maybe, she'll get discovered and make movies too. This book is poorly written if you enjoy literature; redundant to the point you want to poke your eyes out just so you're unable to read about blushing and grey eyes and young, white, millionaires who look better than Adonis and who's hung like an elephant.  No plot, no depth, no titillating orgasmic moments to leave this reader breathless.<br /><br />I appreciate authors who are exceptional in their field; authors who make me salivate in anticipation of the next word.... authors who, well hell, who write well. E L James is not one of those authors. I'm going to read the last chapter (I do this when I can't tolerate a book) and hope they're all dead by the last paragraph. LMAO -- ok, that was harsh. If you ever want to read a real book about love, dominance and submission, read The Story of O. Maybe the French just have more insight....
B001U6YI92|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with the packaging of this delicate product. It was sent in an envelope when it shoul've been sent in a small box. It arrived earlier then expected, so that was good!

1843104954|5.0|This is a great place to start to learn about Asperger's. It covers a great deal of material on the subject. I like his position about the DSM IV category, and how it's criteria are too loose. I also like the information about subcategories that go with it, like non-verbal learning disorder, motor disorder etc. Great information for adults as well as parents and caregivers and professionals. Well done.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Pieces can be a little difficult to line up at times. Can be hard to see entire puzzle on the Fire screen, could use a zoom function. Otherwise, a great jigsaw puzzle app with a large assortment of images s available. Nice range of difficulties, although I wouldn't mind seeing more pieces options.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I got this for my cousin because she loves Ice Age. She being only for years old I think its a fun game for her.
B0084IG7KC|2.0|When i first saw this movie at the midnight premire, i was jumping up and down. I couldn't wait to see this. As I left the theater, however, i was disappointed. First of all, Katniss(Jenifer Lawrence) is nothing like the book. In the book, she is a bit more mean. In the movie, she was still a cold hard kind of nasty person. Peeta(Josh Hutcherson) is meaner too. He keeps the same facial expression for the whole movie. Someone said this before, but it needs to be said again. They should have not made it look like the Holocuast. You should NEVER make something that looks like that time. That kind of offended me that they would do that. That time period was horrid and people should just never make something look like that. Anyway, during the actual Hunger Games, the camera was a HUGE problem. It went from one end of the scene to another in a split second. That really irratated me. I couldn't focus. Even the story line is an over-done mess. Like I said in my book reveiw, we all knew Prim was going to picked and that Katniss would take her place. Oh yes. We all knew that Katniss and Peeta would win and hook up. Movie producers, stop using the same idea as a thousond other films. Boy. As a teenager, everyone thought i would say \\"Team Peeta or Team Gale?\\". No. I'm not stooping that low to even talk about that. Anyway, everyone thought i would like it. Last, but not least, stop overrating this movie. Yes it was ok. Stop saying it was the best movie ever because we all know that there were better movies. Well, that's it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because there are so many games.<br />And plus there are more GAMES!!!!!<br />allmost the funest game.
0439023491|3.0|This book was good and bad. Let's start with the good. Katniss and Peeta are finally home! Well, that's the only \\"good\\" part. The rest is just like the first book. Another Hunger Games. Another of basically everything in the first book. Except, Gale gets, like, seriously injured. That was really uncalled for. The things that kind of annoyed me was mainly this. Peeta nad Katniss get married. People expect me to say \\"Awww! How cute!\\". Or \\"Awww! Just like Twilight!\\". No. I refuse to be happy. The love between them is forced. People, get that through your heads! the rest of the book was ok. And just ok. No one or nothing is going to change my mind and that's that. I know hater goin hate, but i can have my own opinion and your going to have to deal with it. Oh, and Peeta faking that Katniss is pregrant. What the hell?? That is beyond nutsy and STUPID. There is just nothing else to say.
B0055AUSAM|5.0|I am a woman with a wide foot.  These sandals are perfect for  me.  The foot bed is so comfortable.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Were do i begin. I am going to try to make this short. This book was a flop. The context was confusing and vauge. I didn't understand what was going on. I'm just going to say this. The book sucked. Katniss was more meaner than ever, Peeta went nuts, and Gale left. When i read that part i looked up and said \\"Why?\\". That was just a writing mistake. Oh, and prim dying. whose ever idea that was deserved to be slapped. Hard. That made Katniss more pissed and stressed than she really was. Even though prim, in my eyes, was a drag, that was just uncalled for. And Peeta? I actually thought that was a nice touch that they hijacked Peeta. It put Katniss in her place. One last thing i think is important is this. The ending was a bad ending to an even worse book. That's all. I may be a kid, but i talk like an adult.
0345803485|1.0|This book is one big waste of time.  It is so bad that I was skipping over some of the erotica.  Very redundant and boring.  Besides being a huge waste of time, it is a waste of money.  Thank goodness I only purchased book 1.  Now I won't waste my money on books 2 and 3.  How can this be a Best Seller?
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It's ok... It's not bad, but I've seen better... I think that they should put more to it. It gets boring. It is a lot like Mario...
0439023513|4.0|I loved this book. I found it to be the most interesting, suspenseful and shocking book of the series. In fact, I would even go so far as to say this is one of my favorite books of all-time...<br /><br />EXCEPT...<br /><br />I found that the ending left something to be desired...and not necessarily due to the fate of any of Mockingjay's principle characters.<br /><br />Perhaps the book's disappointing end (and by end, I mean the last two or three chapters) was unavoidable due to the fact that the entire series has been told exclusively from Katniss Everdeen's point of view. Because of this, the reader only learns information about the ending's spellbinding events through secondhand accounts given to Katniss on the fly. It is a storytelling device that Suzanne Collins used in previous books in the series and was tolerable...until now, in Mockingjay, where she chose to use the device at perhaps the climax of the entire series.<br /><br />That said, I really did love this book and have no other gripes with it other than the one stated in the paragraph above. The action sequences were phenomenal, even pulse-pounding; the characters were all so unique and rich; and the twists were astonishing without feeling contrived.<br /><br />I'm hopeful for the rest of the films in this series. I'm even more hopeful that the final film will help fill the void left by this book's abstract ending.<br /><br />Truth be told, I highly recommend this book and, if you're not like me and actually cry while reading, I suggest you keep a freshly-stocked box of Kleenex on your nightstand.<br /><br />(As an aside, even I have to admit that there was a moment when the book tugged at my heart strings, though no actual tears formed).
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|yeahh this is one of my favorite apps. but idk what the whole deal is with the glitching out cuhs that never happened to me. draw something on kindle fire is all g for me(: hehe
B007XF0X6G|5.0|I have to say that I'm very happy to find out that this movie is one of the very few Motion Pictures that support the \\"appropriate\\" aspect ratio that most people (if not all) would like to enjoy in their movies.<br /><br />WHY SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS ASPECT RATIO?:<br />For those of us who already hate the so called \\"black bars\\" on top and bottom of the screen while watching a regular movie, the Aspect Ratio of 2.40:1 on 3D Home viewing brings back those horrible \\"Black Bars\\" and with that TAKING AWAY FROM WHAT MAKES 3D WORTH THE PURCHASE TO BEGIN WITH, minimizing the effect by a big percentage.<br /><br />Usually I don't mind those \\"black bars\\" on 2D viewing, maybe because we are all used to it by now, plus it doesn't take anything away...BUT ON 3D viewing this is the complete opposite.<br /><br />SO WHAT'S THE \\"APPROPRIATE\\" ASPECT RATIO THAT SHOULD BE IN 3D HOME MOVIES?<br />Most 3D movies right now are NOT being released with the desirable Aspect Ratio that will fill the whole screen giving you the whole 3D effect BUT movies like THE AVENGERS, and the soon to be released AVATAR 3D, are some of the very few that could display with an average Aspect Ratio of: 1.77:1 WHICH WILL take advantage of the FULL SCREEN of your New 3D TV as you expected to display from day one.<br /><br />With that said, This movie fortunately does support that type of Aspect Ratio which makes it completely worth the extra few dollars on the 3D Bluray version.<br /><br />Even with an enormous TV set you wouldn't want to watch a 3D movie with the black bars because...the bigger the TV, the bigger the \\"black bars\\" .<br /><br />ABOUT THE MOVIE IN GENERAL:<br />I did like this movie when I went to see in IMAX 3D, I think it had a good use of the technology.<br /><br />STORY:<br />Story wise I don't think is half bad as many people say...it's not perfect, but certainly enjoyable.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS:<br />Well I personally think the movie studio did better than the prequel from 2010.<br/><br />ABOUT THE 3D:<br />I know a lot people will disagree with me on this one, but I think this movie had the best of use of 3D elements since James Cameron's Avatar.<br /><br />The movie itself as I said it's not groundbreaking but certainly enjoyable, and what really makes it stand out from the pack is how well the director and his team were able to put everything together and make it look Amazing in the 3D Bluray version.<br /><br />If you have a 3D TV and a 3D BluRay player, this movie will certainly make you proud of that investment...I know it did for me.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|This is one of the Beach Boy's better albums.<br /><br /> Joe Thomas's strong hand in its composition and production, together with an apparent autumnal Beach Boys desire to go out with a bang, make \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" a unique and very special Beach Boy record.<br /><br />It is fitting that this first Beach Boys record in many years (and maybe the last) harks back to the earlier era of the group when their music came directly and very powerfully at you, with no apologies to high art. They were the Led Zeppelin of the beach and surf. The tunes that Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys cooked up on the LP's \\"Shut Down Volume II,\\" \\"All Summer Long\\",\\"The Beach Boys Today\\", and \\"Summer Days and Summer Nights\\" presented the group in full strength. \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" and \\"Kiss Me Baby\\" are wondrous songs, evoking tears of sadness and joy at once. \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" sets side by side teenage terror, sweetness and joy. You didn't wonder what they were singing about. You knew. You were overwhelmed by it.<br /><br /> These early Beach Boy classics presented everyday situations-- breaking up with your girlfriend, having fun at the amusement park, racing your car, surfing a wave, being too young to get married, having to stand up and prove you were a man to all the guys, hiding away in your room-- all in an extraordinary light charged with an emotional intensity that both wore you down and lifted you up during a single song. It was exhausting and exhilarating stuff.<br /><br /> Joe Thomas, it seems to me, may feel the Beach Boys best music occurred right before Brian Wilson set out with Tony Asher, then Van Dyke Parks, then Eugene Landy, to make beautiful, quirky, artsy, often mind-blowing sounds. There was an emotional cohesion, he sees (I think) to the Beach Boy records prior to Pet Sounds that was never regained. He helps save that for them, as, I think does Mike Love's hand in the proceedings. Somewhat on the down side, a lot of the funky sounding musical stylings and guitar licks in the upbeat section of the cd carry a cliched late 1970's blue-eyed soul feel.<br /><br />That's not to say that what they once did is recaptured here by any means-- because back then Brian Wilson pretty much did the songwriting and musical conception all by himself, with a little help now and again from lyricists.<br /><br />The songs that open and end the album, \\"Think About the Days\\" and \\"Summer's Gone,\\" are major Beach Boy works. They are stunning and intoxicatingly lovely. In between are two sections. The first is a bouquet of rousing, bowl you over with Beach Boy grooviness. It gets going with the impressive, broad-palette songs \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" and \\"It's About Time,\\" and closes out with the not bad \\"Beaches in Mind.\\" Somewhere floating in between both sections is a really great Beach Boy tune, \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue.\\" It ought to be have been a monster hit in a unique dimension where time doesn't exist and only quality matters. It is also a very witty song, a little bit like \\"I'd Love Just Once to See You,\\" a sly wink at life's pretensions.<br /><br />The second, final section of \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is in the style of Brian Wilson's latter solo work. It benefits greatly from having the Beach Boys on board, though. No one sings like these guys. Yes, his brothers are gone. But these guys are, themselves, his lifelong musical brothers, whom he has tormented for decades with endless vocal takes until they got the perfect sound. And it shows. Beginning with \\"Strange World\\" and closing with \\"Summer's Gone,\\" these final songs on the album comprise an emotional journey not unlike \\"Pet Sounds,\\" and wiser for the wear.<br /><br />\\"Summer's Gone\\" is further proof of Dan Was's comment in the liner notes of \\"I Just Wasn't Made for these Times,\\" that Brian Wilson is capable of writing another \\"Pet Sounds\\" anytime he feels like it.  It seems to reference and blend numerous songs from rock history: the eerie openingcasts a chilly pall on the California coastline, sounding like a mix between the repeating motif in \\"Caroline Know\\" and the spooky theme music from \\"Halloween,\\" as if to savor the joyful fading glow of summer love a midst the advancing future that snuffed it out. I hear snatches of \\"Go Away Little Girl,\\" the \\"Falling\\" theme from Twin Peaks, the musical phrase in \\"Never My Love\\" just preceding the line, \\"You ask me when there'll come a time .  .  .\\" signalling here suddenly ascending violins on the words, \\"another summer gone .  .  .\\" and a Beach Boy cry of anguish choral commentary. Like \\"Caroline No,\\" the song moves along like a winding-down carousel rise and fall. Sending you Beach Boy love.<br /><br />So, the incomparable voices of the Beach Boys ride the big final wave with Brian into the shimmering California sundown of \\"Summer's Gone.\\" This is a Beach Boy classic, a brilliant composition lyrically & musically. Brian Wilson isn't shy about saying how he feels. Caroline said she would never change. Summer promised it would never end. The former faded out into a roaring train. The latter sees a downpour of rain in the rush of the waves.<br /><br />Summer always meant a lot to the Beach Boys. From this record's soaring, swirling, and sublimely anguished goodbye, it is easy to see that it always will.

0307341569|5.0|Dark Places is a great psychological thiller and a terrific mystery.  The mystery surrounding who killed Libby Day's parents twenty-five years earlier is a compelling page turner.  Flynn has it all in here--terrific characters that are likeable, yet deeply flawed, or a certain kind of believable evil, a plot with plenty of twists and turns, strong dialogue and excellent writing.  Libby Day, the main narrator is a woman in her early thirties whose mother and two sisters were murdered years earlier when she was a little girl.  She was the only witness to the murder and her testimony has put her older brother in jail for those murders.  Libby isn't the most likeable of narrators, but Flynn manages to make her sympathetic over the course of the novel.  Libby is approached by a group of amatuer true crime \\"fans\\" and begins to believe that perhaps her testimony was wrong.  She tries to uncover who killed her family in a fascinating tale.  Flynn alternates the narrative between Libby in the present day and her mother and brother on the day of the murders and the narrative slowly peels away the layers of the onion that is the truth about her brother and the murders.  Dark Places is a compelling read.  Enjoy!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|First of all, I MUST disagree with those who complain about Geddy's vocals on this album.  As Rush fans, we all have to come to grips with elements of their music which we may find less than appealing.  This said, no one who knows anything about music can EVER deny the talent and complexity that Rush brings to all of their work.<br /><br />Now, \\"The Garden\\" has to be the most improved / developed of Geddy's vocals of any Rush song.  He has gone so far beyond the \\"hamster in the wood chipper\\" and has produced something truly beautiful.  I love this song for the clean, crisp guitar AND the melodic vocals (all of it, actually).<br /><br />EVERY song has its share of \\"Rocket Sauce\\" (Black 2010).  Whether you like the song as a whole or not, it's hard for me to believe that there is no part of any song where even the most staunch critic can say, \\"Wow, that's cool.\\"<br /><br />The jams are amazing.  They really nailed this one.  I can't stop listening.  Yes, I am a Rush fan, but this is the first album I've been really excited about in a looooong time.  Vapor Trails gave me a bit of hope, Snakes furthered that hope, but Clockwork brought it all home.  Soooo good.  Truly beyond words.<br /><br />The truth is, ALL music grows on you.  I love all of Rush's work; therefore, it's hard to point to a favourite.  It's all good.<br /><br />Thank you to Dirk, Lerxst, & Pratt for so many years of philosophy, beauty, depth, and phenomenal music.<br /><br />Here's to many more! ;o)

1455508977|1.0|I LOVE Nicholas Sparks and \\"THE NOTEBOOK\\" is one of my all time faves. This book however is a total snoozer. Until the very end it is boring beyond belief. The female character is unbelievably dull and they don't do ANYTHING even remotely romantic or exciting. They go from wary of each other to in love with no real \\"moments\\" in between. Its sad that the most interesting character is the ex-husband. Boring. BLAH! A huge disappointment.

0393064476|4.0|This is the story of the last surviving manuscript of Lucretius's \\"On the Nature of Things\\" and the man who found it. Author Stephen Greenblatt crafted a very readable and enjoyable tale. The only weak point of the book was that it was too short and that half the book was notes. I enjoyed Greenblatt's writing style and wanted to read more. After reading this book, I read \\"The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450\\" by David C. Lindberg. Although this book contained a lot more information, it read like a textbook and getting through it was an effort. The two books are complementary but don't read them too close together or the weaknesses of Lindberg's prose will become more apparent. The Swerve was well worth the read for everyone interested in the history of science.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|The repetitive language continues. The bland writing style persists. But at least this sequel in the series has an actual plot. If the writing were better I would actually deem this book good. None the less it is a lot more entertaining than the first.
B006RUJST6|1.0|The novel should have been titled:\\" He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not\\".  Found the lovers to be pathetic and not endearing.  The references to the Avett Bros. and lyrics at the start of each chapter seemed to be a forced attempt by the author to be trendy.  It did not work for me.  Thought I weas reading a script for a bad Lifetime Movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I decided I should go along with the culture and give this book a try. It wasn't one of my best choices. There is no real plot to this story. The erotica is under described and quite bland surprisingly. Which is terrible when 85% of this novel is all sex scenes. The language is as repetitive as the sex scenes. James uses the same phrases time and time again. it becomes overally dull very quickly.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Dollhouse is one of the most well written, and geniusly plotted shows to grace television. With numerous unexpected and clever twists throughout it's two seasons, Joss Whedon's signature wit, a plethora of well conceived characters, a very good looking and talented cast, excellent action choreography, and fantastic use of the limited screen time this show was given, Dollhouse will always remain one of the greatest cult classics of all time. And quite frankly, I feel sorry for the millions of television fans out there who have never had the pleasure of experiencing this remarkable and unique marvel.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was on a list of books I had to choose from to read and write a report on for the weekend class I am taking right now, Childhood Mental Health Disorders for my Master's degree in Social Work. I bought it and finished it in one day! It is amazing, heartbreaking, and completely inspiring. Please read this book if you get a chance. We must remember that how we treat others really does affect them. Though the topic is intense, teen depression and suicide, it is something that our society needs exposure to. This book will change your life and the lives of your teens. Please have your teens read this book too!<br /><br />It upsets me reading the negative comments about how Hannah was whiny and vindictive. I think these reviews were posted by adults who forgot what high school is like and how unsure and scary being a teenager is. Teens do not have the same thought processes as adults and when they try to reach out like Hannah did (albeit not very much) and get shut down, they become defeated. Please take this book for what it is meant to be, an opportunity to learn more about teen depression and suice and use it as a learning tool for the teens in your life.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book took me a lot longer to get into it than I anticipated. This series has been recommended to me forever and I finally decide to shell out the $10.99 for the Kindle edition (something I wasn't very happy about being that the book was released several years ago). The first half really dragged for me and I just didn't feel any connect with the characters. I found Jace compelling and that's the only reason I decided to continue reading. I'm glad I did though. The second half was phenomenal with terrific pacing and great twists. Interested to see what lies ahead for the characters in subsequent books.

It's interesting, melodic, arty, and poppy.<br /><br />I walked into Gotye's MAKING MIRRORS like most new listeners probably have: expecting solid, well-crafted commercial rock.  His breakthrough hit \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" has been on heavy radio rotation for a while now, and it guided my expectations for this album.  The Gotye/Kimrba duet \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" is a solid, tasteful pop song; it's a rare song that succeeds in being a nice piece of authentic songwriting and a commercial hit.  In many ways, this lead single does give a good indication of MAKING MIRRORS: it's both authentic and populist.  However, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" doesn't reveal the breadth that the album really has to offer.<br /><br />The title track also serves as the introduction; it's quiet, sparse, and gone before you know it.  It's a great lead-in to the second track \\"Easy Way Out;\\" a song that bubbling with energy and accessibility.  It's an infectious song whose instrumentation wouldn't feel out of place in a Beck album.  The next song, \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\" stands out as a great track, but it doesn't dwarf the album.  MAKING MIRRORS is littered with great songs, so Gotye's smash hit won't likely serve him a \\"one-hit wonder.\\"  \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" appears to be a single, and while it does have a great melodic hook, it is much more atmospheric than the album's lead single.  \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" has proven to be easily one of my favorite tracks on the album.  It's spacey, jazzy, and punctuated with a fantastic brass section.  It isn't until this song that listeners can be convinced that MAKING MIRRORS isn't aiming to be another pop record -- it has something else in mind.  This song, like many of the others that come before and after, doesn't sound like it could have possibly been written by the songwriter of \\"Somebody That I Used to Know.\\"  This songwriting versatility proves to be one of the most interesting facets of the album -- listeners never know what to expect with the next track.  The following \\"I Feel Better\\" is especially adherent to this.  Inspired by Motown, USA, \\"I Feel Better\\" would sound just fine on a CeeLo Green album.  It's poppy, infectious, and incredibly creative.  \\"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching\\" is a sparse, electronica-tinged song that proves to be another highlight.<br /><br />For all of its merits, sometimes, I don't think that all of Gotye's experiments prove to be a success.  I wasn't much of a fan of most of \\"State of the Art\\" and its distorted vocals and sprawling instrumentation.  By the end of MAKING MIRRORS, I felt like what I listened to was a grab bag -- it's often scattered and too diverse for its own good.  At times, it feels less like a cohesive album and more like a compilation of songs.  These minor gripes however don't prove to be much of a criticism: MAKING MIRRORS is largely a success.<br /><br />MAKING MIRRORS is definitely one of 2012's best and most interesting releases.  There is material here for everyone, however, I have a feeling that some listeners will be upset that there isn't more songs like \\"Somebody That I Used to Know.\\"  For those listeners who enjoy a bit of experimentation with their melody, this album will prove to be a great listen.  Fans of Peter Gabriel will particularly find a lot here to enjoy.  Those who enjoy this album are encouraged to also check out fellow Aussie Kimbra's [[ASIN:B0080YGZ20 VOWS]] -- it's not as experimental, but it has the same spirit.<br /><br />Standout songs to download/sample: \\"Somebody That I Used to Know,\\" \\"I Feel Better,\\" \\"Smoke and Mirrors,\\" and \\"Easy Way Out.\\"  Be sure to give this album a listen!f the album -- listeners never know what to expect with the next track.

0345803485|1.0|Worst book I have ever read in my entire life and I have read several hundred books. The characters are annoying, the dialouge repetitive and boring. Christian is a control freak nut and Ana is whiny and idiotic. Nothing is believable. Highlights include: (spoilers)<br /><br />1. Oh you just threw up let's go dance<br /><br />2. OMG a coffee shop! I don't drink coffee. They have tea at coffee shops, ugh.<br /><br />3. She's never drank or held anyone's hand and she's 22. Did she grow up in a box?<br /><br />4. OMG you're a vigin, ok let's go cure you of that right now. Um ok.<br /><br />5. Jose' wow so ethnic, omg so there's a black guy yeah he magically appears after she see's only blondes and thinks it's weird. That wasn't on purpose.<br /><br />6. Buying me stuff makes me feel like a hooker but this contract doesn't!<br /><br />7. Omg how dare you buy me a car and a laptop and a cell phone. I'm so ungrateful and obtuse.<br /><br />8. Sex scenes are so boring.<br /><br />9. Let's type out the contract three times during the book to bore you to tears.<br /><br />10. Omg don't spank me, ok give it to me rough, omg you did I hate you we're breaking up. I just realized how sick you are.<br /><br />Worst. Book. Ever.

145470246X|5.0|Wonderful, amazing, gorgeous. I waited a long time for this book, and it was worth it. Every beader should have this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is extremely addictive,  very easy to play but very difficult to put down. Graphics nd Colorado are very easy on the eyes. The price was well worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got it like at night and I played it for a long time....I went to bed at 12:30 playing this game. very fun
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are fun and adivtive. especially when bored. I suggest download. my daughter also enjoys playing the banes. have fun! :)
B00633W614|5.0|This story kept my interest the entire book.  The characters are likeable, you want to read more about what happens to Harry.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. better than the original that I played as a kid.  will probably play until no longer free. keep up the good work.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This may be the best comedy ever!  If you are against very crude behavior and humor,  don't see it!  It is the funniest movie I have ever seen!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I loved the book and love the series even more.  For a long time i would not watch the series thinking there was no way it could outclass the book:  I was wrong!  This is by far the best acted western I have ever seen.  I won't go into all the plot etc. as there are many other reviews that do so.  I just want to say this is perhaps my favorite film of all time, just like the book is my favorite book.  Casting was perfect, book adaption very smooth, all around excellent.
B003ZHR6T8|5.0|It was a very entertaining movie.  It kept my wife and I were glued to the TV set.  Michael Douglas played a good part.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|This lens hood does what it's suppose to. It is nice to have and I see no problems with it causing a shadow when outside even at 18mm. When indoors is when you see the small shadow at the middle caused by the built in flash. Around 24mm is when it is not visible no more. Overall not a big problem and is a good product.
0525478817|5.0|I love books that make me experience the whole spectrum of human emotion while reading and The Fault In Our Stars by John Green met this requirement and exceeded it. I had never read any of John Green's books before I read the Fault In Our Stars so I did not really know what to expect but as soon as I started reading I knew I had made a mistake by not reading his books sooner. The Fault In Our Stars is about two teenagers who meet in a cancer support group. Hazel is funny and her cancer is controlled for now but she has to have an oxygen tank wherever she goes. When Hazel arrives at support group one day she meets Augustus Waters a handsome and charming guy. Augustus and Hazel begin to hang out and talk about things. We soon learn Augustus is more than what meets the eye. Hazel and Augustus begin to become more than friends and Augustus makes Hazel look at her life and her sickness in different ways. I love the conversation Hazel and Augusts have. The conversations are so thought provoking and hilarious at the same time. I also enjoyed reading a book where the characters do things and are realistic. The Fault In Our Stars made me realize sometimes the faults in our life are in the stars and not in ourselves. Hazel and Augustus might just be my favorite couple of 2012 and possibly all time. I have not given The Fault in Our Stars a review that really gives it all the credit it deserves. So as a last thought I would recommend the Fault In Our Stars to everyone.
B000N90JG8|5.0|It's funny, it's kind sad, and it's heart warming too. I can relate to Diane Keaton's character but I don't think I would have made the choice that she did in Paris. Enough said, it's a good movie, get it, guys, it's a chick flick, get it and give it to your girl.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Billy Corgan is Smashing Pumpkins like Conor Oberst is Bright Eyes. Essentially a one man show with accessory musicians. Gone is everyone but Billy. I don't know the names of the new crew yet, but they fill their roles very well.<br />We kick off the album with what sounds to me like an homage to the pumpkins of the past cherub rock intro. Alas, the trademark sound is missing and its very obvious. Corgan has traded up for a very tight and well produced studio rock sound instead. This is not a bad thing, but you know the song is just there to be loud as there really is not much to it but hammering away on one note.<br />The next track, Panopticon, is much more fleshed out and has some serious chops to it.<br />  The Celestials is a great track and the hints of an upbeat vibe the chorus of Panopticon gave you are confirmed here, then the 2nd half of the song takes off into hypersonic rock drive.<br />  Next up is my favorite track of the album, Violet Rays. A somber but heavy song, which I think are Corgan's bread and butter and what he does best. I think its an excellent hybrid of Corgan's style with the new band, but not as ambitious as most of the tracks on this album.<br />  My Love is Winter is a good song but could have used some better lyrics. It bugs me simply because I know Corgan can do better. This is where the album takes a wrong turn and loses a star.<br />  One Diamond... ughh. A repetitive cheesy synth loop of a song. I made myself listen to it twice. Skip. Pinwheels. Didn't I just suffer through a terrible synth loop? If you're patient though, it ditches the synth and treats you to an ineffectual acoustic treatment where the new bass player sings some harmonies. Nothing special, but a welcome sound after all that synth racket.<br />  The title track, Oceania, is taking the best that Corgan and his new bandmates have to offer and putting it all together in one fell swoop. It works well and the song in a song is very well done. This is where the album should have stopped.<br />  Pale Horse is just bland. The next 3 songs all sound like they would be B-sides to the rockin' Pumpkins of yesteryear. Its as if Corgan was trying to reclaim some of his former glory instead of breaking new ground. The closing track Wildflower has nothing wrong or right with it which leaves you thinking less of the album than you should.<br />  There are 6-7 maybe 8, solid songs here. Based on the merits of those songs, I give this a 3.5 of 5 stars. The muse hasn't left Corgan yet, but he really needs to exercise better discretion on what is A vs B side material.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I love Phantom of the Opera so much and the music is beautiful. So I just knew this was going to be awesome. Well it's not, it's pitiful, there is not one good song in it and the story line doesn't fit with what happened in Phantom. I would not recommend this movie. Don't waste your money or time. Sad to say it simply is not worth it.
B008K8U13K|5.0|this game is awesome. I really love and so do my friends this game is awesome. u should really buy this game
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun game. a few pop up ads. worth it tho for a free app. watch out. very addictive :) have fun!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Now i will admit that when i went to harder/timed i became flumuxed setting it so you have the &quot;ABC'S on colors helps to get puzzle brain in gear.  So if your looking to enjoy according to your &quot;pipefitting&quot; level you will enjoy
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Edgar Rice Burroughs (creator of Tarzan) wrote A Princess of Mars in 1912.  It, and all of his work, is pulp fiction at its best (or worst)!  What it lacks in realism, character development and import, it more than makes up for in action, adventure and good story-telling.  Scientific understanding, of course, goes out the window.  Even in Burroughs'  time, it was well known that Mars was a frigid, lifeless planet.  Yet Burroughs' planet Mars, if I recall, was a hot, dry planet, populated with all sorts of humanoids and beasts. Silly but imaginative, his books BEG to be made into fun summer movies.  Now, 100 years later, with CGI, we have the capability to do his imagination justice.<br />John Carter is worth watching once, maybe twice, for the action and special effects.  It's superior to Episodes I, II, and III of Star Wars, for sure.  Particularly neat about the special effects is the steampunk appearance of the flying machines.<br />So where did the Disney folk go wrong?  In the CASTING of the humans!  Taylor Kitsch does nothing but scowl the entire movie.  He's too damn scrawny and his hair's too long and scraggly. And finally, with dark circles around his eyes, he looked white and sickly against all the red-skinned Martians.  A better choice for Carter, in my opinion, would be Chris Hemsworth (or his brother), who played Thor. Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris, the Martian princess, is OK she's but not much of an actress.  At one point she cries but sheds no tears.  With the millions spent on special effects, couldn't somebody have sprung for glycerin drops?<br />In Burroughs' book, Carter is immediately smitten upon his first view of Dejah Thoris and battles all of Mars to win her love.  Disney's Carter and Thoris have no chemistry together and you get no sense they are in love.  The computer generated green Martians and even the Martian dog have far more emotion.<br />So my recommendation is to do an Amazon rental of this movie. I don't feel it's worth owning.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book on Tuesday based on a recommendation from Gizmodo.com, hoping for something that would entertain me for the rest of the summer.  Unfortunately, it's Friday night now and I just finished the entire book.  It has exceeded my expectations in every way.  Honestly, seeing the story form and the online publishing style I was expecting something severely sub-par, but this is one of the best books I have read all year.  I can't think of anything to compare it to, but it might be something like halfway between The Hunger Games and Battlestar Galactica; it has much the same kind of fascinating and twisted dystopian government as The Hunger Games, with all the grit and intrigue of BSG, but that comparison is probably a severe insult to what Wool really is.  Read it.  Whether you are looking for entertainment that will keep you up all night reading or something that will make you think and maybe even question the world you live in, you will find it in Wool.
0345803485|1.0|The fact that this book made the Best Seller list has ruined my faith in the Best Seller list.<br />I downloaded this book onto my ereader at the price of $9.99. I want to sue the author to get my money back.<br />A complete waste of time and money. Total garbage. The worst book I've ever read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds is an awesome exciting and sometimes aggravating app but its still very very very fun mine and dine is very hard
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great Book!  I am not a Stephen King fan just for the simple reason that I don't enjoy horror books or movies but, this book is very different.  I enjoyed every moment of it from start to finish.  Its more a mystery with a little bit of Sci-Fi thrown in there.  Very well written and historically acurate when necessary.  Definitely backing the conspiracy theory that Lee Harvey Oswald wasn't quite alone but done in a very interesting way.  Great Read!
0763655465|5.0|George promises to be good. He HOPES to be good. But when left on his own, and presented with irresistible (to dogs, that is) opportunities like eating a whole cake, chasing the cat or having a lovely dig in the dirt, he just can't help himself! When his human friend Harry returns, George apologizes and turns over a new leaf. A much improved George resists -- up until the very open-ended ending. \\"There's nothing George likes more than digging in the trash. What will George do? George?\\"<br /><br />This was a hit at storytime. Interestingly, most of the kids I've read this to thought that George would continue to be good, while only a few thought he'd give in and dig in the trash. There's a limited palette of colors in the retro-looking art, dominated by burnt orange. If I had to bring up a minor quibble... I wish the pictures had a little more color or were easier to see when reading to groups. Burnt orange and hot pink have tendency to blur together. Still, it's a distinctive style and a humorous story.  All in all, a really fun book.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game is pretty fun.  I just don't appreciate being forced to log in to facebook and create reviews after purchasing.
1468161660|5.0|I never write reviews.  I'm pretty sure this is my first.  For anything.<br /><br />I LOVED this book.  LOVED it.  I fell in love with these characters so quickly, and so easily, that I never questioned how quickly it happened for the two of them.  I was surprised at every turn in this book.  I smiled.  I gasped. I cried.  My heart broke when I came to the end of the book.  Because, although the story ended nothing short of perfectly, I needed more. The story didn't end at a place where it felt like it NEEDED to be continued, but I felt that I NEEDED it to be continued.  This book reached out to me in a way I wasn't expecting.  Even reading the 2nd book of this series quenched my need to continue these characters life.  I'm not ready for their world to be over yet.
B007IQX1G4|1.0|I am a huge fan of Charlize Theron....but this movie was so awful. I watched the whole thing thinking \\"it has to get better...\\" well,  it doesn't, then it is over and you are disappointed you have wasted your time and money on such a flop! Don't waste your time!
B008COPZ60|1.0|He's another manufactured singer! yes he writes his own stuff but his vocals are just completly auto-tuned out now! when he first came out at least he had a bit of a voice now he's trying to be Justin Timberlake.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|This book targets young adults and that is why there's not a lot of &#34;meat.&#34; Instead, it is very lighthearted. Miranda's goal is to inspire girls and young women to believe in theirselves and conquer life's daily obstacles and she does this by telling her own life experiences and her favorite quotes that she lives by. I recommend this to girls and young women.
B005R4PGQM|5.0|This CD is beautiful in every way! Each song will capture you and hold you through out each and every song! I actually bought four more of his album and gave them as gifts because I felt like I had a dirty secret or guilt because of how amazing this album was and I hadn't shared it! Every family member or friend absolutely loves the album! All of them! Darren Hayes does music right, he doesn't need to sell his music with a body and curves. I don't need to write an explanation for all of the songs because several people have done so and they are correct! I am writing this review to give him the rating and make sure he gets the credit from the excellent work he put into the album. This CD will be on replay, and you simply wont be able to get enough of its brilliance!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|This album really surprised me. I love almost every single song in this album, except for 1. Yes, this album is (again) different than the rest but that's what I love about them, I love how every single album sounds different and It's not the same thing over and over again. Living Things has a combination of all their previous album, which makes it even better. There was some song that I didn't like at first but they grew on me really quick. Overall I have to give this album a 9.5/10
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Come on ppl it's a free download and just like every app the have to make money somehow. If you want to play for free u have to play in increments.  If u want to play all day then u have to pay. I play in increments once in the morning; sometimes midday and once in the evening. This way my energy is fully replenishedand if I want to play more than that well I have to pay. When using ur energy make smart decisions. Don't construct a building when u only have 1 energy left since it takes about 3 to 4 energy to complete a building and if u do just know that u won't be able to complete it until u get more energy. I think this game is one of the best free downloaded available.  Just exercise a little patience and sound judgement and u will love it!
B00009NHC5|3.0|being blind in an NYC basement appt is scary enough, but to tackle bad guys using ingenious tactics to get the upperhand was truly impressive and unexpected, Audrey is convincing as a warrior instinct survivor and does well to maintain and extend the suspense beyond typical fearful life threatening scenes, was thinking her screams may possibly have been heard given she seems normal, has local friends in the building but no mention of callousness of neighbors to help another... more likely in dense woods, deserted highway etc.  all the hullabaloo for some minute contraband imho, geez, some operation... nonetheless great to see the empowerment of a disabled woman and save her family from the evildoers of NYC!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|angry birds may have some very hard and time consuming levels,  but it's extremely fun and that's what makes it all worth it. I recommend this to anyone,  any age,  anywhere.
0140569324|5.0|It might not be quite as sturdy as the original, but the book I ordered seems to be the standard size that I originally purchased over...was it really 20 years ago? Now that I think about it, maybe we had the hardcover version. But, this paperback version will more than suffice. I remember my daughter jumping up and down on the bed, reciting every word of this book by heart. We read it together so many times that the pages began to shred. I'm looking forward to grandchildren, and want to make sure I can share this book with them too, and keep the family tradition going. I mean, who wouldn't love a Very Hungry Caterpillar who loves to eat salami? :)
B007IQWQ88|5.0|I have really been enjoying listening to these recordings. E.g. the recording of Liszt's Rhapsodies is marvelous as it reverbrates throughout my house. Splendid! The major composers are all here in wonderful \\"Karajan\\" versions (if one likes Karajan of course).<br />This is a great collection for individuals wishing to get familiar with Karajan and/or the \\"warhorses\\" of classical music. Obviously \\"completists\\" will be thrilled to have access to this collection as well. Otherwise it is very likely that most of us have extreme overlaps with this collection considering the repertoire. The CDs range time wise from thirty minutes to more than an hour, but they are generally shorter as the goal is to replicate the original releases with album covers etc in a similar fashion to the RCA/Sony releases of Gould, Horowitz and Heifetz. Regardless, it is a bargain with 82 CDs for this price [July 2012]. Karajan aficionados will not be able to resist this collection. Buckle up for 80 hours of listening!!! If you enjoy classical music you owe it to yourself to experience these recordings.  I hope you enjoy them immensely for many years to come!<br /><br />BP= Berliner Philharmoniker<br /><br />CD 1: [45:42] Strauss, R.: Ein Heldenleben, Op.40, BP<br />CD 2: [43:51] Brahms: Hungarian Dances / Dvor&aacute;k: Slavonic Dances, BP<br />CD 3: [57:04] Liszt: Mazeppa;

B007MNV5WU|4.0|the app is awesome dont get me wrong, but I beat the lvls a long time ago. Still waiting for an update!!
B002Q1YDLI|2.0|MAJOR SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I had read the first book, \\"Something Borrowed\\", because I was having difficulties finding something from my usual selection of reading material. I found the characters, all of them,  in that book to have major character issues and this carried over into the next book.  Going into the story I knew how self centered Darcy was but it seemed like everyone she met in this book were very similarly thinking, it was all about their appearance and their standing in society.  The only character worth knowing was Ethan.<br />Darcy flees to London, England after she finds out that her best friend is hooking up with her ex-fiance, the man she had been having an affair on with his friend and happens to be pregnant with this mans's who wants nothing to do with her,  she also discovers that her family is disappointed with the choices she has made for her life the past couple months. Ethan agrees to a visit from Darcy but secretly Darcy plans to stay for longer than a visit.  She immediately blows through her savings, buying high end clothes that won't fit her in a couple of weeks due to her growing belly. She continues to consume alcohol. After being told by Ethan that she does not think of many other people before thinking of her self Darcy decides to make a list of ways to make herself into a better person. Don't get me wrong, she does change drastically,  but since the book shows a lot from the point of view of what Darcy is thinking you still see her with a very competitive thought process or often finding praise for those with high-end belongings. One of the things on her list is to get a job helping others so she attempts to get a job at a nursing home for which she has no experience but her thinking is that she previously had a job in PR so she is good with people, lucky for the elderly people in the home she gets turned down. Another item on her list is to take better care of her pregnancy so she makes an appointment to see a doctor,  discovers she is not having the girl she wanted but twin boys. She eventually ends up dating her doctor, who is her ideal man-handsome, distinguished, and wealthy. Eventually she attempts to make up with her family, discovers she is in love with Ethan. Yes, by the end of the book she does make changes but I think she is the type of character who will for the rest of her life always be mentally comparing herself to everyone else.<br />BTW, has anyone else ever heard of the pencil test before? It was new to me until I read this book.<br />if you have read \\"Something Borrowed\\" you might as well read \\"Something Blue\\".
1589795474|5.0|I highly recommend this book, specially to young people who want to learn how to reach financial independence. Although statistics are dated the essence of the book still applies to nowadays.
030758836X|4.0|I love, love, loved this book! It was crazy at it's finest! just when I thought I knew what was happening, another curve was thrown and I was shocked as heck! I do agree with the other comments that the ending was a little disappointing, but I'm not really sure how else it could have ended. Great read... keeps you entertained-- would recommend.
B00007KGCW|3.0|I got this DVD because it was region 2, but I was really disappointed that there was no option for French language :(
0345529057|2.0|I can not believe I just read 7000 pages of this tripe only to find the ignorant author did not bother to resolve what happens to the characters.<br />Buy another 2000 page book to find out what happens to the characters in the four book series you just spent a month reading?!  One's born every minute Martin, so no doubt many will take your bait. I've had enough of you and your complete inability to finish a novel.<br />Amazon readers, unless you intend to dedicate your entire life to reading Martin, I recommend you read books written by someone with less disdain for his readers. Also, if you like a story to have a beginning, a middle and then end, these books are not for you. They do not end. Reading them has the same effect as reading War and Peace, losing the book halfway through reading it, then being hit by a train and killed on your way to pick up another copy. Now that I think of it, that would be preferable as it wouldn't add the feeling of being ripped-off by the author and his publisher.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Bought these headphones for gaming and listening to audio for work.  Today, while listening to the audio for work, the surround sound died.  I get no sound at all from the right side.  I open the software that came with the headphones and, according to that, it's coming in surround sound.  Of course, my 30 days to return them ended yesterday!  Very, very disappointed.  I can't believe I spent $100 on headphones and they're a pieced of junk!<br /><br />Update:  Company worked with me and after much finagling, they sent me a new headset.  I've waited several months to make sure they weren't going to do the same thing.  They have been working great since receiving the new ones.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great version of the game and it kept me busy for hours. It is brightly colored<br />and if you choose it will finish the game for you once you've won. I would recommend it for anyone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game it is very fun ! My town (Tinsel Towne) is very very very busy ! I have so many trucks it's not funny :)
B005KR6OBM|5.0|The comedy is well written, humorous without resorting to crude language to obtain cheap laughs. The science is real which adds to the appeal as the concept is so unusual.<br /><br />Delivery was prompt. The only criticism doesn't pertain to the subject matter but to the packaging falling apart as the material it is made from is disintegrating.
B006Z4LOPK|5.0|Love this series, it was pricey....but well worth it. The DVD came early and in excellent condition (new), as stated.

B002ZG97M4|5.0|I love this movie! It is different than the old one but I love the modern take on a classic :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome this game is great to pass the time especially when you cant sleep.I love playing it for a long period of time because of the variety
B00005Y7L4|5.0|Yes, this is better than HG, which I saw at the show lsat week. I reson I'm buying BR is because I saw it on Netflix but no subtile. BR is better than HG as there is no story set-up. With BR there is action from the get-go.
B007G5K066|5.0|Comparing this movie to the BBC series with Alec Guinness is unavoidable. That one is completely loyal to the book. It is almost as the book was filmed page by page. There is also a lot of style and interesting ideas there. The first scene of the first episode when the agents, one by one, enter the meeting room and Percy Alleline says \\"gentlemen, let's start\\" is unforgettable. We knew right away that we would be for a good ride.<br /><br />This one has a quite different take. It is a only a two hours movie and they knew there was no way they could develop the characters as in the book and the BBC series. At the same time, we have a more developed George Smiley. This new version has very little to do with spies, moles or who betrayed who. This movie is not centered on that. We have instead several George Smiley close-ups, talking to us as if the only thing between his soul and us was his big glasses. He became a very deep character.<br /><br />If someone watches this movie without ever reading the book and watching the BBC series, will only get the tip of the iceberg. This is not a James Bond or a mystery movie.<br /><br />The cast, all the technical aspects, the use of music, that's one of the rare events that I recognize innovation, fresh ideas and coherence in a movie and that a film director has something to say. His name is Tomas Alfredson and I will keep my eye on him.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thank you, Hugh Howey, for this completely absorbing work that is filled with unexpected turns and vivid imagery. If you, potential reader, are not convinced by the numerous five star reviews to purchase this omnibus, then it is entirely your loss. I'm not sure there is anything meaningful I can add to what's already been said, aside from just another small voice urging you to read this wonderful masterpiece!
0061692042|1.0|I just didnt like it and I had really looked forward to reading it, it was so boring and telling things before they happened, just seemed to spoil it.
B008JAFXOQ|2.0|Just never had legs. Would like a refund and my time back. I love the lead actress in True Blood. Her part just came off as whiny and unbelievable.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I have been a Chris Brown fan since day 1...I have all of his studio albums and mixtapes...I love them all...There was no exception to this one. I love various types of music, and I think he captures a little bit of everything  on this album....From r&b,pop,dance, and rap...Some of my faves are: Sweet Love, Biggest Fan, Stuck, Baseline,Don't Wake Me Up,Trumpet Lights, Tell sombody...Whoa that's half of the cd..I recommend anyone to purchase it...I gurantee you'll find a couple of songs you like if not the whole album.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|Finally ! It took long enough for this absolutely incredible legendary performance to be released ! Miss Ross \\"waited a lifetime to get there\\"...and We waited a lifetime to re-live the performance of her lifetime!<br />As a lifelong Miss Ross fan, it was unimaginable that this concert was held back for 30 years......I remember, literally being glued to the TV, watching...hanging on every note, thrilled with every movement, having seen Miss Ross many times in concert...each one a new and different experience....<br />Her devotion to her music, her fans, her intensity in delivering tunes that many of us grew up with......her beauty, her elegance, her stage presence, always the true perfomer, you could feel her sheer joy in making us laugh, dance, sing a long....<br />The rain didnt stop her and with courage and dignity she held on as long as she could....and true to her word, returned the next day.....<br />Critics be dammed....Miss Ross is and always will be a Lady, a Legend !<br />Now if they would get busy and release her 90 minute TV Special \\"Diana Ross..Here I Am \\".......
B004QL7K70|5.0|I rented this movie about a week ago. I was not sure if I was gonna like it.. epsecially due to the way it was filmed....But I actually enjoyed it alot... It was funny as h***....I mean the party was epic every teenagers dream haha...It  was a pretty good movie though I definetly would purchase it..
B004GF244K|4.0|Excellent acquisition. I`m pretty much satisfied. It was very nice to see Ringo, Paul and Eric in a very good shape and singing better than ever.
B006RUJST6|5.0|What a great book.  I read it in one day - just couldn't put it down.  I was so thrilled with the story, I order the next book and read it on day 2.  The editing could have been improved.  I was wary because some of the YA books tend to be silly but these characters were mature and believable.  I agree with all of the reviews that are amazed that a debut book had so much depth and complexity.  I read lots of books and this one made me cry - more than once!!!  That is a shock for me.  I wish the second book had been as good.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|If you are looking for a story line this is probably I waste of time, I found myself skipping pages and pages of sex scenes just to try to find a story line. If on the other hand you are buying for the sex scenes might a suggest a google search would be cheaper and less time consuming...
0345803485|4.0|Wow...I just started reading this book yesterday and I don't want to put it down.  I had some interesting dreams last night!  I am not a fan of control freaks but it makes for interesting reading!  Will definitely finish the book today,
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I thank John Lock for HOW I SOLD A MILLION EBOOKS IN 5 MONTHS.<br />It is one eBook with solid how to and general information.<br />I so agreed with his urging writers to work at the business of<br />marketing the book, and how consistent the writer has to be, and how tenacious.<br />The time to read it was well worth the effort; the money spent to buy it was far<br />less than its value.<br /><br />Martha Tucker
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It's a great way to pass time. if you like bakery or restaurant story you will like this game also. looks cool on the big kindle screen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an excellent science ficttion book. Kept me enthralled the whole time and wanting more!I would guarantee anyone a good experience with it.This guy needs to raise his prices!!
B006OITIQE|1.0|This is a true masterpiece that speaks volumes about all fans of One Direction.  This band is going places.  It will make the Backstreet Boys look like 'Nsync, and Menudo like Ricky Martin.  I find the chords used on Track 5 highly reminiscent of the retro style popularized by Buddy Holly and, to a lesser extent, a little-known indie band called The Beatles.  I find this album a prime candidate for all Grammy Awards that are up for grabs for the next 20 years (give or take 2).  From the first moment I read about this band on 9gag, I knew these kids were for real.  They are truly the Justin Biebers of their generation, and may even (God willing) reach the ultimate heights of talent best epitomized by Carly Rae Jepsen.
0307949486|4.0|This book is terrific!  You have to get past the first 200 pages and then it flies.  That is a long time reading, but believe me, it's worth it.  The relationship between Bloomqvist and Salander is very interesting.  I think the author handles this perfectly, as well as the very difficult subject matter.  But the true genius is on the next two books.  The second book takes about 150 pages to get thru & then it moves swiftly.  The 3rd book starts fast and never really lets up.  If you haven't read either of these last 2, the author does something I've never read before regarding 2 main characters.  This \\"something\\" is neither sexual or physical.  Even though I can tell what he does and it's not really a spoiler, I prefer to not say.  Let me just say this trilogy was the best I've ever read.  Even better than the Bourns' books.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book was page turning until it got to the last few chapters!  I don't read as often as I should.  If I could find more Trilogy's  like this one that would change.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the ending .
0425263908|5.0|Very entertaining and fast read. Characters and simple yet important to the plot. It is a cross between Twilight (which I hates) and 50 Shades (which I loved). Go ahead and make the purchase. You will not regret it.
B004AP9W46|5.0|I've read several Anne Rice books and I've loved them all.  I went into reading \\"Memnoch the Devil\\" expecting the same sensuality, thrills and twists that I've enjoyed in each of the four preceding novels from The Vampire Chronicles series.  But, in addition to the expected, this one took me places that made me examine my own spiritual journey - quite unexpectedly.  A great read - \\"Memnoch was a page turner from the beginning through the end.  As this was the first book I've read on a Kindle (I just got around to buying a Kindle Touch), I don't know if the technology had anything to do with the speed of the read, but I fully enjoyed the experience.  I'll have to dive right into some other books to see if I get the same effect.  Anyway, if you like Anne Rice, you'll love \\"Memnoch the Devil\\".  This book is rich in depth of both charachters and scenery.  Loved it!!

0062206281|3.0|It may be a stretch to call Prisoner of Heaven a potboiler but it does not come near the quality of the prior two books in the series.  This entry is much shorter than its predecessors and seems to rely on a knowledge of the world and characters of those books for its resonance, rather than developing this identity within its own pages.<br /><br />The plot of Prisoner is familiar as it reprises The Count of Monte Christo while filling in some of the blanks in the lives of series characters such as David Martin and Fermin Romero De Torres.  There isn't a great deal of character development in this book's brief pages.  And the magical realism of earlier volumes is isolated in a short and somewhat forced visit to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, shoehorned into its final pages.<br /><br />In a harrowing prison sequence, the author develops the strongest character in the book: the evil Mauricio Valls.  As the book jumps to its current time in 1960, Valls has used writings stolen from prisoners to become a leader in Spain's political and literary world.  Unfortunately, the mystery of Valls ascent as well as of Daniel Sempere's tale of revenge is not concluded in Prisoner of Heaven but in classic cliffhanger style is announced to have \\"only just begun.\\"<br /><br />The initial Amazon reviews of this book are positive and expansive.  Sometimes, if a reader likes the world created by a writer, a simple return to it is enough.  I suggest that for most fans of the series, Prisoner will be found to be slight and disappointing.  For a reader who is entering the series with this book, it will be even less rewarding.  A series volume should be entertaining in itself while moving the larger story along in a significant manner if it indulges in the luxury of so obviously leaving key plot developments  for future reader investment.  Prisoner passes the first but not the second of these tests.<br /><br />Zafon is an entertaining writer and Prisoner is fun to read.  More of a beach book, it does not achieve the sustained world-building success of prior volumes. I am hopeful for a comeback by the author as Sempere's quest to find the truth about Valls is followed.  But the author must consider the challenge that Gregory Maguire overcame in Book 4 of his New Oz series, after an equally tepid third volume.  Zafon's Barcelona must expand even as more of its secrets are revealed.  The author faces the difficult challenge in an extended literary series of retaining continuity to reward reader familiarity as he breathes fresh air into the plot with new concepts, characters and interests.

1582406723|5.0|This was pretty freaking awesome, my very first graphic novel and what an introduction. Like many others I picked this up because I'm obsessed with AMC's [[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead]] and wanted, well I just wanted more. I was also curious about the graphic novels, I'd heard they were good but I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much, I mean they're comics right, how engaging can they be?<br /><br />But DAYS GONE BYE captured my attention from page one and managed to hold me hostage for the entire hour it took to read, giving me a real sense of sense of anticipation, anxiety and fear. I think what makes this so good (besides all the awesome zombie arse kicking) is that Kirkman has managed to capture the human story so well, which I didn't expect. I found myself really caring about the outcome of the characters even the ones I didn't know because they hadn't made it into the TV series.<br /><br />On that note probably the most fun for me here (and purists will hate this) was comparing the graphic novel to the TV series. What they used, what they changed, how the characters look etc. The outcome of this book is very different to the end of season 1 and surprised the hell out of me. And while the dialougue can be kinda corny the black and white artwork is awesome; detailed, -you can see their breathe when it gets cold, realistic(?) What I mean is they don't look like superheroes all muscles, tiny waists and huge boobs. The zombies are seriously disgusting and the kill shots (on both sides) are amazing. Yup this was a great read and very, very addictive. Looks like I'll be splurging on [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead:  Compendium One]]after all. Cheers<br /><br />Volume 1 follows officer Rick Grimes from pre apocalypse shootout through waking up alone in the abandoned hospital. We then trail him as he meets bicycle girl! the flat end of Morgan & Dwayne's shovel and starts to adjust to life in his new zombie filled world, before setting off to Atlanta in search of his wife and son. No tank scene there but he rides that ill-fated horse and gets rescued by Glenn who takes him to the encampment and other survivors.f his wife and son.

0345803485|2.0|I usually don't like to be critical, and so much has been said about these books already, but as someone who isn't really \\"in\\" to this kind of genre, I was curious and started the book with an open mind.<br /><br />I liked the plot, but was very turned off by the writing style. It seemed a bit amateurish, if that makes any sense when describing a book that's sold so well.<br /><br />People who like easy, cheap thrills will love this book, but if you're looking for a very involved story with \\"deep\\" writing, look elsewhere.<br /><br />In short, some people like Hemmingway's shot, staccato sentences; some people like Fitzgerald's long, symbolic ones.<br /><br />Fifty shades of Gray is like neither; it's more like someone just learned English and decided to write a sex book.<br /><br />I will say some of the explicit scenes were *WOW* in their graphic detail, but what even more shocking is the utter cheesiness of this book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really enjoy this game wen i hv some down time......the effects are really good. like the fact that there clips of the movie in the game
B00332CWLW|3.0|I really really wanted to love this book, but instead I find myself giving it 3.5/5 stars. Im not really sure why, the writing was very lyrical and McCann is clearly one of the better writers in terms of making you feel like you are actually looking in on the characters through a window and seeing it all unfold first-hand. He also switched well between all the different characters and changed 'voices' to make sure you were aware of their individual personality and story. I guess I just feel that while I was reading it I just got a little bit bored. There was nothing really propelling the storyline along other than just looking at a snap shot of their lives and what New York was like in that era.

B0031RS4UM|4.0|Enjoyed this early Jack Reacher novel, action and reasonable plot to keep you interested as the story progresses to its conclusion with enough twists to keep the interest and momentum.
0425263908|5.0|I loved the 50 Shades trilogy and found this in my search to read similar erotic romances. Boy, was I lucky to find this book!! I never thought it possible to read anything better than 50 but this one has the edge. At first I must say I thought it started out a bit too similar but as I continued to read it became unique in it's own story. What I loved most about it was how the author got the reader so absorbed in the main character's and how it was steamy and very erotic without all the bondage/pain/dom/sub entering into the story. It was very juicy from page one to the last. A page turner as I was sad to finish reading it and I crave a sequel which I found comes out in October - which I already pre-ordered. I don't care what other people say, I am a tough critic, thank you Sylvia Day!
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Good music, excellent mastering, Brian Eno is awesome! It has a rich mix that has depth and color that flows like a miracle from God. The only problem is all the damn haters. The only reason it sounds bad is because you are too close minded. Get real.

B0040MF1XK|4.0|This is a wonderful set of the 32! A joy on the ears, very little pounding here. This is not \\"angry\\" Beethoven, but a poised, lyrical Beethoven, never harsh, but full of fire. Lortie sees each sonata all the way through, not glossing over parts to get to the \\"virtuoso moment.\\" Beautifully played, beautiful sound. If you have found others in this repertoire to be a bit rough, this may be the set for you! Right up there in my top choices with Kempff, Lewis, Brendel, Frank and Gilels. And Solomon too, if he had completed the 32 on record; in many ways, Lortie's playing and approach remind me of his most of all.
B007V508CC|3.0|You have to know that Maroon 5 are all about pop. This is what they excel at, this is what they do. It is safe to say that the band has been relatively generic from the start. I mean, when \\"Songs About Jane\\" was released in 2002 it was not all that different from, say, Train. So they have gradually become more and more produced, and less and less acoustic. Adam Levine is their best asset. He is a very good singer, but the rest of the band, well, the type of music they adhere to could easily be made today by any number of up and coming new artists. Their identity rests solely upon Adam Levine's vocals. His voice is distinctive enough to be recognizable, but not so unique as to add character and depth to the identity of the band.<br /><br />This band grew up together in Los Angeles, which is a far cry from, say, U2, who developmentally are similar, but musically and lyrically, far more poetic and advanced than Maroon 5 could ever hope to be. And that's my throw down to this band--I challenge them to make more interesting music. Each of their albums is different from the others, but yet they all sort of lack an identity. They are well crafted, yet not fully rewarding experiences.<br /><br />And so we have \\"Overexposed\\" which sums up the band--overplayed, and Adam Levine judging on \\"The Voice\\"--overexposed. A joke, but so true at the same time. And this continues the trend set by 2007's \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" That slick, overproduced, bubblegum pop sound that has literally highjacked any originality over the past five years or so. Yes, Maroon 5's last three albums sound like they could have been made with all samples and no musicians. You know I just reviewed Rush's latest release, and those guys have a musical identity. You can tell it's Neal Peart pounding away on the drums, or Geddy Lee thumbing away on the bass guitar, or Alex Lifeson struming the electric and acoustic guitars. They are unique and distinct. The same can't be said for Maroon 5. They are a product. They sound like a producer came in and pushed some buttons and out popped \\"Overexposed\\". And worse yet, the band is already rumored to be working on their next album! With such a quick turnaround I wonder if it will be half-baked ideas.<br /><br />At any rate, \\"Overexposed\\" has some good songs on it just like all the rest of their albums, and then it's padded with filler (also like all the rest of their albums). The easily identifiable hits are front-loaded on the album with the first three or four tracks being the obvious standouts such as \\"One More Night\\", \\"Payphone\\", \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Lucky Strike\\". After that, it becomes a slush fest. \\"Sad\\" stood out only because it is a ballad that interrupts the faceless dance music found throughout the album. The three bonus tracks don't add much.<br /><br />I was particularly offended by their version of Prince's 1986 classic \\"Kiss\\". The band strips the song of all its character and lethally adds an additional three minutes to the original length of the song making it a 7 minute lounge act. The Art of Noise did a much better job in 1988 with Tom Jones on vocals (much, much better). Atrocious--Maroon 5 should burn at the stake for it.<br /><br />So, I give \\"Overexposed\\" three stars--above average, but just barely. They really need to go back to the drawing board and realize that they do not need to make manufactured pop. They could really stretch themselves and pick a producer that would be a curve ball like Rick Rubin, Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, Ric Ocasek, Billy Corgan, Jack White, Butch Vig, William Orbit, Fatboy Slim, Will.I.Am., Timbaland, Bob Rock, or David Byrne. That would be interesting. I know they used Robert John 'Mutt\\" Lange on their last album, but while he perfected The Cars, Def Leppard, Starship, Bryan Adams and Shania Twain, he did not do much for Maroon 5.<br /><br />So, here is how \\"Overexposed\\" compares to Maroon 5's previous works:<br /><br />1997 The Fourth World (as Kara's Flowers): I haven't heardthis (yet)<br />2002 Songs About Jane: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 It Won't Be Soon Before Long.: Four Stars<br />2010 Hands All Over: Three Stars<br />2012 Overexposed: Three Starsthis (yet)<br />2002 Songs About Jane: Three and a Half Stars<br />2007 It Won't Be Soon Before Long.: Four Stars<br />2010 Hands All Over: Three Stars<br />2012 Overexposed: Three Stars

I am 79 years of age so I have been around the block a few times and I am not interested in animated films; but this family film was so impressive for me to watch that I have watched it more than once, each time I see things that I missed before.The animation is superb. The action scenes were enjoyable to watch especially when they came out into the living room.  I cannot say enough about this film.  I would recommend it to any one.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|...seeing this overly long documentary about the creation of a Metallica album that few fans care about, myself included. I did enjoy being a voyeur; seeing how Metallica go about recording \\"St. Anger\\" and living their insanely wealthy lives. Everyone knows Lars Ulrich has an enormous ego, that came as no surprise. What surprised me, was that I walked away from this documentary having less respect for James Hetfield, who comes off as a bit of an egotist and also because he enjoys killing bears. I just don't like that. I have a lot more respect for Jason Newsted now, that's all I can say.<br /><br />It would have been super-cool if the filmmakers had followed Metallica around while they were recording, say, \\"Master of Puppets\\", or even the Black Album, instead they recorded the birth of one of the worst heavy metal albums in history. This documentary is not particularly good or bad, there's certainly nothing fascinating about it. Decide for yourself.

The return of the Billy & Co. might be just the giant shoe we need.<br /><br />I'm going to listen to this album a lot. I'm quite sure it's going to be the album of the Summer of 2012!

But in so many ways it was a great book, so I will just say the author was using her creative license to write whatever kind of ending she wanted.

1442419814|3.0|First off the bat, Tally rubbed me all sorts of wrong. All she could talk about were pretty people and how she couldn't wait to become one. She reminded me of that scene from A Bug's Life...<br /><br />Bug one: Harry, harry no! Don't look at the light!<br />Bug two: I can't help it... it's so beautiful.<br />!!Zap!!<br /><br />That was Tally when faced with a Pretty. And when she wasn't being enraptured by the Pretty, she was full of condescension. Consider these lines/thoughts by her:<br /><br />pg 76 Their ugly little faces peered up at the dorm's four-story height, their eyes full of wonder and terror. Oh I hate Tally and her attitude.<br />pg 81 \\"Don't be weird, Shay. I'm an ugly, you're an ugly. we will be for two more weeks. It's no big deal or anything.\\" She laughed. \\"You, for example, have one giant eyebrow and one tiny one.\\" Tally being the biggest jerk as she talks to her friend.<br />pg 198 \\"What are these freaks?\\"<br />\\"They aren't freaks,\\" Shay said. \\"The weird thing is, these are famous people.\\"<br />\\"Famous for what? Being hideous?\\" Tally talking about people in our modern day magazines.<br /><br />Need I say more? Let's just say, Tally and I didn't hit it off.<br /><br />How about the plot? The beginning was rather rocky, and I wasn't sure I'd even finish Uglies. Once Tally started focusing on other issues beside just being pretty, the book improved. I couldn't help but be interested in what happens during the Pretty process. I had a hard time believing a child could grow up thinking they're were ugly and worthless all their life, then after a surgery which fixed the outer imperfections they'd have high self-esteem. Then the Smokies were introduced, and I had to know what that was about.<br /><br />Uglies also had a bit of romance action. At first, the romance seemed so fake considering it came out of the blue. But sometimes, I guess that's how it happens. Just having someone take notice can create an attraction. In the case of Tally falling for an Ugly, I'd say that's what happened. After all, she was quite superficial throughout the story.<br /><br />Over all, this wasn't the best read, and the presentation wasn't all that great. However, the story was unique to me. It also ended on a cliffhanger, which I absolutely hate. I'm just glad the series is over, and I have the complete collection. Now I can read (or not read) them at my leisure.gly, I'd say that's what happened.

0812993292|5.0|While I was reading this warm and wonderful novel I had an atlas of England close at hand and kept track of the progress Harold Fry was making on his walking journey.  It added another element of enjoyment to this simply fascinating story.  Every once in a while my husband would come and ask me to show him how far Harold had walked.  It gave us both a connection to the story and a means of discussing it.<br /><br />At first you have to take the story at face value and just accept that Harold, or anybody, could make a momentous decision such as walking from one coast of England to the opposite coast almost into Scotland.  If you question the advisability of that decision so early on, you will probably never settle into the possibilities of Harold being successful at what he did.  A whim, a spur of the moment decision, completely unplanned and never before tried by Harold are just some of the descriptions for his unlikely idea.  Yet Harold knew the secret he held in his heart which made him desperate to see his former co-worker Queenie Hennessy before she died.  Along the way Harold's journey touched the lives of everyone he came in contact with.  Ultimately it touched the lives of people he would never even know.  This journey didn't just impact Harold and Queenie, it also concerned Maureen, Harold's wife, who was left behind without even an explanation.  What causes a marriage to come apart and will the walk change the lives of those involved in that marriage?<br /><br />This is a poignant and moving story.  It will definitely make you rethink grudges and petty differences you are holding on to.  I loved the descriptions of the English countryside with the trees and flowers and wildlife Harold came to know.  I was awed by the descriptions of the quiet and the noise and the solitude and the congestion Harold found.  I actually found myself concerned about the blisters on Harolds feet.  But mostly I was encouraged by how people reacted to Harold on his heartrending, impossible, beautiful pilgrimage.  What a marvelous reading experience this was.mpossible, beautiful pilgrimage.  What a marvelous reading experience this was.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Not sure how many ways I can idolize a book or a series.  Following a horrific car crash, I now have a lot of problems reading for more than 5 or 10 minutes at a sitting.  It took me 6 months to finish the GOT series (instead of maybe 6 weeks in the past).  In that 6 months I read nothing else.<br /><br />Perfect books draw you into the story until the characters become real and part of your friends.  After you quit the book, you grieve because you no longer spend time with your friends.  This is that type of book.<br /><br />Perfect books have complex characters.  Assuming that \\"Avatar\\" is the epitome of one-dimensional characterization, I can assure you that GOT is pretty much diametrically opposite to this practice.  I love a character.  I hate the character.  I am ambivalent towards the character.  Even tho I'm ambivalent I can't wait to see what happens to them.  Good characters are bad; and bad are good.  Convention is never drawn.<br /><br />If I were to nitpick?  On Kindle, you can't read the blasted maps.  Characters carouse, march, and muster all through a new world and you are pretty much clueless as to if it is a far cry or a short hop.  Imagine reading LOR and not knowing where Bilbo is or where he is going.<br /><br />Also, GRRM writes the books in sequential chapters that follow different characters.  All chapters end on a bit of a cliffhanger.  You will then need to read 2-20 chapters to pick up the thread.  Consequently, I read the books out of order.  I followed the character throughout (skipping chapters merrily) until I came to the end of their story and then read the next chapter, picked up the next character, and then read only their story.  I do NOT recommend this practice and hope to hell you have more self-control than I did and eschew this filthy habit.  Read it in order.  Makes much more sense that way.<br /><br />Have recommended this series only to people who love reading, as not everyone will commit to multi-thousand page sagas.

B004O3YGMC|1.0|This app requires bloatware on your remote machine, there are free versions of RDP that use windows native RDP (2x is one).  Further you cannot return or get a refund for your apps purchased.  I wasted $5 to learn this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome I love it. I love the unlimited life. its a lot of fun. keep it coming. thanks so much.
B00884GR0W|4.0|Minecraft-esque without being a rip-off. The RPG style quests really make the game. The only change I'd make is the addition of a d-pad option instead of joy stick only.<br /><br />Buy the damn game already!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|this game crashes constantly on my razr maxx with ics. even though it crashes i was enjoying this game until i realized that i had to get people to be my neighbors to expand my restaurant. if i wanted to play a game like this i would play on facebook.  i dint want to be forced to have neighbors. im uninstalling.
B006362ZR6|5.0|Don't know why I waited so long to get this CD. It is great and not one bad song. I can't stop playing it all week since it arrived. I have 2 other Fray albums and love their music. Some songs get me a bit emotional. Great melodies and vocals. I am a long time metal head but like to mix it up by listenening to other types of music. Get it you won't regret it.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Draw Something is a very entertaining and fun game to play. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy this app. (Believe me, I can barely draw a stick figure.) It's loads of fun to play with people you know and just as fun to play with people you don't. App runs smooth and I've had no problems out of it. The only thing I run into that I dislike is when I play a random opponent and they don't draw! It's no fun to play with someone who just writes out the word! It is called DRAW Something after all. :) I just delete those games. Have fun and let's draw something!!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Bought these for my husband and he loves them. You can hear other players sneaking up from behind..and you hear them....from behind!! Excellent pricing! Very satisfied!!
0156027321|3.0|It's a fabulous read.  I enjoyed every word of it.  But the message embedded in its themes is specious and possibly immoral.  The novel posits the idea that fables (including religious stories) constitute a better way of looking at the world than rationalistic/scientific approaches do.  Don't get me wrong; I agree that imaginative storytelling has great value and can yield many positive benefits within a society/culture.  But this novel goes too far by implying that it's better to completely delude oneself with comforting fictions than to confront the hard realities of the world.<br /><br />Moreover, the protagonist repeatedly belittles the rationalistic/scientific worldview by referring to it as \\"dry, yeastless factuality.\\"  Only the simple-minded and ill-informed could describe the the observable universe revealed by modern astronomy and astrophysics, or the endlessly complex narrative of biological evolution, as \\"dry and yeastless.\\"  Nor can it be assumed (as the novel seems to suggest) that narratives about god (many of which include such horrors as genocide, conquest/pillage, animal/human sacrifice, and apocalyptic yearnings) are inherently \\"better stories\\" than non-supernatural (scientific) narratives.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are fun and not easy! Makes for a relaxing rainy day or whenever you have got some time to kill!
B005LAIGSC|3.0|Denzel Washington: One of our greatest living actors. Ryan Reynolds: One of our most charismatic young leading men. A supporting cast of Brendan Gleeson, Vera Farmiga, and Sam Shepard. The subject of SAFE HOUSE: A young CIA case officer (Reynolds) and an extremely experienced former CIA agent-turned-traitor (Washington) are the latest in a series of mismatched, \\"unlikely alliance\\" partnership as they flee from a squad of hired killers. As they go along, the young agent is gradually feeling the influence of the older, hardened \\"I know how things really work\\" former agent. Does that last part sound familiar? Good, because it should, especially when it comes to Denzel.<br /><br />The film opens with Reynolds proving how physical and buff he is by a few rounds with a punching bag, and a shower with his ridiculously sexy French girlfriend. Reynolds plays Matt Weston, a case officer for the CIA who's sole responsibility is being the \\"housekeeper\\" of a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. He comes in, checks the supplies, turns everything on and waits for something to happen, as he's apparently done for the previous twelve months, but nothing ever does. On the other side of the city, Tobin Frost (Washington) gets something from a contact, kills a man trying to kill him in a bathroom, gets shot at, crashes cars and runs to the US Embassy in Cape Town. His arrival prompts everyone back at Langley to go ape. Apparently Frost turned rogue nine years previously and he's been selling secrets to different countries during all that time, and is an expert at psych profiling and turning assets. So Shepard, playing a high-up muckity-muck directs this operation to get him moved to Weston's safe house, as lower echelon operators Gleeson and Farmiga quibble about how best to approach Frost. Of course once Frost gets to the safe house (and is waterboarded for good measure), several armed hostiles break in and impossibly kill all the trained men responsible for guarding Frost, but Weston gets Frost out, and they begin committing mayhem all around Cape Town with car chases, shoot outs, epic fisticuffs, more car chases and more shoot outs, while Frost does his best to get under Weston's skin and shake his conviction and the mystery of the information Frost has reveals some bad people amongst Weston's CIA handlers. Who is it? Is it Farmiga? Gleeson? Shepard?<br /><br />The things that I will give this film is that it definitely has momentum, and there is some interesting chemistry between Washington and Reynolds. I say \\"interesting\\" because it's obvious that Reynolds, as charismatic as he is, is no match for Washington, but that's actually part of the point of this film, just in the way that Weston is no match for Frost, mentally or physically. The only thing that Weston still has is his belief, but no matter what because of how predictable the film plays itself out, you know that he's going to lose that belief by the end. The film does really move from one heart-stopping scene to another, though, and really that's the only thing that keeps this film decent.<br /><br />From a performance standpoint, Washington is certainly not at the tip-top of his game, but he does deliver a strong performance here as someone who has obviously seen and done far too much. Reynolds plays the naive-yet-preternaturally-talented agent pretty well, considering they could have played more to his strengths as the cocky, rebellious type if they had decided to go down that road. The saddest thing here is the waste of supporting talent. Extremely talented character actors like Farmiga, Gleeson and Shepard are all stripped of the ability to play real characters and instead play cliches, and that's a shame. The villains of the piece are just there to shoot, fight and look menacing. Even strong but lesser-known actors like Joel Kinnaman (THE KILLING, the upcoming reboot of ROBOCOP) and Liam Cunningham (GAME OF THRONES and about every other British or Irish role out there) are given NOTHING to do here.<br /><br />Director Daniel Espinosa, doing his first major Hollywood film here, throws a lot at us during the runtime of the film, consistently building momentum, but doesn't do anything particularly fresh here. His style seems to be a kind of mash-up of Tony Scott and Paul Greengrass, and they've done far better films than this.<br /><br />Really when all is said and done, going to the SAFE HOUSE is a road we've taken many times in the past and some of those roads are a LOT better, but at least here, there are some interesting things to see during the journey.en NOTHING to do here.<br /><br />Director Daniel Espinosa, doing his first major Hollywood film here, throws a lot at us during the runtime of the film, consistently building momentum, but doesn't do anything particularly fresh here.

0738727326|3.0|This is an art deck. It is lovely beyond measure but for me at least is horrible for doing a reading with. I ended up trading it away.
1401232590|3.0|After finishing The Long Halloween, I was underwhelmed and a bit disappointed.  I know that many people consider this to be one of the very best Batman stories, but I personally can't see it.  I agree with most of what the other 3-star reviewers have stated, and I'm relieved that so many people see the same glaring flaws with this story that I did.  It lets me know that I'm not alone in going against the grain here.<br /><br />The dynamic between Dent, Gordon, and Batman is interesting, and that's where most of the \\"good\\" in the book is.  The problem is that it all feels rushed.  It feels like half of each chapter was edited out, because each section just barely scratches the surface of what is being implied.  Rather than letting us see the emotional impact of the multiple families being affected by the events unfolding, we're instead treated to a bunch of cameos from Batman's more famous adversaries who come and go with very little point.  The mob story is interesting enough without the parade of characters.  I feel like the point of \\"new criminals pushing out the old\\" would have been much better served if the writers had picked one, or maybe two villains from the rogue's gallery and woven them more tightly into the overall story.  The St. Patrick's Day chapter with Poison Ivy was especially pointless.  It's a wasted opportunity that we were given chaff like that instead of expanding on the more meaningful elements of the plot.<br /><br />And the ending... just awful.  I want to go into more detail, but I want to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.  I'll just say that I get the impression from the way things were wrapped up that the writer neither knew nor cared who the \\"Holiday Killer\\" was until it came time to reveal it.  It boggles my mind that anyone can get to the end and be satisfied with the result.  Not only is it hokey, but it's a total cheat as far as storytelling goes.  It came completely out of nowhere and left me feeling like the whole storywas nothing but a fart in the wind.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I loved this book! I usually get my books from the library's online service and you get 21 days to read them, well I tend to read slow so I almost always have to re-rent the book to be able to finish it. My point is that this book was so good that I finished it in 14 days! I  had a hard time putting this one down! I intend to read all of Denise's books!!<br />Thank you Book Bub, Amazon & Denise for a great read!!! I am now a lifelong fan of you all!
030746363X|1.0|Recently I listened to his interview.  This was the only reason I checked this book (4 hour body) from the local library.  It was pure waste of my time.  Of course it still provided me with another data point on marketing ploy.<br /><br />Sheer nonsense.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game was soooooo much funnn! it is entertaining and made me want to play it all day longggg!!! fantastic!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|sure its not that great to some of u but I DONT CARE IT IS AN AMAZING APP AND U PEEPS WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT<br />TO:OMGPOP great app
B007MAETA8|5.0|Really enjoy this album when I'm just relaxing. Its got a 70's acoustic Neil Young feel to it. Great sound quality too. Get it!
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I am loveing this adapter. I am able to record music I recorded from Taiwan during the Vietnam War and the sound is as crisp and clear as the day i recorded it.  The program loaded easy, and is simple to use.  Can't find a fault with it.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|First of all, I love all of Fiona's work including this one. This one takes a few listens to appreciate it. I'll probably give it 5 stars after a few more listens as it keeps getting better. A casual fan probably won't appreciate it. Fiona fans should check it out!
034580404X|5.0|At work it's the topic of all the female workers, we are trying to get the men to read it!  In the first book, yes it was alittle bit like \\"porn\\" but it was enjoyable.  I rather read, then see it.<br /><br />I would love another series!
B00846TRHY|5.0|Powerful and moving story that you will never forget. Makes you realize that we are blessed to live in America. I knew that terrible atrocites took place in the Sudan, but this film gives life to the words I have heard.  Gerard Butler is a great actor and was wonderful as Sam Childers.  When God moves the heart of someone like Sam amazing things can happen.
B007SGM084|4.0|Had to read because everyone around me was reading it. It was ok but not much story line.  It would have been nice to see more story development.
B001LM1456|4.0|As a couple who grew up with comic book heroes such as Superman and Batman on TV and later watched Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno on their weekly Hulk series, we enjoyed the new movie, The Incredible Hulk.  In comparing it to other movies of the superhero genre, we weren't blown away by it, but we had few complaints.  It was a fun stay-at-home date movie, and something we wanted to watch prior to seeing the new Avengers film.<br /><br />For us, personally, we would have liked to have seen the plot begin earlier in the Hulk's history -- to see how he became the Hulk.  The beginning credits do a fairly good job of catching the viewer up by showing newspaper headlines and short video clips that depict that story in brief, so someone who had really never seen a Hulk story before wouldn't be totally lost.  I think we're just used to the \\"typical\\" superhero movie spending more time on the creation story of each main character.  I could appreciate by the end of the film why the producers chose not to spend unnecessary time on that aspect -- so this particular episode could bring us farther along in the story without making the film unbearably long.  I guess it just felt more like a sequel to us.  If you watch it with that idea in mind, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />The story line, acting, and special effects were all good.  Again, we really had no complaints.  Of course, it's not 100% believable, but I think that's to be expected with this type of film.  One watches a superhero movie to be entertained, not educated, and to see good triumph over evil.  The Incredible Hulk did not disappoint in any aspect of that formula.  I'd say it was a \\"worth seeing\\" movie, but not necessarily a \\"must see\\" one.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Super awesome app.  Free music and videos, what can I say.  Get this app if your cheap like me.  Make sure put Hq after all your searches to get the best high quality sound. Your welcome!
B005LLX582|1.0|I just watched this and could not tell you what it was about. I kept turning up the volume to try to hear what the characters were saying but could only make out about half of the words. Seems like a story about a little kid growing up with an abusive father and loving Mother. Centers on one kid in the family who seems to be turning out like his father. The ending was completely crazy, the father loses his job and they pack up the car and I have no idea what was going on after that. First I thought they were going science fiction or something. If this is art then it is bazaar.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this unless you at least watch a preview.<br /><br />I see a lot of people love this movie and I normally love deep alternative type films but this was just a bunch of images and not even a good soundtrack. I watched it to the end thinking something would come together but it never did.
B002ZBPPHA|5.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is an awesome movie. I enjoyed it very much! Movies on Amazon so far for me play perfectly. It is a GREAT way to rent a movie that you want to see and then if you really like it, you can buy it at a great price. Thanks AMAZON!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Was sorry when it ended & I wish they had ended it so more could have been written.
0345803485|1.0|Well I'm half way thru the book and all I am is MAD.  It's not even believable.  First, I hate first person books - all that he and I he and I he and I - just distracts from the story.  Then a 21 year old virgin?  Give me a break!  And that virgin is willing to give it up just to be f****d because Christian doesn't do making love?  No way.  A 21 year old virgin still believes in the fairytale of love.  The inner goddess thing is BORING.  And this 'hero' should be shot.  He beats women and enjoys it.  Her first 'spanking' in her own bedroom is 18 slaps that are so hard she's crying! I can't use the words I would use to describe him!  He needs to be put out of his misery.  Not a turn on.  I am sorry I bought the whole triology.  And this is a best seller? Sounds to me like the reading population needs therapy along with the author.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is my new King favorite. I loved every part of this book. I will read it again.
B000OVLINI|5.0|What a refreshingly interesting and intricate story the author tells.  The way he sets the story up and follows it through... You can't put this book down. Almost depressing when it's over. Definitely going to read more by him. So different and rich. Each character comes to life.  5 stars all the way
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is pretty good. I'm going to tell my friends about it. I want go play the games that are coming soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|totally addicting and amazing I love how the game is made and how you can use power ups and cheats.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|one of the best mahjong games lots of games the up grade was great also it lets you re shuffle any time and three clues but it jams some times
160309007X|4.0|At one point during this story, someone asks Mina Harker what it's like to be immortal. She replies that the first 70 years are great, but after that...<br />There is a tremendous sense of fatigue emanating from our heroes here. It's 2009, Mina Harker has been missing for 40 years, Quartermain's fallen apart, Orlando has been, um, killing time and the whole Moon Child crisis seems to have been forgotten. It's only when Orlando receives a less-the-gentle reminder from the Blazing World that he/she lurches into action again.<br />If you've read any of the League books then you'll already know what to expect: insane numbers of literary references, vast numbers of familiar faces in the background..it's all here. There's also an extended reference to the Harry Potter books that leads me to suspect Alan Moore's not a fan, but I knew that since \\"Trotter Minor\\" popped up in Smax.<br />The story ends wonderfully, as the Moon Child emerges, ready to \\"start killing everyone\\". And no, I won't tell you more.<br /><br />With Alan Moore's almost total withdrawal from comics, the League is the last opportunity we have of seeing him at work in this medium, and while I look forward to his novel Jerusalem as much as anyone, I am glad we have some comics by him as well.<br /><br />A strong ending to the Century story.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|I bought this product for my father who is 78 years old (deaf in one year and has lost 80% of his hearing in the other ear). When watching television he has to turn the volume up to full blast but after he started using this product the whole family could sit in the room and enjoy the show along with him. This product works great now I no longer have to yell at him when asking him a question. I would recomend this product to anyone. I have also purchased this product for my 98 year old grandmother.The only downside to this product is that my father does not like to use the over the head earphone so I also bought a separate set of ear buds.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|I love Meryl Streep and thought the idea of her playing Thatcher would be great. She did a good job but the film overall was so boring. It was like they were trying to be artsy or something and ruined the story. Thatcher's story is a part of history. If you want to do artsy try something like trainspotting or something. But don't use a historical story that is just annoying.  There was not enough character development for her children or husband or the people she worked with. I thought they could of done a better job delivering the story of Thatcher. It also seemed the film was a bit bias as well. Trying to paint her in a dark light. Instead of approaching it from an open-minded perspective. Example: The terrorist group the IRA. If you want to learn about them in an open minded way then you would choose a book written by someone who was not affected by the IRA. Someone who doesn't care which side wins. Just as Thatcher was not very much liked among certain groups there were groups who did like her. The film was just not well balanced or educational.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This video is supurb.  Sometimes when they re-make a dvd they mess it up.  It is like being at the MGM Grand...front row seats.  I have grown up watching and listening to the Bee Gees...this was a trip down teen and college kid lane.<br />Bought two...sent one to a friend...she and her husband totally enjoyed an evening at a concert.  A beautiful singing group, entertainers, and family.  Buy with confidence....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing game I play it daily ever day I cant wait to play it after work and school. su&ccedil;h a fun game
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to admit this type of book is not my normal read.  However once you read one of the sex scenes you can skip the rest if they make you uncomfortable.  I really like the characters, they way the grow, learn and actually need each other.  I've read all three books and i loved them.  Just give the first book a chance, you might find you like something different.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|Gameloft is a great company but there game are so expensive. when I buy a game for $7 I expect it to be great and that I won't be disappointed in it. Game loft shouldnmake free versions of there games that only let you play about 20% of the actual game so I buy a game and afterward say &quot; wow I just wasted 7 bucks on a game.&quot;
B003O86FMW|3.0|This second in the series is not as dynamic because she spends much space catching you up on details that were in the first book.  It gets redundant.  Where did she get the ideas for all the torture in the games?
B0063IH60K|1.0|Ads pop up, which I don't like. Don't get it, you'll just uninstall it later. I like solitaire &amp; how it was done for Android tho.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This app is a fun, relaxing waste of time. I like that there is a timer to beat and that you have unlimited shuffles. I thought the levels got harder too as you went on. This is a fun game that I've come back to again and again. It is worth the $0.99 to me.
0345803485|1.0|Started reading this book just to find out what all the fuss is about...after reading the fisrt chapter I was insanely bored had to abandon reading this book...high literature this book is not...this book is for people who lack imagination
0439796636|5.0|What a wonderful book!!!!!!  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  It was so interesting reading through the eyes of the horse.  I would recommend this book to everyone, especially if you love horses.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I saw \\"The Avengers\\" on opening night. I went in kind of with an open mind because though the trailers excited me, I just didn't want to be disappointed and I surely wasn't. The way Joss Whedon built the story behind each character and then put it all together was amazing. Acting was on point, Action sequences were phenomenal and the story was pretty good too sticking to the comic, it did however feel like a Thor 2. When I say I couldn't wait, I HAD to download this movie to watch it again before its September release. Perfect movie for the WHOLE family to enjoy. Can't wait to see it in Blu-ray.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it wouldn't download on my kindle fire and now it wont come out of.my notifacation bar ughh annoying but I looked at the pictures and it look soo fun too bad it wont work :/
B001EBWITA|5.0|I'm a long time comics reader, who started following John Constantine back when Alan Moore created him in the pages of Swamp Thing.  I read his excellent Vertigo series and enjoyed it. I acknowledge that this movie strays pretty far from the original character.  He should be played by Sting, or someone who looks and sounds like him, for instance. I know that as a comics fan, and a fan of horror movies in general, I'm supposed to be appalled by its very existence.<br /><br />However.  All that being said - I love this movie for lots of reasons.<br /><br />First off: Keaneau is no Brando or even Depp.  Never will be.  But this is my favorite performance of his career by far.<br />Second: the story is excellent, delineated by some clever and engaging dialog.<br />Third: every supporting actor in this is excellent, especially Tilda Swinton and Peter Stormare.<br />Fourth: Peter Stormare is the best Satan ever committed to film.<br />Fifth: The direction is excellent, with fine pacing, and a good, cohesive look that's neither dull nor overly-flashy.<br />Sixth: Fine effects, with particularly well-realized \\"hell\\" sequences.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about seeing this film, let me help push you over - I think this is truly one of the best comic-book adaptations, and one of the best action/horror movies ever made.  It's far better than a lot of people give it credit for, in my opinion, and the very least it deserves is one watching.  I think you may be won over, as I was. Let me know if you were!
B0088TG252|4.0|avoided the movie for a while based on lukewarm reviews...but really enjoyed the movie.  Actors turned in solid performances.  Fun movie.

B004BCT2HU|5.0|if you're a fan of David Garrett as i've recently become, then you're gonna love this dvd. and those fans of his who don't own Rock Symphonies must add it to their collection. i first bought the Legacy dvd. it was terrific. i enjoy this one even more. he crosses many genres effortlessly. a master of his craft, starting when he was only 4-years-old. when you see him play his strad violin it's obvious he loves what he's doing for himself and for his audience. and he's a wonderfully humbled person as well. his parents and teachers are so very proud of him, as they should be. even the behind-the-scenes footage is not to be missed. my dearest friend in the whole world talked a little about David and his musical talent and suggested i give him a try. so glad she did... and i did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really good game. I also like how you get bonus points for trying extra hard (like 5 times in a row).
0060853972|5.0|The fact that I found this book completely by chance amazes me. It was a halfhearted decision, I just wanted to be able to tell my teachers next year that I read something other than FanFiction! Now, I've read a ton of books in my 15 years on this planet but I must say that Good Omens is certainly up there in the top 5. Normally I can't stand it when authors try to be witty and make lame jokes but Mr. Gaiman and Mr. Pratchett managed to do in in a way that didn't completely turn me off from the book. I just quite simply adored it. The plot is engaging, the characters are PERFECTION and I'm proud to say that I found myself laughing just as much as I cried while I worked my way through this. If you're still on the fence about buying it, take a chance. Even if you don't love Good Omens you'll get to tell people you read a cult classic! ;)<br />Read on<br />-Elizabeth

0345803485|3.0|I have finished reading the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy and here's my take on it.<br />When I first started reading it, all I could think of was how I was reading Twilight. There are tons of similarities between the two books, which I know has been pointed out by other reviewers; but, just let me mention a few similarities. First of all Anastasia is a clutz. She literally trips into Christian's office and he has to be the hero in helping her up to her feet. She has a ditzy mom who is unable to take care of herself. The man Ana calls dad fishes and is a man of few words. Christian just needs a set of fangs with which to tell Ana how bad he is for her. Instead he welds a twitchy palm that wants to spank the dear Ana for not following his extensive list of rules. There is also another beau who would love to be more to Ana than just her friend. Ana of course says no to Jose telling him the age old line of how they are like brother and sister but nothing more. Poor boy!<br />It's quite hilarious because with all the lip biting Ana does it makes the reader almost bite her own knowing that it will get her a gift (an expensive gift) from the rich and powerful Christian.<br />The book continues along with a lot of repetitiveness that either makes the reader say, \\"How cute!\\" or \\"Yuck!\\"<br />There have been so many people who have focused on how UNChristian this book is and I believe it a bit ironic that the main character's name is Christian. Let me pause for a minute in laughter. I can't help myself! LOL!! This book is not near as kinky as lots of people want us to think it is. As Christian points out to Ana their sex life is pretty darn vanilla with just a sprinkling of spankings, hair pullings, being tied up a bit, and only one other set of balls. Hehe!! There's a small fraction of time spent on describing some of the more flavorful bits and pieces within the Red Room of Pain, but very little of it is actually used in the novel.  I'm sure there were many of us who were deeply disappointed with this. We had wanted to read some naughtiness, but of course there's not a whole lot of it here.  This novel is more like a Twilight with a little sex thrown into the mix.<br />I was discussing this book with a group of ladies at the book store and we all said that no man in the world could be as good as Christian at giving gifts and taking care of his woman in the way that he did. We all agreed that we could definitely put up with a few spankings for the power and riches Christian bestowed on his woman. It's a fair book, good for a frivilous first read; but, I don't think we will be rereading it anytime soon.

B004T5K3OK|3.0|Loved this app until recently.  Worked superbly, very handy for making passable scans of docs, until my Galaxy SII got the ICS upgrade.  Then, like others have noted, scans result in blank documents.  I am certain that the dev has fixed this on newer version, but Amazon Appstore does not have newer version (months after its release on Play!)<br />This critique is on the Amazon Appstore.  If you truly want Android users to think first of Amazon, they have to trust you.  A daily free game of marginal quality does not win me over from Google Play.  Better would be counting on reliable updates, and occasional sale prices on quality apps.
B004SUDPXW|1.0|First off, I love this show. I don't watch it when it airs so that I can buy the Blu-ray for each season and watch like that-- commercial free in high def. The one star is for the Blu-ray itself and the lack of ability to bookmark the disc. This is a huge inconvenience for the user. You have to start all over if you can't watch an episode fully. The technology is such that with Blu-ray you can turn the machine back on and the disc will load up and ask you if you would like to start from where you left off-- a huge benefit of the format. For whatever reason the producers of this set decided that the user would have to watch the Blu-ray the way that is most inconvenient to the user. Pisses me off every time I go to watch the Blu-ray. Now, this may only apply to my particular Blu-ray player, I don't know if another brand can bookmark the discs so take that into account. I do know that my player can bookmark other Blu-rays though.<br />..<br />  July 29, 2012--  EDIT: I just recieved BB season four and the ability to resume where you left off has been added to that set.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy!  In order to form an accurate opinion, readers should complete the set!  Books two and three fill in a lot of details.  Granted, it is not for everyone, but open minded folks will find it a great read!  Great job E L James!
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean's Channel Orange is an stunningly fresh R&B album. Ocean is an extremely talented singer and rapper (he doesn't rap much in this album, though) and this album just proves it; he's simply an amazing songwriter. His vocals are hypnotizing and his lyrics are deep. My favorite tracks are \\"Thinkin' Bout You\\", \\"Sweet Life\\", \\"Super Rich Kids\\" (w/ a standout verse from Earl), \\"Pilot Jones\\", 'Crack Rock\\", \\"Pyramids\\" (very refreshing and almost surreal), \\"Lost\\" and \\"Pink Matter\\" (w/ another standout verse from Andre 30000). Overall the whole album is amazing, listen to any of these tracks and you'll be amazed. It also has amazing and versatile production that compliments his vocals.<br /><br />Buy this album because it's great, not because of the \\"hype\\". This album will be played for a long time and it's the perfect summer album. I highly recommend it for fans of music in general.

B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This kit is a lot of fun.  With this cutter, as opposed to the Ephram's Cutter that lays flat, you are able to do bottles that are much smaller.  For separating the glass I used hot and cold water.  Some people have used a candle and ice.  Be patient and play with it until you find what works best for you.  I stress BE PATIENT.  Biggest complaint it that it can be difficult to figure out your hand placement to ensure a good grip and constant motion.
0345803507|3.0|I never received the book due to an address mix up. It was more expensive to have the book resent to me than it was to just restock it and get a refund so that's what I did. I then bought it on my phone and thoroughly enjoyed the book! It was greatly written!
0345803507|1.0|ARE YOU KIDDING ME<br /><br />This load of literary garbage is about as disconnected from reality as it gets.  First of all no DOM is going to apologize for his behavior to his prospective SUB, and further more what self respecting women would allow this kind of obsessive/complusive behavior!  Women of the world, if you are thinking for one moment that you are going to find your Christian Grey out there now that you have read the book, trust me when I tell you your experience is going to be more like Leila's and not Anatasia's.  The author fills up soo.. much space with the touching, grazing, groping, slickering, and general all around bopping each other that one wonders if this is just filler for an unimaginative mind.  If on the other hand this represents some form of alter-ego, voyeur'istically experiencing what she secretly desires, well then I can understand.  Although if the latter is the case maybe \\"DARLING\\", or DAHLING in her world, you should just tell Hubby to break out the toys!!  Anyway, save your money and find a real author who can write an engaging piece you can sink yourself into.  What Mush!

1781161097|5.0|Wow, what a book!  I was waiting with such anticipation for the release of Ridley Scott's feature and when I saw it - I wanted to see more.  I'm a big fan of behind- the- scenes books and Prometheus: The Art of the Film delivers.  From its 192 pages of illustrations, storyboards, and set photos (all of which are in color), fans of the movie will have a clearer idea of what it takes to produce such feature.  For anyone who is a fan of Ridley Scott, this is a must have book!

B0087YYHZU|5.0|First off, I need to point out that Amazon does have this odd policy of grouping ALL reviews of  ALL versions and editions of a film in one place. So when a film is restored or reissued the reviews are grouped with the others. There are over400 reviews for \\"Singing in the Rain\\" here and they stretch back as far as 1998 and as recent as July 2012. Reviews are automatically sorted by the \\"Most Helpful\\" first and - while I hope you will find my review helpful - I do encourage you to look at the date of any review you read and compare it with the \\"release date\\" of the edition you are looking to purchase. With that said, I'll move on to my review.<br /><br />I'll go along nearly everyone who treasures \\"Singin in the Rain\\" in saying it is probably one of the most important films ever made and the top musical. It's also the most entertaining 103 minutes you'll se on the screen. Sure there is smart dialogue, but the film boasts a compendium of wonderful \\"hit songs\\" that were all succeses even before the were incorporated in the story by Comden & Green. Go ahead and read the other reviews, if you are not familier with the plot or background of the film. That hasn't changed in the 20+ years of reviews.<br /><br />I last reviewed this film on DVD 10 years ago when Warner Home Video released the 50th anniversary package in 2002. That was before Blu-ray. Because the multi-disc versions of the new 60th Anniversary Edition contain all the \\"special features\\" of the 50th Anniversary one, I chose the single-disc Bluray to see the new HD transfer and the new 53-minute documentary. The single-disc BD contains only the HD transfer, the doc, a \\"juke-box\\" function and the Theatrical Trailer (along with the commentary track from the 50th).<br /><br />The PRINT is glorious even on my non HD TV. And the film was not in Wide Screen so the dimensions of your screen don't matter. The documentary really didn't add much, but was fun to watch. Its purpose was to reach the younger generation who are fans of \\"Glee\\" and \\"High School Musical\\". Both choreographers and actors from those shows are interviewed and tell about the first time they saw the film. A few \\"oldsters\\" like Rob Marshall and Baz Luhrman add comments and there are some from film historian Rudy Behlmer (who appeared on the Warner musical reissues before the start of the press-on-demand Warner Archive series). Of course there are lots of clips from the film (some repeated again and again) as well as clips from other Kelly films as well as Fred Astaire films - comparing the two. A brief mention of importance of Arthur Freed is made but no discussion of the new digital transfer. It's an OK doc but, not sure it breaks any new ground.<br /><br />Still, if you love this film (and I can watch it over and over) and have an HD TV, you'll probably want to pick this up. If you have the prior edition and an HD TV you'll want the single disc BD. If you don't own the prior one, you'll want the 2-disc version for all the extra bonus that were added 10 years ago.<br /><br />But this is a DVD (in one form or another) that EVERYONE should own.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"e fans of \\"Glee\\" and \\"High School Musical\\".

0451450523|5.0|I saw the animated movie The Last Unicorn when I was younger. What I remember most about the movie was its sense of beauty mixed with melancholy. Fortunately, the movie follows the book very closely. Peter Beagle's book is rightly a classic. It doesn't ever really try to convince you to buy into its fantasy world, the way Tolkien's Lord of the Rings epic builds Middle-Earth. It doesn't provide rich detail or an epic plot. The Last Unicorn does build a sense of magic and has a wonderful way of stimulating your emotions.<br /><br />The beauty of the descriptions, the sadness of the situations is almost too much to bear. Beagle knows what the reader expects, but he doesn't give it to you. And it is those twists that make the story special. It's really hard to give specific examples without spoiling key parts of the story, so I won't try. I'll just say that things that should be magical are imbued with sadness, and things that are sad are imbued with magic.<br /><br />Aside from the unicorn, the main characters aren't a particularly heroic lot. I'd actually call them pathetic at first glance. Beagle doesn't write the characters with an eye to realism. Yet, at the same time, they feel real because of their flaws and because of their loyalty. Again, it's the contradiction of characters who are pathetic but noble.<br /><br />Overall, if you come into The Last Unicorn expecting a fantasy epic like Lord of the Rings, you'll be disappointed. Rather, if you read it as an emotional journey, and let the story take you where it goes, you'll find a unique book.<br /><br />A note on the audiobook: Peter S. Beagle reads the audiobook himself. This gives the book a different and interesting flavor. Beagle's voice sounds like a New Yorker's so the story comes across more like a tale being told by an uncle or grandfather (think the narrator in the \\"The Princess Bride\\"). It's definitely a neat way to experience the story, but I'd recommend reading the book first.<br /><br />Some versions of the printed book (the deluxe version) have a noveletta by Beagle called \\"Two Hearts\\" that acts as a sequel to The Last Unicorn. I wasn't sure what to expect given that it came out almost 40 years (!) after the original novel. However, it is well worth the read. The story follows a little girl who seeks King Lir's help in slaying a griffin. We see some familiar characters and the aftermath of King Lir's rule. Unlike the novel, it's told from a first-person point of view. However, as with the original book, the real impact of the noveletta is in how it stretches your emotions. If anything, I think the writing is even sharper and more poignant than in the novel. There's the mixture of beauty and melancholy again. I've included a link to the noveletta in the comments section.<br /><br />To be honest, I cried when I finished reading the story, and it was the first time I've had that response to a book or movie.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Video Games, Born to die songs are the best of all. Amazing music, I am a rap music fan but when i heard this album i am kind of considering listening more from this genre.
B005J4ASDG|4.0|The LOTR symphony isn't as rich as the LOTR movie soundtrack. The range of the music isn't quite as wide or evocative as the original soundtrack. I wouldn't recommend buying this just as a cheap way to get the LOTR score. If you like Howard Shore's LOTR soundtrack, dish out the money for the original soundtrack.<br /><br />This symphony does have a role though. The original soundtrack is, of course, a movie soundtrack. Some of the movie tracks fit the movie well but don't make for light listening (particularly the Orcs' themes). I've tried studying with the movie soundtrack on, but sometimes some of the tracks are just too overpowering and distract me. The symphony score by contrast is perfect for relaxed listening. You can have it on in the background when you study or work. As such, for the price, it's a nice way to enjoy the LOTR soundtrack in a different setting.

B0063IH60K|3.0|I'm not an unreasonable person. I have no issue with a free game showing ads to keep the lights on. That said, this is one of those times when I wish I could actually set my preferences to get at least targeted ads. I don't want ads for \\"sexy singles\\" popping up every three deals. I'm not playing Solitaire because I'm lonely and looking for a man!  I'm playing because I'm need a time-killer for ten minutes. Maybe an \\"is this ad relevant to you\\" prompt so that the game can provide more targeted ads that won't have unseemly implications?<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if there was a bit more customization. You don't have a lot of options insofar as the card design. The card images are pretty generic. Graphically, it looks like the solitaire game that use to come standard on computers in the early 1990's. With all the advances in graphics available, maybe something a little less retro?<br /><br />Overall, I like solitaire and the app works. But it could be tweeked to make it better.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Out of nowhere, Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" has quickly climbed its way up the NY Times bestseller list. Personally, I discovered this novel through Amazon.com, while browsing one thing or another. The reviews were great and it sounded like a good read, so I drove down to the local bookstore and picked it up, because I wanted it in hardcover.<br /><br />I wanted a good, quality hardcover read. I almost got that.<br /><br />Gone Girl is about a man named Nick who returns home one day to find that his wife, Amy, has disappeared. She's gone. The living room is a mess, the door is wide open, and there is absolutely no telling sign of where Amy went. There are many characters to be found in Nick's search for his wife, from his endearing twin sister to his sleaze-ball lawyer to the good cop that needs to be bad given the situation.<br /><br />Interwoven between chapters in the present are Amy's diary entries, which reveal the nature of her and Nick's relationship.<br /><br />This is a simple plot that essentially banks off the fact that Nick knows nothing about his wife's disappearance and, thusly, neither does the audience. This isn't a \\"whodunit\\" type deal, with a bunch of suspects and a checklist of who could have done it and who couldn't have. This is more like \\"how could this have possibly been done!?\\" For the most part, Gillian Flynn gives the reader enough information to keep them guessing and satisfied, but occasionally, even patient readers will be frustrated with sly tricks and \\"quick cuts\\" at the end of chapters for suspense.<br /><br />There are a few eye-roll inducing moments at the beginning of the book where Nick will have a long conversation, and then at the end of the conversation, right after the last line, he'll say something like \\"That was my fifth lie of the day\\" or \\" But that wasn't true.\\" Because the reader knows virtually nothing at this point in the story, I find this a cruel trick on the author's part to add confusion where there need not be. Its a pet peeve of mine when characters in first person (i.e. internal monologue/stream-of-consciousness) somehow manage to hide their thoughts and emotions from the reader. What... did Nick just forget he was lying until the end of the conversation?<br /><br />Aside from that tiny, nit-picky gripe, the writing in this book is good. Refreshingly good, actually. Gillian Flynn is insanely talented at crafting sentences that pinpoint exact emotions in between the large, key-holed classics like \\"angry\\", \\"sad\\", and \\"love at first sight.\\"<br /><br />On Page 30 of my copy (First Edition, Hardcover), Amy's diary is remarking upon meeting her husband Nick, after a long time. This is before their real relationship starts:<br />\\"And then you run into Nick Dunne on Seventh Avenue as you're buying diced cantaloupe, and pow, you are known, you are recognized, the both of you... You just know each other. All of the sudden you see *reading in bed* and *waffles on Sunday* and *laughing at nothing* and *his mouth on yours*.\\"<br />The entire book is written with that clear quality. Absolutely stunning.<br /><br />But even the prettiest writing in the world can't save this novel from the one thing that I can't forgive: it's extremity. When Part 2 starts, I was instantly disappointed. Not only had I predicted that that was something that would happen, but I had actually ruled it out because it was too ridiculous.  And then, reveal after reveal, the ante keeps getting upped from a starting point that I never fully latched onto.  It never becomes ultra-campy, but it does become  a bit too similar to the melodramatic noir novels that the book itself references. Maybe that was the intention. But Flynn's job, as a writer, is to make me buy into her scenario. She failed to do that.<br /><br />Granted, Flynn did an excellent job with what she had. Because, the more I think about what happened, the more ridiculous it seems. But while I was reading it, it was only *just* out of the realm of realism, so I was still able to enjoy my reading and get through the novel.<br /><br />The build in this book is insane. Literally, the suspense and plotting will keep you reading. But there isn't really a big bang moment. Like, I remember reading [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]], and my insides lurching in white anxiety when Leigh Teabing confronts Robert Langdon in the back rooms of Westminster Abbey. I wanted the pure, unbridled thrill of confrontation like that. In my opinion, this novel does not have that.<br /><br />But this novel has a lot of pretty writing, and it pulls you through a deep, well developed story that will immerse even the most reluctant readers. I recommend this to most readers, but with a warning: it's not *quite* the book of the year the back cover makes it out to be.

I am glad I bought the book because it has so much more detail about the science behind the eating and great, easy to understand analogies for how your body is reacting to the food you eat.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the Meal Template. I've been eating this way for half a year and the recipes on blogs can get tiring if you get lazy and into a routine of making the same go-to meals every week. But the meal template is perfect for breaking out of the funk!! Sometimes you have a fridge full of veggies and don't know what combinations would be good and how to appropriately spice them or prepare them but the meal template makes everything clear. I'm especially excited to try out the sauces because you don't find Whole30 approved BBQ sauce every day!<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone looking to make a positive change in your health. It will reduce your stress, promote healing, and ultimately change your outlook on food.<br /><br />You CAN kick your cravings and regain and repair your health, and It Starts With Food!

1400049628|5.0|I don't think there is going to be a zombie attack but if there was one, this book is very valuable knowledge to have.  It's also, whether intentional or not, packed with really great survival information for emergency situations.  The book is written to be serious in a fun way and is an easy read for young and old.  If you're into zombies you'll LOVE this book.  If you're not into zombies you should read it to see what all the fuss is about :-)  Max Brooks did a really good job putting this together and found a way to expose people who would otherwise not be likely to learn about first aid other disaster preparedness techniques.  Good read for sure.

B00000AOUD|5.0|A masterpiece of rock and roll progressive or otherwise. Ian Anderson is a musical genius and he was trying to show us that, while saying he wasn't showing us that. It was taking a chance in 1972 for a commercial rock and roll band, based in the blues to put out an album with ONE song. How did it work? It was number one and is still considered a classic rock masterpiece.<br /><br />What makes an album progressive? Besides the reasons usually stated like telling a story, or taking chances with sound or musical styles, the main thing is can the band play their instruments. Answer: These guys sure can. This is the best lineup that Ian ever had and every musician on this album is top notch. Martin Barre one of the best guitarist of the rock era, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond on bass, John Evan on the keys and the incomparable Barriemore Barlow on the drums. A great band indeed.<br /><br />The lyrics are imaginative and every time I hear them something different stands out. The song really does split into 2 parts, in the old days side 1 and side 2. Side 2 is much more musical than side 1 and John Evan really stands out with great Hammond organ. Martin Barre is excellent throughout and Ian vocals are wonderful as well as his flute playing and acoustic guitar work. Barlow is one of the most underrated drummers and he really adds to the rocking sound of this album.<br /><br />5 stars all day long and one of the top 10 albums of all time. Take a trip back to 1972 and enjoy the lyrical and musical adventure that is Thick as a Brick.
B003Y3MYYU|5.0|This new Decca boxed edition of Böhm's Ring means you can now buy all four operas in Wagner's epic for the price that used to be charged for Die Walküre alone. When you take into account sonics, casting, conducting and orchestral  playing there is no better Ring. The Bayreuth acoustic is captured magnificently and there are no weak links in the cast. This makes a perfect first Ring, certainly far preferable to the [[ASIN:B0000042H4 Solti Ring]] which is the standard recommendation. No libretto is included so pick up Andrew Porter's classic translation of [[ASIN:0393008673 The Ring of the Nibelung]], with side by side German and English text,  and you're all set. For more reviews of this set see these reviews of earlier editions: [[ASIN:B000025ESY Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen [Box Set]]] and [[ASIN:B0000040YY Wagner: Der Ring des Nibelungen, WWV 86a-d (1966- 1967)]]. There are about forty additional reviews in all. The packaging is different but the content and remastering are the same.

B007WULJ5G|5.0|i picked up this uncut gem after watching a bootleg version(it was uncut as well) and deciding that, to me, it is the most brutal underground gore film since slaughtered vomit dolls.<br /><br />i usually am a harsh critic on horror films and i must say, i dont have one single bad thing to say about this movie. it had a great, original plot, it was not a remake, it had a soundtrack that went well with the feel of the film, over the top gore and just brutal in general scenes, multiple twists near the ending, and touched on topics that are deemed taboo by even the most jaded gore hounds.<br /><br />i dont want to give away too much, for the first time watching this without really knowing whats around the corner is priceless. but one of the main topics that caused all the controversy had already been done in the last in the vomit gore trilogy called, slow torture puke chamber(which i had already watched). so, i went into watching this movie, not focused on the very few scenes that closed minded viewers couldnt handle, but i was able to absorb this film for what it is. which to me is just a great exploitation movie. i felt that all the scenes that caused up roars all over were completely justified by the film's brutal story. i dont think the director did these scenes on purpose or to shock rock us, or to get his film talked about. i think this director just had a wonderfully, over the top story and wasnt about to compromise his vision just for people that feel that its immoral. if you have issues with the subjects dealt with in a serbian film(which most of you will), just dont watch it. stick to friday the 13th's and such.<br /><br />for the gore hounds, and fans that enjoy degrading,filthy,perverted, sleaze cinema, watch this at all costs(avoid the cut version). the idea to cut this film on just a few scenes is ridiculous. any one that can handle the cut version, can handle the extra few mins. for those that have watched this, i have 3 words for you,<br /><br />bravo! bravo! bravo!ravo! bravo!
B00873GRU4|5.0|I am so tired of seeing great ideas and exciting plots destroyed by poor writing and underdeveloped characters. At last- a story that is crafted with skill and suspense.  Hugh Howey can spin a gripping yarn beautifully. I loved the words and carefully constructed sentences that invite the reader to enter the lives of believable characters in an impossible world  made believable as the plot unfolds. His descriptions of relationships : Holsten and the ghost of Allison, Jahn and the Deputy, Juliette, Lukas and Solo connect the reader in words that deserve remembering- savour the words that tell the story- a fantastic read!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Alright so as an author of [[ASIN:B008B10J1K Possessions (The Possessions Saga)]] I can honestly say every book needs a little juicy tidbit. A part that's a little risky and raunchy. This book though is all the tidbits pulled together to make a book, it has it all. From whips chains and dark rooms of submission. This book was recommended to me by well, tv, radio and my best friend. My best friend and her mom went out and both bought a copy from the store. When they finished this book her mom was in love with it, and my friend hated it. They had a big argument about it and so of course what do I want to do? I wanna figure out whats going on myself. So I asked to borrow the book. I read the first chapter and this book was honestly not my cup of tea. I think the story is well written but I also think there could have been more of a story line to it. I know its an erotica, but other then the be submissive to me while I send subliminal messages to you, it really didn't feel like there was a lot of story behind the actual book. It was just one hot sexy scene after the other. Don't get me wrong well that is great. I couldn't help but wish there was more there. All in all a great book. I would recommend it but not to anyone under the age of 20. :)
0345803485|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read in my life and I have read thousands.<br />Don't waste your money on this piece of crap. It is unrealistic, boring, mundane, and totally out of whack.
B008GANNIC|4.0|I've been trying a number of new bands lately, and P.O.D. is the latest on the list.  When I downloaded Murdered Love, I found that I had grabbed \\"Shine With Me\\" when it was a free song on Amazon a few years ago.  While I liked that song, I never followed up on it - until now.  I also checked them out on All Music, and I found this quote \\"They're born again Christians, and their faith takes a central place in their music.\\"  Now I was intrigued even more...<br /><br />So, what's my take on Murdered Love?  It's somewhat mixed.  I thought that it started strong with \\"Eyez\\" - a heavy song that is a call to repentance before Judgment Day.  It's a heavy sound for a heavy message.  \\"Murdered Love\\" is also a good faith based song with a grinding sound.  I'm digging the things so far.<br /><br />However, from there to the end of the CD I found a couple of problems that cost this album one star on my rating.  The first is musical.  Songs like \\"Higher\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" don't stand up to or fit with the overall sound of the album.  The chorus on \\"Higher\\" sounds like bad Nickelback (not that there is really good Nickelback, but that is a story for another time).  This is pure opinion, but I just don't like \\"Beautiful\\".  It is too soft compared to \\"Eyez\\" and other heavy songs.  The only slower song that works in my opinion is \\"Bad Boy\\" with its Ska sound.  Otherwise, the musical diversity on Murdered Love works pretty well.<br /><br />The other issue I have is with the closing song \\"I Am\\".  I think that P.O.D. has the best of intentions with this song.  They try to give the perspective of people who see themselves as the worst of the worst.  Perhaps they will even reach some people with it, but I believe that they crossed a line with the lyrics \\"But I know this is the one and only Son of God, so tell me who the **** is he?\\"  While the offensive word is censored on the song, I just don't think it has any place in music that has the purpose of making a statement of faith.  I also think that there is an opportunity for confusion from the lyrics.  While it is certainly true that there are many who think that they are too bad to be saved, I was troubled that they never answer the question \\"Cuz if you knew who I am, would you really want to die for me?\\"  The answer is absolutely yes, but P.O.D. let the question hang.<br /><br />In the end, I applaud P.O.D. for their intent and overall positive statements of faith.  The reason I am so hard on them about \\"I Am\\" is that they set themselves up to be held to a higher standard.  A confusing confession of faith is worse than something that is clearly immoral or wrong.  I also think they should stick to what they do best and keep the songs heavy.  There are some really good songs on this album.  Enjoy with caution.<br /><br />Download this:  Eyezink that there is an opportunity for confusion from the lyrics.

B0080GUX2Q|3.0|This book is very readable and in places even quite illuminating, but it really should have been a lot better than it is. The strap-line looks promising `Happiness for People who Can't Stand Positive Thinking'. Well, positive thinking is naff in more cases than not, so it looked like a book for me. However I was having difficulty with the general approach after just a few pages, because happiness and positive thinking are totally different things, and I don't believe the author has done a very good job of linking them. This is from p6 -`There are good reasons to believe that the whole notion of \\"seeking happiness\\" is flawed to begin with. For one thing, who says happiness is a valid goal in the first place?' Excellent. The Gadarene Swine, says Malcolm Muggeridge, were doubtless in pursuit of happiness when they leapt to destruction over the cliff. Bernard Shaw goes even further and calls happiness itself, never mind its pursuit, intolerable.<br /><br />Alas, Oliver Burkeman seems to be another in pursuit of happiness after all, with occasional sideswipes at the positive thinking brigade and a sustained chapter (rather better, this) in which he pans the fashionable cult of goals and goal-setting very effectively. The good reasons for scepticism about seeking happiness seem to have disappeared without trace: all he is concerned to attack is the ways in which others think they can attain it. He quotes with approval a patronising statement by the garrulous monk Thomas Merton to the effect that what many people never understand is that the more you try to avoid suffering the more you suffer. How far such a lofty statement can be supported as a generalisation I don't know, and I'm quite sure Merton doesn't either. However quite a lot of this book concerns itself with similar propositions, so frequent that I found myself wondering whether Burkeman is really keeping his focus on what he thinks his topic is. Is it pursuit of happiness, or avoidance of unhappiness? Once again, those are not identical issues - even Shaw admitted that unhappiness was more intolerable than his despised happiness. Avoidance of the one does not entail or even connote a quest for the other.<br /><br />Asking for a definition of happiness is asking for trouble, but Burkeman ought to have made some attempt to indicate how the ordinary speaker of English, unencumbered with Aristotle, eudaimonia and the rest of it, is likely to understand the notion. Provisionally, and only for present purposes, I'll try something akin to `contentment', although `happiness' is probably stronger in flavour. At least `contentment' will do as a makeshift antonym for `unhappiness', which `happiness' won't, and if I am misrepresenting what Burkeman thinks that's his own fault for not settling the matter himself. If he is seeking happiness, then we at least have an idea what he may be seeking. He seeks it through a cut-price tour of Great Philosophies and Cultures, somewhat in the manner of the 70's when Brits were seeing the world more than before and the Guardian among other bien-pensant organs used to run a lot of material of this kind. It's largely about toughening oneself against the slings and arrows of an outrageous fortune, but there is also an excursus about the `self' which is rather interesting, although I think he can't have read the right books on the matter. Paraded for us are (chiefly) Descartes and Hume, concluding with H's famous statement that in searching for the self he could only find a bundle of perceptions, not any `self' that could stand individually as distinct from the bundle he is talking about. Fair enough: there was never a more rigorous logical thinker in human history, I dare say, than David Hume. However, what did he think he was looking for? The school of linguistic philosophers mainly associated with Oxford may or may not still be unfashionable, but they had the technique for dealing with this sort of issue. Looking for the `self' in the way Hume was doing was never going to find it, because it was not there to be found in the same category as the components of his bundle. It's  Ryle's `category mistake', explained in The Concept of Mind. Ryle passes quickly over this instance without disrespecting the great Hume, but he flags the point.<br /><br />I could frankly have done without western cultural tourism to Nairobi, Mexico and wherever, to see how the deprived deal with their expectations. I doubt that most of us need telling that once poverty is relieved people find lesser issues to be dissatisfied with; and the parallel that wealth does not bring happiness is, dare I say, news that men have heard before.  Burkeman's epilogue is a lot better than much of what went before it, because his intrinsic sensitivity and intelligence is allowed to come through. I hope I need not even say that he does not offer any formula for attaining happiness in the way his quoted motivational speaker has a recipe for success in the first couple of pages (before his forum went bankrupt). We're back to what I started with - that was about success, not happiness, and Burkeman could have handled this dichotomy a lot better. Nor does he offer anything so ridiculous as an alternative philosophy of pessimism or negative thinking: these are correctives, not general rules. To illustrate what I mean, I am not myself any wholesale admirer of Winston Churchill, but if ever there was, in any history that I know, a triumph of positive thinking and seemingly irrational determination, it was what Churchill provided in 1940. The thing exists, just don't cheapen it with motivational speaking and such like. To end on a positive note, Burkeman is right about `survivor bias' in sampling, which proves the desired case via selective instances. As for coping with death's inevitability, just imagine living for ever and you will have no problem with that, or maybe not until the moment is on top of you.oing was never going to find it, because it was not there to be found in the same category as the components of his bundle.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've been looking for a good calculator for my Fire, and have gone through several trying to find the perfect one.  I think the perfect calculator is a very personal thing, depending mostly on what one does with a calculator.  I just want to be able to do basic stuff, the few times I need to do more than I can do in my head (like splitting restaurant bills when I've had a glass of wine).<br /><br />Well, I think I found my keeper in Calculator Plus Free (Kindle Fire Edition)<br /><br />It's attractive, bright, has full screen keys and an easy to read results display.<br /><br />You can copy your result by pressing and holding on the main part of the results display (or paste a number into the app by the same method).<br /><br />To calculate a tip, enter the item cost, then + the per cent and tap =.  37 + 25%<br />The result, 46.25 will show in the top of the display and the breakdown 37 + 9.25 will be shown below.  Easy peasy for entering into credit card charge slips.<br /><br />It has a memory \\"tape\\" where you can see past calculations--tap on the lower part of the results display.  You can clear the history or just close the tape after viewing.  A tape is one of \\"must haves.\\"<br /><br />There's also a paid version [[ASIN:B007EC27QM Calculator Plus (Kindle Fire Edition)]] for $0.99 which removes the ads.  The ads are very unobtrusive, in a narrow band at the top, but if that bothers you, $0.99 for this very nice calculator is not too much.  I thought about buying the ad-free version just to support the company, I like it that much, but instead opted to buy the [[ASIN:B007TKT2SK Fraction Calculator (Kindle Fire Edition)]] by the same company.

B0079R8IYW|5.0|I use my Kindle Fire every day, and take it with me most places that I go. While I knew the Fire was a rugged little tablet that could stand up to most things, I still wanted to have a little extra protection to keep things in the best condition for as long as possible. I'm a cyclist and will throw this in my bag when I'm headed to work or class along with various other objects that are not always Fire friendly. This has really helped in keeping my screen scratch free, and dents and dings out of the body.<br /><br />The case is easy to use; there is only one way you can put the Fire in, so it is a breeze to set up. The Fire is securely tucked in the case and has never come loose. The Fire is easily removed, as well, so no worries about it getting stuck in there or being hard to access if you need to clean it. The front 'door' of the case has a small magnet to help keep it closed when not in use, and again, even in a backpack bouncing around with other things, it has not come open.<br /><br />I was a little skeptic of the credit card slots and the little pocket on the 'door'. I didn't think I would use them, but I ended up keeping a prepaid card in there, mostly for use when I'm at work and want to go out for lunch. The little pocket is great to keep a little note stuck in to remind yourself of something later or tuck a couple dollars in for the vending machines at campus.<br /><br />All around, this is an amazing product. It has held up well to my use / abuse and has very little damage to show for it. The screen tends to get more build-up in the corners, but a paper towel with a few drops of alcohol on it will take care of it with no issues. The case wipes off easily and doesn't make the Fire too heavy to read in bed with or sit around and hold for long periods of time. Love this! Could not imagine my Fire without it!

She is an average writer with a very sexually charged imagination and has just secured the financial position of herself and her family on a below average book. The power of the media. Most people are reading this book due to curiosity and hype. Beyond disappointing. It's drivel. 50 shades is written with no real story line and absolutely no ending. It just stops.. So you have to buy the next book. No sort of conclusion whatsoeverever. If you want sex education then yes you will get something from this book.. Otherwise save your money!!

0812993292|4.0|\\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" by Rachel Joyce, is just as delightful as the hype indicates, but it's also more moving that I expected. Harold says he's \\"an ordinary chap, passing by\\" as he decides to walk hundreds of miles to see an old friend, Queenie Hennessy, who is dying of cancer. Magical thinking has him convinced that by walking to her he will save her life. But Harold is so much more than ordinary. Of course the journey changes him; as Harold becomes \\"moved and humbled\\" by the many people he meets on his pilgrimage, so do WE become moved and humbled, reminded as we are that everyone carries some sort of burden with them.<br /><br />\\"He understood that in walking to atone for the mistakes he had made, it was also his journey to accept the strangeness of others.\\" It is our journey in this novel as well. As Harold remembers, relives and rues much of his past, so does Maureen, the staid and somewhat bitter wife he has left behind. Her internal journey is almost as interesting as Harold's external one is.<br /><br />There are a couple of intriguing mysteries that unravel as Harold walks. What happened with Queenie and why did she disappear 20 years ago? And what is the deal with Harold and Maureen's son David?<br /><br />I must note that the presmise that living is always better than dying bothered me a bit. By urging Queenie to \\"wait\\", didn't Harold just prolong her suffering? Isn't death, sometimes, a relief to be embraced rather than fought against? But this is a quibble because the story isn't really about what happens to Queenie but about what transformations Harold and Maureen experience and embrace. I believe other reaaders will be as touched and satisfied as I was by this sweet, but deep, story.

0439023491|3.0|Forgive my ignorance but isn't this just a re-telling of Hunger Games?<br /><br />Book 2 of The Hunger Games Trilogy finds Katniss at the raw end of the President's stick. The Capital wants to end whatever goodwill Katniss and her partner, Peeta have created in the districts.<br /><br />In order to stop a possible uprising, The Capital decides to return all winners of the hunger games back for a rematch. Katniss and Peeta are back at it only this time they are fighting the heroes.<br /><br />While reading this and particularly the ending I kept thinking this book was primarily written as a place holder until the third book when it all hits the fan.<br /><br />The arena in which the games are played is different but the characters return to rehash the same places and scenarios as the previous book.<br /><br />So maybe you die hard fans can right my sails. What was I missing in this rehash of a sequel?

0307352145|5.0|I love this book. Cain has written a substantial tome on how we introverts have power in this world of gabbers.<br /><br />Broken down into four parts:<br /><br />The Extrovert Ideal explores the rise of the Cult of Personality and how that has seeped into the Evangelical sphere. You have to be loud and extremely outgoing in order to have a successful church or personality.<br /><br />Your Biology, Your Self? takes a look at nature/nurture and what role free will plays in all of this.<br /><br />Do All Cultures Have an Extrovert Ideal? Looks at other cultures - primarily the Asians and how they value listening instead of speaking.<br /><br />How to Love, How to Work discusses how to engage in this extroverted world; when introverts should try to be extroverted and how to hold conversations with \\"those people\\" who love the sound of their own voice.<br /><br />I enjoyed the very beginning of this book best as Cain described her time at a Tony Robbins self-help event and all the hoopla that goes along with this beast-of-a-man's personality. Then she segues to Rick Warren's church and provides insight into how the Evangelical world is banking on extroverts and how that actually harms the more introverted of people.<br /><br />In this age where personality seems to be more important than character, this is a terrific book that provides some insight and solutions for the quieter of the masses.<br /><br />This book was provided for review, at no cost, by Crown Publishing.
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|All the songs are great.  Definitely can get into it.  Anything with a Robinson name on it does not disappoint and this is no exception.  Thank you for another epic album...keep them coming!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game played very well on my HTC Thunderbolt, not very well on the Motorola Bionic- the screen kept jumping around &amp; would sometimes flicker the items, &amp; so far it is doing well on the Razr Maxx. I wish it would stop trying to connect to Facebook &amp; would actually stop the timer without telling it not to go there! Overall I like it a lot, especially that it is a variety of games in one.

1439170916|5.0|The subject of cancer really hits close to home with me.  This book defined many of the terms I've heard thrown around in relation to cancer... terms I had a vague inking of regarding their definitions like retrovirus, radical mastectomy, and carcinogen.<br />I read this book in big chunks, at times getting so upset and appalled by the serendipitous nature of scientific discovery that I would close it (well, close my kindle) insisting I would take a break and not read any more.  I couldn't stop myself from going back to it.  I read the whole thing in 5 days.<br />It is my hope that some young person(s) will read this book and get on fire for finding treatments for the many faces of cancer.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I assume that these Amazon apps are developed, or at least authorized by Amazon.  If so, this app appears to be just a shameless method of increasing sales by decreasing the mobile customers' search and filter options.  Far, far less functional and discerning than the full site and you get the feeling you're being duped while you're using it. Will be deleting as soon as I'm done writing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was very good. One thing that annoyed me, was the repetition of things happening over and over in the book. The ending to this book and series was excellent though. It had some boring parts, but the ending was great. The epilogue was a big help too. Hoping if Suzanne Collins does more books, they'll be as good or even better than The Hunger Games series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is one my core applications.  I use it for everything.  I have eliminated the need for a whole bunch of notes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is challenging and very addictive.  It's hard to put down.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and have not had any problems.
B002UBRFDC|4.0|Shogun is an epic tale of western culture clashing with eastern culture around the 16th century. And when I say epic, I mean it. I guess I've read books this long before (I've read George Martin's series a few times now), but something about the story of Shogun makes it feel longer. I guess it could be that there is little action.<br /><br />In a book about Samurai going to war there is very little war. I'd say there's a nice number of one chop beheadings to even things out though.<br /><br />I loved this book. And I hated it. It is infuriatingly boring while at the same time being impossible to put down. I don't know how Clavell does it, how he keeps you interested in his story--except for the simple fact that the characters are so much more than meets the eye. When you first meet the Samurai they are very unlikeable--and there are a couple who you just hate early on, but then somehow as this 1,000 page plus monster unfolds, you begin to really like these characters and care where they are going.<br /><br />There are hundreds of reviews on this book already--I'm going to keep mine short. If you're picking this up as an entry into this time period in Japanese history, then this is a great book. I am already starting on a number of other texts that revolve around this time period, and a book like Shogun really helps you to understand the framework of the rich culture.<br /><br />If you're looking for Samurai and adventures, maybe look elsewhere. This book is more thoughtful than action packed, more of a love story than a Samurai Showdown.
B006YMLE7G|3.0|The art in this anime was very good. The storyline was somewhat interesting, however, I would have appreciated more information about the world/universe this was set in. We're thrown into this realm where dogmen and creatures race these cars, but I have no idea how far into the future we are. Are these mutants or aliens? Maybe that's not as important to others, but I feel that it would have been interesting to know the history.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci does an excellent job in capturing the reader's attention almost immediately.  The chacters have meat, the dialogue substance and the subsequent images conjured up in the reader's mind almost real.  Momentum builds throughout the book.  It ends too fast as you can't put it down in my view.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|This has simply got to be one of the best shows I've ever seen. What shall I praise first? The breathtaking cinematography, tastefully chosen settings, choice of literary and dramatic devices, hugely multidimensional characters or fantastic story arcs?  This is one helluva awesome show you'll be proud to own and lend to friends who you know will return it :-)<br /><br />I also really fell in love with the script. Kudos to Benioff and co. Sure they must have spent huge amounts of time rewriting the lines to get them just right for the characters that needed to say 'em. I wrote down the below that I thought were particularly well delivered.  Perhaps I should get HBO - but then I'd have to watch the episodes as they come out and wait between them. Sadly, I don't have that kind of deferment. That's why the DVD set was the perfect buy for me.<br /><br />King Robert:<br /><br />Mine was some Tarly boy at the battle of Summerhall.<br />My horse took an arrow so I was on foot,<br />Slogging through the mud.<br />He came running at me, this dumb high born lad,<br />Thinking he could end the rebellion<br />With a single swing of his sword.<br />I knocked him with a hammer.<br />Gods, I was strong then.<br />Caved in his breastplate.<br />Probably shattered every rib he had.<br />Stood over him, hammer in the air.<br />Right before I brought it down he shouted, \\"Wait! Wait.\\"<br />They never tell you how they all shit themselves.<br />They don't put that part in the songs.<br />Stupid boy.<br />Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.<br />He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys,<br />And today his wife would be making him miserable,<br />His sons would be ingrates,<br />And he'd be waking three times in a night to piss into a bowl.<br /><br />- JK
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I agree with the other positive reviews here.  I will refrain from repeating what has already been said here in the reviews.  To add I will say that I e-mailed the author with a few questions and he replied back with detailed answers the same day. Also, please note that at the end of the book is a link to a free PDF you can download from his site. I highly recommend it, there is a lit of good info in it. I like that his information is unbiased. After reading the book once I went through it again and took several pages of notes. It is truly packed full of info and great value. I also purchased his \\"[[ASIN:147514377X Muscle Myths: 50 Health & Fitness Mistakes You Didn't Know You Were Making]]\\" which was very good too!
B005LAIH54|2.0|I must say I was extremely disappointed with the is movie, it was, at best B grade and poorly acted with a wishy washy story line, no more Titan sequels for me!
0345528581|1.0|I'm probably part of the wrong audience for this book, but having trained solely bodyweight for not even 2 years I can do things that are for elites or aren't even mentioned in this book, exercises like strict muscle ups, full lay back levers, L-sit, dragon flags and so on...<br />The book doesn't even come close to what bodyweight training means, just watch an hannibal or bar-barians video to get amazed. If you have to train like a bodybuilder using a backpack instead of a dumbell, just do yourself a favour and stick with your gym membership to get access to proper dumbells. All he cares about is looking good at the mirror, train to muscle failure or talking about spec-op, if that's your goal go for any bodybuilding program you can find around, weights are way more time efficient than bodyweight for muscle hypertrophy, no question about it. At very least download a crossfit bodyweight WODs list and train like a spec-op for free if endurance is your focus, but keep clear in mind that you won't build any above average strength with this book.<br />If your serious about your strength training just read [[ASIN:0980011140 Olympic Weightlifting for Sports]] or [[ASIN:0982522738 Starting Strength, 3rd edition]] if you like weights, [[ASIN:1467933120 Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength]] if you're committed to real bodyweight skills and [[ASIN:B002KDOLK0 Never Gymless : An Excuse-free System for Total Fitness]] if you want an underground, mostly bodyweight, strength & conditioning resource.<br />This free article alone \\"The Fundamentals of Bodyweight Strength Training\\" by Steven Low is hundreds of times more enlightening than this useless book. You can easily find it on the web, check it out for yourself.<br />I've already wasted 2 days reading this book, far too much away from useful knowledge.<br />Alberto Giuliani
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a really great game to help me relax on a boring raining day. its really good for my kids when they want to learn a new game..
B007JRU2UK|4.0|I hadn't heard much about this George Clooney movie, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was so enjoyable.  I like movies that have an interesting storyline that does not include violence and The Descendents fit the bill. I would not have liked paying $10. at the movie theatre for this one, but renting it on a Saturday night at home was perfect. Give it a try.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game its not the exact same as the original Oregon trail but still good! its very addicitve because you don't have to wait long for things to grow/build so you can play for hours. totally recommend this and also the MIB3 game too its pretty much the same thing!

B007KOYEOC|5.0|I didn't read this book my mrs bought it. I'll say this about it, it did make my sex life better. Good thing or bad thing I haven't worked it out yet but I didn't see my girlfriend for three day. Only to see her running down the hall to go to the toilet and then grab a pack of biscuits then bad to the bed room. It must be a good book because she read it about three weeks ago and I'm  still getting compared to the guy in the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|Before I got temple run,  I thought it was just a boring game where you run as long as you can. When I got it,  I found out there was so much more. There is coins, upgrades, powerups, and characters. I am personally a huge fan of upgrade games. I highly recommend this.
B00498XRPE|5.0|Rented and watched it before we went and saw Prometheus! It was great and good to watch b4 seeing that movie. I had never seen the original but Prometheus followed a similar plot line and there were a few other similarities. Everyone should see this at least once!

B000UD08HW|4.0|It should probably go without saying that the performance as well as song selection on this set is amazing. The audio quality is actually quite good as well...it's up to par with what you would expect from a Blu Ray.<br /><br />The only real fault this set has is the picture. It's just not nearly what you would expect from a Blu Ray...extremely grainy and odd looking in some parts. It seems that the crew doing the filming did not expect the lighting situation they were presented with. When the stage is flooded with blue lights, the picture quality is spot on. The rest of the time, however, it sort of looks like you are watching a low quality YouTube version blown up in HD.<br /><br />Even though it has its faults, I would still recommend this to any DG or PF fan. As others have mentioned, seeing Rick's performance here is worth the cost of admission. Here's to hoping that David has at least one more album left in him!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss tells a good story.  Despite feeling a little rushed, it was a great read.  I felt very connected to the story and found some scenes to be nail bitingly tense.
1466401885|4.0|I really liked this book.  I would agree that the violence and how easily Travis flew off the handle got to be a bit much, but I sacrificed sleep for two days to finish the book.  I always know it's a good one when I go back through to read my favorite parts, and I've found myself doing that the last few days.  $2.99 for the Kindle version was a steal; I would have paid more and been happy.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The overall structure of the story is fantastic, the characters are compelling and Rothfuss knows how to tell a story.
B0018LMKIK|5.0|Best for the money with a sound that makes the \\"Chronicle\\" CD's ancient at best and antediluvian at worst. Someone once said Johnny and CCR never let you down.  Indeed.  The \\"Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time\\" lists four from CCR. Hey, they only missed 20 others.  What are you going to do? Now to the CD:<br /><br />Cut 2:  \\"Born On The Bayou\\".  The remastering pays off with Stu Cook's bass guitar sounding better than ever.<br /><br />Cut 4:  \\"Travelin Band\\".  If not the greatest CCR song it's right at the top.<br /><br />Cut 9:  \\"Fortunate Son\\".  Again the enhanced sound makes the difference.<br /><br />Cut 11: \\"Run Through The Jungle\\".  One of John's best songs.<br /><br />Cut 23: \\"The Midnight Special\\".  CCR's rendition of this nugget can't be surpassed.<br /><br />Those songs stand out as do \\"Hey Tonight\\", \\"Molina\\" and \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\". However, there's really not a weak cut.<br /><br />JUST A GREAT CD.

B0001KU93C|3.0|I don't know why this movie is so highly acclaimed in the world of Spaghetti Westerns ... it had it's moments,  but was overall a little flat. My father fell alseep within the first half hour of the film. Franco Nero is clearly an Eastwood look alike but delivers his lines with indifference. I like the concept and some of the story but I could do without the prostitues fighting in the mud and there was too much repetitious talk.<br />I feel this is one movie that would benefit from a flashback of DJango's life before - even minimally - it might have added depth to this indifferent character.<br />Also they never did resolve what happened to Maria - I assume she died.<br />The directing wasn't very interesting and i would hardly say this is one of the best non Leone Westerns - Death Rides a Horse is much much better.<br />While,  I like Franco Nero,  I am hoping his story is fleshed out more in the sequels. His line delivery was just awful.<br />I'm sorry i bought this dvd at the recommendation of the reviews posted here and from The Spaghetti Western Database and some books I read. Maybe I missed something and need to watch it again... I dunno,  something was missing.<br />I,however did like the ending and that last shot was beautifully framed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I decided to buy this book I kept looking for a review that would tell me if I would like this book despite not being a fan of science-fiction.  I never found one but I bought it anyway and now I want to let you in on something... this book is not just for sci-fi lovers!<br /><br />Personally this was one of the most engrossing stories I've read in a long time.  I was up every night cursing it because I had to work the next morning and I couldn't put it down!  I'm a mystery lover and this book is definitely that.  I would say it's the best book I've read since Steig Larsson's \\"The Girl,\\" series or Ken Follet's \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" I'm the type that loves Michael Connelly, Greg Iles, Nelson DeMille, George R.R. Martin and Alan Folsom.  I now have to add Hugh Howey to that list.<br /><br />Wool has all the elements of a great mystery, love story and study of human nature.  It fires along at a rapid pace and will keep you reading passionately right until the end.  I believe Hugh Howey will become a household name and I recommend you get on the bandwagon now.  \\"Wool,\\" sets up well for sequels and I wouldn't be surprised to see it turned into a cinematic franchise; or better yet, an HBO multi-season series. It's Mad Max, 12 Monkeys and Mystic River all meeting in 550 pages of classic fiction!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, be the first of your friends to read this book!

0141197307|5.0|While the tale is the same as all other volumes of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the illustrations by Yayoi Kusama make it unusual and more beautiful than can be imagined. I actually purchased two copies; one for myself and one for my 5 year-old granddaughter. These illustrations are complete works of art, in themselves, by a very talented, creative, imaginative and, sadly, aged Japanese artist. This book will be cherished for generations to come.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I pre-ordered this album and planned on writing a review, which was put off over and over again.  After reading reviews, I thought a one-year review would be good.  I read a lot of what I consider \\"knee-jerk\\" reaction to the album, so, after one year and plenty of time to listen to it, here is my take on Fly from Here.  Whatever your favorite album is by Yes (mine being Going for the One), this is the best one since then.  Nothing I have heard over the last year comes close to the enjoyment I get from this album and I hope that anyone who gives it some time will discover the same thing.  I have listened to this album more in the last year than anything else I own.<br />  On first listen, i did have some hesitation at times as to how good it was, that's where a bit of patient listening paid off.  The quality and creativity of the music comes though over time, even with Jon and Rick not being involved.  Benoit does a wonderful job bringing his own sound to the band, and the three part harmonies sound as good as they ever were.  Geoff is a great keyboard player, as were all the others, and it may be because he used his classic keyboards that this album sounds so great to me.  I thought Magnification was great, but it is the keyboards that really make the difference in the total sound.  There seem to be others who know the origins of the Horn/Downes tracks better than I, so I refer you to them.  From a lyrical standpoint, I really like this album because it seems more focused on interesting word pictures and not so much of the cerebral-introspective and socital examination that was much more heavy in the last handful of albums.<br />  As for the songs, here's my take on them:<br />  All of suite Fly from Here is more like a collection of songs that were tied together with short instrumental pieces and some common lyrics, but still stand well on there own.<br />  FFH:Overture  It grabs your attention and feels like the classic days of Yes<br />  FFH: We Can Fly  I neverheard this when it was played on the Drama tour, but it was well worth the wait.  Nice driving bass, original guitar work, unlike anything I hear anyone doing these days, and the keyboards are just the right tones to fill it out nicely.<br />  FFH: Sad Night at the Airfield  Very nice acoustic work at the beginning with just the right keyboard accompaniment.  For a nearly 7:00 minute section, it goes by too quickly, especially the outstanding steel guitar work at the end.  Some of the finest in years.  I've only heard David Gilmour's work on High Hopes sound close to this.  Ominous and beautiful at the same time.<br />  FFH: Madman at the Screens  A return to the overture theme, this one is heavier and drives pretty good.  Has some great organ work near the end.<br />  FFH: Bumpy Ride  One of the parts that took me a bit off guard because it seems slightly out-of-place, but it grows on you over time and you get used to it.  It does have this somewhat happy feel to it.<br />  FFH: We Can Fly Reprise  Also a bit odd coming in, reminded me of the very end of Tull's Thick as a Brick, sort of like the radio was suddenly turned up and here's this piece of music.  Other than the odd intro, it closes down the whole piece nicely.<br />  The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be:  Feels like it was drawn a bit more from the acousticness of the 80's or early 90's.  A very nice example of allowing different instruments to have there own parts and not crowd each other.  The bass riff at the end is very nice and guitarists could learn a lot from Steve here.  You don't have to use loud distortion all the time, just use a few notes here and there to build what you want.<br />  Life on a Film Set:  This is the best example of word pictures on the album, not like we have heard since probably Tormato.  A nice acoustic guitar and keyboard mix on the first half, into a very upbeat second half.  The second half sounds very happy and fun, sort of like the very end of Sound Chaser and it's playfulness with the \\"la la la's\\" although there are no \\"la's\\" here.<br />  Hour of Need:  Sound wise the first thing I thought of was Wonderous Stories or Nine Voices because of the Portugese Guitar that leads.  Not heavy and very thought provoking.<br />  Solitaire:  Steve's guitar solo.  I feel like you are watching someone taking a walk though the countryside.  Music can create pictures in your mind.<br />  Into the Storm:  My one surprise was the lack of talk about this song.  This is the crown jewel of the album.  Nothing captures the feel of the 70's better than this one and it's been a awful long time since I've heard anything that musically brings me as much joy as this piece.  Chris has a bass sound most like what was used on Tormato, the guitar has just the right amount of bite to give the song drive, but not overwhelm anything else.  The keyboards accompany it perfectly and the drums tie it all up.  The other shock is the vocals, sounds just like the harmonies on Yours is No Disgrace.  The tempo changes are seamless, as good as anything I've heard in a long time.  Honestly, I can't do justice to how good this song is.  One of the greatest things is the musical outro.  It is the best musical closing they have done since Ritual, and it literally feels like you can see a plane flying off into a storm.<br />  The question is, if this is the last album by Yes, is it a worthy bookend to their career?  Absolutely!  I know the line-up may not be what everyone would have hoped for, but in the end it's the music that the fans of Yes truly care about, and here they have succeeded in making a musically satisfying album.  So, before you jump ship on buying this album because of some of the poor knee-jerk reviews, give it a try, give it several listens and decide.  In the end, I don't think you will be disappointed in what you hear.
B005NQ94KS|3.0|Fair warning, if you're having a bad day and you're just raring to settle down to a life-affirming romantic movie, for gosh's sake, don't pop this DVD in the player. Me, I haven't read the book this movie is based on, and so I did not see THAT coming.<br /><br />Sometimes, or even most times, you can't help with whom you fall in love, and apparently this also applies to British folks. Sometimes you start out as friends, perhaps because you're too timid to act upon your attraction. Sometimes, other things get in the way. ONE DAY presents a nifty gimmick. Over the course of two decades, the film tracks the same day - July 15th - in the lives of best friends Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess). On July 15, 1988, they graduate from the University of Edinburgh and meet for the first time and spend the night together just hanging out. Coincidentally, July 15th happens to be St. Swithin's Day, and I guess if you work at it hard enough, you can make certain connections between that tradition and what happens in this film.<br /><br />Em and Dexter are sort of polar opposites. Em, a blue-collar sort, makes do by dint of hard work and perseverance. Dex, spoiled and irresponsible and a charmer, hails from class and privelege. Em is an aspiring poet who's put her dreams on hold. Straight off university, we see her toiling away in a Tex-Mex restaurant in London even as Dex gallivants around the world chasing wine, women, and song and such. Still, Em and Dex check in on each other.<br /><br />Let's not mince words. Dexter is an asshat. Except that good fortune keeps smiling on Dex. Seemingly without putting the effort in, he gets a foothold in the entertainment industry, starting out as a television producer and parleying that into hosting his own late-night television show. It dawned on me that there's a parallel here to the fable of the Tortoise and the Hare. Dex's meteoric rise as a television personality is offset by his apocalyptic fall. It's particularly painful watching him on his show interviewing a crew of hip hop artists and catching a case of trying too hard. There's only one Ryan Seacrest - the Devil will honor no further deals. As for Dexter, his candle burnt out too soon. Not that I felt awful for him. To reiterate, dude's an asshat, possibly a wanker.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Em's prospects have steadily expanded. As Dex's star plummets, Em's rises and she begins living out her dreams. She becomes a thriving author of children's books. What we understand all along is that Em thru the years, during their periods of being close and being estranged, has been the rudder in Dexter's scattershot life. That's how the movie makes sense. I liked the plot device which had the narrative skipping ahead (sometimes for years) and catching us up with the characters always on July 15th. I liked that there's always something changed, that there's been progression. On one hand, you can't overlook the contrived feel of the plot device. On the other hand, it sweeps away all kinds of plot-related detritus. Each July 15th focuses on some relevant high or low point our leads are going thru. I did think that for most of the film, the story itself comes off predictable, the flirting, the wariness, the spats. That is, up until the shocking twist.<br /><br />If nothing else, I now know how to play the startlingly violent parlor game of \\"Are You There, Moriarty?\\" Not being a Brit, I couldn't tell if Anne Hathaway's English accent convinces. It sounded good to me, but then, when I was a kid, I thought all Brits talked like D!ck Van Dyke's chimney sweep from MARY POPPINS. But I thought Hathaway was marvelous. And if you gauge Sturgess' effectiveness by how much his character is disliked here, then he also submits a fine performance, because I was seriously hating on Dexter. Grudgingly, I admit that Sturgess does exude raffish charm. I thought ONE DAY had potential. I enjoyed the banter between Hathaway and Sturgess. I became invested in their willthey, won't they relationship, even though Dex is so hard to root for. But the third act effed me up, truly it did. Again, if you're looking for a dramatic love story to uplift you, stay far away from this one. ONE DAY is about as feel-good as a three-story face plant onto concrete.they, won't they relationship, even though Dex is so hard to root for. But the third act effed me up, truly it did.

0345803485|1.0|I purchased all 3 books; in all honesty, it did not take 3 books to tell this story.  In book 1 you are captivated because you are trying to understand the characters so you tolerate, the juvenile behavior, unbelievable conversations at the beginning of a totally over the top storyline, because you want to see how the author is going to bring everything together.  By book 2 you feel enough with BDSM, develop the characters, by the end of book 3 I kind of felt like, did I miss something?  There are so many potential storylines, character definition and development opportunities that are missed throughout the trilogy.  Had she spent less time on the BSDM and more time developing the characters the books really could have been great.  There are too many loose ends, 2 missing months of Grey's memory, foster brother obsession with his Father, Lela story was weak, why was Mia and Ethan even there? etc., etc., etc.  I will not find out how it ends because if there is a book 4 I will not be purchasing.

B005LAIGSC|3.0|I almost went to see Safe House in the theater, and barely resisted the urge to blind-buy the Blu-ray, and I'm glad that I waited. After borrowing the movie from a friend, I know that I saved myself $20.<br /><br />It's not that Safe House is terrible, it's just formulaic, mediocre, and badly-written.<br /><br />The basic story is built around Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who looks after a safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. The job involves a lot of sitting around, but he springs into action when he learns that Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington), a rogue CIA agent, has been captured, and will be delivered into his custody. When a recovery team, led by Agent Kiefer (Robert Patrick), is attacked and defeated, Weston is left to bring Frost in himself.<br /><br />Weston is ambitious and wants to work at a more high profile location, but he's young and unproven in the eyes of his bosses. We are shown how he is regarded during an exchange involving his superiors, Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) and Linklater (Vera Farmiga), at HQ.<br /><br />Imagine you were given the chance to write the screenplay. How would you make it stand out from previous entries in the genre? We have seen this subject handled well in the Bourne series, and reasonably well in Salt. Safe House doesn't belong in the same class.<br /><br />What's wrong with the movie? The excellent cast is virtually ignored. Instead of establishing the characters and giving them depth, we are given very little background information. The front cover promises an adrenaline rush, and that's all that we are given. If you love action movies and don't care about the plot, Safe House delivers. But if you want to know why these events are occurring, it's not exactly an important part of the mix. There's a lot of gunfire, but meaningful dialogue is at a minimum.<br /><br />If I had the pleasure of directing actors like Washington, Farmiga and Gleeson, I would make use of their abilities. Washington doesn't put a foot wrong, he's just given nothing to work with. Farmiga's screen time is extremely limited, but remember how effective she was in a similar role in The Departed? Gleeson is one of a kind and excelled in movies such as In Bruges and The Guard, but his character has no depth in Safe House. I see this as a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />In the Bourne movies, we see how Jason Bourne meets his girlfriend, and how that relationship becomes meaningful. When she is threatened, we feel his pain and we react. Weston's girlfriend in Safe House may as well have been a cardboard cutout, and as a result, we feel nothing when he examines their relationship.<br /><br />Safe House focuses on the action element. You'll see shootouts, car chases, explosions and people running. You might even understand why all this is happening, even though it's just a by-the-numbers screenplay. The movie grossed over $200 million and you won't scream for your money back, but I wouldn't bother buying the Blu-ray unless you are an action junkie. I love the cast, but against my expectations, I'm severely disappointed by the end result. Watch Bourne again instead, or watch Anton Corbijn's, The American, as that actually has some fresh ideas.t given nothing to work with.

B005DTEUAE|5.0|After Dave left, I was unsure of how the RHCP were going to find a guitarist that could fill his shoes. \\"I'm With You\\" is an excellent album in its own right, even without Frusciante. Josh Klinghoffer does an outstanding job of replacing the lead guitarist with a musicianship of his own. The sound on the vinyl edition of this album is far superior than the CD version; it is more clearer and has more warmth.

B0045XKJBI|2.0|I'm not going to say that this movie is terrible.  It's not.  And if you're a teenage girl (or think like one), you will likely like this movie.  But for people who like a movie with plot and character development, you're in for a long 90 minutes.<br /><br />First off, the characters are not believable.  Every time Edward says EXACTLY the right thing that Bella wants to hear, it just doesn't seem realistic.  Sorry, ladies, but no man is that perfect.<br /><br />The best way to look at this movie series is almost soap opera-ish.  It's all glamorous, over the top and just not very believable.  Don't get me wrong, I don't expect realism from fiction.  But I still expect well constructed characters with strengths and flaws.  That's really that main issue with Edward.  He's all strength and no flaw, which isn't believable and it isn't very fun.
B003K5ZQGU|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I love a period drama, but the fact that it's a historical story makes it that much more intersting for me.  Emily Blunt's performace was flawless and I really enjoyed the love story between her and Albert.  I never considered that there were any real love stories among royal marriages of that time period.<br /><br />But I found it hard to stay in the story with the sound being so glitchy like I was listening to it through ear buds with a damaged cord, except I wasn't listening through ear buds. I found that very, very annoying and very distracting.
014241493X|3.0|I never thought I would give John Green anything less than 4 stars, but I could not in good conscience give this book more than 3.  It was readable and some parts were enjoyable, but quite frankly I found myself skimming because I was bored.  I really did not like Margo - I thought she was very self centered and the fact that Quentin worked so hard to search for her pretty much boggled my mind.  I do think the concept of paper towns, which the title is named after, was pretty interesting.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|This movie was pretty enjoyable, so don't get me wrong when I mark this at only 3 stars...it isn't because the movie wasn't entertaining.  The reason I gave this only 3 stars was for a few simple reasons:  Firstly, the special effects in this movie, particularly during bits of the ghostrider scenes, were a little hokey...I think they could have used a little more work.  Secondly, although the motorcycle in this 2nd movie is probably more accurate to the comics, I don't think they should have changed it up.  Sure, the motorcycle in the first movie was a made up creation that didn't quite resemble the motorcycle from the comics...but it was bad@$$, and when something's brought to the movies they change things all the time anyway, and often they're pretty cool changes, though sometimes not...but that motorcycle in the first movie was awesome!  Thirdly, I hate to say it, I think a lot of the acting was lacking a bit, even on Sir Nicolas Cage's part.  Don't get me wrong, he did ok through a lot of the movie, but as much as I love the actor, there were parts of the movie that his acting was not that great, and some of the supporting cast's acting was only \\"okay\\" at best.  However, I would have to say that the awesome Idris Elba's performance was sensational...probably the best in the whole movie.  I expected that though, because he's awesome in Prometheus, Takers, and The Losers.  All that being said, the movie was still enjoyable, and I'd probably eventually buy the movie at a used price...but it wasn't quite as good as it could have been.  With the technology they have now a days, you would think they could have done this a little more justice, but oh well.  It's still worth at least a watch.
0553386794|4.0|I am not usually a fantasy-genre fan (with the exception of Harry Potter of course).  But having watched the first season of HBO's adaptation of Game of Thrones, I figured, why not give this book a try?  Well, I am glad I did!  Although the show follows pretty closely to the storyline, I still really liked the experience of reading the story.  I felt that I know the main characters now more personally due to the author's excellent character development.  True to other people's critique that there a few likeable characters, but I find that it makes it a bit more realistic.  In the battle of a throne, who is going to be straightforward, honest, and truly altruistic?  Just look at our own American politicians now!  But I digress... if you are looking for an adventure with betrayal, romance, war, family issues, and hints of magic, try this book!<br />4 1/2 stars.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of 24 and have collected all 8 seasons of these excited action pack videos.  These videos will have you glued in position because you just can't walk away from 24, neither do you want to put it on pause.  The excitement in what will happen next will always have you focused.  Love it, love it, love it......I can't wait for the movie.

The movie gave us more info on the characters and the plot!<br />2. Some under-foot characters got extra time in this version!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. Elektra had a more violent death than in the<br />theatrical version!<br /><br />If you liked the theatrical version, or were okay with it, you might like this<br />version better! It's worth the price, go buy it!<br />My grade B+ or four stars!
B0082KPF32|5.0|Everything that I love about progressive death metal is in this album. Harsh vocals, clean vocals which for me sound a bit like Devin Townsend, hooky riffs, great drumming and then you add in a violin which FITS IN! The songs are all memorable. If you love Opeth or Barren Earth, check this album out. You can't beat the price!
B001GJ3BPU|4.0|First we had X-men in 2000; a pretty good start!<br />Then we had Spider-Man in 2002; even better!<br />Now in 2003; we have Daredevil to start with...<br />What I liked about the movie:<br />1. It was dark and brooding!<br />2. Ben Affleck nailed it as Matt Murdock/Daredevil!<br />3. Jennifer Garner electrified as Elektra!<br />4. The under foot actors were pretty good with their parts!<br />5. There was a lot of action going on through out the movie!<br />6. I loved the raid in the biker bar!<br />7. Matt Murdock was a more realistic super hero than Peter Parker!<br />8. The soundtrack rocked!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. Micheal Clarke Duncan had to much corny dialogue!<br />2. Bulls-Eye was too clownish of a villain!<br />3. Did Elektra really have to die so soon?<br />4. The movie was a little too violent for it's PG-13 rating!<br /><br />This movie was seriously under-rated! I though with a few touch-ups it could have been better,<br />but I think it should have gotten a little more credit than it did!<br />My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!

The battle in the bathroom between Arnold and Kristanna was epic!<br />14. I loved the scene in the food market (\\"Talk to the hand!\\")!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. They screwed up the time line a bit; In Terminator 2:<br />Judgement Day, it was established that John Connor was<br />ten-years-old, but in this movie they said he was thirteen<br />when the second movie took place!<br />2. they could have had some better punch-lines for Arnold!<br /><br />Overall, this was a very welcome edition to the Terminator universe!<br />Highly recommended to anyone who is an Arnold fan, action flick lover,<br />or a fan of the Terminator universe!<br />My grade B+ or four stars!
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Fantastic flick. While I would say NO don't let the kids in on the phone u and your better half will enjoy it. ESPECIALLY the unedited non rated version. Jim finally beats the \\"apple crumb cake\\" stunt from the original Apple Pie in 1999.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I bought this movie because Octavia Spencer was in it & also because it looked good. The rich women of the south think that they are the only ones who rate. And the servents are way below them. One very nice young white woman is on the side of the help so she ask them to tell her what is really going on because she is writing a book to tell the truth.

B004DK5CW4|4.0|When I got this DVD as a present, I was not thrilled.  The initial press reviews I read were tepid or downright scathing.  As a long time horse owner and rider (and generally horse crazy person) but not a fan of horse racing, I was familiar with the story of Secretariat and remember watching the live coverage of his Triple Crown races at the time, so my expectations for this DVD were low.  To my surprise, I found myself getting fairly swept along by the movie and really enjoyed the pace and treatment of the horse racing action, and the characterization of the various main players.  Diane Lane gave a fine performance while John Malkovich was brilliant and funny.<br /><br />I agree with some of the criticism:  even overlooking the many liberties they took with the real events, the movie is really all about Penny Chenery and her determination to see this special foal run and prove himself.  She had many obstacles to overcome but too much is made of her \\"housewife\\" state, after all she was born and raised on a training farm.<br /><br />Secretariat was truly a super-horse (his heart was twice the size of that of an average horse and some of his records still stand after 37 years) but neither his physical and mental gifts nor his unmatched dominance of the sport were sufficiently conveyed.  Instead, his remarkable string of victories is presented more like a vaguely mystical journey with religious overtones.  In fact, the coverage of the Belmont race is the weakest moment in the whole film, ludicrously interrupted by gospel music and shoddily re-enacted on a much smaller racecourse.  It would have been much better to show the actual footage of the race which still stands as one of the greatest moments in any sport.  Finally, the hippy daughter fabrication further detracted from the action, making Secretariat himself too much of a bit player.<br /><br />Despite all of the above, my family enjoyed this movie so much that we have already watched it a second time and I suspect it will get further airings from time to time.t it will get further airings from time to time.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|[[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5)]]<br />I bought this book (kindle edition) because I read the previous 4 books and I wanted to find out how the story progresses. Given all the loose ends, I suspect the author will publish several more books before he will deem necessary to present us with the conclusion of this epic soap opera. Overall, I found this book less enjoyable than the previous ones. At times the pace of the narrative slows to a crawl and the author seems to take a questionable pleasure in his detailed glorification of total human degradation.  Some of the characters tend to become increasingly inconsistent (for example, Jamie Lannister seems to discover some latent sense of honor), the Ironmen appear increasingly like a time dislocated version of the Viking raiders and Braavos looks like a mixture of Venice and the ancient Greek port of Rhodes where the Colossus straddling its entrance has now become a gigantic statue named after deities of the Greek mythology (i.e. the Titans).  I missed the part where Greek mythology was taught in the Free Cities but I keep wandering why the author went through the trouble of creating such imaginative new geography (obviously the planet this story takes place is not our good old Earth) but kept the same moon (which scientists tell us is an anomaly in our solar system).  However, I will not question the ability of the Wall to stand for thousands of years in the same place and not becoming a moving glacier, (especially when it goes up and down hills) because I know the answer: it is the embedded magic.  Finally I was disappointed with the change of the very likable and assertive character of Daenerys into a woman who thinks more with what she has between her legs than between her ears.
B000NV6E7E|5.0|Having read nearly all of Mary Stewart's opus (except for the children's books), I would rank this particular story among my top five favourites.  The title refers to the classical dressage movements performed by the famous Lipizzaner stallions at the Spanish Riding School in Vienna.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of Mary Stewart's books is her thorough research.  I am particularly well qualified to say that, in this novel, the equestrian theme is impeccably and satisfyingly accurate and Lady Stewart's passion for horses really shines through.<br /><br />The story opens on the tragic aftermath of a fire and follows a troupe of circus performers travelling through the Austrian countryside and, here again, Stewart's descriptions are a delight, and the reader is transported into a world so vividly drawn that it is difficult to imagine its modern counterpart.  The other usual elements of Mary Stewart's writing are all here:  intelligent narrative, a gripping plot with many twists and turns, superbly drawn characters and more than a dash of humour.  One of the pivotal scenes toward the end of the book is pure comedy, coming on the heels of a rather robust Bond-style chase.<br /><br />If you have read and enjoyed other Stewart novels, this is one of the best.  For those who are new to her work, it would be a very good place to start.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book is extremely enthralling right from the beginning. I loved that it was written from the perspective of a child, it's a really interesting change from the way most novels are written.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|I loved the first 3 books.  I saw all the 3 star reviews for this book and just couldn't bring myself to believe that the 4th book would be any different than 1-3 so I bought it.<br /><br />Big mistake.  Look at the last page of the book - the author has a couple pages where he apologizes for not even mentioning a half dozen of the major characters from the first 3 books!<br /><br />I was so engrossed in the first 3 books that I read all three in 10 days.  It took me over 3 weeks to get through this book, and that was by following my \\"step 2\\" recommendation below...<br /><br />I was already drowning in the 1000's of people the author lists throughout the first 3 books but had gotten into a good routine of ignoring all new names unless they appeared / were mentioned 2x or more.  That saved me time and again.  That approach doesn't work in this book because the author introduces new 'major' characters in the Point of View/chapter sections that are just awful.<br /><br />I have 2 pieces of advice -<br /><br />1) Don't buy this book because it will taint your overall experience with the story.  Don't worry - this book does *nothing* regarding developing the major characters from the 1st book with 1 exception - Jaime.  He seems to have turned over a new leaf.  Other than that, its either all about new characters or just provides dull and mostly pointless descriptions of the other characters.  You will not have a positive feeling when you're done reading this.<br /><br />2) If you are going to buy this, then try skipping completely all POV chapters that don't have an actual persons name & instead have a description like \\"The Captain of the Guards\\" or \\"The Kraken's Daughter\\".  If you get to the end of the book and enjoyed it then go back and read these chapters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm done with this series.  The reviews for the next book are even worse than for this one.  Guess I'll watch it on HBO - one of the few times that the 'movie' HAS to be better than the books...assuming they even go past the 3rd book<br /><br />Blech!oks...assuming they even go past the 3rd book<br /><br />Blech!

B005LAIHGI|5.0|Sasha Baron Cohen's new incarnation is a near perfect example of political satire. This would probably be surprising to read some of the other reviews to this movie. Some have called it \\"offensive\\" others have called it not believable, others have decried the character itself. For this movie, this is not the point. The plot makes numerous references to current events throughout the movie. The Dictator character himself is a composite of Ghadafy and Saddam Housain. The Dictator's country is modeled on Lybia. The references to current events are really too numerous to mention, and if mentioned, would spoil their discovery. When this reviewer saw the movie at the theater, and when one of these political references were made, the reviewer laughed but the other patrons were not. They did not get the joke. The jokes are there nonetheless; you just have to find them.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Everything that I was looking for in a weather app! Simple to use, accurate and visually appealing. I highly recommend this app!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is a movie I was too curious about to let the critics keep me from giving it a chance on DVD. Boy, am I glad I did. The story is excellent, and follows the original Edgar Rice Burroughs books very well. It is a complicated story with lots of unusual vocabulary (Barsoom = Mars, etc.), but if critics had exercised half a brain cell, or if the Disney marketers had done their jobs, we might have had a box office titan on our hands rather than a movie being run down as a flop. Because the movie is good! It has the substance, style, and story of a great adventure tale; it's wonderfully realized in every detail; and the story keeps twisting and turning until the end, all very coherently.<br /><br />Critics have become very unreliable lately. There are few I trust, and too many scoring systems give stupid blog critic as much weight as reliable real critic. And then we get the dogpile effect of the lazy critics, who read other critics and don't think for themselves. This all added up to a critical problem for \\"John Carter,\\" but an undeserved one. This is better storytelling than \\"The Amazing Spider-Man,\\" and better effects, just for example.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, read a little of the original books, then watch the movie. I think you'll be glad you did.
B007ZCZK4W|4.0|I checked out this album after seeing the band on 'Letterman', and was pleased to note consistency (but not repitition) throughout. Carefully crafted ambient pieces with shimmering melodies and great vocals illuminate thoughtful lyrics.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|There isn't much more I can say about this performance and I don't want to repeat what others have written.  I did want to make people aware that there is a bootleg version of this recording in existence, but with fewer tracks.  The bootleg states that it is a performance from April, not August.  That is wrong.  You can tell it's the same performance as this release because they pay tribute to King Curtis, who was murdered in August.  Beware...
B00005RHGL|5.0|First off let me say the directors cut is a vast improvement over the theatrical cut. It explains more and you get a greater depth to the story. Also George Cosmatos DID NOT direct this film. Kurt Russell in an interview with TRUE WEST magazine after Cosmatos' death said the the agreement with him was that Russell would give him a list of shots for the next day and communicate with hand signals. No if's and's or but's about it. Russell said Stallone did the same thing with Cosmatos on RAMBO II. That being said, there is still more footage that could be included in a futrue cut, but Russell says he doesn't have the time or energy to go through it. Too bad.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I like a lot of the Sherlock Holmes Stories, though not all of them. Sometimes the pace is too slow and the solution to the mystery so clearly out of reach; other stories are studies in humanity, suspense, humor and detail.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The offensives ads pop up and the only way you can get them off is to get out of the game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this game. Makes solitaire seem boring. I just wish there was the option to change suit from all black to all red.  I haven't tried the two suit + selection yet.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It says I can make it pin code but idk how. Can someone inform me? Itsnot a bad game. Very time consuming so far
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Would be a fun, simple game, if it fit on the screen correctly. Droid Bionic, right column is 90% off the side of the screen. Needs a screen size adjustment/scaling option.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game doesnt work on my Droid 4.  The right-most column is cut off and none of the puzzles can be completed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a great way to exercise your brain. there are easy puzzles if your not really looking for a mental workout and just want something to keep busy. there are also some really tricky ones when your up for a challenge. very nice game and free! no annoying ad pop ups!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but this is easily one of the best groups I've heard in a very long time.  They do things with their voices that bands can't do with their instruments...
B004EPZ06G|2.0|Sophmoric humor part 2. Will appeal to men in the under 35 age. Way TOO MUCH use of the \\"F\\" word. I bought this product with the Bridesmaids, and Hangover.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I was using a pair of Alessandro MS-1's hooked into my Sony Walkman 16gb and thought the sound was unbelievable, until I got a Hifiman HM601 slim and hooked up a pair of these cans (after doing some research). Let me say, OMG!!! With a freq. range of 15 to 25 kHz, and for the $ (a big issue), why would you pay more for a better headphone. The sound on these no matter what you may listen to from Classical to Rock A to Z you will not find (if you can find them, they are discontinued) is out of this world. I highly recommend these if not the newer version K240 MKii's. If you really want to spend the $$ get the Quincy Jones series Q701's for $250 to 300 usd. You will not be disappointed I promise you, unless you have the hearing of a dog, you will hear everything the original recording artist wanted you to hear. As one reviewer said \\"you will learn to hate your speakers after hearing these.\\" I have a HTR with Polk Audio TSi200's ect. and let me just say I find myself listening to the AKG's more often than the Polk's. These Headphones come highly recommended not just from me (a newbie in the world of highend headphones and sound) but from others, just do some research for yourself, you will not bet disappointed.
B0086700CM|4.0|but I plateau at 2000 meters. its like its rigged or something. but I still have a lot of fun even my 4 year old can play
0671027344|1.0|After reading this book and expecting a huge surprise at the end I was disappointed to find out that the book was very predictable.  I found myself getting very invested in the main character, Charlie, just to find out basically nothing at the end.  At least it was a quick read.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Of all the weather apps I've tried, this one has to be the best!<br />I had everything you typically want to know without clutter or too much information. It's well broken down and gives exactly what most people want to know and see. Radar, temperature, forecast, alerts and a few more things.<br />I highly recommend it.<br />It also doesn't annoy you like some do.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Book is interesting but not finished with it. From what I read so far, I know I will buy the next novel in the series.
0547569653|5.0|A must read for everyone, not just runners!!! A truly inspiring story. This book will make you want to run, eat and live better.
0345803485|1.0|I was excited to get this book and read it because of all the rave reviews.  However, I found myself unable to get through the book (not due to content) but due to the fact that this was sucha a BASIC writing style.  I mean that in the style, in the words, in the sexual terms, and in the character development. I agree with another reviewer that this was written on the level of \\"middle school\\"  Just because you have a fantasy (which we all do) doesn't mean it should be published.  I feel like I lost IQ points reading the quarter of the book that I did.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is really fun. My only complaint is it needs a medium difficulty. Easy is too easy but the other one is too hard to beat. still really fun though!-
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting!! I can't believe people who don't like this game. You need to play this game!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was up late last night finishing a this book. The psycho-ass folks in the book have disturbed me!!!<br />This author did a fabulous job in writing this story and getting into the nuances of marriage and crazy-ass people. I wish I had never met these characters. I keep thinking how in the world did their story turn out. If you like a good mystery, this is one smart book.<br />I'm very impressed with Flynn's execution, style, plot, narrative, narrator, all of it. I hate these people though (everyone except GO).<br />I can't imagine that any person exist in this world like these characters, but maybe they do. That thought is so disturbing!! I need to talk to a therapist or somebody after reading this book. Who would live like this?<br />One thing about reading on a Kindle, if the story does not wrap up neatly, you think there should be more pages left in the book. I couldn't believe the story was over the way Flynn ended it. But it is an apt ending. Best book I've read in a while.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun and addicting. My cousin got me interested by playing it, so I got on my kindle and it was the top free app. I figured it was going to be okay, but next thing I knew it, I was the the 6x6 grid level 28! Plus, you can skip levels and it does get hard. I highly recommend this app. :)
B00632HWOG|2.0|Displays emails nicely but only seems to download a random sampling of messages. Better to just use a web browser.
1402210086|5.0|This was the first book that I read by Georgette Heyer and I was hooked!  The characters are all very charming and well developed.  The story is very light hearted and fun which makes this an easy read.  In addition to writing several great plots that are interwoven throughout the novel, Georgette Heyer is the master of regency history.  From her use of regency vocabulary to including great details of regency society it makes it so much more than just a romance novel.<br /><br />Kitty Charing is still one of my favorite Heyer heroines, though Sophy Stanton-Lacy of The Grand Sophy still takes the top spot.  Freddy was certainly not one of my favorite heroes, and it took a long time to warm up to him but it was worth it!  Completely recommend this novel for regency enthusiasts!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|it may take like two hours to download but,  it is all worth it. sometimes,  spidey goes on a wall at like the worst times ever like,  during a fight ( while you are protecting somebody) or whenever you timed on something, like going to a certain place an the city.but over all, it is pretty good.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|I absolutely love Supernatural and Sam and Dean Winchester are my favorite characters on the show.  I have watched since the first season and am very happy that the show is continually renewed.<br /><br />Some of the things that made this show enjoyable for me were not really present this season.  I most disliked the fact that almost all of the regular characters are dead or seldom seen.  While Bobby is involved in a different way I would hate for them to pull a Sam and Dean and bring him back (I'm trying not to spoil the plot!).  It would certainly be the easy way out of this.  I also missed the Impala and while this new breed of monsters was ok, I couldn't quite understand that all the other creatures were MIA.<br /><br />The brothers go through many gut-wrenching events this season, and Castiel is as amazing as ever!  The Castiel storyline was probably my favorite this season!<br /><br />I will purchase this season to watch all the episodes back to back because it was very hard to follow the story because there were big gaps of several weeks before the CW would show a new episode.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|I love this game for the graphics and the game it self.<br />My question is there another game just like this one.
B003L77G6A|5.0|If you have never watched Sheldon in action you are missing out. This is one of the best shows on TV today.
0439023521|3.0|On a scale if 1-10 this is a 9 for creative writing.  It is a really mean and scary story of adults pitting children against each other to the death.  Is this fun to read.  No.
B000VSYDRM|2.0|This murder mystery was not one of our favorites--but we are not fans of period pieces.  We didn't care for the dirty, gritty aspects of this period film.  The ending was rather fanciful too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great third book of the series, I read this one slower than the other 2 because I didn't want it to end.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|This isn't my usual genre, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Wool 1-5 kept me reading, and I see how many people enjoyed it. The writing was good, the characters interesting, the situation unusual. I did lose interest about half way through Wool 4, but had enough invested to see how it ended. I doubt I'd read another book by this author, but it was worth my time.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Haven't had any problems with this app whatsoever. The only complaint (minor) is that some of the functionality is pretty hidden -  for example to access the timer, etc.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so addicting!!  I love it then it gets challenging!  go ahead and download its so worth it I thought it was a dumm hale but my sister downloaded cause she thought it was fun I was like no its dumm but turns out I was wrong and she was right I don't regret getting this game at all so go ahead and get it!!  :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|got this free app on my kindle fire and just love it! its very simple and very addicting! I would totally recommend it to anyone!<br />Plus the bonus that its FREE! :)
B0077SGMXM|3.0|I got ssg for free and it's ok, but seems a lttle tedious and redundant. I wouldn't pay for it though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book reinforces every awful female stereotype and for some reason women seem to love it. I have no idea. I am a male and all I can see in the \\"protagonist\\" is a manipulative, selfish, abusive, arrogant man. Meanwhile the heroine is a ditsy (well more luck downright idiotic) naive virgin who falls for him. The plot is thin (major understatement). From what I gather the main purpose of the book is to show that women like douchebags and male a**holes get what ever they want in life. I know the plot is supposed to be about how people change, but when you start off a book with two static stereotypes of human beings and then have no character development throughout the whole thing, I have to say it falls flat on its face.<br /><br />So I guess, then only read this if you want to read some porn. But even then, you know what better in that area than this...actual porn. At least you could find something romantic to watch. Granted I know a lot of porn is degrading to women, but this book is even worse. At least porn can be taken at face value; if you were to really read this book I think you would find at its core it is extremely detrimental to any women who finds the characters to be examples of a good relationship.
B000VNMMQG|2.0|This movie was full of obscenities, smoking, during the first 10-12 minutes; I turned it off and threw it in the garbage.  I would not say that this is a \\"Christian\\" movie, as advertised.  It is about a Christian man--but too much of Hollywood for me.<br />  If you want Christian movies--The Kendrix brothers productions:  Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous etc. are excellent.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I took a break from another book to read this as it was a lender on Amazon.  This book is a quick read and will motivate those who struggle with starting and completing a project.  If I had read this years ago, I probably would've all ready written enough books to fill an entire library!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game had a lot of potential, but sadly it didn't fit my phone screen. I have a Droid razr.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Got this as FAOTD, it's a fun puzzle game. Runs fine on Droid 3, looks OK, controls are a little touchy on long press - sometimes it'll just try to move the screen, other times it'll think I want to move across the row instead of up/down the column. This game would be great on a tablet-size screen.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I usually go for the Stephen King and Dean Koontz kind of books - freaky stuff. I read this one for a change of pace and LOVED it! NEVER saw the end coming. Now planning to read Mission Flats and The Strangler. All I can say is \\"keep 'em comin' Mr Landay\\".
0783230370|5.0|I love this movie so much, I think I'm obsessed with it! I'm just in love with Schwarzenegger's character, Dr. Alex Hesse. In the beginning of the film, he is very ernest, obedient, and almost literally married to his job as a scientist. But when he becomes pregnant (which is a result of an experiment in order to try out a new wonder drug to prevent miscarriages), he begins to show the classic symptoms of pregnancy. He had morning sickness, mood swings, and he ESPECIALLY had cravings; but the most important side affect of condition was a motherly bond between him and the baby. Alex was only supposed to take carry out the experiment for the entire first trimester, but what happens is that he becomes emotionally becomes attached to the baby, and he decides to have it. There are many scenes where he shows his symptoms in the cutest way possible! I promise you, if you're looking for a cute, witty, and light-hearted movie, JUNIOR is your movie!
B00884GR0W|3.0|about a minute into the game it crashes no matter what I do. possibly memory size. on kindle. 19 20.
B00846REIS|4.0|Like many people, I came across this as a \\"if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey\\" read. Enjoyed the pacing a great deal. Sex scenes are good, too. Overall, it's worth reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. easy to play and lots of fun for young and old. excellent graphics.  love chasing scratch all over for coins.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|a very good book ! well written, interesting plot and characters, and a very surprising twist in the end. i really enjoyed reading this book, and i recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This looked like a really fun game, but the formatting is such that i can't see the far left row in the smallest puzzles. Combined with the fact that it is very hard to connect that row as well made the game unplayable.
0345803485|1.0|All the 1star reviews are generous compared to what I just listened, maybe I should read it instead of paying for it on audible.
B007V4LKRU|5.0|Rush has had a very long career, now on their 19th studio release (not counting \\"Feedback\\" or any compilation albums).  They have traversed from rock, through the synth/new wave era, to using a lot of keyboards, to using less keyboards, to getting heavier and back solidly into the rock relm.  \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is an amazing mixture of heaviness, new ideas, and old reminders.  From the beginning band entrance in \\"Caravan\\", the album takes you on a musical story (and journey).  The musicianship is stellar (as always).  You can hear throwbacks to earlier albums (check out the \\"Bastille Day\\" reference in \\"Headlong Flight\\").  The boys are belting it out throughout the album.  \\"The Anarchist\\" is my favorite, being driven rhythmically.  All the while, the band it tight and certainly knows how to play off each other.  After this time, I am sure it's Second Nature to them (heh....you all get that reference to \\"Hold Your Fire\\"?).<br /><br />What an amazing studio release that I absolutely cannot wait to hear live!  If it's anything like Mr. Peart's lyric in \\"Caravan\\", it will be BIG!
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is a lot of fun, terribly addictive and challenging enough to keep you going, just 1 more time...
0439023491|4.0|For the most part, this book was great and lived up to my expectations of a sequel to The Hunger Games, and I will still definitely be reading Mockingjay in the near future.<br /><br />I've heard and read a lot of complaints about the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale (though unless Peeta and Gale are considering a relationship with each other, I suppose it really isn't a triangle, but anyway), and usually that sort of thing doesn't interest me; but in the context of this book, and especially in the way Katniss at least considers the third option of remaining single because she never wants to have children who might be forced to participate in the Games, it wasn't a turn off for me.  A *lot* of focus is put on this relationship drama, especially in the first half of the book, but since Katniss is not a drama queen and Collins is such a good writer, I didn't really get sick of it.<br /><br />I can suspend my disbelief, in this book and the previous one, enough to believe that each District has been subdued enough by the Capitol to allow their children to be sent to the Hunger Games each year.  What I can't believe though is the way Katniss acts when...<br /><br />***MAJOR SPOILERS***<br /><br />... she returns to the games and starts pretty much offing, or trying to off, people when she's been so disgusted and traumatized by the Games and the deaths and punishment of others previously. Collins tries to explain this away by Katniss thinking Peeta's the only good one of the bunch, with her and the other tributes just built to kill basically, but it doesn't jive.  Also, there did not seem to be any good reason that she and Peeta were not trusted to know what was going on with the rebellion, especially in light of the facts that Katniss thought about and tried to kill people who might've been important, and she just happened to be in the right place at the right time and to intuit what to do to pull off their escape without knowing anything that was going on.  That is way too much coincidence to ignore.<br /><br />However.  Because it was so well-written otherwise, I can't give it any lower than a 4.  I really did love this book, even if the ending bugged me, and I'm still excited to read Mockingjay..  That is way too much coincidence to ignore.<br /><br />However.

0812415027|5.0|Mr Herriot has a very interesting if not downright unique way of telling a story from the perspective of a country veterinarian about the animals he treats. What's unique about that? Well, it's not just the particular animal he's observing, but also the far reaching interrelationships of it's people parents he's looking at through the kaleidoscope of life's pulsating dynamics.
B000002OOY|5.0|I am never disappointed when I here a score of John Williams.Every score he makes, wheather it to be adventurous,mystical,romantic,child like,ethnic,etc.,Williams will always deliver,and Jurassic Park is no exception.This score has everything that we can expect.I found it odd that I could not find this in a CD store or iTunes for that matter, but I am glad that Amazon.com has film lovers like me that keep these film scores cataloged and stored for people that would like to buy and enjoy these scores one day.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it was fun and I like that you have goals nod. just collect money like some games but worth it definetly for kindle :)
B0034G4P94|5.0|I really enjoyed this story of a family who is reconciled through violence.  The story is well wrought and gritty yet not raw in an oppressing manner.  The characters are believable, like a slice of hard life.  The acting was excellent.  The director Nolan mentions just how talented Tom Hardy is at acting through his eyes, especially conveying the emotion of unbridled rage.  The actors also got into a peak physical condition to help make the fighting scenes seem real.  The film fits together quite well and the climactic ending is pretty emotional.  One would have to be a savage not to be moved by the reconciliation.  I also liked the Moby Dick undertones through the Father who listens to the tapes.  There is also some insightful writing.  I especially liked the comment of the principal who after the main character teacher says \\"C'mon it's not that bad.\\"  The principal replies, \\"Do you mean that literally or figuratively?  Cause literally it looks bad, and figuratively it looks even worse.\\"  So the principal (or rather the writer of the movie script) wisely discerns that one expression or one word may assume both literal and figurative meanings.  Literally the face of the teacher was injured bad and looked bad.  Figuratively the face of the teacher was even worse because of the bad example or scandal he set for his students and the school public.  Good writing!  The training scene was also excellent with some good music to get you psyched up for your training sessions.  Definitely a Mans Man movie.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|as it is said in many of the reviews the game is a bit pricy for a game app and has a flaw of starting at stage 1 at random, which only happened once to me so far, it is a great game and well worth the buy.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is fun to play. my don also likes to play this game. he says the monkeys have skinny legs.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|This app is really well done.  The graphics and movement are great.  The physics of the moving components is much better than most other similiar types of games.  A lot of fun!
B005PK5O5Q|5.0|The reason I like the Dr. Who series is because of its variety. You never know who the next Dr. will be and what form or personality he will have. This series are some of the better ones. I love the special effects and the story lines are fantastic. The Dr.'s female companions have all been gorgious and are great eye candy.<br />I can't wait until the next season starts.

B004XXIHS2|5.0|Murder mysteries aren't my favorite genre, but this is a notable exception.  I figured I'd take a chance on it in a Daily Deal and I wasn't disappointed.  The balance of mystery and suspense is excellent from start to finish.  Subtle details serve as a clever combination of clues and misdirection throughout the plot.  I don't typically reread books, but this is a case where it might be interesting to make a second pass to pick up on details that previously seemed inconsequential.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I could play this game for hours it is really interesting I love throwing the acorn things it is funny I would recomend this game to everyone
B004I8WD7S|3.0|It is my first order for this line of product.  So far it is serving my purpose.  There were other expensive products but I chose this because the price was right and I wanted to test it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it, entertaining.  always something to do when you come back.  th movie clips are very funny.  Great for the kids.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I recently purchased this movie on a an impulse. I had seen it previously in theaters and with amazon supplying an instant video with purchase you cant pass it up. Its a movie that has a lot of nods toward the original stories or sherlock holmes. It is of course americanized to accommodate the viewers need for excitement to remain interested. The convincing cast with an action pact plot with subtle intellectual dialogue and remarks makes this a movie worth watching again and again. This movie aims to entertain and so it does.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I am pretty addicted to this game. I enjoy it even if I'm not really reminded of the old computer game.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Just have to say this book is a great bargain, but would have happily payed more for it. It is on of the few books this year that has really griped me and finished it in two days. I'm not good at writing reviews, but just wanted to say that it is definitely worth a read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have been playing for weeks and keep coming back every day. The latest version incorporates the new film with all new goals and a neat storyline.  The game plays well whether I am nonlinear or away from the Internet. I highly recommend Ice Age Village.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a well-done picross-like game. I appreciate the ability to zoom in easily, and there are some thoughtful touches, like when it lets you know how many cells you have filled when you are dragging to fill. Only a couple of issues. The interface makes it a little cumbersome to switch between the cell markings, because you have to press the same cell multiple times to get the mark you want, and it's sometimes easy to get lost on big boards. Overall still very enjoyable.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|there is a good selection of games and some for everyone. also if you create your create a review you earn 250,000 points. this is a great app
0007477155|1.0|The title of the product is simply dishonest. Books 6 and 7 of the planned 7-book series have not been published yet, so this cannot be a true seven-book set. It is no coincidence that books 1 and 2 were divided in half to reach the magic number of seven total books and deceive potential customers. Quite dishonest, really. The full seven-book series won't be complete for another 3-4 years by the author's own admission.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|My impression of Drive was a bit underwhelming.  It's partially my own fault because the preview made it look more like an action movie then it really was.  Had I been privy to what it that information, I might have had a better experience.  However, I understand the marketing aspect of getting an expanded demographic into the theater as well, and I know why they made it look that way.  But in any case, I would expect a movie called Drive to have a little more...well, driving.  The movie is good, don't get me wrong, but a more accurate moniker might have been, `Drive...a little'.  To be more open minded, let me say that the dramatic aspect was very good.  There were elements that really let the actors shine and the script was good.  It plays out like a 70s action flick that Steve McQueen might have done.  The plot centers on a young part time stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver.  He befriends a young single mother in his building and makes an attachment with her 7 year old boy.  When her convicted husband is released from jail and comes back to re-enter her life, he steps aside only to find out that the husband is still in debt to a local mob boss.  In an effort to help the mother and her son, he offers to help him pull off a job that will wipe out his debt.  Unfortunately, the deal goes south and things get ugly from there.  Drive is a crime drama, hands down.  And in that guise it plays out beautifully.  Ryan Gosling plays the role of The Driver with cold determination and few words.  He lets his mannerisms and facial cues do the acting.  It's subtle and very effective for the character.  The mood throughout the movie is dark and desperate.  The characters are all at the end of their rope, including the antagonists.  So despite the lack of car chases, Drive is a good movie.  You just have to be careful of how you view the marketing.

B003JYOEYM|3.0|The PlayStation Network was offering a pre-theatrical release HD rental of Survival of the Dead back in 2010, so I just had to give it a try. And as it turned out, Survival of the Dead was, quite simply put, dumb. But ya gotta throw an extra star at the guy that started it all back in 1968, right?<br /><br />Romero allows a 2004 top notch remake of [[ASIN:B001CW7ZW6 Dawn of the Dead]] by Zack Snyder that takes the zombies to a new level: they're really vicious, they run, they seem a little smarter, and (yuck) they can give birth. Then the following year, in Romero's [[ASIN:B001CW7ZVC Land of the Dead]], the zombies seem to have forgotten how to run but now they are even smarter than in the Dawn remake. They're like \\"learning zombies\\". And that's the concept Romero goes with in Survival. Plus in Survival of the Dead there's this whole Hatfield versus McCoy's-esque thing going on, which to me was just a distraction from what I was really here for: Zombies chasing people around in a world gone mad. But no, the \\"When Zombies Attack\\" theme is overshadowed by this family feud that occurs on a remote island that 4 survivors from the mainland (including one that first appeared in 2007's Diary of the Dead) try to make it to after hearing that it might be a safe haven from the zombie infested world.<br /><br />I thought that the 1990 remake of [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]] was terrific. Survival was fun, and it was probably better than the forgettable [[ASIN:B001CDLARQ Diary of the Dead]], but it was a step away from the realistic situations predominant in the more recent versions of Night of and Dawn of. (Wait a minute...realistic situations...the walking dead...???)<br /><br />Oh, speaking of \\"the walking dead\\"...are you familiar with the comic book series [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead]]? If not you're missing out on a fabulous spinoff of Night of the Living Dead. Don't like comic books or graphic novels? Well you're in luck because AMC started converting the comic books into a series in the fall of 2010; the [[ASIN:B005CA4SQK First Season]] was all headed up by [[ASIN:B000Q67876 Frank Darabont]]...and the show is great. Anyway, I digress....<br /><br />I was entertained by Survival of the Dead and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on it, especially George A loyalists. At least what George seemed to lack in a more believable plot line he faithfully made up for in going for the gross out.g the comic books into a series in the fall of 2010; the [[ASIN:B005CA4SQK First Season]] was all headed up by [[ASIN:B000Q67876 Frank Darabont]]...and the show is great.

B001PPGAJE|5.0|In the summer of 2000 my dreams were finally realized. An X-Men movie was released. Going into this I had no idea if they could pull it off, but did they ever. The story was amazing, the acting was amazing, and the visuals were pretty good for the time period. This is the first time I had ever seen Hugh Jackman in any movie. I had no idea if he could pull of the lead character of Wolverine, because he is much taller than him in the comics. But he did an amazing job, and became one of my favorite actors. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen also nailed their characters of Xavier and Magneto. The story is great as it takes you through Wolverine's shoes while he has to decide if he wants to join the X-men as they fight against the brotherhood of mutants. Wolverine is conflicted on which side is the right side to take, but chooses the side of the X-Men. Bryan Singer did an amazing job directing this masterpiece and Michael Kamen provided the score to the film. This and X2 are in my opinion the best X-Men movies, but they go downhill from there unfortunately.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|A wonderful movie, with so much great character development as well as some very funny situations.  Euro pudding is my idea of a great dessert, and I was hooked on this movie the moment the fast-forward motion kicked in to charge us through the predictability of the business environment.  Other cinematic techniques are beautifully used to capture inner states of mind, transitions or crises.  So much more than your typical coming-of-age movie!  Plus a terrific score - it is too bad that a soundtrack is not available.
B001PPGAJY|5.0|After X-Men came out in 2000 it wasn't long until the sequel was confirmed. Usually sequels are never as good as the originals but this one I think is a step ahead. The groundwork had already been laid in X-Men so this movie could just jump right of the ground into the story. This movie has a great deal about Wolverine trying to figure out who he is and how he got his adamantium skeleton. Some new characters are also introduced, including Nightcrawler and Deathstrike. The highlight of the movie is definitely the Wolverine - Deathstrike battle at the end. I think its the best scene out of all the X-Men movies. Another cool scene is when Wolverine steals Cyclops's Mazda RX-8 which is a really cool car. I do think this movie could have used more Cyclops in it, as he is one of my favorite X-Men characters. I wish the rest of the X-Men movies were as good as this one but they all go downhill from here.
B004G8ZZHU|3.0|This movie is definitely in the \\"so bad it's good category\\" for me.  It's loud, stupid with a very limited plot line, a half-baked romance, basic physics defying action sequences and goofy one-liners.  However, that being said its actually really funny with the four main actors clearly having nice rapport with each other and embracing the spirit of the 80's TV show.  In particular, there is one stand out, Sharlto Copley as Howling Mad Murdoch, who really seems to relish the character and embodies the ridiculous spirit that was the 80's action genre.  You get the feeling that he's just improvising his dialogue throughout the movie and that gives it a fun free spirited feel.  Overall, a good movie for fans of the original program.
B0080TBS40|4.0|The Chris Robinson Brotherhood Big Moon Ritual is a pleasant experience in the jam band genre. I have found most all music that he is a part of to be good listening over the years. Only 7 tracks in this effort, but it clocks in at about an hour's worth of tunes.  I swear Jerry Garcia is sitting in on guitar which is the same vibe I got when hearing live tracks of the band previously.  If you are expecting Black Crowes like material and closed to a different style of music from a talented artist with a new band, you are not going to apppreciate this.  This is a step away from the Crowes style, but I like it a lot.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first 50 book was just kinky enough to get me so hooked that I had to buy the second within days.  What kept me hooked on the series is that during the second book, the love story between Christian and Ana really develops.  You are able to see another side, other than the kinky side, of Christian.  One that will likely make every woman say \\"I want to be loved like that one day\\".  Ana also matures and finds her footing in her relationship with Christian.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Awesome movie all around. Great story and plot. I'm a baseball fan and I really, really enjoyed this movie. Explains so much about the business of baseball. It really makes me want to sit in on the meetings that the GM's and scouts have and to be an insider on the business of baseball. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. If you despise baseball this might not be the movie for you, but one should probably know what they're getting into by the title itself.

0062183591|4.0|If you have read other Ariely's books, and you liked them, this one won't disappoint you.<br /><br />Ariely uses a recurring technique to \\"prove\\" some very interesting social theories. He has been criticized for the lack of formality in his experiments, not withstanding his phd's. I'd be more specific and say that his problem is the lack of sample representativity.<br />Statisticians probably cringe when reading the many assumptions that Ariely and his collaborators make, and rightfully so. For instance, in an experiment to determine if dishonesty is contagious, he has an actor cheating blatantly and getting away with it. The rest of the students -and it's students his study subjects most of the time- then cheat a lot more. He calls this the Madoff effect, and to differentiate it from a pure cost-benefit calculation a student may make, in a parallel experiment the actor asks a question that clearly hints at the possibility of cheating without being caught.<br /><br />To Ariely, this is proof that we cheat not only as a result of a cost-benefit calculation. And this is probably the main thesis of this book. He's out to disprove SMORC (Simple Model Of Rational Crime) which assumes that the only reason we do or don't cheat is based on this cost-benefit mental calculation we all make.<br /><br />Clearly SMORC is just too simple a model to explain human behavior, but Ariely destroys it and builds in its place a building that slices honesty and dishonesty in several dimensions: distance helps us to be dishonest, as we find it easier to steal through check fraud than through cash. Favors, conflicts of interest and exhaustion make us more lenient and or dishonest. Revenge helps us justify our dishonest behavior. Interestingly, Ariely tries to show that wearing fake sunglasses makes us more prompt to cheat. Here for instance you see a clearly extrapolation that Ariely's critics dislike so much. Having female students wear fake sunglasses is extrapolated to \\"wearing fake makes us cheat more.\\" it's not female students, it's everyone and it's not fake Chloe sunglasses, it's fake anything.<br /><br />Whatever the faults of his research, this is a very interesting reading, plenty of humorous anecdotes and easy to follow.<br />If anything Ariely is giving more serious researchers (and I don't mean it as an insult) an excellent basis to follow up. I don't mean it as an insult because his experiments are so extensive that if he concentrated in only in a few of them to say, take a more representative sample, he would need to spend the rest of his life doing this. In other words this is a very horizontal study that can be taken by many other social researchers to drill into it.<br /><br />I fully recommend it. It proves some intuitive ideas, but it also surprises us and makes us think harder about other's and particularly our own honesty.<br /><br />Towards the end Ariely tries to prove that dishonesty in the US is no different in China than in Israel or Canada.<br /><br />Well, just to make a point, China is probably the Mecca of 'fake' fashion, and not only wearing but producing it! How do you then reconcile this with his previous conclusion that wearing fake makes us more dishonest? I will say it again: get a more representative sample!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Inside Job is an excellent documentary.  It provides a comprehensive account of the events leading up to one of the most devastating financial events of our time. The global impact is depicted via direct interviews and commentaries. Inside Job offers the viewer an opportunity to understand how the sequence of events and executive decisions led to the financial posturing of our current economy.  This should be required viewing for persons involved with banking, real estate, insurance, financing, etc.

B001KW0C96|1.0|I only saw this movie once several years ago, but I remember it clearly.  With this caliber of actors involved in the project I expected a good movie and was excited to see it.  About 45 minutes into this stinker, I looked at my wife and told her that it was obvious that the ______ character was the killer.  After sitting through another hour of redundancy, I was correct.<br /><br />When you are 1/3 of the way through the movie and can guess exactly how it will end, that is the sign of a terrible movie.  For two actors that are this good to be in a movie this bad, they better have gotten paid well.
B008K8U13K|1.0|I would really love to rate this game (won't let you post without any stars, shame really) but since I continually get a black screen I can't rate something I can't play.

030758836X|5.0|This book was just way too much fun - and I mean that in a good way.  I'm taking a leisurely drive down the garden path of the story, when BAM - right in the middle it makes a u-turn and we are on the damn highway doing 90 miles an hour (commonly referred to as a plot twist).  Sweet Mother of Mercy!<br /><br />There is not much to say without the risk of giving up some detail that's best left secret.  Soooo many time I wanted to just take one little peek at the end to see what happens to Nick and Amy.  But I didn't.  I survived the heart pounding suspense and made it to the end of a very satisfying read.<br /><br />I must, must must check out more books by Ms. Flynn
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, have read it more than 1 time, if there are any more to this series I will buy them
B000FCKGPC|5.0|There's a ton of criticism about this book that I sympathize with, however, I also feel like there was a lot of necessary details that took us away from the constant intensity we crave which pull the characters together and help us make important connections in the story.  DO I wish there was all that AND MORE detail about the \\"main\\" characters such as the surviving Stark fave's? Sure, yes!  But, I also appreciate the story still. I must confess I really can't stand the iron Islands Folks!  I could do without them.  but that's just me.  I feel like this book is a bit of filler and certainly was detailed about certain characters that kept me deeply engrossed.  I just finished reading this book today. July 15, 2012. I am going to try and refrain from reading ADWD for a while so I can savor it and jump right into AWoW. I'll try but not sure I can take it without Westeros for too long. I have a bunch of other books lined up in my Kindle, including a few by GRRM and a couple recommended by GRRM.<br />:)<br />Love Him!!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|great for kindle fire at least I think so but yea it works really well in my opinion so yea
B0010SEMP0|4.0|My thoughts on this book are pretty much the same as my thoughts on the first book of this series--except that a touch of the originality was gone because I've met all these characters and situations before. This was a very entertaining book. I liked the characters and the fighting, and the romance was hot. For more details, please see my review of Halfway to the Grave.<br /><br />One more thing before I end this short review: There was a moment in the big sex scene where I had to go back and reread because I couldn't believe the author had written it. It would make me blush to go into more detail. (I'm sure if you look for more details in some of the other reviews, you will find out what I'm talking about.) Granted, I'm relatively new to any kind of erotica, so I may be a little prudish here. For me, that bit of the scene took a little bit of my enjoyment away; it was too much for me.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Now, I'm not one who loves books with vampires and all that other stuff. It's sort of weird I even considered buying this book. I'm a Jack Reacher-Mitch Rapp kinda gal. I bought this book since it was on sale and it was on my wish list. Someone, somewhere recommended it. Normally, I'm not that much of a sucker for recommendations. However, bought it. Started reading it Friday and finished it Sunday am at 0100.<br /><br />It's about witches, vampires and daemons. It's a great \\"forbidden\\" love story. I liked the characters in the book. It all made sense to me once you realize you're reading about all these creatures. Makes me want to go to Oxford, see the library, walk the streets and take a yoga class or two. Loved the history thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Needless to say, the sequel just came out and I bought that this morning. I'm keeping my fingers crossed it's as good. Now, when I check the title of this book, I see it's a trilogy. Let's hope the hits keep on coming.

B005LVQA9S|5.0|This book is worth every penny, no matter how many pennies are spent. Much like the Shellcoder's Handbook and their other books, this one is written with the same professional quality and technical detail. It's incredibly accurate, and starts on a very low level of understanding. Even if you are an experienced web hacker, it's useful to see new angles on things or get a few ideas for more advanced ideas of your own creation. The tool JAttack it takes you through making is a superb tool to build off of later. It waits to take you to the tool-building until after its built your foundation with techniques, as well, which is perfect progression.<br /><br />All in all, this book will take beginners and pros alike and serve as an excellent reference and lesson to bump you to whatever level of web application hacker you can be.
B004FOA84A|1.0|very disappointed and waste $<br />nothing stated about compatibility issues!<br />I think there should either be free trial to see if compatible or at least a note of warning
0061122416|1.0|I guess a lot of people are seduced by this book the same way they're seduced by The Secret.  Somehow people like the lure of something for nothing, thinking that if they just keep thinking of what they want that they'll get it, or the universe will provide it.  You can be thrown in solitary confinement and if you sit there all day thinking of what you want, guess what, it's not coming.  So this book is not real life and you can't expect to will your way into what you want, instead you have to work for it and you need some luck on your side.<br /><br />The book does have some good quotes but that's about it.  As a whole it's poorly written with no character development and a lot of religious mishmash that doesn't really add to that \\"The Secret\\" \\"revelation\\" the author wants to provide but instead just wants to leave readers with lower intellect thinking they read something profound.

A Twisted Sister pin on your uniform\\" Thats right Twisted Sister hit it big in 1984, but they had to work hard to get there...With record lebels here in the states refusing to sign the band, they recorded \\"UNDER THE BLADE\\", originally released in Europe (limited). The album was re-recorded and re-released by Atlantic records in 80's....This is NOTHING like \\"STAY HUNGRY\\", this album is more hard core rock, just short of speed metal....If your a SMF friend of TWISTED SISTER, you will  love this early hard core version of the band.....PLAY IT LOUD, MUTHA!!!

B0000074LY|5.0|Hey there, all you SMF's out there, this was to be the last album the band would record before dis-banding in Oct. 1987. It could also be considered the nail in the coffin for the band....This album is good, but being as it was originally intended to be Dee Snider's solo album, it is NOTHING like other Twisted albums....Love songs, etc. When the record label forced the band to record this album, it caused tensions in the band that would ultimately cause the bitter split in 1987....Not a bad album, just not what you would expect from the band that produced songs like: UNDER THE BLADE, YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK N' ROLL, WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT, SIN AFTER SIN, and so on....

B0002MB7R6|5.0|This is one of my favorite disaster films! I actually like it more than Independence Day which I felt was way over acted in some scenes. But anyway, the special effects were awesome! All that water comming into New York all at once. And the ship that floats down flooded city streets. Some of the plot is based on fact. There are bouies in the ocean that measure currents, ocean temps. & a lot of other stuff. Scientists do drill for those I cores they show at the beginning of the movie. But I doubt whether a person with an arm load of ice core containers could make the jump Queid does. I'm currently reading a book about the little ice age that ended in the 1800's & that book nrings out a warming trend that caused the NAO  to go haywire & cause the little ice age. So..... That's what movies often do, they excite us & cause us to take note of things around us. Maybe enough interest will develop to do something.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I saw Brave for the first time yesterday and was so deeply touched by the relationship between the mother and daughter.  The music is great - the accents are a wonderful new experience for the audience and the overall story is wonderful.  The main character Merida grows so much in her understanding of her mother and herself throughout the story.  And the mother-daughter relationship grows in depth as they move through the challenges they face.  Highly recommend this movie for children - especially girls - ages 8 and older.  Younger ones may need a little support with the scary scenes and there are a few which is why it is rated PG.  Fantastic production from digital animation that rocks to the voices for each character!  5 Star Rating for sure!! Can't wait to own my own copy!
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I was a senior in high school when this movie was on tv. It scared me something terrible! I had met a lady who had come here from Japan, she survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in august 1945. She had horrible skin scars from it. So, this movie peaked my curosity. The scenes where people just vaporized after becoming skeletonized caused me to have nightmares & to sleep under my bed for weeks afterward. The next day at school it's all everyone talked about. We all worshiped President Reagan so we knew we were safe. But one never new about those pesky Soviets. I would say this movie was one of the major influences my life later took. Very scary, haunting. And it is still with me even after all these years.

B002BI6SMI|3.0|This was a pretty good one, though like another poster said, Liam Neeson hasn't done any bad films, IMO. It is satisfying and exciting, especially since all the bad guys are preying on innocent girls. They deserve whatever they get, all of them, only more slowly. As with any kind of \\"right vs wrong\\" story, I wonder how those who started out as human beings, with hearts and souls, became so devoid of humanity that they would do these horrible things without blinking an eye.<br /><br />The one thing that really really REALLY annoyed me was the exwife. She clearly had her issues with Neeson's character as a husband, and that was fine, but to see her take every opportunity to interfere and take verbal jabs and sabotage his relationship with his daughter was infuriating, as well as really bad parenting. No one in their right mind would just say, \\"oh you want to go bebop around Europe alone, with no supervision of any kind? Sure let me sign the permission,\\" without even having a moment to think about it. Of course IMO no parent in their right mind would let their teen daughter do it anyway. It seemed as though the exwife was willing to send their daughter into as risky a situation as she could, just to spite Neeson, with his concerns born of knowledge. I wanted her at the end to just say she was wrong, but all she would say was \\"bring her back to ME,\\" as though Neeson were merely the deliveryman, and had no real emotional stake in it. I thought it was pretty cold of the daughter to leave him alone at the airport as well. It seemed that both parents consisted basically of trying to outdo each other in giving the daughter everything she wanted, not stellar parenting there either.<br /><br />While there was quite a bit of implausibility, the thing that got me was that the rich dudes at the auction would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for sex with a virgin girl? I mean, really? I am no expert on this but it seems to me that that is alot of money for something not that big a deal. It seems more likely to me that people would pay more for \\"different,\\" less mainstream sexual tastes.

B006PTL1QM|4.0|\\"A Dangerous Method\\", directed by David Cronenberg, is a screen adaptation by Christopher Hampton of his own stage play, \\"[[ASIN:0571214851 The Talking Cure]]\\". The idea for this biographical drama derives from John Kerr's scholastic study of 1994, \\"[[ASIN:1609984862 A Most Dangerous Method]]\\", which chronicles the rise of psychoanalysis as a clinical treatment of hysteria and other mental conditions and explores the relationship between Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung and the catalytic role played in both the establishment and demise of that relationship by Sabine Spielrein.  The book is long and detailed in its subject matter, documenting not only clinical methods but also placing events into the social context of their time. It presents an interweaving not just of the personal desires, obsessions and paranoias of its central characters but also of wider events to spin a complex tale of politics, hysteria, anti-Semitism, sexual duplicity, repression and intellectual brilliance wielded as blackmail.<br /><br />Christopher Hampton has done a masterly job of extracting the human interest story from the wider academic treatment, making Sabine Spielrein the true protagonist of the drama. In the screenplay we see her gradual transformation from highly dysfunctional hysteric to eminent and respected psychoanalyst in her own right.  Along the way, she becomes Jung's mistress and is shown as herself being pivotal in a number of the turning points in his life. Alongside, the film details the development of the friendship of the two principal proponents of the emerging field of psychoanalysis, following by the gradual divergence of their ideas, fueled by the inherent differences in the characters and the circumstances in their lives. And always, it seems, with Sabine Spielrein in the mix somewhere.<br /><br />While the exact details of the relationship between Jung and Spielrein remain speculative and conjectural, much of the screen adaptation is given greater authority by an almost obsessional attention to historical detail, with many of the scenes and much of the dialogue drawn from the copious notebooks, diaries and letters that all parties routinely kept and exchanged. There are nevertheless many aspects to the production that are distinctly Cronenberg in style and feel. Overall, he imbues an already uncomfortable tale with an air of voyeurism which shifts the original screenplay into a darker and more unsettling place altogether.<br /><br />The acting is by and large superb. Viggo Mortensen's portrayal of a brooding and somewhat paranoid Sigmund Freud is played to perfection -- and invariably with a cigar to his lips -- while Michael Fassbender does an admirable job of conveying Carl Jung's cautious and self-conscious approach to his own ideas which seems to have left him so susceptible and malleable in his relationships with others. Fassbender does a good job too of portraying Jung's own gradual mental disintegration at the approach of the Great War. Keira Knightly pulls off the role of unstable but brilliant Sabine Speilrein quite well, once one manages to ignore her fluctuating accent. Credit should also go to Vincent Cassel in his almost bit-part role of the wayward Otto Gross -- the serpent who mesmerises his prey -- as well as to newcomer, Sarah Gadon, whose quietly understated performance as Jung's wife, Emma, makes one wish that the writers had been able to find a way to include more of her story in the mix.  Cinematographically, the production is sumptuous (although let down by some over ambitious CGI work in places) whilst Howard Shore's Wagner-derived score is a perfect accompaniment to the scenes that call for it (and nicely absent when not).<br /><br />The DVD production also includes a brief \\"Making of...\\" feature, as well as informative commentary soundtrack by director, David Cronenberg, plus descriptive soundtrack for the unsighted.t obsessional attention to historical detail, with many of the scenes and much of the dialogue drawn from the copious notebooks, diaries and letters that all parties routinely kept and exchanged.

B006T5GTK0|5.0|This original 1956 adaptation of the Nevil Shute book, \\"A Town Like Alice,\\" is a great teaser.  This version stared Peter Finch as Joe Harmon as an Australian POW and Virginia McKenn as Jean Paget, an English woman being marched around the coutnry side of the Malay penninsula by her Japanese captors.  The book, the 1956 movie and a 1981 Masterpiece Theater TV production are all based from an actual incident that took place in Malaya in the early months of 1942.  A number of English women and children were captured by the Japanese.  No officer would take responsibility for them at any internment camps so they were marched hundreds of miles around the countryside.  Many of the women as well as some children, died of disease, fatigue and starvation.  When their Japanese guard dies, Jean Paget brokers a deal with a village elder.  He allows the survivors to stay in his village to plant and harvest rice.  Joe Harmon pilfers and barters for food and medicine to keep them alive which he passes along to Jean Paget.  The two develop a relationship talking about their hometowns.  Jean is drawn to Joe's stories about Alice Springs.  At some point Joe is discovered to have been stealing by the Japanese.  He is beaten and cruicified for his troubles with his fellow POW's and the English women, including Jean Paget, looking on helplessly.  I won't go into any more on this story other than to say the women survive the war.  READ THE BOOK.  Then watch this movie.  Finch and McKenna BOTH won the 1956 BAFTA awards for Best Performance by an actor or actress.  This is the English version of the Academy Award Oscar. A DVD extra includes an interview with several of the performers, including Virginia McKenna and the director.  They provide some nice background information on the making of the film.<br />My three daugthers became familiar with the 1981 Masterpiece Theater version that starred Bryan Brown, Helen Morse and Gordon Jackson.  We fell in love with the story.  On our summer vacations driving cross country we would listen to the book on tape at least three times every summer as we drove all over the country.<br />The 1956 version is much shorter then the 1981 version but the story comes across nicely.  The rock solid performances of Peter Finch and Virginia McKenna are the icing on the cake.  If forced to choose between the 1956 and the 1981 story I would be hard pressed to make the call.<br />Hopefully, Masterpiece Theater will get their version out on DVD.  They are missing a golden opportunity.  The versions that are out there are poorly copied from VHS tape and leave a lot to be desired.<br />You won't go wrong buying this DVD.ations driving cross country we would listen to the book on tape at least three times every summer as we drove all over the country.<br />The 1956 version is much shorter then the 1981 version but the story comes across nicely.

0062060562|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although the pace is slow and not much happens, the suspense is high, and I always had to read on to find out more.<br /><br />I won't explain anything because this would give away some of the plot and reduce the suspense for other readers.<br /><br />On the negative side, there were a few implausiblities. I won't list them, for the same reason. I'll just say they were minor and could probably be explained away, and they didn't spoil the reading experience for me.<br /><br />I bought this book as an ebook from Amazon.co.uk.

Most albums are a few good ones with mostly filler but this shows these guys have real talent that's not just luck coming up with a few catchy hooks.  Listening to the whole album straight through is a joy that takes you through a great ride.

034580404X|4.0|Having listened to the hype and read some of the reviews, I almost missed out.  A lot of the hype and reviews floating around out there made it sound like the books were just badly written porn; and who wants to read badly written porn?  But..., au contraire.  To me it was a very sweet love story about two people with a lot to learn, with one being a little (lot?) more messed up emotionaly than the other.  I loved this story, because, really, most people are messed up in some way.  But personal demons of this sort just aren't normally talked about this honestly.  An imperfect Christian made this a plausible, complex story covering an area I previously knew very little about.  Yes, there's a lot of sex in the story, however the sex and the descriptions where necessary, I think, to tell the story.  The sex was actually an essential character to the story.<br />I also liked the writing.  Ana sounded real, like I could actually know this girl.<br />So, kudos to Ms. James.  I think the story will stick with me for the rest of my life, and isn't that one of the highest compliments one can pay to a book?  Can't wait to hear more of this quality from her.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This is so far the most interesting movie I have seen/ bought all this year! It's an action horror to me, it was'nt slow or boring, the picture and scenes we're great! This 4th installment is more cool than the last ones! Kate Beckinsale was bad to the bone! GREAT MOVIE!!!

B001DHE9KG|4.0|I have read the many reviews for all three of the Boheme performances that I currently own. What is quite clear is that each of them receives enthusiastic support by overwhelming numbers who see each as the definitive version! There are also those who totally dislike each version. There are also minor reservations voiced about each version by a handful of reviewers. So where does this leave the prospective new purchaser?<br /><br />Firstly it is possible to suggest that there are at least 3 good versions available, all of which are likely to give great satisfaction to a great number of people. This is perhaps because this opera is such a fine creation that it enables the participants to rise to their best. So if there is a world class team engaged it is likely that you will get a world class result with little risk of failure.<br /><br />Rather than give a detailed review of each version therefore I will attempt a general summary of the options based on these 3 productions. They are the two Zeffirelli productions at The Met and at La Scala. There is also the Copley production by way of comparison at the Royal Opera.<br />There are some key considerations in my opinion. Firstly the group of four men must work well as a team in addition to individual merits. Rodolfo, Mimi, Musetta and Marcello must also communicate strongly to each other in the same way. The end must be genuinely draining.<br /><br />The Met performance delivers on all counts. Gheorghiu and Vargas both deliver a believable relationship with each other. All 4 men relate well to each other. Tezier and Arteta as Musetta also have a believable relationship and the whole production benefits from the extravagant, but always appropriate Zeffirelli concept ranging through an excellent garret, a spectacular Act 2 crowd scene, and the desolation of Acts 3 and 4. I personally feel that there are preferable Musettas and the small but important roles of Benoit and Alcindoro to those on offer here. The recording is of a good visual and sonic standard but it is a shame that it has not been produced as a Blu-ray (yet). This is a very slick and professional rendition.<br /><br />The competing Zeffirelli performance from La Scala is very fine too. This musters a particularly vibrant team of men who relate especially well together. The Benoit and Alcindoro roles are, to my mind, more effective. The Musetta of Hei-Kyung Hong is simply outstanding and is a far more effective flirty portrayal which also shows considerable humanity and depth of understanding in the last scene. The role of Mimi is very different to that of Gheorghiu as Mimi here is of a far more `ordinary' appearance and without Gheorghiu's innate glamour and sheer `star' quality which always radiates through. Gallardo-Domas portrays much more the ordinary attractions of an ordinary and rather vulnerable woman. In this she is well matched by Alvarez. These two skilled singers relate well in these ways and their shared tragedy hits home at that level. For me, I find this even more moving than The Met performance for all that's star quality. On the downside however, I feel that the staging in Act 2 comes over as rather more cramped and thus relatively static at La Scala and the conducting and orchestral response is just a notch less crisp. A direct comparison between the starts of Acts 1 & 2 in both performances will show this - but the differences are quite small and do not outweigh the many other virtues.<br /><br />That leaves the Copley production at the Royal Opera. I find my responses to this to be more uneven. The four men have the great advantage of being younger and not so well fed! The concept that these four men are living in abject poverty always stretches credulity when they are clearly considerably overweight as in most performances including the two Zefferelli options. However, the downside here is that Rodolfo in particular seems relatively immature and is unable to drag up the reserves of grief at the end. Alvarez does best at this followed at a short distance by Vargas. This Musetta similarly seems to lack the same sort of depth. One is aware that she is acting rather than being the part. Hei-Kyung is in a different league to this - and is also more seductively aware. The other men all do well but the star of this production for me is the Mimi of Gerzmava who has the youth, the voice and the concept of ultimate doomed fragility. The orchestral playing is possibly the best here as a result of fine conducting by Nelsons.<br /><br />In conclusion then I would rate all three as fine productions in their ways with the La Scala / Zefferelli as first choice closely followed by the Met / Zeffirelli in second and with the Royal Opera production in third place. In the end though, it is all a matter of taste and personal preference as detailed reading of the many reviews will clearly reveal. Happy viewing and listening whichever you choose!<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />I can't imagine how many hours it took to do these 3 articulate and interesting Comparative Reviews - thank you on behalf of all the fans of La Boheme, Ian!

B000WC2URM|3.0|This is a well-recorded and performed production of the Nutcracker. However, a word of warning needs to be put for those expecting a 'traditional' production. This is a new staging and interpretation dating from 2001, with a completely different conceptual emphasis for many of the characters and their roles. The costuming and staging is bright and effective and works well in this production. The music is played in a refreshingly fleet manner and this accompanies effective steps in a modern way that I find a little ungainly at times but understandable in the circumstances - Clara is an unloved child at a transitional age in this production for example. Unsuspecting loved children expecting a kind artistic experience might find this rather unsettling although there are many unloved children in real life of course.<br /><br />However there are fine alternatives. There is one for those who would prefer the 'traditional' Peter Wright version familiar to the Royal Ballet followers and which has been filling Covent Garden for years. For those who are familiar with this production there is nothing unexpected about this version and all is danced with the utmost skill within a lavish stage setting. The sound is excellent as is the camera work. This will be the perfect version for huge numbers of people and as such comes with the highest recommendation. It would be a Nutcracker of choice for many people.<br /><br />There are others available which may also appeal. My personal favourite is the Bolshoi Ballet production with choreography by Grigorovich who has a wonderful sense of the epic and knows how to make the most of the large spaces provided by his theatre at the Bolshoi. Anyone who knows the Spartacus ballet for example will be aware of this. There are many breathtakingly beautiful sequences throughout his production - the corps de ballet in the Waltz of the Snowflakes being but one example. The character dances in Act two are refreshingly imaginative while remaining essentially traditional. The Pas de Deux of the Prince and Marie towards the end of Act 3 rises to climatic lifts that do not disappoint emotionally. One could go on and on .......!<br /><br />I also like the San Francisco American setting of the ballet as an alternative version which is largely traditional in flavour and which has a refreshingly different selection of character dances to offer. The Arabian Dance is especially effective in my opinion.<br /><br />Currently we are spoiled for choice, there being well-recorded versions to suit a wide variety of taste as described above. This is one of the least safe in my opinion because of its relatively dark concept, although very fine in its own way. Safer, more 'traditional' options would be the Royal ballet version along with the excellent Bolshoi version. The San Francisco Ballet is also worth considering.<br /><br />For my taste I would choose this as a good alternative, albeit rather dark, concept. However, I find the San Francisco production kinder and would choose either the new Royal Ballet or the Bolshoi version as my favourite single best buy - essentially traditional, well performed, well recorded and crucially, a kinder experienceentially traditional.

B002G1TSBI|5.0|This review is an update to the earlier summary review supplied for the DVD box set. I now have received the Blu-ray upgrade and it has fulfilled all my hopes for a markedly enhanced experience. The performances remain the same of course so much of what follows applies to both the DVD and the Blu-ray issues. Nevertheless it must be stressed at the outset that all the usual advantages of Blu-ray are readily to be enjoyed with this latest version of the recording. Those interested in the upgrade may purchase it without fear of disappointment.<br /><br />The biggest surprise for me when first experiencing this set of the Ring was the effect of considerable movement - much of it fast and urgent. This is a concept far from the old style of `stand and deliver' and it achieves a considerable accumulative effect when followed through the whole set of four operas. For the purposes of this review I will restrict myself to considering the broad issues relating to this set. More specific comments can be found under the individual issues which can still be bought separately on DVD.<br /><br />Quick movement is important to this production as mentioned above. Considerable use is made of the vast stage at Bayreuth so that the settings can be built on an appropriately huge scale and so that characters can move rapidly around unfettered by limitations of space. This enables this entire production to differ fundamentally from many other conceptions that are more constrained by spatial considerations and which frequently have far less urgent movement and which have to rely upon other means to achieve their purpose.<br /><br />Quite apart from the purely musical considerations, this set makes extensive use of laser technology. This is often in the form of shafts of light than can vary in thickness from narrow shafts to sheets of colour.<br /><br />The time period is established as modern to futuristic but of an indeterminate moment. This is achieved via costumes and stage sets which are a mixture of function and abstraction. Key dramatic staging moments are effective - such as Valhalla, the Nibelung realm, toad catching, Mime's furnace, the dragon fight, Brunnhilde's rock etc. The sense of the epic is totally established throughout this set along with the awareness of Wotan's essential instability of character which makes him vulnerable to the errors of judgement which inevitably lead to his and the gods ultimate downfall. This is drama writ large and Barenboim, the producer, the cast and the orchestra fully deliver on all counts.<br /><br />None of this would be worthwhile of course if the musical values were inadequate. In this case the whole cast delivers consistently high standards with not a weak moment anywhere. Wotan, as an unpredictable and dominant God, is superb throughout and is portrayed by John Tomlinson who was at the peak of his powers at the time and in magnificent voice. Wotan is, of course, very much the central figure in this drama and Tomlinson totally succeeds in delivering a clear sense of the epic while Wotan's mental instability is wonderfully shown through his physical presence. Perfect.<br /><br />Loge fulfils his distantly scheming role well and Graham Clark has just the right character for this role. Alberich, portrayed by Gunter von Kannen is powerful and delivers his curse effectively as he must and remains a powerful force throughout.  Mime is also a much stronger than often portrayed and more believable character than usual and Jerusalem, as Siegfried, avoids appearing to be just a spoiled and immature bully. He is at the peak of his form and, to my mind, is far more effective here than in the Levine/Met performance. Hunding and Hagen are both satisfyingly menacing and Seigmunde and Seiglinde make a convincing pair. Brunnhilde, performed by Anne Evans, sings outstandingly throughout and is a totally believable pivotal characterisation. The recorded sound fully supports Barenboim's driving energy. In a word - marvellous.<br /><br />The recording dates from 1992 but has already been digitally enhanced for DVD and now appears as a much improved Blu-ray with sharper image definition and sound (only listened to in DTS surround). What cannot be solved is the considerable amount of trailing light as the film technology of the time could not keep up with the faster actions in the predominantly dark lighting. However I personally find the trailing image effects surrounding the various characters as they move swiftly about rather effective as it emphasises their essentially unpredictable and often unbalanced mental and physical speed. Strange, as normally I would find this a distracting visual problem but it is almost a total positive here. The sound is thrillingly 'real' and is presented in DTS 5.1 (excellent) and stereo (untested)<br /><br />I unhesitatingly find that this is my benchmark preferred version despite having owned two other highly respected video productions on DVD and Blu-ray and therefore equally unhesitatingly give it the full 5 stars even bearing in mind the 1992 recording issues as described above. This is further enhanced by currently being at an astonishingly low bargain price and now available as a Blu-ray and most definitely enhanced.<br /><br />This review summary, it must be stressed yet again, has been written after receipt of the Blu-ray set and is not in anticipation of its arrival. This issue, in my opinion, is simply essential.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|has many versions of the Bible! awesome! no in app purchases! you can create reading plans and have someone read it to you! one of the best features is how you get to receive Jesus Christ!
B0036TGSR6|1.0|Warning: This has spoilers.<br /><br />The acting is OK, but the story moves along at a snails pace and is amazingly boring. The protagonist discovers the big secret and then (are you ready for this) writes a note to the very person who can have him killed along with her henchman like nothing is going to happen. Then walks away from the scene and is killed with the evil bad guys getting away with everything.<br /><br />I sat and watched a very boring movie hoping at least the bad guys would be exposed, but what happens is just one of these typical endings where you feel cheated.<br /><br />I mean why would the very same man who has been chased by the bad guys turn around at the end and let the bad guys know that he knows all their secrets. Don't you think he would have been discrete and gone to the proper authorities and after that then stick his tongue out at them.<br /><br />There is an epidemic of movies recently that have people turn into blithering idiots in that last five minutes of the movie just to get some kind of \\"see how great a director I am\\" response from the braindead people who suck up to this kind of egoistic waste of time.
B000HKWIJ4|5.0|The is the best season of the last startrek show to grace the air waves. just one person can make a defferance bring back star trek to the ari waves.

B003LXSY60|5.0|This was the first Black Keys album I had ever come across and is not necessarily something I would have immediately gone for, but I listened to it, and listened to it, and listened to it and decided I needed to buy it!  Give it a try - you might be surprised.
1596680199|5.0|This book is one of my top 5 go to books, even after working with polymer clay for 3 years, I still find this book to be a wonderful source of inspiration and a joy to just page through. I know this is one of those books that when it wears out, I will be buying again !!<br /><br />Great for beginners looking for a wonderful start into the exciting world of polymer clay, you will no regret this book !
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|always hate games wanting you to make in app purchases though.  wish I could just play and enjoy the game and earn more over time.
0385344228|5.0|It has to be a pretty amazing book for me to even take time and write a review, and here is nothing short of my favorite novel. This book is so well written, you don't juggle the facts and get confused at all. Point and blank, the way it should be. As the reader you have to make up how you feel along the way. You can't help but do so. Landay makes you take part in the story. Absolutely anyone who has time and the opportunity to read this book SHOULD.
1936608898|5.0|This book is a great addition to your paleo book collection. It breaks the paleo lifestyle down to easy to understandable knowledge. I have started this lifestyle and have notice great results just by following the guidelines addressed in this book. It is a must read.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun but pointless. Addictive but dumb. The only reason this game could help you is if you are looking to sharpen your reflexes.
B005U9RXWE|5.0|I have been watching this show since it first came on the air. I don't know how I found it,probably just channel surfing, but am so thrilled I found it because it is the best show on TV, hands down!!!<br />Every episode feels like it was just 10 mins long because it goes so fast and you always want more. Most of the time I am left sitting there with my mouth hanging open or screaming \\"OMG\\" at the TV....hahhahha.  Am sorry this is the last season, I will really miss it. The main thing is....this show is an example of what TV can be, the acting, the writing, it's all there. It makes you wonder why more shows can't have this level of talent and it certainly sours me to alot of TV that is out there. Enjoy!!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is engaging, but frustrating to play as it is sized too large for my screen.  With larger grids, entire rows are unreachable off the right side of the screen, rendering the grids unplayable.  Hopefully this will be fixed in an update.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the hype I thought I was going to read something that I would truly enjoy.  I did not.  There was nothing to this book other than S & M and a girl that was so far fetched I could barely get through book one.  I was looking for something to excite me and this was not it.
1401937519|5.0|What a book!  I would recommend this page-turner to anyone, even those without health concerns.  Moorjani's story is about her difficulty growing up in Hong Kong as an Indian, about her challenges navigating her childhood and teen years with conservative Hindu parents in a westernized culture, and her hope to please others amid conflicting rules and lifestyles.<br /><br />It is understandable, then, that all these external conflicts would lead to the inner turmoil and fear that would eventually manifest as cancer.  She was sick for a number of years and throughout continued to do research and attempt to follow various Eastern and Western regimens.  For several months, she lived in India and followed Ayurvedic practices.  However, when she returned to her home in Hong Kong, she faced differing opinions and feedback about this approach among her friends and colleagues.<br /><br />This lead to a continuation of the pull from different directions to be different than she was - a continuation of the mixed messages that she received growing up in Hong Kong.  Her illness then took a nose dive until she ended up in the hospital with her husband and mother where she eventually went into a coma.  Her doctors informed her family that she had just hours to live.  It was during the coma that she experienced what is known as an NDE, a near-death experience.  What she learned during that experience has enabled her to share deep universal truths about what it means to be human from the soul's perspective.<br /><br />Moorjani was given the opportunity to return and re-inhabit her weak body.  When she did so, she immediately came out of her coma and recovered from her illness so quickly that she shocked her doctors.  Apparently, only several people as sick as Moorjani have ever come out of a coma and recovered well enough to return to normal life.<br /><br />Although the story is compelling, what any reader will walk away with is a renewed sense of how each of us is so utterly drivenby fear on some level.  Moorjani's story shows how the fear and inner conflict that was part of her history created her illness.  However, she is quick to say that this was the cause of her disease and not necessarily the cause of others' serious illness.  She helps each of us see how we are all connected to one another and how living fearlessly and authentically is the way we were meant to live.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The only description needed is perfect. Other than the Godfather 3. But even that is greater than any average movie, especially ones nowadays. Definitely worth every cent and more.
0446672653|4.0|I was very pleased with the ordering and timing of receiving the order...thank you!  I haven't actually read he book yet to give a review of it, but am sure after reading the excerpts that it will be as good as anticipate.
0099579936|2.0|I fell into all the hype and jumped on the \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" bandwagon. I'd heard it described as \\"sexy\\", \\"different\\", and \\"erotic.\\" I thought I'd give it a go. After all, how bad could it be? Well, I decided to make a list.<br /><br />1. Does Christian (Mr. Grey? Sir?) ever work? He spends the entirety of the novel stalking Ana (Anastasia? Miss Steele?), having sex with Ana, emailing/texting Ana, or buying expensive things for Ana. How is he a BILLIONARE (not millionare, BILLIONARE), again?<br />2. The eye rolling and lip biting. A good chunk of this novel is spent lip biting, eye rolling, muttering and murmuring.<br />3. There were a couple of passable sex scenes. Ana has an orgasm each and every time they have sex (which is usually 2-3 times in a matter of 30 minutes). And each orgasm is described in a very similar fashion. She orgasms at the drop of a hat (or, at the sound of her name), and then Christian follows suit.<br />4. I feel like this particular sex scene deserved it's own space. Christian PULLS ANA'S TAMPON OUT OF HER then has sex with her. Really?! REALLY?! I was almost in tears LAUGHING by the time that scene was over. NOT sexy at all.<br /><br />...the editor was really, really not paying attention.
B005ZUR724|5.0|they did a really good job making this game! It is very addictive and fun to play with other players!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I am 90 years old and the book covered the presidents that I knew.  However it told a part of their history that I did not know and was fascinating.  Nixon in particular.  Despite the scandal, he was important during many of the other presidents tenure.  Hoover helping with hunger after world war 2 surprised me. I looked forward to each chapter and was not disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it this game its hard at times but fun and sometimes aggravating but I keep going back until I pass it and get a next level
B000TERK3C|5.0|I had just been getting into Radiohead when I bought this album, and really love it.  It's not like their later stuff, which is darker and more digital, but nonetheless an integral and coherent part of their narrative which spans all the early albums.  As many say, this is by far Radiohead's most accessible album, and the apogee of their guitar-driven period.  Strongly recommended.
B004J09ONG|5.0|The story behind the movie is truly remarkable. The movie is beautiful and moving. I loved it as a child (~30 years ago) and loved it as much when watching it again with my son.<br />Read the story behind the movie and the personal stories of Joy and George Adamson.
B0086700CM|5.0|so about a week ago my bro. kept saying get this and I just kept saying shut up until my neighbor and best friend ever said get it now! so I got and its great its not really an addictive game but it sure is fun!!!
B008577DT6|5.0|I must start this off by letting you all know this-This episode didn't air on DISH sat.  So if not for you, I wouldn't have seen this episode-ever! Maybe even never ever...!!! I would have missed out bigtime!  House and his merry minions were able to actually be themselves; not a character they portray. House has (in real life), an english accent! Boy, in a sense I almost feel closure. Very ingenuitive way of ending a killer tv show!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|ok so I love this game but time to time it wouldn't let me get on or it freezes.also you are gonna have to gt used to the old version because its been a while and amazon still didn't make an update for it witch kind of ticks me off. so amazon or the creators of draw something please fix this or you are going to lose your popularity to the kindle fire users
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cant take it away. its really really fun. even my mom and dad cant take it away from them
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|We loved this movie!  It has been a very long time since we have seen a great scary movie.  The story line keeps you guessing all the way till the end. And, on the edge of your seat.  Daniel Radcliff was superb.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Brilliant! Nuanced, layered, mature, with beautiful lyrics throughout. This album has basically no weak(er) songs, but remains interesting throughout. The first time listening to \\"Hot Butter\\" was one of those rare moments of musical bliss. Well worth the wait!
1401216676|5.0|In a sea of other wonderful Batman stories, I my money is on this as the best one off story about the bat.  The artwork is beautiful and the story is perfect.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game! its soooo addictive and its great for anyone! a great thinking game that improves both stradegy, and fun!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I loved reading Edgar Rice Burroughs when I was younger and especially loved two of his series - Tarzan and the Barsoom series.  These books transported me to faraway places that I would never see and I imagined myself as Jane or the princess of Mars or other characters in his MANY books.  I am an avid reader and luckily Burroughs was a prolific writer.  His books allowed me the ultimate escapism onto exotic worlds.<br /><br />\\"John Carter,\\" the movie, is an amalgamation of his Barsoom series ([[ASIN:B007YIZ4NE Barsoom Series Complete Collection]], especially [[ASIN:1466493283 A Princess of Mars]].<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch is perfect for the lead role, playing handsome but a little goofy, and Lynn Collins as Dejah Thoris, princess of Mars is a beautiful, strong womanoid.<br /><br />Best of all, though, were the special effects.  Three separate intelligent species on Mars plus the animal/monster life plus the steampunk feel of their transportation made for a hugely enjoyable movie for me.  It brought back so many memories of summer afternoons under the cottonwood trees on my grandparent's farm, reading all of Burrough's adventures, and creating my own mind pictures of how I imagined Mars (Jasoom) to look.  Great fun!
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I bought is through Amazon, it was Sold by: XSRS LLC, it now has another seller. I received it around 7/13/2012. I tried to charge it immediately, when plugged the cable in the computer to charge, the E6 had a purple light. The user manual does not say what indicates a full charge. I asked the FIIO service about it, they said:\\"Please pay attention, if you find it shows purple color, it means it is working and charging at the same time, please  Turn switch to derection of upward for 3 seconds or above, till the purple color turns to red color. If it is only red color ,it means it is charging, after you charging it fully , the red light will turn off, hope you can understand ,thanks.\\"<br /> However, after more than one day on charging, the light did not go out, when I push the switch upward for 3 seconds, the light turned red for a second, then turned to blinking red, later, I found out that it means the battery was bad. According the FIIO, normally, it takes only  1 1/2 hour to charge.<br /><br />I am going to return it.
030758836X|5.0|I loved Gillian Flynn's first two novels - [[ASIN:0307341550 Sharp Objects]] and [[ASIN:0307341577 Dark Places]].  When I first started reading \\"Gone Girl,\\" I thought it was going to be a more conventional murder mystery and I was disappointed.  I shouldn't have been.<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" ends up having just as many twists and turns as Flynn's previous novels.  And I thought I had a dysfunctional family?  Wait until you read about Nick and Amy Dunne.<br /><br />The evidence is mounting that Nick Dunne did away with his wife.  Did he? This book will keep you guessing (just like Flynn's others) until the very (disturbing) end.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Seems like you can only have sex so often and telling each other how much you love one another.  Not sure about the third installment.
B008K8U13K|3.0|can you save it if yes I will by it and does it work with Kindle Fire? please someone comment please? I would appreciate it. Thanks so much.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|I am 61 years old and have spent over 40 years standing on my feet for a living.  Plantar fasciitis and  neuropathy issues in both feet.  These sandals are the most comfortable things I can wear on my feet and walk.  Size was just a bit on the large size but a comfortable loose fit.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting!! I love it and I can not put it down!! They should make a Temple Run 2!!!
0894803123|2.0|I love Ben & Jerry....but this book doesn't cut it. I wish it did. There are better master recipes out there to add the flavour combinations to.
B005HEQTVS|5.0|This is the show at its best. The sense of drama and conflict in this episode is very strong, with humor where needed (see Worf's music request). Watching the two episodes of this story, I can't help but feel, if only the entire series was a continuous storyline instead of great episodes interspersed with some less good ones. Unfortunately, TV at the time had not really gotten into continuous story threads yet (aside from soap operas), and Star Trek would have to wait until DS9 for it.
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|I'm a big Tarantino fan, and I was missing this one. For 10 bucks it's a steal! Great quality as usual for a blu ray movie, and besides you get a dvd copy just in case, won't do you no harm to get that for free, right?
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game because its not like simcity where you have to be playing for stuff to happen on this you can turn it off and still make money
B005HSL626|3.0|So this app used to act perfectly and I was having a mort of fun with it but then all of a sudden it just like stopped working. Everytime I try to open it all I get is a black screen before it goes back to my home screen. Its frustrating.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Based on all the current reviews for this book, I had extremely high hopes.  I usually agree with the majority of books reads that are rated so highly but this was a complete let down!  What twist was I supposed to be looking for?  Where was I supposed to be drawn in to this novel?  I kept reading b/c I just knew that something great was gonna happen...but not so much.  I was ticked for having to have read 50% of the book till one major event led towards the end.  Thinking that SOMETHING great was coming at the finale...nope.  Totally disappointed read.  What am I missing that everyone else seemed to find in the book?
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It's a 100/100 movie delivers in every way possible. I watched it twice in theater and it feels really short when it's really 2 and a half hrs. All the characters are in it equally, nobody is in a backseat really. Iron man was my favorite in it obviously and robert downey jr's acting was also brilliant. Highly recommend this to any comic fan/superhero fan/movie fan in general everyone will like it.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Humorous and entertaining. A nice little amount of sexiness and romance to keep it interesting, but not vulgar. I can't wait to read the next book and learn more about the continuing journey of Rose and her boyfriend, Joe.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|awful game takes up too much memory and takes too long to get leveled up. I would recommend not even buying the game and don't even hesitate.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|With all the recent hype surrounding Frank Ocean, I hoped his debut album would deliver. I needn't have feared, \\"Channel Orange\\" more than lives up to the hype; avant garde, yet still accessible<br /><br />A brief synth intro \\"Start\\" does just that (a piece titled \\"End\\" closes it), before we get to the spare moody synth ballad \\"Thinkin' `Bout You\\" which finds him switching from lower register to falsetto in the blink of an eye. \\"Sierra Leone\\" is a trippy echoey spoken/sung number which reminds one of Shuggie Otis. The groovy piano-sprinkled \\"Sweet Life\\" recalls Musiq Soulchild in places. The plodding \\"Super Rich Kids\\" is set to a beat/riff similar to Elton John's \\"Bernie And The Jets\\" with Marvin Gaye-style harmonies and lyrics taking a look at the hedonistic lifestyle of rich kids. \\"Too many joyrides in Daddy's Jaguar\\" he sings before declaring \\"I'm looking for a real love\\".<br /><br />\\"Pilot Jones\\" is a spare hazy number set to finger snaps.\\"Crack Rock\\" tells of the hazards of cocaine use, while the epic 10 minute \\"Pyramids\\" is a multi-part tempo-shifting masterpiece with a John Mayer guitar solo and lyrics about time travelling from ancient Egypt to Las Vegas. Mayer also appears on the brief Jazzy instrumental interlude \\"White\\". \\"Lost\\" is chugging Pop with a tinge of Rock, \\"Monks\\" is a free form Soul/Jazz piece, the organ-laced sweeping ballad \\"Bad Religion\\" evokes Stevie Wonder (\\"I can never make him love me... It's a bad religion to be in love with someone who can never love you\\" he sings), while \\"Forrest Gump\\" features some nice Blues guitar.<br /><br />My favourite is the tender ballad \\"Pink Matter\\" which starts off stripped, with bass and beats coming in halfway, Andr&eacute; 3000 giving a spit fire bridge, soft guitar twangs, and heart rending vocals from Ocean.<br /><br />Every once in a while, an artist arrives who changes the rules of the game. Frank Ocean is one of such. A Masterpiece!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I liked this book far more than I expected to, although I don't know if my pain state at the time of reading influences my taste. I found the book to be at least as serious as it was funny. I still hadn't expected to like it in the beginning (something about it initially reminded me of a series I generally dislike), but it improved quickly and got me hooked. It didn't seem as much a romance as it is advertised to be (I don't go for romances generally).<br /><br />My pain state probably contributed to my getting emotional when the main character had a major life upset. A book worth reading.<br /><br />I should mention that I don't see it as a mystery. At least not a cozy like I often read, because she doesn't try to figure it out.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very addicting and calming. I enjoy playing this and have no problems with the game. I cant wait until they make more games
B007N85POS|4.0|this game is fun like all angry birds games but i miss the pigs,they actually made the game fun in my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|a definite must read. a guidebook to life. a light to guide our journey on the path of life.<br />essential information. and available in so many versions
B004RJMUJO|5.0|it is very fun and keeps me busy when i'm bored. my high score right now is like 70 or something.<br />WARNING:<br />VERY ADDICTING
B003SCMHH6|5.0|After finishing my Queen's collection, it seemed the next choice for a 70's musician. It sounds as immature as Queen's first  LP but the basics are there.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is my first Bible app and I am very happy with it.  it is easy to use and find things and switch between versions.  I gave it 4 not 5 stars because there were a couple of versions it doesn't have but there are a lot.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Dev must be real desperate to arrange for such a large number of FAKE reviews. I've read about marketing companies that do this, but this must be a pretty bad one since their fake reviews are so transparent.<br /><br />As for the game itself, it's nothing special. It's a connect the dots puzzle. There are several out there that are exactly the same thing, nany of which are a lot better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Hard to believe that something so useful for walking daily with the Lord would be free, but it is! It's not comprehensive like a study Bible, but has lots of great features. The Bible reading plans are great and you can read them in any of the variety of versions available. Love that you can also download many versions for offline use too!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Solitaire is an excellent touch screen game and this one is clear, smooth and the ads are not overwhelming or intrusive. The only fault is the upper edge touch often grabs the underlieing screen which is easily recovered.<br />Well done.!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to use.  While on the road it's good to have something like this that is reliable.  Hate it when I'm late getting to where I'm supposed to be, and this app helps prevent that.
B0086700CM|5.0|glad they have it on here!!!! its addicting &amp; works fine on my kindle fire. I hope they put more fun apps on here soon :)
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My Children enjoy playing this game together with their siblings and neighbors. I know that this is un-scientific, just it appears that they really enjoy this game.
B008CJ0KI8|4.0|There are already 22 reviews on here (and doubtlessly more coming) discussing this artists sexuality, bravery, innovation etc and i'm going to try my level best not to add another hum-drum write up obsessing over all the familiar bases. instead i'll try to focus extensively on how much i've enjoyed listening to this above any questions as to whether Mr Ocean is in fact the most talented member of Odd Future, the saviour of R&B, or potentially the best singer songwriter of this up and coming generation.<br /><br />Channel Orange is said by some to be a loose concept album of a twentysomethings experience of living in LA, juxtaposing the glamour and the debauchery that runs through the heart of the cities wealthy inhabitants. In truth i think it's much closer to a collection of quasi love songs that are segued with clever observations and insights into our protaganists area of residence. As i'm sure you already know this is largely an R&B or as some prefer \\"Neo Soul\\" album, however it's not a typical one persay featuring more left of field instrumentation with old school charm; you can hear funky keyboards, sytnhesizers, soft rock drumming and abstract interludes throughout the 17 tracks on here.<br /><br />Which brings me serendipitously to \\"Pyrimaids\\" easily the most ambitious song on channel Orange, featuring a suite of constantly changing ideas that range from boom bap soul to synthy psychedelia with enviable ease. It's scope is a little like Kanye's similarly impressive Runaway from MBDTF. My personal favourites though are \\"Super Rich Kids\\" and \\"Bad Religion\\" the former featuring an inspired verse from the previously AWOL wonderkind rapper Earl and Frank Ocean's astutely disparaging lyrics detailing the disillusioned perceptions of the rich youth of Los angeles. Many have made comparisons to the characters in Bret Easton Ellis's first masterpiece Less Than Zero and i'd be suprised if Frank Ocean didn't take some inspirtaion from it.<br /><br />\\"Bad Religion\\" is atouching ballad about his unrequited love for another man that features his most breathtaking vocals especially during the plaintive line \\"I could never make him love me\\". I can't quite agree with the vast majority of the reviews i've read about this being flawless i'm afraid, even though I enjoyed almost everything on Channel Orange i found some of the interludes superfluous and \\"Pilot Jones\\" and \\"Thinking About You\\" just a little too saccharin. Nevertheless, this is obviously an impressive collection of songs that deserve most of the considerable praise afforded to them.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great reading, wonderful complicated characters, super story line. Loaded the books into my Kindle in seconds and did not put it down. Went from one book to another smoothly.<br /><br />While reading you become one with the story teller.  As a woman I appreciated the books as you could relate to the main character 'Ana' and feel it all with her.  As a woman who has loved this deeply you feel one with her. The descriptive sex is not offensive at all, as it is written with great feeling.  Who hasn't been there or would like to be.<br /><br />In summary reading these books is a great life experience.

0061122416|2.0|I was required to read this book as a summer assignment for an English Honors class, from the reviews I read on the back of the book and the international praise the author had described about the book in the introduction, I'd already suspected a bit of pretentiousness. I had some hope and willingness as I began to read the first pages, but what followed was a cluster of repeated phrases, and depth-less characters that are impossible to connect with. Spoilers will follow, but I do not recommend you read this book at all.<br /><br />The story is basically about a young Shepard named Santiago who has dreams of Pyramids in the desert, and he wants to figure out the meaning, so he goes to this gypsy woman who speaks of treasure... That's the basis we're going on in this story. Along the way he meets some more hollow characters, an old king who tells Santiago to not give up and follow omens. An entire section around a crystal merchant who did not achieve his \\"Personal Legend,\\" but helps Santiago anyways and makes him understand that he can learn a lot of information from things... An Englishman who gives Santiago little hints toward the Alchemist, and the Alchemist... A 200 year old sorcerer who rephrases everything the old king said and makes Santiago's journey as easy as possible. Santiago starts talking to his heart to find out what his next step should be... He also meets Fatima, who is a shameless attempt to recreate \\"love at first sight\\" that is poorly executed and ultimately sexist. In fact, the entire book is based around men following their dreams, and treats women as pets who are supposed to \\"await their men as they pursue their dreams.\\" There are no plot twists or anything exciting going on throughout. I found myself cringing at the stale and redundant language used and was unable to read more than 5 pages at a time.<br /><br />The plot, characters, theme, and overall taste of this book is as simple and unchallenged as it can get. There's no back story or anydescription of the few characters that are even important in this book. Maybe it was the translator's fault in bringing the language of the original version, but I doubt that. The only props I give to this book is the fact that it will provide SOME entertainment to new readers who aren't seeking anything deep or challenging. But for me, this book was a huge waste of time and did not \\"change my life forever...\\"
B007T7MIR0|1.0|Out of alot of products ,i have found that this is the worst .it different, it would constantly freeze and lockup
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns, not able to put it down and not predictable like so many murder mysteries are. I am not a fan of the ending but had fun reading it regardless of the finale.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I was a little afraid to buy this album after hearing the snippets on amazonmp3 but I bought it anyway (from Best Buy). All I must say is this is pretty much the album of 2012! It has amazing songwriting from Mrs. Grant, soothing vocals, and a song for anyone. Every song is amazing and what are you reading my review for? GET THIS ALBUM NOW! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!
0345803493|5.0|Loved it ! Wish there were more ! I have read all three and I could go on forever ! I am having a hard time getting \\"into\\" another book !
B006P3HXZG|4.0|This is a great 3D movie to add to your collection. I really enjoyed this one with my son. Many reviewers have recommended RIO and Ice Age but I thought the quality of the 3D was much better in this movie. Not to mention the movie was very fun and enjoyable for adults and children. Hopefully future 3D movies that come out on bluray will emulate the quality of this one!!!
0345803485|5.0|I could not put it down ! I loved it and am at a loss finding something as good !
B007J4T2G8|1.0|While I admire the tenacity an author puts into creating their book, I could not help but to review this one with only one star. As I listen to the hype about this book, I continously say to myself, \\"I don't get it\\". I read the book on a recommendation from a co-worker prior to the social media hype. I found the writing style to be rather generic. If it were not for the explicit sex scenes in the book, I would have swore that I was reading a teen genre book. I could not bring myself to purchase the rest of the series primarily due to the repetition. If I had to read one more time that Christian ran his fingers through his hair (all I could think is, this guy is going to be bald by the time he reaches sixty if he doesn't stop playing with his hair) and that he smelled like his scent and his body wash, I was going to pull my own hair out. I think there are far more books out there that deserve more attention.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|The Fae series is completely addictive! The first book of the series took a bit to get into, but watch out when the \\"groove\\" of the book kicks in for you. You will not sleep for however long it takes you to finish this series. I have many family and friends who I recommended the series to who are still mad at me for their lack of sleep. The writing is just descriptive enough to take you into the world of the book, but not overwhelming to become monotonous.
0345803493|5.0|Nice set of books.  Very extremely descriptive, imaginative and erotic.  too sexy for me though lol.  too much information for younger readers.
0307477479|2.0|I too disliked all of the characters and found myself wondering if I should abandon the book.  This book is trying to hard to be cool, especially the Powerpoint chapter.  Puh-leeze!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Let's just get this straight- I don't like science fiction. I have heard of star wars and star trek, have maybe seen one or two of them. I have never made it far into any science fiction book. I don't like post armageddon, I am far too sensitive for it in my old (50) age.  Hate action, suspense and fantasy... except what goes on in my own head.<br /><br />  I do love to read indie authors. I read everything published by anyone in my little community (Fort Bragg California- i.e. Norma Watkins, Ginny Rorby, Fauna Perkins, Charlie Fury...).<br />  Like the masses here on Amazon,  I downloaded the Wool Omnibus to my iPad kindle.  A few weeks later I finished whatever I was reading and perused my library. I started Wool, thinking it might be about New Zealand sheep farming.<br /><br />  Hooked in like I have NEVER been hooked into a book. Could not stop talking about it. Devoured it, read first shift. read hurricane, read plagiarist...downloaded molly fyde (ok, having a bit of trouble with it as it is spacey and science fictiony)... now re reading Wool. I am just as addicted this time around. Reading the details I missed before.  I have purchased hard copies for my household. I check his website daily to see how he is getting on with Second shift and wool 21, 22, 23.... considering hiring people to mow his lawn so he can keep writing.<br /><br />  Read this book. Buy it for your friends. Friend Hugh on Facebook. Bookmark his website. Wool.
B0001O3YD0|3.0|Very Dark picture to match its title. A story of those in cybersleep who wake up to their ship going out of control. Rushing to controls, trying to save the sleeping fugitives who await unknown possibilities and adventures. Help they scream out as the ship plummets into outer space. They are saved I don't know who Owens is but he saved those passengers. They hit the new planet with flying blackish birds they could look like huge cormarants. They try and some do make it, rebuilding the exisiting dumping ground space machines with cells they find. The things I liked. I like the female lead, I think she is very pretty and strong looking, plus I think she is a good actress. She does a good job in all films she is in. I would like to look this strong. She is the captain and struggles to keep her plan. I like flying to space planets and meeting the strange creatures and exiciting possibilites. The birds dripped blue blood from the many sun filled atmosphere, an eclipse comes bringing them out of hiding to eat the stranded. Help again, finding a solution so they can move on to ever more feats of strength and hope of happiness in each of their neverending experiences.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|If you're into crude rude and nasty humor ( and who isn't?) than this movie is for you!  Nothing can ever live up to the first Hangover, but it does a good job trying!  Mr. Chow is the best in this installment!
B00338QENI|3.0|I knew what Jim Crow laws were, but this was a very vivid history of their impact on a specific life and local culture. The story of HeLa cells, which I have grown in the lab, is interesting in itself. Long before patient confidentiality was a priority, H. L.'s doctor protected her identity even as the cell line became widely used, a responsible act which author does not give him enough credit for, even seems to criticize. Finally, the author argues that when scientists can produce something from tumor tissue that can be useful, there ought to be a bureaucracy that gives the passive \\"donor\\" a royalty relationship if cells are ever sold. A questionable practice that would offshore a number of scientific operations, an alternative that the author does not even address. So its history, science and a political argument - maybe something for everyone.
B007FZ7R7W|4.0|This is not Chris Brown best work however, I would recommend this album some great workout music.<br />Many songs on this album will become classics.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered this Kindle charger cord after two cords purchased some years ago literally fell apart (with the insulation cracking and coming off, leaving exposed wiring).  After reading posts from other Kindle users who had the same problem I contacted Amazon Customer Support.  They sent me two of these new cords (to replace my originals) and everything was free, including shipping/handling.  So far the cord has been great, and I am very happy with Amazon customer service as they admitted there was a problem and did the right thing.  If you have one of the older cords and it falls apart, just contact Customer Service and they will help you.
B008ENNXQI|1.0|This movie had very little of the story's original plot. The most obvious change was  making Snow White the \\"Hero\\" of the story and making the prince a weak man who needed a woman to save him instead of the other way around. Sure, young girls should be encouraged to have confidence, but this movie is clearly trying to teach them that they don't need a man for anything. Maybe some would call me old fashioned, but I prefer a story where the hero is a man!
0956251579|5.0|Great, great book!! You know it's a good book when everyday interruptions make you furious for interfering with your reading time. :)<br />In the beginning, i wasn't sure if i was going to like the time change so often, but I can't imagine the book being written any other way now that I'm finished. I loved the details also. Very descriptive, in the good and the bad scenarios. I can guarantee you won't regret this reading. Enjoy :)

B007I2BZIE|2.0|Well its official, Rush cannot make a good album without Terry Brown.  Now it didn't take 30 years for me to realize this.<br /><br />It just took that long to accept it.<br /><br />Grace Under Pressure was the first album without Terry Brown followed by Power Windows.  Even though they radically changed their sound, all of the properties of a typical Rush song (catchy melodies, instrumental virtousity, compelling lyrics, etc) were still there.  The formula was intact and still worked despite the Tears for Fears package it was being delivered in.<br /><br />Then came Hold Your Fire.  For the first time, I found myself fast forwarding my way through a Rush album.  Was this a joke?  What was this glossy, effeminate sound coming out of my speakers?  It's as if they strategically decided not to write any memorable riffs or melodies and instead create new-agey soundscapes that Geddy would just sing over.  I thought I was listening to the Thompson Twins minus the melody.<br /><br />Hold Your Fire was for me, and probably many Rush fans, the poison pill they would never overcome.  Every album since has always been hyped as the \\"Rush return's to its roots\\" record.  All of them failed.  The Rupert Hine releases (Presto and Roll the Bones) phased out the keyboards, but were mind-numbingly laid back, hollow sounding records.  Rush then tried to get their swagger back by going grunge with Counterparts and Test for Echo.  Unfortunately, clean and sober guys in their mid 40's singing about finding their feminine side is a hard formula to sell as a grunge record - no matter how loud you turn up your guitar volume.<br /><br />At the end of the 90's, my enthusiasm for Rush remained intact despite this bizarre metamorphosis.  A quick trip to Xanadu or La Villa Strangiato was always a good remedy to abominations like Tai Shan, Second Nature, and Anagram. I was still delusionaly positive.  \\"It's a good album, but not quite Moving Pictures of course\\" was how I described Presto.  Surelythe band that recorded Hemispheres would someday make a record that I didn't have to hide from my friends.<br /><br />I remember back in college trying to get my roommate into Rush.  I played the Exit Stage Left concert video for him confident that once he heard the middle section of Freewill or the live By-Tor and the Snow Dog guitar-bass battle, he would be hooked.  He was intrigued - then Roll the Bones was released.  As soon as he heard Face Up, he was done.  How could I blame him?<br /><br />But I still held out hope my favorite band would one day make an album I could be proud of.<br /><br />Then came Vapor Trails and Snakes and Arrows with the proverbial \\"Rush return's to its roots\\" pre-release hype.  Unfortunately, that meant a change in production and sound, not songwriting....and it wasn't for the better.  Alex was still in soundscape mode, but instead of dreamy ethereal atmospheres (what fanboi's call \\"textures\\" or \\"colors\\"), was now a wall of noise assault, void of any intricate playing or memorable riffs.  Geddy's annoying addiction to layering his voice only got worse.  Furthermore, Ged doesn't even try to write a vocal melody anymore.  Their songwriting formula became:<br /><br />Step 1:  Write a bunch of small instrumental parts<br />Step 2:  Cut and paste them together to form songs<br />Step 3:  Get the lyric sheet from Neil and sing over top of them<br /><br />There was no natural flow between verse and chorus.  The lyrical \\"melody\\" often clashed with the \\"melody\\" of the music.<br /><br />So after Snakes and Arrows, I finally came to grips that Rush was no longer capable or interested in making a good album.  In retrospect, I secretly felt that way after Roll the Bones.  But I, like many other Rush fans, would never dare express it.<br /><br />Does Clockwork Angels change that?  Nope.<br /><br />The obvious weakness of Rush's songwriting formula is vocal melody.  For example, in Caravan, the \\"Caravan Carries Me Over\\" line is completely out of place from what is going on musically.  It's the musical equivalent of wearing a paisley shirt with plaid pants.  It's understandable how this occurs since Alex and Geddy write the songs independently from Neil.  Sometimes it's obvious that Neil's lyrics are just sprayed over top at the last minute.  Fortunately, it isn't as prevalent as it is on Snakes and Arrows, an album totally void of Melody, but it does still occur.  Sometimes to compensate, Geddy over-sings in places where subtlety would work much better.  The title track and \\"Carnies\\" feature a plate of uber-vibrato and overdubs that are difficult to stomach.  On the bright side, at least there are no cringe inducing \\"whoa whoahs\\" this time.<br /><br />One frustrating aspect carried over from Snakes and Arrows are the solos, or lack thereof.  Remember how Far Cry was ripe for a ripping Alex Lifeson solo?  But instead...yup you guessed it, more sonic soundscaping.  This happens on Clockwork also.  BU2B sets you up for a real face melter, however we are treated to lazy harmonic atmospherics from Alex.  Seven Cities of Gold leaves you hanging as well.<br /><br />The poor production quality is very well documented.  Rush is a band who's forte is playing their instruments.  The wall of noise production style serves a band like Tool or Deftones well.  They don't really play their instruments, they make sounds with them. But drowning the greatest power trio of all time in it should be a crime.  You have to really strain to hear any intricate playing going on.<br /><br />On the positive side, there is more songwriting cohesion than on Snakes and Arrows, but thats not saying much.  The Anarchist is probably the best song they've had in years.  The memorable guitar riffs, catchiness, and vocal melody all shine through here.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels is not a heinous album in the Hold Your Fire mold.  One could argue that it's the best of their worst albums, which is everything post Power Windows.  So if Moving Picturesis the 5 star pinnacle of all Rush albums, and other Rush staple albums such as Hemispheres and 2112 are 4 stars, then that makes Clockwork Angels a 2 star album at best.  Any more is just delusional.  Is this album on par with Permanent Waves or AFTK?  Hell no.  The 5 star reviews are just laughable.  Notice most of them claim you have to listen to this record 10 times in order to begin to understand its \\"greatness\\".  Translation:  You have to listen to this record 10 times in order to convince yourself that it is any good.<br /><br />That's how I felt after Test for Echo.  Not anymore.<br /><br />So after 30 years, why can't Rush make anything close to what they made in the 70's and early 80's?  The answer is Terry Brown.  It makes you wonder what Rush would have been without him.  More interestingly, it makes you wonder what Rush could have been if they had kept him.  Imagine Power Windows produced under Terry Brown.  Wow!  Instead, Rush hired producers that gave them way too much rope to hang themselves with.  Terry Brown would never let a song like Dog Years get on a Rush album.  Even Geddy now admits Tai Shan was a big mistake and they \\"should of known better\\".  Terry Brown understood that 3 amazing players like this needed separation and definition, not sheer volume.  But at the same time, songwriting was just as important as instrumental acrobatics.  Songs like Freewill and Red Barchetta are technically dynamic, yet catchy and singable.  The first time you heard Closer to the Heart, Tom Sawyer, Fly By Night, or Limelight, it stuck....because they were good songs. You didn't have to listen to them 10 times in order to \\"get it\\".  In fact, it would be challenging to sit down with an acoustic guitar and play a lot of their current material because it could not stand out on its own.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that before the guys call it a day, they bring back Terry Brown for at least one album.<br /><br />Oh...and hey guys...when you go on tour in support of it....for god's sake, please leave the fat suits, washer and dryers, and chicken roasters back in Toronto.

B00005QZWI|3.0|I sampled the music, and after seeing a poll where FM listeners voted this best soundtrack of all time, I figured how could I go wrong? I did.<br /><br />It's not bad, and I'm probably generous with three stars (probably should have given it two) - the 'hook' is good (the main melody that 'bout all soundtracks hit you with six different ways), but to me a lot of the music just doesn't stand on its own. No doubt it's great music while watching the movie (which I've never seen), but by itself, and voted top soundtrack of all time?<br /><br />Off the top of my head I can think of a number of (overlooked) soundtracks that are better for pure listening (the music stands on its own).

B0031RAOVY|4.0|If you're as nuts over dogs as I am, Lasse Hallstrom's \\"Hachi: A Dog's Tale\\" is a must-see. Be sure, however, that you've stocked up on Kleenex in advance.<br /><br />\\"Hachi\\" is based on a true story that is known to every Japanese schoolchild. Transposed to modern-day New England, it is the story of an Akita puppy, lost in transit from Japan to a new owner in America, who is found and rescued in a train station by a music professor (Richard Gere). Over the initial opposition of the professor's wife (Joan Allen), Hachi moves into the professor's home, and he and the professor become inseparable. Hachi accompanies the professor as he walks to the station to catch the train to work, and is always there to greet him when he returns home.<br /><br />The mostly expository first hour of \\"Hachi\\" is pleasant enough but slightly dull, except for the sequences in which the action is shown through Hachi's eyes. Frankly, I don't find Richard Gere a terribly interesting actor when he's not playing a viilain or a con man, and here, of course, he's a sweetheart. But that doesn't matter in the end, because \\"Hachi\\" really is the dog's tale, and Hachi--or, more to the point, the various Akitas who play Hachi as a puppy, an adult dog, and finally an old dog--is the true star. Furthermore, the first hour is vital to setting up the final half-hour, when the story--now fully focused on Hachi--achieves sublimity. If you're a firm believer in the love and loyalty of dogs--or even if you aren't--the last half-hour of \\"Hachi\\" will move you to the core of your being.<br /><br />I only hope \\"Hachi\\" doesn't motivate novice or unprepared dog owners to buy an Akita. If the \\"making-of\\" documentary on this DVD doesn't give you the hint, every book and TV program on Akitas will: Akitas are proud, stubborn, fiercely loyal dogs that regard anyone outside the immediate family as an interloper. Having an Akita in your house is like having a samurai in your house, and I mean a samurai who is half-wolf. But the Akitas in \\"Hachi\\" are magnficent dogs by any standard. If you have the guts to train an Akita, you will make by far the best friend you will ever have.ut the Akitas in \\"Hachi\\" are magnficent dogs by any standard.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|First things first. You should buy this book. Every reviewer intends to buy the next book in this series because it is original and the storytelling is compelling.  I don' t do a lot of rating but what I do rate  I bought and own. This author deserves your purchase because this kind of talent should be encouraged. Apparently this is his first novel and it blows me away that it is. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the plot and the whole imaginative concept. While the few criticisms are valid I would add to their comments a reminder that this is an indie book that is costing you little to try. Price is not the point but rather that the author is not supported by the publisher editing that you pay for. He may not yet be on a par with Sanderson or Rothfuss but he is on par with whoever you think is behind them. I want more books like he writes. I think you will love this book and be anxiously waiting for the next one like I am.
B006RUJST6|3.0|I typically utilize the 'customer review' portion to gauge a choice in purchasing items, however, very few times do I write one. This book however deserves five stars as much as it deserves 2 stars.<br />This story is listed as a young adult and romance? This story only utilizes the young lady and gent as a platform for the actual story. The author has written the reader a story about living life, following your heart, never giving up and everything in between. I enjoyed the writing style with the Avett Brothers and their philosophies which are profound and also sets the tone for each chapter. It provides some depth for those of you who read a story to understand what the author wants you see beyond the surface. This is not a romance novel, it is simply a story of life and how we are remembered. Live each day for death is apparent and all we are left with is our memory so how will you be remembered? So in this regard, and maybe the most important point is there are no points, only a new eye to see with, only life. And this is why I rate it at 5 stars.<br />From the reader and critic perspective, this author gets 2 stars on character development and lack luster on overall development of true human emotion. Since this story is rather deep and real, it does lack a bit of reality of how the human race tends to deal with loss. If we all accepted loss in the ways she writes, there may never be a challenge. I felt the heroine, Lake, being a teenager, would have needed more time to deal with losing a parent in a way that was destructive. It all seemed too accepted too easily which made it a little less believable to me. Will, the hero, was likable also and has a strong character but the romance between the two of them never grabbed me, there was no true build up and happened entirely too quickly. This author however, story be it told, hits home on what the real meaning is and that the points isn't the point. Worth the read, don't take everyone's word for it.

B0085KGHI6|4.0|It's my understanding that this classic collaboration has been on the bootleg circuit for some time.  This is an authorized release by Eagle Vision.  The Checkerboard was a Southside juke joint owned by Chicago blues legend Buddy Guy (who also makes an appearance in a white suit and giant Afro).  The headliner was Mississippi blues god, Muddy Waters and his band.<br /><br />After a couple songs led by piano man Lovie Lee, Waters takes charge and whips through some electric blues that he helped launch.  The grainy home movie style camera work shows a mostly empty long table in front of the tiny club and postage stamp sized stage.  During the 6th song, \\"Baby Please Don't Go,\\" the table begins to fill with 4 of the Stones, their girlfriends and assorted hangers-on.  First Mick, then Keith Richards, then Ron Wood and finally Ian Stewart all join in the jam.  Jagger hangs in for several tunes (yes he knows all the words), the highlight of which is Waters classic \\"Mannish Boy.\\"  Fueled by cigarettes and Bourbon, Richards and Wood hang in for the long haul.  Waters takes a seat and the Stones table and others take over including Guy, Junior Wells and a stoned out of his gourd, Lefty Dizz.  I'm not familiar with Lefty but as zonked as he was, the man can play.  And from what I can tell, he plays a right handed guitar...left handed!<br /><br />It might have been nice to have some crowd reaction shots when the Stones appeared, but alas no.  No big deal.  The film is in a squarish TV-style 4:3 aspect ratio on DVD and comes with audio options in Dolby Digital Stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS Digital Surround 5.1.  There are 3 bonus songs including one from the Stones at their appointed gig at the Hampton Coliseum.  If you're a blues lover, you have to have this classic one time show.

0451197968|5.0|The Running Man<br />By Stephen King<br />Writing as Richard Bachman<br /><br />In a time where poverty is the norm, Ben Richards is willing to forfeit his life to save his eighteen month old daughter who is dying of influenza. Richards is soon chosen for The Running Man, a reality TV show where everyone is hunting him for a prize. When nowhere is safe and you must survive to earn your prize what would you do to win?<br /><br />I don't remember watching this movie but I know if I were to ask my mother she would swear I have seen it, growing up with a Stephen King buff I probably have, but when I first started this book the first thing I thought was Jebus it's the original Hunger Games, without children killing each other. Ben Richards is an average guy in hard times which makes him highly relatable, well unless you are a spoiled rich kid I guess, and he is just doing his best to support his family which adds into the story a sympathetic dimension. All in all it's an interesting read; if you are a fan of the dystopian genre then you should definitely pick this one up if you haven't read it already.
B0086700CM|3.0|You just swipe your finger back and forth. Theres no goals other then score by distance or coins. When you die you start all over from the beginning. Looks great, not sure why 8000 people like that much.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|This was a moving and powerful story. I was captivated and really enjoyed reading this book. At times it was emotional but it brought life to the story and made it real.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is amazing, great descriptions throughout by Anita.  I feel all that she has become is from her NDE and this new perspective of hers is so clean and real.  I am very encouraged to try to 'allow' myself to live this way now.  I can open myself to whole new ways of thinking of the 'other realm'!  Limitless!  Thank you Anita.
B008EAV3CC|5.0|I'm surprised to be the first to write a review, I thought they would be pouring in. I absolutely love this book. As a social psychologist I'm fascinated with the content, but I've toiled my way through other books with interesting facts that left me  exhausted. This one reads like a novel, presenting complex stuff as if it were a story in the daily news. This Dan must be a fabulous teacher, but then, he is apparently equally busy being an impressive lecturer. His writing is so good, I even read the detailed description of his colleagues at the end. Just to sample a touch of his [accurate] humor, his program at Duke is called \\"The Center for Advanced Hindsight.\\"<br /><br />But now I'll get down to business. The book really is about dishonesty, relying on a series of fascinating, cleverly designed studies by the author and colleagues all over the world. To read about them, you'd think they were simple, but that's only because you are getting the information after the creative work has been done. This exploration is a great demonstration of the fun of social psychological studies and the inventiveness behind them.<br /><br />The book begins with an examination and rejection of SMORC, the idea that honest or dishonest behavior can be explained by the Simple Model Theory of Rational Crime, a kind of cost/benefit, self-serving analysis which does not include the function of morality. Instead, he creates the story of conflict between two human tendencies: the desire to see oneself as a moral person; and the tendency to engage in what he calls the \\"Fudge Factor.\\" With a little bit of rationalization we can tell ourselves that this little foray into dishonesty is really justified.<br /><br />There follows a series of studies investigating the situations that encourage or discourage cheating. I guess the sad thing -- though it shouldn't surprise us -- is the ease with which we can \\"Fudge.\\" As I look at the three-hole-punch I never did return to SCSU when I retired, I have to accept that I am an example of the truth of the Fudge Factor. I can also identify what tipped me over the edge. Someone else handed it to me, suggesting I take it home. I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself in there somewhere too.<br /><br />Then of course, there's the exploration of \\"catching\\" the cheating bug, with a look at the major ways businesses and politics are vulnerable.<br /><br />I'll leave it to you to enjoy all the stuff in between. I can't end this, however, without mentioning how excited I am by a new insight into my study of forgiveness. I'll quote from page 137. \\"We tend to forgive people for their first offense with the idea that it is just the first time and everyone makes mistakes. And although this may be true, we should also realize that the first act of dishonesty might be particularly important in shaping the way a person looks at himself and his actions from that point on -- and because of that, the first dishonest act is the most important one to prevent.\\" It's too bad I can't just insert another chapter into my \\"When to Forgive,\\" or \\"Forgiving One Page at a Time.\\" OK, I'll be crass and provide a link.[[ASIN:1572241756 When to Forgive: A Personal Guide]]accept that I am an example of the truth of the Fudge Factor.

B005LAIHSQ|1.0|half of the characters are pointless.  the writing and direction is an absolute joke.  the storyline makes zero sense.<br /><br />i'm serious, save your money, save your time.  don't waste 2 hours on this filth.
0446572993|5.0|Baldacci has crafted another solid winner with The Innocent. As is typical with his style, Baldacci created extremely believable and likeable characters that are nevertheless bigger than life. At the same time, he possesses a talent for frugality in his writing without giving up on depth and complexity. The result is a fast paced page turner with nearly nonstop plot twists that are unexpected and undecipherable until the denouement. With The Innocent, the lives of two disparate people, a US assassin and a foster care teenager are thrown together seemingly at random. The resulting dyad harkens back to a classical Batman and Robin pairing that slowly unfolds as the plot thickens and stews. As usual the supporting cast is excellent and the action is virtually nonstop. For lovers of this genre, this is pure word candy. Allocate adequate time to finish, as this tale is too delicious to pause for a breather.
B003Y5H5EW|2.0|I was upset that I spent my money on this rental.  The movie was thrown together.  I wish I would have read the reviews first,  I love Kate Beckinsale and this was a waste of her time.
0441020712|2.0|I have to agree with some previous reviewers.  About the worst book he's put out.  Like trying to pour cold molasses.  Endlessly returning to insults and attitude between siblings...we get it..ok?<br /><br />Just an exercise in frustration waiting for the point to arrive.  I re-read a lot of my books, this won't be one of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a very addicting and challenging game! I love it! It also goes fast way too early, and that helps some people including me get used to the game lol. Its a great game if you're bored.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The video popups got so bad I contacted support. Their suggestion was to play in airplane mode so the videos couldn't connect. They also note that my bandwidth wouldn't be used as long as wi-fi was on. While I agree that these workarounds will serve the purpose, barely, I'd rather just uninstall this intrusive app. Others may not look as good, but at least I won't feel like my device is being hijacked. MobilityWare, take note.
B008ASLNN2|5.0|Renting movies on the Playstation off amazon was an awesome deal! It was a great movie and the features and ease of using amazon was great as well! Will be using it again soon.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I purchased the Garmin 405CX to monitor the distance of my daily runs. I could have gone for the cheaper 105, but the extra bells and whistles caught my attention. I'll tell ya, for a technophile like myself this watch is a godsend. It tracks my heart rate, calories, cadence (with the foot pod), altitude and pace.<br /><br />Display (5/5)<br />The display is crisp and intuitive. The training menu will scroll through 5 different screens. Screens one through three will show up to three different metrics that are determined by you (heart rate, percent max heart rate, pace etc); screen 4 is the default heart rate screen, but can also be adjusted to show more; and screen five is your virtual competitor that runs at a pace determined by you.<br /><br />Control (3/5)<br />As you will read in other reviews, the control scheme uses a touch sensitive outer ring. That being said \\"touch sensitive\\" is a pretty liberal term with this watch, \\"variably\\" or \\"intermittently touch sensitive\\", would be far more appropriate. This is only an issue when you are first setting up your watch, after that you don't really use the side buttons very much.<br /><br />Features (5/5)<br />I am really over the moon with the features offered by this little watch. It has all the main things you would expect out of a sporting watch, but with several thoughtful extras. The two biggest for my purposes were the \\"sunset\\" and \\"go to start\\" functions. I can be a bit of an absent minded runner/hiker, so a feature that tells me when the sun is going to go down (based on the date and my latitude) along with a feature that tells me how to get back the way I came, are right up my alley. I'm sure they've saved me from having to be rescued at least once by now.<br /><br />Accuracy (4/5)<br />I'm not sure what level of accuracy can be expected from a GPS watch, the calories are off by ~5%, the distance by maybe 100m on every km, and the speed doesn't seem to be that great either. Is that a big deal for me? Not really, it falls under the category of \\"close enough\\", but for others it may be a deal breaker. That being said, I do a lot of running/hiking in mountainous/heavily forested areas, and I know there are points that the watch just can't find a signal. If you are doing road running I'm sure the watch will be far more accurate. The watch will also tell you how accurate it is at the time as well (eg accurate to 4m or accurate to 20m etc)<br /><br />Overall (4/5, not an average)<br />Overall this watch does exactly what I bought it for, then delivers a few extras. It is well worth the money I paid for it, and then some I'd say.
0425263908|5.0|Excellent read. Truly enjoyed the characters. Enjoyed this more than the Fifty Shades trilogy. Can't wait for the sequels to come out in October.
0374203032|3.0|Although I greatly admire Sandel's easy and cogent, insightful explanations of moral and philosophical principles, this book is very disappointing. It is a learned and extensive compilation of the expansion of economic thinking, financial markets, and monitization into many aspects of individual, family, commercial, and communal life associated with the general complaint that this detracts from or degrades the intrinsic moral, value or meaning of the activity, object or behavior so commercialized. The essay would have been much better if there was a more extensive discussion of parameters of specifically just what aspects of intrinsic value were being degraded. I would have expected Sandel to be exemplary in detailing what is being lost.

B007Z9QS5K|1.0|I can't believe a movie will so many high profile actors could be so bad.  The writing was bad.  The acting was bad.  The plot was non-existent! Save your time and money!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. Better than the local people on Tv for forecasting the weather.  Get it if you don't have it.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson has created a quirky comedy that is sure to appeal to people of high intelligence, but which might elude those who feast on slapstick comedy alone.  The child actors in this movie are uniformly terrific, as are all the adults.  The movie looks like a Norman Rockwell painting come to life, but with a twist of Salvador Dali thrown in.  There are laughs aplenty, from the parents who refuse to take their foster child back, to the Khaki Scout troop members who are featured prominently.  Edward Norton deserves lots of praise for his performance as the scout master, but the real star is director and writer, Mr. Anderson.<br /><br />I enjoyed this more than any other Anderson film I've seen.

B000JO9Y6I|5.0|When I read the decription of what Dexter was all about, I knew I HAD to watch it. I have always had a fascination with serial killers and wondered what it must be like to be inside their head. Dexter provides a glimpse into the mind of one.<br /><br />I was conflicted while watching Dexter in the beginning because I found myself empathizing and agreeing with his logic as he selected and executed his \\"victims\\" in true vigilante style. While his actions clearly go against societal norms, his reasoning to justify his actions are very logical and almost heroic.<br /><br />What a genius storyline! I intend to purchase every season of Dexter to add to my home entertainment collection.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is fun and has a lot of choices. The points are pretty easy to collect and the games are addicting.
B005DZMODI|5.0|The \\"Layla\\" track is worth the price of the CD! The other tracks are just a bonus. The two tracks feat. Taj Mahal are just icing on the cake.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I haven't seen the Broadway play and must admit I was skeptical about seeing the movie.  Having said that, I LOVED it!!  The 80's, what a fun time with great music and fun \\"characters\\".  The movie and this cd does not disappoint. Tom Cruise singing was fantastic.  Alec Baldwin was a hoot!  It was a very fun movie and listening to the cd brought back \\"movie moments\\".  I must admit, even though I really like her, was disappointed in Julianne Hough's voice.  She sounds like a little girl. See the movie, buy the cd  you'll love both.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|This movie was good for laughs! Several laugh out loud moments. 2 immature new police officers thrown back into high school to locate the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a teenager. This was actually much funnier than I had expected it to be. If you are looking for a light, funny comedy this would be a good choice!
B001DRF84W|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie.  I thought it was overlong and unnecessarily deep compared to what it needed to be.  Not only that, but Eric Bana was pathetic.  I did not think Incredible Hulk with Edward Norton was fantastic by any means, but I did think it was much better than this.
014312093X|4.0|I think a lot of the reviews written here are out of focus.  When they say the story was slow, it's because spycraft is (when things go right) slow.  When they say there wasn't any action, it's because spycraft is an exercise in (the appearance of) inaction.  It's been said before, and I will say it again.  This is not James Bond.  This is not Mission Impossible.  You get the impression that this is the sort of spy thriller that just might be a documentary.  This is a story about anxiety, not adrenaline.  It's about paranoia, not violence.  It has all these things, but not in the proportion that most audiences are used to.  Indiana Jones tells us that most archaeology is done in the library and goes on to demonstrate that the story is fiction by way of never stepping foot in a library (okay, except for when he smashes the floor of one).  Le Carre tells us that most spycraft is financial reports, voting records, dossiers, phone records, mail, and a relentless scrutiny of details.  He makes it feel authentic by showing us how the tools are used, and he makes it personal by showing us the physical and psychological casualties of a secret war, or perhaps a war of secrets.<br /><br />The book is not perfect.  There is a whole stable full of characters.  The plot is thicker than pea soup.  There are times where it's very difficult to understand.  And it's so British I'm sure a torn page would bleed tea.  But I enjoyed it none the less.  Perhaps I could relate to Smiley enough, having suffered my own Ann, and my own Bill, and having felt a time or two like Jim.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I LOVE this app. I have it on my kindle fire and my aneroid phone. I like that my notes appear on both devices and sync together anytime I make a change! On my aneroid I also downloaded the Skitch app which makes the snapshot function on my Evernote so much more fun! :) GREAT APP!
B007MJSSCY|1.0|Great cast, but ultimately a cheesy and predictable film.  I was taken in by Maggie Smith - sadly, even she could not redeem this film.
B0002234LS|3.0|Writers are different from you and me, very different if you can suspend your disbelieve long enough in this film under review, The Secret Garden. Apparently the rather simple act of divorce, simple at least for most people  if we are to believe the statistics, was enough to throw one famous mystery writer, Mort (played by Johnny Depp), over the edge, way over the edge.<br /><br />Perhaps it was finding his wife, Amy, in bed with another man; although event that traumatic experience can be accounted for since she has charged him with \\"statutory neglect\\" due to his writing fog mania withdrawal. Perhaps it was spending those ill-advised lonely months up in a secluded cabin where he was left to brood (and sleep) away his life. Perhaps it was just the cigarette withdrawal struggle that more than one of us has had troubles overcoming. In any case dear Mort (played by Depp with his usual odd-ball character pizzazz) has gone over the edge. And plans to do something about it. Nothing good.<br /><br />As if to prove that life is stranger than fiction  Mort makes up a scenario worthy, well, worthy of a Mort Rainey short story. He creates a savage alternative universe in order to get even with his wife, her lover, and anybody else who gets in the way of his godly intervention. And he gets away with it, for now. For how he does so watch the film, or read Stephen King's' novella. Creepy, Johnny Depp creepy.

B008K9UZY4|3.0|this is generally a good game; sonic the hedgehog always is. but, of course, this one was a little wacky compared to the other games. also, the controls were not so good. playable, but slightly difficult to.
B001JIDE3M|4.0|Let's face it, there are not many movies the whole family can watch and enjoy.  This movie has just the right amount of humor and action to entertain adults while not freaking out the younger kids.  I've got to admit, I watched this movie once in the theatre and twice at home and enjoyed it each time.  Visually it is also a very well made movie.  Can't say Brendan Fraser is my favorite actor but this was the perfect role for him.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not sure how I originally heard about the Wool series but am very glad I decided to get the Omnibus edition for the Kindle. One of the great things about eBooks is the ability for authors to self-publish and make stories available at a reasonable price. I've stumbled across a few good books/authors based on an inexpensive first offering.<br /><br />Was expecting five Wool short stories bundled together. What a surprise to find each installment was longer and more involved. Just finished reading the epilogue to Wool 5 and look forward to more. (Downloaded Wool 6 after discovering it while writing this review!)<br /><br />There was something about the Wool series that felt new. I will definitely read more  stories from Hugh Howey.

0756405890|4.0|I had some pretty high expectations when I finally sat down to read this book. Just now, as I read some of the four and five-star reviews that others have written, I realize my appreciation for THE NAME OF THE WIND is not nearly as enthusiastic.<br /><br />YES, I liked it, and YES, I plan to read the next story in the series. What I liked was Kvoth's story and the sense of wonder I felt when Rothfuss led us into the more wonderful areas of Kvoth's life: his life on the road as a child; his hard life as an orphan in the city; his struggles at the university.  The tavern where he earns his pipes, his feud with a fellow student, and his very self-centeredness make him an interesting charcter in an interesting millieu, which is what I like best about good fantasy.<br /><br />What didn't work for me was the odd departure from the storyline from about page 500 to page 600 (chapters 71-84), where the Kvothe goes off on a wild goose chase.  The writing suffers in this 100-page passage, and in particular, Kvothe's motivations and actions.  It's almost like this was a novella that was written in another time and place and slapped into this novel.  The tone and voice of the whole section dropped me out of the story.<br /><br />Fortunately, the original voice returns when Kvothe comes back to the university, and the story picks up (almost) as if the whole incident never happened. I hope the next volume in the series does not suffer from the same problem. This is a unique and interesting tale, and I am looking forward to reading the next installment.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As a male , I chose this book to see what all the excitement was all about , and what woman consider naughty . For the author's first novel it wasn't bad, though it could have gone deeper into \\" BONDAGE AND DISCIPLINE \\" without becoming a porn novel. As a \\" MASTER \\",Christian comes off as a whimp , allowing his \\" SLAVE \\"to  set the rules of the game .This would never happen in rel life as the master would always rule over his submissive slave demanding that she run to  him at all hours of the day or night . I will read her next book in the trilogy, just to see where she is going with this .
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I really enjoy this genre and this book is hot with an interesting storyline. I am ready fo the next in the series. I hope there is an eventual HEA.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book two let me down as it again showed , Chriatian letting his submissive to dictate how she would be handled by him .I liked the added touch of a villain to  the plot , as well as bringing in both Christian's and Anastasia's families , with the hint of a marriage . The cliff hanger , at the end , was a nice touch , and caused me to  give this second book an extra star . Will now go on to book three .
1241681244|3.0|I am a foreigner, and after reading this book halfway, I asked myself, \\"Gee, is this the way New Yorkers talk? Using the 'F' word most of the time? This is not what I've seen on TV and in the movies.\\" Several scenes are also unconvincing. Top of the list is when Sherman McCoy tries to drag his dashshund into the rain but the mutt resists. Having owned a daschund before, I know it's not the kind of titanic struggle that Wolfe describes. The party scene where NY's socialites boorishly laugh \\"Hack hack hack Haw haw haw\\" is also incredulous. The author also injects too much details into both setting and characters. Even an ashtry is described vividly : \\".. and with his right, he put the cigarette out in a Lalique ashtray with a lion's head sculpted on the rim.\\"  The plot (which revolves around a hit-and-run accident) is too weak to carry the weight of more than 100,000 words in its 680 pages. When I reached chapter 23, I skipped the remaining 8 chapters and jumped to the epilogue just to find out the fate of the protagonist. Wolfe's style of writing is not my taste.

0547569653|5.0|Eat and Run is not only an inspiring book about plant-based eating and ultra running, but also touches on the spiritual side of running.  I've tried a few of the recipes and they are really good, especially the lentil-mushroom burgers.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I loved both the CD and the DVD in this combo, but what I want to know is: Why wasn't \\"Smooth Operator\\" included on the CD? Come on - That's one of her biggest hits!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|After a bad experience with an Izzo Swami 3000 GPS (very inaccurate), I decided to try a laser rangefinder.  I tried both the Bushnell V2 and the Leupold GX-1.  I liked the extra features of the Leupold, however, as others have commented, I found that the yardage reading below the pipper as in the Bushnell was preferred.  Additionally, if you wear glasses when you play as I do, the slight extra distance of your eye from the range finder lens moves the Leupold yardage readout out of your line of sight resulting in one having to tilt the Leupold after taking a laser shot in order to read the yardage.<br /><br />I have used the V2 a few times now and it is simple to use, easy to read (even for an old guy) and is very accurate.  I am very happy with the performance.<br /><br />Update on 10/29/12:  The battery lasted roughly 20 rounds or so.  One drawback is that there is no low battery indicator.  It just acted wacky all of a sudden until I changed the battery.  Probably a good idea to carry a spare battery.  I am still amazed at how it has helped me hit to the right distance.  Still worth 5 stars.
B0084LQQ82|5.0|It was a really good episode because the supense was high and the story was interesting enough to hold my attetion.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|As the title of this review states, Battle Royale is only for the videophile who wants to add to their range of viewed movies. The plot, while barely plausible, provides the energy for this film while the characters are limited to comic book portrayals. Another reason for viewing this film is its similarity to The Hunger Games. Towards the end of the film my main desire was to have the movie end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Helps me fall asleep. Very reliable . The colors and graphics are pleasing to the eyes. My Niel year old is also drawn to this game. We enjoy playing it together.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I downloaded this book based on the synopsis and the many positive reviews here on Amazon.  I must say that this book did not disappoint.  It hooked me in right from the first chapter and upon finishing this book, I immediately downloaded the sequel and read that in about 5 hours.  I think the author has done a great job of creating characters we, as readers, will relate to, will care for, and will remember.  I also thoroughly enjoyed all the poetry in this novel.  A beautiful book and one that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for a new book & author.

1560100842|5.0|This book is the quintessential book to read when starting your animating career! Even when you're a successful animator you can still go back to this book to learn or reinterpret keypoints that you may not have understood before. Iam 15 and have just began animating and this book makes the animating process a cake walk. If I every make it big in the animating business I will make sure to give credit to one man, Preston Blair.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I give it 5 stars because its fun and addictive on my kindle fire!! I recommend that u get this app!! :)
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed the book and ordered the second of the series and have nearly finished that. Ready to order the third.

B008K8U13K|1.0|The required file size on the product page is deceptive. It says 1.2mb required, but once you start the app, it prompts you to download an additional 108mb, in order to launch. I attempted to uninstall from my Kindle Fire, but the app would not uninstall or launch, and I was forced to do a 'reset to factory defaults', and re-download everything to my Kindle Fire just to get rid of this app. I've been a Sonic fan for over 20 years, but this is unacceptable. Sega, you really should be ashamed.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is so fun!!! It is about just running and sliding under objects while a pack of monkeys are chasing you. It works on the kindle fire, so you should really download it! TEMPLE RUN IS SOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!!! :)
B0010T7R5G|1.0|With all the positive reviews, and an inclusion on Robert Ebert's great movies list, I thought this film would have at least have a single redeeming quality. Nope. I guess if you liked the 3rd Matrix this might be up your alley. Melodramatic and predictable in the extreme.<br /><br />The plot feels like it was written by a middle school dungeons and dragons club: the characters are flat, the pacing is totally off, and the fight scenes are essentially taken straight from dragon ball Z.<br /><br />All I can hope for is that mystery science theatre 3000 does a reunion episode so I can get something out of this film.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wasn't sure about this book, as I'd never read anything by this author.  I based my purchase on customer reviews and they weren't wrong.  It seemed everytime I had it figured out, a new twist appeared.  The only negative was I thought the ending was a little abrupt.  Overall, a very good book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one of the most entertaining and self-absorbing I have ever found. And it's free. That was an added bonus. Thanks app store.
B007ZBWJXI|2.0|Well, once again it's an embarassing moment when someone- fond of AOR music- ask me for reviewing a new album by Asia...but for a while their respectable career let me forget the glorious past of each member as former prog stars, above all when the business exigencies lead the strategies of the music market...this way I recognize the interesting features of such a melodic pop rock, still representing a true \\"trademark\\" and not only inside the solo albums by John! After all a good track like \\"Bury Me in Willow\\", despite the lyrics, is well arranged and the simple chorus well done too: the music is in the vein of their controversial debut album and quite acceptable today... of course if I compare it to \\"In The Spirit of Things\\" by Kansas or Journey's music of '81, the present AOR by Asia is a little bit \\"strident\\" and out of time as well!! Instead \\"Tomorrow The World\\", is the only tune whose keyboards are almost equal to those ones which characterized the second side of their first issue, enriched by means of the intelligent arrangement regarding the guitar lines by Steve and a decent rhytmical section as well! Talking about the hit single \\"Face On The Bridge\\" , I don't like it as a simplistic song and it doesn't add anything to the present 30th Anniversary...perhaps \\"Faithful\\" with their strong chorus and a good team work in general could be an exception, but it doesn't change my evaluation: 2 stars inside a prog music collection and 3 stars 1/2 in a AOR discography
B0019QEG90|5.0|Still Waters is Bee Gees' penultimate studio album. The (professional) critics are a little luke-warm about this album but in my opinion the material included, while certainly not far-off the beaten-path, is very good. There are some throwbacks, some modern influences, little experimentation but overall this is all, unmistakably, Bee-Gees. Personally, I find the arrangement (of the songs) very well thought-out, as the music flows very well from one song to the next, lending good coherence to the album as a whole.<br />Technically the CD is well produced, the material shows a balanced use of the available dynamic range, minimal clipping (here and there) and is essentially noise and artifact free. Headphone audition does reveal some sound constriction (at times) but I can't decide if that was intended or is a result of post-processing. However, I should mention here that although not advertised on the cover, the inner booklet does bear the HDCD symbol, suggesting that the mastering may have been done that way. The inclusion of HDCD signals (and any other processing associated with them) would certainly explain the above mentioned constriction of the dynamic range. Those with audio gear capable of HDCD decoding should be able to put this issue to rest.<br />To conclude I should note that this CD is the 1997 UK release by Polydor and it does not contain the two bonus tracks: Ring Around the Moon and Love Never Dies (tracks which are, apparently, very good). Even so, Still Waters is a good effort, worth considering even by those who are not die-hard Bee-Gees fans.<br /><br />Update, July 20, 2012: Playback on a PC running Windows 7 with Windows Media Player v12.. has confirmed that the CD was indeed recorded as HDCD.
0143036424|1.0|my first time with this author (recommended because I like C.D.Box -much too wordy and descriptive-couldn't follow a plot-couldn't finish it after giving it the benefit of the doubt by plowing through 175 pages

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was told that I just had to read these books, so I did as everyone else was reading them or had read them.<br />I was immediately blown away. The story is like a fairy tale, that eventually comes true. There were some parts that I kept reading over and over, and just learned so much. I am not ignorant, but I did learn !! I gave it to my husband to read and we re-read it together. WOW ! He loved it too. From a man's point of view, he learned things to. We are now finished with the Trilogy and we both agree that it was amazing! Thanks to: E.L.

POINT OF NO RETREAT the story after SLAMMED is just as good. I have recommended these books to everyone and if you are reading this I suggest you STOP READING THIS & START READING SLAMMED ;) I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
0307592731|2.0|It was Catharine Montgomery, in 1926, who first thought of the Pacific Crest Trail.  She suggested there should be a border-to-border trail  winding down the heights of the western mountains.  In 1957 the trail was still a dream ---- too many logistics, but the trail was finally completed in the 1990's.<br /><br />Hiking the trail had nothing to do with getting from point A to point B, but how it felt to be in the \\"wild\\".  It was to witness the accumulation of trees and mountains, the deserts and rivers, and perhaps to even experience the sunrises and sunsets.  The experience was both powerful and fundamental .... to be a part of the nature.<br /><br />After living through some bad personal problems, Cheryl Strayed starts off her solo journey with very little hiking experience and it becomes a life changing experience for her.  She hiked the PCT from the Mojave Desert, to Bridge of Gods in Washington state ... over eleven hundred miles.<br /><br />It was a rather good read, but so much repetition ---- I found myself skimming over some of the parts.  The hiking is only a part of the story.  The author shares too much of her troubled past with her readers ---- way too much was revealed and some very distasteful parts with vulgar language and sex.  In my opinion, it would have been more enjoyable without it, therefore I could only give it two stars.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A nice game to past down time but the higher the level the more challenging it is! A great game

0061733199|5.0|IF you're ever lost in the wilderness, you'll wan't this book. It covers so many aspects of survival It doesn't go in depth with a lot of it, and some trial and error may be involved, but if your smart, you can figure it out. Very useful book. A good read.
B005LAIGPU|1.0|This thing basically sucked[[ASIN:B005LAIGPU Chronicle (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo +Digital Copy)]]I bought thre dvd based upon other recomendations and it proved to be the biggestr mistake I have made with any movie.

0307592731|4.0|This book was truly memorable.  The author connects with the reader on so many levels. You almost feel as if you are with her on the walk.  Very well written and never boring.  This book is also inspirational on a spiritual level.  Definitely one of my favorites.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I watched the movie and had to have the soundtrack. I don't normally do that.<br />Great CD to listen to.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I bought this book just like a lot of people on Amazon, based on the reviews. I know that an writer can have his/her family and friends write reviews, but over 100 5-star reviews... I don't have that many friends. Anyways, I found this book really interesting. The writer has a real talent to write. The main character is not just a single dimensional warrior. He takes great pains to show that this character has depth of thought, feeling, and desire. At no point do you feel that the main character being forced. The discovery is great. The supporting characters are given attention, but not enough to distract. We find out about their history, and have emotional investment with them also.<br /><br />I have read that some other reviewers are critical of some of the editing, I am not so much. I have read much worse edited books.  On those books I provided reviews stating that.<br /><br />Blood Song is the first in a series that I will keep reading and reviewing. If it ever turns bad I will let everyone know.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it but the game lags on the kindle which makes it hard to play. It is a draws you in and makes you want to play

076115678X|5.0|I have finally been liberated! After reading this book I have the confidence to rock my natural curls.  I've always been told that I should wear my hair curly but I did not have the courage.  This book is amazing and I am NEVER going back to blow frying my hair.  I've even lost some weight because now I do not worry abut sweating during my workouts. I would like to see a 3rd edition of this book with an  even more detailed section on multi-cultural hair.

0345803485|1.0|Oh ye of little faith.....Ye have said it all before me!  This was one of the most hilariously, poorly written tomes that I have ever read!  And I'm only up to the infamous contract!  I will admit, I wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I received this book as a trade from Paperbackswap.com.  No cash outlay. As a high school teacher, I do feel that this could be a naive teenager's fantasy of a relationship- the inexperienced virgin, who blushes constantly, murmuring \\"Oh, crap\\" so convincingly.  The male protagonist- devastatingly handsome, billionaire, concert level pianist, accomplished pilot, but with one fatal flaw....he's totally into the BDSM scene.  As my students would say....\\"booooo-ring.\\" Whatever. LOL.
B007FZ7R7W|2.0|When I heard Chris Brown was coming out with a new album, I was very excited to listen to it. Once I turned it on and listened through it, I was sorely disappointed. Amidst all the bad PR, i've always felt he was a good artist, but he really didn't deliver this time. If you like his really light, soft music, then you would enjoy it. But, Chris is a fantastic rapper and lacks any real type of rap songs on this album.
1439170916|5.0|IF you are a physician in any field (not just oncology) or interested in history of science/medicine or a cancer patient or care about a cancer patient, this book is an absolute must read.  You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it.  I plan to read it again in a month or two (read it so fast the first time because it is such an enjoyable read (which sounds truly weird since it is a book about the history of cancer).  I am ordering three more copies to give physician friends of mine as presents. I cannot imagine that you would be disappointed with this book.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.  It is that well written and I learned so much! Other reviewers have gone into much more detail about the contents of this book but I just wanted to add my kudos to their much better reviews.  Truly, I hope this very talented physician will continue to write.  BUT with the compassion and understanding for patients that comes through in his writing, I also hope that he does not leave the practice of medicine!
B004GF244K|5.0|Long time Beatles fan and I enjoyed this tribute a lot.  Reminded me a little bit of the Bangla Desh concert, without George of course.  Just about everyone he has ever worked with was there.  Not every rendition was as good as the original, but overall I enjoyed it and will watch repeatedly.
0307719219|3.0|I really enjoyed reading about the first 1/4th of this book. The writer's revisit popular theories on why nation's fail or succeed, then propose their own, which, ostensibly makes way more sense. They firmly establish this theory and lead you step by step through their line of thinking, using ancient and modern examples. The theory is sound, and though the premise may sound boring for non-economists or non-sociologists, I am neither, yet found the study fascinating. It's a good read, it's well written, and it doesn't fall into insignificant side-tracking.<br /><br />What I found a bit tedious was the need to re-iterate this theory over and over again. It seems that while the theory itself bears merit and is certainly worth a detailed analysis by economists, or students of civics and history, there's no need to recount every single instance of a failed nation in labored detail. I kept expecting the book to demonstrate the effects of these failures on modern society and globalism, but they never quite got there. The conclusions drawn at the end could have been drawn after about 100 pages, leaving me to wonder why the authors felt the need to drag it out for so long. Brevity would have served the subject matter better. Again, it was never boring, just unnecessarily repetitive.
0312330537|4.0|I learned a lot from Shantaram.  My only experience with India was a day in Bombay and two days in Delhi in 1969 and the movie Slumdog Millionaire.  The author gives a very detailed view of life n the \\"slums\\" of Bombay and in the prison system at the time.  Also the mob the war in Afganistan against the soviets, etc. etc. etc.  You see why it takes over 900 pages to tell this epic tale.  I found the author's style appealing and read large amounts of the book at single sittings.  I do recommend it for it's scope and about a part of the world most of us know little about.
0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain's latest work, entitled \\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\" is a good summary of the differences between introverts and extroverts.  It helps to remove some of the misconceptions and myths the general public has about introverts (shy, nerdy, unpopular, etc).  She uses real world examples and scientific studies to elucidate her point.  It is an interesting book that's doesn't go overboard with too technical a discussion on the physiological origins of introversion or a melodramatic rant about extroverts taking over the world.  She presents a balanced viewpoint and also gives some practical advice near the end of the book on how to raise introverted children.  Her comprehensive notes in the back on each important phrase from each chapter can be daunting at first glance, but it's probably just the result of her introverted tendencies to be thorough and complete.  They're interesting to read if you want to know the background and proof to some of her claims.  Overall, it's an enjoyable and worthwhile read, but there's nothing so spectacular or ground breaking in it to \\"permanently change how we see introverts\\" (as the book jacket proclaims).  Maybe \\"create more awareness\\" would be a better way to describe it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|The book is an excellent read. It picks up from the first book and takes you along a wonderful ride full of vivid imagery and emotions. Highly recommended.

B0081HLM2E|5.0|Quite simply, this is a quintessential cinematic thriller brilliantly executed.  Everything about this Norske import reeks of drama, tension, passion, and excitement; and some of it smells of sweet absurdity.<br /><br />The creators of the script and executors of the film never lost sight of what is the ultimate goal of any movie:  Entertainment!<br />Almost every second of this movie propels the story forward in such a way that the viewer becomes entirely enamored of this story, and the action propelling it is so frenetic and compelling that it pulls all manner of reaction from its audience from lust, to ridicule, to shock, to revulsion, to laughter, to admiration all of which keep one riveted to the screen.  For nobody wishes to miss a single second of this action-packed mystery thriller.<br /><br />I'm not going to give the plot away, likely other reviewers have done this for you, other to say that this is an action-packed mystery thriller that throws in all of the elements that Hollywood deems necessary for a successful action-packed mystery thriller and does it in such a cleverly nonchalant self-conscious way that one is charmed in the very process of identifying it all (gratuitous breast, impossible action, vulgar sexual content--a peculiarity of contemporary Norwegian film, incidentally--, blood and gore, right down to a trite romantic interlude).<br /><br />Yes, all of the Hollywood cliche strings are tossed in front of the audience and amazingly none of them are left dangling untied at the end of the show.<br /><br />If, at the very end of this movie, you don't have a huge grin of satisfaction on your face, you aren't a sentient being, my friend.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Attending the glorious 1982 Theatrical Version, Ridley Scott's basic heart-felt design, inspired us to ecstatic matrimony in 1983, and to our partnership in a labyrinthine quest of endless detective activity, upon our sudden discovery of William S. Burroughs's little so-called BladeRunner \\"screenplay,\\" our first clue to how this monumental epic cinematic creation acquired its compellingly spellbinding name. Not recalling this connection included in the film credits we consulted a literary journalist friend who instantly wrote a fascinating short article. Most interesting,he suggested the Burroughs diabolic outlook  explaining gross discrepancies with Philip K. Dick's ingenious humanitarian concepts throughout his novel, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?,\\" presumably the only text that inspired the movie. We later learned that the solitary use of the Burroughs piece was its then-obscure title, and no part of its adaptation of the Philip E. Nourse novel by that name. In pursuing our adventurous inquiry, the mystery has grown evermore bewildering with the years. Wouldn't many other enthusiasts of this profound cinematic colossus be encouraged to participate in this somewhat pleasantly obsessive expedition in cultural private investigation along film noir routes of research. As with Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey,(like Blade Runner including Douglas Trumbell)the possibilies seem infinite for ourselves, and Amazon has no apparent shortage of materials.

B0023SDPS6|3.0|This was my first exposure to this author and I deliberately started with his first novel. I rated it three stars. For the first two thirds of the book I kept threatening to quit but stuck it out. Probably a good idea as the ending redeemed the book enough that I'll try another. Maybe the author improved his craft. As others have noted, the protagonist is a small town sheriff investigating a series of homicides seemingly related to a rape case involving a young female American Indian. Since there is a Native American reservation nearby, and since Walt Longmire's best friend is a Native American, a reviewer tried to compare the author to Tony Hillerman, an error of some magnitude. Longmire's cast of characters are mildly interesting but hardly riveting. The case plods along for too long but ends well. Interestingly, though the setting is the Big Horn Mountain area of Montana, the author doesn't do much to evoke our interest in that setting. The author C.J. Box does that far better. And Longmire isn't one of the more interesting protagonists, although he shows promise. I'm hoping the next book will justify my sticking with him.

B006RUJST6|5.0|This book and it's sequel were so good!!! I HIGHLY recommend.  Beautifully written...these characters will stay with me a long time!
030758836X|3.0|The writing is superb, the characters fairly well rounded and most of the plot is very well done. That said, I have to agree with many others here. This book started out even better than her previous ones. I was curious, suspicious, and on the edge of my seat. I was confused about characters and motivations -- just like I was supposed to be.  Then wham -- much becomes clear. Unfortunately...much begins to unravel as well. Without resorting to spoilers, I have to say that I found the year (plus) of planning, the jaunt to the meth/redneck cabins, and much (much) else in the second half to be beyond belief. Only the quality of the writing, and my prior investment in the characters, made me keep on, hoping that what I saw coming near the end just couldnt be true -- it was. Very jarringly unauthentic way to leave it.

B004QL7K6G|3.0|WANDERLUST is NOT \\"Wuthering Heights\\" nor is it \\"CITIZEN CANE!\\"  It is silly, funny, daring, hysterical and a FUN and entertaining film.  If you want serious realism and characters with extreme depth - go find another movie.  Personally - I love it!!  David Wain is a director with vision and a keen sense of slightly over-the-top humor!  LOVE IT!!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow, I really love this book.....a great read for anyone looking for something different.<br />It takes the 'Big Brother is watching' to a whole new level.<br />We are not alone.....
B00881VLCE|3.0|I got this app thinking that there would be more puzzles to challenge me with as well as more categories to chose from.  I also didn't think the double click feature was working and it froze my kindle. On the good side it was fun for a few hours.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The CPU itself is great! I overclocked it to 4.2 Ghz, and my gaming DIY PC was a star! The integrated graphics without the drivers are horrible. But installing the drivers makes all the difference: 1.0 (without drivers)->6.7 (with drivers) on the Windows Experience Index (rating from 1.0 to 7.9) for graphics and gaming! It was even better than my ATi Radeon HD 6450! (It scored 4.4 and 4.6, for Aero and Gaming, respectively)<br /><br />But the CPU cooler was the only con. And it was a biggie. I can take Intel's side in saying most people don't like the risk of overclocking. But then again, this is an unlocked CPU that was meant for overclocking!<br /><br />The temperatures were 35 Celsius idle, 70 Celsius while gaming, at 3.4Ghz (Turbo Boost was off). But going to 4.2 Ghz meant 65 Celsius idle, and 100+ Celsius doing simple browsing! Of course, I turned the PC off immediately and never used it again until I installed a different Cooler Master CPU cooler.<br /><br />Though I recommend the CPU, I think you should order a Hyper 212 Plus or some other CPU fan with it.<br /><br />EDIT: Even though the included fan was bad, the Rocketfish one I ordered was even worse. Due to this I am changing my review to 5 stars.<br /><br />EDIT2: Actually, the fan is pretty good if you don't use the CPU in the background (antivirus and BOINC). The temperatures are 10 Celsius lower than with BOINC running.
014241543X|3.0|In the blink of an eye, Mia's world is changed. She's alive, the only survivor of her family's car accident, and she's in an in-between world where she's watching her injured body fight for survival.<br /><br />Gayle Forman tells an emotional tale of Mia's fight to decide if she'll stay in a world that her parent's and brother have left, or if she'll join them on the other side. The story is told in alternating chapters. One story tells of Mia and Adam's journey. It's a story where a hard core rocker falls in love with a classical cellist, born into a musical family that more matches the taste of her boyfriend.<br /><br />It's a beautiful high school love story, that by itself, is a wonderful read. The other chapters detail Mia's struggle to die or not to die. It was this side of the story that truly captivated me. Mia is floating in a world watching her friends and family mourn over the loss of her parents and brother, while at the same time watch and wait for Mia to survive her injuries, and multiple surgeries. The most heart wrenching events that Mia must watch are the visits from Adam. It is one of these visits where Mia truly decides if she'll stay.<br /><br />I chose to read If I Stay because it's sequel, Where She Went, is nominated for YALSA's 2012 Teen Top Ten. It was a short, quick, and easily a one-sitting read. My struggle with the book is that I loved each story that was separately told in the alternating chapters, but I was so much more involved in Mia's struggle to stay or go, that I found myself skimming through the chapters that detailed her love story with Adam. It in itself is a wonderful story, but for me, it really stayed in the shadows of her story to survive.
0061020680|4.0|I've been loving the Discworld novels, reading them thus far in publication order. I really feel that Pratchett is starting to hit his stride with this one.<br /><br />What happens when Death seeks an apprentice? It may be that only Pratchett would think to ask, and even more likely that only he would come up with an answer that makes me and my 13 year old both laugh aloud (though not necessarily at the same bits. It may be best not to know sometimes). If [[ASIN:0060855924 The Color of Magic: A Discworld Novel (Discworld Novels)]] reminded me a lot of Douglas Adams, with Rincewind about as much in control of his destiny as Arthur Dent, Mort is more intentional and funnier, even while it has a darkish theme (though less dark than you might expect with Death as a main character). Without spoiling anything, there is a scene where Death, tired of his job, is interviewing with a head-hunter for placement in a new line of work.  Discussion of his work experience is absurd, outrageous, and hilarious.<br /><br />Despite his best efforts, however, the book is not really about Death. The title character, Mort, becomes Death's apprentice by chance and default, but is not content just to be blown by the winds of fate. Mort struggles from the beginning to take control of his destiny, and if he screws it up big time (nearly destroying the world, or  possibly the universe, in the process), he does it with a reasonable idea of the outcome he wants.  And when fate seems to be overcoming his desires, he pulls out an impressive amount of will-power to remain his own man.<br /><br />Mort's love-life is perhaps the least convincing aspect of the story, yet even that feels to me surprisingly real--he's a teen, with limited ideas about what love should look like. I won't say more on that subject lest I offer a spoiler.  (Note to self: ask teen sons what they thought of the romance. If they noticed it.) I gave the book four stars because I save five for perfection, and I think Pratchett will get there. But I'd make it 4.5 if I could. Recommended for readers who like humor, from about age 12 up.ll get there. But I'd make it 4.5 if I could. Recommended for readers who like humor, from about age 12 up.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app I have seen or used. It has a really good search feature and the bookmarks tool is good. I use it in church and I bookmark the verses from the sermon. I also like the reading plans. These are helpful with staying connected with God's word. I would encourage everyone to get this app.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|There's not much to say, it was silly, poorly written, and a very unrealistic story, overloaded with unrealistic sex scenes.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever the game rocks I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This video is one of the best things to ever be produced. I am at a loss for words to describe the immense sadness I hold for the chosen ones and their plights for survival during the infamous unnecessary reign of hatefulness from a bunch of ignorant pathetic embasels who chose to attempt to exterminate people based on religion, even though these human beings were white or anglo saxon, just like them, the nazi's. I refuse to capitalize the N of that term because it is about a group that feels they are superior to everyone else, when they are truly not so. I am moved to always never return hate for hate, and if this movie taught me this, then it can teach generations in the same manner, not to indulge in the same mannerisms of hate as well. To be color blind and religiously blind to other human beings is the best way to live and this video is the best tool to teach this lesson and others along with it.
0142420891|5.0|In the blink of an eye, Adam's world is changed. Unknown to Adam that because of words he spoke to Mia, she chose to stay. She chose to stay in a world without her parents and little brother; in a world where everyone would tiptoe around her. Once she chose to stay, she also chose to continue on her lifelong journey to attend Juilliard and continue to play her cello with more passion than ever. She also chose to walk away from Adam, breaking his heart, his soul and his spirit.<br /><br />Because of Adam's heartbreak, once he found his way out of the dark he was left in, he rose to the top with his rock band. But it was his much and lyrics, brought on my a tremendous angst, that put his band on top of the world. Now Adam in living the life. He travels the world with his band, playing in sold out arenas. He's constantly in the tabloids with his hot celebrity girlfriend, and can rarely go out in public without being mobbed. But that's not what Adam wants. A void has been left in his life and he's only trying to fill it.<br /><br />While in New York, awaiting a flight to join up with his band on tour, Adam happens upon a young concert series, with his truly, Mia, on stage. An emotional journey through memories, and Mia's city may just be what Adam needs to either close, or reopen the void that shot him to stardom.<br /><br />WOW ~ WOW ~ WOW<br /><br />That's what I have to say about Where She Went. After reading If I Stay, I wasn't sure if I was in for another good book that was satisfying, but not over the top, or if this sequel would sail above. Sail above it did!! To say that this book was satisfying is a severe understatement. Gayle Foreman hit the nail on the head with this sequel.<br /><br />Told from Adam's point of view, this journey through heartbreak and survival is like watching your favorite team in the championship and routing for them to win. Like If I Stay, Where She Went is also told in alternating chapters. Foreman pens Adams journey through heartbreakand stardom in one set, while the other set is the reunion of a lifetime!  The alternating chapters and stories in Where She Went is a beautiful match!
0307951529|5.0|This is a no more excuses book. Be aware before reading it that once finished all of your stalling, alibis and cop-outs will no longer be valid.  The $100 Startup has removed the final barrier - Money. There is nothing stopping you from achieving what you want. Read it twice, three times if necessary because this is a Freedom Book. It has freed me from the shackles that bound my dreams. Never will I be grateful enough to have found this book.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games all on one! I love all the games but my least favorite is the sushi game. however my favorite game is parachute.  it feels like games that you're just having fun with but you're exercising your brain
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Well, like I said up there, best bible app evar!! I love how easy it is to share on Facebook.
0399536108|5.0|Of all the books I have read in my life none have spoken to the core, the true nature of who we are all as humans - individuals; with our own thoughts, hopes, dreams and reason for being. The Art of Non-Conformity is the bible to living one's own life. Do yourself a favor take a few hours, pick it up and take a good look at your life. Through his story you may just find your own. I know I did. It has changed my life knowing that I am not alone in my frustration with the way things are in the world. I too have the power to change.

You get to the end and are genuinely disappointed to be at the end.<br /><br />Hugh - would absolutely pay a higher price for the sequels! Get writing!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game isn't the one you know from school. It has a lot in common with the 'tap' games that are out, except for the fact that it is still enjoyable and playable even without buying upgrades and additional dollars/points. You do have a limited amount of energy, which can be replenished through purchases, or else you can wait a period of time and it will refill on its own. It's a fun game, and enough strategy to keep it interesting. I enjoy this game a lot, and it is totally worth the download!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|G.R.R. Martin is still the best in the field, nobody stands his equal. If you think the HBO series is great, read the 4 books and get to this amazing adventure that is Dance with Dragons!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun! I love taking care of my village and buying new things. I love this game!
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple Run is a good game. Sometimes it freezes and the game is a little hard. Otherwise... its an OK game.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was a solid read. It balances well the inner journey that the author takes with her epic travel along the trail.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book about two decades ago and I was blown away. It is one of the few books that I have re-read.<br /><br />The plot is very well crafted with several great sub-plots in the background. There is a wealth of fantastic and memorable characters. And it has several surprises in the end.<br /><br />This book is a great read, but it is also great book on leadership.  I believe the Marine Corp. uses or used this book as part of its officer training.  And the leadership qualities is why I gave the book to my daughter when she was about thirteen. She loved it and learned from it.<br /><br />When the author Mr. Card spoke at her university, she bought another copy and asked him to sign it and then she gave it to me. Today, she keeps a small stack of books in the guest bathroom of her house in London, and this one is on top.  She does that to see who will comment on it, who has read it.<br /><br />I have been a reading machine all of my life. I have read a ton of classics, a ton of science fiction, and a ton of noir (as well as other genres).  And this book has elements of all three.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|addicting and fun. hard to get hearts though. otherwise this is a very fun game for kids and adults alike.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This season of Dexter is the BEST season yet! John Lithgow plays the Trinity killer with what seems like a normal life that Dexter longs to have. The twists and turns of this season and the WTF moments are great! The ending was spoiled for me BUT I still couldn't believe what happened! I highly recommend this season box set!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is the worst I've ever read, by far.  Don't even waste your time.  It is very poorly written, and I felt like I was reading a 17 year old's fantasies.<br /><br />It's extremely unrealistic--- what man can possibly be an ultra horny billionaire at age 26 who has kinky sex or stalks a 21 year old awkward college girl all day instead of working, all while being very attractive and a do-gooder, trying to save the world? Better yet, what kind of 21 year-old present-day female college student doesn't know how to use a smartphone or email anyone on a laptop, and refers to both her vulva and vagina as \\"there.\\"  I'm sorry, but if you're 21 and you can't even call your anatomical parts by their names, you're probably not mature enough to be having sex.  Speaking of the sex, the scenes weren't even steamy.  Most of the sex consisted of Christian Grey telling Ana he will \\"have her now,\\" her orgasming the second he touches her, and him following suit immediately after.<br /><br />I found it hard to even make myself finish reading this book.  Then again, it's Twilight fan fiction, and I hated Twilight.  I grew really tired of hearing Ana talk about her \\"inner goddess\\" (57 times), say \\"crap/double crap/Holy crap\\" (92 times), and the best, describe everything as \\"fifty shades of [insert adjective]\\" (22 times).  Apparently E.L. James did not have a thesaurus available to her while she writing this book of 'crap.'
1559409002|5.0|This movie appears as a low budget movie, but it is actually very unique and classic.  I loved the scenes, actors, story and filming.  The Criterion DVD is THE only choice for this movie as the picture is crisp and clean and LOTS of extras!
B005LAIHSG|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie. My mom and I went and saw it in the theatre, unsure of what to think of it. About the first 45 minutes were awesome; very beautifully filmed, with good action and decent acting. Once Snow White and the Huntsman had been traveling together for about ten minutes, however, my mind started to throb with agonizing boredom. The story moved incredibly slow, with bad acting--loved Hemsworth as THOR, & he was good in this role, though the script fairly SUCKED, and Stewart is the most horrible actress I've ever seen, being the top-paid one in Hollywood for one (ugly) expression--though Theron was good, even if most of her monologues turned into meaningless rambling.<br /><br />When are we ever going to get a STRONG HEROINE???? (Buffy, please come back!!!) Snow White spends most of the movie running around w/ the Huntsman through the woods, and getting scared at trees and vines. When we meet the dwarves (some of the most entertaining characters in the movie) we keep getting told that Snow White is special, and the one to end the war, yaddy-yaddy-yadda. The aforementioned war took forever to get around to actually happening. In between, there was a TERRIBLE attempt at romance--bad love triangles follow Stewart around everywhere--and it was never even solved, even if the Huntsman's kiss brought Snow back to life after eating the apple. Once we got to the war, Snow White dressed in armor and carried a sword--since when did she learn how to wield one?--and runs into the castle while all the men fight behind her & tries to kill the Queen. When she finally does, she tells her blandly that she can't have her heart (apparently the Queen needed it to keep herself young & beautiful... Not that Snow is prettier than her, something I think just about EVERYONE noticed)... and then she sits down and starts CRYING. She seems to feel SORRY for the Queen. The woman who would have killed her without a second thought, stole her childhood & stuffed herup in a tower for most of her life... Snow CRIES over her. And, being the bad actress that she is, Kristen Stewart didn't even cry believably.<br /><br />However, I can't be ALL mean. Most of the time, the filming was beautiful, and the action scenes were reasonably good, if pointless. The glass soldiers were cool.<br /><br />I don't want to be mean to the actors either. Kristen Stewart could probably do well in SOMETHING, if only she'd be in a movie with a good script, and start to be more expressive.<br /><br />I usually don't like to be this critical. But this movie was sooooooooooooooo slow-moving and mind-numbingly boring... And it could've been so much better.
B008K8U13K|1.0|I use to like sonic but when I found out you only go through obstical courses it was no fun and turned lame
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  it works really well and is fun and adicting.  buy it if you haven't!  that is all there is to say.
0345803485|1.0|Where to start? This is the worst excuse for a \\"novel\\" I've ever read. I read a lot, I enjoy a little bit of everything and I was intrigued at the idea for this \\"mainstream BDSM\\" book. I was horribly disappointed.<br /><br />First off, the writing is abysmal. I'm not an author but I swear a teenager wrote this. It feels as though the author could only come up with a limited list of phrases for her bland main character to use and simply stuck with them without even trying to develop some personality. I mean really, how many times can a reader hear \\"holy/double/triple crap\\" before they want to throw the book away for being crap? The main character has no depth so she blushes, whines, gasps and bites her lip through her sad, boring little life all the while wondering why she is so desireable to \\"Mr Grey\\". It's OK Ana, we don't understand it either.<br /><br />Also, if you're going to write a book about a BDSM relationship, do some research. Deep research. Ask people who are involved in the lifestyle to help you if you can't manage to develop an understanding (which begs the question \\"why the hell are you writing a book about something you have no experience with, nor do you seem to want to gain any experience/knowledge). Do anything besides dance around the intricacies of a Dom/sub relationship to the point that anyone involved in this lifestyle wants to strangle you.<br /><br />It helps if you have some experience actually having sex, in order to write erotica. I just cringed at myself for even trying to call this abomination \\"erotica\\". The scenes between the characters are unrealistic and poorly written. Mr Grey crooks his finger at Ana and she explodes into a reality warping, mind blowing orgasm. Several times in the few minutes they actually play. Any woman reading this knows that almost all of us DO NOT orgasm at the drop of a hat, no matter how \\"intense\\" the sex. I wish I could, don't get me wrong, but let's be real here. Such BS.<br /><br />Overall, I am just disgusted that this book is so popular and that it made the NYT best-seller list. If you're thinking about getting it, DON'T. If you find it as titillating as so many people seem to, you need to get laid more or get laid better. Ugh, several hours of my life I can't get back.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this is a amazing game for a tablet. How many free roam games do you find on the app store or the android store.<br />? This one and the combat isn't horrible and the web swinging is well... amazing. worth more than 7 dollars. if you ask me. the graphics are ps2 worthy also so not amazing but not terrible.

030758836X|4.0|Nick and Amy look perfect on the outside...married 5 years, he's handsome, and she's pretty and wealthy. But scratch beneath the surface, and things aren't as rosy as they appear. When Amy disappears on their wedding anniversary, their \\"perfect marriage\\" beings to reveal itself as anything but, and Nick's unusual behavior makes him a suspect. The cops quickly zero in on Nick, but he has the support of Amy's loving parents (for now).<br /><br />\\"Gone Girl\\" is narrated by Nick, beginning right after Amy's disappearance. It alternates with entries from Amy's diary, written prior to her disappearance, detailing a marriage in deterioration. Amy writes, \\"I don't feel like Nick's wife. I don't feel like a person at all...I feel like I could disappear.\\"<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. By the end of the first, I was getting a bit antsy over the continuing police investigation. However, the opening sentences of the second section threw me for a loop and grabbed back my waning attention and held it until the end of the story.<br /><br />A quick note - I got a kick out of the Ellen Abbott character, clearly modeled on Nancy Grace. I could hear Nancy's righteous twang in my head as I read Ellen's dialogue.
0307730697|5.0|I loved this book!!  This is the inspiring story of a true American Hero who overcame drug addiction and numerous injuries by relying on God and never giving up!  Adam had his faults and weaknesses, just like all of us, but he didn't let them get the best of him.  Adam was supported by his wife, parents, and numerous friends and serves as a reminder that none of us are alone in our struggles.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  Adam's story is very moving and I found it personally motivating.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is as fun as playing on the computer but way more convenient. The app loads really fast. I haven't found any glitches.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok but hard to get enough points to buy new games but some of the games are fun to play while others are more difficult.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game sucked me in completely. Before I played, I didn't understand the hype. But after finishing the tutorials, at last an hour of my life passed by before I could blink.<br /><br />Like Lay's potato chips, you can't play just one level. One turns into two, turns into ten.<br /><br />Great game!
