B002M9WW30|4.0|Rocky is what it is.  We all have our battles and trials to overcome.  These movies speak to that, and to the power of a great wife for a man.  The quality of transfers is good. If you like Rocky and its theme, you'll like the series. It's not the very best movie ever made, and it's not as enduring as It's A Wonderful Life or other such timeless classics; but for fans of these types of sports themed, &#34;overcoming&#34; stories, it's good!

1416972242|4.0|Again, I couldn't put this book down (I finished it less than 24 hours after finishing the first one). The pacing and weirdly unpredictable bits are what knock it down to 4 stars--the book moves along nicely most of the time, but every once in a while (perhaps 5 times throughout the book) it hyperaccelerates and everything happens all at once. It was disorienting and annoying, though it didn't detract enough to make the book unreadable (at all). I continue to love the characters (whose development was good and interactions were mostly consistent and believable) and the premise. I've heard the series takes a bit of a downturn after this, but I'm hoping they were wrong and/or I still enjoy the remainder.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Tess of the D'urbervilles<br />This was a history lesson from the period and was very good at keeping my attention because I am a history enthusiast. However, the ending was too sad to make it a five star rating.

1416972250|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am still frustrated that the author makes her characters so blind to some matters of the heart--to create people so blind to their own emotions is a popular thing to write, but I think is untrue in the degree to which it is used here. In a similar vein, the author was a bit heavy-handed in dropping hints as to the big twist. All of the shadow and veiled innuendo pointed to a fairly clear conclusion, which coalesced as this enormous revelation to the characters while being abundantly obvious to me. I have no problem with hints and foreshadowing, and in dropping little bits here and there for a clever reader to look back on and proverbially smack themselves in the forehead over. But the sheer weight of the foreshadowing made me feel like the author was underestimating me as a reader. And even if I pick up on things faster than most, that's a dangerous line to cross. It also makes the characters look incredibly stupid; if I can figure things out a hundred or so pages in, why does it take them five hundred pages to do the same? No one can be THAT blind, can they?<br /><br />However, despite the book's flaws, the plot and the writing are gripping and compelling, I had a difficult time ever setting the book aside, and despite warnings about the following book I hope that the series continues to impress.
B005IQZB14|1.0|I disliked this character from beginning to end. The book had no point and the trek either. I keep waiting for an epiphany but all I got is &#34;I did it&#34;. Seems one of the many pointless themes in the book.

0061438294|2.0|Really, this is a ... well I can't figure a less provocative way of saying it ... so I'm going with the kindness of ambiguity, this has got a nice handle, but it is over-rated IMHO. I'd've politely tried to get a partial refund 5 to 8 pages in. The author seems like a decent enough bloke.
B000YGIIPO|4.0|[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents is #28.]<br /><br />I wasn't convinced I'd like this book. About a fourth of the way through it still hadn't grabbed me, I didn't much care for the premise or the characters, and the story just seemed to drag. Then it picked up quite a bit, the plot gained some depth, the dialogue got more snappy, and generally the book got good. It's still not one of Pratchett's very best (ie, it wasn't ridiculously phenomenal), but I enjoyed it.
B001GF8WPI|5.0|One of my favorite will Farrow movies. Looks great on blu ray and still makes me laugh especially the whole guitar shop scene.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|An exciting, and interesting book. The story lines were easy to follow and kept you guessing until the end . Thanks David.
B00AYPXG5W|3.0|Lacking details making it a little far fetched.  Very disturbing scenes with no explanation.  Would not recommend to other movie watchers.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I was given this book to read for my Middle East History class and was kind of dreading reading it. Well I did not expect this book to become one of my favorite books to read of all time. The history and the way that the characters intertwine with each other is just amazing. The story line is sad but inspiring at the same time. Love this book and always recommend it to people to read.
0765325950|5.0|Combat is difficult to write, warfare even more so. I have no idea how Sanderson/Jordan managed to write hundreds of pages of compelling warfare. The majority of the book was dominated by the last battle and the battles leading up to it. Somehow, the authors were able to convey the drudgery and monotony of hand-to-hand combat, but kept things interesting by jumping between perspectives, following different types and styles of combat, and giving glimpses of overarching war tactics. Exposing the gamut of emotions helped keep me engaged--exhaustion from fighting, frustration with orders, respect for opposing commanders, tension with tenuous allies, pain at the loss of comrades, and the short-lived joy of small victories. As ever, one of the things that set this work apart from many other works of fantasy and fiction is the depth of culture and cultural interaction. I especially enjoyed the Aes Sedai/Ashaman intersections, the Seanchan interactions with Mat, Min, and Egwene, the wolf/waking world, and the Aiel/basically anyone else.<br /><br />The convoluted bits were really fun. There was just enough foreshadowed most of the time that the reveal was brilliant, and I could look back and think I should have seen it coming. The sheer number of weirdly interlocking plot pieces should have made the book impossible, but instead show just how rich the book could be, and how skilled Jordan (in conceptualizing things) and Sanderson (in executing them) were.<br /><br />There were a few frustrating things. The introduction of a few major forces in the battle felt more like plot devices for manipulating the flow of battle for the writing's sake, rather than integral parts of the story. There was some measure of deus ex machina a few times. The very ending was even more frustrating for me. There was not a lot of denouement and tying things up, and the ultimate ending for a few characters seemed not at all foreshadowed, and their actions seemed out of character.<br /><br />All in all, though, the book was strong and emotionally meaningful. Character deaths were impactful but not overly emphasized, and the authors didn't shy away from killing those who needed to die. It was a very fitting final movement of a great fantasy series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would not call myself a &#34;book worm&#34; to say the least, but, this one I could not put down. Mr. King kept you on the edge of your seat.

B002RI9HUM|5.0|Despite the subject (Addiction) I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I understand that Ms Keyes writes from personal experience and I believe that is what made this book such a good read. It was funny on the surface but did not fail to expose the horrors of various addictions. She always creates very believable heroins who, although flawed engage our sympathy. Another cracker of a book.
1416955070|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Somehow the fantasy elements set so seamlessly in a modern environment, with interesting and relatable characters was entirely compelling for me. I am getting tired of female protagonists who are wholly blind to romantic interests, though. It's getting old, and it was trying in this book. Some of the plot twists were clearly foreshadowed, but some were nicely hinted at but well-hidden. The writing isn't the very best and some aspects of the story are clearly derivative of other famous fantasy works, but I am looking forward to continuing the series.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I just need to access my subaccount (which happens to be my primary business email address) while on the go. Seems so simple right? It is, on the webpage version of yahoo. However, I own and Android Smart Phone, a Kindle Fire and an Amazon.com Nook Tablet. None of these allows me to check my Yahoo email sub-account. The apps have just left that option behind. At this point, I have spent hours trying to recover an older version of Yahoo (which does allow me to access the subaccount from the older Yahoo webpage version) but it keeps changing and taking away the only option that works. In this day and age, you would think this would be a no brainer. However, the No-Brainers that keep making sub-email account imposible on the go are really losing my loyalty, and with a quickness.

0060507772|3.0|[For context's sake, I have been reading the Discworld books in publication order. The Last Hero is #27.]<br /><br />One of Pratchett's shorter works, and I think it may have suffered for it. I felt like the plot wasn't fleshed out enough, the characters weren't really developed enough. We got some great insight and movement from previously known and encountered characters, and it was especially nice to see Leonard as more of a protagonist, but there were a lot of missed opportunities and things lacking. The wizard banter was sparse. Librarian jokes were few. The few interactions between wizards, priests, and the Patrician have been hilarious in the past, but although fairly plentiful here, they were brief and rather hollow. The interactions of the gods (especially toward the end when it sounded like they'd have more fun with it) were too short and too boring. It's a shame, really, because I thought the concept and the story were great ideas. What was up with the ending, too?<br /><br />(two and a half stars)

And this EP is a breath of fresh air, and this is coming from a guy who isn't into electronica that much. The songs are actually fun to listen to, and it has the feeling of a great hard rock record. The best song on here is Breakn' A Sweat, which features the surviving members of The Doors, and lots of ear-gasmic WUB! Go Skrill!

B0076DEJMO|5.0|I love reading Joe Abercrombie's books. The man weaves tales that pick up the rocks that we hide under and makes good people bad and bad people good. There are so many places in our world where strife and conflict exist, where people make the bet of the choices available to them, and Abercrombie writes novels that explore those people, those choices, and that world with such compassion that you're rarely able to point at a character and say &#34;good guy&#34; or &#34;white hat.&#34;<br />There is grit and conflict in the story and the characters. You can sink your teeth into the book, unless you get it as an audiobook or an eBook, and chew.<br />It's a great read. It twists and turns and keeps you company all through the night!

Historically no one at that point knew what heavy water was and how it was necessary to the development of a nuclear bomb because no nuclear bomb had been detonated at the point.  Basically this movie is a well produced, big budget, awesome full cast and crew of that episode.  If you demand historical accuracy, this isn't the movie for you.  If you're okay with suspension of belief and want to watch a fun movie, you've come to the right place...

I'm glad I kept reading because I think that this would have to be my favorite book so far. She was extremely brave and I tip my hat to her.. What that man and his wife done to her was uncalled for and he had no excuse. I just want to tell Jaycee if she is reading this to keep her head up the World can be a crazy place, but if she can survive that hell for 18 years I have no doubt that she can survive the outside world. She is a bigger woman than I could be, there is no way that I could survive through that. Of course you never know what you are capable of until you have to do it.<br /><br />Best of luck to Jaycee and her family !

B00005JKC3|1.0|Whose idea was it to let Ang Lee direct \\"Hulk\\"? Ang Lee directs movies like \\"The Ice Storm,\\" \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" not movies about radioactive green rage monsters!<br /><br />But for reasons that will forever escape me, somebody DID let Lee direct a movie about the classic comic book hero, the Hulk. And it is a disaster -- a ponderous, dull psychodrama entirely devoted to the Hulk's daddy issues. It's a prime example of how you can have all the best actors, but it does nothing if the director is all wrong. Seriously, who hired Lee for this? And what drugs were they on?<br /><br />Years ago, scientist David Banner (Paul Kersey, and later Nick Nolte) performed strange experiments on himself involving genetic material from various sea creatures. He inadvertently passed this mutation on to his baby son Bruce -- and when his project was shut down, he blew up the lab and tried to kill his son.<br /><br />Remember that from the comic books?<br /><br />Present day: Bruce (Eric Bana) is a bionuclear scientist who is working with nanotechnology, along with his ex-girlfriend Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). But then a lab accident douses Bruce with gamma radiation -- and that night, he transforms into a massive green monster. Unfortunately this attracts the newly-freed David's attention, and he begins trying to find a way to get the Hulk's powers for himself. First goal: endanger Betty.<br /><br />As Bruce struggles with his not-very-scary alter ego he also has to contend with Betty's fanatical father, General Ross (Sam Elliott) and the sleazy Major Talbot (Josh Lucas), who wants to somehow extract Bruce's power. But the biggest threat is Bruce's crazy hobo dad, who is determined to gain all of the Hulk's power for himself... and even more than that.<br /><br />I get the feeling that Lee has a lot of contempt for comic book fans. Throughout all of \\"Hulk,\\" it felt like Lee is spoon-feeding the audience, while also making sure that they are bored into a stupor by aspects of the Hulk that nobody cares about. At all. I do not care about Bruce Banner's crippling daddy issues, and I suspect no one else is either. I want to see him turn green and smash things!<br /><br />Even Lee's usually-brilliant direction feels lazy -- he constantly uses frames to let us know \\"Hey this is a comic book movie! Not a REAL movie I'd put effort into!\\" and one character's death is completely ruined when he turns into a two-dimensional paper cut-out. And the torturously long prologue ends up destroying all mystery for the rest of the movie -- we're just sitting around, waiting for Bruce to catch up on everything we already know. So the \\"shocking\\" revelations are just dull and anticlimactic.<br /><br />Lee also throws some stuff in that is so silly that it seems disrespectful. There is a Hulk rat and a Hulk poodle. A HULK POODLE. Silly haircut and all. And he can't even stick to the \\"angry=Hulk-out\\" formula -- there's a scene where Banner transforms for NO REASON other than a plot-convenient psychotic break.<br /><br />Oh, and does the Hulk smash? Occasionally. It takes almost an hour for him to actually smash something, and even then it's the Hulk Poodle and its friends. The Hulk himself looks utterly ridiculous -- a too-smooth green balloon with huge woobie eyes, bouncing lightly across the desert.<br /><br />One common defense of this movie is that it's a study of complex characters... but it's not. Banner is just a boring generic scientist, and Betty is a generic supportive love interest with little spine, despite Jennifer Connelly's best efforts. The good guys are pure of heart; the general, mad scientist and evil blond douche (I don't know why he's even in the movie!) are evilly evil with no virtues whatsoever.<br /><br />The one good aspect of it is that the actors, bless them, are trying. They're trying really hard. Connelly, Bana and Elliott seem to be pouring a lot of effort into making their characters work, but it's a futileeffort.<br /><br />If this were the first Ang Lee movie I'd ever seen, I would assume this man had no talent or knowledge of filmcraft, and was bribing critics to praise him. This movie is resolutely idiotic -- give it a pass, and check the 2008 reboot.effort.<br /><br />If this were the first Ang Lee movie I'd ever seen, I would assume this man had no talent or knowledge of filmcraft, and was bribing critics to praise him.

B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Sometimes it feels like there is nothing new in horror movies -- we just get remakes, sequels, and movies that rely more on gore and nudity than real horror.<br /><br />But sometimes... very occasionally, we get a movie like \\"Mama.\\" This is the closest we're probably going to get to a \\"La Llorona: The Movie\\" -- an eerie, creeping brand of horror that quietly slips behind you instead of leaping out of dark corners with a screech. And it doesn't hurt that the acting is pretty uniformly brilliant in this movie, even if Jessica Chastain's character arc is a bit predictable.<br /><br />After murdering his wife and business partner, a distraught man named Jeffrey (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) escapes to a cabin in the woods with his two very young daughters. He plans to kill them and then himself, but something destroys him before he has a chance.<br /><br />Five years later, the girls are found -- feral and naked, except for wreaths of flowers. Their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau again) immediately volunteers to care for them, although his girlfriend Annabel (Jessica Chastain) is a little more reluctant. Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) supports their custody claim and even gives them a McMansion to live in, as long as he has access to the girls.<br /><br />But something strange is afoot -- nightmares, moths and tales of someone the girls call \\"Mama.\\" After Lucas takes a near-fatal fall down the stairs, both Annabel and Dreyfuss begin to suspect that \\"Mama\\" is not just a coping mechanism, but something that spent years raising the girls in the woods. And she won't let anyone else take care of \\"her\\" children.<br /><br />It really annoys me when people insist that \\"PG-13 horror always sucks!\\" -- if it's done with atmosphere and skill, it doesn't need an R-rating or a big budget. \\"Mama\\" doesn't have a lot of jump scares or grotesque images -- it relies instead on a creeping sense of unease, draped in shadows, fluttering moths, dead leaves and sepia-toned decay.<br /><br />Andres Muschietti has never directed a full-length movie before, but frankly I'm dying to see what he comes up with next. He already has a lot of skill, such as the beautiful scene where we first glimpse Mama in the house -- a single shot of Lily playing with someone, as Victoria and Annabel drift in and out of other rooms. It's a quiet, unmoving shot, but we're left with the growing horror of knowing that SOMETHING unknown is in that room with a little child.<br /><br />And the horror really amps up when we finally DO see Mama. She's a twisted, shadowy creature with scuttling limbs and windblown hair, but she also elicits our pity for her madness and sorrow. She's a classic ghost, and every attack makes perfect sense.<br /><br />It also has some truly excellent acting from, well, EVERYONE. Coster-Waldau is absolutely heartbreaking as a man desperately devoted to his family, and willing to give up everything for his brother's children. Chastain also gives an excellent performance as Annabel, slowly warming up to the children as she slowly becomes aware that something supernatural is creeping into her new suburban life. The one problem: her transition from \\"rock chick who doesn't want kids\\" to \\"loving aunt\\" never feels quite natural.<br /><br />And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle N&eacute;lisse... wow. Both of them are absolutely brilliant, which is all the more impressive because they're so young. They give beautifully nuanced performances, especially since they have to act like feral children for awhile. Wow. Like the director, watch these children.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" is the kind of horror movie that deserves to be a classic -- a dark, twisting story that relies entirely on the most classic kind of ghost there is. Definitely a must-see, even for people who aren't a big fan of horror.uschietti has never directed a full-length movie before, but frankly I'm dying to see what he comes up with next.

The one problem: her transition from \\"rock chick who doesn't want kids\\" to \\"loving aunt\\" never feels quite natural.<br /><br />And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse... wow. Both of them are absolutely brilliant, which is all the more impressive because they're so young. They give beautifully nuanced performances, especially since they have to act like feral children for awhile. Wow. Like the director, watch these children.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" is the kind of horror movie that deserves to be a classic -- a dark, twisting story that relies entirely on the most classic kind of ghost there is. Definitely a must-see, even for people who aren't a big fan of horror.
B000UYJR7I|5.0|Love everything that Sam Jackson stars in.  he is a great actor and i look foraward to anything that he performs in.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I remember hearing sugar man somewhere and it brought me to watch this film. I always thought it was someone as famous as the beatles or Johnny cash, this man stands for the older generation of creative people that we will ever have the pleassure of seeing or hearing. There are no more real artists anymore, highly recommended and inspiring. A real human being.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The book was very entertaining and seemed nearly believable.  It was a fast read.  If you like a lot of technical and engineering-type dialog, you will enjoy this book even more.  I felt it got mired down in all the technical stuff, but did help to make the book seem believable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I couldn't put it down. First book I've ever read written by Colleen Hoover, but I plan on reading more from her :-)
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Refreshing! There is a hope for the contemporary pop music and that hope's name is Bruno Mars. Lots of passion and soul in his songs. Well done!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I didn't get to finish watching it.  However, I love everything that Denzel stars in.  He is a great actor and i look foraward to anything that he performs in.
1616550414|5.0|Very high quality product. Contains a lot of information and historical facts about the Legend of Zelda. All Zelda fans should purchase this wonderful book.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Easy to read.  Short chapters. The story was a bit predictable but still enjoyable.  For those familiar with South Jersey, the book is set in Collingswood (not Philly as I had heard), which was a plus for me since I live very close to Collingswood.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This whole series is amazing. The author does a phenomenal job at drawing you in and making you feel the emotions that the characters are feeling. It's sexy and the love story is incredible... a must read!
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|great
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I thought the movie was very funny. A little mushy but it was still hilarious. I recommended this movie for simple laughs.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I just love this g game. Fun to play. Make the time GO by.We can play together. Let's try!!! Yeah!!!
B005TZFZJC|1.0|No music worth talking about here, it's literally all garbage, it's basically one long, drawn out, crappy song cut into pieces.  Worthless!  The sooner people listen to real music that actually requires talent and no autotune the sooner this pathetic garbage will go away.  See the cover that's what it will feel like after listening to this crap, like you paid 18 bucks to have that done on your face like this manufactured tramp.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I used to play this on my iPod until my iPod was too old to support the game and i thought i would never be able to play this game ever again. Until i saw it on the android market. I absolutely love this game. I jus t wish we were able to send furniture as gifts.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This a gripping portrayal of a man's struggle with alcoholism and drug addiction, set in the context of an airplane crash and its aftermath.  The crash sequence is exciting but isn't the main point of the film.  It's a story about the unreasonable highs and profound lows experienced by addicts and the people around them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you love the Temple Run games, you'll love this game. It's a cute game that provides hours of gameplay. This is a must have game!!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|When I first downloaded this game on my kindle it was different. There was like more ponies. Then it seems they changed the format. After that for some reason it will not load properly on my kindle. It only loads half the screen and it won't get any larger, unless I remove it and redownload it and it will work fine, but as soon as I exit and try and come back another time, it does the same thing.  Also I hate the fact that you have to get so many things to move on. Like hearts gems, bits, harmony shards. There are way too many things to collect and I never can get hearts because I don't know anyone who else plays this game and you can't ask any other person to play either. On some games you can visit other's areas and leave a message and I can get friends that way.
B007FC3AAI|1.0|Take a series of crappy books and turn them into tween, boring, predictable movies and you get Twliight series.....YAWN!!!!  Im sick of even looking at the actors in this film, I want to punch every one I meet named Edward in the face lol.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is one of the best games I've seen her had an  trust me  I have had a lot of games before.  If u r looking for a good game... choose this one.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I've enjoyed the previous two seasons and the drama that is unfolding in a bit slow, but an evolution to what is to come so I 'suffer' through it. Overall I enjoy the trials and seeing the evolution from city slickers to hardcore zombie slayers and what each week will hold.
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|A friend of mine turned me on to Noel Gallagher and I'm glad he did. This is a solid album; each track is compelling and has a good driving beat, excellent driving music. Classic rock style with intriguing lyrics and catchy tunes. I recommend this for anyone who has been out of touch with the current music scene. Good bands are still popping up so leave that Pandora 80's radio station alone and grab this cd and enjoy!! Tracks 2 and 9 alone are a must have if you want to just sample.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|In the genre of reality television and shows that use promiscuity to get ratings as well as make one dumber while watching Downton Abbey is a wonderful televeision show to watch.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|This is a great film.  I am not a fan of the usual holloywood crapfests but this one really hit home.  It is actually super non stop funny, he touches on so many facts presented with satire as well as steriotypes from around the world.  Worth seeing by everyone who wants a good laugh and doesn't take themselves to seriously.  The rant on Dictatorship vs Democracy is hilarious and scary.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved the game subway surfers so much that right when it came out I had to get it!!!!!!!!!!it's a really cool game.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I could play (and have) this game for hours. The blocks are easy to see. The 3D effects are awsome.
0307950654|5.0|P.D. James has always held the top position in her genre in my opinion.  I admired the creativity she displayed by continuing the story of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;, using the language that Jane Austen would have used.  The intricate plot held my interest throughout.  I could not put the book down!  P.D. James was courageous in tackling the subject, considering the wealth of analyses of Austen's works and her loyal, devoted followers  She succeeded with taste and her usual excellent writing.<br />.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|For the price of the proudct I am very satisfied.  It's light weight and keeps the unit protect and clean.
B009P5S11G|1.0|Any fan of real quality music knows Rihanna sucks and is nothing more than a manufactured product.  Aside from that however I actually had to suffer through over half of this crapfest album when a clueless friend played it in their car.  This music even for it's talentless drone style has no flow, is all over the place, and just simply takes her regular suckfest music and even fails to match that.  Epic fail.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Goes hard in the paint. Really cool and makes you think. Everyone should have this application. Go get it and you will be amazed. It is swagged up a milli.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Great book. It left me thinking about it weeks after finishing it. If your looking for a serious concept changer (and you like sci fi) try this one out
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really loved this book. I don't go to the movies, so if a movie looks good...I buy the book.  I loved the story and the characters.
1608193381|5.0|THE QUALITY IS GOOD. no COMMENT FOR THE COTENT. NOW WE HAVE TEST ON THIS BOOK.:( But I think we do learn a lot from that
B001AX60KU|5.0|Great Elvis show with a nice box set remastering job.  Worth the piece and worth having in your collection if your an elvis fan.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|It was interesting, spell bounding.  It reminded me so much of my childhood watching the cartoons I loved.  It brought back a piece  of it.  I would watch it again with my little nephew.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|The performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are stupendous.<br /><br />The structure of the narrative is fascinating.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book in one weekend and could not put it down. Didn't see the movie but I just knew the book would be great. Oh boy...was it.  I am going to read it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game i thought temple run was fun but this is way better and its world tour so its in different parts of the world love it
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Actual plot and storytelling. Several characters are show more in-depth. Great cameo by another star toward the end. Skip the first and watch this one!
143911000X|5.0|Awesome little book on MALE PROTOCOL for almost ANY situation.<br />I bought 3, should have bought A DOZEN.<br />Great gift for any Manly Man!
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter was so happy when she opened the box for christmas. What more could I ask for?!<br />Oh, that I did purchase it for $20 cheaper than the stores.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found the story of the last book to be lazy, very predictable. The only book I really enjoyed of all three was the first one. The second one was ok, but the third one was very close to an obligation for me, just to finish the story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This Book Was One Of The Greats Books , Thank You To The Writer For Make More . PLEASE DON'T STOP !
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|wonderful series. I love the cast and the way it is done.<br />Hope they keep coming..<br />I will buy every DVD that comes out.
B003YBNREI|3.0|This is not really a Doobie Brothers album -- it's more like half of a Tom Johnston solo album thrown together with half of a Patrick Simmons solo album. That's why it doesn't have the famous Doobie sound (despite the return of original producer Ted Templeman) -- it just ain't the Doobie Brothers, folks.<br /><br />It frustrates me as to why they can't produce music that sounds like the old days (Toulouse, Captain, Vices, even Stampede), the music I fell in love with and still listen to 35+ years later.<br /><br />But I have my theories.<br /><br />In the old days, my theory goes, the boys would get together in a big room somewhere, and Johnston would say something like, \\"Well, I've come up with this here groove, what do you think?\\" And he would start laying down the licks to \\"Disciple\\", say, or \\"Road Angel\\". Pat and Tiran and the drummers du jour would listen and then instinctively fall in behind him, doing their best to add something interesting and flavorful as per their unique and individual styles and influences. Over time, as a BAND, they would end up with something distinctive and wonderful -- a Doobie Brothers song! -- composed of equal parts of Tom's soulful voice, Pat's punching ES-335, Tiran's soaring bass lines, the drummers' rhythms and counter-rhythms, and everyone's blended harmonies. Doobie magic.<br /><br />For World Gone Crazy, I'm guessing, Tom and Pat just showed up with a batch of fully finished songs they'd written over the past few years and demoed in their home studios. Nothing really for the other guys to contribute, other than going through the motions of playing their instruments or adding background voices. I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't even play on some of Pat's tunes, as there's nothing really for him to play.<br /><br />You don't hear any Simmonsesque influences on the Johnston songs, and vice versa, and most of all, you don't hear Tiran's bass, or even a bass in the driving style that our man Tiran would play. (Sounds like Speck Rhodesplaying one-five-one-five stand-up licks on the title track. Yikes.)<br /><br />What you do hear is a lot of plodding, over-produced, mostly second-and-third-rate material, most of it just forgettable, and some of it even embarrassing (&lt;-- Pat's sappy ballads).<br /><br />Speaking of Pat's sappy ballads. \\"Far From Home\\" and \\"I Know We Won\\" -- I mean, geez, they're ok songs to pawn off on some easy-listening American Idol runner-up country artist wannbe to cover, but they don't belong on a Doobie Brothers album.  Either tune easily bumps Cornelius Bumpus' \\"Thank You Love\\" off the top of the list as the most un-doobie song to ever appear on a Doobie album.<br /><br />On second thought, Pat's \\"Little Prayer\\" is even worse than \\"Far From Home\\" or \\"I Know We Won\\". It's now the official winner of the aforementioned Bumpus Bumper.<br /><br />The \\"Nobody\\" remake is ok, except that \\"Nobody\\" is a second-rate Doobie song to begin with (it took \\"Listen to the Music\\" to put the guys on the rock-and-roll map), which nobody really needed to hear again. Not a good sign that \\"Nobody\\" out-shines most of the new material here. Makes me wonder why they didn't just scrap all the new stuff and do a complete  remake of all of the songs from the first album. At least that would have been a better batch of songs, and worth listening to. Hint, hint.<br /><br />That brings us to Tom's \\"New York Dream.\\"  It had such high hopes. Kind of a Steely Dan groove. Tom's in fine voice. There are horns. Chord changes not all that Doobie-ish, but I'm buying it. Then. alas, the wheels come off: Tom starts laying down a rap. That's right, folks, Tom raps! Why didn't producer Ted insist on bringing in an honest-to-god guest rapper? Earlier on, after all, we were forced to listen to uninspired guest shots from Mike McDonald and Willie Nelson, so why not bring in Fifty Cent or Eminem to do Tom's rap? Wouldn't that have been a well-needed kick in the pants?<br /><br />Opportunity lost. Ted, you're fired.<br/><br />Guys, I wish this didn't sound so mean. I love you Pat, I love you Tom, (I miss you, Tiran). It's tough love, though. Someone had to tell ya.
1439102732|5.0|Jodi at her best. I could not put the book down! I love how she can make you think about life and she things from others point of view.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book, it's beautifully written; it pulls at your heartstrings.<br />I felt like crying for Victoria I felt like hugging her, then at one point I felt like hitting her.<br />Life can be cruel, a child without love is a crime, this story broke my heart. But then along came Elizabeth, she loved unconditionally.<br />Great read<br />One complaint, the ending could have been better
B005Q1W10A|5.0|wonderful series. I love the cast and the way it is done.<br />Hope they keep coming..<br />I will buy every DVD that comes out.

B00BHMETKC|4.0|Good movie.  Well paced and kept you on the edge of your seat. Arkin and Cranston were great. Aflec and Goodman very good as well!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I loved the movies and for $28.99 i couldn't resist buying them instantly. Brings me back to the good old days.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book makes you really think about what our warriors go through.  We should be thank ok by and helping our best any way we can
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have heard bits ans pieces of the plot but I never expected it to be this good! Brilliant book!
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|While I feel the quality of the movie was a little low budget, (it was dark the entire movie, not good lighting) the movie had me and my 14 yr old daughter so creeped out and scared. We began watching the movie at night, and neither one of us could continue, we had to shut it off and watch it in the daylight. Thats only happened to me twice in my life.
9706271821|5.0|Le&iacute; este cl&aacute;sico de la literatura en la escuela cuando era un adolescente. Ahora doy gracias a amazon por ponerlo disponible en espa&ntilde;ol. Esta versi&oacute;n s&iacute; tiene las ilustraciones y record&eacute; la enternecedora historia una vez m&aacute;s.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm a big fan of the TV series and after finding out that the tv series is based on a comic book I had to buy the first three volumes.  I'm hoping for more for my next birthday.  The comic book doesn't disappoint!  I'm very happy and now a fan of this too.  The 1st comic is crazy good and I was very happy with the purchase.
B001P1MZNI|4.0|Another special price from the vault.  Didn't hear most of these recordings before and was pleasantly surprised, especially by the spoken &#34;Tea break&#34;.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|It did what I needed it to do! It served its purpose! I was able to transfer music to my computer.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Honest lyrics Great Music!.<br /> Great Video Production!.<br />He Really Looks Like He's Having A  Good Time On The Thrift Shop Song!.<br />Love Their Stuff!!!.<br />THANK YOU GUYS!!.<br />P.S.<br />The digital booklet was never downloaded!, which I wanted...<br />TO SEE THE LYRICS!!.<br />Why I down loaded the Delux  version to start with!.<br />Too bad!!.
B007885IJU|5.0|Not only was the record brand new and incredibly affordable it even came with a promo card which allowed me to download the full cd to my computer
B001609SQA|5.0|A *MUST SEE* if you are into FPS (First Person Shooter) games like Halo or any game like that on your gaming console of choice.  This is a &#34;God Father&#34; of all FPS in my opinion.  25+ years later and it is still a great movie.  Hudson one-liners are classic throughout the movie.  :)
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Chose this rating simply because it's the best. I've read the books, so I realize what a challenge it must be to fit so much into a single season, but I was very impressed by how well the series stayed true to the book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|When I need to know the weather, it's right at my fingertips. Easy to access all the features like radar, satellite, local & extended forecast.
0345525558|4.0|I enjoyed learning more about the foster care program for 18 year olds and i was quite saddened by the lack of support the 18 year old gets once out on the street.  This main character did not have good skills and was so down on her self.<br /><br />The other aspect of the book was learning about the meaning of flowers. When I host my book club, I will make sure I have pertinent flowers on the table.<br /><br />Although the ending is predictable, I did enjoy the book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|As far as I'm concerned this was the best American TV program to air for the entire decade.  I still mourn the loss.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love anything Sherlock Holmes and anything English.  So, combined this was a great updated version of the Hounds of Baskerville.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This movie based on someone's real life experiences, it  brought on a variety of emotions,<br />And held my attention from start to finish.<br />The movie was worth the rental fee!
B007IK44CK|1.0|I have not been able to find help to resolve the networking issues with the app.  Will probably have to cancel my Prime membership if this isn't resolved quickly.
B0086O4FLC|4.0|It's the not the usual Metheny I have on  my records or that I saw live but wow is this music enjoyable.<br /><br />The opening track almost seems something that came out from a DeLucia/DiMeola/McLaughlin album. Just with a Metheney twist.<br />The second track is Mr Metheny at hist best. The reason why who buys his music loves him.<br />Then he just continues to play some cool jazz with a Metheny sound. And as usual his bandmates are awesome.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's his best work but it comes close. And as i said it's really enjoyable. I bought just listening to the 30 second samples. You should too.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Funny movie - enjoyed watching it as video on demand through Amazon Prime.  Not a family movie to be watched with kids - adult movie.
B00A6TYCNQ|1.0|The long and tedious battles are meant to chip away at your HP until you have to<br />pay more and more $ to survive.  Trust me.  If you want to beat this game it will cost you much more than 6.99.
0006486118|5.0|CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK.  WHEN WILL BOOK BOOK NUMBER 6 BE OUT? THE WHOLE SERIES IS TOTALLY ENGROSSING.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Still no Beetlejuice in site.<br />Love this film with Michael Keaton in it.<br />A sequel has to be made ... not a remake.<br />And only Keaton can play Beetlejuice!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Great movie - rented it as a video on demand through Amazon Prime.  Great picture quality.  Good movie with a good plot.  Clint Eastwood did a great job of acting in this movie.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie is awesome! Can't wait for #2. Watched from the comfort of my home, in my smart tv and Amazon HD.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it properly and you will not be disappointed.  I believe it is a great program that is well worth daily use.
B0013N7AD8|4.0|Batman, Batman Returns and Batman Forever are great.<br />Batman & Robin ... big let down and cop-cat of Batman Forever.<br />They could have done another film with more colourful villains to apologizes for B&R bad film-making.<br />Part 5: BATMAN BEYOND?
B007MLDC2I|1.0|Did not enjoy this movie.  It could have been a good movie if there was not so much focus on sexual content.  Will not suggest this movie to anyone.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|the show was great and its so nice to get the album to listen to<br /><br />it arrived fine and on time
0765325950|5.0|I love this series - couldn't wait for this one to come out.  Sad to see it end though.  Thx
B003O7I6SY|5.0|007 is Back!<br />and they have Sean Connery back as James Bond 007.<br />Great remake of &#34;Thunderball.&#34;<br />One of the best 007 film by Sir Sean Connery.
B00004W221|5.0|My daughter had seen the movie on AMC and wanted me to see if I could get a copy.  Well I did and I watched it about 3 times before I took it to &#34;share&#34; with my daughter and 2 grandsons.  I will look forward to its return.  Rudy is a movie I will watch many times.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|oh what a good album!!!! she makes u want to scream!<br />it arrived fine and no problems<br /><br />i love her stuff
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I have tried time after time to download this game...it will not download...I will keep trying but its frustrating...sounds like its worth it.
B002HYHZ9Q|4.0|I liked this 3D film, but I feel this movie was way to short of a film.<br />It needed to be longer.
1574216988|5.0|Sandy  is a wonderful writer always with a sence of humor and makes me smile. InThe way she givs hints makes you aware of how to see things and how to finish the exercise I have read the book so many times and see somthing new all the time.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Finally got to watch the whole 6 seasons.  Took me a couple of weeks.  Great imaginative scifi.  I had read that they changed the Dr so I was ready for it.  To be truthful it wasn't traumatic.  I liked both.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I can't imagine how horrible it would be to wake up every day and not be able to remember what happened during the last 20 years of my life. This book hooked me from the beginning. There were instances of bad language that I didn't think were necessary and the way she wrote in her journal was strange. When people write in a journal, they don't write down conversations word for word. In spite of that, I really enjoyed this book. When everything was being revealed, I had to put the book down a few times and take a break because it was so suspenseful.
B009O07NDY|4.0|Great Howard Shore music to continue in the same style as &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy.<br />Will there be a extended version of this movie soundtrack to come?<br />I wounder?
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The plot seemed implausible and juvenile even though I knew all about the events.  But, it is Washington and the CIA, so anything goes, eh?! Once the flight left the tarmac with the film director &#34;Tony Mendez&#34; aboard, I was all in!  The story came to life.<br /><br />It would be unfair to view the film and judge the Iranians as oblivious.  Hollywood is known the world over where stars are born.  Egos would love to be part of that moment of fame.  It is--what made the obvious oversights of the Iranian people believable.  The colorful language I could do without, it did not add to the story-line; just made me cringe.  This is a great movie; it deserves all the accolades and is worth a Saturday Night viewing!
B00171R00O|5.0|I liked this movie because it reminded me of my father, it's inspirational, it goes over what one has to put oneself through to make it to the top!  The picture is great as well!
B000Q79HS8|5.0|My 14 year-old and my husband loved it!<br />I found it nice and intriguing and we all loved the background tour around different European cities.

1476734941|5.0|this book reads very easily, my favorite parts about this diet (or lifestyle change) is there is nothing to buy, no special exercise, no special foods required, etc. I hope this diet catches on and helps as many others as it did for me. Although the weight loss is a bonus, the health benefits are the best reason to make the change.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I had no idea what to expect with this book. Needless to say, I laughed, I cried and I missed the characters for an entire week after finishing the book. I have been recommending this book to everyone; it is romantic, heartbreaking and full of honesty and love. I will definitely read it again. Thank you, Jojo Moyes for this amazing, beautiful read.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Who need the goon docks?<br />Who needs them?<br />We do ... that's who!<br />It's a great childhood adventure that I can remember when I was a kid myself.<br />Let go find One-Eye Willie's rich stuff!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It was paced perfectly to build suspense and dread in the reader. Seemed very well researched as well.  I found the behavior of the characters to be plausible, especially Cathy's behavior as the story continued.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|A great science movie. It is even enjoyable for adults. It teaches children about pollination and what would happen if bees didn't do their job.
0375869026|5.0|I loved this book.  The main character is a 5th grade boy who has been homeschooled up to this point in his life.  He goes to a private school for 5th grade.  He's very bright, but he has physical challenges.  The book is written from his point of view with additional chapters from the points of view of other characters in the book.  The main character is a charming young boy who seems  very real and down to earth.  I would recommend this book for either a boy or a girl who is or feels &#34;different&#34;.  This is also a good read aloud book, plus it's great for anyone with an upcoming change in their future.  My son doesn't read well enough to go to public school and is therefore homeschooled.  He is wanting to go to public high school in two years.  We used this book as a read-aloud addition to his homeschool curriculum.  This was excellent for us.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Look up in the Blu-Ray Sky ....<br />It's a bird, it's a plane ...<br />not it's SUPERMAN movies on blu-ray!<br />I hope MAN OF STEELE will turn out awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game. Addictive. Only small problem is when you get a notification it can stall the game a little. but worth it
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I first learned of Scott Jurek from the book Born to Run. He is a famous ultra marathoner. An ultra marathon is longer than a traditional 26.2 mi marathon. often 50+ miles.<br /><br />The book is interesting. It details his life and how he found running and what it means to him. He talks a lot about how his training program evolved over time and what he eats (plant based diet). There are many good narratives about his experiences running various ultras like Western States, Bad water (135 mi through Death Valley), and several other amazing distance events. He talks a little about form and training but mostly just how he evolved his plan. This book is not a how to running guide, but if you are interested in the sport, or in what the human body is capable of it is a good read. The end of the book has an appendix of various recipes for he likes.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen.
B005BDZN62|5.0|Best film of it's time!<br />Even tho it was way before my time.<br />Meeting Rita Moreno, George Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn and Robert Banas from that films great too!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Love the characters, the complexity involved in the notion of a &#34;Good Wife,&#34; and the great portrayal of a strong and caring woman lawyer and the ethical complications of both the legal and political worlds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very realistic. A lot of fun to play. Young or old you will enjoy it.  Close to the real thing without the cost.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was my first experience with a Gillian Flynn novel, which was highly recommended by a friend who enjoys the author.  The story would have received 5 stars, but without giving anything away, I wanted more at the end.  I am not sure what &#34;more&#34; would have been, but let's just say I did not like the end.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works.
B005I64U5C|1.0|Not one of Martin Campbell's best work.<br />The film was slow and draggy in its storyline.<br />Last word on superheros movie(s):<br />&#34;Why does (or at least one person) have to know who the heroes identity is?<br />I mean that why they have dual identities hidden behind mask!<br />It's DC Comics not Marvel Comics here!&#34;
B00433TO52|5.0|This cannot be beat for the price.  An easy and wonderful way to have the complete works of Shakespeare on your computer or tablet.
0143112724|1.0|Too much space was wasted by inserting unidentified &#34;art&#34; when vital info regarding the subject would be desirable.  &#34;Illustrated&#34; in the title implies, to me, examples would be shown--<br /><br />Live and learn, again.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|When you have a favorite author, it is sometimes easy to be let down but that was not the case with The Panther.  I enjoyed every word, from beginning to end.  It was well written, easy to put down and pick back up again, and wrapped up in a nice, pretty bow at the end.  My only complaint is that I know it will now be a while before another book comes out.  I'll wait!
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Good Dinosaurs trilogy on blu-ray ... can't wait for Part 4 now to hit the theaters.<br />Will all the original cast members be coming back for Jurassic Park 4?
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great app for the casual user or the pro. I use it on a Kindle Fire and so should anyone else with one.
B002QGSYRC|1.0|I had to put this down after 300 pages because I thought the book was so one sided that I felt that I was getting a distorted picture of the war. I have studied much 20th century history and was looking forward to learning about an area that I have missed, the Korean war. But the book wanders through at least 300 page of set up to the war that was somewhat informative but very biased toward the left. All of the Republican characters are evil and incompetent, and caused all the bad things to happen. All of the Democrat characters are noble statesmen, and whenever they do something stupid or wrong it is because the evil Republicans made them do it. Oh yea, and the China missionaries (the evil China Lobby) were running the country, much like the Jewish lobby runs it today.<br /><br />Of course, history is never like that. No one side of the philosophical spectrum is always bad and the other always good. So if you like history rewritten to meet your left wing political viewpoint (something like \\"Fiasco\\") then you will like it.  Sort of pulp history. But if your looking for real history with some sort of balance, then I'd look for something else.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Very upbeat, like a Broadway Musical.  The actors are having fun, so the audience does too.  Find myself humming the songs!
B002QGUFWE|3.0|I need to remove my finger from my mouth.<br />It's an okay music CD.<br />Nothing really to write about here.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|After a disappointing last album full of less melodic &#34;artsy&#34; songs, the &#34;Old&#34; Josh is back with some songs you can remember and sing along with.
0307346617|5.0|great boook especially if you like zombies. dont be fooled this book takes place POST &#34;Z DAY&#34; and is stories of people who had a part in the war.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|I served on a USN diesel boat in the North Atlantic in the 50's. I can only appreciate what these guys went through in that primitive boat during wartime. Unbeliveable courage to go back out there time after time defying the odds!
B001TH16DI|4.0|Captain Kirk and its crew are off to the find the universe secrets together on blu-ray.<br />I'm wondering if Paramount Pictures will make them in 3D blu-rays in the near future?
B00003INJ6|5.0|.....playing w/And The Address leading it off, my best friend and I could only say &#34;holy s..........&#34;.  These guys and Vanilla Fudge ruled the Power Hammond scene!!!!!!!!!!!!
140053271X|5.0|birthday present. works amazingly very sharp very clear. easy to read. prodcut was shipped fast and affordable would do business again
B00992CF6W|5.0|its amazing its awesome its just super dooper cool but its also a small world and who knows how many people play on it
B00881VLCE|3.0|When it works correctly I love this app. Lately it's been acting up. When I get on the app it won't come up. It's just black. The only way I have been able to fix it is delete and start over. This is super irritating!
B004GE81CK|5.0|.....great echo for Sgt Pepper!!!!!!  I was totally blown away when I first heard this in Summer '67.  This is a true &#34;closet classic&#34;!!
B003L77GRO|5.0|as i said before been following it since it came out and i love the series. bought it to relive the magic
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The music is great and he once again has put together great songs that really are enhanced by his voice.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|I enjoyed this period drama.  Quite a bit of sadness in each episode but well tempered with laughter and joy.  I thoroughly enjoyed all of Cranford.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This novel was great. It explored the side of mental health that nobody talks about:  Recovery!  Also the influence of how our childhood past influences our personalities.  Escape, facing reality, and recovery are the difficult journey taken by many in this position.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|absolyutely love this series been following it since it came out and i wanted to relive the magic by buying them
B00BHMETKC|3.0|After winning &#34;Best Picture&#34; I watched Argo and was somewhat disappointed.  Maybe I was expecting too much but there wasn't much build up and it seemed underdeveloped.  Maybe they tried to fit too much into two hours instead of developing the characters.  The climax when they were going through security which was supposed to be damned near impossible seemed fairly easy and uninteresting.  I wouldn't watch this again.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|super sound track;saw video on public tv fund raiser;also personally traveled to portofino..a wide range of singing styles for bocelli..
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my husband. We loved it for our wintertime entertainment. After reading all the books and viewing the all movies at the theater over the years, we were very pleased to have our own set to continue the quality of entertainment we enjoy and to share with others in the future.
0307277887|5.0|great book just to short for what i was expecting considering the tv series takes longer to watch than this takes to read. good book though
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really not a zoombie person but this show came highly recommend...I couldn't stop watching it ....it's better than 24 which was my favorite till this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This PBS series is one everyone in my family enjoys. Great character development and plots. A little bit of a history lesson wrapped in some wonderful story lines. Highly recommended!
B007I1QUYE|4.0|I recommend this trilogy because this &#34;super hero&#34; series speaks to the better nature of humans rather than the dark side. In all films,the evil characters displayed good values at one point or another, leaving the moral of the story one of choice and change. The final film was a bit weak in its presentation. It appeared the film editors were rushed or unconcerned in making especially the final scenes flow in a smooth story line to the end. I'm still glad I bought it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining and great acting, as well as story line!  At the end of each episode I can't wait for the next.
B005H9B44A|4.0|A blend of Sword ad Scorcery and modern day science fiction that I enjoy. Based greatly on ancient myth and modern science.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Bought this to get a correct battery life reading on my Kindle Fire HD. Really simple straightforward app, so easy to use.<br />Definitely recommended.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Having finally seen every movie, back to back, in the Blu Ray experience was definitely worth the buy. I put it in a gift card, within two business days I was watching Begins. The production artwork book is a film treasure I will hold forever. Thank you batman, for saving me from boredom and disappointment.
1582701709|5.0|got this to give as gifts to friends and cousins. can't wait for them to have it. good feel good book. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool I love it so much and I recommend it to who ever loves adventures and awesomeness,to get this games
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I love being able to read this great book at my convenience, Having e books is a wonderful way to have your library in hand!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Music You Will Listen To Over And Over Again<br />Al the songs are great. My favorite : &#34;Locked Out of Heaven&#34;<br />just can't get enough of this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love how the staff and family interact with each other. It was hard to stop watching. Itwill be a lng wait to season 4!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best<br />You should really get it<br />It is so good I would recommend this to you.<br />By Louis
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is just a wonderful series....the actors, the scenery, the costumes and the dialog.  I am also involved in a geneology project and it is so much fun to see how family members on the tree might have lived.
B0017IXOLG|5.0|Undoubtedly one of the greatest rock bands of their time with a sound so refreshing and so much their own. No matter which R.E.M. release you listen to, your appreciation for their music simply continues to grow. I'm fortunate to have been able to experience such an awesome band during my formative years as my preference for musical talent incorporates performers who are capable of playing an instrument as well as belting out powerful vocals. Although R.E.M. has disbanded, they will nevertheless LIVE ON!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games ever. It's updated frequently which makes game play more enjoyable as it's always changing and never the same. The only disadvantage is that the game is addicting!
B001974DG0|5.0|Half way through the book, stuck like glue !!!!!!! Love the way Dean Koontz jumps from caracter to caracter !!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|With my head in the sand, did not know about this series until it was in season 3....so I had some catching up to do!  Seriously recommend that you start at the beginning .....otherwise...there are a lot of twists and turns that you won't understand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|20 Words huh. WHERE DO I START UMM ITS SO GOSH DARN AWESOME I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THE UPDATE IS AMAZING IN ROME CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THAT<br />GOOGLE THE FACTS
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game. I love it so much that i have had it for about a year and played and played it over an over again. One night it quite working and I could not stand it until i uninstalled it and got it again. I have two games that I feel that way about. I really shouldn't waste so much time playing these games but I enjoy it so much. I got my brother hooked on it while we were at dads on  vacation. I really think most people will like this game as much as I do. Give it a try.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|i really like this product. the season 1 of new girl works great no scratches on it. cheaper than goin to a department store to get the season online here. very satisfied with it!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Pros - some are easy and some are very hard but between the two there are hours of fun and it is addictive<br /><br />Cons - I haven't found any but that's just me<br /><br />Suggestion - the company needs to come out with a second version because when you finish the first ones you want to continue.  I would certainly buy a second one.
1451695195|5.0|Outstanding.  I hope a lot of people read it and cease any fear of death.  It should make an interesting movie.
B0015AARJI|5.0|total confianza y satisfacción el un producto de excelente calidad el tiempo de entrega fue muy breve y estoy muy contento
B0091REZMW|2.0|I thought this would be more fun, but after trying to play it for a while it seemed to be just too confusing and I couldn't seem to get anywhere.  I won't be playing it.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was a geat book to take on vacation. Easy to read and follow. Looking forward to taking the sequal on my next trip in a couple of weeks!
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I like this little app. I've used it for travel and it is simple and clear.<br />I might even give up my satellite alarm!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I loved the way that Watney worked his way to survive and couldn't help thinking, what next is going to happen to this poor bastard (he's a real disasters magnet)?
141659521X|4.0|have read every book in this series of books and have not been able to put down any boojk that I have read
B009CPES4I|5.0|Just kidding.  The kind of story that you don't see the major studios make because it can't make them 100's of millions of dollars.  I'm glad someone was able to make this story.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Good action and suspense.  I would recommend it to anyone.  A+ A+ A+  A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+ A+
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show and could watch for hours (which I did). Acting is fantastic and the story is so properly juicy! Tons of fun to watch.
0061906220|5.0|and take a walk with Pete the Cat.  Absolutely Charming!<br />Little Max, my friend, had his Nannie read it over and over<br />during a ride to Grandpa's house on Christmas Day.<br />With Pete the (toy) Cat clutched in his hand.  It was a<br />magical car ride!
B00BESCJII|5.0|A great, timeless story of teenage angst and the horrors of high school...but with an ending that is slightly unpredictable, but great.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Incredible story. A wonderful sense of life combining God and nature. Such will to live and grace to conquer fear.
B007BVMVDU|3.0|I enjoy the production and acting on this series, but I think that if I hadn't read the books I would be really confused about who is who and what is going on.  Even with reading the books, it has been a while since I read the first one and I am trying to figure out who is who.  Also, I could do with less of the truly graphic nature of the sex scenes.  I was really hoping to love this series because I loved the books, but so far I am only sort of liking it.  But then again, I'm only up to episode 3.  I have heard it gets better, so I could come back and update later.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Very well done and I'm looking forward to the next season. Get it I'm looking forward to the next season like the show lol
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I've tried numerous times to install this app on my android LG Optimus T phone unsuccessfully.<br />Although the Amazon app store says that this app is compatible with my phone I can't get it to install.<br />After it finishes downloading it asks if I want to install the app...<br />I click &#34;yes&#34; and it tries to install but, then I get a message saying &#34;Did not install&#34;.<br />No other explanation or options available. Very frustrating.<br />Anyone else with same phone able to install this app?
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|It tended to be over the top though. There were times where it was just too much. But overall it was ok, funny enough to rent for sure.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This is a classic. I really like it. However, I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't as realistic as it could be. Hot guy with zillions of girls falls instantly and forever for a girl he meets only a time or two. I do like that theme and it's predictability but couldn't give 5 stars to be honest with those reading this review. Will say that it is worth reading and many give it 5 stars.
B000WTNCQI|5.0|I love this album. Simply the best of the group. The quality of the vinyl disc is impressiontante. The artwork is of excellent quality.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Loved to hear in his own words what really went on over in Iraq from a soldiers point of view.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|But not as good as the rest of the series. I like the action scenes, but the acting was as you would expect. OK.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great season! Best season of all 3. Also HD quality is worth it show looks great and effects are amazing, you won't be disappointed.
B002YVAT72|4.0|As a player is a great device. Although not used as a converter, because this is not my objective. Buffers that have feet help stabilize vinyl.
B004GYY714|2.0|I had problem getting in to radio Philippine station, just like its block, I do not have problem with other countries to turn in.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Had great intrigue and insight into what happened when they rescued those people in Iran.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I find having just a front view camera disappointing.  I like for Skype but for taking an actual picture, too hard!
B001N18HP0|5.0|The best album of the group. So do not understand why there are two discs of vinyl with the same songs.
B00A6L78YE|5.0|A really terrific album from an amazing band. It gets better with every listen! If you like tunes from guys like Richard swift you will really dig this album.
B009HELT3C|4.0|It was entertaining, I like the series so it was about on par with the rest of them. Will Smith is still funny here and there but overall it was a good rental.
B0084O8OB6|5.0|What can I say?This Is THE BEACH BOYS! Evan after all these years, you can all tell a BEACH BOYS SONG.I love the harmonies.And the way the song is built.Thier whole career is built on their love and respect for each member and their love of music.Brian and Mike can still write and sind some beautiful songs.If I could have changed anything......I think I would have made it a Double Album Release,
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Just when you think there is no more good things to add to the story, they surprise you with cartoons, gangsters, time travel,  and they will never die!?..
B008I43DYU|5.0|Highly recommend this calculator to everyone. I love the big numbers!! I have had NO problem with this app .  I use it at work a lot . Like it even better than my little calculator. I also use it to calculate a tip when eating out.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|So enjoyed this book!  I laughed, I cried.  The characters were so well-described, I felt I would know them if I passed them on the street.  Loved the Irish brogue, the tangents of Rose.  Truly a wonderful story!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Really no complaints about functionality, this works great for me. I just have two minor issues;<br /><br />1) Having to pay almost $5 for standard fonts... C'mon guys...  I have noticed weird annoying things with a's and i's, so what they've done is (in my opinion) released a $5 fix to the software you already bought.<br /><br />2) The devs seem to be slow to update on Amazon.  If it's the same price in both places, sad to say that play store may be the way to go.<br /><br />THAT BEING SAID, this is a great stand in for MS Office and everything just...works. I'd buy this again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|once i got this free app i was instantly addicted to it and it isnt a bad app to get addicted to it is a great puzzle app well worth getting i really recommend it :)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I avoided this before because after watching the first episodes I thought it was too derivative of shows like x-files. This is not the case and after the first season I am fully invested in seeing where the arc takes me. I admit it's geeky and unless you're paying attention you can easily get &#34;lost&#34; excuse the J.J. Abrams reference, but the acting and writing has kept me interested.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It keeps the mind working.  The puzzles are definitely worth a look but I don't know if I would purchase this app.
B003YJF068|5.0|In my opinion, this book provides the best practical guide on valuation and value creation.  Should be on every practitioner's shelf.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|just like with the help, i watched the movie first. the book is way better but they work together well. nicely done.
030758836X|4.0|Two kinds of readers will really like this book: Those who enjoy a novel that's structured to be a little bit \\"different,\\" and those who enjoy a mystery that keeps them guessing. Two kinds of readers will be disappointed: Those who need to have at least one character they can like and root for, and those who want the loose ends tied up in a tidy ending. Actually, I guess I kind of dip into all four of these categories! For me, though, the fun of reading  story that was engrossing and different outweighed my disappointment at a not-great ending.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|mr.depp is always a treat. sweet and kind, touching story with a good message. life is short, make it beautiful for the next person.
B000000XB9|4.0|I rate it four star coz as it is an old recording remastered. But it definitely better than the recording then. I love CCR N SANTANA even during my young school.days . Put it on good hifi set this cd can rock your house . I also recommend THE BEST OF SANTANA 30 th anniversary, superd digitally remastered.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|i don't usually like books that are more or less all about the writer BUT this is an awesome write. i only wish i had picked it up before chris kyle had been killed. this is definitely a must read for those who are totally clueless about this government and military.
B00846TTDG|3.0|Great story and action. Choppy and segmented. Didn't flow. Acting marginal. Fire fights Hollywoodish. Kudos to the operators for enlightening the masses.
0140120416|5.0|i'm the most indolent out of all the language learners. it's a hobby to ascertain foreign language skills and i want to do so without carrying 10 books as i do a sizable amount of studying on my commute. I don't have many opportunities otherwise and my commute is around 2 solid hours per day so I was looking for 1 and only 1 book to get me through a language effectively. This is it. Everything you would need to have a grasp on the language is wrapped in one paperback.
B005XN31LY|5.0|i am addicted to this show.  love, love, love it!  just wish i didn't have to pay for it, since it's on a free channel on my tv.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of kennedy's death, many speculations will pop up once more. i think putting it together with time travel is an awesome idea. it is difficult to say ... let him be with the one he loves or return him to his own time ... what would really happen. we will never know. awesome job
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a really good series with very engaging characters which make you want to tune in every week to see what they do.
1568363850|5.0|I love almost everything authentic so naturally, the Kana version would be my choice. I don't even enjoy fusion food as much. Anyway, as far as the series go, it's very practical and the text for the kana is printed as the written form would be, which is the correct way. I wish there were more practice examples as i'm frugal and don't want to spend more on a workbook but it is enough for a beginner like myself.
074356619X|5.0|listening to these CDs at least once a month, truly has changed my life and perspective.  reinforces positive thinking, they why and the how.  since listening to these CDs, over 2 years, I have seen an abundance of good things appear in my life.  They just now happen because I have changed my attitude and thought process.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My wife and I were absolutely mesmerized by this show.  Terrific acting, great plots and an ability to keep you off-balance as you progress through the season makes for stunning watching.<br />All of the actors are terrific and the awards received by Danes and Lewis are well deserved.  Additionally, Mandy Patinkin is terrific as Carrie's mentor inside the CIA.<br />The suspicion that there is a &#34;mole&#34; inside the government was briefly mentioned towards the end of Season One.  We are looking forward to see how this story arc develops during Season 2.  It will go a long way toward answering some of the questions we were left with.  In the meantime, both of us have selected who we think will be revealed as the &#34;mole&#34; later in the series.<br />Kudoes to everybody involved for creating this very addicting series.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A Beautiful read into the heart and mind of true amnesia. I loved reading pats story of healing and finally his return of memory...
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Just a great movie to watch when your down, or happy, or bored, or alone, or with someone else. It's just a good time waiting to be watched!!!
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I would like to see these graphic novels turned into readable books. The small print hurts my eyes. I like the art work and would still like to see it, but with the text separate. It also seems very short. I've never read a comic or graphic novel so I'm unaware of how long they are. It seems like a waste of money to spend $8 on a digital book that takes me an hour or two to read. I love the show.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Interesting game, enjoyable,gives your brain a workout searching for items. Gets frustrating when can't find the items your after. Recommended if you like to search things out
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|The LinkedIn application for Kindle Fire, is only half useful. Most of the functions, are not available, and require logging on through the web. It kind of defeats the purpose of the Application. Another frustrating thing: One will work hard to have a nice profile; listing Resume/CV, Skills, Accomplishments, etc... You also have access to recommended jobs. The problem: Why can a person not apply for open positions, by simply submitting their LinkedIn Profile for consideration? LinkedIn could at least have a profile download tool, to format and save a profile in the Resume/CV format. Much improvement is needed!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Incredible book. So well written and beautifully told. Pat and Tiffany are two of the greatest characters I've ever had the privilege of meeting. This book is definitely one of my top ten.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Ordered in December 2012 It did not come with a CD, I  used it for about three tapes to digital media.  Started humming and making noise when using to digitize the tapes. Sadly the unit was not returnable for a full refund due to the time past, and the shipping and hassle is not worth 25.00 I spent. Is useless and I will not ever buy from this vender again.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|Most songs ok.  Some so jr. High school level it is too irritable for adults to listen too.  Her previous albums are way better.  Skip this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my way of calming down.  So fun. I have been playing this game for years<br />and this is one of the best.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|My freind like the cd  lot kiss is a good band to list to because they rock  I like their music james
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|It one to watch again and again... ironically!  LOL  It is funny and warm and has a great message for all of us to take to heart!
B002WIDRM6|3.0|Like the album.  Not familiar with all the songs but very nice easy listening band, even if you don't like country music.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I could not stay awake for this AT ALL!!! Too bad because there seemed to be some talented singers that I woul dhave liked to hear sing but the movie was soooo boring that I didn't get to hear any of it and I didn't even finish watching it ...
B002G1YPH0|5.0|For the price (I paid around $20), this could very well be the best cooler for your CPU. It is not the most attractive looking cooler and the fan that it comes with is not the quietest either (for some this is an issue and for those people, I suggest buying a [[ASIN:B008N367IA Cougar Vortex PWM 120mm Case Fan in Orange]])<br /><br />This cooler is pretty big, so this will not be very good for smaller enclosures. Having said that, it definitely is smaller than [[ASIN:B001KUV2KQ Cooler Master V8 - CPU Cooler with 8 Heat Pipes and Mirror-Finished Base (RR-UV8-XBU1-GP)]], which is huge.<br /><br />It definitely beats the pants off any stock cooler and a worthy upgrade. There are better air coolers on the market, but there is a reason this one is recommended highly- the value of this product exceeds all but the most expensive cooling setups on the market.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|This is an intriguing and interesting portrayal of a couple who each have their own demons and how they help each other with life's challenges.
030758836X|1.0|This book was one of the biggest disappointments as far as books go, in a long time.  I won't spoil it, but the ending was the worst ever and it actually made me mad and disgusted with myself: I wasted all my time with this book. I actually wanted to cry at my wastefulness...let's face it life is short.<br /><br />The premise was good I thought, so I started it up.  The first thing I noticed was the writing was very annoying, almost like the author was writing about herself and trying to prove how clever she is but sounding very annoying.  I stuck with it.  I'm a sport.  I figured it had to play out, to give it a chance.  I did and it didn't play out, it didn't conclude, it didn't do anything but make me very angry.  Don't waste your time.
B000002L7R|4.0|I have Prince's first 8 CDs.  I love them because they were just fantastic and they remind me a great deal of my youth.  This CD also has some great moments.  It didn't blow me away, but it is good.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I love this series and was very pleased to be able to watch it on Amazon prime.<br /><br />My only issue is that I watched season 1 on netflix with closed captioning and enjoyed it much more that way then watching on Prime with no CC offered.<br /><br />Cmon, this cant be so hard to add.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This could have been a maudlin tale or one of sexual exploitation but it wasn't. Instead, it was a masterful treatment of a sensitive subject, told with with wit and tenderness. One of the best movies I've seen in years.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Fascinating look behind the scenes of the music industry and many of the greatest albums & musicians of all time. Also very interesting commentary on the value of human interaction versus technology as well as the role of &#34;fate&#34;. I'm not a Nirvana fan but I am a Dave Grohl fan!
8866137634|5.0|I dig how i can sketch and keep them organized, using the Sakura Micron Pens on it, does not bleed thru the page.
B001HADE00|5.0|Just imagine yourself driving down the road in a late 70's Camaro with this album blasting through the speakers.That's what life used to be like for me.This album was one of the first ten metal album purchases I made and it is still enjoyable today.Great riffs,catchy choruses,blistering solos,top notch vocals,it's all there.Stephen Pearcy may not have been the most gifted vocalist,but he really does a great job here.Songs like,&#34;Round and Round&#34; &#34;Lack of Communication&#34; &#34;Wanted Man&#34; and &#34;Back for More&#34; were fantastic and were the radio staples,but the whole albums rocks.I especially like the uptempo songs,&#34;She wants Money&#34; &#34;I'm Insane&#34; and &#34;The Morning After&#34; and it shows that Ratt could play fast as well as slower paced songs.Bobby Blotzer's drumming sounds great on &#34;Scene of the crime&#34;.Every song is a winner and it would take a few more years until 1990's Detonator for Ratt to make an album as perfect sounding as this one.<br /><br />I think Out of the Cellar is one of the first wave of albums that brought heavy metal music into the mainstream in 1983-84 with its catchy hooks and it's trademark guitar wizardry from Warren DeMartini and Robbin Crosby and a lot of rock fans who were previously fans of bands like Rush,Loverboy,Night Ranger,Asia,April Wine and Boston had now graduated to  the more aggressive sounding metal and were buying albums from hair bands like Twisted Sister,Motley Crue,Def Leppard,Quiet Riot and of course Ratt.The hair brigade was on!This album is a must have for Ratt fans and for anyone who is a fan of hard rock or heavy metal music.It doesn't really sound dated or fall out of favor with me and just the album cover alone brings back fond 80's memories.There will never be another decade quite like it.Highly recommended purchase.
0871404133|5.0|Wilson's thinking about human socializing seems quite<br />unique and his analysis has explanatory power for<br />how humans have &#34;conquered&#34;, overpopulated, and<br />crowed out other life forms
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed this when I was in India so saw all episodes when I returned.  Great story and acting. Love Maggie Smith.
1451695195|4.0|This book is very interesting with information relating to things that I have also personally experienced (there are definite parallels).  The power of love should be the biggest takeaway.  Its a short read (200 pages if that) and again, very interesting, but would have been better if less pages spent relating to technical aspects of his medical health, etc., and more devoted toward his spiritual experience.  But not all that surprising as he is a neurosurgeon!
B00940XIGU|5.0|This is a great album. So many hit songs on this. I purchased this and another of his albums. 5 star
B000V63AVY|5.0|If you have only one Supertramp album this should be the one!! Rodger Hodgson's voice is classic and the hits are all here.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I absolutely love this book and all of the others from the  series<br />  YOU MUST READ THIS AWESOME BOOK SERIES!!!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I would not recommend it to any of my friends. I found it to self serving. I have read better books about this subject.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very good, although I wish I had seen it before the Oscars.  I was expecting to be more blown away, but nevertheless the film is solid with a fantastic cast.  Arkin and Goodman were amazing. All in all the whole cast was very believable.
1844137872|5.0|Everything you would expect and want from Banksy. If you don't know Banksy's work, it is definitely something to admire. Get the book, you'll love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is awesome because I love horses and you can name your pet and customize it :)<br />It is fun and very cool I also love the fact that it is free I always love games with the animals :)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great flashlight!!! Whenever I'm searching for my keys in my big ol pocket book I just turn on this flashlight on my cell phone and it shine bright like a diamond in the sky (rhianna)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Impatiently waiting for Season 4. Wished they hadn't killed off Matthew Crawley just when he and Mary had their baby. He will be greatly missed from the series.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is a great book if your into the series. Very suspenseful can't wait for the next one The House of Hades.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|This download would never load correctly; played for a minute, then choppy. Then couldn't get video to load at all. Didn't want to spend more on HD version, but figured out that all these episodes are on [...] for free
B004GJDQT8|4.0|It works and makes it easier for me to shop on Amazon when using my tablet, I'll keep it.<br /><br />Thanks
B00APUQRPC|4.0|If you love baseball you will enjoy the movie. Another look at Eastwood in a different role. I would recommend.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I highly suggest you buy this book because it has adventure, action, and most importantly, comedy. Greg is just your average boy who has deal with his annoying brother, Rodrick and his annoying band, Loded Diaper. He is helped, attacked, embarrassed, and even depanted,Best book evrr
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|It's been a long time since I rated a movie with two or less stars. I'm a pretty easy sell on sci-fi/fantasy/gaming stuff, too. I don't even know where to begin with this one. Boring and incoherent come to mind. Check out IMDB for more reviews. It's hovering around five stars there, which sounds about right.
B000FA5QEK|5.0|This eBook was inexpensive. This read is very motivating. It explains what I want my future to entail; success that is.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Fantastic. I have to learn Italian. The best voice in the world. I wish he sang more in English, I'm in love
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Works perfect w/my new Kindle and know I'll really love it as time goes by.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone who is wanting a Kindle case.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|GET THIS APP! it is amazing! you can make your own collage and post photos, follow people,etc. It is fun and awesome! if you get this app you will not be disappointed! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I know understand why everyone has read and loved the s books! It takes you on a journey never thought of.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Great chess engine. Very hard to beat. But can't stop games during play and resume at a later time. Have to start and finish game without leaving the app.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I don't even see a download button. This sucks.something needs to be done about this.ASAP my son and I are really disappointed.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|If you like a lot of action and guns and stuff, this is a good movie.  Predictable in the sense that most of these movies are, but still fun.
B00003CWPR|5.0|This is an overlooked film. It is an odd and weird film but still interesting. I've never seen a movie like this before. One of the few movies I actually liked Tom Cruise in. It's a film that makes you think and that is a good thing. This is a great film for any fan of psychological thrillers. I think the movie is a masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick was a great director.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack holds the gear I want and does not feel heavy on my back.  There is a slot for everything, and things do not shift around.
1611134226|2.0|do I keep listening to Preston & Child?  This is the eighth novel of theirs I have listened to and I always ask myself the same question.  The only reason is that I like one recurring character:  FBI agent Pendergast.  Rene Auberjonois is excellent as a narrator, but this story is awful, the characters are poorly developed, the concept ridiculous, and one side-story has no relevence at all.  I'm sure this will be the last P&C I will subject myself to.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Not sure I ever figured out what was going on.  Slow moving and bizarre turns.  Don't recommend it.  2 more words.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I really enjoy this series.  It was the beginning of other shows that have followed over<br />the years.  The servants make the show.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It reminds me to charge my kindle before the battery gets too low. With everything I have  going on, I have to be reminded of a lot of things. It tells you how long you have to charge your device for it to be fully charged, so you can avoid any over charging. It even tells you when the \\"battery is fully charged.\\" In case you were wondering, yes, it is worth it!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Not only is the story incredible and moving in every way, the filmmakers did an amazing job of illustrating the narrative with snippets of animation and an attention to visual detail that is rare. This level of artistry is rarely associated with documentary film.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Good action flick with a different twist on the cop drama.  Too violent for me, otherwise i would have given 4 stars.
B0074OWHKG|5.0|Easy to install; great looking; and quiet.  I like the fact that I can change the patterns on the LEDs or turn them off if I wish. Pretty cool item to you case and your CPU will do better with this air cooled gem.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Season two was even more gruesome than season one. Asylum is like a roller coaster ride that won't stop until the final episode.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|After all of these years, this was my first time watching the entire movie. I have seen clips, but never the whole thing.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I really enjoyed it, but it's a simple caper film with period piece clothing and appliances (the number of phones with cords was really disconcerting).  Good acting and directing, but the scope of it is small.  In the end, it is entertainment and not much more.  I was not inspired, moved or need to think about it after I turned it off.  Had it not been given the Academy Award for Best Picture I'd be rooting for it as a smaller picture that should be seen.  It's fun and tense.  Instead, if you're only seeing it because of the award, you should take your expectations down a notch; then you'll get a kick out of it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show. I'm so hooked. And it's amazing that I can watch it on Amazon Prime for free! Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Couldn't use it on an android. Had to go to a different site to get it for android instead of kindle

B000IDEQTK|4.0|I am a fan of Helen Hunt so I wanted to see this movie....it was visual and story line was ok nothing outstanding but an enjoyable watch...I figured out the twist before it was revealed so that always displeases me!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was absolutely wonderful !!! A must read!! I can't wait to see the movie so that I can compare the book to the movie.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|When I downloaded this, I wasn't aware it was coloring sheets for toddlers, I thought it was a paint app like what comes on computers. But it's really cute for toddlers. :)
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I read this book back in Middle School as a required reading and I absolutely loved the story and the characters. After hearing the book via Jeopardy the other night, I decided to pick it up again. It is as magical as I could remember. Take it from someone who isn't a big fan of reading, this book will make you think and possibly make your heart melt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I liked it because it works for when i have nothing to do. I dont really see anything wrong it now.
0545265355|5.0|These books were fantastic and are a must read! Plus I loved the box they came in. So easy to store them and even display them. I'd recommend this to everyone!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my Kindle for Android app! I'm reading books that I love on it, and getting the full effect I would from having an actual book in my hand. There are two suggestions I could make. One is sometimes the words in the book are incorrect, and I don't think it's a typo, because some of the sentences are a mixture of the English language and I think it was French. I've only found two sentences like that. My other suggestion is that maybe the books could be a little cheaper. I don't have the room on my Android tablet to keep all of my favorite books, so I might have to delete them in order to download others. That's a little bit of a waste of money on my part. Thanks for hearing my comments and suggestions!
B0073B587E|5.0|Unlike the fender mustang guitar hero/rock band midi capable controller, this controller actually allows you to tap, so you can do two hand tapping techniques with this. I use Music Studio, Garageband, SampleWiz etc to create great synth tracks with this. You can send MIDI via WiFi into your laptop. This also allows you to use the 3.5mm headphone jack at the same time so you can jam with the built in speakers OR headphones OR output to an amplifier source.<br /><br />I wish this controller included a headphone extension cable, if you buy this controller you will need one sooner or later. Without it the headphones are too short (for your normal general earbuds etc). I paid $65 for mine and even at that price it was worth it. For the new lower prices this controller is a steal.<br /><br />It works with waaaaaay more apps than the cheesy guitar app it comes with (I dont even use that junk) and it is a blast.<br /><br />The only other \\"problem\\" with this controller (other than it is a bit plasticy feeling) is it is very hard to find a suitable carrying case, although it does allow you to detach the head-stock and neck. I have 2 of these so I can hack up one of them and customize it.  I am looking into re-painting and maybe even sticking the guts into a wooden body and at this price you can afford to experiment!  I have a Yamaha EZ-AG, a Yourock limited edition II and a keytar controller and this is still my favorite guitar MIDI synth controller. It is so convenient to just pick it up and jam (I leave an old junky iPhone in mine 24/7 so its good to go) and its great fun. Check out youtube for the numerous videos. There is also a guy who made a custom app for this, and hopefully he will release it soon.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I love this series and can't wait to read number 3... best books ever. If you like a little magic, mystery, love, adventure, sadness, conflict... these books have it all.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|definitly would play more. long and complicated puzzles to keep you entertained throughout the whole game. couldn't put it down. addicting beware!!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! Very fun. Got it because had seen others enjoying it. Very funny! Simple too, so younger people can play also.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wow is all I can say at this point, I could not stop reading this book. From page one the story takes the reader to a different place, and I was in Philadelphia with the main character. All his troubles and trials seemed liked they were my stories I was telling in third person. If you are wondering if you should read this book, wonder no more.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I almost didn't read this book because of the title... it sounded cheesy. &#34;Kingkiller Chronicle: The Name of the Wind&#34;, meh. BUT it just so happens that this book is my most favorite book of all time. I LOVE it! The second book is also amazing, and I can't wait for #3. Read it, and you won't be sorry!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is crazy good! I have been a fan of Smallville since it came out and a fan of superheroes since i was born!! Green Arrow has always been one of my favorites! This story line shows a darker side of green arrow but i love the scene of him on the island..every episode had me gripped and wanting more!! Its gonna be a sad day when the season finale is over and i have to wait for the second season

159114325X|5.0|As an illustrator and builder of model warships this book provides details of most German captial ships that are difficult to discern in other publications and photographs.  The hundreds of rare photographs tell stories of each ship described and depicted.  The two authors have gone to remarkable lenghts to create a book that is compete and a page turner. The book is published by the Naval Institute Press which guarantees its quality and accuracy.

B005QBBCMI|5.0|Accurate portrayal of addiction. Great acting by Cage and Shue. Hard for anyone who hasn't been there to comprehend the horrors of an overpowering addiction; and Shue brings compassion, if not understanding for the life she's in.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I'm impressed.<br /><br />I'm not \\"new\\" to the Quinn sisters, but I'm new to them. I guess what I mean is that I'm familiar with them, but never actually sat down and listened to one of their albums straight through. I don't exactly know what it is about them that just always sort of disinterested me, but, whatever it was, worked. I stayed away for a long time, even through excellently reviewed albums like The Con. I guess I was always a little soured on female vocalists (it's not intended to be sexist or anything, even though it kind of sounds that way), but that;s changed a lot recently with my admiration growing for bands like Company of Thieves, Sleigh Bells, Veronica Falls, Stars, Blondfire, etc. that all have female vocalists front and center.<br /><br />And man, I really wish I would have hopped on this wagon sooner.<br /><br />To me, Heartthrob is a damn near perfect pop/alternative record, even though it's not exactly what I would normally go out and search for. That should have been reserved for an album, again, like The Con; it was more \\"indie\\" leaning, which is more my preference. I don't exactly love that glitchy dance noise, but Tegan and Sara do it right. It's a perfectly meshed, harmonious sound, because, in the wrong hands, it could sound like total crap. It makes you feel good listening to it, even if a lot of the lyrics buried deep within that sound aren't exactly the most upbeat. But I'll always remember what Dallas Green (City & Colour) once said. I'm going to paraphrase here, but it was something along the lines of \\"I like to listen to sad music sometime, because it makes me feel better.\\"<br /><br />And that's what this album does. It makes you feel better. From the get go with the phenomenal first track/single, \\"Closer\\", it sounds like the 80's are back and New Wave never left. It's got this pulsating beat and the girls telling you that, yes, it is okay if you come closer. This sounds like the kind of song you would play in a montage during aJohn Hughes film starring Molly Ringwald circa 1985. And, really, that's okay.<br /><br />From there, the album doesn't really let up. \\"Closer\\" is really one of the most uptempo songs on the album, as there's a few ballad types in there, but it's all very solid. Some of my favorite songs on the album are the aforementioned \\"Closer\\", followed by \\"I'm Not Your Hero\\" (the lyrics in the song are absolutely awesome, by the way), the breathy, sing along song that is \\"Drive Me Wild\\", and \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend\\", which is the perfect break-up song for a partner and/or friend.<br /><br />Learn from my unreasonable distraction from this band and get into it. Long time fans may be a little turned off by the seemingly new direction the girls have taken, but it's totally cool: they don't care, and neither should you. It's good music by good people.

1592407889|5.0|WOW!!!  If all of this is true...I would have never have imagined Shirley MacLaine to be like she is portrayed in this book.  I think she is a great actress and I still do. I believe in some of the \\"New Age\\" thoughts and give her credit for getting these beliefs out into the world for consideration and I still give her that credit.  I admire her for making it in Hollywood from the bottom to the top.<br /><br />I admire the daughter for surviving alone...with sanity, a sense of worth, perspective, clear sight and humor.<br /><br />The Father is the scum of the earth and should have been put in prison for the rest of his life...maybe he was, I am not finished reading it. He is a criminal ...a con artist!<br /><br />I can't believe Shirley MacLaine could be so stupid to believe this guy and his clone story and would keep sending him all that money.  That is bizarre.<br /><br />Shirley was not a great parent...and she is very very closed minded and set in her ways...but there still is time to turn things around and enjoy the daughter and grand kids in her final years. I suspect the daughter wrote this book now as one last attempt to blast away all the blocks and get through to her.  She seems to have tried everything else. I hope it does not back fire.<br /><br />Earth to Shirley MacLaine....WAKE UP!  APPRECIATE AND ENJOY YOUR DAUGHTER AND GRAND KIDS....AND GIVE THEM SOME OF YOUR MONEY FOR GOD SAKE!<br /><br />Interesting story...very unexpected twists and turns...Good Luck to the daughter whatever happens...
B0094K1WZE|4.0|If you are a fan of  Mission Impossible you will want to see this. It had great special effects and it needs yo be seen on a HD television.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I hate the way the companies do the digital copy. It is only good on one computer. Otherwise it is a great set and Awesome movie.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Very much to the point, and gets you to reevaluate your interactions with individuals everyday in a more positive manner.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Puzzles are enjoyable. Background for puzzle pieces is often too dark making it hard to see the shape. Upon opening when you have more puzzles than the basic set it will lockup and you will lose all the other puzzles you have added because you have to download it
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci weaves his characters together in a crafty way. He develops a page turning plot that keeps you entwined until the very end.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show has elements that remind me of The X-Files (one of my favorite shows of all times).  The inventiveness and unpredictable scenarios keep me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait to watch ALL of episodes...and all of the seasons.  Plus, I'm super-happy that this season is included in my Amazon Prime membership (I hope other seasons are as well). :o)
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|Recently saw this on Netflix.  It's supposedly a remake of one of the same title that the Brits made in the 90's, which I have a copy of.  It's definitely not a remake despite it's pretentions otherwise.  It has the names as part of the executive producers the writer of the screenplay and the book author of the Brit series, but that's as far as it goes.<br /><br />The main character played by Spacey is a socio-psychopath much like many actual politicians as is his wife.  They are actually like Billary - Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are also present day manifestations of 2 Biblical characters, Ahab and Jezebel, therefore, Spacey and his wife, played by Robin Wright are likewise a present day Ahab and Jezebel.<br /><br />Way toooo much bed hopping explicit sex as with most American movies of the same genre, which is unnecessary.  I fast forwarded through that scum.  A lot of unnecessary scenes which don't advance the plot in any way..Spacey, as pol Francis Underwood goes back to the SC military academy he graduated from to speak at a dedication for a library founded in his name and he and several of his school mates get involved in a drunken spree in the old, now closed library building, pushing each other around on wheeled book carts, crashing into each other like go carts, throwing empty liquor bottles around, typical adult teenage activity.  Superfluous in my view.<br /><br />Another thing , at the end of the final episode Spacey and his wife go jogging in DC in the middle of the night....RIIIIIIGHT.  Crime ridden DC with it's \\"diverse\\" criminal class being very active, like most criminal classes, AFTER DARK, is just the place for a white couple to go jogging.  Horse patuey.<br /><br />The basic story itself, I liked.  I think the Brit version is much better.  The idea of the main character speaking to the camera as established in the Brit version and continued here, wherein he expresses his hidden thoughts to the audience, is very good.<br /><br />Too many F words and other profane slang sex talk which are not necessary to the plot.  I don't think Francis Urquart in the original said one F word, in this one, all sorts of profanity rolls off his tongue, in the form of threats, etc.  I'm sure the writers think it provides \\"realism\\" and character development; showing the evilness of his character, etc, but the original was fine without it.  It defiles the souls and minds of the audience.<br /><br />I held my nose when I gave it 2 stars.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This actually has character development to go along with all the action you'd expect form a Bond movie. I found myself rooting for Bond instead of merely watching him kick butt.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|This is a gruesomely stupid movie with blood spurting in copious amounts.  The same guy gets killed two or three hundred times.  The sound editing is poor.  Russell Crowe is sleep walking.  Tarentino must have been really stoned.  All time bad movie.
B009NX88JU|4.0|First of all, I want to commend this movie for its historical accuracy. _Almost Famous_ mostly takes place in 1973, and all the music is from 1973 or earlier.<br /><br />Kate Hudson does a standout job as the &#34;band-aid.&#34; She follows the band around because she is a fan. She also a charming relationship with the main character. Hudson's character is convincing and lovable, in spite of her obvious issues.<br /><br />Patrick Fugit does a great job as the teenage lead. He is based largely on the real life of Cameron Crowe, who also went on the road with the Allman Brothers as a teen.<br /><br />One can tell that Crowe care deeply about this film. It shows throughout. It seems that this film comes from Crowe's own longing to be cool. You won, Cameron Crowe--you made a cool movie.<br /><br />This also features an early role for Zooey Deschanel. She is charming as always.<br /><br />Frances McDormand does a great job as a the uptight, overprotective mother.<br /><br />It's a fun movie and a very realistic portrayal of life on the road. I definitely recommend it.
B004ULNJIU|4.0|I like this style om movie. I have several movies with tis actor. This DVD is one that did what I wanted and is a good buy.
0316067601|5.0|great story, a very hard book to put down. that it's a real life story makes it even better. loved it
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|What can I say other then the same thing I said before, QUALITY!!!!!! Our Granddaughter says that she feels like a Princess. We also loved the gems, it adds a 3 dimension feel to them. We would tell everyone to buy these, it's totally worth it.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|_American Beauty_ is one of the most quotable movies ever. The one-liners are insightful and pungent and reveal truths that we aren't always comfortable with. My favorite is: &#34;Never underestimate the power of denial.&#34;<br /><br />The actors all do a great job, with Kevin Spacey standing out above all. Every character is shown with depth, and it is easy to understand their struggles and desires.<br /><br />Mena Suvari also does a great job as Angela Chase, such a contrast to her role in _American PIe_. She is many ways a star as well, as her life ends up just being a &#34;commercial&#34; like everyone else.<br /><br />_American Beauty_ is a movie which celebrates being true to oneself. It attacks the alienation we all feel at times, especially the alienation we have from ourselves.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I have bought and used this film multiple times with my Polaroid 420 Land Camera and really like it. However I do recommend you bump the exposure meter a little (on Polaroid Land Cameras it's usually a dial on the front of the camera) helps alot and also try to push back the tension spring (bar thing across the back of the inside of the film compartment) to help prevent the film leader ripping off as these film packs are jjust slightly larger than the originals Polaroid made
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Watch every episode, it is the best!  Just when you think that nothing else can happen, the story thickens!  I love this show and can't wait for the next season.
0439023483|4.0|The book arrived at the expected time and is in almost perfect shape. It only has a page that has a little cut and the cover is a little bent. Besides that it's in really good shape.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is by far one of Ken Folliet's books.  I had to finish it in less than two days!  Now I can't wait to begin the second which I will do now!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would consider this to Friends and FAMILY<br />I rated this 5 star because Its an awesome product<br />I like this game very Much because its like temple run
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a fast paced drama that includes intrigue, relationships, and a sample of how war affects government security and people's lives.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a great read.  I didn't want it to end! Grabbed my interest from page one and held it throughout
B001UTW7QU|5.0|...then this is for you.  Several years ago I caught a few episodes of Fringe and loved it.  However, have never been able to connect with it, since I work nights.  Netflix does not have this in their down-stream availability.  So I was very excited when I saw it offered via Amazon Prime...Yeah!!! Quality on my Kindle Fire HD has been Excellent!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Absolutely brilliant! It's a fun was to act like someone at a barber shop or hair salon! It never seems to get old! Could cost less but still! With it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What a case of overhype!  It is as if it was written by a teenager struggling through English composition.  Predictable from the first chapter.  Erotic?  I don't think so.
B001HN6922|5.0|Another great title from Pixar.  I purchased it for a young relative who loves animated movies and they absolutely loved it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really well done. Great pace and outstanding acting. Definitely deserved the award for the best picture. I would recommend it for all.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Very nice pace to this album sung by a fresh new singer from Scotland by way of Great Britain.  Saw her on the Vanity Fair special on CBS and bought this immediately.  Love the entire album
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This was a great book and has really inspired me.  I returned to running 2 months ago after a 25 year break since highschool cross country.  I read this book in about a week and am fascinated.  I will complete my first 1/2 marathon in a a little over a month and had planned on a marathon in the next year.  This book has really made me wonder what else I can complete.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has many twists and turns and definitely kept me guessing until the very end. I only gave four stars because of the ending, which was a little disappointing.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Extremely well written. Clear concise argument an d outline of education/poverty debate in America. A must read for anyone involved in the educational reform movement.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game for adults and kids.<br />Teaches importance of care and responsibility for animals and pets.  Many options of beautiful horses and tack.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I purchased several of these for co-workers and they all love them.  They are durable and very functional.  Highly recommended.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was full of big fanny wagons<br />Here go go cole is a big deal you are worse than the way
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|This was an unfortunate choice for me, as I do not enjoy this genre. I know there are lots of Dr. Who fans, I just am not one of them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it was so fun playing this game I expetioly love the rope and cart ride tell more on what. you think
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The Lucky One keeps you on a roller coaster ride from happiness to fear to downright anger. Having the courage to get away from an abusive situation is critical.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I usually like Flynn's books, this one was not up to par. I found it boring and slow moving. It seemed to lack the usual flare.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|it is a dumb game, but maybe I don't have the patience.  I don't see what all the hype is about.
B007JMW46U|5.0|A very good collection of Sherlock Holmes stories and even though I am not a much of a person<br />Who  enjoys mystery  stories about murder and crime I loved it......
0307895475|5.0|I got exactly what they advertised, overall it was a great experiance and I would work with them again in the future.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I love this character! Fast moving story with enough twists and turns to keep you guess and great character development
1452101248|5.0|My first cooking god is K Paul from Louisiana.  Every dish he makes has layers of flavor that you can't find anywhere else. He also has layers of fat--sometimes calling for two sticks of butter in a dish. What's not to like?  Yotam Ottolenghi is my new healthy cooking god--because he creates the same splendid food and taste sensations by enhancing the natural flavors in each vegetable--but with none of the bad stuff.  I have now cooked my way through the whole book (and evangelized this tome to everyone I know).  Every single dish is a hit: fascinating and unusual flavors, gorgeous presentation, easy cooking methods.  Dishes like roasted sweet potato slices are so gorgeous they end up as photos on my facebook page.  Even my kids who don't want to eat &#34;vegetarian&#34; love every recipe.  They actually beg me to make the roasted veggies!  What can be better than that?
B00AESN8XY|3.0|weeeee I'm gonna plague the world mom!<br />that's great hon.<br />seriously? whats the point of this game? plague the world? not planning on getting this app
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD gives a good workout if you only have a little bit of time to exercise and can't get out of the house to strength train.  Best part about it - once you know what the moves are (after doing the workouts a few times) you can turn on &#34;music only&#34; so you don't have to hear Jill talk and talk every single time.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A very enjoyable story of the struggle of knowledge and truth against the forces of deception. The world of the silo is intriguing in its limitations. I couldn't put this story down until it was finished.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Watching these back to back was very fun. Trying to figure out who was who and eventually learning the backgrounds as to why they were like they were...brilliant.
B004BSFSTA|5.0|Bought these for my wife a whiles back and she loves them - the occasional times I've used them I find them top quality build and excellent sound / noise cancelling. They're an extremely comfortable headphone with great sound and I have to say, it feels a little nice to have the Marshall logo on them.<br /><br />Top marks, the only issue we have with them is they don't have a microphone (the version with the mic wasn't available when I bought them) - phone music fanatics take note, buy the one with the mic.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I knew the ending but l still cryed.  It was a total inside look at these brave solders. My heart goes out to these families.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased with this novel. It was on  of the best books I have ever read. My heart is touched by the beautiful tale Roberts so eloquently and cleverly put together. The hear  An  love of India is in this book. I only wish there were a thousand more pages to read.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|We haven't played following the instructions, but our 3 year old son who really likes the Angry Birds app, enjoys playing with the pieces and making a tower to knock down with the birds and catapult.  The catapult in this edition was much better than in &#34;On Thin Ice&#34;--not sure if it is just randomly better, or if the catapults of this edition are better.  The pigs are superior to the &#34;On Thin Ice&#34; version, also (similar material to the birds instead of being hard plastic with stickers).
184195392X|5.0|Read it before you see the movie.  Don't give away the ending and as it is said the story will make you believe in God.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Seriously - Ellen knows how to write!  Love It~  everybody would enjoy this book by Ellen!<br />All Should read this !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is awesome and totally fun for all ages. I, love playing subway surfers. I play it 24/7! I love subway surfers. It is the best game ever. It's my favorite game! I hope they make another version. You know like Subway Surfers 2.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is a more fun version of Temple Run. It has bright vibrate colors and new country updates for example from Rio to Rome. It is incredibly addicting I can not stop playing it and I love the cop in the bunny suit. I recommend Subway Surfer to everyone. It I  fun and enjoyable. I love it<3
B001AITGWE|5.0|This movie takes place in the gritty times of LA. Part vigilante,part hero, all heart. There are some WTF moments but other than that its a great movie to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was a page turner - I was always wanting to see what happens next.<br /><br />Hate for the series to end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok it starts out boring and then it is very addicting i would recommend it to everyone it is fun for 10 year olds
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great Sci-Fi book! This is the first book I have read by Hugh Howey. Based on this omnibus edition of &#34;Wool&#34;, I'd say he is one of the best sci-fi authors today. Looking forward to more stories from the Silo.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game i bet nun of you suckers<br />Could beat my score. Not Trying to be mean but well maybe i am:):):)
1616550414|4.0|I would give it 5 stars automatically just because I love everything to do with The Legend of Zelda, but this wasn't what I expected at all.<br /><br />First of all it was much bigger in size than I expected, it's like a coffee table book, rather than a real book. Also hardback.<br /><br />I also, thought this would be a book-book, that I could read, but is instead full of concept art and pictures. Not that that's a bad thing, but I wanted a book that I could actually read about the history of Hyrule.<br /><br />Overall, it is a must have for zelda collectors, but know that it is still somewhat on the shallow surface as far as knowledge of Zelda lore. If you played the games, you probably know most/all of the information in this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really fun! I enjoy it. If you have nothing to do, this game keeps you really occupied!<br />Enjoy!!
B008B9JSD2|5.0|Wonderful movie - charming and sweet.  Numerous funny moments (the conclave voting, the cardinals' volleyball tournament, and the Swiss Guardsman who impersonates the pope.)  But at its core, it is a very moving film.  It's not easy being Pope, that's for sure.
B005IH0MM6|5.0|Very enjoyable.. I would have no problem recommending this book to all my friends . Very well written.<br />I devoured it .
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have all the flip art pic games. Every single game is totally awesome. I highly recommend them. Hours of intense fun!
B00AA7V2Z0|2.0|I find this program a complete waste of time, with no plot or point. So I cannot see why anyone produced it at all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great acting, great plot. Very interesting to watch, and keeps me wanting to watch more. I finished Season 2 in time to watch Season 3 via PBS.org.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|This movie is so emotionally driven and so well acted that I felt like I knew Precious in real life! I can see why it won awards.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing &#34;It's Time&#34; a few times on the radio, seeing Imagine Dragons profiled on BYU TV, and also because it was on sale. I'm glad I did! I really enjoyed several tracks, including &#34;Tiptoe&#34;, &#34;Radioactive&#34;, and &#34;Demons&#34;, but I haven't found myself pressing the skip button at all. Solid album.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|As a huge fan of detective fiction, I always go back to the original.  Many of the dramatized stories do justice to the original work, but to me it's always the most fun to read original stories.  Highly recommend this book.
B003Y2XI8W|3.0|Album starts out strong but gets weak towards end.  Too much high pitched singing without good music to back it up.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Fraction suck to figure I know...this small program really dose what it says and says what it dose...hey what else could you ask for!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Not only is this movie funny,touching and packed with coolness..but also great voice actors/actress'!The whole &#34;monster&#34; thing hasn't been done in along time so it was great to see the real classic monsters come back to kids!The storyline was very good,characters were cool and music n comedy great!just a really good movie,we have now watched it four times,and will buy it soon!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This was a very good read.  It took a while to get into the plot, but then I couldn't put it down.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|We hadn't heard of this movie before, but with Bruce Willis and a semi sci-fi twist, we thought it might be interesting. It was interesting and entertaining, if a bit disutopian. There were also several open paradoxes left around, but that's ok, It's a movie.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|The animals are adorable, the sounds aren't aggravating, and the game itself is rather simple, but very fun. It reminds me of Happy Tree Friends, without the gore...  I love this game!
0345444051|5.0|This novel tells the tale of the last generation of mankind on Earth. All man's development in space and travel are stopped by alien \\"overlords\\" who take over Earth, establishing a benevolent dictatorship which eliminates poverty, ignorance and disease. This golden age ends abruptly as the overlords bend to the will of a superior intelligence which demands Earth's destruction.<br /><br />This may seem like a nerdy book but I read it in school and fell in love. I normally don't like \\"alien\\" books but this one was just so different then the typical scifi books you imagine.<br /><br />Why can't the overlords show themselves when they first come to earth?<br /><br />Well that's the whole point of the book.<br /><br />You have to read this book! It's a classic<br /><br />Read it and tell me what you think! I would love to discuss this book with you!
B008KGPEQG|5.0|He's amazing.  The 3rd person tense threw me a bit, but other than that, I loved it.  I see him in my neighborhood often.
0618680004|2.0|We all know that Richard Dawkins has a special reserved agenda to attack Catholic traditions, in fact any religious tradition, but he goes way to far here. To trust yourself entirely in the hands of man through Science is just as delusional. The answer comes from Sigmund Freud in Chapter 10 of \\"The Future of an Illusion\\", in this last chapter, Freud admits that it is not wise to advocate science as a replacement for religion because science requires intellect to recognize the facts that science offers as to \\"Truth\\". Freud says in effect that it is better to have the illusory framework of religion because man is instinctive rather than intellectual, and it takes many years to form an intellect, but ingrained within man is the instinctual, which is naturally drawn to a higher power.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I thought that only having 6 people to do for hair would be boring but it isn't!! it is super fun and you can create any style
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing app. I play on the xbox and I recently got into the app through a friend. I do think the price is a little high but in the end its worth it! I would recomend this to everyone
B009IF82SK|4.0|This is from Amazon Instant video. I love the service, and that we can watch the season as it unfolds.  Unfortunately, every once in a while the picture quality degrades,resulting in a lot of pixelation.  Audio remains fine.  Since we paid for HD, I'd hoped everything would be csrystal clear.  That said, I'd buy it again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|There are a lot of unanswered questions in this book, which forces the reader to the next book. Great story!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am old enough to have read about all the characters growing up. I feel young again watching it. Good vs. evil. The show is well written, and there is no cursing, blood, or gore. The whole family can watch it together. It's about time! We need more shows like this one.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I mean Really!, how can you go wrong with a Bradley Cooper movie.  This movie was requested as a Christmas gift.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I like the long cord so that I can plug it in across the room and keep reading.  Excellent purchase for an avid reader/gamer.
0307592731|5.0|If you want to be moved, inspired, motivated...this is the book for you. Bought it for a friend as well!
B002RI9UBS|3.0|I found it to be too slow and gave up and watched the movie instead which was great in comparison.
B00A757EFW|4.0|It is just like the orginal game, but very hard to operate. the joy stick doesn't work well, but still enjoyable.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|Everyone else seems to think that this is a good game right? Well I think not. I couldn't even get the darn think to open! Every time I pressed open, it would show a loading sign then send me home! This is a major glitch in the game. Don't take the risk of getting this game, it's not worth the frustration.
B008D36INE|3.0|I usually love Rachel Weisz but it was a little hard to get into her character in this movie - she seemed pathetic and lacking in good judgement. But having not ever seen the play, she's could have been just fine. Who knows. The actor that portrayed her husband, the older judge, did a lovely job. You could feel his desperation trying to get her back. And Freddie Page, bad Freddie Page. Tom Hiddelston did a great job of being a troubled, wounded jackass. But out of the two, he seemed much more realistic than Hester. He conveyed more of his character in less screen time and was able to do it and make people like him.<br /><br />I'd watch it again for Freddie Page and that's about it.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|It was really good, but right when the game was getting interesting they stick you with a buy it option smh! No thanks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is by far one of the best I have ever read. Although I could predict parts of it the relationship between sky an  holder tears at your heart and keeps you wanting more.
031250926X|5.0|My 2 year old son loves this book!  We have read it close to a million times.  We had to replace the book because the spine was broken and the cover fell off, but it was well used when it happened.  :)  Great purchase!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I was intrigued by the concept of alternate day fasting. There seem to be many health benefits as well as a chance to lose weight. The concept is pretty simple and it is not doing without on fast days. They have some great meal ideas and this sounds like something that could be easily incorporated into my life. I really enjoy food, so the concept of having a 500 hundred calorie day of healthy foods followed by several days of eating what I want is appealing. I am tired of trying to count calories or points every day. This seems like you can get into the routine of these fast days and have a variety of different meals that fit into this calorie count and only have to strictly pay attention on the two fast days. I realize it wouldn't be wise to gorge on the other days, but I think eating reasonably and incorporating this 5:2 system of ADF would work.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I bought this movie along with the Trilogy 1-3 . For an after surgery recovery selection .  Very good movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game with a lot of unlockable items and I just lose myself while playing this game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|But I was a bit dissapointed about the ending, wish there would be more about how Panem was after it &#34;got quiet&#34;..

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I am very pleased. it does as it says. the only problem is the loading. it takes forever to load. but other than that it is a good app.
B0000261RJ|3.0|I really enjoyed this album when it first came out in 1985 but over repeated listens this doesn't hold up like Holy Diver and The Last in Line or as well as Ronnie James Dio's work with Black Sabbath or Rainbow. What is ironic is that Dio left Rainbow in the late-70's because Ritchie Blackmore wanted to go in a more commercial direction, which is exactly what Dio did on Sacred Heart. The opening track, \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" was the now typical fast rocking opener that opened all of his albums as well as with Sabbath. However, this is kind of generic when compared to  \\"Neon Knights\\" or \\"Stand Up and Shout\\". The title track is much better (Dio's title tracks were usually very good) and \\"Another Lie\\" is also very good. \\"Rock and Roll Children\\" and \\"Hungry for Heaven\\" saw Dio really reaching for the mainstream with the keyboards given more weight over Vivian Campbell's guitars. Of the two, \\"Rock and Roll Children\\" is the stronger track. After this, the album slowly but surely runs out of steam as \\"Like the Beat of a Heart\\" sounds like a weaker rewrite of Holy Diver's \\"Straight Through The Heart\\" and the remaining tracks are unmemorable, especially \\"Shoot Shoot\\". All told, there are a couple strong tunes on Sacred Heart but Dio would make better albums after this even if they didn't sell as much.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Brings up the age-old problem of communicating with teenagers...how do parents really know what they're thinking if they won't talk to you.....and even if they do talk, are they telling you what they really feel?<br />This story keeps you guessing, right up until the end.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Having watched the first two seasons of this show on HBO, I could not wait to find out more. The books are awesome!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|At first glance, Downton Abbey seems like one of those Masterpiece Theater shows that your parents watched when you were younger. Now, I AM my parents. This show is amazing, the characters are enjoyable to watch and you're always wondering what's happening next and how it's going to happen. There are few &#34;unlikable&#34; characters and even the flawed ones are entertaining and unpredictable. It's a great show and if you haven't tried it, give it a chance.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. I love that you don't have to wait for hours for your lives to come back or be restored. You're lives are limitless.

1250012570|5.0|Hello folks, just letting you know that THIS book is one heck of a love story. I was really looking forward to this release. I enjoyed Rowell's writing in her previous book Attachments, but I didn't care for the story. Eleanor & Park struck a chord with me instantly. I don't know if I remember ever reading a book that made me equal parts heartbroken and giddy at the same time. It seems an impossible balance to maintain, but Rowell does a wonderful job of it. I also loved that it takes place in the 80's. It never mentions the year in the book, but you just know it is the 80's because of the appearance of tapes, acid washed jean jackets, and feathered bangs. I loved how there was no technology references like texting, facebook, or email to distract me. It also switches POV while using third person, which you would think wouldn't work, but it totally does. Anyway, loved it.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|I didn't expect that I would enjoy this but I did. The humor takes a light look at the social interactions between the clicks.
B002C6A6N6|3.0|The discs are still messed up but we can watch them on a computer or ps3. We got a different box set to try and fix the problem but we still can't watch all the episodes properly. It's what I ordered but it was kind of disappointing to have an order from amazon go wrong when I've never had problems before.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you haven't read this book, you must.  Narrarated by two characters makes the book very cool.  It is interesting to see the two sides to the story.  Gillian uses such great attention to small details and brings them back later on.  She's the best author I know.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|Film that's impossible to reveal spoilers because there aren't any.  We cannot say the nun principal is in every way evil because she is privy to a long period of observation that we viewers are not.  Likewise, the priest is at minimum guilty of burying the most serious offense an altar boy can commit.  I'm going to take a very unusual stance and say that at no time was sexual contact implied.  This was 1964, when merely allowing a student to go unpunished was a career destroying scandal.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|absolutely fantastic set of films, even the third one. if you can power through these three films back to back to back my hats off to you. fantastic series.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|If you liked Despicable Me, you'll Love this. It's so very adorable in every way. Don't miss out on this!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn must be a scary person.  Some parts of this book were really twisted and sick.  However, Gillian's attention to detail is amazing.  Pay attention because things that seem like small details come back around later on.  An unpredictable read.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|I thought this was a great movie for kids and adults. It had a great message about accepting all types of people. My daughter loved the music and the jokes. The annimation was also great.
B001DCZ4IW|4.0|This is a delightful classic about a suicidal teenager who falls in love with an old woman, and learns from her the joys and meaning of life.  The audio is a bit difficult to comprehend.

B00633W614|4.0|This was a great read.  I truly could not put this book down.  I was disappointed in the end because there was no end.  I guess we will never know which son WON!  It was still very interesting, and I recommend this book to any one who loves a good mystery.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|It is great that Amazon provides a place to buy books to read on a Kindle. . . .thank you.
0691152640|4.0|This book should dispel the myth that government debt is safe. Covers crisis event's from eight centuries to the 2008 down turn. This is not a narrative story. So if your wanting a good story on financial folly you better look for another book. The data in this book shows that crisis is like earthquakes and they are of various magnitudes, have tendency to cluster. The last chapter promotes the idea that there should be a international body that regulates the global markets. I strongly disagree with the authors on this. The book is a good data source, but you can skip the last chapter.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The 3D aspect of this film was better than expected, picture and audio quality great, and the movie itself was great too!
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|I liked idea and execution of this game immensely. If the content itself were a little more dynamic and less repetitive I'd have given it 5 stars, but it's still a pretty cool game.

B009K72EP8|5.0|I can remember seeing the announcement trailer for the clone wars way back before anyone knew anything about what we were about to experience.  I can remember pretty vividly sitting at the theaters watching Star Wars The Clone Wars with my friends, and I have absolutely enjoyed each season after that theatrical experience.  Now here we are 5 seasons later, each season has been amazing, and season after season they somehow manage to keep getting better and better.  I am writing this review after having now seen the entire 5th season and I must say that it has not only been better than the last 4 seasons, but it has managed to take the series to a whole new level.<br /><br />The show this season has been heavily based on continuing the story, and not only that but it has started to end characters and their part in the Clone Wars.  This season has been all about story arcs and taking the show to the next level in the Clone Wars.  As the season comes to a close you can really see it leading up to Episode III, you can see everything start to unfold, and what does that mean for our favorite characters like Ahsoka?  Well with out spoiling anything by the end of the finale you will know how it all comes together.  This season has had 2 of my favorite episodes, they were made with amazing quality, myself and my friends sat in astonishment at some of the events that unfolded, and by the end of the finale I had tears starting to swell in my eyes which is something that rarely happens in an episode of the Clone Wars.<br /><br />The journey has started to come to it's end, and with the way this season ended it could have very well been the last, but we know there is more to come.  I couldn't help but reflect on the events that have happened and the adventures that the characters have all gone through starting with the movie.  The Grand Army of the Republic finally bears a resemblance to the evil empire we know it will soon become, the show has fleshed out the events prior to Episode IV better than the prequel trilogy did in many respects, you walk away from the end of this thinking to yourself \\"it all makes sense now, I know why Anakin did what he did\\".<br /><br />I really reflected on the events of the movie when Anakin meets Asoka for the first time, and as the two of them walk away together Obi-Wan says \\"Let's just hope Anakin is ready for this responsibility.\\"  And Yoda replies saying \\"Ready he is, to teach an apprentice. To let go of his pupil, a greater challenge it will be.\\"  Now here at the end of season 5 we now see this unfold, what a great series this has been, what a great season, and what a great finale.  It ended unlike any episode prior, I get the same tears in my eyes thinking about the final moment, and then the screen fading to black, and the credits coming for the first time in silence...<br /><br />May the force be with you, always...<br /><br />-Ashsode IV better than the prequel trilogy did in many respects, you walk away from the end of this thinking to yourself \\"it all makes sense now, I know why Anakin did what he did\\".<br /><br />I really reflected on the events of the movie when Anakin meets Asoka for the first time, and as the two of them walk away together Obi-Wan says \\"Let's just hope Anakin is ready for this responsibility.\\"  And Yoda replies saying \\"Ready he is, to teach an apprentice.

0345803485|2.0|Dumbest book I ever read.  This author really scammed the public with all the hipe and made a ton of money doing it.
B005EWDA9M|2.0|I have every translated Murakami novel on my shelf and love them all. Here, though, I must be missing something. The raunchy bits are quite banal, the heroine is a cliché on heels and I can't for the life of me understand the endless recaps. Even so, this was a best-seller in Japan, South Korea and many other countries.<br />So it must be me. But I don't feel like buying part three.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game came on my computer. I had to go downstairs to play. Now I can play ANYWHERE! I don't always win but it's still great to play.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had never played this game before getting a tablet but it's really fun! It might be easier on a smartphone to tilt and junk, but that's okay.
B007P7UF0G|2.0|The picture is tiny.  I only have a 32&#34; TV but the movie is so small I can barely see it.<br />I saw this movie on TV recently and it was normal size.  The movie you sent was disappointing.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|Overall, I like it....it is lovely and so relaxing. I think it is good to have among your music collection and comes handy when you feel like listening to soft and romantic music.
1616550414|5.0|If you've played one game as a kid or played everything in the series you will love this book not only for the content but the quality of the book itself. Couldn't believe how heavy the hardcover was and the thickness/beautiful color of the pages.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Sometimes it didn't tell me my matches were ready. Other than that, I like playing on the bigger screen. Too bad nobody plays Draw Something anymore.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Do you want to protect and showcase the beauty of iPhone? If yes, then this is the product for you.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|What happened to the price of the e-books??  When I first purchased mu kindle the book prices were very reasonable, now they are borderline outrageous.  Do the publishers realize that there is almost no cost to an e-book, when compared to actually printing a paper copy.  I actually found a book on Amazon that was cheaper in the paper format vs an electronic copy.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Couldn't understand what they were saying.  Some of the English movies are like that for me.  I do enjoy watching English Movies, especially the Series.  Their stories are more of my era.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This photo editor works really well! Too bad the Kindle Fire doesn't have a native photo editing app OR just, like, a webcam app. Sheesh.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is my favorite app to keep track of notes in an ordlerly format.  I love the ability to put a catagory on each notebook and not have to wonder where I noted things.  As a wife, mother, caregiver, and writer this app is a time saver.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Ok, I am addicted to this movie. I love the chemistry - but sound affects are awesome too. Thumbs up!!!
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Every movie that I've ever watched with Morgan Freeman is always good.  He's a very good actor and his movies have a good Story.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I really hate that I have to change it from &#34;Top Stories&#34; to &#34;Most Recent&#34; every single time but other than that it works pretty well.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|Would recommend this book. Life is what you make it.  Live and love everyday. The book kept my interest. Excellent
B009GEFXLC|5.0|So glad writers are keeping the fun, the mystery and the &#34;teams&#34; all true to the growth  we have all seen.  Still a show to anticipate every week.  Bronson played his part perfectly, hope they bring him back.
B001QJUX24|4.0|I liked the fact it showed the truth about how it was for the people that made that trip.  It was hard to understand what they were saying though.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Perfect condition and a great addition to our movie collection. Avatar was a favorite movie of ours and I am glad to have finally bought it for an affordabe price!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I had to read this book in high school and loved it, it's nice reading it again as an adult.
1423151054|5.0|Hi -- Haven't bought it yet, but definitely will, but must correct the copy.<br /><br />I'm a former Disney artist and animation history teacher. These were NOT Walt's original animators. His original animators worked with him on the &#34;Alice&#34;  and &#34;Oswald&#34; series, and among them were Rudy Ising, Hugh Harmon, Friz Freleng, and Ub Iwerks (the only one who stuck around for Mickey after Universal took Oswald and the other animators away.) Grim Natwick was also there prior to the &#34;nine old men.&#34;<br /><br />The Nine Old Men came along in the thirties when the studio started to get famous because of Mickey, and weren't named that till after the strike of '41. Art Babbitt and Fred Moore influenced these guys, but Art didn't get along with Walt and Fred died relatively young in a car accident. Not to take anything away from these guys -- they made their own innovations and raised the bar considerably!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|It was Totally the ending I thought it would be.... my heart pounded throughout most of the book, only to have an ending that broke my heart but also gave me  hope

B006H5120E|5.0|I am just writing the review for the Blu-ray 3D and Blu-ray version as the movie doesn't require any review since everybody knows about it. The Blu-ray 3D was not that great to me compared to other original 3D movies because the 3D effects didn't look so effective. Lots of scenes are just looking as if it is in normal picture. Even some of the most important and prime scenes still looks normal which was actually supposed to be coming very close to the audience to get that 3D effect.<br />The Blu-ray version is very good, the colors are so vivid and it really looks High Definition. Both the 3D and Blu-ray versions, has superb digital audio surround sound(I have a Bose Home Theater system and it was a GREAT experience).<br />Overall i am giving 4 stars because the movie is 100% worth buying and a must have in your movie collection, the reason why i didn't give  5 stars is because i was not so impressed with the 3D version.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves this app, but I would suggest using parental controls. It would seem very easy to order things/buy new things with this app, if it wasn't controlled.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I hadn't seen any of these movies in the theater but my husband and I really enjoyed watching them for the first time at home.  We will definitely watch them again..
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read &#34;House of Hades&#34;. Only four stars because I wish there were more Jason and Frank chapters. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes Greek and/or Roman mythology. I know I love it and I hope you loved it too.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|With over 500 reviews with mostly five stars, there's not much I can add.  I've had the knife for six month, field tested it, absolutely no complaints.  Great knife, great sheath. I would purchase again in a blink of an eye.   Edit:  Update.  Not as good as I originally thought.  Several points have revealed themselves that I need to vent about.  #1 the handle came apart.  Two of the bolts completely came off during batoning.  I had not used the BK2 for aggressive batoning before so I have to admit that my original review did not take that into considertaion.  I think it's unacceptable that a survival knife's  handle can so easily just fall apart with use.  What if this happened in real survival situation where I depended on batoning for making fire or building shelter.  Completely puts me off.  And, I don't want to hear about putting &#34;locktite&#34; on it.  Why should I have to do that?  I paid a decent amount of money and should not have to worry about that.  But, yes, I did eventually have to purchase new bolts from a hardware store and put locktite.    #2:  The screws and fasteners that hold the sheath together are falling out.  Are you kidding me?    #3:  Edge retention is poor on this knife.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  Is it because of the quality of the steel and heat treatment?  Or is it because the sheath dulls the knife, as I'm reading now.  Nevertheless, this is a problem and again, leaves me very dissappointed.    I own lots of knives, Ontario, Tops, Essee, other Kabars, customs...                   I would have liked to recommend this knife because it looks and feels so indestructable, but, what I mentioned above is a deal breaker for me and could not justify paying the price for it when there are so many other options availabe.  I still use the knife now, but, I don't really trust it.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I wish this series was free with my prime membership. I would like to watch all seasons of castle but I can't afford it.
1401216676|5.0|This is a cool series. I was always a Batman and Joker fan. This is a really cool book, for all Batman fans.
B00866H7SS|5.0|I really love this series, despite myself. It should be a guilty pleasure, but some of the 'effed up-ness of these characters reasonates with me in a way I have trouble describing. Both Eva and Gideon aren't exactly the most realistic characters around (and why does one of the characters always have to be really stinking rich in these things?), but their chemistry and the way they heal each other is quite addictive. The sex scenes are graphically described, so if that's not your thing, stay away. But for romance novel fans (of which I guess I am, even though the Mills & Boon set has never really appealed to me), this is definitely one of the better series', set in contemporary culture and featuring some great additional characters too. And hey, at least it's not set on a pirate ship or something ridiculous.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great odd characters that add up to a fun mix.<br />Entertaining and always moving. Dull moments hard to find in a Wes Anderson movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Absolutely love this game!! It gets more challenging as You go and definitely keeps you busy! It feels as if you really own a horse!
140120841X|5.0|I love V for Vendetta. It was a classic story line. I think everyone should read it sometime in their life.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Excellent, original and smart. It defies genre really, and is telling of a realistic future. It's got elements of Blade Runner and even Gattaca in it, and the 80s references will please anyone who grew up in or lived through that period. A really great read - highly recommended.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this set as a gift for my son, he states he's really happy with what he's read so far.  He's just upset that the next book in the series won't be available until October, but he's anxiously awaiting for it's arrival.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfures is a fun game that keeps your blood pumping. It keeps you on your toes I love this game but if your looking for an easier game download temple run 2.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|loved every word on every song! great music for everyone! this music realky hits close to home, and makes you want to listen over and over again!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|The second in this powerful and addictive series. Realistic? Well, probably not. But I'm pretty certain folks don't read these sorts of things for much realism. And Giddeon & Eva's relationship is just too hypnotic to ignore. Not for the faint of heart, but a bit of good, sexy fun.<br /><br />That said, these books do contain a bit of material that'll be a trigger for sexual abuse victims, so beware.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I like movies based on true stories.The story was well told and moved along so it kept you interested, you also learn some true facts about our history with Iran most people forgot or didn't know. Good Movie well worth the.<br /> $3.99 we spent.
0545265355|5.0|It's the kind of book that make you keep reading, makes you ignore tests and going out or even living, so be careful, only start reading if you are up for consequences! ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!

0061339202|3.0|Flow is a concept defined as \\"the optimal state of inner experience [is one] in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy--or attention--is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else. These periods of struggling to overcome challenges are what people find to be the most enjoyable times of their lives.\\"<br /><br /> The book makes two points, and then hammers them home over 300 pages of specifics regarding appreciating food, friends, art, sports, etc. First, finding a skill to become expert at makes you more appreciative of what is involved in the making of every skill, and brings with it greater responsibility and awareness in the world. \\"This paradox of rising expectations suggests that improving the quality of life might be an insurmountable task. In fact, there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment.\\"<br /><br /> Second, that socialization and conforming creates communities that are resistant to growth and only through developing expertise and appreciation of expertise can we overcome this. \\"Routinization, unfortunately, tends to take place very rapidly. Freud was still alive when his quest for liberating the ego from its oppressors was turned into a staid ideology and a rigidly regulated profession. Marx was even less fortunate: his attempts to free consciousness from the tyranny of economic exploitation were soon turned into a system of repression that would have boggled the poor founder's mind. And as Dostoevsky among many others observed, if Christ had returned to preach his message of liberation in the Middle Ages, he would have been crucified again and again by the leaders of that very church whose worldly power was built on his name.\\"<br /><br /> Find your skill, develop it, learn the difficulties involved in developing expertise, and appreciate others expertise. As in many other scientific self-help and positive psychology books, the core personality trait to develop is gratitude. Be gracious of your opportunities, the good moments in life, and constantly seek to learn and grow from them.<br /><br />  If this is your first book on positive psychology, you will enjoy the easy read and extended application to a variety of fields. Otherwise, the book is unnecessarily long and repetitive, using a smattering of studies to indulge in a philosophy on enjoying life.ion in the Middle Ages, he would have been crucified again and again by the leaders of that very church whose worldly power was built on his name.\\"<br /><br /> Find your skill, develop it, learn the difficulties involved in developing expertise, and appreciate others expertise.

B00BHMETKC|3.0|Lots of hype and we found it interesting but just OK - not as 'action packed' as we would have expected
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|The silence and awkwardness of every scene is enough to throw ur television out ur window or fall into a very deep sleep. I understand the overall point of the movie (he's crazy and unwell) and the last 30 min are good but it does not overcome how bad the 1st hour was... it was Holy$&!# AWFUL!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well what can I say it got challenging as time went on. But it was fun not only for me but for my younger siblings too!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Everything about this show is amazing, except for how long it was on TV; 11 episodes was not nearly long enough. Thankfully, the DVD has all 14 of the episodes made.  Firefly has a great mix of humor and drama and the casting and acting is superb.  It would have been nice if this show had been on longer so more of each character's backstory could have been shown.  I would have given it 6 stars but it only went to 5.  FOX didn't know a good thing when it had it on TV.
B005USZYDU|5.0|It's the most exhilarating and exciting book of it's series,and I like  it more than all the others in the series.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free operates on the principle that less is more. The presentation is very simple, featuring plain graphics, minimal sound, and gameplay that is anything but complex. Of course, this means the relies entirely on the quality of said gameplay to win over the crowd. How well does it work?<br /><br />Pretty well, truth be told. The idea is that there are colored dots on a grid, two of each color, and you must draw lines connecting each pair. The catch is that the lines must not cross over each other, and therein lies the challenge. It's not exactly deep, and experienced puzzle gamers will likely breeze right through the hundreds of boards included.<br /><br />But hey, it's a fun game, and it's free to boot. You've got nothing to lose by giving it a shot, and it's pick-up-and-play nature makes it a great app for whirling away the time. Besides, if you want an involving experience, you probably shouldn't be playing mobile games.

B0091REZMW|4.0|great game with great graphics.  addictive.  playing nonstop.  do wish it was a little easier to earn diamonds instead of having to purchase them.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|captivating from the minute it starts.  one of the best of the potter series.  wish it was longer.  awesome graphics.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was excellent!! So much better than the movie. I would most assuredly recommend this book to anyone who is interested!
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I guess I should have expected a story about young cancer patients to be depressing, but this was such a downer.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This game is pretty cool ,but I don't like being nagged for a review or it having be a curtain length. When I really din't like doing this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is another game my sister-in-law got me hooked on. It really makes you pay close attention to the board.With a drop of a dime it changes.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|By Season 3 the characters are very developed. There are a lot of great twists and turns as several stories spiral into interesting situations.
0143035711|5.0|I have just started this book, it is well written and quite good on portraying the life of a chopper pilot.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|I haven't finished this book yet.  I like DeMille but this is not his best.  However,  is a good book and I would recommend it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I loved the show LOST by ABC. When it ended I needed something else to watch and this show is almost just as good but still amazing with a good story and great actors. 5 stars!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i love this alarm.....it wakes me up every day i definitly recommend this app....<br /><br />i love it love love love love it..
1554072840|5.0|The book is to the point and accurate about little girl anatomy I didn't expect that ha! But my daughter enjoyed the book because the little looked like her and she was encouraged to go to the potty more.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This moving was put together very well. It kept the audience engaged, but it didn't jump around too much so I was able to follow along. Really showed how blessed we are to live in America.
B00505QAUY|5.0|I admit I had to summon up the courage to watch this; I'd had it to review for some time, knew what to expect and wanted to able to engage with it fully.<br />It is an unflinching, uncompromising piece of film-making; pitch-black in tone, it's angry, violent and deeply disturbing - but also quite moving. What is most uncomfortable about a film like this is that we all know that for some, aspects of what we are watching is someone's reality. As a study of urban alienation it is all too believable. Joseph is a complex, car-crash of a man, brilliantly characterised by Peter Mullan who slowly develops a relationship with the abused charity shop worker Hannah, played with subtle vulnerability by Olivia Coleman; they are ably supported by an excellent cast and Considine`s writing and direction never misses a beat - this is an amazing debut with that fact in mind.<br />This is a raw, difficult thing to watch - I can`t imagine anyone viewing it for pleasure or entertainment - but it is a haunting, memorable and thought provoking work. A social drama that seems to have no clear message, but leaves the viewer with a window into facets of humanity we perhaps rarely have to consider; both characters have to struggle with almost unendurable circumstances; there is a kind of resolution attained, but not without consequences.<br />A highly recommendable film, but be prepared for it's very dark issues.
B008Q08EG8|4.0|I would have given this movie a higher rating if it had been in color.  Far better than average John Wayne movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Fine acting.  Denzel gives another superb performance. Action is intense during the early stages of the film. The story line then takes the viewer on a journey.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|The book is written very well. Very easy to relate to. The only negative I have found so far is how often she mentions being environmentally conscious. But that is just my opinion. Otherwise, she has some great pointers and advice.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|This is a movie in the ilk of Blindside.  Just as Sandra Bullock carried the move in Blindside, Samuel Jackson carried Coach Carter.  He seemed very believable.
1577314808|5.0|This book is kind of like Buddhism distilled for the Western mind. It's a very inspired, helpful book. It's perfect for people who think too much and drive themselves crazy.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|&#34;WOW&#34; just about sums it up.  How to you rate perfection?  The acting, the costumes, the scenes, the shear perfection of the tale takes you back in time to view their lives as an intimate friend.  I was disappointed in only one thing....it ended before I was ready to say goodbye.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I do enjoy some UK movies and shows, so I tried this show not knowing anything about it.  I was immediately was interested, it is dramatic and the costumes were fantastic!  I am catching up on the series so I can continue on TV.  Definitely worth giving it a try - you'll probably get hooked too!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I expected a novice, and his own words, but wish he'd had some professional advice.  I hoped I would get some perspective on those who give so much for our freedom.  This was shallow and not.informative.
0385343248|5.0|Couldn't find the copy I purchased and enjoyed years ago.  Have read it many times in the past, even read it aloud to the wife prior to the television production that was made at that time.  Took me a long time to get over the poor choice made for the lead role in the story!<br />Rereading this amazing tale was as enjoyable as the first time.  Couldn't put it down this time, either.
B001CXWWBE|5.0|I purchased this Intel gigabit ethernet adapter because my motherboard's built-in Realtek adapter does not work consistently with Linux. I can't believe I did not try this sooner. After disabling the onboard NIC in the BIOS and inserting this card, I booted my computer and this card was immediately recognized by Linux. It works with Linux Mint / Ubuntu / XBMCbuntu and the speed is incredible! Previously, even when the Realtek NIC did work, I struggled with video buffering constantly. Now, with this Intel ethernet card installed, HD video streams flawlessly and with zero compatibility headaches.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun and entertaining game. It is very addictive and creative. Every run is different and unique. I really enjoy the world tour stops.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Bought it with the thoughts of maybe someday I'll need it.<br />Using it more than ever. Fun to use.<br />Great item.
B002RVCD6O|3.0|harry potter is a great series that i love with all my heart. but these movies aren't doing it justice. every time i watch this movie i cringe the majority of the most magical elements have been left out. no longer do you see ghosts floating the halls and never have we even been subject to peeves the poltergeists annoying antics. two hours is jut not enough time to fit it all in. this is why i hold the belief that harry potter should be made into a tv show where the books can be played out in all their marvelous glory.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This is a total must have! It was really nice to have it shipped right to my front door two days BEFORE the estimated arrival time!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|We all love to play these games. If one of us can't get the job done one of the other of us can.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Great challenge! Didn't think it would be so much fun. Can't seem to put it down.<br />Will recommended to others.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though we knew the outcome, we were still on the edge of our seats the entire movie. Nice work Ben Affleck!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love to play this game but I loose more coins than I can afford. It is a really neat game.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love watching programs such as Downton Abbey.  I do beleive dwonton Abbey is among my top two or three that I have have watched.  Love the characters  and love the program.  Sound and picture quality great.  Certainly worth the amount that I paid for it.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love playing this game. I don't stop untill I get all 3 stars. It is one of my most favorite games.
0670023329|5.0|This should be required reading for all high school age young people. The current generation is so far removed from the horrors of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes that those tragedies seem to be ancient  history. The torture and slaughter in North Korea are happening every day and as hard as it is to imagine, probably exceed, in numbers, any human extermination in history.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|As an adult I felt a little shy about watching the newest princess movie. But, I loved it. I have to say how great it was to see a main character focused on finding herself, not just falling in love.  The character only wanted to grow and be herself. Really great movie for young girls.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Good acting, raw realism!  Interesting behind the lines look into Jews during World War 2.  Would highly recommend to others.

B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best TV horror series in existence! More, more more...Please, make more of this caliber. PS: I have to admit I'm glad they killed off Laurie and Shane. Bad role models in my opinion; Laurie was too skinny in a way that was annoying, even though I guess they were all malnourished. Shane on the hand was just an **&^*!!^**. Sorry to say this.
B001NLKT60|4.0|I liked it but it was not as we'll written as the first. Sequels have a lot to live up to, and this book fell down.  I'm looking forward to reading the last installment.  Maybe it will bring it all together.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Add up gems and money fast. fun to play the different games with each pony.  Not complicatednor annoying wanting you to buy crap all the time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was as good as the first .it had  a good ending.happy I got read it for free. Enjoy it
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Don't watch the movie first! Yann Martel's writing is beautiful and captivating, and the story he tells is phenomenal. I can't imagine ANYONE would be disappointed after reading Life of Pi.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Much better than dragonstory where everything becomes to expensive. this one has little games to play inside it. You accumulate money and gems quickly and get more than 100 coins per dragon when you sell them. breed a a lot of cool dragons

B007TXN4TK|2.0|I wish there were more easier songs, though it will be fun for older students and their teachers to try.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Great story, skillfully written, don't miss it. This one went under the radar because there are no car chases or gun fights, it is very enjoyable.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Best pArt about these books is that the storyline is unpredictable. HBO has also done a Mini-Series that is high quality and follows the books pretty close (3rd season/book airing March of 2013).

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not only did I read this trilogy two times in a row, it is the only series I have read twice.<br /><br />Updated *12/30/13*<br /><br />*Slight Spoilers below*<br /><br />I've read this book several times since! I love it, it is my favorite series and I cant get enough. It often leaves me with a \\"book hangover\\"<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen really goes through a lot. She goes through two \\"Hunger Games\\" and a rebellion/war. You really go through her emotional duress and how it has changed her and her family. She is really a girl who was looking out for herself and her family and got thrown into being the face of a rebellion before she even knew anything about it. This trilogy really makes you think of everything from social class issues to war, corrupt government, growing up in hard times, and emotional recovery from those hard times, and yes a \\"love triangle\\". I dont want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that.
B00772M1F6|5.0|JD McPherson blows the doors off with this masterpiece.Wow!Never heard of this guy before,was shipped it on accident and could not believe when I listened to it.The best thing I've heard in the past 10 or 15 years.Sounds like a stack of hot 45's playing at a wild party in the early 60's.Retro yes,but completely authentic and really damn good.Every single song on this album is a standout stand alone bonafide hit that would stand up against the best from back in the day.If you love that period in music you will love love love this.Way to go man!So looking forward to your next effort.
1609611543|5.0|Having hit my 40s, and with my father, assorted uncles and other male relatives all getting heart bypasses or stents, I decided about a year ago that I needed to start taking my overall eating habits more seriously.  Thankfully, I have always been healthy, and do not mind exercising as a rule.  However, over the past several years my weight had started creeping up and it seemed that no matter how much I exercised or stuck to the generally recommended low fat diet with \\"lots of healthy whole grains,\\" I couldn't seem to reach my target weight of 190 (I'm pretty muscular).  I could lose a few pounds here or there if I was really strict, but it was unsustainable and didn't seem to make much difference.<br /><br />I got married last spring to a wonderful woman who happens to be a Type 1 diabetic.  As a result, I have become more aware of blood sugar and the slew of health implications at high levels, so I bought myself a meter and \\"borrowed\\" a few of my wife's test strips so I could start checking my own blood glucose levels.  I was horrified to discover that my fasting blood sugar was consistently in the 116-120 range, which is not too far below the generally accepted full blown diabetic level of 126.  I knew something had to be done.  I am not a person who likes to take medications, so rather than run straight to my doctor, I decided to look into what other options could be explored.  I ramped up the exercise during this process and started to eat more veggies, etc., but continued to have my \\"healthy\\" steel cut oats or bran muffin for breakfast, along with sandwiches with whole wheat or multigrain bread for lunch and whole wheat rolls or something similiar with dinner.  After about three months of this, my blood sugar hadn't budged.  I was getting pretty disheartened, and was basically resigned to having to go see my doctor, who would probably prescribe Metformin or something worse.  Then I discovered this book, \\"Wheat Belly.\\"<br /><br />Having read nothing but the back cover, I told my wife I was going to try going off wheat completely for a couple of weeks just to see what would happen.  The results kicked in before I even finished the book.  In the first five days I dropped three pounds without doing anything else.  More importantly, my fasting blood sugar on the fifth day measured 96 (within normal range) for the first time EVER since I had been testing it.  I've been wheat free (and have avoided other grains as well) for the past nine days.  I've lost an additional two pounds, and my fasting blood sugar continues to be in the 96-103 range.  I imagine that will improve even more as the fat continues to evaporate from around my midsection, and I am stunned at the results.  I'm never hungry. I don't count calories.  We've been socializing a lot this past week, so I've been drinking much more red wine than is medically advised, and I haven't hit the treadmill in several days.  It doesn't seem to matter.  All I did was cut out the wheat and grains.  My pants are getting baggy, my love handles and gut are disappearing, and I feel 1,000 times better, with much more mental focus.  I do miss my morning muffin, but when you realize that it's a health destroyer it makes it a lot easier to pass it up.  And the almost instantaneous results of giving up the wheat speak for themselves.  If you're looking for a natural way to improve your health, I would highly recommend giving this book a read.  I honestly think it has provided me with the information I was lacking and desperately needed to avoid Type II diabetes.k cover, I told my wife I was going to try going off wheat completely for a couple of weeks just to see what would happen.

0988262592|5.0|The Goal is one of my favorite books and this book is unabashedly modeled after it.  However, in The Goal, I had to work to equate the processes in that book to my IT processes.  The Phoenix Project makes that leap for the reader.  I find myself relating to the characters in The Phoenix Project and as others have commented - I've probably met most of them over the course of my career.  More importantly, beneath the fiction are some practical ideas for making IT more effective, efficient and an enabler of critical business services.  Great read!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book. Not quite what I expected (in a good way). Wanted more story in the end. Thank you for a good story!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Watch all other 3d movies BEFORE you watch this.  This movie will ruin all other 3d movies.  It's an amazing Journey of emotions with some amazing visuals.  This is a perfect movie.  I loved it.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Started to develop more skill after several rounds. Fun to watch the coins fall and earn the ability to shake the coins loose. Only wish you could earn more points quicker, rather than having to actually 'purchase' them. You get 40 points to start with and once you burn thru those you are done unless your purchase them or shut down for 9 minutes and start over. Don't understand the bonus rounds and no explanation on how they work; maybe you have to be online to actually make them work? Graphics are really nice. Works better on my Curtis tablet and ok on my Pandigital tablet.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|This case is attractive, simple, and useful. My Kindle slid off the bed a couple of times and the corner of the case hit the floor softening the blowfor my Kindle. And the case is versatile in several positions. Closed, it will travel well.<br /><br />Though it stays in most every position, it slips when I try to use it in a near-flat position, so I sometimes have to set the angle a little higher than I would like so it will stay.

B000TXIKUU|5.0|The Complete Works of Shakespeare illustrated by Rockwell Kent is lavish, well annotated and excellent for Shakespeare experts and novices alike.
0545265355|4.0|These are excellent books! The story is engaging and the complex characters keep you on the edge if your seat. The hard covers are beautiful and definitely worth the extra dollars. These books are high quality from the inside out and definitely worth a read!
B006VREHRS|4.0|A very high quality production,however I would have enjoyed it more it there some characters I cared about! I enjoyed &#34;Luck&#34; more as it's characters were more endearing .
B005DNBDXM|4.0|Interesting story... a huge asteroid is discovered. Interesting theory... it's going to hit Earth -- an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event) -- What to do. How do you keep it secret? Then how do you tell the people that they are most likely going to die?  Feel good ending. Too bad life isn't this nice.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Best book ever so awesome never read a better series I can't get enough can't stop reading all chapters but a little to much romance
0307352145|3.0|I am most definitely an introvert--most social interactions require a great deal of mental prep-work for me to get to, and an even longer recovery time. Most of my friends and family are introverts as well. So this book should've been quite engaging for me. And while it had its moments and is definitely worth the read, I found the tone to be almost too rah-rah introverts (and on the same hand, boo extroverts). There was so much emphasis on the good parts of introversion and little on the drawbacks. Also, the author seems to assume all introverts are shy, which they are not. It may seem like a subtle distinction but it is quite significant (as someone who used to be shy, I know there is a genuine difference inside, even if on the outside no one can tell).<br /><br />While she does cover raising an introverted child, one topic I would've loved for the book to cover was how introverts can relate to their extroverted children. I know several introvert parents with extrovert children, and it's very tough for them to communicate and understand each other.<br /><br />I feel like the people who would most benefit from this book are extroverts with little understanding of introverts, but sadly, they are not the type of people likely to read this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like this game. The ads can get tiring but are not too bad. Fun to use when need to fill a few minutes.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|didn't really need it and it locked up my Kindle for the first time ever.  Will likley ditch this app, for sure I won't use it after the major 'lock up'
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very nice movie. Full of drama and suspense and more drama. I  Would watch it again. Ben Affleck did a great job as the director.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have several friends who have gone gluten free; one of them shared this book with me - it's an absolute 'must read' - well written with just enough tech to prove his point and just enough common language to make it easy to understand.  Amazing what wheat does to our bodies.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|Really enjoyed the tracks on this purchase.  We love Vegas and this reminds you of the good old days giving you a glimpse of what it would have been like to be at his live show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I very much enjoyed this story, as a fan of post-apocalyptic worlds. It's believable, unpredictable, and very engaging. The storyline, characters, and science / engineering / psychology of the silo are all excellent.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Way too much flash bang, particularly at the end.  Lacks the subtlety of earlier Bond flicks.  Not sure why they killed off Judi Dench, but alas we now have a new &#34;M&#34;.  However, the color was great and the story line was outstanding.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I especially enjoyed the second part. Learned a lot from that and it is a book you can read multiple times and learn more each time.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have used this many times. i like they way it works. this makes my Kindle Fire that much more versatile. No complaints
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I tried to like this movie. Charlize was great. I just can't stand Kristen Stewart. Her rousing speech fell flat and I thought she looked and acted best when she played dead.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|this is pretty simple. if you like The Big Bang Theory then you will enjoy this. there are several of the episodes i really enjoy so i got this. No Complaints
B004S49YEM|5.0|Ken Follett writes sooo well!  His research is spot on and the plots in all his books just keeps you enthralled so you can't put the books down.  I particularly like the ones with the true history.  The Eye of the Needle is a good example.<br />Well done.<br />Lucy Davis
B001F6TXME|5.0|I used this frequently when i have my camera mounted on my tripod. it makes shooting very easy without risking bumping or vibrating the camera during a shot. No complaints
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because it is so fun to play and it is the best game ever made in the world.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Rise of the Guardians is a must see. There is nothing about this movie that I disliked, my kids and I absolutely loved it.
0689877692|5.0|You will be delighted with any and all of Carter's books.<br />Wonderful for all imaginations whatever the age to enjoy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The second Colleen Hoover book I read - I cannot wait for more.  I work with sexually abused children and found her awareness of trauma to be real!  The nightmares, the heart pounding physiological reactions and the escaping within - but most of all she gives us HOPE that despite the pain and sorrow of abuse one can overcome trauma and live life again.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Can't stop watching - amazing trip thru history and exciting!<br />Can't stop watching - amazing trip thru history and exciting!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars Album must have.<br />Got it at a very cheap price, just 1.99 how could<br />I say no to it.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Simple in concept, Trower re-interprets Blues standards and adds his own songs to the mix, to the point where<br />it is hard to discern which is which. This is an absolutely fantastic record. One that you will tell your friends<br />about, and they in turn will tell their friends about, ( hence the \\"pyramid reference\\" ). Anyone who enjoys<br />Blues influenced Classic Rock like Zeppelin's \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" will love this CD. A very early contender<br />for album of the year..just buy it !
B008JOLG7U|4.0|Tiene los mejores exitos de J.Lo y los mas<br />recientes asi que al precio que estava lo<br />decidi comprar y valio la pena,
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This isn't the kind of book where you get to know the characters or anything like that. It's a collection of interviews with key players from around the world talking of before, during and after a zombie apocalypse. It's different, but good. I would read more on the same subject.
B008XG1X18|5.0|What did we do without pinterest? Love creating my own boards and seeing others. Biggest and best time suck ever.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Like many others have said, I, too, experienced the same problems. The app runs very slowly, and the news feed does not show more than ten posts. There are no pictures displayed, and for some reason, they are not even loading. I found this app rather frustrating and I uninstalled it within ten minutes of downloading it from the kindle store. I actually prefer using facebook on the web.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|Was not disappointed in Return to Cranford . Well made and the flow of the story worked beautifully . Thanks for keeping these videos on Amazon.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Yes, this game is very addicting. I just love it, and it brings out my inner-villain. ;) Muahahaha! It is a very strategic game and I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a good strategy game!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It was very well written and I think the author captured the essence of the time frame whereupon these true events took place.  There were various moments during the read that one felt as \\"if you were there\\" in the midst of what is a simply amazing story.  It was fantastic too to see the perspectives and experiences from the two primary individuals upon which the book is written and although on opposite sides in WW II, in the end... although very different, they we're also connected together in so many ways.  Great read, great story!
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The story was weak, but if you are a ten year old maybe it is a great movie. Not worth the money, just rehashed garbage.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great movie, Came on time. I've been watching this movie over and over since i got it. Can't get enough.
1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly is full of information without reading like a dry text book.  I'm glad my son recommended I read it.  If you are not already opposed to GMO foods, reading Wheat Belly will win you over.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Came on time and in perfect condition. Have yet to finish the series but i love this bundle and the price i got it at.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very good! Being in college during the ttime frame of these events it was really interesting from this perspective! Thrilling!
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|James D'Arcy was wonderful as Tony Perkins.  Anthony Hopkins was too much like Anthony Hopkins and not enough like Alfred Hitchcock.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|The movie was good but not exceptional.  We were a bit disappointed that this was more of a \\"love story\\" as opposed to the reality of the history that took place.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is written in great detail allowing the reader to be transported to the scene. Amazing story that I will read again!
0670024813|5.0|His books are chock full of information and take a long time to get through, but they are worth it.  I liked Guns, Germs and Steel better, but his is a worthy read!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Love the series! Very knowledgeable and great camera work! The high definition is incredible! It almost looks fake it looks so real!
B004GYY714|4.0|love this app for the local stations has all i wanted<br />have few fav country stations that could not locate<br />searchnot so easy<br />for free app it is great
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Have watched all three seasons and can hardly wait for the 4th season to be available.  It always ends a season with a cliff hanger!
B004A2U4V4|5.0|I wasn't a big fan of Bon Jovi for awhile but I started getting into his music a few months back and decided to get some of his cds. When I saw all the great songs I opted for this album and listen to it all the time. So many great songs on here including ones that should be played more often on the radio but aren't and ones that are played far to much on the radio. Well worth it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers and I would recommend this game to anyone who would ask but it could be a bit better than it is. Nearly all of my friends play this game and they all love it but there not on all that much they were when they first got it but you get bored of it after a while. The only thing is that when they try to make it better it normally makes it worse and they miss out all the bits that everybody loves!!!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|really looking forward to this movie when it came out, but sorely dissapointed, a bunch of special effects strung together by moments of dialog maybe 3d in theater would have at least made it tolerable
B000VZUT64|5.0|Man, Listening to this album reminds me of just how good music used to be.Every single song on this album is good.Almost 40 years after it was first released it still has that edge.I am no music expert but I do not agree with Windows media classifying this record as Jazz,I would describe it as Bluesey Rock and Roll.
B00136S0NE|5.0|This album is great! I've listened to it nonstop since I bought a week ago! It's modern music which allows even  people who don't like musicals to love this album.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I thought this movie was freakin excellent. It opens up a whole new world to the Bourne universe and and turns this Bourne Identity thing into a franchise like Bond. Jeremy Renner is excellent and his hand to hand combat skills make Matt Damon look like a boy scout. I had no idea that these guys were genetically enhanced and not just trained to be elite assassins. I would love to see Damon and Renner together in the next Bourne movie trying to shut down the operation that wants to shut<br />them down. But if they do, there would be no more Bourne movies and that would suck.
B0022CY8WK|5.0|Excellent music but also the lyrics are outstanding. I enjoyed it and you will too. surrprised how good the mp3 sounded
B005PK56TA|5.0|Bizarre and twisted. Jessica Lang is wonderfully demented as a mother who has lost her family. This season was fantastic and gave me nightmares.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|kids love to play it. engaging. takes up a lot of sd space though. nice graphics. thinking required. what else to say....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed the second book as much as the first one. I love how an ordinary girl can turn a stubborn man around and see that love exists on different planes.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I really enjoyed this modernized version of the Sherlock Homes story.  Having been to London several times, I enjoy stories taking place in locations I've visited.  Wonderful acting as well.
B0074JODP8|5.0|Love the sound and video quality. A lot of entertainment by a fantastic blues guitar player. This item shipped fast and was well packaged.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Stunning performance<br />More material<br />What's not to like.<br />Get some version of this. Here or elsewhere, I'd suggest a local shop.<br />Either way, this is worth buying.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I completely hated the end and wonder what will happen now..... BUT I do love the series very very much!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Worked with no issues right out of the package.  The rest of this review is to get to the word minimum.
0761169253|5.0|This book is a quick, delightful read about working in a creative field. My only complaint is that it couldn't have been longer. Well written and easy to process.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|No story just a lot of fighting and shooting. I fell asleep. He is the worst bond not classy or good looking. There is no romance
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this movie. I have watched it many times and find that it was well worth the investment.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Great product v e r y h a p p y w I t h s e l l e r.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I really like the story of Prometheus and the quality of the acting. I really like it because they use new and basically unknown talent, I get so tired of the same actors over and over again that I found this movie really refreshing. I can't wait for Prometheus 2.
B004HZ76FQ|1.0|i paid 3.99 for this stupid ap it has a mere 10 levels that i beat in 2 day and that is only because i had to charge my battery stay away for this one it is a rip off
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great story. Beautiful details. It kept me enthralled and engaged. Beautiful use of descriptive words and the story was filled with great characters.
1567184855|5.0|this one might change how you see life itself. Incredible, well written, even for the skeptics out there, I am one of them!
B000FVQLQQ|1.0|Received the item and it didn't work. The description didn't even say that it didn't work. Needless to say I was disappointed.
0871164566|5.0|These pendants are very easy to make.  Your hands and fingers will suffer, but that is what you do as a artist!  This reference is a keeper in my art jewelry books.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book is not bad it just has too many characters,. and it doesnt get to the story until after chapter 8 , so it is kind of a drag;<br />not a bad read but little confussing at the begining.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is an excellent album especially if listened all the way through. It just flows really well. Good study music too.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an awesome game! love it love it love it the kids do too, they're better at it than I am!
B001BANK32|5.0|King's book had a much different focus than the Kubrick interpretation of this book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to any fans of Stephen King's books or the Kubrick movie.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The second season of GoT was great. The set pieces and acting were superb. I really enjoyed seeing the books I've read come to life and they've made it extremely accurate as far as screen adaptations go. There was a good bit cut out towards the end of the series, but if you enjoy the books, or the first season of the TV Series, you'll love this one too.
0765325950|5.0|I thought Brandon Sanderson did a great job coming in after the passing of Robert Jordan to complete this series.  This book was pretty much non-stop action from the first few chapters, I could hardly put it down.
1400067820|4.0|This is an interesting book and it certainly has stimulated a lot of reviews, many extremely long and detailed. So I read the reviews (or about 90% of them) after I read the book. Most of the reviewers get it - this is a wide-ranging philosophical treatise but one that is extremely ego-driven. What I found interesting is that many of the reviews are actually as much about the reviewer, that is, the ego-driven book has brought the ego-driven reviewers out in droves. Sort of like a modestly talented kid emulating the body moves (while not being able to actually play the licks) of a guitar player they admire.<br /><br />For more common readers (who perhaps have less self-awareness - not necessarily a good thing) there is one area that clearly illustrates how an interesting writer (like Taleb and his fan-boy reviewers) can miss an obvious point when one is convinced that one is special. Taleb prefers antifragility over that which is fragile but he is also contemptuous of the urge to robustness (making oneself indifferent to outlier events, i.e., the middle ground between fragile and antifragile.) This is because he sees robustness as a liability when the black swan arrives. BUT in practice a great deal of what in Taleb's view is misdirected activity (striving for robustness) has to do with the very human urge toward comfort and security. This is what government and for that matter civilization as a whole is supposed to be all about (I know we screw it up a lot but at least this is the idea behind robustness). An example from the book; in the medical realm (where Taleb spends a lot of time) robustness involves the avoidance of PAIN. A great deal of medical treatment focuses on pain (a symptom, not necessarily a disease) and how to reduce it (preferably as quickly as possible.) Most of the steps that reduce pain are not very helpful to the human body in the medium and long term (icing swelling, for example, which Taleb talks about) but are powerful motivators nonethelessand for obvious reasons. Now, make the short jump from physical pain to emotional pain caused by uncertainty and insecurity (financial for example) and you begin to have a better feel for the way the average person thinks and acts (the key phrase here is average person.) In this context, robustness is considered to be a wonderful thing, well worth it if the cost is to miss making a financial killing or advancing exponentially in some other way in the event of a black swan. Taleb doesn't seem to understand any of this. He is a great man intellectually, consumed by his own greatness and exalted position in life and therefore substantially detached from the rest of the world. I guess that is how philosophers are supposed to think and write.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and found it mentally challenging. But philosophically-speaking many parts of it had an alternate-universe feel to it that undermined its credibility. But it sure fired up the reviewers (including me.)
B00BHMETKC|1.0|The Academy Awards have always been, at best, a high school popularity contest.  What Argo represents with its Hollywood kudos and awards is a precipitous descent to the same in the lower grades.  Many one hour TV serials are far more deftly scripted, scored, filmed, edited, and acted than this sophomoric fiction.<br /><br />The characters, the primary characters (except the CIA operative), are all sniveling and unsympathetic...(an accurate depiction of State Department personnel, but poor protagonists for a heroic tale). The only tension came in the final scene which, by all accounts, never happened. Hollywood's role with this story was more prominent than the Canadians, which WAS heroic. Why?<br /><br />Thus, what was the agenda of the makers?
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry Bosch is what Stone Barrington  should be, tight and concise dialog and as always a good plot and surprising twists.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Loved this movie and the concept behind it. Ben Aflleck was great in this movie, too bad he wasn't up for Best actor award in the Oscars. I know is was based on loosely facts, but it was still entertaining to say the least. The whole cast what excellent. Glad Clinton declassified the incident so the story could be told.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|The story that couldn't be dreamt up. The director makes an amazing debut weaving the Rodriguez story while exploring elements of his music, the corrupt music industry, the improbabilities of the power of the reach of his music, how it moved his fans to find out about him, and about the unique humanity of the man himself.<br />An astounding achievement!
B008Y73940|4.0|I recall wanting to see this film at the movies, and sort of missed it. However, I must say I am happy I did not decide to pass this one up all together. This is a pretty good movie, with an interesting twist in the end! I truly enjoyed it!
B0043X1FL8|5.0|If you find yourself doubting your life or even trying to find a purpose for your life.<br />Try watching this movie, I believe it will offer you HOPE regardless of your current situation!
1574214276|4.0|This is similar to  a previous zentangle book, but offers a few more ideas and some interesting exercises.  Nothing completely new here though... it would be great for a new to tangling person.
B004XQO90O|5.0|This movie gives insight to possibilities as well as hope for those struggling with everyday choices.<br />This is a must see movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|She can spend hours with her horse.  lots of mini games to keep her busy.  lots of interaction with her horse makes it very realistic.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Great sound! Fresh! The chick can belt out a tune! I would highly recommend this album. Tell your friends and neighbors!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|The movie was overwhelming.  We had to watch it in two segments.  The farmers are getting screwed as are we consumers.  Yes, we vote by our purchases, but to a large degree they shove the products down our throat.  We will definitely make a bigger effort to buy locally AND to buy organic products.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read.I hated the ending though.Leaves you feeling cheated.I wanted a more dramatic final ending and it kinda just fizzled out.
B002C949KE|4.0|I'm really enjoying this book!  I can read it a little at a time and ponder the ideas and go back to it later and think about the things some more.  Very interesting take on things and helpful!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|great graphics fun game great for any age. I would suggest for any parent needing some spare time in their day.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I hooked up My Alarm clock to my 5.1 surround speakers and wake to my mp3 music &amp; my sound FX . It really gets me out of bed quicker. Plus the white noise really works for me. Great App!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm so in love with this trilogy. I was not really sold on Bared to you because I had just finished reading the fifty shades trilogy and the books are so similar. However, with Reflected in you was much more indepth with the characters and their stories....so much  better!!
B004JKLBUU|2.0|I ordered this book and paid $9.99 for the book and $8.99 for s&h. I got the book and it was a miniature book and on the back cover it stated $4.99. I feel like I got totally duped! When I complained to the company (not Amazon but a company that was selling on Amazon), they offered to take the book and refund me a little over $3.00 after s&h and return fees. If it had stated this was a miniature of the real size book I would not have bought it.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|It was excellent.  Just as I expected it to be.  Great acting, great series.  I would recommend it to anyone-who has not heard of it.  The purchase through Amazon was great.  Terrific customer service and great price.  Thank you!!!
0312330529|4.0|Up to the middle this book is marvelous, but then the story starts to lose it, the twists of the plot grow to be way too far-fetched and reading becomes somewhat laborious. The story line repeats itself and at the same time gets a bit too obscure, the protagonist behavior becomes fractured and inconsistent with the previously portrayed character. It might be the sheer length of this book however, that makes it hard to be engrossed by the narrative for the whole of almost a thousand pages.<br />Nonetheless reading Shantaram is definitely worth the while, it's no accident its paragraphs are cited all over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game on the kindle I lobe it and have hours of fun on it I suggest if you haven't got it then download it you would be stupid not too
B00846REIS|5.0|This trilogy continues in the same erotic love story as \\"50 Shades\\". You can't stop reading!!!. \\"Reflected in You\\" continues Gideon and Eva's dark love story. Can't wait til the release of \\"Entwined with You\\", the third book of this trilogy. Beautifully done Sylvia Day.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I don't like it becauseitis made very cheaply for the money had I known that I would nothave bought it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Ground breaking show that always leaves me wanting more. The unpredictable manner of the show keeps waiting to see what shoe drops each week
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married is a romance novel that is filled with a different kind of love story. I was intrigued by the content of love story. There are moments in this novel where you are kept in suspense of knowing what is really going to happen.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love flow free... and I'm good at it. This game will leave you sitting in one place for hours having fun with 5+5 to hard 10+10. If you like having fun and being challenged play this awesome game.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I am a model railroad operator at the Adventure Science Center in Nashville and this DVD was recommended to me by one of the<br />other engineers.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun game to play. I enjoy doing all the tasks that they have me do. I would recommend this game to all my friends.
1423140605|2.0|i have never had problems with Amazon book order but this time the book was never shipped and I had to call and have it shipped by UPS. I took the book abroad and the person I gifted it to said there are pages missing and some duplicate pages.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Patrick Stewart is great as usual.<br />Music was fine- nothing exceptional.<br />Worth watching- little scary for younger kids.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I read the book, then went to see the movie.  This movie is FANTASTIC!!  I was very happy that Jennifer Lawrence won the Best Actress Oscar for her role in this movie.  But also hat's off and applause to Bradley Cooper for his performance.  This film is about mental health.  An original story of a man who leaves a mental institution, and works on himself to get back his ex-wife.  However, he meets a young widow, and they start connecting as friends.  This movie is funny, touching, very watchable.  When this come out on Blu-Ray I plan to watch thos over and over.  You won't get sick of it.  A+
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston and Child are unparalleled.  This installment of the Pendergast series is no exception.  Enjoyed that there were a couple of threads going at once.  Just order the book and enjoy the ride :)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time on WWII<br /><br />I try not to insert spoilers in my reviews but that's hard not to do with this book.<br /><br />I learned some interesting things from this book. Our media has always presented Luftwaffe pilots as goose stepping nazis who were sometimes worse than the SS. Just about every movie I have seen they are blond haired, blue eyed,insane with hate people who were all card  carrying Nazis. The truth is a different story. According to this book a Nazi could not belong to the Luftwaffe. To be honest I have forgotten the reason why. I think the only Nazi in that organization was Goring himself. Goring was actually the Luftwaffe's worst enemy. he accused his airmen of being traitors and cowards even though the majority of his pilots did not live to see the end of the war.<br /><br />Our hero in the book, Franz, was not a Nazi. His family were not Nazi's either. Both his father and brother were killed during the war. All Franz really wanted to do was fly planes. He did not want to become a fighter pilot until after his brother was killed. He at first blamed the Allies and was on his way to winning the Iron Cross which required a pilot to shoot down 30 enemy planes. He was one plane shy of his iron cross when he met Charlie Brown's B-17 in the skies over Germany. Charlie's plane was so badly shot up that almost all of his machine guns were not working.<br /><br />Franz would have faced a firing squad if the truth had gotten out that he had let this B-17 escape. Just before this incident he had been investigated by the Gestapo for subversive activities against Hitler. Had Hitler won the war he would have probably been shot anyway because he was Catholic. Another untold story about WWII is the fact that the Catholic Church in Germany was working against Hitler and many Catholics died in concentration camps. For some reason all we hear today of this is that the Catholic Church did nothing at all against Hitler.

B002361MLA|5.0|A lesson for life.  I just finished it and want to read it again.  A great reminder of how to make a life, not a living.
B0076D21O2|1.0|If you like \\"period pieces,\\" with their elaborate costumes and expensive sets, you might give this film a half hour of your time. As a full length film, I could not get all the way through it. Bare in mind, I was an English major in college, and I studied Shakespeare's plays. I would not have been so aggravated had I rented this for a few bucks. Unfortunately, it was only available for $9.99 as a sale. I will delete it to save space. That is how big a waste I think this film really is.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I did relax when reading it, and passed some time! but I just do not understand why the book is so popular!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I look forward to my chance to watch it. Between Torchwooddr and Doctor Who, I don't need any other show!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I enjoyed watching this series and I'm glad I purchased the DVD of the first season.  Very compelling well written series.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My grandson loves this.  It really keeps his attention.  He loves the Choo Choo.  It also has boats and planes,,
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is definitely one to add to my all-time favorites list. I could not put it down. It's a tear jerker but such a great love story! I will definitely be reading other books by Moyes.

B00589BMF0|5.0|Everything's been said about this movie! My favorite comment: It was the first and most successful blending of the Sci-Fi and Horror genres!
B005QBBCMI|2.0|This movie was depressing and sad.  I could identify with parts of it, because we have alcoholism in our family.  I kept hoping for a miracle to happen...a recovery...but to me, it was just sad, depressing and pathetic.  But, Nicholas Cage did a fantastic job of acting!
B004LQA6MQ|4.0|Like most sequels, it gets tougher to keep the audience engaged. Because I enjoy sci-fi so much, I would have seen this unless it was rated terribly. However, there are enough new elements that my interest remained. Still not as good as the original, but not bad for the 3rd in the series!!
B008I34YYY|4.0|This was a pretty funny movie. Some of the politics were over the top stupid, but I guess that is what you get these days. However the CGI was fantastic, the quality with which it was done made much of it seem very realistic. Fun flick, I hope the make some more quality movies.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|why does it say kindle tablet edition but it wont let me download the game on my fire? i really want to play but i dont want to spend 3bucks for the paid option. highly silly.
6304711891|5.0|Just watched - This is the way action movies should be. Spell-binding, tingling, explosive, all nonstop action. Best I've seen in quite some time since 24. Great actors, really real like weapons and sound perfect. The car chase was sensational. Was on the edge of chair holding on. Great dialogue. Can't say enough about this film. Wish there were more like it. Anyone wanting nonstop action should see this, you won't be disappointed.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Fantastic and interesting concept about time travel and its possible consequences. The storyline kept me engaged and allowed me to understand values of the past and the historical theories about the assassination.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Have all of the Bourne movies and the are all good this one was no exception. Definitely recommended for those that enjoy action.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series has picked up pace with A clash of Kings. Can't wait to see what comes next... winter is near
B00ADS98FC|3.0|This movie is one that I enjoyed but my husband did not.  He thought that it was too girly.  A movie to enjoy if you like music.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is great! I've had it for about a month now, and it has yet to glitches, force close, etc. My friend and I absolutely love it, we're at a streak of 119! The thing that's also great about this app, is that if you or your friend breaks the streak, the app automatically resets you back to 1 instead of punching in you friends username all over again! Another thing I love, is that the chat option is sort of limited so, don't be afraid to start a game with a random opponent. Also, if you get the hang of it, you can earn coins really fast, so you can buy new colors or bombs pretty quick!<br />Overall, its an awesome app! Plus... If you think you stink at drawing, no biggie! Its free!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Not really a fan of this game. Matching Chinese tile gets difficult after a while. All begin to look the same.
6305428387|5.0|What's not to like about this true story of the Jamaican Bobsled Team that went to the Olympics?  Just the idea of being able to listen to that wonderful, beautiful Jamaican accent for the duration of the movie is part of the attraction for me.  The cast, the music, the comedy, the colors and the story itself--all wonderful.<br /><br />It's a story of loss & disappointment, struggle, perseverance, redemption, overcoming odds, comradeship and teamwork.  When I watched it for the first time I didn't know the story of this Jamaican team, so everything about it was new to me.  Without giving any details, when it came to the last AMAZING scene, I sat bolt upright and started to weep because of the tenacity of the team.  I've watched this movie many times since then and still get weepy when I see that scene.<br /><br />This is a great movie to watch with your children.  There are wonderful messages in it. There is some swearing in one scene--but not vulgar. No murder, no gore, no sexual content, just a happy movie with an inspiring ending that happens to be a true story.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a great story with really interesting and compelling characters.  I've always been a soap opera fan, but this story has class.  The language is clean and the events are human even though the setting is in the previous century.  The storyline shows the difference in classes and yet shows how all humans have similar emotions.  Today's general TV programming is garbage.  We watched this, uninterrupted by advertisements, instead of being subjected to the declining morality so prevalent in what is presented to the public today as &#34;entertainment.&#34;
0440237688|4.0|I enjoyed The Giver for it's amazing detail and insight into the group psychology of a people living as a social organism. They are a more animalistic one, fulfilling the basic needs of every individual and supporting the whole through every action. The reader can discover and learn from the new perspectives given from those who consider other lives and their choices common. I relate this book to the sudo-utopian landscapes like the one presented in &#34;1984&#34; by George Orwell. The characters are so easy to empathise with, which creates even better emotional response as the story proceeds. The buyer can rest knowing these pages are worth their twice their time and cost. Even still, i wish the story would continue in time even if it meant cost.
B007A2O3FO|4.0|We enjoyed this story but I wish there had been a little more character development.  I would have liked to see each &#34;time&#34; have more story line depth.  I feel like there is so much about each character that I wonder about.  Maggie Smith is a wonderful actress and holds the story together.  You can't miss by watching anything Maggie does.  And, I'm glad I purchased it because I will watch it again!
B000I9WW3G|5.0|its a wonderful movie i love it her attitude is great its a very very very funny movie get this movie to watch
B000NQPZCO|5.0|Donnie Brasco follows Joseph D. Pistone, or Donnie Brasco, an undercover FBI agent that successfully infiltrated the mafia; however, he eventually develops a genuine connection with the man who brought him in, Lefty. Donnie Brasco is a brilliant and immersive gangster drama.<br /><br />The story is very engaging and genuinely intriguing; you learn a lot about the wiseguy lifestyle and the undercover operations of the FBI. There are many scenes that are extremely tense; I constantly asked, \\"how will Donnie get out of this one?!?\\" I really enjoyed the last 30 minutes of the film, especially when you realize how deep their connection was. Never a dull moment as the film masterfully blends immersive dialogue, intense situations, and some brutal violence throughout, with some comedy occasionally tossed in. Johnny Depp and Al Pacino have amazing performances; Al Pacino particularly kept a consistent and realistic character throughout. The film also has a great soundtrack.<br /><br />The blu-ray of this film is excellent. The picture and sound quality are superb, considering the age of the film, and match the best prints around/recently released. This is the definitive version of this film.<br /><br />Overall, Donnie Brasco is a must-watch for fans of gangster/crime dramas; in fact, it's a must-watch for film fans in general. A superb and immersive storyline, magnificent performances, and an excellent soundtrack, don't skip this film.<br /><br />Donnie Brasco has strong violence and blood, and brief nudity.
B009SCRERI|1.0|I purchased this and downloaded it to my media server for my kids to watch.  However, thanks to Amazon's drm you can only watch it with their player.  So unless you plan on using unbox, don't bother downloading from Amazon.
B0094K1K42|2.0|Kinda slow and not much plot other than somebody trying to get an old boyfriend back.......<br />Would probably not recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely a wonderful read. Finished in three days, while working full time. Cannot wait to start the next book tomorrow

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book! I wasn't sure about trying the book after reading some earlier reviews as I am not a technical or detail oriented person, but I am so glad I got it. It was a great story. I will be looking for more books from this author.
B004811PMO|3.0|Happy to have it in our collection!. Will watch it again when we are in the mood mood for a musical.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|I watched this movie in my younger years. I bought this DVD to share with my younger family members. Now when they go to see the newer upcoming remake of The Great Gatsby, they can appreciate both eras of actors and movies.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Favorite book series to date - and I read plenty. Cannot wait for Day three. Characters are just too good not to love (or hate)
B0094BB4TW|5.0|if you're a Facebook junkie like me, then this app is for you. It allows you to view friends' walls and publish things , view your own wall and publish things too, chat, message, etc.
B001EMS2Z8|5.0|This is one of my family's favorite holiday movies.  Unfortunately, it is only shown a few times a year.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good story well acted with a strong cast.  The story is very funny, but with a good message and enjoyable for all ages.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A real pageturner. I just could not stop reading it and I recommend it to everyone who like a good thriller.
B003L77G38|5.0|I this show is awesome.  I love how there are different universes and how in each one there is a different version of them.  This is worth the money for sure.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This was so strange to watch, so difficult to follow, even for someone who has read the book.  The costumes were lovely, the set and cinematography was strange, and the acting was mediocre.  This story has so much to offer, but none of that was visible or accessible in this adaptation of Tolstoy's classic.
B00821OX98|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by any episode.  A good one that will keep your attention and a believable cast.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Good family movie. Plot keeps moving and the characters are enjoyable to watch develop. Its a Spielberg movie, so of course it's quality!
B001ERMYCA|5.0|Good album by them. One of my favorites, even if most people seem to hate it. Definitely a good point in their career.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved it! She should definitely keep the series going. Very engrossing characters. You cant wait to find out what happens. (Almost) as good as Kelley Armstrong
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I loved all the other BatMan shows but this one was just sick. Something very evil going on here. And I don't mean just in the movie. This rates a F in my view

B001TODCII|5.0|This show is riveting!! The story line captures you right from the start and keeps you in suspence all the way to the last minute. I absolutely loved this film. Great acting, great story, a real grabber, keeper!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|cool  comparison with other edition grab the copy now<br /><br />blind buy now<br />looks best in this class best gr8 fan
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but did not like the use of the &#34;F&#34; word 50 to 100 times.  I understand that everyone was stressed during this time, but I was offended by the constant use of it.  Ben Afflick was outstanding.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book! The romance, the humor, and the characters we can all connect with set this book apart from other classics. Jane Austen was a genius... who doesn't want to be Elizabeth?
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love the TV show for it's music and story.  This album is wonderful to have to relive those musical moments.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|this app is amazing.and worth it you will not be disappointed it does fraction there are not much out there get it
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|Why don't you have Bocelli's dvd \\"Love in Portofino\\"?  There are real talented artists on that program.  No \\"Pop\\" stars, just performers with REAL talent.  No \\"manufactured\\" nonsense on that one.  His wife does a beautiful duet with him.  The program, plus the scenery, is absolutely perfect.  Just watching the audience react is a treat.  \\"Passione\\" is for commercialism. \\"Love in Portofino\\" is for beauty and enjoymemt.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|I was unimpressed with the writing and the story.  I would not recommend it.  I have yet to finish the book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Can't. stop playing this game and it's the first mobile. game that I play with the sound on. Highly. recommend.
0380730405|5.0|This book was my type of book - classic and elegant - the suspense was low-key but smooth flowing and<br />the characters took on a life of their own
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Written in the tradition of poor young boy turns into superstar hero, I was hoping for a new series that would evoke memories of books by Goodkind, Jordan, Southwell and Pratt.  Sadly, Books 1 and 2 do not live up to scrutiny and become an average read for young teens.  In Book One, the princess is called Gwen, Gwyn and Gwynn in the space of a few pages; her face drops \\"for the first time\\" twice in one conversation and the word \\"site\\" is used throughout both books instead of \\"sight\\".  There are many more examples of where an editor is needed to add some polish, but these were the ones that jumped out the most.  Not recommended for discerning readers of this genre.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|SOUND AND QUALITY WERE VERY GOOD - NO COMPLAINTS - NO SCRATCHES OR SMUDGES<br />AND ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH - ONLY COMPLAINT I DO HAVE IS THAT AMAZON IS INUNDATING<br />MY MAILBOX WITH OFFERS - IF YOU COULD JUST TONE IT DOWN A BIT - THANKS
B004G606K8|5.0|I just read this book for the first time (I consider myself a fan of the fantasy genre and I had passed on this book many times during the past), and I have to say that I love it. The story and the characters could be considered cliche for a fantasy book, but is still funny and smells like the old days when a story could be simple and yet funny.<br /><br />The prose is not at the same level than a Tolkien book but the authors succeed at making you care about the characters and their motivations. The world of Krynn seems interesting, and offers a lot of potential for other books (which I already know that they exist), for example, you'll be wondering about Huma, the Cataclysm, the old gods, Raistlin's origin, etc.
1741797802|5.0|This book has been so helpful in planning my trip to India.  The layout is easy to follow.  It is broken down for quick reference.  Pictures, maps great!  Highly recommend!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book is about challenging many of the ideas or bias we have about successful people, in particular, the people considered to be &#34;outliers&#34;. For example, a lot people and parents think that talent and hard work is everything you need to success, and they could be right until certain degree, but the truth is that real outliers achieve success because there a lot of other additional factors contributing to their success besides innate talent and hard work.<br /><br />Give the book a try, I don't agree completely with certain ideas proposed here but I still recommend this book since it will make think and share the ideas for discussion with others.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The acting was good; torture scenes were difficult to watch. I don't know that it was the &#34;best picture&#34; of the year.
B00AA36RZY|3.0|I already owned a physical copy and I love it (it's one of my reference books), so I decided to buy a digital copy to read it using my iPad on the go. The content itself is great, sadly the formatting for Kindle is terrible, many of the pictures are very small, many of the tables or pictures don't look right, I had problems reading the text in certain diagram and pictures, etc.<br /><br />If you really want to own the Kindle version give it a try, but expect a book that was not properly edited and formatted for Kindle reading.
0345525558|4.0|I liked this book! I loved Diffenbaugh's [female] hero, who kept me guessing the whole novel (although the orphan backstory was the most predictable aspect, and was easy to fall back on when other character motivation was lacking) . Diffenbaugh's depictions of motherhood and nebulous family structures were refreshing. My favorite part is the actual flower dictionary in the back. I will be using this as a reference when gifting flowers in the future!
B00B7H3OFI|5.0|what more needs to be said.<br />Bonamassa does it again?<br />Is there anything he will not do?<br />Joe , baby, Joe
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Well written screenplay, well acted, well directed, and very entertaining.  Whether or not the movie is historically accurate isn't important.  It's close enough.  More importantly, it reminds us all of a spectacular, scary and sad event that took place greatly affecting 3 nations and more than 70+ people.  It will hopefully encourage those of us who remember the real event as well as younger generations to seek out the real story and learn about the real people that were involved.  We need to take a moment and remember everyone who suffered as a hostage and those who made the effort to rescue them.  Thanks Ben Affleck for reminding me.  I had forgot but now you've motivated me to dig a little deeper into the 'real story'.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I read very little Science Fiction, mostly because it's too hardcore for me. You wont find that here, John Scalzi has written a wonderful, fast and easy story, with enough story, background and well built characters that even a non SF fan could find something to like in this book.<br />I really enjoyed Old Man's War and raced through it in one sitting. I would really recommend this one if you are interested in looking at Science Fiction but don't know where to start.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Movement seems to be accurate.  Watch is light and easy to read.  Ordering Replacement NATO straps this week. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I did not care for the way the story ended.  She should have been brought to face what she did to all those people and he shouldn't have been such a wimp.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The storyline is great, held my interest.  Couldn't wait to see next program.<br />The actors that portrayed their roles made them totally believable.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Again was disappointed with all the outcomes.  I know it was a story but some things the mother did was a little far fetched.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Alhough I realize this is not a complete truth and a lot is fabricated, It's unbelievable that people were this ruthless and had no conscience as to how they conducted their lives.  Maybe this was written just for sensationalizm, but it certainly holds your attention and I looked forward to every new episode.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|As always Sophie Kinsella doesn't disappoint.  I read my first Kinsella book - Do you want to know a secret- a few years ago - I was recovering from surgery and my niece sent it to me.  It was great - so full of humor.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|If you are a woman, you will probably fall in love instantly with Jace. I found myself saying &#34;oh Jace&#34; aloud a lot! There is love, actions scenes, magic and great writing in this book! Read as many as you can before the movie comes out. It's so worth it. Must read!
B00633W614|5.0|I am a big fan of Jeffrey Archer and this story didn't disappoint me.  Can't wait for the release in May of new book.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This Seiko was purchase out of neccessity....my sister had pyrchased me a Laker watch for a Christmas present about 5 years ago. Well the crystal needed to be replaced and the stem to set the time broke. A jewler said the expense of the repair would be better spent towards the purchase of a new watch.......enter this Seiko. I wanted a watch that had value that did not say steal me. Now I need to purchase and inexpensive sports watch to wear at work. Love this watch!
B0042ETJU2|5.0|Skip 2, someone should be punished.<br /><br />This euro set plays great on my PS3 and other Sony Blue Ray player.<br /><br />Great extra features, def a great set.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Love the title and the story was very easy to relate to. The adult scenes didn't go too far over the top.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is super fun and addictive. It's only when you have played for a while and the game starts to glitch out. Even with the occasional glitches I still go back to play it. Good game to pass the time.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|This moview didn't even get all that good until the very end - like the last two minutes.  I was a little dissapointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app to access pinterest on your kindle. This is much better than the original generic app that only took you to the website. For a pinterest lover, I love this app!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|This is the first time I have ever seen it - believe it or not!  It was a good movie.
B005IS565S|5.0|I love this band, and this may be my favorite CD by them so far. Although as fellow FFDP fans know, that is a very hard choice. Nonetheless I would recommend this CD to all and any fans.
B006LSZECO|5.0|After seeing how many people did not like the ending. I found it satisfying after a great read that kept the pages turning at s rapid clip . Not the most like able characters , but flawed in a wAy that kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next . Great read and highly recommended .
0316228532|2.0|...or the slush-pile on some editor's desk.  That's probably where this novel would have ended had it been submitted under another author-name.  I loved the Harry Potter series, not for it's world and fantasy elements, so much as Ms. Rowling's genius with character and character interactions.  I do enjoy a well-written fantasy world, but frankly, other authors have done that aspect more deftly than Ms. Rowling did.  Her characters, however, invite deserved comparisons with Dickens' own cast of unforgettables.  I wouldn't go so far as to say she reaches Dickens' level, by any means, but she certainly is one of the few to approach his style of handling fictional persons in so totally unfeigned a manner.<br /><br />However...all the above is merely to say that I wasn't in any way looking for more Harry Potter when I picked up &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; this winter.  I'd been defending her new choice of subject matter to all the vocal critics around me, for months.  I thought--and I still do--that her greatest gifts could be allowed full reign if unencumbered by the demands of crafting an alternate universe.  In short, I was very open to whatever of her imagination I was about to find between the covers of her latest work.  I swear, I was!<br /><br />I couldn't finish this book.  It was sooooo dull.  I completely agree with the NY Times reviewer, Michiko Kakutani, who called the characters that inhabit Pagford, the village setting for &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34;, flat, and cardboard.<br /><br />I have to confess that I'm not a big fan of the literary fiction genre, where the purpose of characters seems to be to persuade the reader that human beings are basically an unlikeable species who'll never be invaded by aliens, because they'll have bored the alien scouts to death before an invasion could get organized.  So perhaps, since this novel clearly wants to be in the lit fic league, I'm a little biased.  However, I didn't set this book down simply because it reached aftera literary style.  I set it down because it's author wanted me to follow the details of the lives of people she couldn't be bothered to like, herself.  And I just couldn't do it.  If there had been even one character whom the author loved, no matter how undeserving, that might have been enough to persuade me to stick in there, and see what she intended.  There wasn't, though, and I didn't.<br /><br />  Every great artist has to produce a few stinkburgers in between the good stuff, and in my opinion, Rowling has shown herself a great artist.  Maybe next time.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book was much more than I expected - deeply felt characters, and not just focused on the JFK assassination - some classic Stephen King elements re the horror that humans can be.  I enjoyed it a lot.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I remember loving this movie growing up and when I found it on amazon I was excited to finally watch it again...Now I remember why I loved this movie so much, you can relate to these girls. It's a fun movie that will have you laughing. I highly recommend this movie. It's a must see!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Short book but another of my favorites! Stephen King is an amazing writer. Hard to put down his books. Incredible.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|What a great movie. It's exciting and the characters are awesome, especially Bane. Tom Hardy is one of my favorite actors after seeing him in this and Warrior.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|One of the most moving CDs I have picked up in a LONG time.  Absolutely beautiful. This music takes you to another place.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|I absolutely love this album by Calvin Harris! It is up beat and fun, especially when you are working out and need a good paced playlist! He also features a lot of talented and well known artists on this album (florence & the machine, Rihiana, etc.)! Calvin Harris is brilliant!
1401937519|3.0|I only have a few issues with this book.  One:  There was too much repetiion and this book could have been half the pages.  Two:I was a little confused as to why Anita allowed herself to undergo chemotherapy upon her coming out of the coma when she \\"knew she was already healed\\" - she said something like.  \\"Oh, if the doctors wanted to do it, it was ok with me but I knew I really didn't need it\\".  I mean really?  Who would allow that poisen to be introducted into their bodies if they knew they didn't need it.  That seemd rather \\"off\\" to me.  Overall the book was good in certain areas.  I always love reading about NDEs.  One thing I was reminded of is obsession and fear of anything puts way to much emphasis on it and you may attract the thing you fear.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I love subway surfers and I  think that it is a fun game and addicting game to play lot of awesome prizes and also money included
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have the first three seasons. Occasionally hook up th HDMI cable on my Kindle and watch a few episodes on their TV when visiting friends. You can't go wrong with this series.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Lord have mercy this one was the best so far. The twists and turns, the wall especially, what happened to Jon was ridiculous and in the next book I can't see how it turns out.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is a good book with an intriguing story line.  i thought it had to many unnecessary details in spots.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I have seen and read so much about the &#34;Iran crisis&#34; and remember the tensions of the time. I cannot believe how fresh this all seemed when I saw &#34;Argo&#34;. Even though I knew the outcome, I was on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. It definitely deserved its awards.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|My title says it all, this is a nice basic case, nothing fancy, but does what it should.  The kindle snaps into the case tightly and the inside of the flap is flocked, which is nice and soft on the screen. The flap also functions as a stand and it works quite nicely. It would be nice if there were more than one stand position, but for the price this case is great as is.
B005IQZB14|1.0|Seriously this is the most pathetic trail book I've read. Even after all those miles on the PCT this idiot failed to realize that her &#34;success&#34; was only a mixture of dumb luck and the beneficence of nearly everyone who came in contact with her. The author is a terrifically destructive and self absorbed woman. I doubt writing this book changed that since the trail experience didn't. How does the graphic retelling of her stupid and dangerous behavior benefit anyone? I get the distinct impression that recounting it only served to validate it for her. And I can only assume she recounts her idiocy to give credence to the title. Epic Fail. I not only came away from this read disgusted by the author I also have pity and compassion for her family and the others her destructive nature touches. Some more fitting titles would be: &#34;Idiot&#34;, &#34;Trainwreck&#34;, or even &#34;Lost&#34;. Don't waste your time or money on this ridiculous author.
B003VIWO9I|4.0|As with all of  his books this one will both entertain and amuse and at times make you laugh out loud.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This is Sinatra in his (second) prime.  He's a headliner, in fine voice, backed by the great Count Basie Orchestra. The acoustical quality is excellent and the band seals Sinatra's performance, never overwhelming it.  Some songs really swing, while others provide subdued embellishment to the singer's performance, a chemistry surely derived through  long collaboration. Consider this recording a prime example of what made him great: mature voice, showmanship, and superb musicianship
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Why do I feel like this book was based on Valentine's day. Plus I noticed that the third wheel was Greg because he went to the dance with Rowley and Abigail
0062082353|5.0|A most interesting story and for the type of work this SEAL did it was easy reading without the &#34;gore&#34;.  I would recommend this to any American patriot.
B009YX02T8|4.0|Decent. I really only bought it for the one song that I'd heard, but the rest of.the songs on the al um weren't too shabby either. So... all in all I rated it a 4.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|This was purchased for use with a smartphone to provide backup power.  This power pack has a wonderful capacity and provides several top off charges before needing recharged.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Several offline versions, bookmarks, and Daily Verse are great features. The wide choice of good versions is great. Almost direct look-up is amazingly fast.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Thrilling, more excitement an drama and surprises. Love the new characters and the ending. I am ready for book three.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool! If you think $6.99 is too much money, well then your out of luck because the most greatest game is just that much! I liked how you could do creative mode and survival mode. In surviver mode, there are zombies, creepers, and skeletons that shoot bows at you. If you get near the creepers and they see you, they will blow up and kill you. But in creative mode, you can build anything you want with all the supplies you want. I would assume that this game is like many other games where you get to build and stuff. But after you built your house and your bored, thats when you put down the game and go to another game because this game may get boring after awhile. But if you are on survival mode, try to sill the animals because they give you meat and stuff. To eat the meat, you hold down on something and then you can hear a munching sound. But this game is totally worth the 7 bucks.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love this game! its one of the best horse games ive played!! anyways I would definately recommend. this game to horse lover's!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Its way better than the first one. But to keep your man alive longer you have to use real money to get gems.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book! Lots to twists and turns in the plot. And when you think there can't be anymore there is. A beautiful story of young love, devotion and secrets long forgotten. Highly recommend!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The main character has immense skill and talent, however his personal flaws kick his butt, but he redeems himself in the end by revealing character and integrity.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Be SURE to test this DVD as soon as you get it.  The return window is short, and our discs won't load in 2 DVD players.  We're stuck with a bad product.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Daniel Craig is, to me, the best Bond since Sean Connery. My wife thinks he's getting a little long in the tooth to play Bond much longer, though.
B006YC74E8|4.0|My daughter enjoys playing with the camera, It let's her play with the photo in edit. easy to use. Good for kids
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Immensely entertaining and you get to know the characters so quickly that you feel like you know them and you care about them.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love this book and the story it tells! Family conflicts, true loves, and more are only the beginning of this amazing story. A typical Nicholas Sparks, you'll enjoy reading the book and fall in love with the main characters only to endure happiness and sadness by the end. Enjoy!
B002O2THRO|3.0|The characters don't translate to the present time for me, however the story is timeless tragedy. The Greeks told this story many times centuries ago.
1453624910|2.0|Really love a story that immerses me in with characters and setting, which the other Nightrunner books do.  I guess I'm just not a fan of short stories.  They were too disjointed, too choppy, over before they really began.
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|This Product is useless for me, because it's RegionCode dongled. It works only on Region 1/A devices. Welcome in a global World-Market.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This show has had me hooked from the first.  I love Sam and Dean and their dedication to each other thru a LOT of trials!  I've watched the whole series every time I got a new season plus some.
0385342063|5.0|If you have ever seen a chick flick before, you can pretty much guess everything that is going to happen after you read the first chapter. I could imagine this as a movie right from the start and the limited time I spent thinking while reading it was whom I would cast.  Still, it was a good, light novel and one that I will recommend to friends.  It is not one with deep philosophical importance or one that will stick with me a long time, but it was a fun read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is the best drama's on TV.  Thank you AMC...  It was very easy ordering the Walking Dead through Amazon..
B0010SKTRA|5.0|After reading Shubin's latest book and enjoying it very much, I followed links to this one. It's even better in some ways, extremely interesting.<br />It's accessible to the general public, yet technically sound as far as I can tell.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Skyfall is far closer to the James Bond of the books, it is well acted, the plot is good, the dialog is also very good. It is in my opinion in the top 3 Bond movies made, if not the best.
B006KAWI2C|4.0|This is the first time I am disappointed in Amazon.  This product is a box set of 144 CDs.  The set and CD quality is excellent.  The problem is that the set was missing 1 disk.  Other purchasers commented on the same problem.  I did not want to return the set, only to receive another that could be missing one or more CDs.  The manufacturer said it could not help and that I had to go to where I purchased the set.  Amazon wouldn't help, other than to return the entire set for refund or replacement, which I did not want to do..  So, I cannot get the missing disk.  If you want to purchase this set, and it is an excellent compilation, find it in a store where you can open the sealed package at purchase and verify all disks are there.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  It keeps me from getting nervous during basketball games.  I enjoy the tile&quot;s colors and styles..  Thanks
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|What is not to love about the Richard Castle books.  Love a good mystery and these are my favorite characters.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I take my kindle everywhere, thank God, because I could not stop reading Gone Girl. The evolution of a narcissistic anti social personality was fascinating.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this book as an e-book and was very happy with it. Its very easy read and he explained  a lot about what went on their over in the war. So yes would recommend the book to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app out there, and it is free. Has many versions of the Bible and the ability to highlight verses.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is the one of the clearest NDE's I've ever read.  It made me feel good!  It is also a reminder that death is nothing to fear.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|I love this Christmas theme movie. Very funny with great characters. It is a must see movie for the holidays.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones are a great buy at around 10 bucks. They stay put while you are moving around so they are great for anything active like running or working out at the gym. I purchased these headphones in Aug. 2011. I use them approximately 3 times a week either working out at the gym or running outside. They still work great.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|This Amazon app is way better than iTunes. WIDE SELECTION OF MUSIC. Very easy to use and inexpensive.  get it!
B002ZG9774|3.0|The most enjoyable parts of this movie are the lavish production numbers and Cam Gigandet being all sexy.<br />It's all fluff, so if you like cotton candy, you'll probably enjoy this.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Good actors and action. Entertaining program that keeps your attention. Actors interact well and that helps keep the flow of program going.
1401324649|5.0|This was a great buy, very reasonable price and shipping rate. The book was in great condition when I received it, and I have not noticed any stains, or any rips. I love the book so far, and overall I'm extremely happy with my purchase!
B000X9PNOG|5.0|I have been a fan for years. I find Meatloaf's songs so different to many artists. They are more mini operas instead of short songs which is what most music sounds like today. Not his best concert but like always he gives everything he has to the performance.<br /><br />Money well spent. I have listened to it several times since buying it.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|wish it had more from the movie & that it had some extended versions of some of the songs (but those I would've like extended were the same length as they were in the movie)<br />arrived on time & in great condition & has gotten A LOT of play in my car for the morning drive... :-)
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|&#34;It's a random killing machine rather than a personal statement&#34;...Q<br /><br />Rather boring, so predictable, just more of the same old stuff...
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Typical Jack Reacher book.  Keeps your interest throughout the book.  I've read all the &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; novels thus far and have found them all a good read.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I did not realize that it was an R when I ordered it, and I don't watch those because I don't like profanity and promiscuity. This had plenty of both, and I couldn't watch more than about 10 min of it, and it landed in the garbage.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Good read, as all the Lee Child's Jack Reacher books have been.  I've enjoy reading this series and plan to continue.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|this movie was superbly cast, brilliantly acted, with the costuming so beautiful. the setting couldn't have been better. I can hardly wait for the next season!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My 5 year old says its so amazing he wants to play it everyday. I never want to stop playing. I love it love it!!!!
B005S9EJ14|2.0|What I was told was British humor left me cold. the setting was beautuful, but with all the great actors, I expected better.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I like to put and play monsters all day long. It is cool. I like the pudding guys. I like pushing them.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Of course I now have a Blu-ray boxed set of this but I've held on to these also. Great movies and totally worth the extended versions. I can't wait for the Hobbit to be released in boxed sets. I'm going to be all over that! It is an awesome buy if you don't have a Blu-ray player.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Any one who enjoys reading and was born in the eighties will enjoy Ready Player One especially gamers or yes even facebookers
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I really didn't like Android OS. The phones sucked with it and I bought what were suppose to be the best Android Phones. No more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome. My family loves it. My kids never put it down. The grfics are ok but the concepts is a little wrong.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Hate Android OS after the phones I had with the Android OS all sucked. I mean serious, total suck fest for a phone OS.
0920668372|5.0|I read from a new mother to purchase this book. I did & I cried as I read it to my newborn son.
B008QI6EHQ|1.0|I can't believe I finally read this. It rambles on and on and on. I mean, MY GOODNESS one chapter took FOREVER to read. He just rambles and oh yeah he blames everything on the Jews and Gypsies. Everything was their fault and none of it was his or other peoples. What was strange was that it reminded me of some of the present day right wing books written today where it's all someone else's fault. Not just a person but an entire group of people. YEESH. It is a must read for WWII buffs especially if you want to get into the mind of Hitler and wow, his mind is NOT a pretty place to be!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Really?  This baby could actually have been magically conceived?  And then magically coincidentally due on the couple's 6th anniversary when just the previous anniversary was when wifey seemingly disappeared? I'm sorry, I'm not buying any of this dopey story!!!!!!
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|I have the DVD's and decided to upgrade to Blu-ray. Awesome images and awesome sound. Really enjoy these movies. If you're a Harry Potter fan you MUST update to Blu-ray!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|one of the only games i go on my kindle! really fun going doen the zipline! I also like how u have to do things to level up!
B004WMKXWM|5.0|Harry Potter must have. I love this entire series of movies. Yes I have them both on DVD and Blu-ray. I know, I'm sad. But it's well worth it.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Loved the series when I watched it originally, and wanted to watch it again, as well as introduce to my girlfriend who has yet to see it. Blu-ray version is incredible both sound and audio.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|Bought a rear view mirror windshield mount and needed additional pieces to perfect what I wanted to do. Works as described.
B001E70RT2|4.0|Everything you wanted or didn't want to know about beings you may have heard of, and a lot you haven't. Very cool book!
B000W10AEI|5.0|I have the DVD's and decided to upgrade to Blu-ray. Awesome images and awesome sound. Really enjoy these movies. If you're a Harry Potter fan you MUST update to Blu-ray!
B002BC9YSY|5.0|This is..without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made....<br /><br />It's a comedic classic and nowhere near a \\"S*** Sandwich\\" like some critics seem to pawn upon Britain's loudest band.<br /><br />Run, don't walk to a keyboard and order this on Amazon.<br /><br />.I've heard some of these discs may have been mixed in THX Dublee...but, Ive never heard of that  technology.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|However, I no longer use Android OS. The OS sucks. Serious SUCKS. I would avoid Android OS at all costs as it just isn't as stable as iOS.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I love this new case for my kindle.  It protects my kindle and is in my favorite color!  Great product!!
B0051QIGP4|5.0|It's a great album. I love Born this way. If you like Gaga then this is for you. Buy it today!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Fully entertaining. I enjoyed the suspense, and even the mystery. The writer knows how to keep you interested, and wanting more!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I love reading the original book. It's awesome. Did you all know that there are many versions of this out there? Definitely a good read!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a must have!!! If you are trying to get in shape, tone up, lose weight, improve fitness...or even just feel great... then buy this DVD. WORTH EVERY PENNY. I started seeing results by day 5. Simply amazing. Delivers what she promises. Just do it. I am on day 13 and I cannot believe how much my body has changed so far. I did not even think it was possible. The results I am seeing today... I was not even hoping for to see by the end of day 30. WOW just WOW
B002BWP49M|3.0|I'm not really hooked on these movies but I don't mind watching them. Well mostly for the eye candy which is Taylor Lautner. Plus I like Vampires and Werewolves. I do have issues with schparkly vampires but these movies hold their own. The first few were the best. These last two (part 1 and 2) don't seem as good and I didn't know actors could get worse at acting. I thought they only got better? Oh well, C'est La Vie.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|This is an awesome series (narrative, costume design, special effects)  and I could watch it over and over again. My only complaint is that at times for a second or two, the video quality gets a little blurry.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Definitely a show to watch over and over again. Everything is amazing about this series. It's like watching one long continuous zombie movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read the first and now the second in the series. They are riveting, I had to read until I was finished and can't wait fir the final book
B00021R7CG|5.0|A totally good movie to watch. You have to put yourself back into the days of the cold war which I grew up in. I really liked it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|There are quite a few 3D movies out their now. A lot of them have very little 3D effects and just a depth perception feel to it. Out of the 8-12 3D movies that I have seem thus far on my 55&#34; LG Cinema 3D HDTV, this movie has the best 3D effects &#34;hands down&#34;!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Read all three books.  Loved the story line and once I finished one I couldn't wait to read the next. I'm not a huge reader so for me to read all three books in under 2 weeks, that's saying something!  First book, for me, started to loose interest towards the end. Too much of the same thing over and over with the story line kind of stalled out but the second and third books didn't do that.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|I purchased the Schleich Rex for my grand son.  I was greatly surprised that the mouth opened and closed.  They are made sturdy and I have no fear of younger children playing with them.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|Overall it's a good mix of  sound, but the question that I have, on the mix it's hard to research who the artist on the mix, so that I can actually fine out who the artist is, so I can heard the whole song
B0013HYLT0|5.0|Loved watching this musical when I was a child! Praying for my very own Mary Poppins to just show up and make life sweeter! Brings back memories.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Though I am not a huge fan of the zombie genre, I really enjoyed this book. I enthusiastically recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Being in the area when JFK was assassinated, King did a good deal of  background work on his subject.  Don't usually enjoy Stephen King's other genre, but this one kept my attention.  Long book, but well worth the read.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Whenever someone asks for a book recommendation, this is always one of my first suggestions. I have always absolutely loved this book. Heller's ability to ping-pong between hilariously dark humor to incredible pathos is brilliant.
B007HU4FZ2|4.0|well worth the experience. Stream or buy it today.  The  actor who played Jesus could not have been a better choice...Jm Caviezel<br />Watch &#34;PERSON OF INTEREST ON TV TO SEE HIM TODAY.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Very good movie, I really like it, but this was actually a gift for a friend, it wasn't for me.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The dancing was weak. Matthew McConaughey was cheesy. The best part was in the beginning when he is talking about what the audience can touch. Channing Tatum is a skilled dancer, but he basically did the same moves over and over. The story line was predictable. I know really we ladies watch this for the stripping but that was pretty lame too, with very little cloths coming off. Overall just a lame movie.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Rise of the Guardians was a very good movie with very good voice acting talents. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|I know a lot of metal heads out there will stick their nose up at a band that plays with a Symphony but Metallica did it right, this DVD or CD is good stuff, all the classics with the symphony behind them really adds an extra depth to their music.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|It was good but not as good as Downton Abbey.  I thought the first season was too short.  A few more episode would have been appreciated.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I would much rather download his music, But i guess he is forcing us to buy the whole cd. I would never buy all of his music, so his hits cd is all i can do.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.<br />The reader perceives that there is more to the story<br />and that secrets are being kept but it is still a shock<br />when the truth is revealed.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|This was a gift for one of my grandson's who is a Lego lover.  He seemed thrilled to receive it.
B000I3UMLQ|2.0|Star Trek 5 is one of those movies that has you scratching your head. After the successful Voyage Home from 1986, we're treated to a very inferior movie that has a thin plot (stealing the Enterprise), as well as the introduction of Spock's brother. Brother? What is this? Ok, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Then, for those who like the serious-minded Spock as opposed to the newly-humorous Spock from the previous movie, there's sort of a hybrid approach as to how to present him. Spock has humor, but he's also serious, thus the goal of appealing to both audiences. This film veers way off course, with campfires in Yosemite National Park and singing Row Row Row Your Boat. This is extremely tacky, irrelevant, and annoying. And it's perplexing that some of the plots in these movies are so odd, as if there are no ideas out there. It seems as if every other Trek film is weak, as if the entire cast and crew go on vacation and subsequently not apply themselves. Though I initially supported the decision to keep Roddenberry in check with calling shots, I now think that ignoring him totally has been a mistake in terms of some films underperforming. This movie is weak for the most part. I give it 2.5 stars, and recommend it only for die-hard fans.
B005LAII80|5.0|Having a 3d tv it's hard sometimes to find new movies in 3d. The 3d effects in this one were pretty nice at times and just great in general. Although I miss stallone in this one, I thought it was done much better than the original. It's not something I'd watch over and over again, but for 20 bucks for a 3d film it was worth the money if you like generic action movies.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Trouble With The Curve isn't the most catchy title for a film, but being an Eastwood fan (as well as baseball fan), I decided to check it out. With a solid  cast (Amy Adams, Eastwood, Timberlake) this movie showed promise early on. Eastwood plays an aging baseball scout whose vision is deteriorating, and in the end, despite not being able to see players' mechanics clearly, he manages to use his wisdom, experience and 'hearing' to still be the best scout in the business. His daughter is an attorney who's so caught up in her work, that she forgot how to 'live'. A strained lifelong relationship with her father comes to a head when she accompanies him on a scouting trip to North Carolina. There, they clash, until her father finally tells her the reason why he wasn't in her life for many years. With his visual impairment affecting his evaluation of players, she takes over and ultimately finds a true gem of a pitcher who easily strikes out baseball's top prospect, with (you guessed it) the curve ball. It was this prospect that Eastwood said wasnt good enough for the Braves to draft, because he couldn't hit the curve, but they did so anyway. This movie has a nice touch to it, and carries a message of forgiveness and love. Recommended.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I don't read a lot of Nicholas Sparks book but did enjoy this because it had some mystery to it and I do like mysteries.  I also saw the movie.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This item was just what I needed.  It holds my kindle in place and keeps it safe where ever I go!
B000002IO8|5.0|I ordered this CD for my husband.  He really enjoys the Modern Jass Quartet a lot.  The price was very reasonable and received the CD in good condition since it was mailed from England.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This show is Fantastic. The International Version is the only one to buy. With the 24 minutes for extra film it tells so much more to the story. I am glad I bought this Version.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game, I approve. Has many different levels great graphics and its so fun to play. I can't wait to compete the next level!
