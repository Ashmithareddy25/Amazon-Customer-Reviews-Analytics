B00B5C0YOO|4.0|1, the &quot;start backup button&quot; should be clearly labeled so that people using the application for the first time won't accidentally press it unless they really want to.<br />2, If you accidentally push the start button you should be able to stop the application!
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Couldn't really get into it that much just not my kind of game . But hey, someone else may enjoy it. Not everybody the same. At least it's Free or was for me. Still recommend this app u may like it .
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books were so good didn't want to finish them I Love Christian and Anastasia !!!!! ......The Bomb!!!! I want MORE.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|Enjoy this app. Reading it give is much right on . Would recommend this app to anybody . Easy to use . Did pay for the future reading just to be able to read all cards I pick out. Fun, entertaining app. That the fact it's angels in which I like and collect .
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app. My BFF and I have fun killing each other I the online game. This one does not have all the things the online one does so u might like the online one more. But you really should buy this it is the best thing I bought. The only time I can buy this is when I have a gift card cuz it's so expensive. The reason I knew about this is cuz my older brother had it and I got to play it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|&#34;The Room&#34; is a variation of the &#34;locked room&#34; games, and it's a good one. Where it differs from most locked room games is in the graphics - which are superb - and the difficulty of the puzzles. The artwork in the graphics of the room and the devices in the room are about as realistic as it gets, and they looked great on my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34;. The puzzles range from tough to extremely difficult, but so far (I'm on the 3rd level now) they're doable, and they really force you to get your mind in high gear.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys the challenge of solving puzzles.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|SIMPLY AMAZING!!<br />I couldn't put it down it's such a beautiful story. I can't wait to start the last one!
B001NOD0Q8|3.0|I was a \\"young adult\\" when this came out but didn't read it until now (my 40's), because the movie brought it to my attention.  I haven't read much science fiction in a long while but enjoyed the first 2/3 of this book.  I enjoyed the psychological warfare of Ender's training and the battle room was easy to envision with Card's excellent descriptions (I look forward to seeing how the movie brings this to life).  The Valentine and Peter character development was also fascinating reading.  Once Ender left the school, the plot accelerated rapidly, as if Card was rushing to quickly wrap up a potentially massive story arc, and it the plot leapt from revelation to revelation.  I presume he expanded things with the other volumes in the series, but I'm not really interested in further reading after the disappointing ending of what I understand to be one of his better books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter and I can't stop playing this game! It is by far the best free app ever! Before you know it you're playing it when the kids are asleep.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Superb in every conceived level! The closest any of us mortals will get to see vintage Genesis live ever again. BRAVO MR. HACKETT!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very entertaining, fast paced, good versus evil, teamwork, overcoming personal failure, couldn't ask for more to make an evening of family fun. Loved it!
B0019NB9A2|5.0|There are certain classic Sci-fi movies that I truly enjoy and Forbidden Planet  is one of them.The plot is original and though the acting is a bit &#34;campy&#34; ( well more than a bit), it is a good  story. This movie would be shown on TV when I was a child and scared 'the dickens' out of me. Now, I can just enjoy the show. Plus, who wouldn't love Robbie the Robot?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works GREAT for the features it has so far. Hulu+ working now. Can't wait for more apps to get on board like Twitch and HBOgo, but great so far.
B000035Z3K|5.0|It's a Classic! Bella Lugosi is the perfect Dracula for this film. Edward Van Sloan is wonderful as Van Helsing. If one watches 'Dracula' ,with the era this movie was made, in mind, it is a perfectly enjoyable film.
B00915G6R6|5.0|I have watched every season since number one and the show still keeps me interested and coming back for more.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app is top notch but Amazon app market won't let me install on my Kindle Fire. I've submitted a support request to Amazon and hope they correct this issue soon.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Love the show and the cast of characters. Have watched it from the beginning episode and will watch season four
B001CSS4V6|5.0|This is my favorite Jeremy Sumpter film, and with the high definition of Blu-ray the picture and sound is equal to the theater experience.
B00F8LPH90|4.0|Even on my Motorola DROID X with 500MB of RAM, this app runs smooth, good frame rate, and just plain exceeds my expectations.<br /><br />As others have stated, this game is addictive as all heck.  If you don't want to pony up the cash to unlock the next map you have to replay the same map over and over. I didn't mind this because, in the end, it's just more practice and upgrades to kill more and earn more per kill! ! :-D<br /><br />Kill 3 civilians and it's all over.  Sometimes the civilians like to &quot;run with the zombies&quot; so you'll need to decide if attempting to &quot;snipe&quot; a zombie from an AC-130 is worth being one step closer to GAME OVER.<br /><br />Slick screens and user-friendly menus show that a lot of thought went into making this game.<br /><br />It's a really good game but lacks the extra oomph to get 5 stars - although it's a close call!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted and really happy that it is now on my kindle.  Five stars for having different types of levels to keep me challenged and not bored.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Wonderful film starring Navy SEALs from the Coronado, CA SEALs training facility.  The SEALs are by far the best trained military unit in all the Armed Services, that's why they're used for our country's most dangerous missions.  No disrespect to the other armed services branch, I'm sure you have great soldiers too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Lovely,thoughtful book with wonderfully quirky main characters.  Most intelligent teenagers on earth, but the book would not have worked any other way.
B00AEFXZJE|5.0|Great film, rollicking fun with Kevin Bacon.  Really a fun movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch.  You won't be disappointed.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun game but takes so long to regenerate energy. I'm impatient and find myself spending too much to play the game,but I'm addicted now so what's a girl to do.
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|Very good concept. I would love to see the graphics fine tuned a bit and it seems that after you finish the main campaign it loops back and you start over. There is a lot of potential for this game and I would still recommend giving it a try.
B00EQF0JJC|4.0|An incredibly fun and unique take on a classic Shakespearean romantic comedy. It's also both aggressively Whedonian, and weirdly California, if that makes any sense. Still, if you like Whedon, and his usual cast of actors, and/or you like this play, it's very much worth a watch.
B00BWQW73E|3.0|I've worked at Amazon for 9 years and loved it. I've learned much and been a part of an amazing program - FBA. I liked hearing many if the historical aspects, of how so and so joined or who was where when. However I thought many of the characterizations and interpretations are wrong. I've been in many JeffB meetings and he and the other VPs never fail to impress with their big thinking. Jeff has a very high bar for clear thinking and strategic data driven analysis and he holds people to that high bar but I've never felt he was vindictive. Much of the content in the last two chapters has already been covered in recent articles the author wrote in market this book and many topics felt jumbled together to fit it all in.  Regardless interesting for the anecdotes but not always for the interpretation.
B0017VG69U|4.0|great audio and video restoration plus digital sfx. on a judder-reducing tv set it looks like it was videorecorded yesterday!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy this came out for Kindle! I now don't have to play on my iPod! Even better, I didn't loose any levels because of connecting to Facebook! Thanks!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and definitely fun to figure out what to do!<br />I would recommend it for anyone who likes brain teaser puzzles.
B009FZFONO|3.0|This show is going downhill fast and the decline started with Season 3. I only watch the new episodes now in the vain hope that the writers will have miraculously stopped smoking marijuana and started using their fingers rather than their elbows to type. Maybe this week they'll have sobered up, realized with embarrassment that they've been sitting on their duffs, getting rather nice paychecks and coasting along doing less than the minimum. On the other hand, perhaps they're only making minimum wage these days. That would at least solve the mystery of this show's appalling recent dullness.
0425266060|5.0|I decided to read these 3 after reading the 50 shades trilogy which I enjoyed & figured even if they were similar that's fine considering in one way or another love stories are always similar.  By the time I got to the 2nd book I was hooked. I really can not see how the book is entirely like 50 shades.  These characters are very different and considering in many ways they are equally messed up (Eva & Gideon) in the head from various issues from their childhood it creates a lot of depth that you don't always see in 50 shades.  The sex is mutual & written in a way that you know they both want it as much as the other without hesitation they seem to need each other & lust after one another.<br /><br />One thing you do see is the constant ups & downs which seem to be extreme to the point of frustration. Eva's character can be exhausting and Gideon seems to hide so much that you find yourself waiting through chapters to find the answers to your questions making it a book you can't put down.<br /><br />The last book ending the way it did makes you want more & the fact that I bought it thinking it was a trilogy and yet it isn't is my only complaint because now I have to wait for their story to continue.  I very much look forward to the next book and am now a fan of Sylvia Day.<br /><br />Edited to add: I am now reading this series for the 3rd time in hopes that the 4rth book comes out soon.  This series never get's old and I have never reread any other book like this.  These characters are so well written & after reading so many books after 50 Shades with powerful men, hands down Gideon is the best there is.
B009HEMW4W|2.0|Rambling, unfocussed, pointless third sequel. The first was good the second was &#34;meh&#34; this one's an absolute stinker. Don't bother.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Awesome game it's a must buy game.  Get upgrades and defend the bunker, it's the only way.  Watch out for the juggernauts.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great source of ideas if what you are looking for is inspiration to lead the tranformation of your organization and or your personal life.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Interesting premise, intriguing mythology, but the writing was weak throughout. Some of the description was confusing, the dialogue attributions were often ambiguous, and the &#34;love triangle&#34; is one that's been done to death in other series. Also, the resolution seemed held back/needlessly postponed by a series of &#34;side quest&#34; story lines that could have been shortened or cut completely from the book.<br /><br />I'll give book two a chance, but that's mostly because I both books 1 and 2 when they were on sale for $2.60 each.
6305428042|5.0|It was great! Just like described in the description! My kids ages 12, 9, and 5 really enjoyed this movie!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I loved this book because Mike seems to cut the fancy speak and get straight to the simple facts relative to weight training!
B00D23GXB2|5.0|This is not your mother's poetry... What is contained in this book is in a class by itself. It is not soft-speak sonnets about oceans of time...or innocent love...or coping with old age.<br />Here, you have a collection of intense and seductive poems that pack an all-sensory punch. GPA doesn't just throw words at you, he takes you on a provocative journey and makes the reader a voyeur to some steamy experiences.<br />Although the subject matter is not for the conservative/ repressed...it is still written with class and overflowing with style.<br />My favorite poem...\\"Her Flow\\"...making the analogy that a sexual encounter is like a world-ending apocalypse? Genius!<br /><br />I am not sure if there is much poetry out there in this style. If not, I think GPA is on to something...perhaps he can corner the market of erotic poetry and own it with the skill and finesse he has shown here. A great read that will keep you reading...and sweating.
B00D9RQO56|5.0|Hey it's Sunnydale Chick, And besides The Shining for this Years Halloween movie; This is our other one. The song is the theme for EVERY Halloween of course....(but HEY?) And the movie is just 2 great! Besides BEETLEJUICE and Edward Scissorhands (Hey me, my guy and my friends/family dig the classics.) Plus this year I found The Revamped Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys video version, so YES they're are some fans of our movie out there. And I wanted to talk more about that vid so my review won't sound the same as last year's (even though I didn't make that review on Halloween.....it was more during the summer before they changed the system.....so if you read it cool! But This one's for the vid that goes with it!  BLADE and FLAME THROWER have teeth ground sharp and eyes glowing red.....added with Leech Woman and Jester is one who's waiting for the next surprise! Six Shooter has the fingers like snakes and spiders in my hair line......and then we have the other cool Toulan Puppets As the Halloween town background characters and there's Corey Feldman of course as my FAVORITE Puppet Master; now for those of you readers who've noticed I've been writing about him a lot....there IS a pretty interesting story that goes with it that EVERYONE will hear about soon; but don't worry.....I haven't gone all Kathy Bates in Misery.......(I'm not THAT weird; but I can't tell you the rest of the story yet either.....Just think of the song lyrics.....Everybody's waiting for the next surprise! Cause it's gonna be....pretty cool!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is addictive and super fun. it is a challenging puzzle game that keeps you wanting to play more!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Outstanding product that cleared up storage space in a flash!  I couldn't download movies and kept receiving the storage limitation popup.  Clean Master fixed the problem.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game but wish you didn't need friends from facebook to move through the levels. I don't like to share every move I make. I don't use Facebook often at all.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I've played many hidden object/adventure games and this one is very boring.  Game play was jerky on my gen 1 kindle fire.  When you walk into a room, the next move is blinking at you, no thinking involved.  Also, too many hidden object scenes for my liking, with really no adventure to balance.<br /><br />So, to sum up.  If you love hidden objects, have never played adventure or don't care to explore on your own and want to be baby stepped through the entire game, give it a shot.  Hey, it's free to try even if it did take twenty minutes to download.  As for myself, glad there was a free preview.<br /><br />Did not buy the full version .......deleted!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works well, easy setup, still waiting on more third-party app support, but the product itself is amazing. This is one product everyone should have.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of ho games, but gotta hand it to this one.  It kept my interest because you were allowed to choose the game.  Search by picture, word, shadow, and many other unique to this game.  Give it a try!  You won't be disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product, Google does it again!<br />Very easy to setup and it world flawlessly with YouTube.<br />Roll on more compatible apps!
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|High energy puzzle game.  It worked well on my kindle fire.  The spider is nice and takes turns, but to much stress for me.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the interactive features. Helps me keep up with the weather at a glance. Very inclusive features of the home page. Very easy to use.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|Loved every bit of it. Will recommend to all my friends. Read every book of FF. when will be the next?<br />David Chester
B00992CF6W|5.0|It awesome because you get to play with your friends and just have lots of fun great job mojang :)
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This CD has some of the best songs Blake Shelton has made. I would greatly suggest this CD to everyone.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|Wow!  $100 for virtually everything on disc by Arthur Rubinstein.  I bought many of these when they were first released on CD (not to mention the LPs I owned before that).  Some are recordings I have loved for decades.  Now I have everything I didn't have and all my old CDs can be replaced with remastered versions for about 70 cents a disc!  The box is very well organized, nice book, and the original album covers bring back fond memories of my first hearing some of these gems back in the 1970s.  Very, very highly recommended.
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|A great family movie!  Parts of it were a little scary for the younger ones, but when you watch it before Monsters Inc. it can put things into perspective for them.  A great movie marathon night!
B000FC11JW|5.0|Drucker was fantastically observant and the insights he has drawn are timeless.  Every manager/executive would be well served to read this book and to implement his recommendations.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved the plot. The suspense was so much fun.  I could not put it down. My only complaint was it ended to soon.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I finished this in two days. Leave it to Mr. King to write such a great sequel. If you have read the shining, you have to read this.
0393316041|4.0|Funny, campy book by Feynman is a sort of overview of funny and cute stories from his life. Not a full biography, just random chapters of things Feynman found amusing. Some interesting, lighthearted perspectives of a scientist at the Manhattan project.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love Rick Riordan books I would want movies for the Percy Jackson and the Olympians I like them so much!
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|It is an excellent CD from a young group. You can see the passion in her when one watches the videos.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is gun game to play but when I swipe a curtain way it does it the opposite way . I love the minions they are so cute
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|First of all thank you for making candy crush available for Kindle Fire!!!  Ahhh!  I am so addicted, love it.  The one thing I have noticed though as it has happened more than a few times since downloading is once in a while playback will slow down dramatically and then next thing you know my Kindle restarts.  Frustrating.
0553378384|5.0|I find the book fantastic and very helpful! My North Node is in Scorpio and every detail was dead on.  Also, I find myself going back to it and re-reading certain parts which needed time to sink in...all in all, highly recommended from a person who has no training in astrology!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter loves this game. It is easy to play and she enjoys buying all the pets houses. Glad they updated it since she needed more homes.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|This movie started off really action packed and then just kept on dragging on.  Not worth the money at all.
B00EIL7E9C|5.0|I love this show and missing it so badly right now!! Does anyone know when session 6 will be released?? From what I found it was to be out in June, 2013 and its now November 9 2013 and still not released.... Please if anyone knows when we are able to purchase it for viewing you will make my day! = )<br />I hope session 6 is another great one, as I have heard form other reviews its changed and possibly not as good... fingers crossed and excited to see it again!!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Readers always expect a happy ending at the end of each book, but Roth has chose the exact opposite. To be honest, I don't really think her aim for this book was to make her readers happy. I think it was to show a good moral, and make her readers really think. It worked in fact, for some of us. I ended up thinking about what I would do in the situations Tris was in during the whole series. I eventually realized the true meaning of &#34;Be Brave,&#34; in every book I read, especially this one.<br /><br />  Other than all of the grief we as the readers experienced while reading the book, it was extremely well-written and planned out. Tris sacrificed herself, not just to save Caleb and everyone she loves, but to save everyone who deserved to live. The Declaration of Independence said that a government should not be abolished if the government was restorable. Tris saw this, and immediately took action, pushing herself past her limits, and going where no one would have dared to go. I think it was terrible that Tris died, but it also shows the readers that Being Brave isn't just about facing your fears. It's about Being Brave and sacrificing yourself for those you love, not stopping until you get what is needed. Tris did exactly that.
B004C00EM8|5.0|By reading the synopsis of this movie, do not think for one minute that you will be prepared for the horror of torture. The opening scene of escape is almost too much to bear.<br /><br />Not to give much away, but there is a deceiving display of a happy, normal family, two of which are monsters. There is also what I feel is more like a cult than just the fun of slowly taking the lives of girls. Those who did not participate in the torture, are indeed, monsters themselves.<br /><br />The acting is so superb that I felt as if I was a part of the storyline. The special effects and makeup, horrifyingly convincing. Not a movie that just anyone should watch, so be warned. But be convinced that there has never been a movie like Martyrs.
0307341550|5.0|i'll be reading this book again definitely! i was completely drawn by the plot and the characters. Another great book by Gillian Flynn
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I love this game. It's AWESOME. I can't get off of it. I play all day long. I repeat its AWESOME so AWESOME.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a mesmerizing story.  They are such opposites yet you find yourself pulling for them to find a happy medium.  Also I felt like this was an education for me.  I'm more naive than I realized.
0743454537|3.0|This book is somewhat difficult to rate. I picked it up because I needed something light & easy, a little break from the historical fiction that I usually read. A quick read, yes, but not quite as fluffy as I thought it would be. Anna is the main character in this novel, though each chapter is told from a different person's point of view. She was chosen as an embryo to be placed in her mother's womb because her genetic characteristics matched her sister who was dying of leukemia. From the moment she is born, Anna is required to give to her sister, Kate, in order to keep her alive. It is the only reason Anna exists. When Anna is 13 years old and told she must donate a kidney to her sister, who is most likely going to die anyway, she decides to fight back and sue her parents for medical emancipation.<br /><br />From here, I will break down this novel into it's various qualities that caused me to come up with my rating because it was not a simple 3-star across the board book.<br /><br />4 Star Qualities<br />I cared about Anna. I wasn't sure if she would win her case or if she would end up giving the kidney to Kate anyway, but I felt for this poor girl who was nothing but a vessel holding spare parts to her mother.<br /><br />It was difficult to put down. Despite some of the poor writing, melodrama, and other less loveable aspects of this book, I would have stayed up all night reading it if I didn't have my own family to worry about.<br /><br />3 Star Qualities<br />Obviously, this is where I place most of the book. The style of writing each chapter from a different character's point of view is one that is rarely pleasing. It got particularly confusing when the author would change perspectives in the middle of a scene - sometimes between two characters, such as two male adults, that made it difficult to remember who was 'speaking'.<br /><br />Melodrama - this novel has just a little bit too much. Rather than feeling connected to the characters and like this could happen to me. I had to roll my eyes at times that something else was falling apart. By the end, I wasn't shocked or crying (which I had kind of expected), I just felt like it was an over the top cop-out.<br /><br />Lack of faith. No, this is not a Christian novel, but, since it centers around a child who has been in the process of dying for 14 years, one would think that faith would be a side-note. A few references are made to life after death speculation, but the most profound statement on faith that is made is when Kate says her father (a firefighter) couldn't go to Hell because he would put all the fires out.<br /><br />2 Star Qualities<br />The mom. I guess Sarah Fitzgerald is supposed to be the author's version of a typical mom who ends up dealing with very atypical circumstances. She discovers when Kate is 2 years old that she has a rare form of leukemia. Since Kate's best chance at a greater life expectancy is a related donor for blood, bone marrow, and organs, Sarah decides to have a child to provide for Kate. An embryo is carefully chosen that will be an ideal donor for Kate. No mention is made of the discarded embryos that were not good enough to be given life since they could not be back-up parts for Kate. When Anna is born, Sarah is not joyful over the birth of her daughter; she wonders how long it will take them to get the cord blood to Kate. Her attitude toward poor Anna remains the same throughout the novel. She tries to defend herself saying that, of course, she loves both her daughters and Anna would choose to help Kate, but as soon as Anna does not want to undergo unnecessary surgery to sacrifice more of her body to her dying sister, the mother is angry, appalled, and horrid to everyone around her.<br /><br />The writing style. Besides the point of view switches that include seven different people, this book was riddled with disjointed flashbacks and random thoughts that broke up the scene they interrupted. I also wondered, do that many 13 year olds usethis level of profanity? Maybe I'm being a prude, but I thought this novel would be an interesting read for my 11 & 14 year old except for the sprinkling of f-bombs . . . . oh, and the couple unnecessary sex scenes. I could have done with way less lame service dog jokes as well.<br /><br />The ending. Through this entire novel, we wait to see if Anna will win her case for medical emancipation. Of course, the reader also wonders if she will choose on her own to donate to Kate even if she wins. I think the ending was supposed to be shocking, but I thought it was a lazy, unsatisfying finish.<br /><br />I do think that this book would make a good book club choice because it includes lots of aspects for discussion, but it could have been so much better.this level of profanity?

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Once I started reading...I could not stop and read this book straight through.  What an incredible warrior, husband, father and son.  It should teach everyone some valuable lessons in life: God and family first, live each day like it is your last, treat people with respect and never quit.  Godspeed Adam...
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I have been a fan of Paul McCartney since 1964.  This CD is GREAT!  The music and lyrics are classic Paul. For all the years this awesome artist has been recording music he still ceases to impress me.  BRAVO PAUL.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app is very useful and creative. helps with checklist AND reminders not just notes. u also get to choose how u want it to be set up and what color u want it to be!
B00ECUARO8|2.0|This movie was pretty pointless, painful to watch.  Didn't love the constant cussing, and the message... love doesn't last?  Okay...  This movie is a real lame, long, rather boring movie that I regret wasting any time on.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Really cute game and it does give you gems without purchases, however you need a lot of gems! Really wants you to spend a ton of money on this game. And you need friends who play as well otherwise you cannot complete some items either. And you get nothing from the host friend. Seems you should be able to get something.<br />Otherwise it is cute game really requiring some hand eye coordination for some tasks.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great device, it helps when the kids want to watch tv and you are in another section of your house. No more trying to find a channel or program.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I started to grow board with the games I had on my kindle fire, and I needed a new game to play. When I found this one, I thought &quot;Why not, ill give it a try.&quot; I played for so long, that my kindle went from a full charge to 10% charge in one day. It killed me that I couldn't play it. This game is one of the best city building war games ive played, considering that it is free! I would reccommend this game to my friends, considering I already have! : - )<br />Tip - The mess hall will give you a lot of coins, but you need to have a few and some patience. Took me 2 of them and about 30minutes to get around 1,400.<br /><br />About the game:<br />  In this game, you get to build up your base, which includes; Building buildings, roads, expanding your base, training infantry, land vehicles, air vehicles, and marine vehicles. You get to fight the evil person ( I cant think of the name!) by sending out six of your troops against six of his troops (pay attention to the triangle in the middle of the battle screen, it tells you how each type of troop performed against other types of troops)<br /><br />Hope I helped!<br />-Summondclick
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend since he is massively into sci-fi. He loves how clear the picture is and it arrived in less than 5 days! It is amazing!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|a spellbinder....this was truly a nostalgic walk, having lived through this experience and remembering what an emotional impact it had, not only on me, but on our country.  King is a very good writer, and the descriptions he gave through the book about the area, the slang expressions used at that time, and the dances.....very good!!
B000003TBP|5.0|It was a penny and had no scratches.  it came without a case.  but the quality is fantastic. you rock!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There is a reason why the whole world is playing it. You should too. Some levels are really hard. You can get stuck for days and want to give up.. but that's where the real fun is. Just when you think it's hopeless, you jump that hurdle and you are on to your next quest.......
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|As all the world knows, this gripping series can easily lead to binge viewing. As soon as you think you've figured out what's coming--yikes!--another unsettling twist! The heart and soul of Homeland is the spookily gifted Danes, who clearly gives every moment her all. When her character slips into a psychotic episode, the viewer feels a little unbalanced, too. The fact that Danes' characters motivations are mysterious (what draws her to Brody?) just adds to the fascination. Try not to miss Homeland--try hard.
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|A true classic!  An oldie but a goodie.  When I first saw this movie, I was under 30 years old.  Now, I'm well beyond that.  Why is the future always painted so bleakly???  You'll love this thrillride.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Really like the entry displays each number entered until pressing enter. The skin options are nice. The flip for simple vs additional features is great.  Picked the one after trying several.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has such a beautiful voice and she sings some great numbers.  I enjoy this collection of standards.  You will too.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is very addictive and affordable. That's what I like about games like this. It's a great game, and its FREE. So I recommend you try it.
0739313126|5.0|Dan is simply the Man.  He astounds me with his research details and great storytelling.  An eye-opening thrillride.  It will keep you riveted.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|This is a phenomenal book!  Extraordinary, complex and memorable characters, snappy dialogue, fatal flaws, clever twists, and a brilliant climax. I confess I wasn't expecting much when I picked this up.  I've been disappointed often by other recommendations in the kindle store. I found myself looking forward to having time to read a few chapters throughout the day and, given time, would have happily blazed through it in a single sitting. Very engaging!  This book is absolutely worthy of its five-star reviews.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Simply stunning.  A masterpiece in every sense of the word.  So very deserving of the Academy Awards it received.  Do not let the fact that it is a &#34;silent&#34; keep you from seeing this magnificent picture.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|The problem with this movie is that it is a chick flick disguised as action sci-fi. The movie spends way too much time on falling in love and the study of characters and their motivations. It should really have had more scenes cut during editing to speed it along.
0143038419|2.0|I know it's supposed to be amzing but I read the first chapter and was not drawn in.  In fact, because I did not care for the book, I wouldn't even see the movie.  Sorry.
B00004VXF2|3.0|1.  Music For Nodding Off On Junk<br />2.  Ambient Music for the Crystal Meth Crowd<br />3.  John & Yoko's Honeymoon<br />4.  Revolution No. 999.999<br />5.  Wall of Sound for Torture Chamber<br />6.  Fire Ants In Mind Blood Vessels<br />7.  Velvet Fingernails On Underground Blackboard<br />8.  Heaven/Hell Negotiations<br />9.  Rainbow In Barbed Wire Waterfalls<br />10. Brainwash Listerine<br /><br />Note: If you want to hear something FAR MORE LISTENABLE, try Lou's \\"Metal Machine Trio, The Creation of the Universe.\\"  It's MUCH BETTER.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|One of Taylor's first albumns and one of the best.  It contains some of her biggest hits.  You'll love it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My fiancé and I love this app. We both have insomnia. I was skeptical about this app at first, but it worked wonders! The amount and quality of our sleep has improved exponentially! We use it all the time! We love the option of playing multiple sounds at the same. The individual volume setting for each sound makes it that much better.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|In a word - fabulous!  One of the most beloved tv series of all time.  This is the entire collection.
B004AP9W46|5.0|Does this book even need a review? Mrs. Rice never displeases. Vivid details, deep thought- this book is just as amazing as her others.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Loved this book! Really loved the last chapter. It sums it up well that there is enough and everything is POSSIBLE!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Cute but not as good as I thought it would be.  They didn't sell the premise.  Not horrible, but not great.
B004DSDAE8|4.0|I like the more rubbery feeling ones, but these work. I try to not include feelings in the product, It lost a star because of the fact that putting the cap in is harder than the rubbery one.<br />Its a more firm plastic and washes really well.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|best game i have ever played. i was going to sell my kindle fire but this game kept me from doing that so yea its that good
B009CVRQLY|5.0|All I can say is....GREAT! thank you Celine for some good music and lyrics! At first I was like where are all those big powerful notes....but its time for a change and Celine gives us a new vocal perspective.....just to sing!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|A reasonably good sequel and interesting handling of the Khan Noonien Singh in the now altered timeline of the modern story line.  But this installment falls well short of its predecessor for plot, character, and action sequences IMHO.  I give it the fourth star only in gratitute for keeping the franchise alive.
0316322407|4.0|A wish list gift, so I guess all is good. Good to give what is wanted and see a smile.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I loved this book because it had love and drama and heartbreaking adventure. It's one of the best books I have ever read.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|I got the album before the movie came out and I knew right away I'd like the album. I own several albums by Ramin Djawadi and he has never failed to deliver an entertaining music experience.<br /><br />my favorite tracks on this are track 1, pacific rim and track 18, go big or go extinct. to anyone whose seen the movie, it should be obvious why.
B00CATSONE|2.0|More of an overview, felt like I was reading the cliff notes. Very interesting man, deserves a better and more complete story
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|back when this movie was coming to theatres, digorno had a promotion, 4 pizzas for one free ticket, I actually bought 4 pizzas, printed my ticket, and we went to see this, only to find out all the showings for the entire month were sold out..ended up seeing startrek into darkness instead.<br /><br />so when this came out on dvd, I pounced. I have not regretted it.<br /><br />I cant really say anything else without spoiling it for the rare few who have yet to see this, but I will say you will not be disappointed.
B00BUT5I84|4.0|If anyone should know a thing or two about the dynamics of drama, it would be an actor. Jared Leto and 30 Seconds To Mars pour it one thick with their \\"Love Lust Faith And Dreams.\\" After all, he's one of the very few to cross his acting career with an ongoing successful rock band, and a couple listens to \\"LLF&D\\" prove that Leto takes his musical craft as seriously as he does his acting. Pairing up again with producer and fellow dramatist Steve Lillywhite (U2, among many others) and plow forward.<br /><br />If \\"This Is War\\" found the band edging away from grunge and screaming while turning towards prog rock, \\"Love Lust Faith And Dreams\\" takes it even further. Bubbling synths underscore many of the tracks here, especially the anthems like \\"City of Angels,\\" which you can be excused for comparing the piano here to U2's \\"City of Blinding Lights.\\" Since Jared Leto takes songwriter credit fir every song here, you may find it surprising that he does offer plenty of variety. While there's no Kanye West cameos, the dance beat of \\"The Race\\" heads straight for the dance floor while the final song, \\"Depuis Le D&eacute;but,\\" is more raw and dramatic, building its use of an orchestra until it pops...into a wind-up music box.<br /><br />It's that feeling of diversity that keeps \\"Love Lust Faith And Dreams\\" from congealing into a more generic sound. That's not saying it's great, but I'd rather hear a band that can jump from poppy prog to the mystery of \\"Northern Lights\\" and still keeping their independent sound intact. \\"This Is War\\" is, IMHO, the better album, but LLF&D takes more chances.
B0030A0ZD4|3.0|For a Blu-ray transfer the audio is really bad, I had to add extra Bass to get the music to sound the way is suppose to
B004EYT932|1.0|It might just be me, but I found this book just about unreadable. If the authors could have made this into a page-turning narrative I would have appreciated it. I kept thinking, get on with it, make your points and move on.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Love it !!! this movie goes to show the reality of the Roman people and their traditions a must see for Historians and people who want to learn about truth about the Roman Empire
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is a very well written book. I would not have done things the way the protagonist did them but it was very entertaining and they did a pretty good job of adapting it to a movie. I'm an unusual man, I'm told, because I like a good love story.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics. Very entertaining I find myself addicted to this game amazing game for being free. You must get this game
B005UBNKZG|5.0|The only thing I can say here is that if you buy this processor, you will be happy with your purchase.  I suggest getting a liquid cooling system.  This thing is fast, and it has been very consistent since purchase.  Highly recommended.
B00EZPCZ5O|3.0|I have been a fan of afi, since &#34;veyy proud of ya&#34;. I never really got into them, in the way I have been for 16 years, after the release of shut your mouth and open our eyes, All Hallows ep, and Black sails in the sunset. If your like me, you may want to avoid this one. I really enjoyed the track Make you suffer, and a few more. I have read screamo vocals,and best album since sing the sorrow, lol. Do ou even know what screamo is? Afi is a heavily influenced misfites clone in a sense, ie: Son Of Sam, havok, Members of samhain, and danzig. I know afi is better known for tor their radio albums now, and that is great. PEOPLE got to eat, and bands this talented should be on the radio. This album doesn't hold a torch to bsitsunset, AH ep, December, Ihavoice, or stsorrow. Save our cash, or at least preview the songs. P.S. I am refering to the punk years, when AFI, was breaking records for an underground punk band.
1612680011|5.0|I loved this book because it awakened my love for finance and real estate!<br />The comparisons between the dads is so stark that it makes the concepts very clear.<br />I also liked the diagrams, they bring the concepts to life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy the game it's one of the best games of all time. It is currently is my favorite game and totally worth the money
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Watch it with open mind when you have time to kill. Its not a five star movie but it isn't a one star movie either!
0399250395|3.0|I received this as a gift when son turned 1, i waited until he was almost 3 to read this version to him.  He loves the pop up and it is pretty but its REALLY fragile.  We only read it together and he was very careful with the moving parts but 2 pop-ups broke in less than 5 readings with very normal use.  You cant tell a child that they can't touch their books.  He does still let me read it and he tries hard not to touch it but its not very enjoyable that way.  I don't recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy its on kindle. i love being able to take a break and read. It is easy to use and connects well.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game makes the player think and remember. It is fun to play, providing personal satisfaction each time you enter the elevator!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I believe this game may be challenging for some, but not enough for me. It was too short, also. What little bit there is was fun though.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Great idea terrible execution.  Except for netflix its worthless so far.  The opportunity is there for it to be great but they are letting it go by not utilizing the full potential.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|interesting enough game. story line not bad. good graphics. curious to see where story leads. eats up too much money!!
B001F6TXME|4.0|Pros:  Helpful for astrophotography, as you can take pictures without bumping the camera. Also has a setting to hold down the shutter for as long as you want.<br />Cons:  Wish the cord were longer...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Not one complaint against the game .  The best part is it's free .WOW this game is really good. THE BEST way possible.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It is a great  game it is<br />cool that you can upgrade your guns so you get better range and that you get to kill wolves and that they get to attack you
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I don't want to give too much away. Basically the title of this review says it all. I can't fault it for anything. One hell of a thrilling ride.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don t like it and it dose nt feel like a fun game to play I don t like the 14 th level its hard
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent just excellent it could have better features but in the end and most of the time is the only thing you are going need to stream your favorites shows
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love the way  the puzzles are mixed in with the hidden item scenes as well as trying to figure out the mystery. Such a fun and intriguing game. Would purchase other games like this.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card is quite the writer! He keeps his characters true to themselves even when you don't think it's so. I really enjoyed this set...ordering it because the movie was about to hit the theaters. I have since ordered and read almost all of the &#34;Ender&#34; related books. I am a fan of Orsons, however, I am not a fan of the movie! Perhaps they'll consult more with the author on the next one.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I love this movie - the characters made me laugh and cry.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch old movies.
B00351ZUHY|5.0|Never gets old watching it!  Now im watching the following, hes just as great today! I highly recomend it !
B00D5TASN2|4.0|Good album, but I think I liked Crazy Clown Time better. The songs in Crazy Clown Time were much more visual.
006202406X|4.0|Was good and kept you wondering what would happen next, then I thought the ending was the worst part of the whole trilogy. Hated the last quarter of the book.
B00E6895M6|4.0|Really good debut album... Great band live too! I've been waiting for it since seeing them at Sasquatch in May.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|started playing 2days ago like the way the game plays and the graphics are great. like that you get to hunt a number of different types of animals
B009GEEMLY|2.0|Boring movie. All special effects and no substance. This movie convinced me not to waste my time watching future Marvel movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A Time To Kill is still one of my favorite Grisham titles, and this was a commendable tie in to that setting and many of the original characters.  The new characters were also interesting.  It wasn't much of a mystery, but I don't think it was shooting for that goal. It was a simple, somewhat unreal, feel good story with the typical Grisham skill of building interest as it progressed.  Grisham always leaves a number of loose ends in his books, but that's acceptable.  He is often better at taking off and climbing high than he is in landing the plane.  Like a parable, the main point of this story comes through with clarity and emotion.  I enjoyed it.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|If you watched the other movies then you'll tolerate this movie and maybe even enjoy some parts. If you haven't seen the other movies then don't bother with this one. All in all this series lost its magic after the first one. Like the Matrix I try and pretend the sequels never happened
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was another wonderful book by John Grisham! I recommend this book and all his books to anyone who likes to read. I can't wait for his next book!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|this was my favourite application on ipad, but does not work on kindle fire hdx 7.  The problem needs to be rectified. This could be one reason for me returning my kindle fire hdx.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|From the very beginning to end of the book an incredible development of characters and their stories. A must read for anyone that likes mysteries.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I'm not much of a gamer, and I only picked this up because it was free.  I found it to be more frustrating than anything - in order to &#34;win&#34; some of the stages, it seems like one would have to buy the &#34;power-ups&#34; for actual cash. Boo! Hiss!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Okay, so when I first got this game, I thought &quot;Cure the Plague&quot; was the idea. Oh, how wrong I was! No, you're not trying to cure the plague and save humanity; you *are* the plague and you're trying to *eliminate* humanity.<br /><br />Okay, so once you've gotten past that admittedly creepy concept, this game is amazingly fun. I've only played it for a few days now, but it is amazingly fun to play (and to try to eliminate everyone). Perhaps it'll get boring as you play repeatedly, but as of this time, it is wonderfully entertaining to play.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|great Stephen King fan always.  This book was really exciting and moving.  My greatest fear was that Dan/Danny would die; if that had happened I would have never forgiven Stephen King.  Looking forward to his next book.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I'm now reading the books since I've finished watching all of the first two seasons of Game of Thrones.  I've read several of the reviews of this Kindle series and see a lot of gripes about this or that issue.  I don't know.  Maybe they're right.  All I can say is I'm having a good time reading them and, because of them, am even more impressed with what the television series has accomplished than I was before.  As far as I'm concerned, the books are great.  Should I run into any issues, I will come back and make note of it, but so far, all is going well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Im like stuck to this game I love it.My family loves it heck everyone does you need to play it
B00AREIAI8|3.0|my horse can be My horse fun but your always having to do a bunch of things before competing which can tend to be annoying.
1400032717|3.0|Great/quick shipping!!<br /><br />Book content .... it was for my daughters summer reading for 2013 (10th grade) and she had a really hard time keeping the story line straight.  She did finally get it together but it sounds like parts are very fragmented, there is a lot going on in the book.  In the end she said it was OK.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I loved this movie, and this play, and this BluRay.  It was exactly what I wanted when I got it!!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|It's a big help to clean the caches. It's easy to use too. I think it's.  Must have application for your kindle fire
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is an awesome game with lots of layouts and backgrounds.  Lots of fun.  Even my nine year old likes it.
B0034JV5YO|5.0|Of course you know that the piano did not exist in Bach's time. Richard Galliano performs a selection of suites, partitas, and concertos with balance and control.  The chromatic accordion is gradually taking its place as a principal classical instrument. Particularly, Galliano's Victoria accordion sings brilliantly and in balanced harmony with the other instruments in the ensemble.
B00GB0R8ZI|5.0|This is what I call a real artist. This young man from Spain has the most beatiful songs, its like they get straight to the heart and make you feel each word, each melody. Alboran is unique.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Unable to read any information with this screen size and resolution. Works fine on my iPad 4, but I want to replace that with this.<br /><br />Needs work to be playable.
B00902AKK4|1.0|Android only and very kidish. i would not get it again, even if it was free.<br />i got it for free
B00FFHG6KQ|1.0|it won't download properly to my Kindle Fire. The worst download I have had to deal with. How do I get it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Super fun ,very addictive, lots of levels,very challenging. Graphics are good. My eight year old likes to play it to, of course she stopped when it started to get challenging.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story dragged on and on, and that is the only \\"nice\\" thing I can say about it. The sheer evil of the two psychotic main characters was way too much for me. The author uses lots of profanity and sexually crude vocabulary and this seemed a bit over the top. Hated the ending; left me thinking there would a sequel to Gone Girl, which I definitely won't be reading. Couldn't wait to be finished with this story and go hug little puppies and sing Baby Beluga to get the horrible taste out of my mouth.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|I have seen some lame movies, but this has to be the worst trash Hollywood has spit out.  The profound unrealistic scenarios is pathetic, one after the other.  Toss in the cheesy Hollywood one liners and lame explosions.  I was really ready for it to be over.  This movie really makes the dedicated agencies that keep us and the President safe look bad.  We got this for a rental at Redbox for $1.50, please don't buy it, you will feel ripped off.  If you want a solid adventure about the White House read Vince Flynn's \\"Term Limits.\\"  Stay away from this unless you are under 15 years old.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|This is one of those movies that is the perfect if you've seen Fight Club or not. And that's a bit of a spoiler. The acting is out of control wonderful. The ending is twisted as in a twist that is off the chain.
B00F031X62|3.0|I'm a long time JH fan and have many releases.  This one really did not bring anything new to the table.  Now, it is Jimi tearing it up as always.  I just did not hear anything new on this material.  I know hard core fans like me will buy it, how could you not.  It's good for a solid jam.  I want another Winterland Box set, now that was awesome.  Jam on.
B003G4W49C|5.0|\\"Pathfinder\\" was my first book I've read by Orson and loved it! So I had little doubt that i would also love \\"Enders game\\".<br />Fast past, exciting from start to stop, could hardly put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad to see that Candy Crush has returned and I'm now able to play on my Kindle!!!! Love it!!
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|the puck seems to gain speed every time it touched something, sending it easily out of control, kindof like in Pinball when it zooms off the obstacles. Puck moves too fast for the playing field size, making it easy to score on yourself. (trust me, the &quot;computer&quot; did it just as often as I did)<br />uninstalled. just not up to standards.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game! Lots of Fun! Easy to lose track of time playing. Challenging and good for exercising the mind. Patience while searching for items helps.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|more options than other LiBii games. however, not worth buying the full version. needs more dress options (even the locked ones)
B004KPLVV8|5.0|Did you know this movie was not nominated for an academy awards because of its use of computer graphics the people who voted thought that the computer was cheating...<br /><br />but I mean they did cheat...<br /><br />and made an AWESOME MOVIE
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome!!! I love it!!! A lot i recommend this to anyone who likes temple run and temple run 2 also subway surfers
B0038ZITIE|5.0|I mean why would you not love this movie...I mean seriously...<br /><br />they should do a sequel to this movie where flash is a grandfather and bla bla bla
B0026IUXO2|4.0|A compelling story of fact and fiction but nicely done. One would have to know the background and saga of Henry VIII, the Reformation, and the establishment of the Church of England, to understand the beginning of the film, and the implications of Catholics vs. Protestants throughout the movie.  But the costumes, the English culture, the revelation of the power of the Catholic church--whether true to not, is fascinating and worth watching.  It is hard to believe what one person will do to another in the name of God, which Shekar Kapur brings out in the film.  Cate Blanchett is an excellent actor and fairs well among a very fine cast, under a very gifted director, Shekhar Kapur. I especially enjoyed Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attenborough. When it comes to acting, one must admit that the Brits are exceptional.  Historians will criticize the film for the fiction, which will be enjoyed by the movie enthusiast that wants to watch a movie filled with drama and intrigue.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Ads are a bit intrusive but easy to get rid of.  Once you start the game they do not interrupt.  Fun  rendition of an old favorite.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Sturdy backpack that my son uses for school. It fits everything, so much so you can barely carry it, it's so heavy! Fits all his books, notebooks and laptop computer in its own school-provided-case. Even fits a change of clothes in the open pocket. The hard case is a good size and a nice to have to carry something more fragile. Very happy with this bag, after 2 months of rugged terrain, it still looks new.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I love history, and this kind of book is a fun way me to arm about it. However, if Fall of Giants put you on the front row of the WW, with great characters, Winter ... Lacks the character building and history thread. It is not as bad as a disappointment, but I definitely expected a Fall ... During WWII. It's not up to the mark.
B003G4W49C|5.0|There are few books that I've read that I wanted to read again. This book is one of those very few. It's not entirely original or shocking. As you read it, you feel like you've been there before. You know the characters. You know the plot. You even know the ending. But, as much as you know it doesn't detract from the book at all. It's like putting on your favorite hiking boots and going on the best, most exciting, hardest, most dangerous, journey you've ever made. It's just you doing what you've always done, one step at a time, but for once it actually means something. It's as if each of us really does matter. I don't know why or how. I haven't figured it out but somehow this story validates my story. My battles & triumphs weren't in vain, yours were not in vain, we all matter. I have no idea how showing that someone is entirely alone in the universe at the same time shows how much they aren't alone at all. But, I have a feeling that  this is similar to Buddhist emptiness. Being connected to nothing is actually being connected to everything.<br /><br />Also, having never read the story the introduction didn't seem meaningful. After reading the book the introduction makes perfect sense. I get it now! Thank you for telling the story for all of us. Each and everyone of us is Ender and each and everyone of us matters. Funny how I didn't know how fundamentally important to me that is.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1.0|It was all good loved everything on the game until I realized I was in a downgraded version and can't update the newer version has way better graphics and the wrecks in cars actually get damaged UPDATE ASAP
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play Bingo Blitz daily and love it. I even got my mom and sister hooked. It used to freeze a lot but is much better now. Can be frustrating at times trying to get the &quot;hard to gets&quot; in each room. The higher the level you reach, the harder it gets. I have been playing for over a year now and still enjoy it. Thank you Bingo Blitz.
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|The action moved a little slow for my taste. I enjoyed the special affects and being able to see it in 3D was very nice.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best thing ever!! Simple, useful, watch my chrome tabs and youtube on tv!! And for the price it is worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing app for people of all ages! It has great graphics and is very addicting. I give this a ten out of ten and totally recommend it! Have fun minions!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There needs to be more apps that works with the Chromecast. But it works perfectly with the few apps that is supported.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best-selling  and I love how it  upgrade every holiday have even a story a note sud way subway surfers email me at ngrecia24@gmail.com
B008J05EL8|1.0|Well, you won't allow me to give it a zero, so this is the next best rating.  So far I have been unable to get it to do anything.  If anyone else has, I'd love to hear about it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was soooo good!! The wedding was beautiful and I can't believe they had kids. Such a great trilogy after reading I definitely wish I had her life lol.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved reading it. A sad but very touching story of various people whose paths cross. Very well written by KH
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book I was hooked in chapter one lol. Crazy Christian but I love him haha I wish he was real!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Blood, gore, and frequent mention of Jupiter's gentlemen sausage. This is a great show that only cable TV can provide. Excellent acting from the entire cast, including Lucy Lawless (who finally lets it all hang out). Zena as you have never seen her before and rocking the Roman world. My only regret is that Andy couldn't beat cancer and I get slightly depressed watching the show now. But hey, if you are going to leave a legacy behind, then Mr Whitfield left a good one. May the fields of Elysium be ever green for you.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|It was cute an full of laughs recommend for the young and old! Truly great read to bring out the crazy cat lady/sir in you!
B00DNDR29I|4.0|I love Janelle Monae. This is yet another spectacular album from her. Appearances by others like Prince are well done and don't seem like gimmicks.
006202406X|3.0|Ugh.  I really wanted to see Tris and Tobias create a new hopeful society together.  Reality is where this happens.  I want hope & change in my fiction. We don't get those too often in life.
B00902AKK4|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played in a while. It has the right amount of challenge to keep me coming back. And the graphics are beautiful. Very glad I got it.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This movie and soundtrack are probably my wife's all time favorite. She randomly sings tunes from it anytime, so I got the movie and soundtrack as a surprise Birthday present for her, she loved it!
B008JFUS28|5.0|I never buy blu-rays but I just realized I have to buy this one because Tom Hiddleston is doing commentary :( Damn you, marketing ploy for working like a charm!!
B008OOYALE|3.0|Great, but it needs an email sign in. I had to reset my kindle and lost everything. other than that it's eepic.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I'm just really impressed with the quality, design and  performance.  I'm astonished that I'm even impressed with a calculator in the first place. Nice job.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Good movie, bought this for my Mother-in-law, she's a trekkie and loves the new version. Can't beat the blu ray quality.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was a terrible book.  Completely ruined the whole series for me, and now I have no desire to see the movies.  Though I have to believe that the producers of the movies will change the ending...if they even get to the last one.  Just terrible....but this lady said it best  http://www.amazon.com/review/RVGSXH2E1HAHQ/ref=cm_cd_pg_pg4?ie=UTF8&asin=B00BD99JMW&cdForum=Fx1457RJURD06FR&cdPage=4&cdThread=TxC2A11OEBXT8D&store=digital-text#wasThisHelpful
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Loved this show!  I missed this episode somehow and had to catch up.  I might have to buy the whole season.
0385537131|5.0|I have read every book by John Grisham and Sycamore Row did not disappoint! He has such a knack for keeping the reader enthralled to the point that you do not want to put the book down. Sycamore Row could have gone either way and in the end everyone was happy (I hope). Mr. Grisham: please write faster, I can't wait for the next book!
006202406X|2.0|I was so excited to get this book. I had been waiting over a year for the final book in the Divergent series; I absolutely loved both of the first books. However, Allegiant was a complete let-down. I was so excited for the movie too, but due to the ending of Allegiant, I think the movie may be ruined.<br /><br />1. The dual perspectives didn't work. I, like many others stated, found myself forgetting which from character's point of view a particular chapter written. Like someone else said, I understand why the author needed to write this book that way, but it just wasn't done well.<br /><br />2. Tris and Four's relationship drama seemed very immature considering all the events they experienced together. First Tris is mad at Four, then she's not, then she's mad again, then she's not, etc. There was no depth. Also, the detailed descriptions of their \\"make-out\\" sessions were redundant and too frequent.<br /><br />3. Like other people said, the conflict resolution with Evelyn and Marcus was anticlimatic. They both just rolled over and everyone else seemed to return their trust immediately. That's kind of an insult to all the characters who died.<br /><br />4. This is minor, but I found it kind of odd that the author made a point to let the readers know two of the characters were homosexual, yet this was not developed at all. It was set up as though it was a significant revelation, yet nothing ever happened.<br /><br />5. Finally, the ending. Really? REALLY? Someone else said they felt dead, depressed, and empty after finishing the book and that's exactly how I felt. The main character dies, everyone returns to a city that's not much better than it was in the beginning, Four is still grieving the loss of Tris, the end. I was going to donate this book to the local middle school library, which is what I did with the first two books. I feel like donating Allegiant would be like donating broken toys to Goodwill.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive and frustrating at the same time.  You'll clear one level the first time you play it then you'll have a level you get stuck on for days.  I find myself saying, &quot;one more try....&quot;
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Grabs you at the first page. Although fictional, it reads as a true story-as if author was given gift to tell it. Would make a great movie!
0307712508|5.0|I loved this book so much that I bought another copy for my step daughter, a nurse.  I loved the portrayal of Henrietta Lacks and her fascinating family.  Some of the medical references were over my head, but mostly it was written for people  that aren't medical professionals can follow it.  A wonderful book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 7 year old thought the game was fun and kind of challenging. Level ten was the hardest. she  went through the game in a couple of days.  The game kept her well entertained.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I think it would be a great read for a teen boy.It wasn't the type of book I was expecting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this series. While others may label it as &#34;mommy porn&#34; I see it for more than that. While there are some graphic scenes, there is a truly deep and complex story line. I am so in love with this trilogy, I read it 3 times!
B005F3XV62|4.0|A creative & fun movie.  I've watched it several times, & it ALWAYS manages to make me laugh & sing...
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|My son really enjoyed this movie. It is probably not one that we will watch often but it is cute. We were really eager to see it as we love the Shrek movies. The plot was not what I expected but it was not bad.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for the kindle version to come out &amp; have not been disappointed!  The colors are great and &amp; clear
B008WCP2KG|3.0|After hereing all of the hype around this movie, I figured I would buy and see what everyone was talking about. While the movie has a very impressive cast list including Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum, I felt that the plot was lacking. I did not mind the movie but it is not one that I will go back to. It really pains me to say that because I had very high hopes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The graphics are great  and the game is constantly updated, so you never get bored.  I highly recommend this game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the final book in the fifty shades trilogy. If you have not read this trilogy, you are missing out! I really enjoyed the first two books, however this one left something to be desired. The story seemed to really rush by as if E. L. James was trying to fit too much into the story and just wanted to finish.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|this is the best pool game I have come across in a while awesome game play and graphics no issues on my kindle fire
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must read for women who enjoy a good romance. While there are some scenes that will make even the more daring blush, there is an amazing story line. Alot of people complain about the writing and how it is &#34;mommy porn&#34; but if you look at the popularity, the numbers speak for themselves. Now I am not saying that the writing is amazing but I can look past that. I really enjoyed this trilogy!
1607066017|1.0|I'm seriously baffled by the fact that so many people like this book.  After hearing multiple recommendations for this story, I was so thoroughly disappointed by it.  It was disgusting and disturbing, and I was tempted to close the book and stop reading numerous times.  I told myself, &#34;Stick it out.  It has to get better.  Why else would so many people like this book?&#34;  But it never did get better, and there is zero chance of me picking up Volume 2.  The writer wants us to jump into the story and accept the world that he is creating, but there is little to no explanation as to what is going on.  I understand that science fiction and fantasy elements are being combined in this story, but I needed more explanation concerning the two main races and why they hate each other so much.  On top of the story lacking, I was disgusted by much of the graphic imagery in the pages of this comic book.  Thinking back on it, I honestly should have stopped reading.  I don't know why I finished it.<br /><br />I want to end this review on a positive note, so, with the understanding that I am in no way recommending this book, I will say that I liked that the narrator of the story is the future version of the baby that was born in the first chapter, telling us the story as she looks back on her family's experiences.<br /><br />I would be very interested to hear from someone that is a fan of this book.  Why?  Please be specific.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|My fiance loves this band, however we could not find any CD's in our area. This was a great Christmas present for him.
144234430X|4.0|Spoilers:  This is a book about time travel, and yet it's not.  Although I wanted to read this because of its ties to the JFK assassination, I soon became more interested in Jake's integration into Jodie society.  I also enjoyed the development of the love story between &#34;George&#34; and Sadie, and found myself preferring to hear about their relationship and Jake's time as a teacher more than the details about him stalking Lee Harvey Oswald.  Of the 6 parts the book was broken into, it was Part 5 which was titled, &#34;11/22/63.&#34;  I think it is telling that the title of the book is also the title of Part 5.  This book really isn't about the day that Kennedy was murdered.  Rather, that tragedy is simply the catalyst to get our protagonist on his hero's journey.  I enjoyed Part 6: The Green Card Man, and was caught up in the thought-provoking, dystopian future.  I had predicted early in the book that JFK being saved would actually lead to more war and hopelessness in the future, and that is exactly what happened.  It made me think about the fact that, perhaps, everything does happen for a reason.  Everything is important.  With this in mind, I liked the way that King portrayed the past as being obdurate.  It doesn't want to be changed.  Because I want people in love to be able to be together, I felt sad at the end of the book.  I wanted Jake and Sadie to be together, and the fact that he had to sacrifice their love for the greater good saddened me.  It is interesting that I feel this way because one of the times I reacted the strongest during the book was after Sadie was shot and<br />Jake revealed that he would go back to 2011, reset time, and go back to 1958 to start over again.  After experiencing everything with him between 1958 and 1963, I reacted so strongly because I didn't want him to go through it all again.  Even at the expense of Sadie.  He had accomplished his mission, and I wanted him to stop while he was ahead.  When we learned from the Green CardMan that there were many time strings (possibly parallel dimensions), I was excited to potentially learn more about their relationship to one another and who the Card Men were.  We never got this, but maybe we will in a future book.
B00FAX6XQC|2.0|It has good graphics, but &quot;checking for updates&quot; is annoying and take from 10 to 20 minutes. Also, it glitches up WiFi and is a very big app and will take a while to download. But, I do recommend this app as this might just be my problem.
1401235166|3.0|Spoilers:  To be fair, it has been over a year since I read my last Fables story, but this was hard to get into.  I didn't really care which cub was chosen to be the new king, and Bufkin's story as an unlikely hero isn't working as well as the transition for Fly and Jack.  Also, where is Ghost?  Why was he not mentioned in this story?  And what's up with Rose Red's new story?  It feels like Willingham is really stretching to make her more important than she needs to be.  She already has a vital role...why mess with that?  The most intriguing parts of this book were the prophecy poem about what would happen to each of the cubs, and the potential that there is for the characters Leigh Duglas and Mr. Holt. I also liked the tale about the sorcerer, Abra Kadabara, although I haven't read the second volume of Cinderella yet, so I think I received a minor spoiler through the telling of his story.  Overall, this volume was not bad, but not great.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Excellent movie , full of intrigue and suspense.  Hitchcock was ground breaking !!! You cant go wrong with this one. I love older movies. They tend to work harder on a good story line rather than a bunch of skin and blood scenes.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|It's a good movie plenty of action and yes I would watch it again. I would also recommend this movie to my family and friends.
B0054S6N04|3.0|This is one of her weaker books; mostly predictable with shorts bursts of pure unbelievability.  Not worth taking the time to finish it<br />Some of her other books have more depth, more developed characters; even a plot.  Invest your time in them instead
B007UXSKMU|5.0|This is a very good movie right up-to-date, yes I could see it again I would recommend this to my children well they are adults.
0812993292|5.0|A stand-out, along with so many fiction books coming out of Great Britain in the past few years.  The Unlikely Pilgrimage continues to stand out in my mind as an unlikely morality play.  My large bookclub almost unanimously agreed that it was a very special book.  It will be on my highly recommended list for a long time!
B002DEZXOE|5.0|It's a shame I didn't go to this I was invited everything. The movie is very good. Lots of great groups played there.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Extremely fun and challenging.  The combination of challenging puzzles provides hours of entertainment and keeps me playing.  Thanks for this fun and highly addictive game.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|This is the best music I have ever heard. It rocks! I can't think of another CD that has this many excellent tracks. This is an instant classic. Keep writing guys.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app.  It was quick and easy.  Cleaned up quite a bit of space on my kindle fire.  I would recommend it.
B00F91H15W|1.0|The movie is boring and vapid. At this point, I can only assume that director is famous because of her father. I wish I could have my money back!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works as it should. Install was easy. Only problem was when ATT replaced my router and I had to &#34;Passcode&#34; two cell phones, two computers, a netbook, a tablet, two kindles the AppleTV, and the chromecast device. Only problem now is learning how to use the Chromecast effectively.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Incredible app. First of all its free it isn't as good a program as Rosetta Stone but again it's FREE. You can learn a language in sort of a game like scenario. The only two downfalls I have found so far are grammar and in game they capitalize the first word of the the fill in the blank so it automatically gives you the first word. Other than that have no complaints. I love it.
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|so far it works better than any video player i got before. it's played files i never thought i'd see. AWESOME!!!
B00594XOZU|1.0|ITS SO ANNOYING AND IT  DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT THIS APP IS ON THE AMAZON APP MARKET IF THE APP DOESN'T WORK !!!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|At first I thought this was the greatest invention I had seen in a long time.  The awesomeness soon wore off as I realized that Google has gone to great lengths to limit what this can be used for!  Because of their mental Apple-like control of software and content I can't even stream a movie clip of my kids I made with my camcorder!!!  So close yet still so far from perfect.  Too bad these big companies are control freaks!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A good puzzle app that I can play a few levels, and go back to  and improve a prior score as I choose.  Increasing difficulty.  Can mute just music, or also FX.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|It doesn't work. I'm so disappointed. If anyone can suggest a bottle cutter that works, please let me know.  Would really like to make gifts for the holiday.
0060245867|5.0|My family loves this book!  We have several others in the series, all equally popular.  Very attractive price also.  Bravo!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I was expecting this book to be an amusing bit of fluff. It was far more than that. Megan and Conner are both wounded souls who have done a remarkable job of pulling a life together out of the chaos of their childhoods. When they meet one night in Las Vegas, sparks fly to the extent that they find themselves married the next morning, along with the usual hangover.<br /><br />This book is the work of a skilled writer and it is also well edited. I liked the length -- not too long and not too short. Both of the lead characters are likable,and the love scenes are well done without being overdone.<br /><br />This one is easy to give a Recommended rating.
0143119680|1.0|I couldn't finish A Discovery of Witches, which I'd purchased because I'd seen so many positive reviews. It comes down to how much of a romantic you are. In other words, if you don't care if the characters' behaviors make sense in any known scheme of human endeavour and you are into vampires, then you'll probably like this book.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Just wow! I never expected any of that game of thrones is written leaving so much suspense I have to pick up then next book....now.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|First off: Spoilers. There will be lots in here. Well actually, only one, which is really what it all comes down to, and which, I suspect, is going to make this series both notorious and wildly successful for the foreseeable future. And btw, I gave this 2 rather than 1 star because it kept me reading till the disastrous ending, which must mean something. But anyway, about *that* ending:<br /><br />First of all, I don't call the ending disastrous because it's tragic. There are novels with devastating endings built on tragic love stories that I've nevertheless loved - \\"At Swim, Two Boys\\" and \\"As Meat Loves Salt\\" come immediately to mind. Or in the YA realm: \\"The Book Thief\\" or \\"The Sweet Far Thing\\" or \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" Yet while I loved all of those books, I hated \\"Allegiant\\", to the point - two stars not withstanding - where I wish I'd never read it.<br /><br />As a writer, that's something I don't say lightly; in fact I don't think I've ever said it at all, about any book. And the thing is, I don't hate it because Tris died. I get the Christ analogy. I get that sacrificing herself to save everyone she loves is the obvious culmination of being both Abnegation and Dauntless. Thematically it makes perfect sense, and executed differently, it might have made a poignant ending, rather than one that made me wish I could scrape it out of my head. What it killed it for me is that the story wasn't strong enough support the death of the main character, and in so many ways that there really isn't any room for equivocation.<br /><br />To begin with, the plot was riddled with holes. For instance (and ignoring the most ridiculous ones) what good is it going to do to 'reset' this one facility to forget their prejudices and save the memories of another small group of people, when there's no evidence that the rest of the world isn't working on the same prejudiced principles, doing the same thing? None of the kids plotting the insurrection have been any further than the GP facility. What do they really know? And then, who exactly is left in Chicago for the reader to care about, once the main characters have left? If Tobias had been left behind, and was in danger of being reset or killed or whatever, then I could have begun to understand Tris's choice. But condemning him to grief and misery because It's The Right Thing To Do and My Brother's Doing It For the Wrong Reasons? It doesn't wash.<br /><br />Speaking of characters: none of the supporting cast is particularly well fleshed out, and as a result I didn't really care about any of them. The relationship between Tris and Tobias was the reason I kept reading. So take that away, and yes, it feels like a betrayal. In fact I'm guessing this is the root of most of the vitriol over this ending - not that Tris died, per se, but that the reader isn't left with anything redeeming to look to, any bright spot amidst the loss. All we get is a Tobias more broken than he was already, and a society that's miraculously healed within two years of its extremely virulent problems. And that's a pretty paltry offering when you've invested nearly 2000 pages in a love story.<br /><br />I also resented the gap between the gain and the enormity of Tris's sacrifice (never mind that she was doing to one group of people exactly what they'd planned to do to another.) Maybe the future of humanity did depend on 'resetting' the scientists, but if so, the evidence eluded me. It read as if Tris died for the dubious honor of re-educating a building full of bigots, and for the love of her wishy-washy brother who tried to kill her. Why? What about her love for Tobias, and his for her? What about his brokenness, and how much he needed her to be whole? And then, there's a whole world beyond the research complex that she knew nothing about, except by hearsay, and that, therefore, could easily have undone what she died for the next day. It all left me mentally screaming: 'Whyyyyyy?'<br /><br />But the deal-breaker for me comes notin the writer-analysis, but in the mommy-analysis. I have an 11-year-old daughter who is a very precocious reader. And while I generally don't censor what she reads - 'The Book Thief' and 'The Mortal Instruments' and 'Ender's Game' are some recents - I would never give her this book, for the simple reason that the main and most identifiable female character, who is otherwise actually a pretty decent role model for young girls, dies to save someone who really doesn't deserve it. Liberal commie-mommy that I am, I can't bear to propagate the attitude that women's primary value is in giving to others at the expense of themselves. Yes, selflessness is admirable, and necessary if we aren't all going to sink back into the Cosmic Soup. But angsty, dramatic, half-baked heroics? Spare me.

B000JLK5NW|4.0|It fit my needs. Saved me from having to buy a new tripod for fit.<br />Would have given 5 Star.<br />But I think the price is high. Thinking $4.00 to $7.00 dollar would be a better price range.<br />But when you need something, you have to pay the price.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My husband and I really enjoy this game AND so does our 4 yr old! Mommy does wish there was a more small kid friendly version!!!! Hint hint
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Spent every spare minute of the day reading this until I was done.  A story about a dystopian society in a credible and intricate setting.  It has everything.  A touch of science fiction, drama, action, mystery, and of course love.  If you are interested in any of these you will enjoy this book.  If you enjoy all of these you will love this book.  Only minor negative was that some of the character development was a bit weak.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed looking for the clues.  It was challenging, but not too challenging.  There were a couple of occasions I would have liked a hint.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the talk I heard about this book I decided to check it out. I tried but I couldn't finish reading this book because the girl in this book sounds like a teenager instead of a grown woman & the storyline is not capturing my interest.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Lots of fun and quite addictive.  Despite what people say, you can play and not pay, you just need to be patient.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|this is a good read so long as you want a fairy tale romance. Nicholas Sparks really knows how to bring a woman's dream guy come to life
B005LAIII0|5.0|This is a beautiful story.  Make sure you watch the special effects and how the movie was made after you watch it.  Then you will want to watch it again.  Don't watch the special effects feature first, though, so you don't spoil the awesome nature of the film the first time you see it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Simple, easy format.  Great tool for learning. I feel like ive learned more in three days than i learned in a whole semester of high school.

B006AN78XS|5.0|This movie is the story of Gil (Owen Wilson), a bored screenwriter living in California in a state of unrest about the possibility that he could become a distinguished novelist.  He simultaneously has become aware of the many writers and artists who have established their style and credibility during stays in Paris.  Dreaming of doing the same, he falls in love with Paris and with the idea that he must see Paris in the rain.  Eventually, he convinces his attractive but skeptical fianc&eacute;e Inez (Rachel McAdams) that he must go there with her and make a highly focused effort to become an established novelist.  They arrive and soon her Father (Kurt Fuller) and mother (Mimi Kennedy) arrive on one of her father's business trips.  During a dinner in Paris scheduled for sensitive, open-minded and creative Gil and her parents to get to know each other, it becomes obvious that her wealthy, conservative and fixed-belief parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy) clash with Gil on almost every topic that comes up.  Early on, the most sensitive viewers are almost sure to notice that in some ways, Inez is like her parents and might not be an ideal match for Gil.  After getting settled in Paris, Inez encounters friends Paul (Michael Sheen), a pedantic know-it-all who talks almost continually and Carol (Nina Arianda).  Paul and Carol invite Gil and Inez to go dancing.  Inez accepts but Gil declines.  He wants to walk the streets of Paris at night to start soaking up the atmosphere he thinks might help him find himself as a distinguished novelist.  As a Paris clock loudly chimes the hour of midnight, a large and ancient taxi drives up to Gil and an animated and happy group of drinkers invite him inside.  The taxi drops Gil and his new friends at a lively party where he realizes he has passed through a time warp and is in the presence of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and many other celebrities alive and well in the 1920s.  Gil revels in his good fortune and thinks the 1920s is the golden era he would most want to live in.  He meets and falls in love with the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who has just broken up with Pablo Picasso.  Just when Gil decides his relationship with Inez must end and begins gushing to Adriana about his love for her and the need to be together forever, Gil and Adriana slip into a second time warp, leading to their meeting a whole new batch of celebrities of the late 1800s such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Edgar Degas.  This second time warp experience impresses Adriana and causes her to tell Gil she cannot stay with him in the 1920s because the late 1800s was the true golden age.  During daylight the next day when Gil realizes his relationships with both Inez and Adriana are over he has a sudden flash of insight telling him that there is no golden era worth striving to enter.  We live in the era into which we are born and should make the most of it.  While walking the streets of Paris in a daze about how to proceed, he unexpectedly encounters Gabrielle, a level-headed, smiling and attractive female shopkeeper he had purchased Cole Porter records from earlier.  They walk together tuned to the same mental wavelength and the viewers are led to believe they would make a wonderful couple.  This is a delightful, full of fancy, warm-hearted and funny movie.  It is among the best work Woody Allen has offered to the thinking world.olden era he would most want to live in.

B0001XPY1G|5.0|I didn't even know there was a 'Best Of' CD available for the masses!  I thank my lucky stars for stumbling upon it.  You won't miss a beat since the album covers quite a lot with the group before during and after The King Of Pop's meteoric rise.  So ... 'Enjoy Yourself' and 'Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' ... sorry, I couldn't resist!
0345803485|3.0|This book was very badly written. But it was just what I needed to feel comfy, girly & happy. Once you get past the horribly corny name Anatasia Steele and her awful attempts at exclamatory language &#34;holy cow!&#34; And the obvious Britishisms and unlikely premise of Christian being so young & so rich, living like a New Yorker in hipster town Seattle... The book made me feel good & I loved it.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I just love how comprehensive this video catalog got assembled into one package!  You won't be disappointed.  There were songs I didn't even think The Material Girl made videos for so it's definitely a Win-Win!
B001F6TXME|4.0|This item does exactly what it's supposed to do. That being said, I will repeat what many others have complained about: the cord is much too thin. If you're not careful with this thing I can easily see the cord coming apart sooner rather than later. But so far so good for me.
B008PDROCQ|5.0|This CD brought back sentimental memories when I was stationed in England as it was released at the time.  It was wonderful hearing it &#34;for the first time&#34; again.  Knowing Barry Gibb was the force behind Dionne's obvious hits, the other minor songs on this particular album still resonated with me as I strolled down memory lane in good old London, England.  Hope you get to enjoy it as much as I do since I have such a soft spot for 80's music.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|For all those that have said the app won't open for you upon update, all you have to do is power down your kindle and turn it back on, mine did the same thing n now it works great. The only issue I have with it now is it keeps offering me an update and when I click it, it takes me to the google play store, not sure why so I just got the x next to the update offer. Hopefully amazon fixes that soon
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The device simply did not work. It came with no directions, no help. An endless loop of &#34;could not connect want to try again&#34; I will keep trying but i already have a wii console and apple tv I simply bought it because it was inexpensive. Wish me luck.
B0010358CQ|5.0|I love all of Masamune Shirow;s work. This is a derivative work but still richly  explores the world of Olympus and the complex relationships of its inhabitants. I also like the motion-capture used in it; some people do not.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not a fan. The audio doesn't sync well with video. Quality isn't nearly as good as what we get when we use Airplay on our AppleTV (even on the exact same video in the same browser on the same computer).

0891419063|5.0|Perhaps a bit tedious at times, it illuminates  what our soldiers truly experienced in that horrible conflict.Without it, we only have the distortons of Hollywood and our own perceptions,which are simply not fair to the men who experienced it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Nice little sharpener.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> • Sharpens knives, razors, etc.<br /> • 1 Set Carbide Sharpeners for 'quick' sharpening and removing gouges, burrs, and nicks.<br /> • 1 Set Ceramic Sharpeners for finishing blades and quick touch ups.<br /> • Additional Tapered Diamond Rod for Sharpening Serrations. Careful, or you'll put 'serrations' where there were none!<br /> • Lightweight. Fits easily into bag, backpack, pocket, or keychain.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> • Difficult to hold steady.<br /> • Lightweight, and moves with every tug and pull.<br /> • No way that I can see to fasten it to something or hold it down.<br /> • No manual, other than the back of the blister pack.<br /><br />The Brass  Tacks:<br /> • Decent Sharpener, could be better. Would be bigger though.<br /><br />Would I reccomend it to a friend?<br /> • Yes. But I'd also recomend he read a book on knife sharpening. I'm sure there are hundreds of free ones on the internet.
0545586178|4.0|It was impossible for me to visualize anyone else but the actors who portrayed the characters in \\"The Hunger Games\\" movie. However, this did not detract from Ms. Collins's second book of the popular trilogy. The story is written in a manner that it's unlikely you'll need to look up the meaning of any of the words. However, the complexity and suspense of the story is first rate. \\"Catching Fire\\" is not a stand-alone work and reading the first book, \\"The Hunger Games\\" (or seeing the movie,) is necessary to truly understand what has transpired before the \\"Catching Fire\\" story begins.<br /><br />The book is written in the first-person narrative through the eyes of Katniss. Once again, like \\"The Hunger Games,\\" the reader has no understanding of what is going on beyond the protagonist's perspective. This format works very well in developing the tension, suspense and mystery throughout the story. The author also convincingly shows the mental trauma of being a survivor of the Hunger Games.  The main antagonist, President Snow, is given more attention than in the first book and his odious nature adds a great deal to the suspense. New characters are also introduced that are very difficult to ascertain if they are on Katniss's side or not? Ms. Collins does an excellent job of tightening the multiple nooses around the heroine's neck and had me wondering how in the heck Katniss and her allies would get out of this complex mess?<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is an Orwellian book for teenager readers, but still highly entertaining for adults. The work is not meant as high-brow material to be discussed with the champagne crowd. A fun, edge-of-your-seat story that is as good if not better than the original. Please note that \\"Catching Fire\\" leaves off as a cliffhanger and intentionally was written for people to read the last book \\"Mockingjay\\" to find any kind of resolution to the story.

0553062182|5.0|I absorbed this book immediately upon receipt. Being a therapist whose only clients that I previously called sensitives I recognized me in them, I now have scientific research to back up the 20% of the population that is misunderstood not only by society but by the critical judges inside of us. Dr. Aron’s approach from being a HSP is brilliant and could only be written by a HSP. My life finally makes sense with the confirmation that I no longer feel like I am flawed but gifted as I always suspected. This is the most validating book for me as I share it with my clients. I sincerely hope that the suggestions of how to navigate society are as helpful for the many – now I know millions – that could benefit from this book. Well done Dr. Aron I have finally given me a break!  Rosemary A. Hughes, M.A., L.P.C.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|King draws up a very compelling protagonist here. In fact, his supporting characters are pretty great too. King has a knack for bringing characters to life such that you care about what happens to them and he shows it here in this book for sure.

B00DHHRG46|5.0|Julian Lloyd Webber is a wonderful cellist, and this recording is candy for the cello lover's ears.  The brief section of the liner notes written by Mr. Webber refer to his previous Naxos recording of works by Delius and various Irish composers, and he reflects that he and his wife (cellist Jiaxin Lloyd Webber) really enjoyed making quality music together.  However, the quantity of appealing music for two cellos was very slim, so the idea to arrange other works for two cellos was born and this recording is the result.<br /><br />The disc features works originally written by Purcell, Schumann, Rachmaninov, Saint-Seans, Dvorak, Piazzola, Monteverdi, Shostakovich, Holst, Pergolesi, Rubenstein, Nevin, Barnby, Quilter, Arvo Part, and others.  Each of these works is sweetly performed Mr. Webber, and his very talented friends (John Lenehan - piano, Guy Johnston and Laura van der Heijden - cello, and Catrin Finch - harp), and his wife.  Particularly enjoyable are Piazzolla's \\"The Little Beggar Boy\\", Monteverdi's \\"Interrotte speranze\\", Rubenstein's \\"The Angel\\", and Dvorak's \\"Autumn Lament\\", but I find no fault with any of the works on this recording.  They are all wonderful pieces in their original form, and the arrangements here are just simply beautiful.<br /><br />This is perfect music for a rainy day or a quiet afternoon.  I very much enjoyed listening to this recording.  Delightfully recommended!
0345529057|5.0|I love these books. I saw Season 1 on HBO and my friend told me there were books. I do not think I could have read them without watching the show first because there are SO MANY characters. But, I'm glad I am reading them.

B00005K3NR|1.0|Movie was defective.  There was sound in only part of the movie.  It was horrible.. To pay for a movie that one has difficulty watching is not worth it.
B00A27X972|5.0|This was the best book I have read for several years.  I recommend it without reservation.  It makes you think about accepting and appreciating the wonderful, yet fragile, life we have.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|Okay I am not a professional movie critic but this movie had a lot of depth to me.  Most action movie plots are there just to support the special effects but this was the other way around.  I recommend this movie as a good father/son movie to watch together and talk about too.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is very fun and addicting. I deducted a star because of the ad at the top corner. I really don't mind ads but when they start flashing at you to draw attention to them I think that is ridiculous. I will still play it though.  It does get harder as you progress.  There is a time limit of play and then you have to wait for a time, maybe because I don't play through Facebook. For me that is good because of how addicting it is.

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am a true fan since watching season one.  Each season gets better and better.  Season four is gripping.  Each episode leaves me eagerly waiting for the next episode to see what happens.  The storyline and characters are exciting and you never know what to expect next.  The &#34;walkers&#34; are so realistic.  It is extremely gory to  watch sometimes, but the storyline and interaction between the characters makes we want for more.
B00EVW04PE|5.0|Love me some Channing Tatum. Great actor and seems like great guy in real life. Jaime Fox did fantastic job as well.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I cried. I wish more people would read this and be open to seeing how white privilege hurts everyone and see that if people with power and money would help others who look different than them, we as a nation would be much better off.  I really commend John Grisham for having the courage to talk about power and money and white privilege and race relations. Thank you for being a catalyst to help heal our nation.

0385528752|3.0|Chip and Dan Heath have compiled some compelling evidence of the way humans process changes. Their intention is to provide helpful ideas for implementing tough changes in a variety of professional settings. The book concedes that humans are universally resistant to change. This is what makes big shifts in procedures, policies, options and other work-related routines so difficult to accomplish. But while people balk at the idea of change because of their emotional reactions, the authors believe that, if approached correctly, the same emotional connection can have the reverse effect and actually push the change forward.<br /><br />The authors have created an 'elephant and rider' metaphor to describe the role of emotions in decision making. The elephant being the emotions, big and powerful and hard to tame. The rider being puny, logical thinking that can't do a whole lot to direct the elephant where it doesn't already want to go. The Heaths provide a formula that supports change by engaging the emotions of the stakeholders.<br /><br />The anecdotal evidence is plentiful in this well-spoken accounting of change victories, but I felt the message could have been presented in one third of the pages. The Heaths' 3 basic directives: direct the rider, motivate the elephant, and shape the path. These are presented with overwhelming explanation in the first 80 pages. The following 200+ pages did not provide much added value.<br /><br />However, I greatly appreciate the perspective provided by the authors on this tough topic. Any supervisor should take the time to read this book to gain a new appreciation for the actual process of changing a workplace routine.<br /><br />I will personally use this method for presenting and supporting change in my work. I'm excited to develop clear goals and find ways to ping the emotions of my colleagues to get them on board with technology changes in our building.
1118109791|3.0|A bit disappointing. I purchased this newer version hoping for hints and practice problems for the new IRE section. However, all that was included was some wordy instructions and a code to use online to access the practice I wanted. It took hours to log in and get the code to work. I was finally able to the night before I took the test, by that time I had given up and made attempt to study the IRE section. I scored a perfect on the section but it wasn't in any part due to this book. The book was great for studying for all of the other areas and I would recommend it to anyone. But, I would not buy it solely for the IRE section.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Just finished The Ocean at the End of the Lane. It was beautiful beyond description. Read it. Just read it. You will not regret it.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|She moves the story along with such depth of character and such fascinating descriptions.  I rarely find myself noticing great sentences but this happened many times in this book. I miss this world now that I've finished it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book is full of action and backstabbing. Who can you really trust? You'll get angry, cry, heartbroken, and a whole array of emotions. Collins has done it again. An amazing book that leaves you wanting to read more and more with a turn of events and ending you don't expect.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A story about values and life through the eyes, ears and heart of a dog. What an awesome and enjoyable read with heart warming surprise ending.  I loved it.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|It's perfect! I love the app, it gets you on the program and really makes you stick to it. It's fun and a little addictive!<br />My only complaint is that it's actually pretty limited is the amount of languages available, only about 4. Although for a free app, this is amazing and way more than anyone could ask for!
B00123MAM0|4.0|Firstly, I like artsy fartsy music, so it should come to no surprise to the reader that I really like this cd.  Every song is weird in its own strange way.  Be prepared for some very unusual music if you should buy this cd.  Mostly, I like this though because it is music.  As far as I know, in the techno genre Aphex Twin was the original artist that tried to make music via computer that was also skillful and thought provoking, appealing to college students, and even geeks like me that don't like any other techno artist.  Maybe there are other good techno artists by now, but Aphex is the original, and probably the best.  The reason I don't give this 5 stars is that I don't believe that it is timeless.  Computer technology will likely evolve and I Care Because You Do will probably become dated, in favor of better written music.  Though I love them, these songs just aren't 5 star quality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keeps the mind working and needs more levels can't wait to see what more levels will look like and the challenges they will bring to the game
B000002I53|5.0|My Favorite Things gets my highest recommendation.  It is a timeless classic.  You could pull this cd out 1,000 years or more later, and this cd would still be cherished by listeners, both tone deaf and those with perfect pitch, and everyone in between.  From start to finish, everything about My Favorite Things, the compact disc, remade from the original, is every bit as worthy of cherishing.  If someone said, \\"I'm interested in jazz.  Where should I start?\\"  This would be one of probably the top 10 cds I would recommend.  I would say, \\"If you are looking for jazz, My Favorite Things won't let you down, and if it does then you might consider yourself as some sort of new species, other than human.\\"<br /><br />I actually purchased this disc a long time ago, back when I was at college and in my John Coltrane phase.  That would be roughly the year 2001.  That disc, the original, got scratched.  However, I had burned a copy of it for the car, and that disc, the one I am reviewing, has no scratches.  The original got tossed in the trash.  That brings me to an important issue.  The issue of duplicating cds, which I believe is completely okay to do in the same way people duplicated cassette tapes back in the day.  Having a back up is an important thing!  I currently have at least one cd in my 100 disc changer that can't be duplicated for whatever reason, such that if I try to burn a copy, computer won't comply.  If that had been the case with My Favorite Things by John Coltrane, I wouldn't have been able to have even a copy to write a review, all these years later, because the original would have been scratched.  That's just food for thought, and really almost aside from the review of this cd.<br /><br />This disc is definitely one of my favorites by Coltrane tied with discs such as, Giant Steps, that are among my favorite discs.  This disc is among my favorite things.  I love music, and My Favorite Things is a sonic jazz treasure.  However, it didn't spend that much time in my 100 disc changer this time, not because I don't like it anymore, but because I have much of it memorized.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love having this app on my kindle fire!! I always have a calculator with me and it is easy to use!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the Crossfire books! They stick with you for days! I can't get Gideon out of my head!  Can't wait for the next book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Keeps your total even if you turn it off. I use it to balance my checkbook and it works great!
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game sucks it. should be for free make the app free and better graphcis and I will play it but it cost way to much and I don't want to pay that much
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved the book for plenty of reasons but the main one is drew is hilarious... he points out so many things that are true and funny... Mackenzie is a funny little girl I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt when I was reading about thanksgiving dinner... can't wait to read the other books...
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Man of Steel has amazing effects, action-crammed, and Zack Snyder did a wonderful job, excellent choice in cast and directing, and acting was wonderful. It's a great movie for the whole family to see. Anyone who wants to buy this will not be wasting their money. I know I can't stop watching it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed the story but I really can't say that I loved a book.  I don't love any book, it's unreal to expect that.
B00288KNJU|5.0|Like all the movies of this type well made and fun to watch. Not really for the real young ones. Parents should watch it first before to see if it fits there family.  Having all  formats is also nice.
0307887448|5.0|This is my favorite book. Im 22 and have never been a fan of reading until this book its fun and entertaining and since I have become an serious reader always with a book in my hand.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Exhausting, a let down compared to the others-which were mediocre YA lit to begin with- just felt like a cop out. The ending is so bad. So bad.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|It has all the Holiday characters that my daughter loves. It's a story about a little boy who finds out that Jack Frost is real.  My daughter believes the boy is special because he can see Santa, the Toothfairy, and the Easter Bunny.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Interesting so far.  Not as well written as I thought it would be but her introspection is harrowing. Looking forward to her journey.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Enjoyed the book despite having to see the poor ratings by those who didn't get what they expected.  The story was thought provoking and had interesting thoughts and perceptions on human behavior and emotions.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I too have wondered what happened to Danny since he escaped his father and the Overlook Hotel. We catch up with him, now a man, in full downward spiral and quickly finding his bottom. The ghosts of his past live on and so do the spirits he watched his father fight, he now finds himself with his fingers wrapped around the same spirits while he pours them down his throat.<br />A new friend, very young and very very shiny is the catalyst along with a good dose of AA education that pulls him from the scrap of a man that he had withered to and teaches him how to find his Dragon in his dreams again. The mighty fights they see are terrifying and this isn't vampires, not exactly. They don't sparkle but they do most definitely shine.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Intense is Armin's sickest joint in years. Being an ardent fan of Armin's works except for the questionable Mirage project, he seems to have returned to melodically intense, crescendo & decrescendo tempo driven tracks that to me are his hallmarks. Experience Intense and return to the joy of Armin at his finest.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good book, had to read it for a book club.<br /><br />Great character development for Ender, good writing that kept me engaged in reading, and interesting plot.<br /><br />I didn't like the anticlimactic ending with Ender and his brother Peter. I wanted something more to happen between them besides (SPOILER) Peter dying at an old age and Ender being his Speaker.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|Beautiful graphics and an interesting storyline help weave together a great hidden objects game ,with a seemingly never ending twist that will keep you coming back again and again long into the future.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love this app. I spend hours doing puzzles. I love browsing new puzzles. The 1 free puzzle per day, on a monthly basis, is challenging because you can't see the pictures of it until it's complete. The mystery is good bait :) I have all my friends and family downloading this app.
0385351399|2.0|Story just went on and on.  It was pretty clear at the onset where this was going, but the story never seemed to end.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is a lot of fun and I like it even more then the originAl facebook game because you don't have to rely on other people to progress. However there are serious bugs in the game that need fixed, I purchased crowns and never received them and I have heard of this hAppening to others also.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The book keeps you on the edge of your seat. Wasn't so happy with the ending, I would of made it a happier one but the ending keeps the book true to life. All endings can't be happy. Can't wait for more books from Veronica.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My kids started out with this game and got me hooked.  Now I think I play more than they do.  We love it!
B008D28HYS|3.0|this was lots of fun to do but I wish there were some new puzzles other then the Random puzzles.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This little &quot;bugger&quot; starts out really easy and relaxing. Just when you think you'll get bored with it they throw you for a loop. This is no child's game. Some levels have stumped me for hours. I haven't solved the one I'm on now for more than a day, but I can't stop trying. My 21 yr. old daughter is now just as addicted as I am. Give us more challenging games like this!
1444777564|3.0|This story picks up where the first book left off.  We learn how James got to be a writer of books, and, along with Bob, relatively famous.  Overall, this is a nice, heartwarming tale...It took another live creature -- not a human, but an innocent animal -- to pierce through the layers of drug abuse and self-neglect to show James that if he really needed to and wanted to, he could overcome his self-doubt, his past, and battle his demons to become responsible for the care of another.  And eventually, for himself as well!  I wish these two the best always.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This is a great looking doll, and the detail on this doll is superb. She comes with the iconic jacket from the games, a archery set, and the iconic mockingjay symbol. She is not the average Barbie Doll. She is a collectors item, and she is for anyone who is a fan of the novels and the films.
0767919408|4.0|Love the way Bill Bryson tells a story.  This one takes us back to a particular summer in the late 1920's, when the world is watching breathlessly as numerous aviators try to cross the Atlantic; many are lost, but America takes the win this time, and as a result becomes a leading force in commercial aviation....Babe Ruth is on his legendary home run marathon, and Jack Dempsey becomes a star known for his take no prisoners action in the boxing ring.  These are just a few of the main story lines in this great book, and all the facts are fleshed out with humor and the fascinating, humanizing details that Bryson is so good at.  Another wonderful read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. Lots of people at work are even playing. I played this game since it came out and just can't stop. It great.
B0091LS07E|2.0|Got dvd girl on fire  just ok dont like the girl singing with her on girl on fire.  Probably should have bought the one song on itunes.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Elvis has never sounded better. If you want to pitch everything he ever did and save only one recording this is the one. He is in total control and the band with him James Burton for just one rips some fabulous riffs and then back to the king.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I actually cried knowing this was the last book and I felt like I was going to fall to pieces because of the book I loved this so much
B007QA3AH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie :)<br />Didn't expect too much, just wanted to see how it goes and it surprised me a lot!<br /><br />Cast is great, the story goes smooth and it has an happy ending...<br /><br />Time well spent ;)
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Does exactly what I need. Lights a closet under my steps upon entering and saved me a bundle by not having to wire it.
0061537934|4.0|I'm not sure what I can add to the other reviews out there. I was told to read this by my service advisor because she knew I had done some car racing. This is not a racing book, but there's a bit of the racer's mindset and philosophy that gets in there. The underlying plot about an ugly divorce motivates the action, but what makes the book work is the dog's love for his human.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Well written.  It brings you back to the original book which was so much better than the movie. Fast and engrossing read. Keep it up Stephen!
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|Okay, here's a movie that either is a brilliant spoof or typifies everything wrong with Hollywood. The plot is ludicrous, the acting uneven (over-indexing on the really poor), the screenplay borders on (and often crosses over into) the comical, and you'll have to work your tail off suspending disbelief. And it's over all too quickly.<br /><br />The White House is under attack by terrorists and a would-be Secret Service agent, on a tour with his daughter is the president's only hope. With that wee bit of information, I'm sure you could write the entire plot and easily predict the ending. By-and all throughout--act 3, my daughter and I were shaking our heads and laughing out loud -- yet we couldn't look away. The capital building blows up. NORAD is hacked. The president is kidnapped. The launch codes for the country's nuclear arsenal are compromised. A young girl is threatened. A father risks all to save her. The terrorists are exposed--on YouTube. You'll also get a steady stream of poorly articulated and not-so-subtle liberal politics along with healthy dabs of political correctness (probably to balance all the violence and the presence of the white male hero) and tiny National Treasure-like educational gems. The film even sports a psychotic computer geek who likes classical music and lollipops (no, I'm not kidding). It's all here woven together in an over-the-top, grammatically-challenged, incoherent mess.<br /><br />And its the mess that makes the movie eminently watchable. It's so bad, so mind-numbingly ridiculous, it serves up a great night of entertainment. Just don't tell anyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calc app is the perfect tool for all ages because of its ease. It's even better for those of us who are stubborn about using our reading glasses. The large, legible keys make using this quick and painless. I highly recommend this for everyone.
159463176X|3.0|Hosseini is a talented story teller.  However, this book wasn't anything 'new'.  Some of the characters were obvious connections to move the story along and in and of themselves fairly drawn.  But then they disappear.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I think the story has good bones.  It has a lot of potential but doesn't quite dig deep enough for my taste.  While it was enough to keep me turning the pages, I felt the end lacked resolution.  Now I'll give that it is part of a series so it doesn't need to be neat and tidy, but the major plot line should come to a close or at least a plot line.  This ended with loose ends all over the place and as I continue to think about it there is very little resolved in the end other than the main character knowing the facts of who she really is and she has her mother back, but not in a way the brings closure.  It's worth a read if your looking for a vacation book, but I've definitely read better within this genre.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Kindle fire HD made me update the app, and now or won't open. Glitch in the update? I'll fix the review when I can open the app again.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|i love searching games. this one is quite interesting. you can get lost in it easily. the graphics are very good too.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|&#34;Dear LIfe Stories,<br /><br />Alice Munro didn't win the world's biggest prize for nothing.onderful wrtiting.  Clear and simple but moving and bring you along with it.  Compassionate, interesting lives.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|So far so good. Im running this processor with a gigabyte b75-d3h mobo, 8gb corsair ram, 1tb western digital hard drive, 500w corsair psu all in a nzxt guardian 921 tower. I've been running multiple applications and streams and it has handled them with no problems. I haven't tested out the integrated graphics yet, but I do hear that it can run most modern games at around 20-25 fps.
B0051BLT4O|4.0|My girlfriend bought this to help her as she started taking photos of the food in the restaurant of the hotel she works in. She is just beginning and wanted the book for guidance on the kind of lighting equipment she should get. The book was useful, but not complete in this guidance.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|My wife found this and downloaded it for me and I haven't stopped playing it! One of the best hunting games I've downloaded!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game is fun I've played it on my friends iPhone but for some reason when u push enter the game won't make the word no matter what keyboard I use on my phone. Please fix this
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I bought this app and trust me this is the best game ever. I'm not just saying that. On this app you can visit the beach, residential area(Gru lives there)(you can go in the house)Gru's lab, and lastly womanhood lair. Have fun playing this game.<br /><br />From your friend valkire cain
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its fun and it has alot of different levels and i think every one with  a facebook should play it
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've enjoyed Facebook.  It lets me keep up with friends and students I've taught  I'm the past.  News stories, new shops,fun placed.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic!!!! I can't wait to read part 6! I couldn't put this book down!  Every part was exciting and the twist and turns were unexpected.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have always liked playing the real game so I knew I would like this one. one thing I to not like is if you buy coins then you have more than 40 and you do not increase that amount while playing or when the game is offline. since you can only store 40 it should be that you always accumulate more coins like when you do not purchase coins. yes I did purchase some coins buy will not again as I can play the waiting game. besides it gets me to turn it off so I can let the coins rebuild.
B0009IW98O|5.0|I'm talkin' bout...................heavy music,. ...........,...............heavy music.................., heavy music, heavy music,heavy music...music. (repeat) original version is much better than on Live Bullet.
140006922X|5.0|Triggered much discussion at book group which included readers of different religious/historical backgrounds; members wanted further study afterwards on topics raised
0810988232|3.0|Before i purchased the heart of faery oracle deck i read many of the reviews most negative. i to agree now. just receive them an opened my package the box was not wrapednoteven fully closed. then the book was in brand new condition and the cards themselves were not wraped and slowly bent like they wernt new at all. an one card had a slight corner were. and i no i should be furious givin the condition but the strong connection i got when i held the cards were powerful. and over all in great shape.
B008JFUNHI|4.0|Based on the series by Orson Scott Card , Ender's Game brings it popular source material that could only make a good movie in the 1980s but it uses effects like special effects from 1980s and tells the story like on 80s adventure film and mixes it with the formula to appeal to the new generation. Asa Butterfeild gets better from playing Hugo Cabret in Hugo to Ender Wiggin in Ender's Game. This is a solid adventure film with beautiful visuals on par with Gravity and Oz The Great and Powerful's a, a well told story and some of the best action scenes to be put on film. i give Ender's Game an 86.
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|Had not heard them in so long that I had to get one CD. Good days back then. Easy to get around.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A very underrated film , most people are saying ET is the best 80s film but even though that was a decent watch , ET looked very fake and i was pretty bored during the ending. But this movie has a rich plot with quirky characters and it always keeps your attention . After you see this review, Buy this movie , cook a bunch of stuff , get your entire family to come and see this masterpiece and after you will love this movie to pieces, tell everyone about it because this is an example of a perfect fantasy film. i give this band of quirky Treasure Hunter rejects a 99.
B007T99ENE|3.0|I found it a bit odd. Turns out to be a great story, but kind of odd on the way.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book and great writing by Collins! Look forward to reading the next book in this trilogy to see what happens next.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|ahhh...simply incredible....if love is out the question...overjoyed....at seventeen...bite your tongue...there's nothing else i want.....thats the way ...please....look away  :) AWESOME!
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|love all the quell games.  a nice quiet game to pass the time.  thoughtfull but sometimes too easy.  odd narration
B001DJLCRC|5.0|After the Breaking Bad series finale came and went this fall, I finally decided to check this series out and see what was generating all the buzz.<br /><br />In short, here's what's buzz-worthy: this is a show that is dark, witty, intriguing and tragicomic. It is relentlessly intense and populated with characters who could be treated in superficial ways in the hands of less skillful writers, but who end up being more complex that we we ever give them credit for when first introduced. They sometimes they act in ways that might surprise, yet don't defy logic. It takes fantastic advantage of the light terrain, scenery and culture of New Mexico to fully anchor it its location.<br /><br />This is not a show for the faint of heart or those uncomfortable with explorations of the margins of legal, ethical and interpersonal conventions. The violence is graphic and frequent, the language is adult, and the sexual situations are sometimes unconventional. You'll have to suspend some disbelief (why a full-time teacher is struggling with inadequate health care, and probably some law enforcement procedures related to one character to name a few), but not to an excessive amount.<br /><br />Mostly, Breaking Bad is a mature way to explore uncomfortable choices and to examine the many layers of a downward spiral.<br /><br />Baseball season is the the review mirror, and football season is ending soon. If you want some quality TV time in a show that targets thinking adults: Breaking Bad is an excellent choice. I wish I had the stamina to watch all 62 episodes in one sitting!
0736092269|3.0|I found it overly simplistic for me because I have used weight training for several years and learned from experts from day one by reading books. I never used &#34;Barbie&#34; weights (I like that term) and have seen most women in every gym I have been doing that. This book is excellent if you have not read all the books I have over the years but you have been to a gym for a while. If you are new at it, it will be confusing, start with a different book and then once you know what's what, get this.<br /> Also as a vegetarian of many years, I do not agree with the authors about animal derived protein other than whey which I do use and that's the only animal protein I use. Also if you like to cook, there are several recipes in the book that look good, but I do not and cannot cook to save my life so I briefly looked at that section which again if you like to cook looks good.<br />I do wish the author had listed the schedules of the exercises and the different stages a little better in a less confusing way, and I got this for my Kindle which does not help in going back to certain sections while you are reading; my recommendation is to get the paperback.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I had this app for some time and had purchased several puzzles. Then I had a problem loading it so I did what I have done in the past sent it to the cloud and then reloaded it but I lost all the puzzles I had purchased. I am not very happy about that. Nothing I can do, lesson don't do that.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game. Fast pace. Challenges increase throughout play.  Loads of fun and for free. Can't beat that no matter how you slice it.
B0081UQBJA|5.0|Loved Calvin and Hobbes growing and had to have this.  Read a few mixed reviews, still bought it.  Love it.  Binder is sturdy, will last a long time.  Hope I can share with my kids one day.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Washington finds himself in the middle of an alcoholic's dream.  He has codependents who are happy to do whatever it takes to prop him up, he has all the excuses handed to him and even further, he is truly NOT responsible for the plane crash and he saved lives that otherwise might not be saved.  It's the one dirty lie at the end, the one lie that would be the easiest one to tell...that no one would ever question but that would be the point of no return for him...even WE want him to tell the lie and be ok!!!..that gets him straight.  Wicked great movie!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Its very frustrating when you try for months to complete a room and can't get that last item and when reading the chat everyone seems to need the same thing. If you are lucky to get it you get no numbers on it then there's the con of doubling up your credits for a second chance only to lose yet again . Not fun  BB.
B003FNWR6Y|3.0|still classic monopoly with great nintendo art and beautiful notes and properties. but i expected something more nintendo-esque than just properties with nintendo characters' names.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Good story and character development.  Glad to see Grisham is back to the storyline and the writing style which launched his career.  Hope there is a sequel soon.
B00EIRLQ2M|5.0|This is an add-on pack to the &#34;GraphiLogic&#34; app that I have already reviewed.  I have now purchased several of these &#34;add-ons&#34; and have thoroughly enjoyed every one of them.  If &#34;Sudoku-type&#34; logic is your thing, you will love both the app and the add-ons.  Incidentally, each of the add-ons install seamlessly--it happens automatically, when you open the app itself, after your purchase.
6305428042|1.0|Love this movie but the quality of the dvd is awful. It stalls and skips all the time. It' s like the whole movie is in slow motion - one slide at a time. Terrible. Wish we would have opened and tried this movie shortly after buying it. We would have returned it. Now we' re stuck with a movie we cannot watch.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Interesting concept. I did not find it as engaging as some of his other novels (5 People You Meet in Heaven, Tuesdays with Morrie)&#62;
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Love it<br />keeps my phone safe<br />have sropped several times<br />Did the water test before we put the phone in
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|its a great game. it helps kids to learn about animals. it helps kids to learn about the environment as well.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|The four stars are based solely on Jimi's playing. Whether as rhythm or lead, he's playing well. The mixing gets high marks, as well. But it was very wrong to hype this collection for a major commercial release. Had it been on the Dagger label, it would've been outstanding, as most takes have historical significance. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything to help portray Hendrix as relevant in today's world. lt comes off as a bootleg with really good sound.<br /><br />My favorite song is Mojo Man, with its dirty R&B groove.
1250038820|5.0|Fantastic book. A real treasure. I never pre-order books but I did for this one. I am a huge fan.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|okay there is just one thing wrong about this author. she does not know how to end a trilogy... spoilers: you cant just let your fans get overly attatched to your heroine and in the end, just kill her off! i cried for days!!!
B000VWYJ86|2.0|A few awesome action scenes, the jump into the window was great. But, the rest was the CIA teams blabbing about Bourne in a room to make him seem dangerous, but he didn't come across that way. Here's how most of the lines went: \\"It's Bourne, he's found us...It's Bourne, he's here, Bourne is quick.... Bourne will get us... Bourne is dangerous...\\" and blah blah... It got old fast. A movie that tried to be so cool with espionage that it was silly. It wanted to be the best spy movie but was obvious. The rest was Damon running around making concerned faces. The script was even more haphazard. They should have stuck to a simple plot.
B00EEDJHXA|4.0|I love it.  I wish scissors were faster but it is challenging and calms me down! jighlly reccomend this game!
B002QYNIHU|5.0|receive in a standard Amazon package in very good condition box height measured around 7 inches packaging of the figures is  very small perfect for Dragon Ball Z I keep my fingers MOC this is my first SH FiguArts and I'm really amazed doesn't speak volumes until you see  this figure up close and personal this  Super Saiyan Son Goku looks to cool  I have ordered already Super Saiyan 3 Son Gokou & Piccolo SDCC 2013 Exclusive and by the looks of this one I surely will not be disappointed
1594202273|4.0|I am still reading this book and find it informative and frightening.  I was especially interested in his recount of the Damascus Accident as my brother (Ret Air Force Col) was directly involved on site at the time.  I had heard first hand his accounting and read other reports.  It's a miracle there were not many casualties.  On another personal note, my husband as an Air Force pilot assigned to SAC flew 24-hour airborne alerts during the Cold War in B-52s.  We knew the mission and consequences if anything went wrong but didn't dwell on it.  It was a job and they did it well.  The book is like reading a DeMille thriller.  I will keep it in my book collection.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is very fun and entertaining game, but only has ten levels. lt is challenging but solvable. Need more rooms to solve.
B0007KS7D0|5.0|A really good and inexpensive way to explore macro.  Image results are excellent, but no better than the lens it is attached to.<br /><br />Saved me a lot of money because it showed me that it isn't macro that I like taking, but close focus.  I take most of my photos outdoors, and (1) you have to get really close to do true macro, and many creatures will not let you do this and (2) the slightest breeze will throw the subject our of focus.

B00G722T22|4.0|For me this album was a combination between her older style with her newer one. It worked for me. I liked and could relate on some level to most of the songs. There were a couple of songs on this album that rose a red flag with me but I think that was more a personal preference.<br /><br />The songs that I liked \\"Rock n Roll\\"<br />\\"Here's to Never Growing Up\\"<br />\\"17\\"<br />\\"Bitchin' Summer\\"<br />\\"Let Me Go\\" (featuring Chad Kroeger)<br />\\"Hello Kitty\\"<br />\\"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet\\"<br />\\"Sippin' on Sunshine\\"<br />\\"Hello Heartache\\"<br />\\"Falling Fast\\"<br />\\"Hush Hush\\"<br /><br />Songs I Didn't Like<br />\\"Give You What You Like\\"<br />\\"Bad Girl\\" (featuring Marilyn Manson)

B000GJ0KOG|5.0|I love this movie. It is a favorite. It actually tells a story. The each character is developed and defined.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I loved these stories and admit I slowed my reading pace half way through this book to let it last longer. A wonderful story and very well written. I would recommend this trilogy to all young adults and adults who enjoy this genre as much as I do. If you enjoy easy, FUN reads with the feel good ending, then these books are a must read!
B00632HWOG|5.0|watched season one and two back to back couldn't stop watching now watching season three it gets better every week
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I was given City of Bones as a gift, and I enjoyed it. I kept visualizing how great most of it would look on screen. I'm a parent of teens so I almost didn't bother with City of Ashes. I'm SO glad I read this book. It by far exceeded the first in my opinion. The negative reviews concerning Clary and Jace is laughable to me. Use your imagination, see where this author can and is taking you with these two great characters. Read this book! I'm on my way to the third book and I plan to sit back and enjoy the ride!! :)

B006OE7XM4|5.0|It seems I've been under a rock because I had not heard of Gregory Porter until last week. I heard &#34;On My Way To Harlem&#34; on WCLK in Atlanta and it was one of those moments where I could hardly wait to get home and order the recording. Giving a record a 5 star rating may be seen as overdoing, but &#34;Be Good&#34; doesn't disappoint in any way, every mood is perfect from the major 7 groove of the aforementioned &#34;Harlem&#34; to the stirring acapella &#34;God Bless The Child&#34; and all points in between. Gregory's vocals are incredible, and that's not to leave out the stellar band. I think I could listen to &#34;Painted On Canvas&#34; every day and it wouldn't get old. Worth every dime.

B00CLO3WSK|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1993. My wife suggested that we watch it after someone sent her a clip of one of the scenes. We enjoyed it for the music even though it was a formula plot. It was nice to see a young and blooming Lauryn Hill before she was famous. Now I will have to go see the original Sister Act.

B008DVW7DQ|5.0|2 & 1/2 hours of the most wonderful singing, in a wide range of styles and periods.  Where is there a voice of more accuracy, more effortless control, more emotional truth than Jaroussky's?  And we are given everything from Vivaldi and Monteverdi  to Shostakovich, from  exquisitely sympathetic duets with Nuria Rial to swinging Purcell's Sound the Trumpet to burlesque singing contests.  ( Well, it's a shame he doesn't give us Mozart, Cherubino say, but certainly everything before that. )  As a bonus the filming is good and helpful, and the venues are Europe's finest.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it from start to finish. Have always been a King fan. This sequel did Danny proud. Loved how the family ended up all tied together.

1439190976|3.0|The Firm by Duff McDonald: A review of the book.<br /><br />This is a good story by a business writer. McKinsey is a fine firm among many other fine management consulting firms that are very good at what they offer to clients. McDonald seems to be unrealistically enamored with the &#34;grandeur&#34; of this one firm which has worked hard to build an &#34;Image&#34; perhaps more than building quality in its work. Many regard McKinsey as a &#34;formula&#34; firm, meaning that the solution to every client problem is drawn from its basic &#34;recommendation&#34; model. Robert D. Hulme 11.09.13

B00GBCMW9S|5.0|The first time that I listened to this album I was disappointed for what I had long anticipated to be [hopefully] one of the best albums of the year. I've been a fan of Em since overhearing my older brother listening to Slim Shady in the 90's. Anyway let me explain:<br /><br />The first play through was disappointing to me because I was expecting to hear a replica of MMLP, except better. Vague enough? I don't know what I wanted to hear, but Em set the bar so high for himself that when I listened to these new songs I was not impressed and felt pretty let down.<br /><br />Later the same day I realized that maybe what I wanted to hear clouded what I had heard, and so I decided that I would need to give it another play through to give it an unbiased evaluation.<br /><br />I just finished an awesome workout, and listened to the entirety of MMLP2 from start to finish without any great expectations and I was blown away; this artist has such incredible range and it is expressed in this new album. I am satisfied with my purchase: I believe the replay value is Infinite (...).<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to check this new album out! For $10 you get 21 new high quality Eminem tracks. Fair warning ... he will tell you to go **** yourself somewhere in the mix.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is far and away the best book I've read all year.  Easily worth 3x the price.  Although the setting is a big part of the story, Wool focuses more on the social interactions that have developed in an isolated silo over generations.  The character development is excellent, the flow is nearly perfect, and the ending was satisfying.  It's always a pleasure to find a new author, and I will definitely be checking out more of Mr. Howey's work.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by Nick Cole, author of &#34;The Old Man and the Wasteland&#34; (another great book).  I'm deeply grateful to him.

1451626096|1.0|I'm glad to know I'm not alone, but I wanted to add my voice to those who were appaled by this book.<br /><br />First of all, the book description at least hints at a love story.  Instead, the couple who are supposed to end the Cousin's War and reunite a war-torn country (an admirable goal, even without love) start their relationship with Henry raping, insulting and degrading Elizabeth in every way he (or his mother) can think of.  I almost stopped reading right there, but I plowed through all 519 pages, hoping to see this jerk humbled and learning the error of his ways.  After all, this is Elizabeth of York telling the story.  The daughter of the White Queen and the granddaughter of the The Lady of the Rivers; decended from the Goddess Melusina.  Surely, I thought, she'll teach this arrogant jerk the right way to treat women--and also how to rule a country, since the author makes it clear (over and over) that he's incompetent as well as a villain.<br /><br />Instead, Elizabeth does absolutley nothing but wring her hands and repeat the words \\"I don't know\\" for the entire book.  She makes a few feeble attempts to teach Henry how to rule, but those are quickly dropped.  She also (for reasons unknown) falls in love with her rapist, without him ever appologizing, or falling in love with her.<br /><br />Elizabeth continues to do nothing while Henry's mother usurps Elizabeth's place as queen, even though she was trained to run a court since childhood, and knows that the people love (and need) her.  Yet not once in the book is there even a hint that she involved herself with ruling--or even organized a banquet, decorated a palace, or greeted a foreign ambasador. (Although she does occassionally sew clothes for the poor.)<br /><br />I also found it strange that the protagonisit's mother was so determined to find her lost son and put him on the throne that she was willing to drag the country back into a bloody war and endanger the lives of her daughter and grandchildren to make it happen.  No one had seen Richard since he was eight years old.  Didn't anyone consider that Richard of York might turn out to be the kind of man who would kill his own nephews and imprison his sister in order to grab the throne?  Elizabeth sat there and watched Henry do far worse without lifting a finger to stop it.ake it happen.  No one had seen Richard since he was eight years old.

0399162097|5.0|This is an extraordinary novel, perfectly written. For those who haven't read it, I recommend not learning too much about the story. It won't ruin anything to know about the characters but I imagine it would be fascinating to just read the book cold.<br />Karen Joy Fowler has brought a subject matter - an amazing & devastating (and much of it factual) subject matter - to light in a fierce, inspiring way. The way she weaves the story allows you to face harsh truths without feeling like you're going to drown. She's a writer you can trust to take you to uncomfortable places. With intelligence, compassion, passion, humor and honesty, Karen Joy Fowler presents a powerful, important book. Read it.

B000002UHG|5.0|I have to say that those who say this doesn't sound like Pink Floyd are the ones who need to get their heads checked. This album is the MOST FLOYDIAN of ANY Of the FLOYD solo works including ALL of Roger Waters, David Gilmour, and Nick Mason. All of their solo works are excellent, of course, but Broken China is an honest album by Pink Floyd's prodigal son. It makes me sad that Floyd didn't do any more new music (after DB) because I think Wright's contributions and skill as a composer (that's right COMPOSER) would have been welcome in nearly all Floyd circles. Give this album a chance. For those who don't like it and don't see the connection to Pink Floyd, YOU are the one's who need new ears. Oh, and Rick Wright's Wet Dream is terrific too. I always loved his voice and PF underused it. Zee was an interesting techno synth experiment, but I can see why Floyd fans would not like that one. Wet Dream and Broken China are classics and anyone who likes Wright's contributions to the Floyd canon (Summer 68, Stay) should enjoy his two albums.

B008JFUS28|4.0|The Avengers have taken the movie world by storm; but aside from Iron Man, if there has been any character that has made big impression on silver screen, it would be The God of Thunder: Thor. Whether you enjoy the interpretation, or just like Tom Hiddleston's Loki, the fact is that Thor has become a must see hero on screen. The character's journey began in the summer of 2011 and now the Thunderer's adventures continues in Thor: The Dark World. Directed by Alan Taylor, The Dark World brings Marvel's Phase 2 to the Holiday Season;which is a new step for the studio. Business standpoints aside, is the next chapter of Thor worthy of not just the The Mighty Avenger, but Marvel Studios?<br /><br />The Dark World continues the tale of Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Since the destruction of Bifrost, The God of Thunder has been restoring order to the nine realms while missing his mortal love interest Jane Foster (Natalie Portman). However when Jane discovers a power called the Aether, Thor takes her to Asgard. Just as things get more puzzling, the ancient Dark Elves awaken and attack the Asgardians. To stop the Dark Elves' leader Malekith (Christopher Eccelstein) and protect Jane, Thor must do the unthinkable and make an unlikely ally: his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston)<br /><br />I found The Dark World's story to be straightforward. This is cased example of what you see is what you get. Unfortunately, that was a problem. I wanted to see more from this story. There was bigger then life adventure just waiting to be explored in this film, but it never took off. Yet just because story wasn't perfect, doesn't mean it's a bad plot. The story is easy to get into and it does build itself up. The Dark World indeed has a cinematic tale; but a subplot or two would not have hurt anything.<br /><br />If there was one thing I could count on, it was the character. The 2011 film gave us two strong characters out of Thor and Loki, so I could only hope for the best in this new film. It is safe to saythat both Thor and Loki are established characters; which made it difficult for two to develop any further. Despite that, Hemsworth and Hiddleston continue to impress as the Asgardian pair. Unfortunately I can't say the same for everyone else. At the very least, every character had something to do in this sequel; but I was really hoping for some development. For example, Lady Sif (Jaime Alexander) look as if she was going to receive a prominent importance in this film; but her time never came. This also goes for the film's villain: Malekith. Marvel has been good with their villains, but as a character, Malekith did not go anywhere. He was threatening and nothing more. Then again, if you know his source material, there was not much to work with. The character development could have been better, but the overall performances were good; which saves this element.<br /><br />Thor: The Dark World continues a trend of Marvel films by being technically flawless. The visuals are a sight to be hold. I was impressed seeing how Alan Taylor's direction in the likes of Asgard differ from Kenneth Branagh. I felt that Alan Taylor explored the ideas created in Thor by furthering the blend of mysticism and science fiction. Along with great visuals came the stunning action. The sequences were another great edition to the Marvel Universe by combining practicality and special effects.<br /><br />The Dark World had a number of good scenes. To no surprise, one of these moments deals with Thor and Loki together. However, the scene that really stood out was the final battle between Thor and Malekith. Marvel is getting good at making their fights stand out, and this fight was no different. It captures the idea of how these godly characters wood duel, and it did it in a unique fashion.<br /><br />As the storm begins to settle, it appears that Thor:The Dark World is not as strong as the other Marvel films. There was so much potential in this film to be great; but instead what we got was just agood film. I find that The Dark World is a bridging sequel. This is a kind a film that will help us get from Thor to Thor 3. So there is a point to this movie. Aside from that, the movie was solid enough.  The Dark World may not have been a great sequel, but it was still a good continuation to Thor's Cinematic Adventures.<br /><br />Check Out The Review Here: [...]

B002UM5BXW|4.0|Bourdain's comments ring true.  It was entertaining to see some of the inside story on New York dining, although that story can change quite rapidly.  I enjoyed reading about his favorite chef and visited his small restaurant and appreciated Bourdain's recommendation.  Bourdain is a show in himself and his comments on the culinary world are worth considering, although not quite &#34;Gospel.&#34;
B008JFUS28|5.0|That was like really fast. I literally just watched this movie hours ago and here it is already on pre-order.<br />Anyways long story I loved this movie, I loved it's story and I loved Loki.<br />Definitely adding this to my Marvel collection.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game but I don't like having to wait for help to unlock the next level. I request as I'm supposed to, but it can still take days or weeks to move on.
0345803485|4.0|The book was repetitive and while it set the story up well it did not develop the plot. I did not know that it was a trilogy when I read it. I suspect it could have been condensed into one book with a well developed plot, follow through and ending.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This is a very informative film that everyone should see! I'm buying more copies for family.<br />In our home we are trying to eat healthier - this is an excellent documentary added to our collection.

1451613520|3.0|This is a history in Cliff Notes style. Too short on insight and too long on misinformation of U.S.. A topic that requires<br />authors with greater gravitas.
B008JFUS28|5.0|*This review contains only minor spoilers - merely a short recap of the film's beginning to establish context.<br /><br />Thor and Asgard offer Marvel it's biggest cinematic challenge (likely until Guardians of the Galaxy) in terms of story and characters. It's a mystical world filled aliens, realms, and strange beasts. It's a difficult process to establish the story, and Thor: The Dark World begins like Thor did, begins with a detailed story narrated by Odin (Anthony Hopkins). It establishes our villain, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) and his motivations. It establishes the plot device - MacGuffin - in the Aether, a powerful fluid that can cast complete darkness across whatever it touches. It's in fact more complicated than that, but the setting is placed.<br /><br />As for our remaining cast, the story takes places immediately after the events in The Avengers. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is marched in chains to stand before Odin for judgement. Loki's hate for Odin is as strong as ever, although his love for his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) is still strong. Thor on the other hand is busy fixing Loki's mess across the realms. Eventually, we'll see that Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is discovering strange events related to The Convergence, an aligning of the nine realms. This is how Jane and Thor's lives will overlap.<br /><br />I only detail the story this far as an example of how complicated the story is to setup the remaining events of the film. It's not too complicated that you get lost, but it demonstrates that Marvel has a daunting task with the mystical elements of their cinematic universe. It's a task that they and director Alan Taylor (a few Game of Thrones episodes) handle extremely well. Taylor steers us through an expanded look at the realms, the depths of Asgard and the technologies of the Dark Elves (Malekith and his army). It's also an appropriately dark film, thematically. Lots of people die, there's limb severing, stabbing, slaying and plenty of war battles. Despite that, Marvel never loses it's way and ensures that the writers and Taylor balance that with easily the funniest scenes from any Marvel movie to date.*<br /><br />Malekith is a real threat to Asgard and all of the realms. He isn't easily beaten, his army is supernaturally strong and determined. He and his minions beat Thor and Asgardian troops into submission plenty of times. If there's any complaint with his character is that he's given less screen time than he deserves. His ever-present threat is what drives the film primarily.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth continues his good performances as Thor, but as usual, Tom Hiddleston steals the film as Loki. It's clear that Hiddleston loves this role and he pours everything he's got into it. Thankfully, more time is given to just Loki and Thor together and they're some of the best scenes of the movie.

Rene Russo is a real surprise and treat as her role is expanded to give a glimpse of why she's queen and that she can just as easily stand at the ranks of the warriors in her family. Natalie Portman gives a nice performance as well as a few wonderful scenes with Stellan Skarsgård.<br /><br />Visually, Thor: The Dark World is beautiful. The graphics are impressive, but the sets are just as intricate as Thor, so it's a world that feels real and authentic. Lots of care is given to make the world and story stand on their own and not feel like the strange, mythical world that awkwardly fits into the Earth-centric stories of Captain America and Iron Man. It's a fun, hilarious and yet serious film that moves all of our characters forward on their ultimate journey leading to The Avengers: Age of Ultron and beyond.<br /><br />*[ A scene between Loki and Thor walking together will go down as many people's favorite in the movie, and possibly their favorite scene to date in this Marvel universe.]s. Despite that, Marvel never loses it's way and ensures that the writers and Taylor balance that with easily the funniest scenes from any Marvel movie to date.*<br /><br />Malekith is a real threat to Asgard and all of the realms. He isn't easily beaten, his army is supernaturally strong and determined. He and his minions beat Thor and Asgardian troops into submission plenty of times. If there's any complaint with his character is that he's given less screen time than he deserves. His ever-present threat is what drives the film primarily.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth continues his good performances as Thor, but as usual, Tom Hiddleston steals the film as Loki. It's clear that Hiddleston loves this role and he pours everything he's got into it. Thankfully, more time is given to just Loki and Thor together and they're some of the best scenes of the movie.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book is really good but I haven't even started it yet. Lol oh well they are making me do a review
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is a great game but the upper levels are hard if you can't afford to buy boosters, which I can't. So I get bored fast
0316789798|5.0|This book is very helpful for my son (6 years) to look up pictures, when he is not certain how to draw them.  Easy way to learn how to draw.
0312330537|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Great story about crime and punishment, culture clashes, and friendship. It's full of action and romance--not just between the protagonist and women, but also with him and India.

B00D8CSVLW|5.0|I'm not American. I live worlds away from the Us south,  yet I am fascinated by Grishams' writing. I read and own most of his books. I love all of them. However this one is a real GEM and I ended up in tears.
B004INHTK4|4.0|Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a book written by Amy Chua. Amy Chua is a Chinese American. In this book she writes about her strong and willful parenting style as a Chinese mother and compares it with the weak American style of parenting. Americans hold their children’s whims and wishes above their own, whereas Chinese children are enforced to act as per their parents’ wishes and choices.<br /><br />­­Amy is a Professor at Yale University of Law and she has two daughters. The eldest daughter, Sophia, is the obedient and sincere Chinese-American. The younger daughter, Lulu is rebellious and there are a lot of skirmishes in the book between Amy and Lulu.<br /><br />Amy forced Sophia to play the Piano. At one point of time Amy finds small teeth marks on the piano on which Sophia played.<br /><br />Lulu played both violin and piano when young. As she grew up she played the violin more. Sometimes, Amy would make Lulu skip her lunch/recess breaks at school so she could practice violin. The children were always busy, with their piano or violin sessions. They were not allowed to go to sleep over, have a play date, be in a school play and get grades less than A.<br /><br />I thought her parenting style was extreme when she rejected the birthday card her daughters’ made, saying that they have not worked on it enough and makes them do her a better birthday card. Amy’s mother-in-law expires due to cancer. The children have to write a short speech for their grandmother, which will be read at the funeral. Amy is behind the children correcting/editing their speech. Amy did not care about the kids’ grief at losing their grandmother; she wanted a perfect speech which everybody will appreciate.<br /><br />I found it a bit humorous and ridiculous when Amy tries to practice her Chinese parenting style on her pet dogs. After her futile efforts she settles that her pets will not have jobs like bomb sniffer dogs and lets them be as they want.<br /><br />It is definitely not a book from which you can take parenting advice but it gives you an idea of one extreme in parenting style.t a book from which you can take parenting advice but it gives you an idea of one extreme in parenting style.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Even in Canada, this is working wonders. I wish I could get another, as it's unfortunately unavailable in Canada at the moment.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Hi Amazon, it is me Georgia. God Bless You.  I liked it a lot with a Big Five Star rating.  There have been movies done of the people from the stone age, and if you can remember that one movie were the lady was dress in her cavewomen dress and I think it was  Ms. Welch.....watching the father taking care of his family to keep them out of harms way was funny and interesting as to what was going to happen next.  Their home was falling away, they had to leave and find a new home. Well they did that was better then the last one and even a new family member was added as well as wild cat turn into house cat.  Then the one thing that held this family together that the daughter was the one to know what a family going in and out of one thing to the next.....was LOVE.  A father protecting his family, even his mother-in-law and new son-in-law was love no matter what he would face.
B00DFR99WA|4.0|Me and my wife have a kind of date night at home where we watch a movie together with a big bowl of popcorn with the lights turned out.  My taste kind of veers toward \\"Spiderman\\" and hers doesn't so sometimes a compromise on my part is in order.  This week we watched this product of chickmeister Nicholas Sparks.  Naturally I went into it with a slight sense of dread.  I've never read a Sparks book or seen a movie adaptation so \\"Safe Haven\\" was an initiation of sorts for me.  My impressions are the people are pretty.  The kids are cute.  Easy on the eyes Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel have good romantic chemistry.  The North Carolina coastal scenery was nice to look at.  Plot wise this film struck me as a reimagining of \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" as informed by M. Night Shyamalan.  This isn't entirely a bad thing because Shyamalan hasn't been Shyamalan for at least ten years.  This is a film that defies criticism.  Released to coincide with Valentine's Day this is an old fashioned date movie nothing more or less.  Next week my wife and I will watch \\"X-Men\\".
1936891026|5.0|Very inspirational! taught me things about myself when it comes to trying to work in the arts! People from all walks of life can benefit from this book.
0670026557|5.0|Hard to put this book down. Besides having well researched information on the ways people act as givers or takers the book also has suggestions on how to avoid burn-out when giving hurts your own life.<br /><br />This is not a self-help book as much as it gives insight on why people act certain ways. Anyone in the business world, the non-profit world or really any adult will get valuable tips that help deal with &#34;takers&#34; by learning how to spot them earlier than usual and head them off.<br /><br />I had already figured out through experience some of these ideas but one important idea brought out is that sometimes by giving MORE but in a different way helps cure burnout instead of stopping altogether which can be depressing if you enjoy helping people.<br /><br />And guess what--&#34;givers&#34; live longer and are healthier than other people (mostly) but again you need to make sure you are giving in a healthy way.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|It was what I ordered and expected, but I did find a boxed Season 1, 2 and 3 at Costco cheaper than what I paid for this one DVD. That was disappointing.
B00EBJ624O|5.0|From a pianist point of view, these are considered to be two of the most technically challenging concertos ever written. Hard to believe that these were recorded in a single concert, back to back. I wonder how many people understand how difficult it is for a pianist to do that and hold it together for more than an hour. Yuja is brilliant, it's as simple as that. A great pairing with Dudamel and this orchestra. Wonderfully done.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Very easy to use, great way to have all my pictures in one place!! The app loads very quickly as well. Very pleased with it. Must have if you use picasa.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This 1964 Disney masterpiece has it all: great music, great dancing, great acting, good animation, character development, humor, charm, and a unique story. I won't delve into the plot, but rather want to focus on the aforementioned attributes. The film features some of the all-time classic songs, which add warmth to the experience. The acting is superb, with a vivacious Julie Andrews as the perfect choice in her role, as is the charming Dick Van Dyke. The actors in this movie mesh, which generates great character development, thus moving the story along. Mary Poppins is a balanced movie that's anchored by a great and unique story that touches our senses and leaves a lasting impression. A timeless classic that shouldn't be missed!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Lovely game hopefully there will be a second one can't wait  I hope there will be more animals to rescue
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its an awesome game and I enjoy playing it thanks for making it available on my kindle fire H D
B004BLJQOK|3.0|I read the novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist and viewed both the Swedish film and the American remake. &#34;Le Me In,&#34; though a fair film, falters for me in so many ways when compared to the Swedish original, &#34;Let The Right One In.&#34; The story is less coherent, the photography less captivating, and the acting noticeably lacking in comparison.
B00870ZH3U|1.0|The story line and music do not live up to The Phantom of the Opera. I was very disappointed in not just the writing but in the whole production. The musical style that set the original PoTO apart from the rest of Broadway is mostly lacking in this sequential edition.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have not been  emotionally invested in a  book like this. Ever. Beautiful, moving, Liesel is just an astonishing character. I wanted to hug  the Hubermanns. And Rudy... oh to just give Rudy the kiss he so desperately wants. I will recommend this to as many people as I can. I couldn't give it enough praise.
0425263916|5.0|I liked it a lot and I could stop reading wanted to know what would come next, full of suspense and love
B00DJYJPLO|4.0|I didn't see the first two so nothing to compare this with but it can stand on it's own. I was taken off guard as someone who gravitates towards the action/thriller genre this film reminded me of a reality documentary showing how feelings/thoughts can so quickly oscillate between two people. I was waiting and waiting for some action, but found myself pulled in by the witty and natural exchanges between are two lovers (haters?) and anticipating the build up to the next mood change.<br />As far as the dialogue I was looking for the editing breaks in scenes so that I could appreciate the length of time they were able to memorize their exchanges. Au contraire, the acting left me laying odds I was listening to a spontaneous improv tete-a-tete performance. Yes, it did drag at times but that's how conversations can go.<br />Yes, a few not-so-polite words which I am critical of when a writer uses them as a cheap hook to give a character or movie toughness, but in this case I thought it was spot-on appropriate to emotionalize our character's feelings towards each other.<br />This is a movie for readers - those who have that mindset to pay close attention to the lines and between the lines.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|well designed as the camera<br />sure it uses power, that's why you keep extra batteries handy<br />I could not do without this option
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|First of all, if you are on the line about purchasing this CD, and you love remixes by modern day dj's, then let me just say this - GO FOR IT!!!  I am a child of the \\"extended dance mix\\"  generation.  When every artist worth anything worth listening to was letting dj's and remixers remix their songs, I was on board.  Anyone could have put out a remix album where the tunes and the melody's were sampled and played with - these are remixed masterworks.  Stripped down and rebuilt!!!  I don't care if Afrojack dubbed the hell out of Dim All the Lights, he reinvented it (it's a dub, words are minimal).  To me, he took what he felt was the essence and made sauce out of it!!  Each remix makes me feel different but they all work for me.  They all make me want to dance and they all show the love that each remixer gave to the song they chose to do.  This release is so relevant to the dance music scene today.  If you do decide to purchase and you don't like it, give it to a gift to someone who will appreciate it!!!  I've been playing mine since I got it and I am happy to re-live these classics with a new beat, a new sound, and new life!!!
B00005JN0T|5.0|With so many bad movies coming out nowadays, this is a solid scifi classic that I can watch to restore my sanity. Will Smith is a perfect fit, and the storyline is solid. This is a pop culture quotable movie, with my favorite being &#34;I'm sorry, I'm allergic to Bull S***.&#34;<br />Definitely recommend this to add to your scifi or mystery collection.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|used on kindle fire but great because of syncing capabilities to other devices. great for organization and keeping notes on the go.
B000OVLBHG|3.0|This movie is an old school scifi flick made off a famous book, but it's done so in a less than serious manner. At times the action is almost slapstick, but with decent computer graphics it makes for some curiously interesting space combat. It's not a good movie, but you find yourself watching (and occasionally rewatching) it none the less.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|More challenging than bejeweled. This game offers more challenge and strategy. It offers more interaction with friends. I've had more fun with this than with other games similar to it.
B00005JNJV|5.0|An emotionally gripping and uplifting take on the Batman mythos, Batman Begins focuses on how Bruce Wayne became Batman an does so with a solid storyline and exceptional acting. This is a movie you can watch on a bad day to uplift and inspire you to face the gritty world and prevail.<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a pulse.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY!!!!!! So glad they finally got this app for kindle fire!!!!!!  Have not experienced anything wrong with it!! :)  love love love this app!!
B0024FADAQ|4.0|Filmed like a B-movie, The Last Starfighter is a must see experience for any scifi space fanatic. It's an upbeat, hopeful, dream-fulfilling flick that will leave you fulfilled at the end and eager to go out and achieve the impossible. Sadly, we have very few of these movies coming out nowadays.<br />A definite recommendation to add to your scifi collection.
1596434252|5.0|This was an AWESOME book for my kindergartener! We are able to interact with her in reciting the alphabet. I watched a youtube video of it and purchased right away! Everyone who flips through the book thinks its great - even if we have already mastered the alphabet! buying one for pre-K/K teacher.
1250037751|2.0|Overall, an interesting story centered around the love of books. A modern mystery to decode secret messages from the past and perhaps find immortality. Written in a simple language with a younger audience in mind, I found the Google references and reverence a little silly. Since I suffer from the incurable disease of having to finish every book I start, I went along with the stereotypical young and smart \\"googlers\\" and the old generation of technologically challenged characters in their quest to solve the ancient mystery. Fortunately, it unravels in a somewhat clever and believable way. I will definitely pass it along to my teenagers to read. The book cover even glows in the dark!  No disrespect, but this is really not my kind of book.
B00FXRTWQ8|3.0|First let me say that I love Fishdom. However, I was led to believe by a commercial I watched about the android version of Fishdom Spooky that the ornaments in the tank would be animated. They were in the video, but not on here. Is it only animated on GooglePlay? I was really excited about a band of moving skelton musicians, so I have to dock stars until this gets updated if it ever does. I like decorating my tank more than the actual game itself, so to feel like i'm missing a key visual feature is frustrating. Please update and i will give you guys a million stars for Fishdom!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Love this show and it makes me soooo sad that it was canceled with a huge cliff hanger at the end of the second season.
B00E9ZATJO|4.0|same characters plus many new ones, love the first one, like this one. not sure what's missing but, still a great funny movie .
B00F35BV64|3.0|Definitely doesn't have the pacing and fun of the first one. I actually found this one boring and I'm glad I only rented it. I know it's a reimagined universe, but their dress uniform, and more importantly the hat(!), are distractingly incongruent. The engine room is clearly a brewery that's been redressed, ala Space Mutiny. The bridge just feels thrown together on a sound stage, the technology on it is eclectic and anachronistic.<br /><br />I do find the actors have captured their counterparts well, especially Pine. He reminds me constantly of Shatner's Kirk and his god complex. The plot was pretty weak, however, and there's no attempt to follow any hard science. This one had too many tests of my suspension of disbelief.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Great sounding CD, very good tunes, amazing guitars and more melodic vocals. The leads in this CD are up front in your face and they're incredible.  Sinister Gates is even better  than before, if that's even possible. Awesome!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I have one word. Awesome. Nice story, easy to use controls and nice graphics. One of the better games I've played.
B001W79MBI|5.0|Sword of the Stranger came safe and sound, earlier than expected, and it was priced very fairly. Great service and it is an amazing movie!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At first it was pretty easy then it made me think more. I really enjoyed myself. Finished all the levels it took me an hour. I hope more rooms become available soon.<br />Thanks
B005V5WBFG|2.0|I continually get notifications on my Kindle that an update to the app is available. After going to the site I find out that the current app is up to date. Notifications come to my device immediately after I dismiss them. This is ridiculous.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I would have given it a five if the editing worked better there are somethings that I can't move other then that it is a great game. Love all the different animals like the Phoenix.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|love this game just trying to get gemstones dragons and rare dragons and this game is fantastic I can not give this game a 3or below stars
B007RE0SCW|5.0|it liked very much to my friend. i am going to buy more items in the nearest future. thank you
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The original review for this book did not do it justice. There is so much more to this than I thought when I read that review. If you read this, and do not look around you at all the excess you have an appreciate it a little more then you aren't human. The political allegory alone deserves an essay but add to it our need to surround ourselves with useless things and take for granted the simple in order to call ourselves successful and you could write a thesis. Absolutely worth the read.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Great flick. Arrived on time, packaged as described.This is a great Clint movie with a good ending.I bought it as gift.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|One of the best off-road games out there.  NEED to have better throttle control.  Just slow and wide open Isn't enough.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like it<br /> U guys play it the best free game I had ever play please play it<br />It should be good for u allllllllllll
B00BUKZ4O6|4.0|Cute story for kids but also nice to sit and watch with the kid(s).  3D is excellent.  Buy it for the kids.  If you don't have kids, buy it anyway.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm ridiculously happy that this is finally on the kindle fire. I'm horribly addicted and now don't have to wait until I can get to a computer to play this.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is one of my husband's all-time favorite shows.  I bought it to send it to him in Afghanistan.  He has enjoyed watching it.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|First of all, some of the bad reviews here are laughable.  I mean, this is an album of music, not something that was intended to save the world from its current course of destruction. It was meant to be listened to and enjoyed, not over analyzed ad nauseaum. Celine has a beautiful voice.  Maybe it has changed some since she first started singing but isn't that a normal progression?  This album is wonderful. I have every English album she has ever released and if she continues to produce music as beautiful as this I will continue to buy!
B007PFD90G|2.0|My main interest in this book is the set of relationships among all the &#34;important people&#34; who come and go. That Rushdie is such a good writer allowed this reader some entertainment. But there is scant satisfaction in following his lopsided version of 'he said/she said' where we are expected to believe what 'she said' bsed on what 'he said.'
B00C6B9XCW|1.0|What might one call this... try &#34;PILGRIM's REGRESS.  Or perhaps, &#34;What NOT with Which to Fill a Young Mind&#34;<br /><br />'Nuff said.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Typical John Grisham. Lots of detail in the first half of the book. Stay with it. It gets really good, and you will not be able to put it down until the end.
0316204366|4.0|My husband just finished reading this latest offering from author Gladwell.  He found it interesting in much the same manner as previous books by Gladwell and believes that those who have enjoyed Gladwell's other books would also enjoy this one.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|An exciting story about a blue bird, and the lady who recuses him when his cage falls off the truck. Then there is the part where the bird is kidnapped. A very good movie, and I believe the young ones will enjoy it as well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A great writer....enjoyed every one of his books. So sorry he had to pass away so early in his career! He certainly knew how to write a great book!
B00006LLOG|5.0|I used to shy away from this album, preferring Reed's later work. Upon the sad news of his passing, I finally upgraded my old CD to this newer remastered version. While I still don't think it's his best album, it really is a sterling collection of glam rock classics. Of course, 'Walk on the Wild Side' is here and was a deserved hit, plus 'Perfect Day,' 'Satellite of Love,' and 'Vicious' are all early Reed classics. There's really not a dull moment on the disc - and the remastering is great, really bringing out the dynamics in the music. Two demos - 'Hangin' Round' and 'Perfect Day' - are great (with early lyrics that say \\"summer's day\\" instead of \\"perfect day\\") and make me wish we could hear demos for all of the songs. And the vintage radio commercial for the album is priceless (makes it sound like they were advertising a horror movie or something!). Lou Reed was one of the greatest and this album is him at his most accessible.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|As a reader, I feel betrayed, I will never read a Veronica Roth book again.  I would add more detail, but I don't want to spoil the ending.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a powerful message was conveyed in this story of Auggie Pullman! What does it mean to be seen as &#34;different&#34; in the eyes of others---especially kids? Middle school can be an extremely rough time for many but through just a bit of kindness, a young student's life could be made just that much easier.<br />Wonder is a book to be read by kids and adults. Parents could most definitely share in the reading experience to help to instill & discuss the message found throughout the book - showing kindness towards other.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is the basis for my present system. I cannot give benchmark results, but I know the present configuration is faster than the old one.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|This is one of the better animated movies out there, and it has a great lesson in it. I have watched it several times, and each time I see it, it stimulates the imagination. Not for the very young as there are some  scary scenes
145160713X|3.0|I saw the book when my wife was reading it. I quickly browsed through and it seemed interesting. Then I started to read more carefully the section about how airplane wings produce the lift and the Bernoulli equation.  The author is wrong on many accounts when discussing that subject, so I stopped reading there.<br /><br />By the way, a much better discussion about the lift of wings can be found in Doug McLean's book 'Understanding Aerodynamics: Arguing from the Real Physics.,
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Gave this to my husband who is an avid Harry Potter fan.  He has watched every movie at least 4 or 5 times.  I would recommend this set as it will be just as fun to watch 10 years from now.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|I purchased this equipment with expectation for a reliable Access Point solution. I continued upgrading the firmware until the last one (2.0.6.1) that turned this equipment into piece of junk.<br /><br />Connections started to dropping intermittently. Tried everything suggested on community/blogs but it won't help.<br /><br />Thanks to CISCO for cleverly disabling their older equipments via firmware upgrade \\"WAP4410N Firmware Release 2.0.6.1\\" so folks can buy newer ones.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is an excellent headset for gaming, Skype, and casual use.  This is NOT an excellent headset for the audiophile.<br /><br />Pros:  Quality - Durable - construction, Wireless with excellent range (makes it to my kitchen anyway), Great battery life, Decent sound quality in stereo mode, adjustable sidetone (hear your voice on microphone in ear), on-headset volume control roller<br /><br />Cons:  &#34;7.1 Surround&#34; mode - Completely useless, lackluster low frequency (bass)<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to give this five stars, I love the utility of this headset, but the stupid &#34;7.1 Surround&#34; and iffy low freq. requires a star be docked from this review.<br /><br />It's well built.  I purchased another wireless headset (Creative World of Warcraft edition) a while back that literally snapped in two after a week of use, so I appreciate the construction of this (especially the use of metal vs. plastic at the adjustment points - where my other headset broke).  The battery life is great, and I can use it anywhere in my apartment - as long as I'm not using the microwave...<br /><br />The bass response isn't what I'd like it to be.  To Logitech's credit they do have decent EQ available in their software, but I just couldn't get the bass to a level that I liked.  My real problem is with the advertised surround sound.  Please note:  This is not why I bought the headset, I bought it for convenience and utility, but the effect is just so bad that it merits mention.  When you switch it on...for most playback it just feels like a horrible reverb effect is thrown on top on the audio.  It just sounds...bad.  Basic stereo mode is so much better.<br /><br />I don't want to be too critical of this headset.  I love it, it's wireless, and works great for most of my use cases.  The &#34;surround&#34; sound effect just pissed me off.  It shouldn't be advertised as such.  It's only a silly special effect from software that just doesn't work properly.  I had to remove a star.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Watched this at home before seeing the sequel in the theater, glad I did. It is hilarious. Helen Miren (sp?) is one of my favorite actresses.
B003ASLJKO|5.0|This is a great movie, with Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds together in Chicago in the 1930's. It's a funny movie, and I recommend it if you like humor in your mysteries. Very Good Movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is an amazing story told from a very unique point of view. It's a book that you will keep thinking about long after the last page is read.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very awesome<br /> And cool and challenging I love it and it is very addicting and I give kootas to the mAster mind behind it also
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well crafted app. Looking forward to the new levels coming soon! Good crisp graphics. Great fun! Not too easy, not too hard.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the idea and as far as YouTube or Chrome Tabs are concerned, this device does what it is supposed to do. I'm living in Germany, and despite having a Netflix account and being able to route my internet traffic through the U.S., you cannot get it playing nicely with this setup out of the box without hacking your router. After a lot of internet research I found out it has to to tiwth the fact that Google is routing any Chromcast traffic across its own DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4.) and the user has no option to change that.<br /><br />For now, I am happy with my Chromecast being a &#34;YouTube stick&#34; only - that's much less painless than starting YouTube on my Multimedia PC which is attached to the TV set, although I am not shure if it's worth its price, then.<br /><br />If it could replace the Multimedia PC, though, it would be perfect. That is: Playing local media, Spotify, Netflix outside the U.S. etc.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|More than satisfied! This was one of their best live recordings. The energy can be felt thought the album.  Thank you!
0316322407|5.0|I work as a teacher of ELL 5th and 6th graders.  A few of our students are enjoying reading this book as part of their class work.<br />This is an inspirational book of a marvelous human being which should be required reading for middle school and high school kids.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pretty much perfect for what it does – especially Netflix – but it still doesn't do enough.  Open up the APIs, Google!
B00EJYGQFG|4.0|I thought I was pre-ordering her latest album and it is just the single, &#34;Applause.&#34;  I love Lady Gaga's music but rather disappointed to find out that I was not ordering the entire album.  I do love the single &#34;Applause&#34; but I rather had the entire album than just the single.
B009LIQ55G|5.0|Pogue are Brilliant<br />Shane Mc Gowan was amazing the band were totally together including the brass section. Parisian crowd amazing, Chevron will not be forgotten
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very good for the price, love being able to send videos from the computer to my TV. Google a bit slow on opening up its features to other devs, but hopefully that will come.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book had my attention on the first page and held it till the last! Grisham skillfully weaves the ongoing trial preparation and trial with the background of all the characters and local town gossip. I loved this book.
0307120007|5.0|WOW! WHO DOES NOT REMEMBER &#34;PAT THE BUNNY&#34;.MY DAUGHTER IS 40 AND SHE STILL REMEMBERS IT BY HEART..SHE SAYS WHEN SHE HOLDS THE BOOK AND FEELS THE FUZZY TAIL,THAT SHE IS 3 AGAIN...THANKS! SHE SAYS SHE CAN RUB THE FUZZY TAIL ON HER FACE AND &#34;SMELL&#34; THE BOOK AND SHE IS IN HEAVEN!
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|When I first heard reflektor (the single) and then saw the SNL performance, I was thinking OMG what a disaster. Well I gave Reflektor a chance and it grew on me. I absolutely love Regine's vocals on it. She has some great songs with the band but these vocals might be tops.<br /><br />I downloaded the CDs last week and have given it a few listens and it has some strong points but also some major weaknesses.<br /><br />Lets talk about the strong points:<br />- I always appreciate a band who expands their sound and direction. AF do this here, whether you like it or not is a different story<br />- Some songs you don't like at first but they start to grab onto you after a few listens and you find your self bopping along to them.<br />- Regine's vocals<br /><br />Now the weaknesses:<br />- It is bloated. Think U2's POP. The lead track Refleckor is an extended version over the single and at times you are thinking \\"end the damn song already\\".<br />- Same can be said of some of the other songs, they don't know when to quit.<br />- Some songs are just plain boring especially on the second CD.<br /><br />And here is maybe the biggest problem. If you downloaded the CDs you prob did what I did. Change the song numbers on the second CD and make it into one big CD. Sort of a mistake and I might switch it back and split into two. Why? The first 7 songs (first CD) are actually pretty likeable. When you hit track 8 and beyond this collection becomes a collective bore except for maybe Afterlife. The last song Symmetry is just a waste of time. If they had just tacked Afterlife on as an 8th song and saved the other mess of songs as B-sides this would be a lot more likeable.<br /><br />So I think 3 stars is fair here. 4 stars on the first 7 songs and 1-2 stars on the next 6. Afterlife saves the second set of songs. I came here about to give the whole thing 2 stars but after considering the songs in two sets, CD1 and CD2, that is what I am trying to be fair on here.<br /><br />Fan boys and fan girls can tell me I just don't get ita nd it is album of the year. They would be wrong.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I love most of Tom Cruise's movies.  But most of all, it was a very excellent movie and action pack
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Since I am a fan of Jim Caviezel (Person of Interest) I watched this movie on the SyFy Channel to see him in a movie context. The movie is extremely well done and engaging. Caviezel does his usual fine job. This is a great Sci-Fi movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and the movie. can't wait fir catching fire. Love love love Suzanne Collins. MAKE more books
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great graphics,  not too easy but not too frustrating either.  Just hard enough but still enjoyable.  Great for all ages.
0694003611|5.0|ALL CHILDREN KNOE &#34;GOODNIGHT MOON&#34; BY HEART.SO NOW MY DAUGHTERS LOST COPY IS REPLACED AND SHE READS IT BY HERSELF,ON FULL MOON NIGHTS......WONDERFUL
B00499LTLM|5.0|This show is so amazing!<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman do an epic job of portraying Holmes and Watson. All three of the episodes are very good, but I think that the best episode of the three is \\"A study a pink.\\" It trumps the other two easily. Most pilot episodes for shows are lame, but this pilot episode is so good. I love it, and I highly recommend it.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|This is a good album.  She is a very creative artist and I just love jamming to her music anytime
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The most recent reboot of the Star Trek legacy has done an excellent job of putting a new spin on a time honored theme. If you are a Trekkie, it is interesting to note the similarities and departures. The concept of creating an &#34;alternate reality&#34; of the original Star Trek series is very effective and entertaining. If the writers continue to produce quality scripts, this version of Star Trek could easily exceed the original five-year mission.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is a great time waster! Its fun to play and has decent graphics. It also allows you to select the type of controls you want to use which is a nice touch.
B00E7SXNFU|5.0|I am a huge Nirvana fan. This was the first band that really hooked me. Other than the fact that this album is remastered, well that's the only reason I bought it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Really neat on your Kindle HD. More realistic than playing on your phone. Really enjoy watching them fall. And the direct hit.
B008JFUS28|5.0|Saw this tonight. Loved it. This is a wild, wild movie with standout action sequences to spare, especially involving Thor, Loki and Mjlonir hehe.  The film's not short on drama either although I wish we could have gotten a little more out of the budding Sif/Thor/Jane triangle. There's also some real heart-felt tragedy and a nice cliffhanger ending but I won't spoil anything.  Good stuff.  Real good stuff.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I love the mystery of it and how the movie flowed.  Jeremy Renner is a very good actor and I enjoy watching him.  His co-actor wasn't bad herself in this movie.  A good suspense movie to watch.  I would recommend it.
B004E547D8|5.0|This is an underrated movie. While I enjoy most of the Bruce Willis Die Hard movies, Red is more enjoyable than the most recent Die Hard entry. I ordered Red 2 (or whatever it's called) even though I know very little about it. I just assume that it will be as enjoyable as Red.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Basically, there is a rule in these ever-expanding parts: if Mitch wrote it, it's worth our time reading it. We love Mitch here in the Detroit area. We have for 20-some years. Even if it's a topic you're not interested in, Mitch has an insightful take on it and spins it into an enjoyable and/or important essay. The Time Keeper involves a topic we all have at least a casual interest in. And as usual Mitch tells it richly.
B00D9PUX5A|4.0|I listen to this album almost only when I work out. That's ok because I work out alot, but these guys make great heavy metal for making you push through the pain in the gym. I usually listen to music like this 1% of the time in my life, because it's hard to understand what they are saying, and mostly I don't like extreme heavy metal. But I love this band, especially for the gym. And this is the only Extreme Heavy Metal band I will listen too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was fun on my iPhone . So had to put it on my Kindle Fire HD. Fun game and the kids love playing it.
B008EL25LE|4.0|Fun game with puzzles and fun adventure story.  Not too challenging though. Good for time killing. Fun puzzle gaming for an afternoon or every now and then for a couple of weeks.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome. I have played SLENDERMAN CHAPTER ONE, but this is better than it. Get it! I also like how it is a free game.
B00CL151G4|5.0|Sherlock Holmes has returned with a vengeance during the last few years. British TV series, movies (Robert Downey Jr.) and now Lucy Liu and Johnny Lee Miller in a really well done TV series. I was skeptical when I saw the previews before the series premiered, but this has turned out to be a superb TV series. The dynamic between Watson and Holmes is perfect and the ensemble cast does a great job.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan  writes and I can't put the book down. This is one of her best stories. Worth the wait!
B00007E8O5|5.0|I bought this album back in 2003 and enjoyed it a bit, listened to it and forgot about it. I only like maybe half of the album and that was it. Well, I came back to this album recently and was instantly hooked. I suppose my musical tastes have changed, but this is an absolute gem, a hidden gem. Bargain Basement, Pig Charmer and Castaway are some of my favorites, but there are many many more great ones.<br /><br />Now, his first album The Boggy Depot I also own. At first I liked that album a lot years ago when I used to listen to it. I recently came back to it as well, and I couldn't stand it. One or two songs and that was it, totally different than this album.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Gotta have it. LOL. It's a daily thing. How can ya go with out it. I would go nutts. 2 thumbs up.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Have always liked Eminem and his style, lyrics and beats.  Not to mention his rhyming styling.  i felt that he went a little \\"soft\\"  with Encore as well as after that.  Not that it is a bad thing, but personally I like his raps to be a little more deep and edgy.  This album isn't filth, not sexual, doesn't have a ton of profanity.  Nor does it have over the top shock factor.  It's just real.  One thing I noticed about this album is the way he changes styles within the song.  Not something you have heard too much before. Rap God is a good example. Definitely a rollercoaster in each song. Got to love the song where he uses samples from The Zombies, and another one from Joe Walsh.  Played them for my 61 year old dad and he was shocked how well it was done.  Best overall album from start to beginning I have heard in a decade.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Love anything with Bruce Springsteen in the title, can never have too much Bruce!! Counting the days to February 26th to see Bruce do it all over again
B00CL0J99K|5.0|The Iron Man Series is fantastic! Although I was never a fan of Robert Downey Jr., he is perfectly cast as Iron Man (and as Sherlock Holmes in his recent movies). Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle complete a superb ensemble cast. I am eagerly waiting for Iron Man IV and the next Avengers installment.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Another great album by Eminem. Although not a big fan of him as a person, I do enjoy listening to his music and he has not lost his touch. At a time when people like jay-z, kanye west, nas and so many other, older rappers have lost the capacity to put out great music, Eminem puts them all to shame and simply put, continues to make fantastic music.
B005OSUL9I|5.0|Netrebko and Garanca are Excellent singing. This Disk is first-class Blu-ray productions. The Deutsche Grammochon is also a good brand.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|The game is legit I can't believe the graphics in this game this game is addicting once you get good your the champion
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I am not a musician. In fact, I was discouraged from learning music as  child, much to my sadness and disappointment. With Pianist I now get a late in life chance to play the piano. I don't know anything about pitch and tones. All I know is that with this app. I finally feel as if I'm really playing the piano! It's good fun. I love it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is an amazing book that has a really cool story line. I really recommend that you read this book.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|NCIS LA Has been a great spin off from the very first episode. Since I am a fan of the Original NCIS, it was a given that I would check out this new series. The ensemble cast is perfect. The plots are first rate. And while it is consistent with the original NCIS, NCIS Los Angeles puts a unique spin on its plots and focus--less forensics and more action. I am currently working my way through Season 2.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I'm a big fan of One Republic and I purchased the Target exclusive version of this CD, although the regular one is still great as well. From beginning to end you see that this group still has it and years after breaking through with their first hit song, they still have plenty of hits.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Excellent quality backpack. Plenty of room for the starting photographer. Compact and comfortable design. The best to take your DSLR camera everywhere.
034580404X|5.0|I have fallen in LUV wit Christian Gray....wish I was Anastasia Steele. If u haven't read all 3, better get on em
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is such a d fun game, I haven't found any glitches or problems. The graphics are great and I really have a lot of fun playing the game.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|This is just not a good movie. Which is sad cuz its Brad Pitt and I really like zombie movies. But the story line and how they did everything was just not very good. I think it could have been made much better.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book literally is one of the best I have ever read. Couldn't put it down, had to keep reading.
B000267JQK|5.0|When does Seether not put out anything that's awesome? Their music rocks and this is a hard hitting album that will not disappoint fans.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I am amazed at the journalistic skills of this young lady. She not only tells her story of the shooting but goes into great detail about the history, culture, and geography of her country.  Her strength and bravery is also evident in her writings.  I wish all of our young people would read her book just to gain the inspiration it offers.  She is truly a remarkable young woman.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome because,You can do multiplayer,mine,fight monsters,build house's and so much more. Another cool thing is that Mojang, the creators of minecraft, do awesome updates on this game about every four months!!!!
B007CKX8GY|1.0|After the first fifty pages I just put it down and went to find something else to do.  Boring, tedious, and ridiculous.  Poor writing with nothing of interest to it.<br /><br />As one other reviewer said of the story line after fifty pages:  \\"Oh, Jayzuz, Daddy's drunk yet again.\\"<br /><br />Honestly, save your money and buy something by Thomas Merton.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Still missing other apps to cast. It doeas what it says, but could be better. Very easy to install and use.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Without telling the plot of the movie so as not to spoil it for people that haven't yet seen it, I thought it started as a cheap movie for an actor with the caliber of Denzel Washington. I thought, this is it, he's washed up! I was wrong, just like the pilot was wrong to be flying in his condition. But if not for his condition, the flight probably would not have ended up so favorable. Just like Denzel's porformance, honorable...Great movie!
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I've been listening to August Burns Red for several years now and I love this album. They keep churning out hard rocking tracks and their signature sound continues on this album.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It is hard to write a review to capture the emotions I feel after finishing this book.  I am still wiping tears, but feeling the heavy satisfaction that the ending was a good one.  Allegiant brings the factions together in a way that feels so true for today's world.  The book makes it easy to identify with the characters, and feel the emotions they feel.  When I read books, I want to feel like I know the people I'm reading about.  They become a family of sorts in my mind.  This definitely happened with Allegiant.  I was happy for their successes and cried for their losses.  At the end of the day, I'm ready to let the characters from the Divergent series move on with their lives, and trust that they will be okay no matter what life throws at them.  That, to me, is what makes a good series awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the game play and difficulty. Could possibly be my best game of all time with the facebook help from friends and all.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Pretty cool game. I like breaking the web's and strong the bugs free. And watching them fly away from the spider to freedom.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|i love il divo. they are my favorite group. each cd gets better and better. i buy all their new cds.
1250038820|5.0|Stunningly compelling, like the Facebook and other feed versions. HONY is something to look forward to every day. And the book contains many of the best excerpts. It puts a more human face on NY, a city I and millions of others love, but that many others don't understand.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|I bought the exclusive Target deluxe edition of this CD and I love it. Even if you get the regular version of this Cd you're going to enjoy all the tracks on this album. I still like her earlier pop oriented music, but this album was still great.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|My problem with this app is that with each level there is no instruction for it. By the time you figure  it out you have used up all moves  and  or time. It just gets confusing sometimes. .thank you Georgette
0307887448|4.0|Good writing.  Intriguing gamer story.  A little YA-ish.  I'd read more..... wish you'd spend less time with fantastic geeky toys and more time writing....
1454704225|4.0|A copy was provided in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Craft-A-Doddle is the perfect exercise book for those who want to learn different techniques and styles using pen, pencil, watercolor and more! As someone who always has trouble drawing cute faces, I found the &#34;Recipe for a Face&#34; section very helpful and has given me the tips I desperately needed. Some of the more complicated drawings can be a little more vague in their instructions, but nonetheless this book is filled with visual inspiration that does wonders to encourage you to attempt doodling every single piece! A great artsy gift for a friend!
B005LAII12|4.0|very cute adult movie. found it sad in parts but very cute adult movie. ould not reccomend this for kids.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Totally fun and increasingly challenging.  I only hold back on five stars because I despise free games where you get stuck and can only proceed if you put up cash.  That said, if you can wait, they do let you continue
B003O85W3A|5.0|When has Arcade Fire failed to disappoint? This album is great, as usual, and once you finish listening to the album you'll want to listen to it again. Truly a great band, Arcade Fire keeps bringing great music to their fans.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Very deep and an excellent story in a way that kept you constantly interested and surprised to the very end.
0756407915|5.0|Oh man, who can put this down?  I am there, in the Inn, listening to Kvothe tell his story.  This is the kind of book that you hope never ends, or that you hope the author is prolific.  I saw you, Rothfuss, on Wheaton's TableTop.  I bought your books, now I need you to be writing more things for me to read!  (Feel like GRRMartin? You are right up there!) Next book! Next book! Next book!
B001HDWKMA|5.0|Original, inspired, artistic, innovative... Just beautiful and emotionally touching. Ray LaMontagne is so inspired. I loved Ray's album Trouble, and found this album did not disappoint as well.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Beautiful story that will both warm and crush your heart. A very real interpretation of life in WWII Germany told from the most unique perspective of Death.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Good Movie, Good Entertainment  and it was worth the money. Price was right due to prepay deal. Everybody in the family liked it !!
B00280LYIC|5.0|The Lightning Thief is an incredible start to Percy's journey. The book itself keeps your attention in jaw-dropping sequence of heroic events, but still manages to be humorous and educational. Throughout the book you experience twist after turn, making you want more greek mythology.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I love this series. I started with one episode and I am absolutely hooked. Must see! You really come to care about the characters in the story and want to know what happens to them on their own personal journeys.
0756404746|5.0|Loved it!  Couldn't put it down!  This is the kind of book you wish would never end, and this is the kind of author that, after discovering, you wish had written hundreds of books that you haven't discovered yet.<br />More!  More!  More!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for the game on kindle. It's creative and figuring out the secret moves is the best part
B008JFUO72|5.0|Great movie!!!!!!  Great Movie if you enjoy Iron Man a must have.Just love the Iron Man series and this one did not dissapoint
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game!! super fun! I absolutely adore my horse her name is Beauty and she is so cuteand I love her
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I Liked the way it builds in difficulty and at the same time shows how to play. game Graphics and sounds are fun
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Not long enough.But for free,, who is complaining?  It's very cute.  Animation is very good. Give him more to do.
B008P9M614|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my Nephew.  It's one of his favorite shows.  He says it's interesting, never boring, has good story lines and a cast that fits together well.
1250030951|4.0|OVERALL IMPRESSION: I really enjoyed reading this. I fell in love with the story, the characters, everything. I felt super warm and fuzzy and happy after finishing this book. This story connects with me and how my college days were. I was also the girl who just wanted to stay in her room and was afraid to venture outside of my comfort zone. I really enjoyed reading about Cath and the way she changed and learned to give new experiences a chance before shutting them out completely.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: My favorite character is Levi. His character is just so awesome. He's always there for his friends with no questions asked and he's so nice to everyone.<br /><br />COVER: I think the cover is cute and sums up the book pretty well. I like the simplicity of it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I don't know where to start, or end for that matter. It may not be a book everyone can swallow, but my mind has never been more open. Wow....
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't really like this app but it works! Not bad not good. You will probably like it I use it a lot. My mom and aunt have it on their phones. They like it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Sick and tired of being sick and tired? Want to get off of or stay of of harsh medication? Willing to do anything to better you health/life? Read this book. It is jammed pack with knowledge of how our diet directly affects our health. Explains the medical side of the story without being overly technical. This book might be the closest advice to the fountain of youth.
B0024RID6U|5.0|This is a great old record.  Almost all of the tracks are very simple rock classics.  Black Limousine? Come on. What more do you need?
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This was a good show.  At first I didn't think, I'm a little particular about King Arthur but it came together and worked well.
0373771665|5.0|My very favorite Heyer! It fairly crackles with sexuality. The characters are engaging and the dialogue is hilarious. Why hasn't anyone made movies of her books?
0316069434|5.0|I've read all of Michael Connelly's novels. This one ranks right up there with his best. Nice to see how he's handling Bosch and his teenage daughter as she matures. Hopefully, Connelly will continue to develop this storyline. Looking forward to his next and his next!
B00DZJ82W6|5.0|5.1 remaster is sublime. Attention surround sound fans, you will love this one. The surround mix is NOT passive--the rears are used extensively, especially for the horns. It reminds me of the surround mix for Honky Chateau. With sky high prices for surround material this blu ray 5.1 is a bargain.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|This movie, for me, was truly frightening. It held my attention the entire time and I didn't find myself wanting to finish a chore in the middle of it like I usually do with other movies.
B008JFUS28|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect with Thor: The Dark World. I loved the first film to pieces and really thought it couldn't get better than that.<br /><br />Well, it did.<br /><br />It completely surpassed my expectations and was probably the most fun I've had watching a Marvel movie since The Avengers; and even though I really liked Iron Man 3, Thor was easily the better movie of the two. The cast is once again fantastic, but I'm going to single out Tom Hiddleston in particular. God, he's just so perfect for Loki. He gives him the perfect balance.: Not too jovial, yet not the Ultimate Master of Evil either. I see Loki as the 10-year-old in a man's body kind of thing and Hiddleston pulls it off extremely well.<br /><br />There's a little more humor weaved into the story this time, which can be both great and a drag at the same time. I felt like the quips in the first half of the film were well-placed and entertaining, but during the second half, it felt like humor was just thrown in there to be funny, though I will admit that I thought all scenes with Stellan Skarsgard were fantastic.<br /><br />The pacing is a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, I thought it was a pretty well-paced movie. The beginning is a little slow, but quickly picks up, so the viewer won't really have time to be bored. Another thing that I really appreciated was the fact that the writers were able to stay focused on the main plot. That was one *huge* problem with Iron Man 3 that I failed to realize until I was watching The Dark World in the theater earlier today. As  much as I love Shane Black's work; Drew Pearce should've stopped him and told him to slow down a little. The characters don't need to be doing 75 different things at one time. People won't be bored by them just doing a couple things at once, it makes the story flow so much better.<br /><br />As mentioned, the cast is great and all seem to have great chemistry with each other. The only new character that bugged me was Darcy's intern.<br /><br />So, if you enjoyed the first film, see this for sure. Some may not enjoy that there's more humor, but the overall pace and dedication to the plot makes up for the cheesy humor in the second half. It's fun, entertaining and a great way to spend 2 hours of your day!
B0055D3EOG|4.0|A very good storyline.  This is definitely more a ghost story and not a gore fest.  The ending will make you want to see the next one, as you are left deliciously hanging...
B000BTC5LW|5.0|they rock. well made, great sound. I can never get enough when i first bought it and the price was fair.
B005CRY2O6|5.0|This is a beautiful book with fresh, easy recipes which will add life to any dinner party. It is easy to present beautiful dishes to guests.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A story of tremendous heart that heals and fills and pushes out, demanding to not be forgotten and instantly adored.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I usually don't read Young Adult books but the reviews I read on this book convinced me to try it.<br /><br />In short, it was a great book. The characters brought me back to all the warm and fuzzy feelings I had when I was a teenager and in love. Yes, the story is destined to have a sad ending. C'mon, they both have cancer. But it's not only about that. It's the hope and the gift of life that you WANT to gift these young kids who are so in love.<br /><br />It's reading about how much they wish things were different.  It's about how &#34;I&#34; wished things were different for them. And for me, that's what a great book is all about. It draws you in and makes you laugh, cry and hope WITH the characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it!!! You get to build whatever you want!Also,you can have a pet a gift shop a science lab!For me it's a 10 star
030788743X|5.0|When I finished this book, I was immediately sucked into our on-campus game (at Kansas State University) that was based directly on Ready Player One. The book had been chosen as our University Common Read for the 2013-2014 school year which prompted my wife and I to pick it up and read it in the first place as both staff and students at the university.<br /><br />I loved the book itself from the outset. As a child who grew up in the 70's and 80's (only a year younger than the author,) I experienced first hand many of the things that the book touches on. But beyond mere nostalgia, this book really hit me right in my wheel-house. I related well to the characters and I thought that the story-line was both interesting and action-packed enough to keep my attention from page one on through the conclusion.<br /><br />Anyone who's interested in the origins and evolution of video gaming, 80's films and pop-culture, and/or Dungeons & Dragons should give this book a shot. Both my wife and I, who have very different tastes liked the book fairly equally.<br /><br />What really sealed the deal though, was the almost two months of on-campus game play. Solving puzzles, going on scavenger hunts and competing in our own Robot War card game tournament while making new friends with all of the other on-campus \\"gunters\\" was pretty fantastic. Wrapping it all up was a packed-house (1500+) talk by the author followed by a book signing at which I talked with Mr. Cline and walked away with a fist bump after being told that we were his \\"kind of people.\\" All in all, a great experience.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am enjoying this game along with my daughter.  Not as challenging as some similar games I've played, but just enough to be fun.  It's free, so expect ads.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great for Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play Movies. Casting a tab in Chrome works great from my new Mac, but is choppy on my old, slow Mac. Despite that problem, I prefer the Chromecast over Roku and Apple TV.

B00FPGSPQU|3.0|After Part 2 you should know better than to expect too much from characters that should have been retired at the end of the first movie. But if you choose to solider on to the, look for John Goodman and Ken Jeong do all the heavy lifting. Of course, it wouldn't be hangover movie if Justin Bartha wasn't on screen for ten minutes and speaking for only five.<br /><br />If you've made through Part 1 and Part 2, you might as well finish the trilogy.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love dinosaurs. Build the park the way you want. Would be nice to earn more cash on quest or survey crews
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very useful, clever and inexpensive product. Great for YouTube casting, sharing a big screen is always better than watching videos on a small smartphone display.
B00A2H9PLG|5.0|Item was exactly what I needed.  I am very pleased with it and would get it again if I had to.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I loved the way the books look and I can see the cover unlike on my kindle.  I will be using this app a lot.
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Excellent book! I started reading and can't stop. I'm learning a lot of different concepts and seeing people in a different way.
006202406X|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book. I loved the first two and had such high expectations for the finale to the story. I pictured such an exciting and hopeful ending. This one really missed the mark.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I normally don't like Zombie movies. But this is not your normal Zombie movie and I really liked it. This is more of an action thriller to me. In 3D it made me jump a couple times. It doesn't have the blood and gore of typical Zombie movies, which is why I don't like those types, but liked this movie.
B000FC11JW|4.0|This was good but I have not had the time to search through it in order to dig out what can be useful for me.  When time allows this reading will be a priority.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|This CD does not contain songs that are as good as earlier ones.  However, I am glad that I purchased it.
B00E9A656K|4.0|this game is fun but why is there gas that wastes your time? you people got to take away the gas process, or you should make it 5 silver coins
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Great special effects.  So much better than Transfromers. Action packed, keeps you at the edge of your seat.<br />So glad I bought it.
B00936A2SM|5.0|So, the first Jeff Berlin album I got hip to back in mid 80's was Vox Humana. It was the first time I heard Scott Henderson. I was like \\"WOW\\" This is some amazing stuff! Jeff to me is kind of like Jack Bruce on steroids, in his own way, but definitely the flavor. I have seen Hendrix 5 times, Zappa , probably 50 or more times, Jeff Beck, SRV, Mahavishnu,Van HAlen,  you name them, Ive seen most everybody.<br /><br />But man, that album really turned my head. It was SO different. Shortly after that, I got to see Jeff's band at Hop Singh's in Santa Monica. When I went, Scott had left the band and been replaced by none other than Frank Gambale, who totally blew my mind also.<br />I spoke with Frank after the show and he suggested I enroll at GIT. The following year I did and got to see Scott Henderson Gary Willis Frank Gambale Jeff Berlin and a plethera of other great great musicians all the time, and take classes from them as well.<br />Since then I have followed all these guys through the years, I own almost everything Scott has done, alot of what Jeff has done, and so many things with Dennis on them from Tower of Power to big band to Scofield to funk-Parliament and these three guys are some of my absolute most favorite musicians on the planet.<br /><br />First of all, nobody gets tone like Scott Henderson. The wild choking the s*** out of the notes, while delivering incredibly thoughtful, tasteful lines, sheer speed with Jeff Beck type artistry with the whammy bar, is incomparable.  Jeff's tone-come on-it is to die for. The authority in Jeff's playing is so amazing. He holds it down and plays groove, solos like a mo fo' and is the glue between these other two fabulous players. Dennis Chambers is probably my favorite drummer in the world. The dude is so funky, holds it down, has chops like nobody's business. He is one of those guys that when I hear him on anything, I can pretty much always tell its him because of his signature style.<br />The interplay between these incredible musicians is akin to Cream at the peak of their career. The vibe and the magic shared between these players, just doesn't come along very often. The choice to take songs that were written by other greats like Weather Report and the like and to do them \\"Their Way\\" just helps to spotlight the creativity and artistry of HBC.<br />So, avail yourself of this GREAT CD. I hope this review was helpful to you.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It keeps closing when I try to connect it to Facebook. I don't want to have to start over!! It needs to sync with ny phone
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv,  if not THE  best.  The writing, plot, pace and characters are exceptional... except for last season's weird Kalinda sideline.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A nice balance of philosophy and more down-to-earth topics around physiology and practical running topics.  I get lost in this book and don't want to put it down. It constantly reminds me of why I love running so much and makes me want to get to be able to run an ultra; what an experience...<br /><br /> I love this book and if you love running, you will too.  I move between being fascinated on an intellectual-basis and moved to tears on shear emotion.  I bought the book on the recommendation of The Oatmeal after reading his excellent essay &#34;The Terrible and Wonderful Reasons why I Run Long Distances&#34;. I love that essay and have re-read it many times so i figured, &#34;why not&#34; and took his recommendation and bought Born to Run.  Definitely not disappointed.<br /><br />Buy this book, right now... do it... stop reading this and buy it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a very good game but I don't like the pop up adds for additional games. * * *
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie has an original premise, a glossy attractive presentation, and a strong cast- which draws you in. In particular, the clever publicity trailer draws you in!<br /><br />It's a good movie to buy on DVD, as a second viewing helps you to unravel the plot twists- mostly, they're logical, but sometimes dealt with obscurely. I see that they have released an extended version on DVD,which is 9 minutes longer- I haven't seen that version, but I suggest you buy that, as the cinema release version shows evidence of cutting which I suspect inhibited the plot exposition.<br /><br />The story is about magicians, greed, retribution and moral justice. To some extent, I thought the movie's style and gloss triumphed over the substance.<br /><br />The cast try hard, with a script which starts out well, and has some ingenious twists, but which had an ending denouement which I thought could have been stronger and more convincing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the end of the film implies that there will be a sequel. Indeed, I understand that planning for a sequel has commenced.<br /><br />Is it a great movie? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes, and I enjoyed the good- and sometimes clever- parts enough to outweigh the weaker and less convincing elements. The characters and storyline have an appeal which draws you in.<br /><br />Would I watch a sequel? Probably...
1478978082|5.0|I listened to this heart thumping book on CD clearly narrated by Michael McConnohie without missing a word or loosing my attention. Harry is back(which makes me out to be a true pessimist since I thought the author had done away with the old Harry)and better than ever. If you think you can listen to this book on CD and fall asleep...think again.<br /><br />This is the story of revenge, morals and motivation. All 3 wrapped up spells Harry Bosch.<br /><br />Connolly has re-won my respect as one of our all time great authors.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This was such a great feel-good movie. It took a few turns that I hadn't predicted. I absolutely fell in love with Steve Carrell's character. He was so vulnerable and adorable and sexy all wrapped up into one. LOVE LOVE LOVE Ryan Gosling's protectiveness and determination for Steve Carrell's character even when being attacked by him and his patience with him both at the beginning of their friendship and toward the end of the movie. Emma Stone is as adorable as always!<br /><br />I'm not a big reviewer here, but this movie really touched me. It had a few love stories going on at once and each character was so endearing (even Kevin Bacon) that I was rooting for all of them, even though they couldn't all win in the end.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Beautiful gorgeous movie . Story is AMAZING and the graphics are just as amazing as the story itself , its touching and moving and by the end of the movie you feel as though you have learned a life lesson . Wont Spoil it but this movie is a must and especially in blue ray to enjoy those crisp graphics and vibrant colors I only wish I had seen this movie in 3d because it shows how gorgeous it would have been in 3d as well .
B00B19H2KU|4.0|Scary, Very Very Scary; this will make you think twice about buying any strange looking wooden boxes at a garage sale.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Has lots of stuff and very helpful for homework (there is a free one too)<br />To use so I rated this a 5star
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Warm, heart-touching movie that made me laugh & cry, it was a truly touching tale on how much an animal can love it's human.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I am impressed the other version of real steel wasn't very good then update  it and added a few more robots but it was still pretty boring. Then a few months later they came out with this and it just flows very nicely but all in all very good very addicting very nice but anyway it's a really good game and you should get it
B003US028O|3.0|The audio quality is flawless, and the packaging is all top-notch... the run-out groove even has some nifty little illustrations etched into it, showcasing the care that Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab put into this 180-gram vinyl release. Unfortunately, the album contains the original USA tracklisting -- omitting \\"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\\" and \\"Night Rally\\", both of which were taken off the record back in the 70's for being \\"too British\\". Instead, the record includes \\"Radio, Radio\\". It's really quite a shame -- \\"Radio, Radio\\" is a wonderful rant of a single, but ultimately this release does not include all of the songs on the actual album.<br /><br />This review is specific to the vinyl release, as far as I'm aware all CD releases have all 12 tracks from the album AND \\"Radio, Radio\\".
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Amazing art in game form , this collection is worth the money 20 bucks for 2 games its an amazing deal . Its an HD collection but the graphics look amazing and better than they did in the Ps2 . Storys are touching and at points sad . Scenery is gorgeous and artistic . If you were a fan of games such as Journey than you will love this collection .<br /><br />Its a game that shows Art is very much in every game from character design to back drops to stories .
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great story. Lots of twists and turns that I never expected. The epilogue was great. I would definitely recommend to friends.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Great Movie!!! Fun, full of life, great acting. It's a gotta own. Audrey Tautou in her break out role which sets the tone of her career.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I agree with what most people say about this book. After I finished reading it I did feel this hollowness inside. After finishing Insurgent over a year ago I was so immersed in this series. The cliffhanger at the end drove me absolutely nuts and I loved the sudden twist with the Edith Prior stuff and all the mystery behind that. With that said, I could not wait for this book to come out. However, after reading it I was left with this emptiness. I felt like this book had almost nothing to do with the other 2 books. I didn't like how Chicago was brushed to the side and we didn't really get to see any resolution there due to the whole genetic madness. Oh and speaking of the genetic stuff, I HATED IT! The whole &#34;genetically pure&#34; and &#34;genetically damaged&#34; thing was SO frustrating. For a futuristic world that is supposed to be very advanced I thought the people of beyond the fence were SO ignorant. I thought the whole concept of genetics is already well understood in our time now how do these people not have any scientific articles to reference to? I was so sad after what happened at the end. It left me in an ocean of tears. I don't necessarily agree with the ending but in a way I do understand it. It was not the worst book I've ever read, it only took me a couple days and that's only because college gets in the way. However, I wish it could have been better. I wanted a huge plot twist that was going to send our mind spinning. But oh well, can't have everything you want. Whoever has read Divergent and Insurgent should definitely read Allegiant, because, ya know, it's the last book in the series.
B00CIXVAN8|1.0|Impossible to rate since I never recieved this movie. I must say trying to get it after. The fact and having already paid for this item is very frustrating, not to mention the sill rules about this rating site.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Scary , bloody and creepy , and yes at points it seven sad . This remake out does the original in many ways , but im also a fan of remakes , nothing against the originals I like remakes . Without spoiling there was moment in the movie I felt sad for the characters and the horrific things happening to them . Its a great Scary movie with more thrills than getting you to jump in fear although it does that too and very well .
B008JFUO72|5.0|Out of the trilogy of iron Man movies this was the best one I have purchased.Then the first movie ranks number two and the second is the last out of the three installments.
0590259385|5.0|This series is very enjoyable to all my family.  The rhyming is fun and the stores are enjoyable. you want to read it over and over again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We just couldn't wait until it came out on Netflix so we bought the season.<br />Can't wait for Season 4 to start.<br />Season 3 was awesome. The best yet.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|As the name implies; FLICK EXTREME GOLF,is \\"Extremely Awesome! It has; Extreme Powerhouse ball striking capabilities,Extreme graphics, and Extreme ball flight control, which means you can \\"draw, or fade a shot, depending on what you are trying to achieve. Whether you're hitting from a huvering helicopter to  a target on the upper deck of aircraft carrier, or you're hitting from the top of skyscraper to a target in the middle old a swimming pool, on another skyscraper hundreds of yards away; or you might be hitting from a rooftop somewhere in France,to a target atop a floating ferrieboat,in which you have to hit your shot out wide and draw it back with the tip of your finger. In each scenario, hole in one's are very makeable if; you know your stuff!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|A good app, easy to use, seems to do a nice job.  Good interface, I think it did speed up my kindle.
1844137872|5.0|Awesome book! AND I bought it before Banksy did his Tour of NYC, the lowest price more than doubled last month! They're moving copies like \\"limited edition\\" Hostess(R) Twinkies(TM)!
B00004RJ71|5.0|This is a phenomenal movie! I had seen this movie various times when I was younger, that it was scratched!! I had to purchase this movie again and no matter how many times I watch, I am hooked to Paco, and all the characters intense lives!
B00873GRU4|2.0|Starts with a hiss and a roar and then the story tappers off and fails to gain momentum after that. A very interesting scenario however but I would not recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very happy with this product, can't wait for more services to be added but does what it does very well.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The beauty of the performances speaks for itself. Performances for this anniversary cast were the best I have heard.<br />Bravo.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It is  beyond a doubt one of the easiest and most useful office apps there is on the kindle fire.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I gravitated to this book because of the plot. This book has a REAL ending. Not your typical love story, which i loved!!!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|This is for the teenage girl who loves twillight but with the roles reversed. If you're a hopeless romantic girl, this ones for you. Teenager fans of sci fi, fans of justin bieber, or just love fun movies, this is it. The southern acting is a bit bad, but if you're not from the south you won't notice!
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. Could use a trilogy here. I found myself wanting to know what next? I think Halo 4in the title is misleading. It would be better to drop the number as I think this is the first film for this. Anyways I recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Lots of fun levels and enjoyment for the whole family!<br /><br />My only issue is the tilting of the nabi doesn't work for the , slides, fluffy unicorn, and gru's rocket.... works on my iphone but not on.nabi?..please fix this issue with an update!
B000I186FW|5.0|Remember remember the 5th of November. Rise up sheeple. Our government and so called leaders are  tyrants. Wake up and see.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|Tough to beat OEM quality.  This products is meeting my expectations.  It looks nice and fits the HTC One.  The phone does sit a little loose when in the case.  So this case isn't made for people who are prone to dropping their phones, or chucking it around.
0399256385|5.0|The Spot books are wonderfully designed to make reading easy and interesting. Kids love lifting the flaps and colorful characters. I recommend purchasing this book for a fun reading experience.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Great CD Eminem is legend and never seems to let me down I would tell anybody and everybody to buy this CD
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|Honestly, I recently just discovered Mr. Glasper's work within the last year or so. I am truly impressed. I went back and purchased most of his albums. This is a great followup to &#34;Black Radio&#34; and Black Radio EP. Keep up the great work!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love the graphics and fun to play. Easy controls make is even more fun. I recommend this game to anyone who likes hunting games.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|All I can say is that this is a excellent novel that I will never forget.  12 Years as a slave is a good follow up.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Marvel's The Avengers (HD).  It's fun, funny and thrilling. Stan Lee's  characters (Ironman, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow,  have leaped off their comic book pages and onto our hi definition televisions, hurling lighting bolts, tanks, and quick one-liners at each other faster than the speed of light.  The dialogue was full of witty repartee, especially from Robert Downing Jr's &#34;Tony Stark/Iron Man&#34; character.  Everyone did a great acting job, and I look forward to watching the next Avengers DVD.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|This is a great app, however there are currently some incompatibilities with the new Nexus 5.  After installation, I am unable to add any widgets to the home screens, I receive the message \\"Unfortunately Google Search has stopped\\".  Uninstalling CalenGoo fixes the issue.  Reinstalling it brings it back.

0060594896|5.0|Very good book!! I have not finished it yet but the few chapters I've read really make you understand why you are where you are and most importantly, ideas and exercises on how to get you started on your goals. Is a great eye-opener and you may find a lot to gain from this book.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|a one trick pony! this is a joke when it can only stream netflix and you tube only! my tv is smarter than this.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|Great Movie, my son loves and it's a guilty pleasure for me too. AND you can NOT go wrong with a Digital Copy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Hmmm. I'm having mixed emotions. It's great! I can stream Pandora to my TV with chromecast, wait i can already do that with my sony Blu Ray. It sucks! It makes You Tube full screen if I use the chrome browser... not a lot of value added there. On the plus side, I can mirror my laptop to my tv using chrome. Set up is easy and intuitive. I have not taken the device on a business trip yet...
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|Very Refreshing and original. Wasn't sure the first time I listened to all the songs, but the more I played it I became mesmerized.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Martins' writing is pictorial - fuels imagination to travel to a new mental level of excitement with enjoyment. Madness behind the myth is explained. Regardless, whether you have seen the TV drama or not, the journey is intimate with new facts being revealed as you read further. Buy yourself to a ticket on an exciting journey...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I resisted playing for a very long time, but then got sucked in on our last road trip. I play and my children play. My husband acts like he doesn't want to play, but I can tell he really does. Lol<br />Lots of fun when you have some free time!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|this is a fun mahjong game. There are plenty of challenging designs to work from and will give you hours of entertainment.
B00005OBSD|4.0|Early stuff, a but more raw, interesting in that it shows glimmers of what would come later. Great classic rock.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Take your time with this game. There is no instant gratification like other games. It's meant to be played over a longer period of time. Go through the Gameloft site<br />and make as many friends as possible to earn your heart gems. Those will help you earn plays through the balloon pop game for the pink gems that are the rare ones. Don't waste them skipping tasks or building, they're hard to get. The glitches that frustrate me are the mini games that glitch at the end and don't count the points. It tends to happen more on new stars. Wastes my bits. Other than that, I like all the MLP characters that are included in this game.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Some might suggest that having different actors play the young Kirk and Spock is akin to heresy.  I would totally disagree, these guys knocked it out of the park.  The special effects are great.  Pure escapism in its best form.  So much better than most of the pap n theaters today.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|Fascinating story of the occult with a really great actor.<br />I think Depp is one of the most versatile actors of all time.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|My Dragon vale reset after I got the update . I had an Amber Dragon and I never got it back after that update. So if u update it there's a chance u will lose EVERYTHING.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Can only go so far in this game and friends have to give me a ticket for the train and kingdom.com doesn't support Facebook friends,so why play on.
B008K8VDPU|1.0|Paid for everything, all upgrades.  Install new upgrade, all purchased content GONE, ADS ARE BACK!  Wrote publisher about problem, couldn't be bothered to reply.  Avoid.  Will change review if publisher makes good.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|One say &#34;it is easier to talk about their sex life at work than talking about gender discrimination. ..&#34; This is a quote from this book. Absolutely loved this book. All people should read this. Women and men.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Really good I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Greek mythology. If you like an interesting book that is action packed and full of humour.
B005HSL626|5.0|The kids love this games.  It is fun for the whole family.  (Which is hard to find now-a-days)!  Also, you can't beat FREE!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it soooo much . You get stuck on a level tor so long but I is worth it.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great series!! Love the drama, actors do an execellent job of pulling you in and sharing emotions with the characters.
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|I was concerned this LEGO set might be too small to provide much entertainment, so we purchased it with another of the LEGO Minecraft kits for my 6 year old (who is very good with Lego, even the very tiny bits) - I need not have worried. He loves it, but of course 2 is better than 1!<br />I do wish it was a bit less expensive, but of course Minecraft is HUGE with the kids these days, and demand = inflated prices.
0061122416|5.0|Had to buy this book for school for one of my classes. Didn't think I was going to like it (as with most school books) but turned out to be one of my favorites! Great read!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The prose and the images conjured are vivid. The insights into the trials and tribulation through choices made or circumstances thrust upon us are equally enlightening. A very enjoyable and uplifting tale winding through many lives and generations.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME YOU SHOULD GET THIS APP THERE'S A THEAM SONG AND SO MANY PEOPLE but this game is easier if u have a sencer phone
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It worked with YouTube and pandora , delivery to Australia was expensive but I am happy enough with it thanks
B009LDCZDC|5.0|Excellent series. Had missed some chapters and wanted to see the second season before the third season began.  Was worth it!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I am eleven years old and at first, from the looks of the cover, I thought this movie would be boring and out dated. However, after watching it with my mom, this movie turned out to be better than I expected. It was funny, touching, and relevant despite the production date. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys offbeat, darkly humorous, and heartfelt stories. Five stars. ( first time commenter. YAY!)
B00F2LKJ4Y|1.0|The description for the instant version states Format: Amazon Instant Video (streaming online video and digital download)<br />After you've purchased it, it says, because of licensing agreement, the movie can't be streamed and can only be downloaded.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Coming up on 1200 reviews here alone, there's not much I can say that hasn't been said before.  People keep describing this book as \\"light\\" \\"nonsense\\" etc using these terms as if they are bad things.  Like, read it if you MUST, but of course it is only light and entertaining.<br />Let me tell you something. I suffer from PTSD and I am really sick of the current trend in novels where every novel revolves around some gruesome horrible event and its aftermath.  I'm stuck with reading cookbooks or chick lit, and I really do not care for chick lit.<br />It is a breath of fresh air to get to a novel like this that is nearly 400 pages and doesn't rely on anything 'shocking' to grip the reader.  I was absolutely delighted with this book and am so grateful to Jonas Jonasson.

B00CW7KK9K|1.0|This gizmo has super cool features and great potential, HOWEVER, I had mine less than 24 hours and it is not working right. For one thing, the time is stuck on January 2001 with no way to reset it. I tried following instructions from tech support, but when I did that, it disconnected my account and there is no way to get a new password sent. Check their FaceBook support page before buying. PLEASE!  What you will find is that the customer service is dismal and the number of help tickets has them swamped. This is a great device that has some big problems and I wish, wish, wish, I had skipped wanting the heart rate monitor and gone with a FitBit or Jawbone. Best I can do is try and keep someone else from making the same mistake I did. Just check out the Withings Facebook product support page first before you buy. [...]
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great for people who like puzzles, like me. Some games it feels like the puzzles are getting easier and easier, but Cans Crush Saga it just keeps you attached to the hard levels. Once you start a hard level I normally is determined to finish it. Then, when I do I want to beat another level. This great for kids of all ages, but recommend to people who like puzzles!

B005S9EJ14|5.0|It was a delightful movie........as well as the book.  The only complaint I had was that the dialogue was always so much softer than the extraneous sounds of the setting, so that I was constantly having to adjust the volume.  Great story, though, and wonderful actors.

B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Lyrically probably his best work. It doesn't sound like the first MMLP but it's not intended to. Something for everyone - some slow songs (\\"The Monster\\") some fast songs (\\"Rap God\\"). Some jokey songs (Berzerk, So Far...). The jokey songs work better than the ones on \\"Encore\\". Worth buying.

0345472322|5.0|Dweck has written a book that all parents, teachers, administrators - well, anyone working with anyone in a learning context, and anyone who is a learner (that would be everyone, I do believe!) MUST read!  It's a revolution in thinking about the role of mindset in the process of acquiring knowledge with understanding that can then be assimilated and applied when necessary.  But it's also a book that really supports us in learning about ourselves as learners. Get a copy, read it - out loud, to yourself, to anyone who will listen!  Then talk about it and listen too!

B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is an amazing book. I think it was on one of the amazon kindle daily deals or something, and I was trying to save those that I'd randomly bought for when I go to Spain in August, but i mistook this one for a book I thought i took out of the library and began reading it and couldn't stop. Have you ever seen the movie Memento? If you haven't, go see it, I saw it in the theatre all those years ago, but it's on netflix on demand right now. He has no memory and is trying to uncover his life and mystery. Well our main character here wakes up every single day, not remembering anything from her adult life, or any of the days before. Whatever she learns that day, she forgets when she falls asleep. She begins keeping a journal, and trying to piece together the mystery that is her life. Throughout the book we're trying to decide who to trust - her husband, her therapist, can she even trust herself? What is true and what is not? Your mind is thinking the entire time, until the very end, although by then i'd pretty much figured it out. It's just the whole thing is so interesting coming from the point of view of an unreliable narrator. Every single thing could be wrong. I highly recommend this book. It's thoughtful and engaging at the same time. It could get bogged down with being smart, but it's not. It's a definite page-turner, and I appreciated reading it on my new kindle because i can read so much faster when i don't have to physically turn a page.

0385743564|4.0|ok, if you're looking at this book, theres a good chance you know who brandon sanderson is.  you've probably been reading some hate along the lines of him being formulaic.  i wont deny it.  strong female characters, detailed rules to how powers/magic work, incredibly detailed world building, plot twists on plot twists, people who aren't really who they seem they are and last minute revelations or realizations that save the day.  most of that is in here.  so yeah, sanderson is formulaic, it just happens to be the formula to a story i know i'll enjoy.<br /><br />  i enjoyed this story, but honestly it just wasnt really as good as mistborn or way of kings....warbreaker...i'd even say elantris.  still a good book.  its also the beginning of a series and i am definately looking forward to more.  i also loved steelheart's name and passive powers.  you'll see.<br /><br />  let me put this clearly.  if you like sandersons work, you'll enjoy this.  if you're looking for superhero stories, take into account this is a world with no heroes.  all the good guys are basic human, no powers.  lets be honest, its much more likely that people would be corrupted by their powers than decide to save the world with it.

B001NOD0Q8|5.0|Hugo, and Nebula awards. I don't think more needs to be said.<br /><br />Ok, I'll blather on, but I already told you all you need to know.<br /><br />In the course of this novel it is difficult not to get emotionally invested, and then Mr. Card has you.  Like a wizard, he works the magic that you want from reading science fiction.  What made this novel a certainty for its many awards is that it has it all.  Science fiction, good characters that develop and change, excellent turns and twists that are logical but that may seem unlikely while you first read it.  A building crescendo to a climax that if you haven't been playing very close attention may seem like M. Night Shyamalan probably stole the conclusion idea for his movie “Sixth Sense”.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card is creative, intuitive, entertaining, and thought provoking.  Thought provoking... so many things in this novel could sit you down and cause you to ponder the ideas. Not that you will slow down reading... it is not a novel that you easily set down for any reason.  I love a fantastic writer like Issac Asimov (the greatest ever) and Orson Scott Card, (who would be embarrassed to be referenced in the likes of Asimov.)<br /><br />Something I noticed towards the end of the novel is that back when he wrote this book, Orson Scott Card appears to be intimately aware of worldly affairs of today's current affairs (2013) that we are only today starting to fully grasp.  Don't know how that fits into a review... maybe that this book, even in it's little side narratives, really is thought provoking.<br /><br />I understand the movie came out last week.  I promise you 10,000% or more, that as great the movie might be, it cannot be as good as this novel. I had read the novel “before”, and I wanted to refresh myself before I saw the movie (long overdue, but only recently technologically possible). I loved Ender Wiggin.  I loved him then.  I love him now, decades after I first met him.<br /><br />I don't easily amp out on my rating stars with the belief that things could always be better.  Hugo and Nebula... how much better could it be?<br /><br />A little “Card candy” for Orson's greater fans, the unabridged audio version of this novel has a rather lengthy interview or monologue by Mr. Card at the end where you can learn a great deal about this story and his next book in the series.  I was fascinated with the story of how this fantastic novel came to be.  The road it took has as many twists and turns as the book itself has.  You can also learn a bit about the new movie even though it had not gone into production before the audio book was published.  That was also amusing and insightful.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Loved it! A fun read with many twists and turns just as the television program, but with many unique differences...the book describes Theon, Reek, and Ramsay very differently than the show I found.  I love reading the Arya chapters best of all...what a brave, spirited, unyielding force she is becoming! Some fun surprises to read as well were the Jon Snow chapters compared to the TV show...I liked the book version more than the show I think in some ways, wish we could have met the characters Ebben and Stonesword in the show!
159420411X|5.0|Nate is smart but not full of himself, and the \\"anecdotes\\" he provides to support his thinking are actually quite diverse in approach and provide a very simple, yet profound explanation to the issue.<br /><br />There are funny bits as well.<br /><br />If you are in your 3-5th year of working with data and statistics (and maybe you are a rogue like me, who never thought he'd be working with data this closely), this book is a must-read. Although, as the book rightfully implies, some of the great scientific minds could find it's no-nonsense approach equally valuable.

Amazingly well-developed characters that come to life with incredible voice acting. And no heavy-handed morality tale. And Ursula is probably one of a handful of villains I actively like because she's so deliciously evil.<br /><br />I watched the VHS so much as a child I had the entire film's dialogue as well as songs memorised. Now I've bought the DVD to have and share this treasure again.

0812982622|4.0|An excellent read overall. The author is very clever, hinting at large overarching themes throughout the book that ultimately give the book its meaning. For those who love getting attached to a character, this may not be for you. As others have said, you will not find yourself linked hand in hand with the main character but more just a feeling of neutrality to him. Also not for those who aren't willing to push through about 75 pages that go rather slow. For most it is a great read.

B0081SRJSY|5.0|Carcassonne is a German tile game playable by any number of people (within reason).  Basically - you build terrain and cities using tiles that have a variety of fields, city segments, and road segments.  Scoring is done during the game and then at the end (when all the tiles are played).  I've seen many games won and lost during the end scoring.  Every game is different, alliances are made and destroyed, and interesting strategies evolve - I've taken control of a 20 piece city by playing two tiles.

B008JFUNJQ|3.0|.<br />[FOR THOSE WHO WANT A SIMPLIFIED REVIEW, JUST ZIP TO THE FINAL FOUR PARAGRAPHS. THERE ARE NO SPOILERS.]<br /><br />Just about anybody who has read Ender's Game knows what to expect when it comes to this movie, and it is my guess that these are the people who comprise the majority of the audience. In other words, the screenwriter (and director) Gavin Hood's decision to let us in early on a key element of the surprise ending is probably a wise one; it is now only Ender himself, and his youthful comrades, who remain in the dark. Though a good deal of the book's shocking ending depended on this factor, the film, pointedly, does not. (NOTE: Even author Orson Scott Card himself--who tried to write several unsuccessful screenplays for this movie himself--conceded its seeming impossibility in this regard).<br /><br />Now, as to whether ENDER'S GAME does service to the novel, that's a question I suppose only the box office will ultimately reveal. For me, I found the movie to be a lavish but watered down adaptation. True, making movies out of books is usually a process prone to reduction, but I felt the movie lacked so much that it affected my appreciation of it as the character-driven story that the novel depicted so well.  And Ender's development as a character is key to the success of the movie.<br /><br />Not to reveal anything--which I won't--but ENDER'S GAME the novel is a story told through several narratives, much like another great young adult novel called [[ASIN:B004Q9NYC2 I AM THE CHEESE]], by Robert Cormier. The narrative threads help us understand the fabric of characterization and plot that one single narration could not have achieved. ENDER'S GAME the novel was spectacularly successful at this--so much so that the novel has sold millions of copies, has been translated into over 30 languages, has won the Hugo and the Nebula, and on and on. (It's unfortunate that it has been tarred by the furor caused by author Orson Scott Card's negative views on homosexuality, particularly dealing with same-sex marriage, but that--and WORSE offenses--he engineered himself.)<br /><br />But it is ENDER'S GAME the movie that is the subject here, and whether IT works or not. While it has all the trimmings of high-caliber acting, extraordinary special effects, and certainly a compelling plot, it came up short at affecting the grand story told by the novel. Where the novel succeeded--and so well, in fact, that it is suggested reading in U.S. Marine Corps training school--is in the details of Ender's training, and in particular in his ingenious response to the dilemmas dealt him by his battle school commanders.<br /><br />And as anyone familiar with the book will tell you, it's in this regard that [[ASIN:0812550706 ENDER'S GAME]] the novel is so compelling. Ender's ability to think his way out of difficult situations makes for fascinating reading, and Card deserves credit for the brilliant strategies he invoked. The complex conflicts he faced were not just military ones--for instance, he was not only repeatedly bullied by his jealous fellow students, but he also used his growing success as a tool to force concessions from his trainers--they were understandable and progressive, and the novel reported his steady coming to terms with his hostile environs in a step-by-step manner.<br /><br />You see, the world is facing its second set of attacks by a culture it barely defeated the first time around, and there's no denying that this time it is likely to face overwhelming destruction. Ender is one of the latest round of cadets being rushed through training school in a desperate attempt to find someone, ANYONE who can think like their enemy, and use that empathy to defeat them. The older tacticians have been too set in their ways to accomplish such a task--the secret, they know, lies in the young, and Ender is the best of the lot. In fact, he's the best anyone has EVER seen.<br /><br />Yet in the movie this prowess is displayed so briefly that it's no more than a highlight reel...it's like watching a three-hour football game in a hour. I really felt the movie's brevity in the scenes concerning the computer program designed to bring out his inner demons, and again in the revealing progression of games played within the weightless Battle Dome. It was there his genius really revealed itself, and his spectacular outside-the-box strategies came across so well.<br /><br />While the acting was of a high caliber--particularly that of Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley as a major interested in Ender's psychology and a singular hero of the last war, respectively--and the special effects were grand, I felt let down by the short shrift the movie gave Ender's tactical growth.  Again, this is no small factor--it is, in fact, what makes the book so magnificent. And it just wasn't really there for me.<br /><br />So, while I feel that the movie made good entertainment, I do not believe it was a compelling movie for the same reasons as its source material. As such, I only give it a three...maybe higher if you have not read the book and are only there to see razzle and dazzle. In that case, you're on your own.t's no more than a highlight reel...it's like watching a three-hour football game in a hour.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|my 17 year old daughter loves this game also.  every time I get on my kindle to play,  I'm on a different level
B00C74SHRK|1.0|something really wrong. I just do not &#34;buy&#34; the  setting of the story... I can not &#34;believe&#34; it ... and it gets worse as the story enfolds. Have stopped reading. I normally do not go with hypes, did with this one, and regret it ...
B0002W10U0|5.0|Fire in the sky is a 5 star rating in my eyes because its facinating in every way possible. Thank you amazon.com. John S.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|The boy really played a awesome part in the movie. It was a slow movie to begin with for me, but picked up and had a good finish
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved the book even if I had to read it  and do a book report, because I was grounded I really enjoyed it.I also had never heard of Nikola Tesla if it had not been for my mom.I also liked all of his inventions.

B008J05EL8|1.0|It says it download but when I click on it nothing happens. Looks like I wasted my money. Amazon should look into this app before allowing more people to be ripped off
B00CH26TL8|5.0|A very fun and exciting game to play although I tend to get mad at myself for missing my aim I find myself going back in a few minutes and trying again.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Not only is the story engaging and well written, but it also addresses complex and meaningful themes about truth, religion, faith and experience. Enjoyable and powerful reading.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Best Iron Man movie yet! They just keep getting better - GO TONY!  With this kinda consistent excellence can't wait for more!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|The first thing that made me so very happy(borrowed that line from BS&T) was that it was delivered two days early. I plugged the unit into the requisite power/charging port in my vehicle. It had two usb ports, one marked Apple and the other Android. Since I had a Galaxy Note 3, I plugged it into the Apple side since that is usually for the 2amp charging. Worked flawlessly. I luv Anker. I luv Amazon. I luv when what is expected is always the reality. Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am completely obsessed with this game. But it runs a little slow. I'm not sure if it's my Kindle Fire, or the download. But over all it is a great game.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very well written. The book catches your fancy with all the legal stuff thrown in. As the book progresses it gets worse and worse for the protagonist and you are looking forward to the legal legerdemain which will make it worthwhile. Without giving away any spoilers have to say the end was an anti-climax.
1476727651|3.0|I've read about 40 of King's books, and I should disclose that I'm not one of those people who say, \\"King was great in his early days, but he's no good anymore.\\" I think he can still write great fiction. For example, of his more recent work, I loved 11/22/63. And I really liked Duma Key. However,I thought Under the Dome was a bloated mess. Joyland was good, but not great.<br /><br />So what about Doctor Sleep?<br /><br />It was okay, but I'd rank it near the bottom of King's work. I would never want to read it again. I just couldn't find interest in the characters. I didn't really care about them, and when that doesn't happen in a story, there's really not much interest generated (at least for me). There's no need to go into plot analysis, as many other reviewers have addressed it. But the bottom line is that this book is not very satisfying, even for a King fan.<br /><br />Get it from your library, if you must, but don't waste your money adding it to your collection.
B00136LZG8|5.0|Classic Carlos and the boys. I have been a Santana maven from way back. The music is pure Santana: from the nice bass tracks to the numerous acoustic rhythms. I mix of rock, mild jazz and Latin rhythms hooked me from the start. I possessed this compilation some time ago and lost it. When I saw it at this price, I knew that i had to possess it again. Never looked back. Excellent purchase.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|My wife and I love this game. It's highly addictive. One of the best hidden object games in a while and its 100% free!!
B00E6890VC|5.0|I bought this album mainly because &#34;The Mother We Share&#34; is one of my favorite songs of the year and listening to it on vinyl made me realize that every song on here is fantastic. I sometimes skip &#34;Under the Tide&#34; though, but that's only because I just love Lauren Mayberry's voice so much.
1401917232|5.0|I'm so glad I read this book.  It was like a kickstart to my spiritual program.  My reaction to it was similar to what I felt when I finished Gary's book The Disappearance of the Universe.  My spirit was activated and wanted more.  I feel rejuvenated and ready for a more consistent spiritual practice.  Thank you, Gary!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is challenging. It is also fun. I enjoy the suspense and the fast acting hand eye coordination. I suck at it but it's still fun.
B001AR0D4A|4.0|I usually do not like Stephen king movies but this is a Great movie except for the ending which is disappointing!  I don't think people would react in that manor!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Hard to use, still trying to learn it. But  never the less l still liked it. I'll see try and try.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Hooked on this! There are ads but you DON'T have to watch them! Love this app... on my phone and my Kindle Fire!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing this!  Its always different and very challenging!  Not only a kids game! Makes you really do so real thinking!
B001AP11L6|5.0|I'm old. I can count the number of new artists to come down the pike in the last twenty years that I've liked on one hand and still have the thumb left over.  Jack White is one of them, seamlessly attacking all the things I love about music: blues, old country, rock and punk -- and putting a twist on it that is still a unique and compelling style all his own. &#34;Ball and Biscuit&#34; gives me new hope for the future of music.  My only complaint is that it took so long to get to this party... why did none of my friends tell me about this?!?  Oh, well... I'm here now and enjoying every minute of it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with Android for watching movies  and YouTube on the TV. Excellent with Google play Music in the cloud.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book I couldn't stop reading it. I finished the book in 2 days (would have been 1 day if it wasn't for pesky sleep and work). I had always wanted to read the book and now that I finally read it I wish I would have read it sooner. Best book I've read in a while. Don't really want to say to much I don't want to give spoilers besides plenty info on this book here already.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I was so far in the game then somehow it all got deleted :/ Hopefully it wont do it again
1609611543|5.0|Wheat is toxic to me and many others, this book explains why. Everyone should read it for the insight into genetic modification and what it can lead to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|in my opinion I really enjoy this awesome game. there's and new character that is unlimited time his name I bolt you have to by it with real money
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Awesome best app ever played by me no app can be any better got a steal to purchase for free
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|It's a better app than most I've seen on the Amazon app store, but still have to admit there's too many ads for my liking. Also a darker background would look much nicer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My brother is only three years old and he is building libraries Mansions shacks stores hotels and more . Thanks to this game he is always wanting to go outside and build little houses out of sticks for our cat. This game kept him active and creative.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I really loved this book.....Especially in light of these long term kidnapping cases coming into the media.  Really written well from the view point of the child....I could not stop reading until it was done!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I liked how the book explained who the gods were. For example when Ares was introduced it said that he was the God of War. Also using personality traits also helped me picture what they are like. The book also uses very good descriptions that helps me picture what is happening such as Percy saying, I could see flames beneath his glasses. Prior to reading this book i knew nothing regarding greek mythology and I actually understand and learned about it from this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Lots of functionality. User interface is overly complex, not pretty. But it doesn't really bother me. It works great. I like the fact that it can wake up to a song
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie and this game. I love when my nephew plays he make s me laugh every time the Minion runs into something. It's a great game for adults as well as children.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Every once in awhile I like to listen to different types of sounds such as thunder or the ocean but finding decent quality effects can be tricky. This programme has some of the best samples I've heard.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app!  It is very easy to use and I have had no problems. I would recommend this app to others.
1932735410|5.0|I highly suggest this book for your study needs.  I passed the exam and became PMP certified on my first try!  This study guide is very thorough and explains the concepts well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked on this game!  I could play it all day but I have to work and do homework.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|This movie truly lives up to it's title. Ethan is excellent in showing his fear and as the viewer your right there with him.<br />Only one thing I'd change is that too much of the movie is in the dark, literally. First I thought it was my DVD portable player. Then I watched it on my new 32inch Sony flat screen with a Sony DVD player attached and too many scenes<br />were too dark, and not all of them were meant to be at night.<br />To sum up, the scary in this is that the monster can't be caught or even believed by most, which makes it's scariness<br />all that much and more. I mean it could be believed if you're superstitious. I could believe it. We need many more horrors of this degree.  Absolute BRAVO.
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|In his younger days Steven King produced some great books.  Somewhere along the way, possibly right after he got hit by a van, he lost his fire or just got full of himself.  I've skipped a lot of his books over the past few years.  Each time I bought one to see if things had improved, sadly they had not.  A friend loaned me Under The Dome which had about 450 pages of story but contained over 1000.  He is entitled to his political opinions but he spent a great deal of UTD bashing conservatives and GWB in particular.  If I wanted to read a political opinion I'd have bought one.  This books starts out pretty well, and contains a lot of conservative bashing which seems to be his new purpose.  Nevertheless I was taken with Doctor Sleep for almost half the book.  It started to go downhill at that point.  I did with great effort finish it and have resolved to never read anything else by Mr. King again.
0812982622|5.0|Very hard to read, but I was unable to put it down. If half of it reflects reality,life in North Korea is unimaginable. The level of cruelty, and rationalization for it is incomprehensible. This book is so well written that it piqued my interest to read more about North Korea.<br />This is one of those books that is hard to recommend to everyone because of all the suffering, but it was well worth the read for me.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I think that it is a little boring after a while.  It cute and it looks pretty. I would like  it better if there was more for the pets to do. I am glad it is a free game  because I can take  it or leave it.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Alan Jackson is so talented.  He has written and played some great songs, especially &#34;Where Were You&#34; after 9-11. This is a different genre and it is a great recording of his incredible talent!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I think this is a great camera. One thing I don't like about it, is that you have to write a review to get a color lockscreen. But it is hd which is great.
B000FC13UE|4.0|Not my favorite of his books but that's like saying something is a 'minor' Picasso. Gaiman's stories always take readers on a merry chase.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|This story is passingly well constructed but the book still remains the benchmark by which this story can be properly told.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Couldn't wait for this CD to be released.  And it is all I expected and more.  Celine keeps getting better and better.  A wonderful entertainer with a terrific gift of her voice.  She is also personal inspiration.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I'm grateful this book exist, and that it came out while I am still in my 20's so that I could heed her advice early. It's really nice to hear someone say out loud (or, in writing) the things we've felt but couldn't put into words, and to hear someone who has been through it give practical advice on HOW to navigate the challenges of work and family. Sandberg may be wealthier than most women and have more resources at her disposal, but she is well aware of that fact and gives advice and examples that are meaningful for a much wider demographic than her own. I would love to be able to thank Sheryl Sandberg for being brave enough to write this book.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|It came in on expected date! The box was in great condition and was still sealed! Awesome Comedy! I finished the first season in two days!
B0020TS5LK|5.0|Here is where Hollywood first learned that a comic book movie could be made.  The people who read them as kids have matured a lot (some of us) and need the media to evolve with our changing tastes mature themes and all.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|Get these every year for my granddaughters (2). They have a collection of over 20 each displayed (in the boxes) on a shelf in their bedroom.  And they are now 21 and 23 and still want them.  More beautiful each year.  Couldn't pick a favorite if we tried.  Amazon price is very reasonable.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game got me into the story right away. I adore the monkey! I've played many games like this and this one is first class. I played it on a Kindle FireHD and the graphics are really superb and it translates well on the small screen.

B007URVZJ6|3.0|This book is super basic. For not knowing anything about self publishing, I could walk away knowing I can do this.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great book! Still some unanswered questions, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way. Will just have to read the next book.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This movie is great!  It is a true classic.  A must have for a true cinematic fan.  A++++  Great Movie!
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie! Used to watch it as a child so I was thrilled to see it on here on sale for such a good price! It arrived intact and well protected. Would recommend this for older children , like pg13, and up. Very cute movie.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Because it does not work,hence all these days did not write the review<br />I do not like to complaint too much
B008JFUPPI|5.0|We loved this movie! IT made us laugh so hard! Great family night out! We would recommend this movie to a great family night.
B000HKYBXA|3.0|I like to read classic literature and then find movie adaptations.  This is promoted because of it's fidelity to the text.  I don't really want to criticize anything, but I think maybe I'm not charmed by Kenneth Branagh for whatever reason.  Still, I wouldn't try to dissuade anyone from giving it a try.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|its a vary fun game and the king pig gets fat and brps. its to funny. you will love this game!

B007SGM084|5.0|Best. Book. Ever. I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone, each chapter is beautifully written and so addicting. Laters
B00006FDCJ|5.0|really good Clint Eastwood western.  Good bookend for his early spaghetti westerns where there wasn't really any moral question posed regarding the life of a bounty hunter.
B002GMSMHS|5.0|Fast delivery and reasonable price. Didn't hold as many pix as my last 2 GB card...only about half. Not sure why as settings did not change on the camera.
014241039X|5.0|Roald Dahl uses fun descriptive language.  I use this as a read aloud when I substitute teach.  The characters are outrageous, which appeals to kids.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing product and very simple to setup. Although I can only use YouTube and hope that Google gets more services to work in other countries as well.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Could be more simple to operate and work better with included software. Not at all what I expected. Very disappointed in this product. There is no online information or larger instructions for operating the device. Amazon should not sell this product at all.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Much more room inside than expected. Great and solid design. Easily able to move compartments inside. Fits more than you would expect yet not a big and bulky bag. Going to buy another for my friend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was a fun game it was a little challenge but it was not to hard.  waiting for more levels!
B00FQ272ZI|4.0|\\"All Is Lost\\" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of \\"Our Man\\" (as Robert Redford is named in the credits) alone at sea. As the movie opens, we are told Our Man is 1,700 miles away from the Sumatra Straits in the Indian Ocean, and in a voice over, Redford tells us that \\"all is lost, except for the body and soul, or whatever remains of that. I'm sorry\\". The screen goes dark and then states \\"8 days earlier\\". We see Our Man waking up in his sailboat, only to find that there is gashing hole due to a collision with a container which appears to have fallen off a containership in mid ocean. And from there, Our Man's troubles start. Will Our Man make it out alive? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: this movie is a tour-de-force in every which way, the likes of which we don't get to see very much. A lot has been made about the fact that there is no dialogue in the movie, but frankly I find it a refreshing take. How many people would dare make a movie without any dialogue? Gutsy call. Second, this movie is written and directed by J. C. Chandor, who made an intriguing debut a couple of years ago with \\"Margin Call\\". Now this. Can't wait to see what he'll do next. Third, there is the bravura performance from Robert Redford, now 77 if you can believe it (but looking at least 10-15 years younger that that). In a very different way, this is reminiscent of Tom Hanks in \\"Castaway\\", except in this movie there is not \\"pre\\" and \\"after\\", it's just Redford as Our Man battling the elements at sea. We don't know anything about Our Man's background, his life situation, etc. But we nevertheless are emotionally invested in this character. Last but certainly not least, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I was really surprised how tense this movie experience is (and I mean that as a compliment). At one point, Our Man's radio equipment falters and then comes back to life. Our Man scrambles to get it working and says \\"This is the Virginia Jean with an SOS call, over\\" three or four times, until the radio just dies again, this time for good. You can just see the despair in Our Man's eyes. (Surely Redford will get serious Best Actor Oscar consideration for his role in this movie?) Kudos as well for the beautiful soundtrack by Alex Ebert, I will have to check that out.<br /><br />I had seen the trailer for this a couple of times in recent weeks and couldn't wait to see this. It finally opened today in Cincinnati and I went to see it right away. The late matinee screening I saw this at was well attended, which is great news, as this movie deserves to be seen. I couldn't believe when the lights came back on, as this movie had absolutely flown by in no time. If you are in the mood for a tense adventure movie that brings a fresh take and is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. \\"All Is Lost\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!en comes back to life.

B003XRELGQ|3.0|What can I say about Vonnegut that hasn't already been said?  Nothing, I'm sure.  Everybody has opinions about him that are as strong as his own opinions about the world and writing.  I find it strange to talk about the author in a book review but it can't be helped.  Vonnegut the writer seems to overshadow the book.  I guess some personalities come across that way.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect when I picked up &#34;Cat's Cradle&#34;.  The book had an air of mystery to it and I only read it because I wanted to read more Vonnegut.  Sometimes you just need to.<br /><br />&#34;Cat's Cradle&#34; feels like a series of interconnected, bite-sized, vignettes.  The writing is slim and direct yet still manages to enthrall.  It made for a quick read.  Almost too quick because I find reflecting on the book difficult.  It feels like Vonnegut walked by and slapped me, leaving a stinging red palm print on my cheek.<br /><br />Not that it is a bad thing.  Sometimes a brisk slap is good.  The sparse writing hits hard.  The story hits hard.  But the characters feel as thin as the writing.  None of them engage my sensibilities to care for them.  This is the one flaw in an otherwise interesting book that tackles one of the grandest narratives: the end of the world.<br /><br />But then, maybe that is part of it.  What is a person compared to the world?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been searching for months on kindle thanks for finally giving us candy crush next time don't wait so long.
B009YBU8CQ|4.0|Poignant and compelling. A sad chapter in African history sensitively told. Could we have done better? Who is responsible for the issues presented. Thought provoking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and easy to get hooked. I don't like waiting for more lives though and won't spend money to get them. Could be good though, can help limit length of play time. Good for whole family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very addictive fun game.  I'm having so much fun playing the games my friends have been talking about.  And I appreciate the opportunity for updates!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It has great levels.  And you can re-play levels trying different strategies.  And it's just non-stop fun!  Recommended for young kids too.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Great read! Sensitively written from the viewpoint of someone who accepts they are not normal. Sometimes confronting. Gentle humour sets the perspective.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great tool for watching movies on my TV. Easy to setup and use with a great quality! I am using Chromecast outside the US (live in Austria) and it works really fine.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is not a book that immediately grabs you, but is one that slowly creeps into your heart as the lives that surround Liesel Meminger are revealed. It also offers a view of the German world from the human point of view. Thank you!
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|The Toy Store's site for Mapfactor gave it good reviews, but I got nowhere from the start when I downloaded the maps.  It may have been that my Toshiba tablet is not compatible with the app.  For instance I could not enter my Country, City or location because when I entered the Country I could not skip down to enter the state, address or anything else because the first entries would disappear and there was no way to backtrack.  Though I downloaded the free maps, I could not view them.  A second download didn't help.  When trying to Sign Up at the free map site, I had to trick the tablet to get it to show the search icon, and then the keyboard kept hiding the \\"@\\" sign making it impossible complete entering my email address.  I finally had to uninstall.  Had great hopes for it, sigh, didn't come about.<br />More step by step instructions may help as it isn't all that intuitive.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great book. Grand daughter should me how this worked with the purple pen.  we both had fun and enjoyed the story
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I adore the primary characters, the story lines are always cohesive, and the genre (paranormal, drama, comedy) makes this one of my favorites.  When you are sick to death of &#34;reality&#34; shows this is the perfect medicine!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very much enjoyed this last book in the trilogy ...excellent conclusion to the story ....a riveting page turner with many twists and turns..
0887431453|4.0|a Good book. My grand daughter enjoyed it and still enjoys it.  A good buy for the fun of it
006202406X|4.0|I think a book is good when you have a strong emotion at the end of reading the book. This story REALLY gave me strong emotions at the end. It made me angry, upset, sad at the end. I know most people would get upset because they hated the sad ending, but come on, it was realistic. This is what happens every day in society. The bad guys are alive and the good guys usually die. Anyway I liked it. Questions were answered through the book. Everyone learned how to make peace in society and in themselves. I hope no one is rating this book with one star, purely on the basis of the ending. The only down side of this story is the writing. Veronica Roth did a poorly job on writing two different perspectives (Tobias and Tris). You couldn't distinguish whose perspective you were reading because they sounded the same.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun and so addicting!! You can seriously play this games for hours, until you run out of lives...

B00AEFXE3Q|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. As a prime member it was on my door in no time. This is also a great date night movie.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was cool but really long and took me 2 months it was horribly long (snap) just like that yep
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Worth the money!  Excellent Middle school read...yes, I love those too. I've read his work before and will continue to do so.
B000001G5H|5.0|Pollini is an artist in a class by himself.  His clarity and sensitivity are unparallelled.  This CD replaced an LP by another artist, and the difference was audible.  There's  so much expression in his interpretation.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is just so cool and is better than the first one. Hope you like my short simple exact on review.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|It is a good show. We just discovered the series. I like all the characters they are great each have a different twist
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It was funny and entertaining. My family loved it. Would recommend to a friend for them to watch, especially ele.age.

I put in an old cassette tape and hit play on the boom box and record in Audition and started digitizing my music cassette collection.  I'm recording in stereo, 44,100 hz, 256 kps, 32 bit mixing.<br /><br />Considering the tapes are old and haven't been played in years the mp3 quality is very good.  It was easy to import them into the iTunes library.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book is so fantastic... I couldn't quite peel my eyes from it. This is cheesy, but I cried for Emma when she stormed off after arguing with Jack, and also when Jack walked off without speaking, near the end. (Oops, spoiler alert!) Dear Lord, this book is just... amazing. I love it. I honestly wish I could've rated more than five stars. Anyone who loves a romance with sparks of comedy and moment  of tears... Can You Keep a Secret? is THE book!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game has excellent graphics and a good storyline. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging. But you can use hints as needed. The only downsize is the adventure could be later.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|&#34;Holding On To You,&#34; was the first song that caught my attention. After checking out samples of some of their other songs I was hooked and the full cd did not disappoint!
B001AITH50|1.0|All I could see in this movie was a vacuous celebration of over-the-top gore and killing.  The Brad Pitt character is so depressed after the loss of his wife that he allows himself to be turned into a vampire, so that he can have all of eternity to continue to feel sorry for himself (while also occasionally killing innocent people and then feeling bad about it).  This is in contrast to the Tom Cruise character who revels in the delight of killing (and always with some sort of twisted sexual allusion).  Of course there is more to it than this, but in essence it's just more of the same: lots of blood and lots of sick sexual innuendo associated with the murder of lots of people, the majority of whom are suggested to be of loose morals.  The light in all this darkness is supposed to be the Brad Pitt character, but I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for his deep angst at his condition given that he was so blinded by self-absorption that he doesn't even think about how he might be able to try to use his extraordinary powers for greater good.  Although it came highly recommended and with a star-studded cast, the whole thing just left me feeling physically ill and wishing that I had done anything else with my two hours and $3 than subject myself to this abomination.  My husband actually stopped watching halfway through and I wish I had followed suit rather than sticking it out and waiting for it to get better (which it never did).  I have not read the books (obviously) so my comments are just based on the movie.
030746363X|5.0|I lost 30 pounds on this diet plan. It's an easy to follow instruction book to improve your body and other areas of your life. I used to check this book out at the library and found that I needed it more than just a couple weeks at a time.
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|I really want to love this album. I'm struggling to understand why a song like \\"Stronger Than I Was\\", which should be an outtake at best, is on the actual album while a song like \\"Wicked Ways\\" is on the bonus disk. A 41 year old man should really grow up, move on and find bigger and better things to rap about than these throwback nonsense lyrics, which have been overdone by him. He is better than this. While a few songs are impressive, most of them are just sad for an artist whose biggest comment on YouTube seems to be \\"the best rapper alive\\". That's a big fish to fry. You'd better get to work, Eminem. That being said, there's no denying the consistent skill and no one is better at fun wordplay but it's hardly enough to save this album. Still, it's worth the listen and the money (if you don't pay full price ;) to decide for yourself.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Fun little movie. The kids enjoy it and enjoyable for the parents.  I would recommend it to any who likes Disney type movies
B003K07DUC|3.0|I had read the book, and this adventure-themed adaptation of it is a lot better than I would have expected from the material they had to work with.  The Matt Damon character is great.  Not quite as much fun to watch as the Bourne movies, though, because you sort of know how the story will go.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Handy little device.  Works great plugged into our surround sound receiver.  Awesome if you use Google Play music/movies/youtube on an Android device or the Chrome browser. It's a super cheap way to stream things to your TV and definitely worth the price.<br /><br />Cons: Needs external power source/doesn't fit well in a media cabinet (it sticks out pretty far from our receiver and hits the back wall of the cabinet).  If the device is far from your wireless router it can deliver crappy video quality.
0060557818|5.0|I love the concept behind this novel. Gaiman has an incredible talent to bring out magical events and stories from every day simple life and activities. The book is classic &#34;every day joe gets mixed up in something bigger than himself&#34; but it ends up being so much more than that.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|Having passed up the chance to attend this concert as a teenager, I'm so thankful to be able to enjoy it on DVD. I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Fab Faux's tribute to George Harrison at The Beacon in NYC, where they did some of his songs from this. If you like George Harrison, you'll love this DVD. And if you like The Beatles, definitely see The Fab Faux!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Another great book. Gladwell deals with timely topics and turns common wisdom upside down with stories, facts and data that drive home a fresh perspective.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a great read. John grisham at his best. Interesting characters and plot. I imagined Matthew mcconehey as Jake Brigance in a time to kill telling the story. And Ashley Judd as Carla.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Well, not me -- but the cousin I bought it for, and his family, love it.<br />It works well, it is not perfect, but far better then other solutions.
B00486070K|5.0|I needed an ethernet dongle for my Macbook Air and this works great. I have had no problems with it. Although you do pay a little more with this one versus other generic ones, I believe you get what you pay for. It is reliable and is quality made.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|If you enjoy finding hidden objects or the differences between two pictures this is the puzzle game for you. The narrative story is enjoyable as you move through the chapters.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Few movies pull me in like this one did.<br />I really didn't think this was going to be that good a watch until I realized I<br />could not take my eyes away from the monitor.<br />As the movie progressed, it started to remind me of \\"Dark City\\", and as so, I have<br />ordered a copy.<br />The price of admission is minimal, so you should give it a go, it is a great watch.
193700788X|1.0|Mrs. Harris might as well have not written this book. It was so uneventful, boring, it plain sucked. Huge disappointment.<br />Nothing happened. Waste of time & money all around. Struggled to get through it.  Last few books sucked in this series.<br />No pizazz in the characters.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like that it's kind of like xbox,  but I want something like PC. only because it crashes my computer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Have been waiting a long time for this to be available.<br />Very glad. A little weird having such a big playing field.  used to playing on my phone.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|These characters are so timely and the period piece and their enduring accents and the way they present themselves is why I so love a BBC series - British Rules!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Recently updated to include unnecessary and annoying ads, some of which are full-blown commercials. Sad, cuz it used to be fun.  I'm deleting this.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Love this album! It's not like her other albums though. To be honest when I first listened to it I was like &#34;WTF is this!?!?&#34;  The more I listened to it though, the more I fell in love. Such powerful lyrics and her voice is so raw a passionate in this album. Simply magnificent.  &#34;Now when you look at me..you're condemned to see the monster your mother made you to be..and there you got me..that's how you got free...you got rid of me&#34;
B00DPUB56U|3.0|I agree with other reviewers that this is well-acted and has unique aspects. But the unique aspects are what made me dislike this film.<br /><br />The vampires don't have fangs. They have one thumbnail that they can extend into a razor sharp talon for thrusting into the neck or wrist of a victim. Furthermore one is 'made' a vampire by visiting a cave.<br /><br />I thought these plot elements stupid, especially the vampire-making bat cave.<br /><br />Gemma Arterton is Clara the mother Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan). Both are vampires. There's some flashbacks into how both became vampires.<br /><br />They move from place to place living fairly rough. Clara works strip clubs to earn money. It's never explained why because they don't look like they live any place decent.<br /><br />Clara protects her daughter from 'the life' (of a prostitute). Eleanor is forever sixteen. But she's no innocent. She goes to old people when it is their 'time' to die. Then she falls in love and is tired of being a vampire. All worn out plot elements. Ultimately this film's slow pace is boring. It's not even sexy.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I learned to play marking when I was still working. I was glad to find it was available for the KINDLE.
B00F8LPH90|1.0|After purchasing and downloading this app I continue to have a error message pop up stating &quot;You don't own this app and content will not load&quot;.  Not pleased with this as I have been an avid supporter of Amazon and the Kindle Fire.
B00DQZQPNM|3.0|Because the tiny nubbies on the side and the wimpy elastic band do not hold the kindle in position.<br />I had to put velcro on it to keep it .  Also, any time the cover is loose, that is not closed or held by the velcro,<br />it flops around.  Good thing I got the accident coverage.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Very interesting book after watching the BBC show. Very helpful, but has too many recipies that take up space.  More personal information and stories, less cookbook but still very much recommened,
B00CEF014E|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this fast paced, exciting book which delves into the deeply disturbing underworld of human sacrifice. It's packed with non stop drama from the very beginning with plenty of twists and turns. Dana's character was brave, unstoppable and determined to the very end to get to the truth. I simply could not put it down.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Love this game. It isn't going like some of the games. It keeps my interest and it is challenging. Can't stop paying it.
1449305172|5.0|Fantastic book by Ash. A must read for all founders and even existing businesses who are doing new product development.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The book was good, but what I don't understand is why was there a holographic will in the first place. All Mr. Hubbard had to do was call Jake, or go back to the lawyers that drew up his first will, or legal zoom whatever and draw up a new will.  Then none of this mess would have had to take place, and the book would have been like a couple of  pages.
B003VANOFY|1.0|This headset had me really happy until I found out that you can only input audio at 16000Hz (what windows calls &#34;Tape Recorder Quality&#34;).  Every other Logitech headset I've ever had goes up to 48000.  Logitech support is useless, their forums contains pages of unanswered and undressed complaints, and there is no clear answer.  Additionally, the sidetone volume level is not exposed to Windows so you must use the Logitech proprietary software to control sidetone, which is only loud enough when the 7.1 surround is turned off, which is a major problem considering you can't hear ANYTHING around you once you put these on, including your own voice -- which is great .. if there was adequate sidetone support so you can hear yourself think.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This has to be the best Multiplayer Fps game I ever played on the Kindle Fire,Most of the apps and games Amazon has are just scams and ripoff, but this is the real deal.Unlike in minecraft and such, the connection is a lot more stable and no online glitches or anything.Did I mention Great Graphics and Gameplay?You can choose from a lot of weapons,and games to play online.The only problem I don't like about the game is you need a connection for play it,I rather it you can play the training levels offline.I am hoping you can make it possible to talk to people,and chat.Overall this is a MUST HAVE!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|You will love this game.You unlock new cars and places to drive.You can also upgrade your car's.Trust me,you will love this game!!!!!!!
B006OMM8RG|5.0|Nice looking mini figs. Any other Captain America mini figs released will most likely be different to this version, also the Chitauri  mini figs won't likely be re-used either.
B00B5C0YOO|1.0|This app is virtually useless. It essentially just redirects you to functions the android UI already offers. Good thing it was free, otherwise I'd be demanding a refund!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game rules.I love playing games like this. I could name 5 reasons why you should play it.<br />1.you have fun...........
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game with realistic horses and horsey chores.  I hardly ever make in game purchases, so I'm glad that this game is fun whether you buy extras gems or not!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. I am hooked. Just wish I didn't have to pay for the extras. wish you could earn them by beating boards.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have spent two nights devouring this book just like I did with the first one. They are great! I can hardly wait to start the third and final book!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is fun and I love the varity of different animals and creatures I can get. I highly recommend this game for animal lovers
6305388458|5.0|Classic and collectible Python. Still hilarious. My son always wants to watch it and Holy Grail as a family movie... lol.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved it!!!!  Edge of your seat action! Quick one liners!  Recommend for family movie night!  Enjoyed every minute of it!
