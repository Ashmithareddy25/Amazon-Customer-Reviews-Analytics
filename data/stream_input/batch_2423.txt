B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loooooove this app. I'm in third grade and in challenge. My challenge teacher lets us play on IPads. She has subway surfer. I play it all the time!!
B009MXSWI8|5.0|The stream worked well and the resolution was acceptable.  I love this movie, but I'll leave a review of the actual film to others.
B004P1JEXE|2.0|I know this book is meant as 'half' of the full story & only focuses on certain characters but its very poor.nothing happens in this book & its a tough read the majority of the time.after the 3rd book been the best in the series so far this is a major disappointment.alot of the characters stories litterally stand still or go in circles & theres lots of wandering around with no end product to the characters searches/quests.glad im finished it & onto the next one i only hope its better than this book.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I bought this book for myself, and then bought it for my friend who was going through some hard times. It's funny, light read, sweet, and just a great representation of Ellen.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|It took about 5 listens but am now in love. Really enjoy the evolution of their sound and was not disappointed here. Plus, buying through Amazon got me pre-sale access to their new tour and got me some sweet tickets for the Canadian dates.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Smiling is my favorite! And I do a lot of smiling while watching this movie. It's funny, sweet, and has a fun message. Will Ferrell is brilliant and it's well cast.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Good audio and visuals, no problems with the download<br /> Plot is ok. Overall a good movie to watch and relax!!
6305428042|5.0|This is my favorite Halloween movie. Best watched with friends and children. Great movie, though very 90s. I watch it every year.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book had a profound effect on me. It reminded me of how fragile it all is, life, love, happiness... to say I loved it would be wrong. I liked it alot, but I loved its message. The way Piccult writes is truely spectacular. The history behind each character and the layers of truth, simply awe striking. This is one of those books that changes at each turn bringing to light a new detail that suddenly becomes the most important part of the story. Yes, it made me cry, but I think a little crying is good once in a while.this book was a truly amazing acomplishment.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Ok so I hardly ever review albums but I felt I needed to review this one. I like a lot of rock and metal music. I like 3 days grace and I really liked their first stuff. It seems that most bands these days that get played on the radio lose their creativity and start to just spit stuff out to appease the masses every year and get paid but this album was actually pretty good. I didn't give it 5 stars because it wasn't just like I couldn't stop listening to it, but I do enjoy the album and most of the songs are enjoyable and I like listening to it quite a bit still. Most albums coming out these days have 1 or 2 good songs and the rest are just filler to fill up the disc space, not this album. This album is a solid rock album with good lyrics, some good ballads, some catchy songs, and still creative! I say it's a worthy album of owning if you are into this type of band and genre.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's work and this is no exception. Percy Jackson and the Olympians was amazing and I was sure he would be unable to follow it, but as I read further into the series I find myself enjoying it more than the first one. The only downside for me for this book was the cliff hanger at the end of this story and the wait to House of Hades (October 8th 2013). I like all of the characters and how developed they all are. I love Rick Riordan's sense of humor and the adventure in this book is awesome. I have spent all 7 mounths since I read it waiting fervishly for House of Hades and when it became avalabe for pre-order I bought it excitedly. I love how Riordan still uses a prophecy in each book besides the Great Prophecy (Seven halfbloods shall answer the call. To storm or fire, the world must fall. An oath to keep with a final breath, When foes bear arms to the doors of death.) I esspecialy liked the prophecy in this one. (Wisdome's daughter walks alone, The Mark of Athena burns through Rome. Twins snuff out the angels breath, Who holds the key to endless death. Giant's bane stand gold and pale, Won thrugh pain and a woven jail.) It was amazing how he made every word of this prophecy come true, ( I know all of the others came true as well but this one impressed me for some reason.) Aaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE HOUSE OF HADES!!!!!!!!! This is a wonderful book and you should read it but it will make a lot more senceif you read Percy Jackson and the Olympians and the reat of The Heroes of Olympus series first.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|All i can really say is that it works. It keeps my Kindle Fire protected when i'm not using it and it fits easily. I highly recommend it.
1439153663|1.0|Stereotyped characters, unbelievable plot, flat prose. With the great reviews I thought there must be something wrong with me and the novel would pick up after a bit but it never did. A big snore.

B00000428L|4.0|Although Kubrick used this recording for his movie 2001, its impact world-wide came with the Berlin Philharmonic performance, marketed by DG, who made a mint from selling this incarnation to the world as the 2001 fanfare. But I wonder just how important it is to emphasise \\"the original\\"? Only for movie buffs, I dare say. And then for only about 2 minutes worth of fun, not for a \\"work\\"!<br />For the discriminating listener the fanfare is the highlight of the tone poem, the only other excitement coming with the bitonality of the closing pages. In between we have to endure lots of laboured pseudo-philosophical, uninspired plodding by the craftsman Strauss in a futile attempt at writing \\"intellectual\\" music. Until this recording appeared, most experts on Strauss' music agreed that it is the weakest of all his mature symphonic poems. Amazing what a difference 2 or so minutes can make to the perceptions of the public!<br />The other two works, however, Don Juan and Till Eulenspiegel (which are hardly ever mentioned in Amazon reviews), belong among his most successful compositions. Both of these performances are by a conductor still relatively young, and still a very \\"hungry\\" and ambitious podium lion. Karajan was still on the upward slopes of the conductor's Mt Everest when they were made. And so the Don's \\"superbia\\" is superbly managed, with just the right amount of passion and brio, tenderness and restlessness, and a wonderfully apt attention to the innumerable orchestral colours from Strauss' rich palette. Till is a little short of fun, but full of the gruff burlesque that seems more appropriate to Strauss' Bavarian sensibility - although the contemporary account of Kempe with the Berlin Philharmonic conveys all this much better with its uproarious fizz and breathtaking instrumental virtuosity.<br />Karajan recorded all three of these works again in Berlin, for DG. The sound is a great improvement on the Decca album, and the Zarathustra arguably comes off better in thecomparison. However for Don Juan and Till, Karajan does not find the same urgency and ardour, or impetuosity, as in Vienna. There are episodes of flabbiness now which testify to his growing desire to paint the works in more beautiful colours, at the expense of forward drive. Once again Kempe, with the Staatskapelle Dresden, is there with accounts that do a little more than serving as rival recordings. Kempe conveys with total conviction the pacing that is somewhat slackened off in Karajan's readings, and the splendour of his orchestra seems at least to my ears pip the Berliners to the post on this occasion.<br />Just going back for a moment to the 1960 mark, a reminder for lovers of \\"classics\\" may not be amiss, therefore I mention that Fritz Reiner is also a strong contender in these stakes. His Zarathustra is surprisingly demure in the fanfare, compared to Karajan; but he conducts the rest of the work in eminently authentic style. His Don Juan from 1959 may well be the finest ever put on disk, not a note out of place and a glorious tapestry of sound. The Till, which he recorded in Vienna, is a disappointment. In this work, he is entirely humourless and must yield to both Kempe and Karajan.<br />Between these three conductors, much depends on what you expect to hear. If Zarathustra is your main bill of fare, then Karajan's Berlin recording with its more ample and analytical sounds and the absence of extraneous noises would seem to be preferable to the Decca/Vienna version. For Don Juan my vote goes to Reiner, though Kempe follows hard upon his heels. In Eulenspiegel, Kempe is on his own. Finally, if you wish to have all three in a \\"classic\\" recording, I feel that Kempe, consistently maintaining the highest standard and attunement, would have to be your man.
B00B69UQJY|2.0|If you wanna a great cd, get OMD new cd, delta machine, kinda boring, slow, and Omd new cd much better. check it out. Dep Mode needs to kick it up. sorry. Omd new cd is a great cd, it feels like dep mode keeps missing the mark. gone is the good fun beat, songs that make you wanna dance. Now it all dark and dull. The songs have no hook. even Erasure cd have been so much better. Dep Mode. Pick up the beat, your last 4 cd have been dull. I am ready to give up on buying anymore of there cd, and they can just be  an oldies 80 group. STEP IT UP. OMD new cd English Electric is so much better than this cd. dep mode new cd, sounds lazy and not very good. GUYS, lets give the fans what they want. not this.....
B000003FIQ|5.0|I've had my doubts about Heifetz -- and I don't mean to suggest that I'm alone. Heifetz divided opinion for half a century, between those who believed him to represent the acme of violinistic musicality and others who felt that he evinced a sore lack of emotional involvement in his artistry. I personally incline to the second of these opinions, but not altogether. It may be that Heifetz responds more deeply to some music. It seems that particular works affect him, rather than general categories of music. For example, his recordings of Elgar and Rozsa, Bruch's Scottish Fantasy and the SIbelius Concerto seem to me to bring out the best of the musician, rather than just the virtuoso.<br />So now I have mentioned Sibelius, I still have to bring up the virtuosic feature of his playing first. All other recordings I own, evince signs of stress in the opening cadenza; and even in some of the best digital recordings, the fiddle can sound painfully hard. Not here. Whatever his secret was, Heifetz has no trouble surmounting the impediments to a clean delivery. The same considerations apply, naturally to the two other longish episodes when the violin holds the fort. However, by itself this would not move me -- his tone is the same in Beethoven, Brahms and Mendelssohn, where it leaves me quite cold.<br />This is the point where words should come to the rescue -- where the crucial issue comes up. What does this man communicate? And all I can say (as my very subjective impression) that Heifetz just manages to get under the skin of this music in a way that none other can. This is not a technical issue, because it has relevance to the soul of the work. It strikes me that Heifetz projects the yearning, the reaching out of the violin to your heart, but also the gloom that intervenes every so often, with rare fidelity. The slow movement is songful and passionate in an unobtrusive way (too many performers become over-rhetorical here); the \\"polonaise for a polar bear\\", as one critic called it, is discharging with flying colours and really quite exciting.<br />I am of the view that with music it is impossible to call any performance on record \\"the best\\". It always annoys me when I see those silly words in the heading of a review, as if we were dealing with a well-made chair or a new model motor car. And so I will refrain here, except to say that I have not ever heard a recorded performance \\"better\\" than this.<br />The sound is very good, too; and the Chicago Symphony discharge their duty with accustomed precision, even though it was Hendl rather than Reiner in charge that day.<br />When this album first hit the market on LP, in 1960, you paid full price for just the Sibelius. Today you get Prokofiev and Glazunov thrown in. So lucky we are today!<br />The Prokofiev is a \\"typical\\" Heifetz performance -- meaning, undoubtedly a superior rendering, but not as conspicuously sympathetic as the Sibelius. But it will not leave you asking for \\"better\\", only (perhaps) for \\"different\\". I frankly don't love this concerto so much as to look for another (I also have Milstein playing it, nowhere near as good). The third concerto here, by Glazunov, fares very badly. To judge by his playing, Heifetz must really dislike it. It is a tuneful, elegant and sad little oeuvre, but Heifetz rushes through as if he couldn't wait to get it over and done with.<br />No matter. Think of it as a fill-up. The other two works are worth having whatever the price.
B000SW4DLM|3.0|Keep in mind this movie is over 30 years old at the time of this writing. The film's Sci-Fi theme is a frequently told tale of purpose in life and resisting mortality. I would suggest &#34;Moon&#34; for a more modern take.
B00BV2LY1U|5.0|As usual, David Baldacci has another book I couldn't put down.  Fast moving, dynamic and with enough twist and turns to keep your attention.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie followed the book more closely than Peter Jackson followed the &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34;  It was a delight to watch.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|We are Les Mis junkies...<br /><br />Hate movie theaters so I love this product. Acting part was great, but if you compare the stage singing to the movie it will always fall short. Let's just say the movie explained the play much better if you are not up to reading the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've seen a lot of bad reviews on here for the latest update. But I like it. I haven't had any problems and I can see the whole weeks weather at a glance. No technical problems either.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This version has the best &#34;On my own&#34; version. Not shrilly and has the best tone. It was performed by Lea Salonga who played Fantine in the 25th anniversary which I also have.<br /><br />Also, like that I can listen to Colm Wilkenson anytime I want...<br /><br />This is in my car and is not allowed to be taken out :)
B002BWP49C|5.0|They really did it this time!  This is the best film of the Twilight Saga.  It surprised me and I really enjoy it.<br /><br />I have no words to rate this film.<br /><br />YOU MUST BUY IT!!! beause you will want to see it more than once.<br /><br />Great job.  Everyone that worked to bring this film to be what it is.
0525478817|5.0|John Green beautifully weaves the tales of cancer patients living life to the fullest. Never do you feel like these characters are fake, and you will become very invested in their lives. He does a wonderful job of making you laugh and cry at the same time. You will feel ALL THE THINGS!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movie is funny, touching and all around enjoyable.<br />I recommend it. You will spend a good time watching it
B001M5UDGS|5.0|When the writer's strike forced people off television, Joss took that time to make something for the internet. This was that something. It is funny, heartbreaking, and wonderful. Neil Patrick Harris does a wonderful job in the title role, Nathan Fillion does a great job as his nemesis, and Felicia Day portrays the love interest beautifully.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I love Robert Taylor and in this movie he outdid himself.  It is enjoyable and unforgetable.<br /><br />I recommend people to buy it
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Serenity is the movie sequel to the television show Firefly, and it does a wonderful job of giving closure to those of us who miss the show.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie teaches that it doesn't matter who you are, how much money you have or don't have to do something for someone if you see them as a person with a heart and a mind. It teaches you to see in others the possibilities instead of the disadvantages and to help, if you can, that individual to become what they can be.<br /><br />This movie taught me a great lesson that I believe many people need learn.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|A bit of a stylistic departure from Opus, Ghost really branches out, using pop, surf and carnivalesque motifs in their songwriting. While lyrically this album remains firmly rooted in Satanism, we find the music itself has become a lot less heavy and more melodic. I think this transition might alienate people who expect to hear metal or \\"doom\\", which with they have been erroneously associated in the past. The songs on Infestissumam really showcase the band's talent and catapult them out of the pigeonhole of ye olde heavy metal band. Perhaps sick of hearing regurgitated B.O.C. and Fate comparisons, they stepped up their songwriting and now sound like themselves. A couple of weak points aside, this album is pure brilliance and is destined to be cherished for generations to come.
B000AMPX4G|5.0|I never thought that a film could touch me the way this one did.  The love of a father to hide from his child the terrible hell he was living.<br />A good, touching movie.  I recommend it.
0807126063|4.0|My friend, with whom I share a lot in common (comically), told me this was the funniest book he'd ever read. I can't say that I agree.<br /><br />The book had plenty of moments, almost all of them having to do with the protagonist, I.J. Reilly, but most of my experiences with the protagonist were spent trying to decide whether I liked him or hated him. He was pitiful but malicious, genuine but scripted, impassioned but lazy...so many contradictions in one character that I eventually gave up trying to enjoy the book and just tried to finish it. I'm glad I finished it, though, because the end of the book kind of tilted my feelings on Reilly one final time in his favor. It was the darkness of the comedy in this book that made it readable. It it had been penned as a traditional comedy, or had included any extra color or optimism, I'd never have finished it.<br /><br />The book gets 4-stars, losing one for lack of consistency (and therefore my attention) and for what I consider to be erroneous fanfare surrounding the book. I might have docked it by two stars, but Toole never even saw the book published, so his work shouldn't be held accountable for unmet expectations. Still, I'd love to prove a point to all those groupthink readers who marginally enjoyed it but still rated it as if it were one of the best books they ever read.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|it was really interesting and exciting and a bit creepy but I loved it! I'm making all my friends watch it.
B000002U82|5.0|Look, it's all been said before: greatest concept album of all time, most successful musical experiment in history, Pink Floyd's magnum opus....<br /><br />And you know what, they're all right. So you need to add this album to your collection if you have not already done so, because a music fan not owning this album is like an Anglican not owning a Book of Common Prayer.
B000URWYTS|5.0|Beautifully written, good on historical context and very interesting on the protagonists. It has been an incentive for me to read more about the life and works of Frank Lloyd Wright.

B0073TZ1AA|3.0|It does what it says. Nothing too special. It does a great job of breaking down the PDF into single sentences. It nicely displays what sentence it is currently reading to you. It would be nice if it displayed the original PDF and highlighted the sentence it was on.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Good production value - probably historically accurate, but very, very slow. I almost fell asleep. The action scene when they finally got Bin Ladin was shot so dark I couldn't see anything. It took 9 years to catch him and it seemed as if this movie lasted as long.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The book tells the story of compassion and courage in the midst of the terror of WWII.  I enjoyed seeing that German airmen could have solid,moral scruples derived from their Christian beliefs though they were serving Hitler's evil regime.  The book is well written by Alex Makos and reads like a novel rather than a biography of German fighter pilot Franz Stigler.  His compassion toward Charlie Brown's B-17 was uplifting and courageous.  But Makos did a great job detailing Stigler's Catholic upbringing, his chivalrous code of conduct, his disillusionment with the Nazis, that all worked to help the reader understand where he was coming from when he encountered Brown's B-17.  The latter part of the book, where Stigler and Brown finally, after the war, meet each other and become the best of friends is quite emotional.  It really got to me!!  I loved this book!!
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|so so liked last album much better. Not into the rap incorporated into two of the songs. Expected much more.................................
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is my first Colleen Hoover book and I rather enjoyed it.  The characters developed nicely and the story was deep. Holder and Sky's relationship was sometimes confusing but not distractingly so.  Miss Hoover writes well about a sensitive subject and the ending was a good one.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Brought back memories of the 1960's when I was the age of the characters in this movie. High definition and dolby added to the impressive musical adaptation. The photography was especially notable as were as the dramatic special effects. Recommend it highly.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book, exploring love and friendship intertwined then unraveling.<br />Jodi is a master of letting you into her characters, I enjoy them on an emotional level, I know them.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Every song in this album is incredible!  You listen to one and say to yourself, Wow that was great.  Then you listen to the next song and say, wow that was just as great or better.  No bad song in this album.  He has evolved into an amazing artist.  Can't wait til the next one in the fall.  Which is why this is called the 20/20 Experience, he wrote 20 songs and is dividing them into two albums.  Yay!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like the concept in this game, and the quests give it a nice extra quality. The energy takes a while to recharge so you shouldn't expect to play her often (two or three times a day) unless you want to pay. But the quests, story, and collections keep you coming back.

B003DNN0L2|5.0|On a recent long-distance flight, I gorged on a bunch of movies.  The one that blew me away was this one.  I'd heard and known about the inventiveness of The Fantastic Mr. Fox's stop-action animation.  What I was not prepared for was the script: it is sneaky smart with elements of both understated humor and outright hilarity.  Nor was I prepared for just how brilliant the vocal characterizations were.  I hope George Clooney got some type of award for this film, because, wow, what a performance.  The character he gives his 'Mr. Fox' -- hard to put your finger on exactly how he did it, but his mere voice gives our hero equal bits of dash, street smarts, world-weariness and hope for a better future. Bravo.<br /><br />Three memories which had me doubled-up with laughter on my flight:<br /><br />The tree-, er, house-buying strategy session with badger (and lawyer, natch) Bill Murray - the \\"Are you cussing with me\\"? scene - which quickly devolves into animal behavior until a well-timed 'ding' off the carriage return of Murray's deadpan secretary defuses the hostile atmosphere.<br /><br />Owen Wilson's inimitable intonations dispassionately rattling off the arcane rules of the sport of 'Whackbat.'<br /><br />Clooney's Mr. Fox having a understated breakfast conversation with his wife (an equally sublime performance from Meryl Streep), concluding his point in very human-like fashion, then...ravenously demolishing his waffles like you'd imagine a fox doing given the opportunity. An unexpected, burst-out-loud funny moment.

The writing could be a little more refined - it's not one of those books where you feel like you could be a character in the book, the author doesn't quite draw you in like that, but it's got potential!

This game walks you through the moves, shows the setup, shows the legal moves and allows you to refresh your memory quickly.  Oh and it is easy to play on the road, on the plane or anywhere else when you find yourself stuck waiting.  Great little game if you like backgammon.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this book and I was pleasantly surprised.  I did feel the issue of mental illness was sugarcoated, but the struggles that the two main characters went through felt real.  I would recommend this for a light read.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The book holds your interest as you don't know what the main character did to end up in an institution.  You can really get a sense of the disfunction with the father and you wonder what influence that had on the main character as well as he was pretty self involved before &#34;the incident&#34;.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|The Smile Sessions was a Birthday gift to my Oldest Nephew, And it went over BIG TIME! He 's really enjoying it and has become a big Beach Boys and Brian Wilson fan... :-)
B000V39KDO|5.0|I made my order on Friday and my estimated delivery was the following Wednesda. I got home from work on Monday and there was my package. Very fast delivery and not a scratch on my movie. I was very impressed.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A great read, I highly recommend to anyone looking for a simply enjoyable book that keeps you interested from beginning to end.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I like this movie for several reasons.  First of all, t's based on reality.  Secondly, it's got just the right balance of intrigue, action, and suspense.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|great for finding out what the weather is going to be for the week and can plan time off from work.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this mic to record some video interviews and it works great. I would definitely buy another one for a back-up mic.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Reads like fiction and is a fascinating account of everyday lives of North Korean people. Would highly recommend this book.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game every night to wind down before going to sleep. My favorite game ! You should download it now!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I recommend to all my friends, interesting love story, very entertaining and romantic... Love love loved it! could read it over and over again, hope the movie is as good as the books
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this game, very relaxing.  Good game to pass the time when you are waiting around.  Glad I tried it.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|This movie not only demonstrated Streisands superb acting ability it also showcased her perfection in directing.  This movie was way before its time.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|I definitely would watch on a device where you can get the HD, though. The non-HD quality was not good.
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|Graphics were bad. Costumes were poor. Ended at an unusual time. The next ones must get better. Does not follow book.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I'm sure many people who have read the book agree it was so much better than the movie. The movie itself was not suspenseful, didn't really keep me that captivated, & actually felt awkward to watch... However, it did a \\"good enough\\" job, I suppose, for 3 stars. It wasn't awful, but I'm definitely glad I didn't pay to watch it in theaters!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great show. Good picture quality. I like that it has captioning available. I only wish season 3 was available as it airs!
B004T0E2S8|5.0|Cleanly done and well charted tabs and chords to many classics and current day songs. Was able to find things I'd been looking for easily with the search screen. You have your choice of how to play one song many different ways. A good app for beginners and professionals alike.
B00174TKGI|5.0|When I first saw American Gangster in the theaters I immediately made it one of my top 10 movies!  It was great to see an uncut, unrated version.  A nice surprise with all that extra footage!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Really liked this movie. Kids really enjoyed it. I would recommend it for family movie night. Not for younger children but for teens and up.
0452273331|5.0|and Fountainhead in particular.  In fact, I am re-reading it right now.  this was a present for a high school graduate - get to them early!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have sung the praises of Public Television since my youth when first I saw a National Geographic special...I don't quite &#34;get&#34; British Humor, however no one can dispute the allure of a beautifully spoken British dialect! Channel surfing one evening I came across an episode of &#34;Downton&#34; and have been salivating for more of this fabulous dish since! How true it is that when all the money, castles and clothing are stripped away, we are really all quite similar in our basest needs, wants and desires. The &#34;good&#34; among us anyway....as for the &#34;bad seeds&#34;, well, I'm certa sayin they have their &#34;reasons for being&#34; I suppose one of those reasons would be to make the rest of the lot look even better!<br /><br />The cast is fabulous, (some new to me; I'm reading bio's now) a Harry Potter fan would naturally be drawn to the fantastic Maggie Smith just for their allegiance to Professor McGonagal! This by far one of the best period dramas to come along in a long, long, time...don't be left out of the water cooler conversation, buy it now and be &#34;in the loop&#34; as they say!
031620157X|5.0|I was introduced to this book by my 8 year old son, who read it for school.  It's WONDERFUL.  Even more impressive is this is the author's first novel, and I think the author is either young, and actor, or both.  That's just a nice factoid; the real joy is in the book itself.  I hope he writes a sequel!
B001M0HGR2|1.0|I bought it to play on my roku player a HD version and the playback did not have any sound..... However my roku player was fine as I was able to play other videos properly. The HD version has a problem because I was able to play the non HD version with sound.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Not the best acting and over the top humor. Unrealistic and the only funny parts are in the trailer. Not my cup of tea.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Love JT.  Love this album more than I thought I would.  Immediately started listening to it on my cloud player and haven't stopped.<br />The cd arrived timely, but the case was cracked.
B002OR0RP0|1.0|The movie would not play at all I tried about 8 times.  The message read to call Amazon customer service.  The preview played just fine and other movies did also.  I've heard that Amazons been slowing down compared to the other on line movie hosts lately but did not believe it until now.  I gave it one star, but only because that's the minimum.  I have other movies that I have purchased also, hope this does not start happening with them!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book definitely took a direction I was not anticipating. Well written but not the fairy tale I was truly hoping for and expecting.
0061122416|3.0|I read this book a long time ago. It's a good, spiritual book, which i think was intended for children. So to see adults tearing it apart is rather strange. The core value and lesson still hold true, however.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Stephen King is the undisputed king of popular fiction.  His non-fiction serving here is something of an ode to the craft as well as a revealing account of the man's life.  While I am not certain how much anyone can actually \\"learn\\" the craft of writing, King's book sure offers a boost of enthusiasm to newly-published authors such as myself.<br /><br />Jeffrey Littorno<br />http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Hostage-ebook/dp/B00BLAE7N4/
0892818875|5.0|This book is an absolute delight and is much more than I expected. It gives us some therapeutic foundations and goes onto explain where emotional and mental problems originate in our bodies. The author talks about each essential oils signature and explains how each one works in regards to our emotions and mental well-being. The third section explains the blending for the well being of our emotional and mental balance and provides a few blends for each.<br /><br />Some people may think this is \\"too\\" Zen or \\"too\\" traditional oriental however many people suffer from their emotions being out of balance which often lead to physical problems; this book helps to understand that imbalance and gives us some understanding in correcting them through the use of essential oils.<br /><br />Well written, easy to understand, and provides excellent information. I will be using this book as a reference often. I have already found and used a suggested blend for someone who \\"over thinks\\" while trying to sleep...they have already noticed a difference.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Any family with children will be moved by this real story. Hard to believe it is a true story. Very brave 10 year old helps save himself and his mother.

B005FDXT32|5.0|A real classic, great movie and probably one of Al Pacino's best roles. One to add to your collection. A real winner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the few series that both of us liked.<br /><br />We watched on Amazon and watched an episode or two a day until they were all gone.<br /><br />Cant wait to see more!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This car charger works great. I like that it has specific technology inside to charge Apple/Android devices in the best way possible. No complaints but I wish it looked &#34;less Apple-like&#34; - e.g. different color choices would be cool!<br /><br />Edit: I've since bought the newest version of this charger for our other car and I was able to get it in black - great!
B005LAIIJY|3.0|Movie started out great.........I mean great!  Serious parts..funny parts!  They stretched it out too long and it became boring at the end.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|This movie is one of the reasons I'm in law school.  Of course, I'm pretty sure that soliciting work in a hospital like that is unethical, but I haven't taken ethics yet, so who knows!
B004HW7JH4|4.0|The stories and acting are excellent. The production values are very good. This series is thought provoking on so many levels.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|So far, this is an excellent Sci-Fi series. I love it! I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Sci-Fi.
0812993845|5.0|I loved this book, because it was so much fun to read! I got it Friday night and finished it Saturday. The only problem is that now I'm sad it's over! I laughed out loud and really just enjoyed the story. I can't wait for her next book!
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|What's wrong with this movie? I don't see nothin' wrong with it. It's really good. I never expected bad reviews from critics. This Die Hard movie goes hard.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Quentin Tarantino, when he's off his game, remains a better movie maker than almost anyone else.  However, there are problems with Django and Tarantino's recent trend to emphasize style and reference at the expense of depth.  This might be why many were offended by scenes where slaves are tortured when the rest of the movie is &#34;let's see if I can make a 1960s Spaghetti Western.&#34;  As to its other controversies:  Yes there is a lot of the N word, but remember most of the characters are dumb racist hicks (albeit one-dimensional racist hicks).  I wasn't distracted by the other harsh language, except when it became too &#34;modern&#34; (I'm not sure a house slave would say motherf***** for example).  The violence, in some cases, is over the top but at other times uncomfortable even for Tarantino (maybe to contrast cartoon excess with real shock, I don't know).  My biggest problems with the movie are pacing and lack of editing--or maybe lack of self-editing.  Like Inglorious Basterds, there is a certain pointlessness to Django.  Other movies by Tarantino have long conversational segments but the dialogue aids the plot and develops character.  In Django, however, there are unneeded scenes (how many bounty hunting events do we need in the first half of the movie before we know how a man becomes who he is?).  The obsession with revenge also takes away from the movie.  In Kill Bill 2 there is a great break-up discussion before Bill is killed by his ex.  In Django Jamie Foxx just shoots an important character in the knees without the essential discussion about race and exploitation that was hinted at all along (they don't even have this talk after the knees are shot off).  Overall, then, you get some good moments interspersed with a lot of down time or slow pacing and a certain shallowness.  When this movie is played over and over on cable, you wont stop to watch it like you find yourself doing every time you come across Pulp Fiction.  On the plus side, I'm more and more impressed by Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Johnson was a pleasant surprise, and nothing undermines racism like a protracted argument over improper hoodwear for a lynching.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|I love Jane Austin and this is a great read - glad it was free so I didn't have to pay again after owning the hardcover.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am not too sure how to stand out and say the magic words that haven't been said about this book in the thousands of other reviews. I can say that I wanted to keep reading this book. It is truly a twisted take on a love story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever you can build houses find coal,gold,iron,diamonds,and kill creepers,zombies,Skeltons.kill cows to get meat, kill or sheer sheep to get wool,kill pigs to get bacon.
B003VANOFY|1.0|the headset is nice, fits nice, feels nice to wear... but it has too many problems with actually using. Multiple times in any one session the headset loses connection to the transmitter... Ive been on forums and all sorts of people have a lot of different ideas on whats happening, but the point is, it happens to a lot of people, not just me.<br /><br />because the design is made to be simple so there is no channel changing to try to fix things. you have no options. the product ether works for you or it does not, and when it does not work its the most annoying thing that drives you nuts, from going silent suddenly to the little beep it has on reconnecting, multiple beeps when it fails to reconnect and retries.<br /><br />the few times it works, it sounds great, its a nice headset, when it works. but for me it spends most of its time reconnecting and as such not useable for me.
B004LROUNG|4.0|excellent story. great summer reading.  the issues are timely and relevant. makes you think when you see the legal adds on television &#34;if you are injured in an accident call...!&#34;
0201721481|3.0|I am commenting this book as a product, not as a college textbook.<br /><br />This copy is FULL of misprints and misplaced comments! Some codes don't even match the explanations. For experienced coders who have already known quite a bit about C or Java, none of these could've had actual impact on understanding those ideas of the writers, but it can be really confusing to newbies.<br /><br />Poor explanation on Multi-dimensional pointers. Fair treatment of OOP.<br /><br />I haven't read the latest edition, hope it'd get better than this.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />IMHO, \\"Thinking in C++\\" is better and its free!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Bought this for my son and now he is just about invincible. This thing can withstand attacks and keep spinning un-phased. I would highly recommend this bey for anyone interested in having a dominant force in their arsenal.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I've got to admit that when I first heard about &#34;Walking Dead&#34; I thought there was no way I would be watching more than one episode of a show about a zombie apocalypse. Wrong! From the first minute of the first show I was hooked. I can't watch them fast enough and am almost done with Season 3.  The &#34;walkers&#34; are obviously a key factor in the series however the dynamics of the survivors and the interactions of the main characters is what keeps the series from becoming just another zombie movie.  Just when you think you've got it all figured out, another twist is thrown at you and you're back to the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Warning... this series is highly addictive.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I chose this rating because I didn't have the option for ZERO stars!! Was there a manual that I missed?? This app never worked even when all systems were in place.  I would NOT recommend this app.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I am a huge fan of Linkin Park and I bought this to complete my collection. Amazing album, glad I bought it.
B00B23O96A|5.0|This CD feels very intimate to me. Like when you have friends over and someone pulls out their guitar. They try to find a song everyone remembers so we can all sing along. Love his voice on Born to Lose and also Goodnight Irene. Love that he did songs with friends. Loved hearing his daughters sing on Every Little Thing which was written by his friend Doyle Bramhall II. Like I said, this is a very intimate gift we have received from our friend Eric Clapton. And thank you very much Eric.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My son Loves it. It is his favorite game. It is like Farmville but with dragons, making it more interesting for boys.
B00005JLEU|5.0|By far my favorite out of all of Miyazaki's awesome movies. Having viewed most of the Studio Ghibli films, this one stands out no contest as the #1 classic. Although all of the Ghibil films are worth watching, Spirited Away is the title that brings me back to a better age of animated films time after time. I highly recommend this movie to both kids of young ages and also adults who can keep an open mind and truly marvel at the beauty of this animated film which can truly bring out the inner child in you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book. Full of surprises. I never imagined the story going in this direction. Very interesting, surprising detailed story with lit  of twist and turns
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|good easy to use and you needed to clean up what ever  you use it for, free program so try it nothing to loose
B000T433CO|5.0|Loved this movie...talk about opposites attract...this movie is a perfect example of that....money doesn't buy you love...friendships do...it makes you wonder if you really know yourself at all...

B00BOX0K0M|4.0|Great accessory!  Was hesitant at first, but am glad I bought one.  Filter snaps on and off with ease.  I used it at the beach, and made a big difference.  A lot less glare.  Going to try it surfing soon!

0385349831|5.0|If you have an hour or two, then you have time to enjoy this thoroughly delightful little book.  Mr. Coehlo has written a book which is deceptively easy.  It is a very fast read! But like a hot chili pepper it has undercurrents that present later when you have time reflect on what's there.<br />The book purports to be a transcript found by a Sir Walter Wilkinson, who discovered it in Accra, the same location where the Dead Sea Scrolls, also known as the Nag Hammadi Library, were found.  A quick search for Sir Walter online produced only references to reviews and other items that reference the novel I am reviewing - so one assumes that the work is purely Mr. Coehlo's - it is, after all being marketed as a novel.<br />Regardless of its provenance, \\"Manuscript Found in Accra\\" is well worth reading.  The narrator places the story on the eave of an invasion by Crusaders in the city of Jerusalem, and consists almost entirely of a question and answer session between the people of Jerusalem, and a mysterious fellow called only \\"The Copt\\", who answers questions asked by the townfolk.<br />The answers he gives are thoughtful, intelligent and intriguing.  You may not agree with everything the Copt says, but his answers will certainly resonate with your own thoughts and give you plenty to think about for yourself.<br />For example: Mr. Coehlo ends a chapter talking about defeat with this thought: \\"Scars speak more loudly than  the sword that caused them.\\" It is a thought which opens many doors.<br />This is the sort of book that you will want to keep around near your bed, or on a table near your sofa so that you can pick it up and browse it again and again.  Each time it will offer you something new and interesting.
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|I can't stop listening to REVO.  Walk Off The Earth has incredible talent and chemistry.  I stumbled on the \\"Big Guitar\\" video of Red hands on you-tube and I have been hooked every since.  I went ahead and ordered the whole album on CD.  The style varies from song to song so there is never any boredom.  I love the whole album, but my favorites right now are Red Hands and Sometimes.  I hope this group continues to do what they're doing.

B002ZHKZEC|5.0|Tennant was an amazing Doctor (however Matt is and ever will be my fav) and this is a must have for those who love the overall series. I will add that the good specials on here are Waters of Mars and End of time Pt. 1 and 2, the Next Doctor and Planet of the dead are rather sorry additions to the story. Other than the fact that the of Planet of the dead contributes to the leading up to the end of 10th regenerations life. Also this is a blu-ray only, if you buy it on dvd you are only hurting youself. Waters of Mars and The end of time pt 1 and 2 are the first Doctor who episodes to be formatted in an HD quality. The other 2 were merely converted, bt if you love watching things in a super cripsy sexy format then this is worth it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I missed the first 2 seasons so this was the perfect way to catch up. I'll definitely watch it more than once.
0375869026|5.0|My 9 year old insisted I read this book.  He said it was the best book ever.  I have to agree that it is one of the top ten I have ever read in my life.  I won't say more.  Anything else I say is a spoiler, because the author has done the most wonderful job of revealing the story of her hero to us.  This book is imaginative, profound, heartwarming, well-written, a pleasure to read (out loud was great--my son and I taking turns).  I am buying copies of this to send to friends, young and old.  Thank you R.J. Palacio.  Please write us another...<br />P.S.  I NEVER write reviews--but I couldn't help but proclaim how worthy this book is of being read by everyone and anyone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Having bought the first 2 seasons, I needed to keep going. This will be a permanent part of my library.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This game is so entertaining, I actually put the wrong letters just to see the drawings.  There are many categories, and my 8 year old enjoys it as much as I do!
B00B9JDBSO|5.0|Clearly this is not for every moment. The Knife have been etching away from their pop sensibilities for years. With Shaking The Habitual they have, perhaps, made their .... (I want to say Kid A, but I also want to say this only in brackets). There is nothing easy about this album. And for this reason, this album should be avoided in easy contexts. Do not listen to this album when making dinner. Do not put it on when hosting a dinner party, trying to imp with your music up-to-dated-ness. Do not insist that a friend listen to it right-then-and-now. Do not play this while eating olives and crackers. It will backfire.<br /><br />But I think it's worth giving this album a serious listen. Much like, in recent memory, it is worth giving the Swans' \\"The Seer\\" a serious listen. This music, as so much great music, great art, really, needs space. Give it space. It is best at those moments of solitude. But it doesn't have to be a solitary experience, at the elimination of everything else. I mean, listen while doing something you love. Listen while writing. While drawing. While potting. Plants. Painting. Clicking through links and links and links and links online. Whatever. Watch a hockey or football game on mute. Watch a fashion show on cable. Let your eyes and mind do one thing while the music does another.<br /><br />The Knife's latest album is not for every moment. But it can be for every person -- perhaps given the right moment. And the right state of mind.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|It's uncontrollably catchy, and will have you singing and dancing all week! I seriously just played it on repeat and didn't listen to any other albums for like two weeks. Their sounds kind of got me into Afro pop and expanded my musical taste. It's great for parties and gatherings, I haven't had one person that I've played their music for that didn't like it.  Definitely my favorite album of theirs!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|COWBOY'S IN SPACE, IT WORKED WITH CLASSIC STAR TREK AND IT SHOULD HAVE WORKED HERE.  THIS SHOW WILL LIVE ON FOREVER AND WILL BE WATCHED LONG AFTER SPLASH, THE KARDASHIANS, OR SOME OTHER CURRENT POPULAR DRIVEL.  TV IS A VAST WASTELAND AND THIS SHOW DESERVED BETTER.  A POX ON THE TV EXECUTIVES THAT RUN THE NETWORKS, HOW MUCH COKE MUST YOU INGEST BEFORE THE CURRENT CROP OF CRAP THAT IS POPULAR TV LOOKS GOOD.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD THE CHANCE TO CATCH THIS SERIES, GET IT NOW, BEFORE ITS ALL GONE!!!
B00000JR29|5.0|When I heard the song shout come through on Pandora I know I had to go out and grab the album right away. From the moment I pressed play I could tell that this album was going to be special. You can hear the detail and the care that was taken to create the album, and if you're in the mood for beautiful's 80s music, this is the album for you. Grab a glass of wine, light a candle, sit back and enjoy.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome.  Great read about brave men who served our country in a capacity that few can comprehend.  We owe these warriors  our full support and gratitude.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Dont get me wrong...I've enjoyed EVERY Reacher book I've read.  This is just a little better for me, though.  I suppose it's the collection of hard cases who are Reacher's friends. It's fun to watch them destroy and maime as a group.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love all of the hungry sharks but this is by far the best. For one, it is a complete version for free. Yes, there are in-app purchases available but you can achieve all of the sharks and levels without buying anything. Two, it's wildly entertaining. I've been playing every spare moment for the past week. I'm addicted. The only downside is the load time between rounds but the graphics and sounds are great with no lag or pixelation so I guess it's worth it. A++++
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Is delightfully entertaining. Kind of reminds one of the original Star Trek stories.<br />Fun to watch while exercising on the Tread Mill or Stair Stepper or sitting<br />eating popcorn, or as a mental escape to &#34;other worlds&#34;..
B0094K1MH2|4.0|The graphics/artistry of this movie are almost real like.<br />I enjoyed this movie, the sound is well done.<br />If you are into HT and have kids that like to watch this type of movie you and the kids will be well satisfied.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Pretty engaging, good cinematography & FX, OK story line. Doesn't require knowledge of the other Lord of the Rings stories. Good way to kill 3 hours.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I couldn't even watch the whole movie. It was just not funny! I was prepared for \\"bathroom\\" humor, but it's as if there weren't any jokes to begin with. The funny parts you saw in the trailer were all there was. I watched 1/2 before I quit. I'm mad - I will never get that wasted time back.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm pretty sure most people who might watch this movie already are aware that it's pretty awesome. If you've seen and liked the (first two) Iron Man movies, Thor, or Captain America, odds are good you will like this one. I have not personally seen the Hulk movie that ties in, but I heard it was also good. I highly recommend watching those movies first though; while it's not necessary to enjoy The Avengers, viewers will understand more of the events in the background. My sister had not seen the other movies first and so she didn't understand everything the first time she saw The Avengers. After we watched them though, and then watched this again, she had a deeper appreciation for the various plots.<br /><br />As for this blu-ray version, it is excellent. I got it on release day so it was on sale, and for $20 at the time, it was a lucky deal. We have a 55&#34; Samsung LED/LCD and the movie looks great on it. This also included the DVD which is nice if you want to take it somewhere or watch it on a device that doesn't have blu-ray. I haven't used the digital download but it's probably the most likely candidate for if I were going to go ahead and download a movie to keep on a laptop or whatever.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Have been a fan of Tarantino since RESERVOIR DOGS.  This movie ranks right up there with his best films.  It may even be his best film.  It touches every emotion.  It has everything.  I've been a fan of spaghetti westerns for a long time.  I even named my dog Jango after watching the orignal DJANGO with Franco Nero several years ago.  That's right.  With no \\"D\\" for my dog.  Wouldn't want to confuse the hillbillies.  Sounds crazy?  Get this.  When the movie was showing at our local theater,  when you called to get showtimes the recorded voice said \\"Duh-JANGO\\" UNCHAINED.  Now imagine my poor pooch getting lost and then someone reads the dog tag as Duh-JANGO instead Jango. Suppose the dog gets confused...then irritated.  Then maybe it snaps at the hillbilly unfamiliar with the pronunciation.  Maybe I get the dog back but face a lawsuit.  Jango=my dog.  DJANGO UNCHAINED=great movie.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|Another great James Bond movie! Great team to watch Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean.  I'll never get old to watch a James Bond movie.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's really aggravating when you have to delete stuff because it takes up so much memory. But when you get it you will say this is so worth it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Love the show just wish they would follow the scriptures in the bible more but still a great show<br />Hope they come out with a season 9
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie for adults and kids alike, very inspirational and have great scenes  the story is very unique, the pictures are wonderful and overall I greatly recommend this movie.
B000UKOBOQ|5.0|I like this. good buy. i think that anyone from the 80's should buy it, right now. It is cool.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|Like any other Robin Williams movie you can't go wrong with this movie but it's not a great movie and definitely not Robin's best one. Anyway, it's nice for older kids. The youngers will not survive the dull beginning or the too many details.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Homage to the spaghetti westerns of the sixties.  If you enjoyed the style of those classics, you'll love Django.  Done as only Tarantino can.  Superb cast from top to bottom.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|The movie was captivating throughout, very well written, directed and very well acted, each and every cast member did a fabulous job.
B003G8Y4QO|3.0|Tried it, but not my cup of tea. It was just a little too goofy for me. Good production value, but ultimately i didn't enjoy the storyline.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I picked this book based on a recommendation. I couldn't put it down once I started. It is well-written, fast paced and serves as a reminder to be engaged in your kid's online activities.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|This is great fantasy for any fan of a good story. A grand adventure story and interesting dialog. A good read.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Such a great rainy day/ before bed read! Great character development and<br />Very witty! Anothet great sophie read. Couldnt put it down!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Does this battery EVER die? I use this in Barbados and I have bought one for myself, one of my dearest friends AND one for my brother! The product is an excellent product. Very clear reception, excellent quality from far away. I LOVE IT!
B005LAIHR2|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because I think Tom Cruise is great in this movie - acting, swag, singing.  Otherwise the movie is uninteresting.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I begged my mom to buy me this then I told her about the Gore option and she let me buy it.
B002DEZXOE|4.0|Having seen the original film upon it's first release back in 1970, I would say that the \\"Director's Cut\\" is not quite as good as the movie.<br />Some of the tracks on this discs have been edited, and a few of the most popular riffs from Ten Years After and others are not as they were originally.<br />Janis Joplin was a letdown on this disc in my opinion, and I'm a huge fan of hers.<br />However, the \\"Bonus Disc\\" was worth the price of admission.<br />Santana, The Dead, Creedence, Johnny Winter, Joe Cocker, The Who, Airplane, etc. were an awesome addition to the original film.<br />Not bad for the price although blu ray was not earth shattering as was expected.
1616551151|5.0|I'm a fan of the table top Dragon Age game, so this is a nice book to have for players and I to reference during the game.  It's also just a really nice book.  The paper, print quality, and binding are very high quality.<br /><br />The only negative is that there is no new information (it just collects existing info you can get from the Dragon Age Wiki and other sources).  But, I think that's all it was intended to be:  a collection of information otherwise already released in one form or another so I wasn't really too shocked or disappointed.<br /><br />Again, great companion to have at the table while playing the RPG.  Also great as a collectible.  Probably nice to have as a reference when DA3 is released (although if you're already at your computer while playing the game, the wiki is faster reference).
B00881PTRC|4.0|but it does seem to me, so far, that I will be keeping it when I want a challenge, good graphic interface and concept it really cool!
B001D09OAI|5.0|What a classic.  Will always be one of the best sports comedies of all time.  If you haven't seen it, check it out!
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Game is a real challenge and you will spend some considerable time on this as well trying to solve some levels.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|kept up with expectations ..Was as good as anything he has written.<br />Well worth buying and would recommend it and have.
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|Didn't find it that much fun actually. I thought it would be more fun but I got bored after the first few levels, if you like this type of game maybe would will like it better.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|UPDATE IT PLEASE!!!!! Kindle users wanna visit winkie country and see Facebook friends!! It would keep the game interesting...for me anyway...hurry!!! (=
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I really love how it can twist and turn all ways.  That it leans in many positions also.  The one thing I don't like is that you can not recharge the Fire without leaving the case open.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it seems I'm always needing a calculator so this works great and the price was right! Definitely would recommend this.
B00A83075M|4.0|We absolutely loved this Disney movie. My son is a big video game fan so he had been waiting for this one to come out on dvd! It is a movie the whole family can enjoy! :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it doesn't matter which version you have, Angry Birds is always a great game. Even after I complete it, I go back and try to get 3 stars on all.
B0087IT8FK|2.0|but I have no idea why it is so highly rated.  Made a ton of money, and I'm happy for the filmmakers, but I don't get it, didn't seem like much of a story; will try watching it again to try to better understand why others found it so appealing
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It is a good movie!! basically more for adults than kids. Today &#34;kids&#34; movies are more for adults, Bad language and sexual overtone are everywhere!!
B005LAIIHG|2.0|I read the book when it came out, but don't remember it.  With the movie, as soon as I realized Pi's family died at sea, I lost interest - I didn't believe it at first and kept waiting for them to return.  Anyway, all the actors playing Pi were good, but for me, Pi as part of his entire wonderful family was the draw in the story, and as soon as I understood his family was lost, I became brokenhearted and emotionally left the film.  I was happy Pi survived, but Pi's mother and father were so interesting, had such different parenting strategies and outlooks on life, yet managed to give their son so much knowledge and wealth in love and care, that he survived nearly a year shipwrecked - their loss was too huge for me.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is a very engrossing game.  hours can slip away while<br />playing.  trying to beat the timer has left me frustrated at<br />time.  love it.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Well written, but last 15 minutes is majority of action. I liked it, left many things unanswered in the movie though.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting to play. What better way to pass the time then trying to spread a disease you can create around the world. The free version has different diseases you can unlock. Making sure you choose the right country to start from is very important in this game.
1611761182|5.0|This was a great sequel to Fall of Giants.  I loved listening to it on audio and can't wait til the third book arrives!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I was very disappointed with this movie, I think it showed all it's good parts in the trailer, yup one of those.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Brings back memories of when I first saw this movie! Such fine actors-great together! Recommend to anyone who has a romantic nature!
B00503BN1M|3.0|I love Natalie Portman, I always like her moves, unfortunately this one was not a hit for me. It's just very predictable and choosing Ashton as the main actor in my opinion was a mistake.
B00BF123WG|4.0|I like non fiction movies or at least movies based on real events. This captured her obsession with OBL really well. I enjoyed it and thought the rental was worth it.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I was hoping and expecting this to be much better.  The acting was ok, (too many familiar faces to make it believable...I love Tommy Lee Jones, but...it's 1865...) the costumes were excellent, though.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written, sad for me as I had just lost a 4 year old in a car accident. Well documented.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Great romantic comedy, left you wanting to see more with these 2 actors.  Definitely recommend for date night flick or girls night flix.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Good ap that fits the bill. I wouldn't buy it if they charged for it, but as a freebee it is OK.
B005544V6A|5.0|Fantastic series.  I women are lovely without being raunchy, the two lead play off each other very well.  I really, really like the scene in the apartment wherein the two got high and leveled with each other.  But still, the boss/lacky relationship was back in full swing the next morning.
B007EDYN36|5.0|You don't need to be a Peter fan. As most KISS fans are like me, they relate to one guy in the band. I was and am an Ace guy. I live in Sharon where Ace recorded his solo album. I used to watch him ride by on his moped when I was 9 years old, so He was my guy. I always liked Peter too, Not so much Gene and Paul. Now I am also a Peter guy. This book is full of chronological detail, but not to bore you. You won't want to put it down. It's also without any inhibitions, Peter tells it like it was, never clouds the story with ego or misinformation to make himself look good. He took a lot on the chin over the years and it's all here. It's not a Gene and Paul bashing...it is just the facts. I put this book away when I was done feeling good knowing Peter was now ok. He finally has the happiness he chased for years.<br /> I have read all the rockstar Autobiographies, and this one is top 3 for sure
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I thought this would be a challenging movie for me to watch, given the subject matter, but I wanted to see the acting and character development.  I'm so glad I watched this movie in that the acting and storyline held my attention throughout.  The predominant feeling I had as the movie ended was one of quiet gratitude that the actors had such courage in taking on their roles.  The movie was so real and filled with a kind of raw vulnerability and sweetness that is rarely seen on screen.  It was a touching movie to watch in all ways.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|It is unfortunate when a great story is ruined by someone changing it to tell their own version. That is basically what has happened in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit.<br /><br />While I understand the desire to weave extra material in to fill out the background of the story, the way it was done really ruined a charming story. This version takes the story and tries to force it into the mold of an action film rather than an adventure. Having listened to and unabridged audio version recently I can confirm there is plenty of action in the story, but not ridiculous things like riding on stone giants knees and getting smashed, or 15 fighting off a 100,000+ orcs while running across bridges and falling thousands of feet without hardly even a scratch. Of course I don't expect complete realism, but this is over the top.<br /><br />Then there is the grudge between Thorin and the orc and Radagast(who adds NOTHING to the story). Neither of these add substance to the story and I found them very annoying.<br /><br />Overall rather than being drawn in by the story I found myself wondering how many more unbelievable sequences they will do just for the 3d effect value and checking my watch to see how much was left.
B007V9N5R8|4.0|Works as advertised - its automatic mode yields reasonable results in my experience with four modern LCD displays of varying make and model.  Fairly consistent by default, between displays, though not entirely (in a way I can't pin down to any single attribute).  I did find that trying to configure the calibration parameters manually yielded very undesirable results (e.g. completely off colour balance), but I'm yet to prove that wasn't somehow user error.  Even if it is, though, it's a warning that outside of the default mode, it's not nearly as easy to get good results with.<br /><br />The only real notable annoyance is that it blinks.  Almost constantly.  You can of course unplug it, but then you lose the ambient light monitoring.  There's absolutely nothing in any of the documentation or on X-Rite's website about what the purpose of this blinking is, let alone how to turn it off, so I can't even determine if it's safe to tape over the lights, or if that'll mess up its calibrations.<br /><br />Subjectively, also, it profiles by default to D65 (~6,500K), which is a lot warmer than most modern LCDs' factory settings.  I got used to this - it's not &#34;wrong&#34;, but highly subjective and the reason I tried [but failed] to customise the calibration settings.  Something to keep in mind if you're a first-time user of a monitor calibration widget.<br /><br />I somewhat regret not getting the next model up, that can profile printers as well.  I also am a little disappointed that none of X-Rite's calibrators support iPhones or iPads yet, like their main competitor, the DataColor Spyders.
1434441636|4.0|I bought this book a couple of years ago and either gave it away or packed it away.  I wanted to particularly re=read the chapter on forgiveness, which I have found to be very informative and very helpful.  I recommend this book with no reservations.
1401924751|5.0|I love them.  I know I am always questioning whether I am on the right path or not, and this is just validation and guidance for my inner feelings.
B0025KVLSI|3.0|This album has some great moments on it.  \\"I'll Follow the Sun,\\" \\"No Reply\\" and \\"Eight Days a Week\\" are among the groups best; but the group sounds weary, especially in the covers.  This even has a genuinely bad song (all but unheard of for The Beatles) in \\"Mr. Moonlight.\\"
B000PMLFRA|4.0|The only three Star Wars movies as far as I'm concerned.  They WERE perfect. Then George Lucas screwed everything up with those horrible prequels.  But that wasn't enough.  He had to go and make Darth Vader scream &#34;Nooooooooooooo&#34; at the end.  The best scene in the series is now stupid.  Also, he replaced Anakin Skywalker with Maniquin Skywalker.  Why?  Anakin died as an old man.  Luke doesn't know who the young guy is.  But, still the original for the most part.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The Beatles, at this point, were more like four individual performers than a band.  It shows in this album with the length and the diverse selection of songs as though they couldn't decide what needed to be cut.  For any other band that would have been a problem, for The Beatles it's no issue at all.  Every song is brilliant, even their wildest experiments are flawless.<br /><br />They probably could have made an even stronger album if they had made some cuts and reworked some things, but why bother?  The album is amazing as is.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|It was good and could have possibly gotten 5 stars if it had not been near as long. I could have forgiven the fact that it was so long if the first 2 hours were near as good as the last hour.
B000056VJ7|5.0|If Bruce Springsteen had written a musical it probably would have sounded like this.  Overblown, adolescent and operatic, this album is classic rock in every sense.  Even so this album never goes too over the top.  Todd Rundgren's production keeps Jim Steinway's composition in line and Meat Loaf gives the songs, silly as they are, genuine heart.  It's no wonder this is one of the best selling albums of all time; a must own for anyone who is or ever was a teenager.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Very well priced thank you Kingston for your fair and balance prices.<br />Buy your Ram and other Electroinc needs from Kingston to support.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|All the news streams I read in one place. Freedly set my mornings free. Need more words to post this review. Short reviews would free my nights.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I don't watch tv that much, but I FINALLY decided to give this one a shot. So glad I did. I am hooked and can't wait to start watching season 2!
0440237688|5.0|Is completely amazing! Every time that I have read this book, I find something new to be amazed about. I still cannot wrap my head around this alternate universe, and how well put together it is. The author leaves the reader wondering how it truly ended, and depending on what kind of person you are is how you will decided if it was freedom that was reached  or death that consumed them.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|At first i couldn't get it to line up with my kindle but after a few tries it worked. This game is so addicting. I love it.
0439813786|5.0|is a fantastic read for a parent to read to their child or even for a child to read on their own. The illustrations are sporadically intertwined within the text; couple of pages of words and many pages of pictures! The drawings look like they have been sketched directly onto the pages and they are full of life and draws the reader into the story of Huge Cabert and his adventures. I had the hardest time putting it down and I found myself dreaming about running through the walls of this Paris train station! This is a wonderful read for any age and inspires us to follow our hearts and dreams.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Fun kid movie. Great for the whole family except for maybe really small kids who might believe in the boogey man.
B001BR5NN0|4.0|This worked out real good when my son needed to watch for a school project so I'm so glad I found out I can do this through Amazon
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a very safe game for our children to play<br />They enjoy the colors and soft music<br />They seem to get o on it everyday
B00973902K|5.0|Reminds me of the Olympics that were held last year in London. What else do you want me to say?!?
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|One of the best movies of the year and really brought back memories of a classier and righteous time. Plus the characters were completely believable!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I gave the second season of American Horror Story 5 big, shiny stars. I got tired of waiting for it to come out on Netflix, and the FX website only had episodes 9 or 10 and up. Although I rearlly should've purchased the HD version, I couldn't help but feel like I was somehow stealing from Amazon with what I actually paid for the season in SD.<br />If you were able to catch the first season American Horror Story, then you know it has nothing to do with the second. They are their own story lines, which in the end totally makes sense. The creators, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, have some seriously demented imaginations, and to be able to put their visions directly on-screen took some serious talent. The entire cast of this production has to be amazing because to pull off some of these scenes, you practically had to have lived in an Asylum during the 60s to get it so scary and accurately detailed. After extensive research, I found that most criminal asylums during this time period were much worse than this depiction, so those with a light heart, rest assure---we got off easy. Although the story line pushes the boundaries of fiction, It's displayed so well on-screen, you'd never know. This is not a show for the seriously religious types, as offense is easily taken to the amount of corruption within the Catholic Church, and behind the scenes. This show is best suited for those whom have the stomach for a dose of reality mixed with horror, add some dementia, spread on two psychos and toast lightly; an ingenuous sandwich of graphic horror and amazing script-writing and on-screen performance. If you have a solid gut, you won't want to wait till the fall for season 3 of this thriller. But you might benefit best from this purchase, because you'll want to rewind a few times and see these masterpieces again and again, over and over!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I luv this game and it so cool my own horse it like a dream come true me and my family luv it
1416955070|5.0|It was brand new and actually looked that way without any scratches or dents from shipment. I have received \\"brand new\\" damaged books from other sellers in the past, so I was happy and shocked to receive this book in perfect condition.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I am not addicted to this but I do find its fun and gives me a little break from my other games.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I like, not love, the &#34;Fast Diet&#34; ; it is pretty difficult and although it does work short term it would be quite difficult to sustain--the fasts<br />do not result in long-term weight loss as far as I was able to ascertain.<br /><br />I am glad I read it but would not recommend it as one of the more useful eating plans--<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Laurie Hubay<br />dhubay@cfl.rr.com
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I actually love playing this. My only complaints are I've had to upload it twice because somehow it disappears on me which stinks because then my high scores are gone. And sometimes the bubbles or balls seem to move in slow motion when I need them to go fast in arcade mode. Otherwise it's fun and challenging.
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Fast moving action flick--the actors hit the mark.  And Childs is an exceptiona author. Some what believable without all the tricks and gadgets seen here of late
B00030590I|1.0|I dislike this movie for the same reasons as the other Jet Li movie I am not impressed.Why was I required to buy it?
B009O2XY12|1.0|My error, I did not have a chance to view it.  I deleted it from my Android in error - still getting used to my tablet.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use the apt for local weather and alerts.Attached to my outdoor weather system. This is the only Apt that I use.<br /><br />There may be more, however I am not looking.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I enjoyed it, it can be very adictive!  I am not sure how to improve it.<br /><br />I would recommend it to others.
B0052REUW0|3.0|Dr. Pinker could have toned down his antireligion comments, especially when they were good but repeated too many times. I questioned his documentation when he used B.G. Walker as his support. I also found that the book could have been edited better and reduced in size. I struggled to reach the final pages because it was boring, repetitive, and dull.
B0050AV5MW|5.0|I just love these books, so much better to read it now that I have seen the series.<br />Love how the story has been put together.
B004UFEJS0|4.0|As a HUGE Disney fan, I'm ashamed to say I walked out of RATATOUILLE in the theatre. However, upon 2nd viewing years later, I have to say it is far more charming & clever than I remember. It's a refreshing  departure from the traditional Princess/Fairy Tale&#34; genre.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A little slow and self-indulgent at first, then the big whammy. The prose was more entertaining than rivetting for a thriller.  The bi-narrative was refreshing and kept the story rolling like a great swell that we hoped was pushing to a crashing break.  For me it never came, but I felt better for reading this book.  This deserves a sequel, firstly because the story demands it, and secondly, because I want more.
0486237664|4.0|I love this old book of animal illustrations and as an artist, I've used some of the images to help inspire me and understand the anatomy of various animals. I had the book a long time ago, lost it and repurchased it because I love it so much! The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the images aren't as sharp and clear as earlier editions of the book.
B00BF11STU|1.0|After trumpeting how Amazon has over 50,000 movies I can rent &#34;on demand&#34; it turns out that TiVo does not support its closed captioning, without which I can't understand the dialog since my hearing has deteriorated. Amazon was very good about refunding my rental money after I complained, so Amazon gets points for that. The movie did look as though it was good if only I could understand what the people were saying.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I love having this on my tablet. You can store favorites, so I can keep stacks of chord sheets handy without actually having to haul around stacks of chord sheets. Also, you can set it to scroll while you're playing. That's huge. I wish I'd found this thing months ago. Having a backlit, scrolling songbook is really handy is a lot of the situations I find myself playing in.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I'm a real Peter Jackson fan, so I liked &#34;The Hobbit&#34; a lot! The picture looked better on the large movie theater screen, but I bought the movie so that I could see it with closed captioning.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled upon this book and then could not put it down. Great suspense with great detail about a society that was very believable. Enjoy!!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Anyone working in academia is likely to know or be the hero of this book. Very relatable for a specific audience.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommmend it for anyone that enjoys a good book to read at night or in your spare time
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Nothing exceptional... it was OK.  It just drones on and on and really isn't that funny or has anything that strikes you.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|**Not sure why the 3D combo pack does not include a DVD as well as the Digital so I took 1 Star off for that.<br /><br />**Drawback... Disney usually uses iTunes for their Digital Copies (which the product information does not say)<br />I dislike iTunes digital movies for these reasons!...<br /><br />#1 Redeeming an iTunes Digital Copy takes forever!! Up to an hour and a half sometimes where as Redeeming UV UltraViolet(superior format) or CinemaNow Digital Copies takes under 1 minute!!!<br /><br />#2 Also, You cannot watch iTunes on your TV without buying an iTunes TV box. More money to spend. Where as UltraViolet UV has a TV app on most all blu ray players now that can be watched with merged free accounts with VUDU or CinemaNOw common apps on all Blu Ray Players. If you have a SmartTV the apps are already on your media Hub. Vudu is also on Roku Boxes but CinemaNow app is not on Roku Box yet.<br /><br />#3 These free Vudu & CinemaNow apps allow you to watch all your Digital  movies on any media device or phone in a cloud. I think its like 6 devices at a time can use the app and you can invite friends to merge their UV movies account with yours for sharing!  Also with these 2 apps you can also download your Digital Copies onto your devices at anytime to watch without WiFi connection for traveling. So iTunes Digital Copies are inferior because they are limited to where you can play them. Its very convenient to have my Digital movies on Vudu or CinemaNow so I don't always have to insert the hard BluRay or DVD disc into my player, I can just turn the player on and click on the app, select from all my digital movies then hit play to enjoy it without moving from my couch or bed!!!.... Check Best Buy or Target as they at times will offer a different Digital Copy format than iTunes for the same movie. I will always look for the UV UltraViolet or CinemaNow Digitals over iTunes!<br /><br />NOW  lets get to the movie as a production... I will keep it fairly short because it upsets me at how bad this movie was!<br /><br />Horrible acting across the board. James Franco bland, lifeless and no depth as well as the forced acting with all the witches! The storyline was all over the place, remedial dialog, pointless boring underdeveloped characters(that china doll?...sweet but pointless) poor pacing & a recycled score by Danny Elfman who I just love but no effort was put into an original sound for this epic flop.<br /><br />I was so excited for this movie but it was so boring and uninspiring. It was beautiful looking though with lots of color and beautiful set design but that was the only good quality of this movie in addition to the opening credits which were very cool but that is it. Opening credits and colorful set production don't make a movie good on their own. Disappointed all around. Bummer it could have been awesome!<br /><br />When leaving the theater I met someone that worked on the film who did the set design overseas and he told me that Johnny Depp was to play Oz but he backed out. Depp would have made all the difference for the character Oz but still the script is very weak.<br /><br />If you plan to buy this movie then get the 3D version. It will distract you a little from the horrible production as a whole. The only part I liked were a couple of the 3D effects but not sure how it will come off on a home 60\\" 3D tv.<br /><br />Overall the film was a horrible disappointment and a flop. I am looking forward to Warner Brothers reboot of the Wizard of Oz with Robert Zemeckis directing and a possible Robert Downey Jr. playing Oz. Since Warner Brothers has the original rights to the Wizard of Oz, they restricted Disney in many ways of duplicating anything from the original movie which is why so many viewers who loved the original Wizard of Oz were disappointed with OZ The Great & Powerful. Many restrictions from Warner Bro. were including the Witches shade of green, to her nose shape & wart along with all the other characters clothes etc... Even the ruby red slippers will not look the same in the Disney versions... I think Warner Brothers will destroy Disney with their Wizard of Oz remake by a long shot since they own the rights to the original and have the freedom to duplicate classic fan favorites from the film to having liberty to do whatever they want.... I feel Warner Brothers OZ will be superior!  But for now I am passing on buying this movie!

0061726834|4.0|Love, or as it is also more commonly known, Amor Deliria Nervosa: A disease one is to be cured of. The days of yearning and searching for true love are. Now, most are eager to be cured of even the remote chance to be infected with the disease, lest they suffer its symptoms. Said symptoms include the following: heart disease, anxiety, insomnia, stress and depression. Who knew love could be so...detrimental to one's health?<br /><br />Well, the self-proclaimed, \\"in-between\\" Magdalena Ella Holloway, AKA Lena knows this. She sees love as the disease the claimed her mother, leading her to suicide. She saw it is a sickness that ultimately leads to madness. In her eyes, the time for procedure to be performed couldn't come quickly enough. That is, until she meets Alex.<br /><br />The world of Delirium is one of few personal choices. Free will is all but extinct, and almost everyone is okay with the way life goes. The schools you attend are chosen for you, as well as your majors in college (should you be seen fit to attend). Even the person you get married, or paired with I should say, is decided for you.<br /><br />The Evaluation determines who you are suitable to paired with. Imagine that... Love and free will doesn't who you spend the rest of your life with, a group of people administering your test do. At least you get to \\"choose from who they choose for you.\\" Well, they take your preferences into consideration. Though, to see Lena question that system is extremely rewarding. Love may be considered a disease in her world, but witnessing Lena and Alex's relationship blossom is something I couldn't help but smile about. If falling in love is anything remotely close to what these two experience, I'll opt to be cure-free or diseased any day.<br /><br />Though their relationship, and the pacing of the novel, develop slowly, it develops nonetheless into something wonderful. It all changes with the simplest of things: a kiss. It brings forth feelings Lena never dreamt of experiencing and forever changes the way she views the life she's lived.<br />Lena is never the same once love takes hold of her heart; rest assured, you won't be the same after this book takes hold of yours.encing and forever changes the way she views the life she's lived.<br />Lena is never the same once love takes hold of her heart; rest assured, you won't be the same after this book takes hold of yours.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I really liked this book :)  It was the first book I have read by this author!  Great book and I would recommend it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  This is the first book that has been interesting enough for me to actually read all the way through and I loved it.  I would recommend this book be read by everyone.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I can't believe I never read this as a kid. I loved it. Couldn't put it down. I'd recommend it to anyone regardless of their age.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thought the first 1/2 of this book was incredibly tense, enthralling and I didn't want to put it down.  After that, it got a little boring and I just wanted it to be over so I could find out what happened.  I liked the author's style, though, and I'm on here now to order another of his novels.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What would the world be like if you had not been born? This movie addresses this question quite nicely and thought provokingly.
B0049H9NVW|4.0|In case you haven't noticed yet this is a cute game. However just because this is a cute game doesn't mean it isn't a fun game.<br /><br />I have only played through this game once with two other people so it took a while to play through that first game. While the instructions were a little tough to pick up at first but the third or fourth round we all pretty much knew what we were doing and things went pretty smoothly.<br /><br />The components of the game are well made and I feel like they are pretty durable as well as being aesthetically pleasing. One thing I did notice while playing through was that some of the bamboo pieces were harder to stack with each other while others had some wiggle room which made them much easier to stack and pull out. Also I felt like some of the weather patterns on the die were a little hard to see and I'm not really sure how lasting that paint will be. I do like that they include the mat with the the different weather effects and the different actions you can take but I found that we didn't really use the markers to mark which actions we did. I guess it would be helpful for younger kids.<br /><br />Overall this was a fun game and am glad I bought it.
B00BI745AA|2.0|Russell Crow's singing unfortunately brings the movie down a notch while I felt the music score lacked a level of consistency.
B00C7GY8Y4|5.0|It has been a while since I have played an new album every day and it is extremely rare that I am love with every track on the album. Jessie Ware's smooth vocals simple glide across the electronic/R&B beats. She has a unique way of delivering  a song with such subtle vocals but yet manages to come across so powerful.The overall feel of this album is quite chill. The gems of this album include Wildest Moments, Night Light, and Imagine It was Us.<br />If your a fan of Pop/Electronic/R&B this is  the perfect album for you.
B0098460O4|5.0|This album by these two makes my day, in the car, at home, on the patio. It will be a purchase you will love...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun game and could improve problem solving skills.  However, I think it has the ability to raise my blood pressure so I'm comtemplating deleting it or limiting the amount of tiime I play.  I guess I could recommend the game because it is interesting to play, but could be a real time waster.

B00BBW15R8|5.0|One of the best movies I've ever seen. Unlike so many French movies, which typically seem to be rather laborious, Intouchables is anything but. And when you realize it's based on a true story, it's even more enjoyable.

1451695195|1.0|I downloaded the free preview for this book  (the preview does not touch on the alleged NDE at all) and was drawn into what promised to be an interesting read.  However, I was disappointed.  I found the author's description of his \\"near death experience\\" to be unbelievable and some of his statements really set off my BS alarm.  I drew no comfort from this book and it did not ring true to me.  As a Christian, the only truth I know about spiritual matters and the afterlife comes from the Bible.  What was described in this book did not align with Biblical truths.  In fact, this author's experience was more along the lines of New Age religion, complete with psychics and mediatation into spiritual realms.  And call God \\"Om\\".  Um, no.<br /><br />Readers of this book who are interested in near death experiences should keep in mind that this guy never died.  His heart never stopped; he was simply in a coma for seven days or so.  Although the author tries to reason that he was brain dead, and he spends many pages spouting scientific blah blah to support this, I am more inclined to believe that his experience was simply the product of a very sick brain and nothing more. Personally I am much more swayed by accounts of NDE's from people who have actually died, especially those who were dead for quite some time before being revived.  There are many of those out there and those bear few (if any) similarities to this guy's account.  Thumbs down.  Don't waste your money.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I love these movies!  The cast is spectacular...I would watch them in anything.  This is a good if not a bit odd holiday movie.  Can't get any better than this.
B009ZUZ9FW|5.0|Some things never change. The K&R is still the only book a person needs to read in order to fully understand computer programming.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I thought this was a great book so much history that we did not know . Knowing the years from 1933 to 1949 it brought back many memories and made you sad for all that the people of England suffered but realizing how much the German people suffered also.. To realize what Hitler was doing , when all the country was following him must have been so hard for those who disagreed with his policies, and they were persecuted for their beliefs.<br />I liked this book as much as I did Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Most underrated Nolan movie, it is a lesson in crafty and engrossing screenplay. If you believe Jackman can be more than a wolf-man, this is the movie to watch. Caine and Bale are deightful. Might actually be my favorite Nolan movie since I have watched it 6 times already :)
B002B3W3TU|4.0|Been listening to this album/cd for a long time. Still find it a joy to listen to.  A good addition to any music library.
0671449028|5.0|We've got this and But Not the Hippopotamus and read both frequently to my nine-month old son. The text rhymes and is lengthy enough to keep his interest. I enjoy reading it; the story is really cute. But I'm with @Jeffrey E Kuhn, I'm not sure why the animals get all ready for bed and then go exercise. Wouldn't the exercise, THEN bathe and brush their teeth for bed? I'm sure it's just to have something that rhymes with &#34;And when the moon is on the rise..&#34; YOU try to finish that sentence with a bedtime-y type action. Maybe... they all begin to rub their eyes? Actually, that works. Nevermind. I have no idea why that's there other than to get their minds on being healthy. Who knows. It's a children's book. It doesn't have to make complete sense. Animals don't *usually* wear clothes or brush their teeth.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's a cute book and I enjoy reading it to my son. You will, too. To your child, not mine. You're not invited to bedtime. Haha.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Being an ACW History buff I tend to pick the eyes out of movies based on Historical people and events. And while I still had a lot to pick at in Lincoln I walked away satisfied that it was the closest yet to fact and gave a good insight into the man at the closing stages of the war, and his life.
0767836324|5.0|My husband LOVES this movie. Would watch it over and over when he was a kid. I, too, enjoyed it, especially the make-believe dinner scene. The story is about Peter Pan, all grown up, returning to Neverland as an adult. We used to watch it when it came on TV back in the day; we recently bought the DVD so we can watch it with our son when he's old enough.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is such a great series...the actors bring the characters alive and it's a fascinating look into life &#34;in service&#34; in the early 20th century in England!
0399226907|5.0|A must-have for any collection! Not only does this teach numbers, but it also teaches days of the week, the science of a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly... and the deeper lesson that we all begin life as one tiny little thing and end up as something totally different!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I think I was spoiled by the Hangover, because I really was expecting this to be a bit funnier.  All that I had heard was that it was super funny.  Didn't meet my expectations.<br />I did like to see Mark Wahlberg in a lighter type movie and the characters played well off each other.
0679809015|4.0|This board book is only 3 & 3/4 inches square. I thought I was ordering a larger board book. It's so tiny, I can barely hold it, my nine-month old AND flip the doors open on each page. If I had known it was this tiny, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. But I won't waste the energy returning it now that I've already got it in the house, AND my kid has chewed on one of the corners. :)<br /><br />Update: Nine months later, my son has \\"loved\\" this book so much we had to order a replacement. It's definitely the tiniest book in our whole house, but he keeps coming back to it!

0395389496|5.0|A friend of mine has 24 Christmas-themed books that she reads to her children each night in December, preparing their hearts for the Christmas season. I thought that was a great idea, so I began collecting books, too. This book, as well as How the Grinch Stole Christmas, were must-haves for my collection. I can hardly wait until Christmas so I can read this to my little one!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I did not want a Kindle...my husband kept trying to get me to read on his...but I like holding the book, turning pages, etc.  I finally grew weary of dragging so many things to church each week, so got it to have my Scriptures on it.  It was so much easier than dragging my large print scriptures everywhere!  Then I went to Italy.  I needed books for the flights, plus my scriptures for daily reading.  I loaded up my Kindle app, and finished the books on the flights that I had received for Christmas...had my daily scripture reading, and added little weight to my luggage and more importantly...took little space in my luggage!  Since my trip, I have continued reading at night in bed with my Kindle app and no longer have to worry about getting up to turn off the light.  The more I use it, the more I like it...and I recently learned that I can &#34;check out&#34; books from the public library, and am no longer limited to the large print section!  Also, my husband and I often like to read a book the other has purchased.  With large numbers, books can be &#34;loaned&#34; to the other.  Wonderful!

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|I was a HUGE fan of Cinderella back in the 80s-90s.  I always mention them as one of my favorite bands of all-time along with KISS, Aerosmith, AC/DC and Tesla.  One thing I always loved about most of those bands I mentioned where the abundance of blues in their music.  I was hoping for the next Cinderella album with this release and I did not get that.  However, I am not disappointed at all with this effort.  There are a couple of songs that would fit right in with the traditional Cinderella sound, but there are also some ventures into other styles on this album.  Some of it sounds a little country, some a little metal, some of it soft and some of it heavy, some of it rock and some of it blues;  but it is all great!  Now I just beg Mr. Keifer not to make us wait as long for his next release. :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend this series of books to any couple that is looking to expand their relationship.  Excellent book series
B0058SNLMS|5.0|Awesome !
B005HJU7HA|4.0|So far all the stories I've read are short.  They are interesting,but I do prefer the complexity of longer stories. I hope when I get to the part where he faces off with Moriarty, it will be more involved.  Go Sherlock!
B005D6O0LQ|5.0|Awesome !
B009EHDU7U|2.0|I became bored with this book half way through, despite the images that made me laugh.  Could have been made a lot shorter
B00BR0SEAK|5.0|If you're a fan of the current Deep Purple, you will absolutely love NOW What?!<br /><br />It may sound cliché but NOW What?! is a very strong album from start to finish, and no filler to be found. Believe me, there's too many highlights to mention. The sound quality is VERY good; especially in this day and age of the loudness wars. Singer Ian Gillan is sounding fantastic and his lyrics are top notch and quite thought provoking at times. There are things happening with this album that could only be achieved or accomplished when a band is completely in sync with each other. Being a full time working band has really paid off for Deep Purple this time around. A+ gentlemen!!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie and love the depth it brought to Bond and M.  Can't recommend this enough...so WATCH IT NOW. 'Nuff said.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Unbelievable insight! Ending seemed a little scattered, but I assume that was meant to be? Overall, I would recommend. Especially to someone going through this with a family member.

B0058VW36U|4.0|Addictive and really cute.  The kids like it too.  Worth the 99 cents.  Clean fun and challenging enough to entertain an adult.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Dianna Krall can't miss.  From Peel me a grape and Frim Fram Sauce, down to the live version of East of The Sun, West of the moon, taken from Live in paris, this is a great album for the car or a dinner party.  If you ever wanted to get into Jazz, buy this one and Miles Davies Kind of Blue.

B009JZWO3I|4.0|The show is wonderful and I am glad that i was able to purchase it on amazon immediately for viewing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series. It is suspense filled and tells the story of a young girl forced to survive. The three books are long enough to tell the story but short enough to make a good weekend read.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|This toy has been holding up for a couple weeks against 4 kids ages 2-8. The two buys especially have dropped this thing many times on the hardwood floor. They stay interested with it for 15-20 minute block, something I do not see often in any of their toys. The younger kids tend to use it as a ball but they have slowly picked up the idea after watching the older kids work through the puzzle. It seems like even after completing it, they still have a hard time doing it again, this helps with the replay value.<br /><br />This has been their favorite toy of the year and the fact that it helps with their problem solving and motor skills is a huge plus. It sounds like the customer service for the company is handled well based on other users problems so hopefully if anything comes up it will be an easy process to get it replaced.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|I just read this delightful new short story. The author creates the same sense of irony that he does in his novel. In 7,500 words, he has told a story that sums up the content of one man's life, an actor, and how he has come to a rather meager existence in his later years.<br /><br />It's a story of those who are lucky and those who aren't. The hero of the story wasn't, but he admired those who were, and never had an ill word to say about his fellow actors.<br /><br />The author has cleverly inserted references to his novel, which I thought was brilliant. Who would have thought of it?<br /><br />The story is concise and the main character well-developed. Again, it's a case of, what if I had done this, instead of that? An interesting concept.<br /><br />I would recommend this for an easy, yet profound, reading experience.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Very good story line.  The actual movie stoped and started several times.  I am not sure if it is my internet connection or the movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. THE GRAPHICS AND MUSIC ARE WONDERFUL. WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO PLAY. THE SLOTS COULD USE A LITTLE MORE HELP TO BE ABLE TO WIN EASIER, BUT OVERALL GREAT GAME.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie was pretty weird in it's own way but the storyline was pretty awesome and very enjoyable. Would definitely watch again.
B0030MTQNW|3.0|I was disappointed with this film.  B L Montgomery planned Operation Market Garden but was barely mentioned and not portrayed in the film,  He had great flair and was portrayed excellently in the film ,Patton.  The acting was good, especially by those playing German field marshals.  Too many scenes with music background only and a weak script.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Enjoyed this very much, very creative!  Fun for the whole family.......picture in HD is awesome, lots of details and vibrant colors.  I would watch this again.
B005544V6A|5.0|Welcome to the world of Harvey Spector and Mike Ross!! This is one of the best series I have ever watched!! Rachel Zain is so hot!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|While not all aspects of the book seem unique to it, it seems to take inspiration from some of the most popular novels of the sci-fi/fantasy genre without being rooted and constrained by Tolkienesque tropes.<br /><br />The author writes in a modern style, including most of the dialogue, which makes it easy and enjoyable to read. It can be off-putting, on occasion, when idiomatic phrases are used that (basing the time period on the general medieval feel) seem anachronistic.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Even better than season one!! this is a high powered great series in the minds of the greatest lawyers!! Purchase now, you will not regret it!!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is delightfully written. It grabs your interest right from the beginning to the very end. The plot is totally off the wall but you can't help waiting for the next twist and turn in the road. I laughed out loud several times. The translation from the original language is perhaps a little weak at times.  All in all, a great read
B004UO0SAO|3.0|Closest thing I could find to emulate my aging HP41CX, have a version on my iPhone 4s that has all the libraries on it. Maybe one day someone will make the app of the HP41CX!
B0007PALZ2|5.0|I love this movie. Brad Pitt at his best. makes you question if he really is insane. holds up over time.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I didn't think I would like it but it was thrilling and suspenseful.  I never read the book but this movie was good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well played and executed.  Gave a lot of information on historical events that should not be forgotten. It kept us glued to the screen through the entire movie.
B0095P31L6|4.0|My daughter loves this movie.  She has seen it more than once and it played great on the kindle fire.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was a good movie.  Very entertaining.  It was refreshing and different.  Good show for kids.  Thank you very much!
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I've been wanting to watch this movie for a while now and with Amazon prime I was able to watch it. It was a very cute movie I enjoyed it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|You can tell that the writer of this book is not a literary author. However, he doesn't claim to be. In pretty simple language he gets across to the reader how he came to be near death and his experiences in the afterlife. Some of the medical terms are as difficult to get through as they are to pronounce, but they only add to the story how rare it was for this incident to happen to Dr. Alexander. I wish he had included more of what his actual afterlife experiences were and the insights he got from them. It seems that he spent most of the book trying to convince his peers in the medical field that his experiences were real.<br />To me it all rang pretty true and made me want to look into what else has been written on afterlife experiences, so if that is what the author was trying for, he succeeded. If you are a sceptic, this is a good book to read.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really liked the book, and liked her other novel &#34;Sharp Objects,&#34; too. Interesting and unpredictable, but it will not leave you with a happy feeling, that's for sure. This was very dark and depressing...but a lot of fun to read!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Devoured it, I will read more by Strayed. I particularly enjoyed the raw honesty and genuine perspective on the struggles of life.
B005CKPQNE|3.0|Love the series on Netflix and couldn't wait till the next season showed up there so bought this episode. I believe the prices of this type of video, and movies, are too high.
1468179993|4.0|I bought this book for my Kindle as I knew I would be highlighting and marking up this book like crazy. I bought this book as I have begun to do more and more presentations and really enjoy delivering and talking with people who have interests and passions in the same field. I recognize that I have work to do when it comes to presenting.<br /><br />I read this book through two lens. One to help me as a presenter to help deliver more meaningful and important presentations. Two as a teacher to help enhance my delivery of learning in my classroom.<br /><br />I am not going to go into all the key takeaways from this book because I feel that you should really read it for yourself if interested. I have seen enough TED talks to be able to relate to most examples shared in the book so that helped, but if you have not seen many TED talks, then this book will take you a bit longer because you will want to see the videos as referenced in the book.<br /><br />Reading this book I really took away some key elements to improve my speaking and delivery. Very simple and practical tips and not ones that require more work on top of everything else.<br /><br />It is an easy read. Not very dense so if you are looking for high scholar type material this is not it. It digs deep enough to be powerful, but does not bore you to death.<br /><br />I have my Kindle notes printed and am beginning to analyze and reflect on my own teaching.<br /><br />Anyone who speaks or gives presentations should give this book a read to learn a few tricks to be even better.<br /><br />I would love to connect and talk about this book with others. My notes/highlights are open to the public on Kindle so check them all out along with all the other notes and  highlights.<br /><br />I look forward to using these tips in my next presentation to see if I can make some improvements.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|I have had this app for less than a month so, I am still not sure how accurate it is.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Actors played the parts! All in all a good season. Wouldn't change anything! This show is a nice way to relax.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is the essence of great TV.  It is wholesome and great for the family.  I would recommend this show to EVERYONE,  I even go my fiancé to start watching it, says its addicting and he the male TV watcher fighting/action type.
030758836X|3.0|Sounds thrilling, right? I thought so. Plus, with Flynn's track record, I figured Gone Girl was bound to top my list of best reads in 2013. Unfortunately, that isn't exactly what happened....<br /><br />Let's start with the good.... Ultimately, I did like the book. I may not have been totally blown away, but it was intense and interesting. I enjoy Flynn's writing... it is gritty and real. She is a strong writer and I think she does a good job developing character. Particularly in Amy- she did quite the job creating character for her. Those of you that have read it, you know what I'm saying here. Nick didn't have nearly as much depth as Amy, but I think Flynn still did a good job with him. Flynn did a fabulous job portraying both of them and altering them throughout the story which in turn allowed the reader to have many mixed feelings and pass judgement.<br /><br />So here is what troubled me... Gone Girl was really hard to get into. I was not very interested and it did not hold my attention. Quite frankly, I was bored. The diary entries by Amy were dull and annoyed me (especially in the beginning). It was a good 100 pages before I was hooked, which in my opinion is MUCH too long. The other thing that bugged me was the flow- it was occasionally quite choppy, the way it swapped between narrators. Oh, and the ending. I HATED the ending... as in, chuck the book down and curse.<br /><br />Overall, I ended up liking the book as a whole... it just took some time to get there. It was interesting and had a very Flynn twist to it. Even though I was super pissed off (no, really- I was angry about it) at the ending, I enjoyed the story as a whole.<br />Gone Girl is not a book I would recommend rushing out and buying... if you are interested, borrow from the library or a friend. You may like this book if you don't mind a slower paced beginning and plot framing. Those who enjoy a good mystery and a lot of twists would also likely enjoy this. Once you get into the meat of the novel, it does deliver.el, it does deliver.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am NOT first of all a big fan of TV.  I have never been a big fan of old or foreign screen TV or movies.  I traditionally would watch Crime TV and that was about it.  I even got rid of my cable because of my lack of quality programming.<br /><br />I kept seeing this show advertised and read the great reviews and still could not bring myself to watch it....until one day....I decided to give it a try.  THIS SHOW IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SHOW ALMOST THAT  I HAVE EVER WATCHED.  Even though I can not even think of one that comes close.  I even broke down and bought the Season 3 on Amazon,  and I have never EVER purchased a movie or show in my life on TV.  I hope this show never goes away.  I have now become a fan of British TV and film, actually a BIG fan.  Keep the great TV coming Amazon!!!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a powerful book.  I have a completely different outlook on mental illness, family compassion and acceptance.  Thank you Lisa Genova.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Here I am again reviewing another great British show.  The great thing about it is, I have not even touched the tip of the iceberg.  I thought this show was wonderful, what more can I say!!!!!
1416914285|5.0|This was such an excellent book. I was concerned that the subject of siblings being in love but it was so clever how things turned out.  Thank you so very much.  Denise
B004NS710C|5.0|This was just as exciting as the first time I saw it.  The suspense never stops.  The acting is good.  If you like a movie filled with suspenseful action, this is it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I thought it was going to be where it was going to be youtube but its not.do not get this app.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This was the most exiting book I've read!!!I hope I get more!I'm going to read this awesome book again Tommorow!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Borrowed this novel in paperback and loved it so much that I purchased it on my Kindle for my husband to read. It was soulfull,laugh out loud funny and heartwrenching all at the same time.  It brought tears to my eyes as well as a smile to my face.  If you are an animal lover, this is a must read.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|When I first heard \\"Solid Ground\\" earlier this year, I knew we were in for a treat. This opening track reminds me a little bit of my favorite Cinderella song, \\"Bad Seamstress Blues.\\" This album is not a rocker from start to finish the way Night Songs or Long Cold Winter are, but that is what makes this album brilliant. Tom tackles multiple styles and genres here, but they all feel natural and work very well. His unique voice has always been one of my favorites in rock and roll, and the diversity featured on this album helps to highlight all he can really do. Many of the songs have that signature Tom Keifer blues tinge, which is something that always set the Cinderella catalog apart from the Hair Metal genre for me. No matter where he goes musically, you are never too far from the comforting twang of slide guitar. I recommend this album not only to Cinderella fans ready for something more, but to anyone who wants to experience a musical journey. The Way Life Goes plays as a fluid, powerful album and is one of the best albums I have ever heard in terms of great songs from track 1 to track 14.
034580404X|3.0|I was so excited to receive these books and could not wait to get started reading them. To my utter amazement, I was tremendously disappointed. Gave them to my daughter. Maybe she will think them better written. Nothing to do with the content, just very boring.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|The story, the script, the high level acting, the directing, the quality of the overall film was awesome. Every moment/scene in the movie intelligently connects with another somewhere else in the story. Brilliantly done!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It was good. I liked to read it. I learned a lot. I won't read it again unless I do.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a great alarm for just about anything Loud but not irritating enough to wake whole family very consistant thanx
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is great book with inspiring details. Great read and it is just a great book! Read it every day
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book. I was captured with the first chapter and after that I could not put the book down. The love story was captivating and really left me wanting more.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Very good album, just about every song I like.  New sound for a few songs but it still sounds great
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was very hard to put down. The story flowed nicely and Mr. Grisham kept me guessing until the very end.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|After you get the hang of it and figure out what is where it is a great way to pass the time. I thought the mini games were equally entertaining as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game provides me a &quot;mental break&quot; when I play it at the same time it is helping me increase my visual perspective and stimulate brain function. My son loves playing too and he is only 6! He is enhancing his problem solving skills while playing.
B008NMT684|5.0|I had to buy them all. The animal, car and train puzzles. These are lifesavers, keeps my son busy during doctors appointments, long car ride, dinner out.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|It was a good book. Kept me pulled in and wanting to keep reading until the very end. Very descriptive and imaginative.
0761158820|5.0|This teaches great spacial skills, fine motor skills and once made the monsters are great creative toys. We love amount of time these monsters keep our kids busy.
B00B2G2RG6|1.0|Good acting, good tension, good scenery, ... but the FBI seem to make a mistake at every turn and the cult members always seem to be in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />I won't watch season 2.
B0091THRCU|4.0|Very snug but pull out band works great.  Would give 5 stars if pocket for cards was slightly less snug.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book ended leaving me with a lot of questions. For example  at the end<br />, where was her mother; why was Haymitch really there; what happened to Gale? It was still an interesting story, although I didn't think it was as tightly woven as the other two books were.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game is very calm and fun. I have only just begun to get into it, but so far so good. Nothing too exciting and the goals are easily reachable. I would refer this game to all ages as a good game to pass time with. If you are looking for a thrill... this is not were to look...have fun!
B004TI5N38|5.0|As soon as I was done with this book I went onto his next John Puller book which was just as good if not better!
0553801473|5.0|Before reading AFFC, I decided to read some of the reviews. For the most part, they were all negative. Because of that, I had it in mind that I was going to dislike the book as well. I was a fool to let reviews ruin a good book for me. I did not make the same mistake for ADWD. Only after finishing the book that I decided to read some of the reviews. Some are really negative, which could have really ruin the book for me. My advice to you is to not read any more reviews. Read the book, and then make your opinion. I re-read AFFC because I knew I had miss some detail the first time.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|I was surprised at how well this holds up.  It is rather amazing to realize that everything you've seen in action movies for the last 15 years comes from this.  Definitely worth revisiting.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Didn't have enough computer savy to download.  What else can I say.  Didn/t use it.  That is all I have to say.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|this amazing documentary and cd are outstanding!  I have literally watched the movie over 15 times!  This is a must see for music lovers!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It did have some realistic things about the way people are already living.  no respect for human life but it was very gruesome and the idea of killing young  people and people watching on tv was very disturbing to me.  I can't understand why the young people are so engrossed with these books.  I had to read for my book club and I am going to read the next book just to see what young people are reading today.  I hope that they can see just how horrible this is and not let our world come to this.
B000002KIE|5.0|The seminal beginning of punk rock all wrapped up in a single CD.  This is Sex Pistols only true studio recording as The Great Rock and Roll Swindle was never really finished.  It is hard to believe what this single album stands for and how it changed not only music but the whole social system of the time.  If nothing else this CD is a chunk of history that I am sure anthropologists do and will study for all time.  Thank you Sex Pistols for changing mine and many others lives!
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|My wife and I went to see Ringo & His All Starr band in concert last year. What a concert it was! Not only did we get to see Ringo perform some of his greatest hits, we also saw a bit of rock history with the assortment of fine musicians who brought their own songs from the past with them. It was like we put a few bucks in a really good juke box and just hit play! This DVD captured the whole thing and we can't get enough of it. Its great to see all of these guys still playing great music, together! We plan to see every All Starr tour that Ringo puts together.
B001NB545Q|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums of all time.  The song Behind Blue Eyes one of my favorite songs of all time.  I still own my original vinyl recording from 1971 and thought I would add the CD.  Although the CD doesn't have quite the depth, warmth and oomph that the vinyl has it is still a very good recording and I am hearing certain sounds I don't in the original vinyl.
B00BQHA06A|4.0|I really enjoy this new album. I put it on par with Dark Light & Venus Doom. It's no Razorblade Romance or Love Metal, but after the very disappointing pop sounding Screamworks, it's nice to have the heavier sound back. I am a huge fan of this band, but I just can't get into Screamworks.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Not only is this a great case for transport but also a second battery. Thanks for sending it so quickly!
B0006L0LOS|5.0|PUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT  movie!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love cats and the mystierious. This movie is something I wanted to own for a long time.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I tried to open this on my kindle but it wouldn't open. My friend is having the same problem. They need to fix the app.
0425263908|4.0|This is a good book, but not as good as 50 shades of grey. I received the book on time and the condition of the book was good except for a small tear on the front cover. Damage could have been from shipping. Didn't effect the reading of the book.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|couldn't figure it out - deleted it<br />the clock was small and I honestly could not firue out how to set the clock or the alarm
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Love the trilogy although book three was a little slow it picked up n was a great fairytale ending..highly recommended!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book has been a great eye opener. Keep writing because you will help many women like myself feeling as though we do not need to apologize for our talents!
0385536828|5.0|While some readers may be quick to draw the \\"Tinker, tailor...\\", comparison, I resisted the temptation and felt that a richer more heavily nuanced story was unfolding. Personally, the spying bit gets a little comical at times and complete farce towards the end. Serena's character is easy to relate to. The novel pretty much opens with golden romance then bittersweet heartbreak that never completely wanes. Ever the optimist Serena begins work at MI5, and the ponies are off! Max as fellow spy and upper management plays the usual unwanted jealous headgames with her throughout the book. Once Tom Hadley enters the picture, the sadness of Tony Canning begins to recede. This Tom Hadley is such a hilarious unexpected character. In a tiny way, McEwan seems to be hinting the reader about the end. Tom's short stories are amazing. One can easily lose themselves inside Tom's imagination. His novel, who's kidding who here, is literally, Cormac McCarthy's, The Road. I took this as a tribute to McCarthy and found it quite clever. Both Kingsley and Martin Amis are mentioned, Martin's \\"cameo\\", super funny. The twist at the end was a surprise, and I usually guess the ending accurately. I'm so happy I was wrong. That is the most I'll give away. A lovely novel in any light.
B00005KARK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter. She wanted to watch it every time she came to our house. We have it on VHS, and I needed a copy on DVD as my daughter does not have a VHS player!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is excellent viewing. When I finish viewing each episode, I can't wait to start the next. Purchasing the complete season to watch it on Amazon Prime TV is more economical and is very convenient.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I consider this a classic because every time i play it i enjoy it. Marilyn Mason at his best.<br />i recommend this album to anyone that likes metal.<br /> if you are a fan of that metal sound this album should be in your collection.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but thought that a lot was left up to the viewer to fill in from reading the book. Scene transitions were a little rough. Otherwise, a pretty entertaining and thought provoking show.
B00000AFGM|5.0|i liked every song, it goes from hard loud rock to slower calm back to fun alternative metal. is really a great album. recommend it to anyone that likes rock
B00BHMF578|5.0|The movie was a surprise to me.  As an adult during this crisis it brought back feelings of the times.  I recommend this movie to all.  It is inspiring.
B00005U2JL|5.0|this is better than the live at LA copy because it's a compilation of all the shows.<br />recommend to anyone that likes rock and good show. die hard fans of manson should own this too.
B00186DV1U|5.0|Individual plot summaries of these movies can be found everywhere as well as opinions on the plots, acting and actors so I will focus only on the quality of the transfer of this movie to Blu Ray.<br /><br />In the Line of Fire was shot some time ago but still has legs as an intriguing and suspenseful film.  This Blu Ray came only with the one Blu Ray disc.<br /><br />The video transfer is really quite clean with good details in the dark and shadow areas.  At no point did I see any artifacts or dirt and, except in one of the deleted scenes, no stair stepping or color banding anywhere.  The Mbps rate appeared to average in the mid twenties.  Colors were natural looking and the focus of the transfer to blu ray is generally soft and film like without the video type color popping that we often see on some of today's films.  Since I do not have the Standard Def version I really can't make a comparison between the formats but the Blu Ray transfer offers good contrast and clean imaging.<br /><br />The audio transfer comes as a lossless Dolby True HD 5.1 and was surprisingly very good.  I did not expect much for the audio as the film is more dialogue driven than action but there were many opportunities for the audio editors to steer discreet foley fx to all channels.  Pans from front to back and back to front were there when appropriate and you get a very nice, clean and transparent sound for both the front and rear sound stages.  Good separation between the front, center and sides for the music track and proper audio leveling all around.<br /><br />My big beef with this and many Blu Rays are the multiple preview ads for other films. These ads take up space on the disc that could go to less compression and thus a higher quality audio and video transfer.<br /><br />Several extras on the disc included  different languages, some unfinished in post production deleted scenes, none of which were terribly essential or worthy of an extended version, commentary and a couple of short docs on the making of the film.<br /><br />All in all, a very worthy film to add to your Blu Ray collection.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.docs on the making of the film.<br /><br />All in all, a very worthy film to add to your Blu Ray collection.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.
B008Q07U5O|5.0|I've seen Chinatown numerous times and it never gets old. I always find something new. I would say its better than The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep but those are from different eras and I think the comparison is unfair. Great story great twist. You'll thank me later.
0470901071|5.0|This is a great book for all the networking test information but is not for the beginner in no way but its laid out in great detail and seems to cover all that is needed
B0033AGPFS|5.0|I have listened to this record for decades now but it has always been on cassette or CD or MP3. My unbelievably awesome wife just got this for me on vinyl and there is so much more depth here. It is like the difference between a hot house tomato and one fresh from the garden. Sure they are both tasty but one has so many more subtle joys to offer than the other.<br /><br />Don't believe the lies, there is a difference! MP3's are ok, CDs are better but for the love of all that is beautiful in the world listen to this on vinyl at least one time in your life!
B0095P29EG|4.0|I like this movie. It has action, some humor, and a bit of a &#34;feel good&#34; nature. However, the film feels like it still needs some refinement; particularly in its plot.<br /><br />[Not sure if this counts as SPOILERS, but be warned nonetheless] While the pacing is good, once you're done, it feels as though the movie progressed to quickly through its content. This is probably because the film's plot centers around Thor needing to learn a lesson. Once he finally changes for the better, he quickly saves the world and everyone goes home happy. Then the movie ends.<br /><br />The film spends about 90% of its time with Thor &#34;becoming a better man&#34; and about 10% on him as an actual hero. Once I finally get to appreciate this character, the movie ends. It's a feeling that seriously left me wanting more.<br /><br />But as I said before, it's a thoroughly enjoyable film. His progression from arrogant, spoiled royalty to honorable hero, is entertaining. It provides much of the &#34;feel good&#34; of the film. I just wish that there was more &#34;hero&#34; in it as well.<br /><br />Perhaps a mini-series would have been a better format for Thor.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Got very boring after a while.  Need more to do, rather than just selecting combinations and trying to remember what I had done before.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is so catchy I cannot stop listening too it. I'm up all night to get lucky!! get lucky
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I highlighted so many passages because of the simplicity and poetry they represented. Great book club book. I can't wait to discuss it with my friends.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|This is a great series of games, however I would not recommend it for kids. Not because anything is inappropriate, simply because it is not a violent, shooter type game. The story revolves around our main character literally making a journey. It appears to be a journey of enlightenment. You do not have limited lives, so you really never die, you just journey. My only complaint about this game is it is too short. I am an average game player and I finished it in about two hours.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Always loved Stevie Wonder and hadn't  picked up any new music for a long time. Finally got rid of all the old cassettes and ordered some of my old stuff on cd. WOW  Just as good as i remembered.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  I was kept interested the entire book, which is pretty unusual for me.  Only reason I did not give 5 Stars is bc I was slightly disappointed in the ending....
B004I4H8QS|5.0|Great stuff. Brings back the 70's and allot of great memories. This is still a favorite of mine. I'll buy more.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|After watching the movie, I wanted the sound track!  Though not an Oscar winner, the movie was fun to watch and music nostalgic!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once I picked up this book I did not put it down until I was done.  Simple story about people who are broken and find a way to put themselves back together again.
1439156816|3.0|I was a bit disappointed, because I really believed that we would forego the preaching aspect. Interest through the memoir lasted about sixty pages. Then it went into grammar, but they are the same old grammar arguments you find everywhere on the internet. Mind your manners and buy a Strunk and White.<br /><br />I expected more.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Cheap entertainment, first 5ish worlds are easy compred to original DS version. Entertaining none the less. I recommend this game to anyone that has an extra .99$ laying about.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Beautiful graphics. Directions that are for the most part straightforward. Game moves fast enough with small tasks to make free game play fun.
0345803485|3.0|I've read better. The only thing I really cared for was the dialogue. It's just not very well written as far as plot and structure.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|A good way to find old friends and new friends.  Keeping up to date with the world.  and playing games
B0024SQW2Q|3.0|Movie was a good prequil to the series. Very dramatic. Could have used something.... maybe a little humor. Love the actor that plays the dad vampire. He is amazing as davy jones in pirates of the carribbean dead man's chest. Could listen to him all day.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very helpful app with amazing display, and is very useful, tells how much time remaining for music, video, web,5 stars!!!
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|The Following was a program that I could not miss watching after seeing the first episode.  Each week continued the suspense that made watching the next episode a &#34;must&#34;.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I LOVED the whole book, but the ending was amazing. It's not often I read a book worthy of 5 stars. This book is absolutely worthy.
B000H0MKO2|5.0|The hero of  this  movie is  responsible for more  deaths than booze, guns  ...the voice of big tobacco. Yet by  the  end, your pulling  for him. How is  this possible?  Good casting,  better  acting  and  an even better  script. 5 stars is not  enough!<br />Alan from Az.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I was really taken in by Beautiful Creatures and had high hopes for the next in the series. As the title implies this book is very dark and I must say I am not sure I like Lena anymore.  Hope the series picks up from here.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great film. Almost accurate, only two segments that did not happen in real like but that is O.K., it did add to the film as long as you know the real story. A true but very sad story.
B005C8ENI0|2.0|Was hoping for something other than a Grisham type knock off. Predictable and poor acting by the lead actor McConaughy.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|This app is easy to use on my new android tablet!  Amazon is the place to go for easy to use apps...Fantastic!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book was hopeless and it was a stupid pick on my behalf and I will never read Colleen Hoover again
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I recomend is a very good cd and only a week I had in my house, thanks so much for all
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game, it is so cute and entertaining. It reminds me a lot of tiny monsters. You start by growing algae and then homes for fish. Characters even show up eventually, after playing the game for so long you get to see Dory and many of the other adorable fish from the movie.  The one thing that I don't really like is the time it takes to build certain things. At level 3 I was having to wait 3 and a half hours &times; 3 for each growth... You feed the plants algae 3 times to get it to the point where you can collect money or more algae. The amount of algae is pretty ridiculous though. 400 to feed a fish at level 10 that finishes a quest which you must complete to get new stuff; otherwise its awesome. 5 stars even with the things I don't like
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great show! Plenty of romance and drama to keep you interested!<br /><br />Favorite part was that it was free on my Prime membership
B0095P31L6|1.0|A very dark cartoon not appropriate for children.  The adults watching it didn't like it either!  Would not recommend for anyone looking to be entertained.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Very cute movie. Johnny Depp is good. I like how it uses sayings from characters in the past. Must see.
B00BBRPRDG|3.0|This is a good CD for Poco fans, but the band misses Paul and his great talent.  I would think that since it is the first CD without Paul it would take at least another CD for them to get the hang of it.  If by some small miracle he is invited back to the band they would go to the top of the Poco mountain because having the new member, Michael, adding his talent to the band along with the other members it would be awesome.  They are touring and are definitely worth seeing.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This is an awesome series.  This was a prequel and this movie is so exciting.  The character Gannicus is amazing!  I would rate this movie a perfect 10.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The impact on society by such books is obvious.  The female writer has betrayed herself and all women.  But the topic is the one that sells and will make her a lot of money.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Awesome Series!  I was able to look forward to Friday's.  Excellent Movie!!!  This is a must see!  Liam McIntyre did a great job on replacing Andy Whitfield.  I will miss that guy!
B008Y7EYSK|5.0|Loved the movie!  I love movies involving the supernatural....this was a great movie.  Full of surprises and scares around every corner.  Wonderfully done.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I just didn't really know what to expect with this story.  It was recommended to me and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />This book was so well written you feel fully immersed in the characters.<br /><br />This author reminded me of Wally Lamb!  I will be looking for more from John Green.
B00683JLXA|5.0|My son loves this one! He was playing it was some new friends he met at a wedding this weekend! It seems to be pretty popular with the kids!!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|My husband and I watched Michael Mosley's Horizon program on PBS one night and were completely inspired. I've been pescarian (no meat, just fish) for over a decade. My cholesterol is still sky high and I'm on the high end of the BMI scale. My husband is much the same and suffered a heart attack in his early 50s (we are in our late 50s). Mosley and co-author, Mimi Spencer, write clearly - not a lot of technical/medical jargon - and convincingly. The first fast day was a breeze. The 2nd not so easy! Going into our 4th week, it's come to be just something we do while not wholly looking forward to it. We stay very busy on fast days and go to bed early! It's undoubtedly easier when you can do it with a partner. I bought the book on Kindle but I would recommend a hard copy - easier to flip through pages for calorie counting and and the recipes. Although, I would have preferred a better calorie counter and could do without the personal testimonials. It's not a strict fast in that women can have 500 calories on a fast day, men get 600. There are 10 days (a month) of recipes for 500 calorie days, 10 for 600 calories. and are actually quite good. You will need to invest in a kitchen scale. I'm a little disappointed in that I don't see the drop in weight and inches that I was hoping for (just a couple of pounds) but I'm determined to stick to this for 6 months and check the results. Both of us could stand to drop a good 10 lbs but are doing this more for the improvements in health. I've never been on a diet of any kind, but I hope for this to be a change in lifestyle. It has made me more aware of serving proportions and calories on off days. I have insomnia but sleep great on fast days.
0786891416|4.0|I love the television show, Castle, and it was marketing genius to have \\"Castle\\" publish the very books he claims to have written in the series. Outside of the blatant public relations gimmick, I actually found the novel quite enjoyable and am looking forward to reading the others. While many have mentioned that the books are just like a Castle episode, I have no problem with that, and in fact, totally enjoyed that it was. Quite the enjoyable read, fun, and smartly written. I have my suspicions \\"who\\" Richard Castle is, but it doesn't take away from the enjoyable story. I hope we get to see a few more of these before the public tires of Caskett. In the meantime, I'll be reading another soon.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was definitely a well made drama Christian movie with good acting. We enjoyed watching it. It was new. It came on time.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|radioactive is the only song on here that really stands out, that being said the rest of the cd is worth listening to.
B005NPCBI6|5.0|Awesome every time. It's like the first time I heard it in school every time I listen to it. Remix is great.
1451695195|3.0|If you are interested in personal accounts of what is on the other side of death, this book gives you a front seat.  I appreciate Dr. Alexander's willingness to share his experience. This book gives hope that we will see our loved ones when our earthly sojourn is done. I believe that we have yet to discover many scientific truths that may explain NDEs.  I respect personal accounts of NDEs, medical miracles and other phenomena we can't understand.  That being said, I am left with unanswered questions regarding this book. He said his brain was destroyed by an E. Coli meningitis infection. On day 7 he wakes up, can speak and has a return to cognitive function. I need more clarity with his interpretation of how this transpired. I hope that further writing by Dr. Alexander will offer more clarity and be more tightly edited.
B003VPWX6K|5.0|A lovely tale narrated by a professional British butler. His thoughts about his life and career illuminate an institution that Americans rarely experience.The window of the protagonists's perspective is illustrated brilliantly as the story unfolds.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It started to seem like a lot of repetition.  Katniss was acting more like a petualant teenager in this book.  Send her to her room!
0439023521|4.0|I definitely enjoyed reading this book and was anxious to get back to it every time I had to put it down.  The story was action-packed and the author's creativity is impressive.  I loved the character of Katniss- her concern for others, her bravery, her cleverness.  I loved all the plot twists in the Arena, it really was unpredictable and suspenseful.<br /><br />One criticism I could make is that some of the interior monologue is weak.  For example, when Katniss is drawn to the tribute who reminds her of her sister- Collins doesn't let us figure that out ourselves: she spells it out for us. \\"Prim, I mean Rue...\\"  Of course, this book was published by Scholastic and intended for a young audience, so maybe this very dumbed-down symbolism is necessary.<br /><br />As many have noted, it really is very violent/dark/disturbing.  I don't know if I would want my children reading this book or seeing the movie.  While it is intended to teach a valuable lesson , I think it would be a lot for a kid to handle.  I think it would have given me quite a few nightmares when I was 12.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the other two!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you read the other books, you'll enjoy reading this one.  George doesn't disappoint with this return to Westeros and the lands beyond.
B0060CV31C|4.0|Good for several laughs.  Just plain fun.  An enjoyable movie with a little moral.  Even my hubby laughed out loud.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this kind of game where you use hour mind more than fast fingers to advance from one level to the next. Great job guys! I will be excited to see the next rooms in the house.
B009NTNHJU|3.0|THE CD IS OK. I should have just bought the songs I wanted from amazon.. I love Nicki but the CD is ok..
B004G5ZY7E|3.0|not his greatest but it was ok to pass the time for the few hours it took to read it.
B000JML7YC|4.0|This books apealed to the romantic side of girls, so its always nice to have the main character win the battles and be happy at last.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|Great movie just like the first 2. This movie is a tear jerker!!!!! I hope when I have kids they treasure that one toy like Andy did to his :D definetly a must watch!!!
B002RKSZN0|4.0|I like this one because its very real many people when in love are blindsided and ignore the things they dislike of that person, fortunately to this guy, he realize how empty the girl was before any serious commitment. Then the girl who always loved him got the chance to be happy by his side.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Once Upon a Time is very imaginative and I download the videos weekly to my video library on Amazon.  As I have said, I love fairy tales.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Diana Krall's \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" is the type of album that captures your heart if you let it.  I've listened to the songs and also seen her live on tour. Understand that Diana is a fan and student of music history, yet while she appreciates the writers and musicians that crafted the songs her take is always unique and always Diana. I don't think any mere mortal really has the right to judge or review someone like Diana Krall but I'm so disappointed in many of the reviews.  During her concert Diana talks about her fondness for the women who went before her, opening opportunities. The women of Vaudeville who are the \\"Glad Rag Dolls\\" of the album's title.<br /><br />This album is worth it for any 2 or 3 of these songs alone:<br />Wide River to Cross - My favorite song on the album<br />Just Like a Butterfly in the Rain - The most tender song and so beautifully and softly sung by Diana at the top of her game<br />Let it Rain -<br />We Just Couldn't Say Gooddbye<br />or Prairie Lullaby - our new favorite bedtime song for our children<br /><br />Any lady a little ticked a man will revel in \\"Not Worth the Salt of my Tears\\"<br /><br />When Diana sings \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" imagine the life of an entertainer in the 1920's, it was obvious Diana is. Come back to Omaha Diana, we love you!<br /><br />Do we want artists? Artists who take chances, play instruments and put their own take on songs? I do and I think Diana rewarded all of us that love her. If you can, see her live. I defy any of the less 5 star reviewers to see her current tour and not eat their words.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Quite an epoch game. I hate myself a little for the pun, but moving on. I would like to see a Victorian age level pack soon!
B0041VT6HW|2.0|It started off OK but it just felt a little bit forced through a lot of the movie.  It still had some good parts but overall, I was disappointed.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|In brief words - a classical Tarrantino movie: an ok story, good actors, great performances by the actors (see Christoph Waltz) and slightly too bloody - and Quentin turns more and more into Hitchcock with his brief appearances in his own movies.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love it and play it every night before going to bed MY granbabies enjoy it too. And one of my co-worker
B0089J270U|5.0|Anyone who loves Broadway or Hollywood musicals will truly appreciate what Bluray has accomplished with this film.  It has brought it to a sparkle and excitement that is missing in the original formats.  With new films I was not able to appreciate Bluray since most new films in HD look terrific.  Also, if you have never seen this film - be ready for several surprises..Donald O'Connor has never been mentioned as a great dancer  compared with Fred and Gene.  I always thought he was terrific and just as good.  I thinkk you will enjoy again or for the first time.  OK, it is a bit corny but still great.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|01-05-13<br /><br />The book was a typical Jeffrey Archer, which I like. I know that there will be a continuation, but the ending of this part was lously -- maybe that was because It was my first purchase and it didn't download properly. I intend to go to a bookshop and check a printed version, but if it's the same as my downloaded version, then I think Mr Archer is getting lazy. He's treating his customers with no respect.<br />I hope I'm wrong !!<br />I only gave it three stars because of the ending.<br />Regards,<br />Colm Bennett.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|We laughed all the way through this move, at times until tears.  The humor is outlandish at times, almost uncomfortable (not quite Borat, but in that vein).  I think you might have to be in your middle age in the 2010's to get it all, but perhaps not.  We kept talking about it the next day and laughing all over again.  HILARIOUS!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I play this game a lot also. It it is fun and challenging. The only bad thing is that you lose time like that(snap fingers).
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|The depth of emotion in this book is great.  It is a lovely look into the interconnected-ness of the world.  The way in which people can perceive the same event or people in such different ways.  This book is realism and gritty emotion.  It's characters are flawed and real and like each of us in this world fighting their own demons and loss not matter what they appear to be on the surface.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this for my daughter who loves everything anemone and I find myself. spending all of my time at night
1601251505|5.0|The artwork, layout of the material, the quality of the materials used to make the book, the improvements on an already quality gaming system - none of the elements will disappoint. The development team has impressed this gamer. I will recommend this to anyone interested in tabletop roleplaying.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie. Can't wait for the sequel! The movie has a great story. Very interesting. The acting is done well. Also, the costume design is fantastic.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Goofy improbable but fun story, which clearly owes a lot to all those spaghetti westerns of yore.  Suspend disbelief and enjoy.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|When I got it I thought it was gonna be just a kids game. Well maybe it is, I love it though. I can and do spend hours playing it at night. It helps me unwind. I love the different textures/colors in the different packs. It's not to hard or easy, and the music is soothing. I hope they make a bunch of add-on packs. I will probably buy them all.
0439598427|5.0|I originally found this book in a library and my daughter loved it. I do voices for all the characters and make it fun, but this is such a cute book anyway! I love it, I'd recommend it to any child and parent!
B00ALCBU4M|2.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />War movies don't necessarily have to be dead-on accurate.  Band of Brothers, the greatest of them all, takes a few historical liberties, and Glory, the best Civil War movie ever made, makes a lot of historical errors.  Both films get away with it because they maintain historical credulity, and they are well made films.  Company of Heroes doesn't come close on either account.  Its low budget shows, and the story is so inane as to make a Vin Diesel film seem rational.  Moreover, the biggest name in the film, Tom Sizemore, is fat as no soldier in the American GI was after spending six months in the field.<br /><br />The film begins in December 1944 at the start of the Battle of the Bulge, a promising opening that soon deteriorates into absurdity.  Our company of heroes is a small American unit cut off in the Argonne Forest.  A German patrol comes down the road during the night, and the American boys hide in the woods.  What are they doing while trying to escape detection?  Smoking!  As if the Germans couldn't see cigarette glow in a pitch black forest.  Guess what?  They can't!  Not only that, the GIs are hiding behind trees half their body widths, and the Germans can't see them when they scan with their high powered search light.  The Americans kill most of those Germans, escape, and take the place of a dead spy to complete his mission, which they discover has something to do with an atomic bomb, the concept of which seems to be immediately understandable to all of them.  They have to contact a German spy in Stuttgart and hop a German prisoner train to get there.  That's right: a German train going INTO Germany.  To get on board, they shoot down dozens of really stupid Germans who continuously run single file into the line of fire.  Despite their obvious presence on board, the train pulls out on time.  The Americans arrive safely at Stuttgart now joined an escaped British airman and a Russian soldier.  The Germans are waiting, but - you guessed it - fall by the hundreds as the Americans fight their way into town.  While there, they kill a few more Germans for their uniforms and walk down the street speaking English in normal voices, the Russian included.  Meanwhile, the Germans, although knowing they've been infiltrated, do nothing to increase security or locate their foe.  The Americans meet their German contact, who, of course, is a beautiful young woman.  She takes them to her house where she insists they are safe and, in a pointless scene, conveniently forgets to close the bathroom door so the film's hero can view some German booty et al.  Once dressed, she informs them that the Nazi's first atomic bomb test had fizzled but a reluctant German scientist (her father we later learn but which we've already surmised) has resolved the technical problem.  The Americans' mission is ensure a second A-bomb is deactivated and destroyed and the plans sent to the Allies.  (Earth to writer:  the Germans didn't have one atomic bomb, much less two.)  And last but not least, in the big climax, an American bombing raid levels the atomic bomb factory but does so at such a low altitude that the explosions might take out the planes, too.  (Earth once again to writer:  The Army Air Corps never did a bomb run at that low an altitude.)<br /><br />The film is a historical joke and not a very good film in any other regard.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|My daughter and I are reading this together. We are laughing and crying our way through this sweet story. Thanks for the free access- what a blessing as no due date like the library.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a fun game. Could be addictive. You won't be disapointed.  So go ahead and download it. Goahead and have somr fun.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Phenomenal read, inspirational, touchingly sweet and amazing! I Loved every second, my heart was racing with them all! Now to get off my butt and go run.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|One of the most emotionally driven movies I have seen in a while.<br /><br />Cinematography keeps you right there through the horror, heartache, and triumph experienced by a family that finds themselves in the middle of a tsunami.<br /><br />Definitely not a blockbuster blow em up feel good movie, but I am so glad that it is engaging.
B0091REZMW|2.0|It's a Ravenhearst knock-off with all the annoyances of a Facebook game.  :/  I want to be able to pay once and play the game...not constantly pay.  The pic of the model annoys me.  &#34;Sexy&#34; pics aren't needed on EVERYTHING.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent film!  A perspective of politics from that era was eyeopening since I've never seen a film focusing on that theme.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Pros:  Several different kinds of sounds to choose from, plus a few premade mixes that are pretty useful.<br /><br />Cons:  Not a fan of having to purchase additional tones.
B009NCM248|5.0|House of Gold and Bones is one of the best CDs I have purchased in my life. Corey Taylor has outdone himself.<br /><br />Part One is a very good primer, and necessary, to Part Two.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a lot of fun every day of the day, month or year.  thanks for the great time when I am bored
0812993845|3.0|I was super excited to get my hands on this book and honestly was a tiny bit letdown by the end of the novel. It still has Sophie's typical cute, lighthearted with some real emotion thrown in, plus some real laughs but I wasn't as dazzled by this latest novel. It felt more like a Madeleine Wickham novel than Sophie Kinsella but it was still a good read and a nice escape. It's good but I've Got Your Number or the Shopaholic books rated higher on the delightful scale.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can't believe the amount of research that had to go in to accurately portray the time and the history during the late 50's and early 60's.  This was my era and I remember the conflict, the suspicion and conspiracy theories.  The &#34;coulda, woulda, shouldas&#34; where all wrapped up in this book and the possibilities endless for countless alternative futures. I loved it.  I believe it's not only one of Stephen King's best, but one of THE BEST books out there.  Highly recommend it.
0449227421|4.0|Ken Follett's The Third Twin is a timely novel about the scientific possibilities of cloning - and the frightening side.  Interesting read.
0061537969|5.0|Great story line, well written.  I suggest it for anyone who has lost a well loved family dog in recent days.  It helps to deal with some of the sorrow, and pain
0525953728|4.0|The book was very good except it took a long time to get to the end for Osama. These special forces guys deserve the countrys gratatude without hesitation.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Loads of fun.  I actually enjoy watching her work it to try to solve the puzzle.  Comes with a little cone stand so it does not randomly roll around when she sets it down.  Nice.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been a console gamer for most of my life, and only just in the past couple of years have I started PC gaming. When my basic mouse's clickwheel died, I decided to invest in an actual gaming mouse. After looking around, I decided on this mouse. Its done well for me in a number of games. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to game. Its receptive, has multiple programable buttons, and does what I want it to.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I just read my first Colleen Hoover book \\"Hopeless\\" and it was amazing! Since I loved her writing so much I quickly moved on to read \\"Slammed\\" and I thought I was emotionally drained after Hopeless but then Slammed grabbed my heart and I went on another roller coaster ride. Colleen Hoover is amazing and her stories are heart stopping! I can't wait to read Point of Retreat...If you like to have her heart in a story...read this book!!!
0385344228|2.0|There were some positives in this book, but they are far outweighed by the negatives. The main problem, as mentioned by other reviewers is that the story takes a long, long time to unfold with a tremendous amount of boring material.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome it allows you to build whatever you want. Totally recommend this game<br />It is the bomb .SWAGGER
B008BTC5E6|2.0|This is more about Scott than anything else.  Get Born to Run, then if you're interested in doing ultras, get Relentless Forward Progress.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing. I recommend this for anyone of all ages. I read it in like honestly a day and a half
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK AND NEVER WANTED IT TO END. THE AUTHOR'S DESCRIPTIONS MADE ME FEEL LIKE I  WAS RIGHT THERE. IT HAD A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING FROM LAUGHTER TO SADNESS AND BACK AGAIN.<br />I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE AUTHOR THAT I AM NOW READING HER PREVIOUS BOOK &#34;THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR LOVER&#34;
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is a really fun game. I think it is the best of the cut the rope games that Zepto labs has created. I hope they keep them coming with new and unique games

B007TNQ7EY|2.0|This is a greatgame but it's annoying when I died I lost all my expensiveweapons which took me the entire gametoget.
0316077046|3.0|Read Beautiful Darkness finally... It is book two in the Beautiful Creatures series by Kami Garcia. It was a HUGE disappointment to me. I LOVED book one but book 2... It was so boring. I literally took 2 days to read it cause I just couldn't get into it. It finally picked up and got my interest like 60 pages from the end. I just couldn't get into this book. also the ending was really annoying. The storyline seems to just go on and on and on with no progress. They solve it. but then... what do you know... its there again, just waiting for the next claiming moon... so what was the point of any of the events in this book if the problem is just gonna keep resurfacing?  I also I think some of my disappointment had to do with getting only one point of view. I knew it would be but since most of the book was just Ethan feeling sorry for himself and Lena acting like a huge B to him with out her point of view to see where she was coming from I really disliked her. It wasn't until the end when we finally got some insight into her feelings that I understood why she was acting like a huge B. I really hope book 3 is better or I am done with the series.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love It! Just having a blast with cut the rope. It is getting harder now, but that is to be expected. The little frog's (I think it's a frog) expressions are priceless. Lots of fun!
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|Even after all these years, this movie is still great. The chemistry, the story line, great actors, it all works. Definitely a chick flick!  : )
B0063GORYU|2.0|I just do not get this game. I like solitaire games and I know this is popular, but I guess it just is not my cup of tea. Sorry!
B000XA5K48|4.0|The storyline can be somewhat &#34;far fetched&#34; at times, but a good movie to just sit back and relax with friends for a good time.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|The first half was very boring, and there was no real ending to the book. Unfortunately I would not recommend.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Had some really funny moments. Paul Rudd + Albert Brooks are awesome. It kind of dragged on like a weird improv sketch and probably could've been 30-45 minutes shorter.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is beautiful, fun and addictive! It's easy to use for just a few minutes a day or you can spend hours playing. Enjoy!
B00A81MV3U|1.0|The movie was so backwards from the book that I thought I was watching a totally different movie.<br /><br />His father in the movie is nothing like the book.  He is nothing like the book.  Whole parts were left out of the movie, parts of tailgate parties, his therapist...even the music that drove him crazy from his wedding....in the book it was Kenny G.  Much funnier.  Plus, he was not gone for 8 months, more like 2-3 years.<br /><br />The movie was absurd and I wish I would have stopped with the book.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game!  the animals are so cool. I play this every day tor about two hours. sometimes because the animals are so cool.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|battery hd gives you up to the minute information about your battery. I am using it on my amazon kindle fire. I can look at the app and know exactly how much time I have left to read listen to music play games or surf the web. very very helpful.
B003QSOE0U|1.0|Poor acting, historical BS with CGI overkill.  Good and historically accurate movies on this subject are Tora, Tora, Tora and 30 Seconds Over Tokyo,  See those and skip Pearl Harbor.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|It's a really nice book, an easy read, and i think it's pretty honest. I don't quite see why it's so controversial. The book is short and to the point. It doesn't go into a couple of closely tied topics (organizational setbacks, pressures that men face that women don't or don't as much), but I think Ms. Sandberg admits that quite openly, so I don't think it's a problem.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Eclipse answered a ton of questions and just as the previous two movies gave more incite into the less savage account of Vampirism while at the same time showing that not all vampires were loveable, cuddly  beautiful darlings - this movie seemed to go well indepth at showing a kinder and better werewolf - and why they were not so much a creature to be dreaded as all previous movies had portrayed them but actually a protector of sorts. And in it's zeal to be the protectors of humans, would even work with &#34;good&#34; vampires (their actual sworn enemy) in order to protect the humans if they had too. Never mind the fact that Jacob Black had grown from a cute young boy to a very beautiful and very loving young man who co-incidently also loved Bella Swan as fiercely as his rival Edward.<br /><br />I loved the fact I wanted Edward and Bella together, but at the same time I wanted that same perfect joy and love for Jacob. I believe I was feeling as conflicted as Bella was obvious feeling - even though there was no doubt from the very beginning it was as Bella said - she loved them both, but she loved Edward more.<br /><br />I loved all the action of Eclipse, I think the best of all the movies - the protections they provided Bella - the big battle and exposing the fact the Voltori were not quite the good Vampire Law makers they pretended to be - but were selfish and self righteous pigs. I have to say I learned to purely detest Jane from the prior movie and again saw  my detesting of her grow when she could have prevented any battle with the Cullins, and chose not to - so it did my heart good to see her again miffed by the Cullins coming through what she wanted to happen to them and what actually did happen. It further confirmed my detest of Jane and the Voltari, when they handled the situation of the remaining &#34;newborn&#34; in the manner they did - as if she was not satisfied unless she always had the final word and showed her &#34;power&#34;. (Kudos goes to the adorable Dakota Fanning - who I actually love to pieces - and her very right on performance of the ruthless Jane.  She allowed me to hate Jane, while still truly adoring her real sweet self. Now that was acting perfection).<br /><br />Needless to say the end of this movie left me compelled to see the next movie even though I knew in my heart it would be the &#34;forever after&#34; fairytale ending it deserved - I truly wanted to see that big wedding and enjoyed the fact knowing Bella had left all details in very capable hands. I was also curious how this would all be handled by Jacob who had left no doubt at all in the fact he truly and completely loved Bella.
B004U52VPS|5.0|the price was unbeatable on amazon. My kids loved it for some time now they love their video games but come back to this every now and again
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|It has been a long time since I sat and watched a black and white movie.  This one brought emotions to the surface and kept them there for the entirety of the movie.  it made me believe that there were actually good people in the midst of all the atrocities of that war.

B00AZL3PBK|1.0|My 6 year old son downloaded this game thinking that it was free. It was removed before it could be played with.
B001OL4TR4|5.0|Ladyhawke is one of my favorite childhood movies and I am thrilled it is free with a prime membership.  A Grimm-style tale with sword fights, a mysterious heroine (Michelle Pfeiffer), a handsome knight, an evil cardinal, and a hilarious thief (Matthew Broderick) named Mouse. The only issue I had as a modern viewer was the somewhat unusual soundtrack -- a bit jarring in places.
6305428352|5.0|This movie is a must see.Dreyfuss is good in the lead role and the plot is well developed. The roles of his wife and son were well done.It is a story about a mans realization that although he never really achieved his goal in life,he helped shape the lives of many people and was well loved and had a very meaningful life.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a real workout.  I have recommended it to several people, men and women.  She will kick your butt.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|I had watched this movie many years ago and remembered it as being good so I bought it to watch again. Very good acting from both Richard Gere and Jodie Foster. I thought the little boy who played their son was also good.I cried at the ending.Very touching movie.I recommend it if you don't mind having a little cry.Not all stories have a happy ending and this one was done well,I definitely felt connected to the characters and was moved by their dilemma.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|This show is simply a classic. Picard is my favorite captain out of all the series hands down. Maybe its because I grew up with it but it never gets old.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This is an AMAZING book and it goes very well with Beautiful Creatures. I would recommend this book to everyone who has read the first book :)
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charges much faster than the adapter that came with my Nexus 10. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I wish I found this game before temple run.. it gets you pumped and ready to move when things come in your way. I found it easy to connect this game to my everyday life as a routine to have and enjoyable day.. everyone should definitely play this game
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Simply over rated trilogy. I was curious about the book because I couldn't get thru one of my parties on the weekend without it being topic of conversation. So. Y fiancé bought it for me. I kept waiting for climax of the story and it never came. It's almost like the author was scared to be vulgar and simple which would've made the story better. I refuse to read the complete trilogy and I usually do. But this didn't make the cut for me. Too immature, repetitive, unrealistic.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It was kind of different for me but I read it to the end to ee how it would end.
B0036TGT3E|2.0|personally i love this movie but when i first watch this movie on blu ray, i was very disappointed to find there is no theatrical version of this movie. the musical from the new version suck compare to the otv.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|If you put it in your mouth and eat it, you need to see this. This documentary not only tells us about our food, but the big conglomerations that have their greedy hands around the necks of our producers and are squeezing the life out of them. I'm watching this thinking, this is America?  At the same time I'm learning about putting in a garden again and knowing where my food comes from and what goes into it.  You can grow food almost anywhere, so learn how to do it. Your survival may depend on it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I've read the books before this one and they are all so truly amazing!! To me they are the best books of all the history of books!!!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|nice and fun! great game and very entertaining! the effects are very entertaining. i also love the background musi because it is very relaxing. beautiful colors too!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Been playing around with Dragonvale for a couple of weeks now, and it is a lot of fun. The more I play it, the more I enjoy it
6305291446|3.0|Not a bad movie when comparing it to the previous sequels. It's worth watching if you're a true &#34;Halloween&#34; fan.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Everyone in this benighted country of ours should watch this movie and take it to heart.  I think students would benefit greatly by seeing how a great leader full of passion for his ideals managed to prevail over those bigots who would have defeated the 13th amendment.
0061726834|4.0|Originally published here: [...]<br /><br />You've probably already read it and any other opionion on it would be useless. For me, this novel has been a re-read and I've felt like sharing my thoughts. Which novel am I talking about? Well, but Delirium by Lauren Oliver, an author I've already appreciated in Before I fall. Delirium is the first installment in a dystopic series I've loved for the story, the characters and the captivating writing.<br /><br />Lena lives in a world where love is considered an illness, something that has to be cured; every girl and boy, once they're 18, undergoes a treatment that will bring them not to feel any strong emotion, especially love. Their life will follow a preordered path and everything will be perfect, that's what they are taught. When Lena meets Alex, a guy she thought was cured, everything changes... and the rules she's been following will be disregarded...<br /><br />The first time I picked up this book I wasn't that impressed by the plot; I love a good dystopic book but I just couldn't seem to be interested in this world building... but I couldn't help falling in love with Lena's story and powerful voice. Yes, I did love it but I don't think I could have liked it without Lena and Hana, such strong, complex heroines, full of contradictions.<br /><br />Lena is the absolute protagonist of this novel; I really liked Hana and Alex, the guy Lena falls in love with, her complex personality, with lot of different layers and shades, makes her such a wonderful and interesting heroine. I loved watching her slowly growing up, struggling with her emotions and her beliefs, seeing her change with the unraveling of the plot. Can't wait to see that the future has in store for her.<br /><br />Hana is another great character and the more I read this book, the more I want to know more about her; at the beginning, Hana is the rebellious one, the one that brings Lena to unauthorized parties and help her with Alex. I really want to see more of Hana.<br /><br />Oliver's writing is powerful and wonderful, without being cheesy or trivial; she can keep up on the edge and OMG THE ENDING was totally illegal. Deeply introspective, Delirium is a great read and I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />My favourite quote:<br /><br />Love: It will kill you and save you, both
B00A757EFW|5.0|In the past I used to love Pac-Man but it went out of style and we had not played it in a very long time, we got this as a laugh but we really like it and use it especially on trips
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son Tour on magnificent display from the greatest band of all time!!! Will they play Muskego Fest?!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My niece loves to take care of the pets, but how do you update the app? I have the app on my phone as well and it automatically updates by its self.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|So awesomely awesomeness awesome and land use of monsters and the other hand and the lego store open in sea of monsters and the other side of monsters and
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I thought it would be good, but was disappointed. The music is very annoying and adds nothing to it. The violence is very extreme and far fetched. One guy basically shoots an army of men with a pistol. I like the idea of this movie but somehow this totally misses it.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|Both my three year old and I love Sofia, and it is awesome having a DVD to play whenever we want.<br />Can't wait for the next!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love magic the gathering and this is just like it. the gameplay is amazing. I love it and so will you
B005HED08I|5.0|I just love the Amazon Prime Video app being able to watch the videos on my phone on Wi-Fi is great.  As far as Star Trek it is great to see the original series once again
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like building cities and this hived me something fun to do. I do wish it was easier to get energy though.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|The case provides protection for my Voyager Pro Bluetooth Headset from the elements and fits easily in my pocket. I like that the case is a good smooth black leather.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great sequel to the original. Works very well on my Kindle Fire! Try it. You'll like it! I do!
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|This game is fun as any &#34;Match 3&#34; game goes.  The rebuilding of the tree of life gives it a bit of a twist.  If you like this type of game you will enjoy this one.  The unlocking of the trapped tiles is a little different too.  Give it a whirl and enjoy.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked the story epically the tie in with one of my favorite stories, It.  The story line is good and it kept my interest.  I thought it has some good twists on you typical time travel stories.  The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that I would have liked it to be a little darker with some parts that make you flinch.
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|I always love Jessie Ware and couldn't wait till this album came out, so I blast her music legally lol :)
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|Excellent performance by Russell Crowe. A well-paced thriller. It drew the rest of the family into the living room to enjoy it together.
B005GSY23M|5.0|The best track in the album is &#34;A real hero&#34;. &#34;Under your spell&#34; comes next. This album is a must buy, must hear and a must keep. Buy original from Amazon. Listen to it on your iOS via the Amazon cloud player or download to PC and sync to multiple devices.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I love this movie.  Some of the voices could be better, but the acting makes up for it.  The sets are beautifully done as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I decided I'd figure out what all the hype was for myself... and I was hooked!!! If you understand that yes, there WILL be racy explicit sex scenes, you will try to understand the storyline behind it. It is about a young man that was severely abused from year childhood all the way through his adolescent years. And he was never shown the true concept and beauty of real love. The woman in this book has a frank innocence that is starkly shattered the day she meets Christian Grey. Yet her belief in love, happiness and joy overrides his conditioned-response of dominating to one of compromise and the beginnings of love. This book certainly knows how to turn a woman on, yet it is also a story of light vs dark, and the light always wins in the end :)
B005VPRFSY|5.0|My grandson is into Legos (especially space related) so I got this for his fifth birthday.  He has had a lot of fun building and re-building it.  Legos are an excellent choice for those kids who enjoy them.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|This movie was boring.  I kept waiting for it to get better and finally gave up when I couldn't take it anymore.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is one I can watch over and over again. Whenever it's on, I feel like I'm visiting with an old friend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game!!!!!! Made out of blocks oh thought of who ever did needs to mak<br />a million dollars a day
B00009R6H2|5.0|If you will be using more than one connection to certain Manfrotto tripod heads, these are the way to go. However, attached to lenses, they are bulky enough to make lens storage or holsters unusable.
B008602KQI|1.0|The movie just wasn't what I expected. I loved the books. The movie didn't explain anything, and was too fragmented.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|love it almost exactlly like GTA free on kindle tried to et it on my phone using google plahy store its 4.99!!! would pay it now knowing how great it is but have it oin kindle good enough!!
0684824906|5.0|The details were fascinating. This book is an easy read. I couldn't put the book down. I have several books by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
B004XMMSZG|5.0|Replaced my DockBoss.  Sound is actually much clearer than the 3.5mm jack.<br />Also, I was able to have this paired to my Samsung Galaxy S3 at the same time as my car's handsfree.  Transitions between them without manual intervention.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Too much focas on tortured scenes. The point was made early on but the torture continued.<br />The preparation of the actual operation and the mission was lacking. All of a sudden the seal team is on the way. The scenes of the raid are too dark-almost black. The acting is OK.<br /><br />The made for TV version with the same story line is 5 stars.<br />I give zero dark thirty 2 above zero.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|You are missing something key here. When your users browse, they often click on pics or articles. Often, getting back to the news feed is a pain, and when that is achieved, one has to scroll allll the way down to where they were looking in their feed again. Backspace ones to the top of the page every time,  which is why I will be returning to using the browser for Facebook.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I was sucked in straight away...I love books like this that you stay up until 2am reading even though the alarm clock is set for 6am!! Written fantastically, with such depth of character and story line!! I didn't want it to end!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Much better then book one. Very emotional, and definitely kept me guessing. I am really looking forward to reading the last book!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I never knew this really happened before. It is nice to know the facts of what really happened during the Iran hostage period.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Provides a lot of security for free.  No glitches and I have been using it for a couple of years now.
0062225677|5.0|I've been a long time fan of the Discworld series but i was only when reviewing a book by new author Tim McFarlane that I remembered how much I enjoyed these books. The running gag with the luggage just kept me chuckling all the way. Wonderful characters and situations. Can't recommend it highly enough.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|I like the premise..but the slider bar at the bottom left corner of the screen is awkward and hard to maneuver when making turns or trying to slide into spots....
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|you can keep your journal or your diary, a todo list anything and everything lol you cqn also have a password to keep people from getting into your books
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|I really didn't know how I was going to feel abiut this movie considering the reviews. I rented it anyways and ended up loving it! It's definitely worth buying
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Five stars<br />I chose this rating because just reading this book could change people.<br />I liked all of it.<br />I would recommend this to one of my best friends.
030758836X|2.0|Receiver sent it to me to read and I have to say it was a strange book.<br />Receiver didn't like the book either.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|ok I dream the songs and sing along every night and play daily in my car when off or back to school.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Always a great read with Jack Reacher.  Can't imagine casting Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. I have read mostr of Lee Child's books.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|suspenseful, action packed, fun plot twists, Mickey Rourke is spectacular as usual, cant wait for the next one, tech is fun
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Wasn't sure how I was going to like this though I heard it was good. Well, the setting and the characters were all great and by the time I got to te end I felt like this was a movie I would watch again and again. It had a great message that will inspire you especially when you feel like you are off track in your life.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have been a Downton fan since it started and I own all three series on DVD.  Lovely setting, great actors and great story.  Very nice change from the awful reality TV and some of the typical sitcoms.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have this game on my pc would recommend for EVERYONE super interesting Battling ZOMBIES SKELOTONS AND CREEPER WITH YOUR DIAMOND SWORD IS EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Though on this edition i wish it had more items and biomes.
B0031R5K72|5.0|The use of descriptions and metaphors in The Book Thief was amazing, it kept me glued until the end.<br />One minute you loved the characters next you disliked them. One felt part of the village and their ordeals during the war.<br />It was recommended to me & I will recommend the book to other readers.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|love the dvd and preorder ability, so i received it shortly after its release. Bought 2 1 for my son also he loved it too.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|The Blu-rays arrived, not only on time, but over a week sooner than expected.  All arrived in excellent condition.  I'm already half way through the 2nd season.  I really enjoy the feature on the Blu-rays that allow you to choose either the series as originally taped, or with enhanced special effects.  Right now, I'm watching the enhanced SE features--really cool!  Thank you Amazon; I'm already compiling a list of dvd's/Blu-rays to order.
B008602KQI|4.0|Thought it didn't follow the book, it was a good movie to watch for someone that hadn't read the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|block story is a lot cheeper and better but I love this game anyways.<br /><br />block story is a lot cheeper and better but this is better than roblox
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I love Bond movies. I have always loved Bond movies. This movie made me want to take a nap. It seemed like it just went on and on and on and on and on....and on....you get the idea. There was way too much sidelining and backstory&#34;ing,&#34; and not nearly enough Bond action or gadgets.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I absolutely love this TV series!  I'm totally hooked!!  I love all of the story lines & character development.  Almost done with Season 2!
B00190OHD6|5.0|I am NOT a romance reader, but someone ended up giving me this book as a gift several years ago, and I loved it. The book cracked me up, entertained me, and very nearly made me cry. I had to see the movie. The movie was not quite in line with the book, but most definitely worth watching! So funny, entertaining and heartwarming/heartbreaking.
0439023521|5.0|i finally watched the first part of the movie and lobved it, now i am going to read the book, great price, fast shippping
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|My fourth graders really enjoyed this movie, but I felt that it was just so-so as far as animated movies go. Worth seeing once, but don't buy the DVD, as it's not one of those titles you or your kids will want to watch over and over again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm about halfway through Silver Linings and I can't wait to finish so I can see the movie and compare. It's a great storyline so far.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|If you're not expecting this to blow you out of the water, you'll enjoy it. The vomiting scenes are completely stupid and definitely remove the movie from the &#34;love it&#34; category, but the rest of the movie is great. The soundtrack is peppy and keeps you engaged, and the story isn't so bad, either. Worth it just for the music, but also fun to watch.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song isn't going to blow your mind, but it will definitely stick in there. You'll find yourself singing it for days after listening. You'll have the unrelenting urge to listen to it again. There is nothing wrong with that.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I watched this movie in theaters with my nephew when it was first released, and we both loved it! He will still re-watch it to this day, and so will I. It's got a refreshingly different take on the villain character, and I like that it at least acknowledges the problems and struggles foster kids can face, though it certainly isn't a heartfelt documentary or anything. It's very funny, and absolutely worth watching!
B00B19H2KU|5.0|They built up the tension not just through the spooky stuff going on, but because of the situation between the parents. Sometimes you weren't sure what was real and what wasn't because there was some emotional family drama going on, too. Good special effects and a few interesting jump scenes.<br /><br />Supernatural fans will think it's funny that John Winchester can't sort out a demon on his own.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I started watching &#34;Castle&#34; after &#34;Bones&#34; lost it's fervor post-baby, and found it fun, exciting and enjoyable. Unfortunately, like &#34;Bones&#34; after Booth and Bones got pregnant, the show has lost some of its excitement now that SPOILER ALERT Beckett and Castle are officially together. I don't find myself wondering what's going to happen on the next episode, but I enjoy watching nonetheless.
B00B6DTIGW|4.0|This was one of those movies that was good at building up the tension. As it went on, you felt more and more drawn in and worried about the characters. Then at the end, it all just sort of pooped out. They either needed to play up the &#34;bad guy&#34; a little more at end, or not give him such a lead in. By the time things happened, I felt like saying, &#34;Oh really? After all this? That was it?&#34; The last 10 minutes snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.
B002FOAVGC|5.0|Just all around enjoyed this movie. Interesting premise and exciting story. It does not take long to get going, and once it does it's a great ride. Excellent &#34;documentary-style&#34; camera work as well.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Literally every attempt to watch a video gives the &quot;vtube has stopped&quot; error message. Not exaggerating, I haven't been able to watch even ONE video via this app - it does nothing but error. Simply put, this app does not work. Keep looking.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book jumped around from past to present too often without answering questions that I as a reader had.  I could not recommend it.
1609611543|3.0|The scientific ideas about wheat presented in this book are both easy to understand and related to the topic.  My father in law has followed this diet and gotten his out of control diabetes back in control.  It got demoted a couple of stars for the sometimes propaganda-esque tone to the book and the fact that the author is out of touch with how expensive some of his food suggestions really are (try to each only grass fed beef is one).  I don't care how you reason it, many people are not doctors and cannot afford to buy the ingredients he pitches.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Doesn't work properly with Kindle Fire. Disappointing experience. I often have to take notes and was really looking forward to using it on my device.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|First off, let me say I have read Les Mis (an excerpt in French and the entire book in English) and I love it.  The musical leaves some stuff out.  All the musical adaptions I have.  I must say when I first found out that Anne Hathaway was Fontine, I was not happy.  But now I am glad.  She portrays Fontine so well!  Also, Amanda is a good Cosette.  I do NOT know if I would have even gone to see the movie if Taylor Swift had been Cosette - because face it, she has no vocal range and Cosette is a soprano.  Hugh Jackman went along way from Wolverine to become Valjean - a very good Valjean.<br /><br />What makes this musical unique is that they actually sing live.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|EXCELENT
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great Movie, bought it for my boyfriend as a birthday present, he watches it all the time, his favorite movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is my favorite site! It is much more productive than some of the other sites I used to spend my free time on. I have no complaints at all about the app. It seems to be just as functional as the main site.
B000W089XS|5.0|One of my favorites with my namesake, Lauren Bacall. I think most people love this movie for Marilyn or Betty....all three make this a classic any classic movie lover should have in their collection.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book while good, does not explore even similar themes to the first book, and does not compare with &#34;Ender's Game&#34;
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Started at season one and now I'm hooked. Really great story line. I could just do without all the gore. Sometimes it can be a bit excessive.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very entertaining and a fast read. Simple story with deep meaning. I'll never look at dogs the same way again.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|It struck me as odd how many people got involved in the metaphysical debate over whether or not this extremely well crafted film actually stands as a &#34;proof&#34; of God.  I do not believe the film even attempts to &#34;prove&#34; the existence of God, at least not in any scientific or empirical sense of the word &#34;proof&#34;.  Instead, the film presents an excellent humanist justification for faith, one that deftly avoids the scientific debate by focusing on preferences rather than proof (e.g. &#34;Which story do you prefer?&#34;).
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I like it it is a good thing to practice peanio on I was bad at this but now I am good hop you like it
B009CGKW10|4.0|The effects are a bit dated and the film plods at times, but overall a fun and enjoyable way to pass a few hours.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator is a VERY useful tool for every one, but extremely important for business oriented persons, students, accountants, etc. It eliminates the need of an additional &#34;gadget&#34;, the well known calculator, as digital items such as tablets and smart phones are found everywhere. It is user friendly as resembles the regular calculator and uses standard denominations.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The ending was a bit overwrought and at times it felt contrived but overall a very enjoyable movie inspired by an interesting historical event.  It was unfortunate that Mr. Affleck chose to include the lines about the CIA &#34;disclaiming&#34; their role, implying that Canada's public recognition was a ruse.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is a nice entertainment tool for idle time or when you need to detach yourself for some minutes from something that is causing you trouble. Is an assistant to further develop skills such as attention to details, speed in thinking and decision making. It is very good to have this game available on the tablet too, because it is a &#34;old&#34; game, which most persons know and had enjoyed in first time computer systems.
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|It's about time that Iron Maiden edit this kick-ass show on DVD. I have the original release on VHS and is indeed the main reason I still have my old VCR. The extras are fantastic. This is an A+++++++<br /><br />Up the irons!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google search is a  fast and efficient searching tool. Most links are for trusted sites, or at least are properly identified as such. Whatever approach to searching Google uses is very efficient. There is no need to be a &#34;wizard&#34; computer expert to achieve results in any search, due to its simple presentation, which is a convenient box in an uncluttered screen. It is a blessing that it is available for all gadgets such as computers, smart phones, tablets, etc.
B001DEXDNI|5.0|I live this CD have not seen much from her lately and was so glad to find thi.  I play it in my car all the time
B004J4WN0I|5.0|...but also laugh-out-loud funny in spots. You don't need to know Irish mythology to enjoy the book, but I think I know a lot more now than when I began. A few good characters, both human and divine, that should get well developed in subsequent books. I can't wait.
B008C20TDG|5.0|The book is highly informative, giving perfectly useful alternatives to the way we eat today and giving valid knowledge of why we should change that.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I will be the first to admit that I am not a huge fan of this musical, but I have to admit this is an amazing film. I Love that everyone sang live for a movie musical this has made a huge difference and I hope that other movie musicals take this queue and start to film in this way. Nothing I hate more than the sound being off from the actors mouthing the words.<br />Give this film a try. If you don't like it, you can at least say you tried.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I received a Kindle Fire Hd for my birthday and Subway surfers was one of the first games I played.It has awesome graphics and unique gameplay, controls are simple yet the game can be a challenge. If you are a fan of Temple Run I recommend this to you.
B0027BVMSY|5.0|It's a good James Bond flim, not the exact same movie as Casino Royale, but good in its own way.<br /><br />If you're expecting Casino Royale 2, you may not really like this movie, because as I said, it's a bit different.  However I'm sure that any real Bond fan will enjoy this film.
B008HK3SO0|4.0|I liked the case very much but I wish the flap had been longer.  The flap barely fastens to the<br />case body.  The sleeve case for my older 7&#34; Kindle fit much better.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Finally a full function interface - I was always running into limits with the amazon app store but this broke out.  Now let's see if they release a phone optimized version... :-)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander's story of his near death experience is explained with wonderful clarity that will assure believers and temp non-believers to re-think their posution on an all powerful loving God.  Outsatnding book and Amazon's prices are always right.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|While this book is a scaffolding of character building and deep inferences which makes for interesting reading, it takes a bit over 100 pages to become a truly cohesive story. I enjoyed the historic fiction of twists and turns. This story pulls at your heartstrings.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|It doesn't work.  I tried it for a week and I didn't lose any weight.  Very disappointed in the produce.
B00CL68RLU|4.0|Five stars for suspense and 3 stars for reality.  A criminal that is so smart that he can con everyone in law enforcement and then get away with it for months. Not to mention the FBI continuing to use a former agent who refuses to not follow orders.  Give me a break.  If we totally eliminated all the foolishness of the law enforcement and wrote the major portion of the script around the cult and their leaders, the show would move quicker.  Kevin Bacon makes a better villain than hero, so I would have cast him in the role of the cult leader/professor/serial killer.  So far, the writing does keep your attention but if this story does not start showing law enforcement in a better light, it may go the way of the TV shows Alcatraz and Hotel 666.  A few smart criminals vs a whole bureau of dumb Federal agents and the criminals always wins.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great story and action packed !  Similar story as the great Arnold Schwarzenegger &#34;Running Man&#34; movie. Being in HD was a plus.
B009410J9I|4.0|When I saw this at the store of The Stray Cats Live in 1981, I thought that it would just be some raw coffee house venue performance because I never heard of them here in America til around the end of 1982. When I first heard &#34;Rock This Town&#34;, I thought that it was some new material from The Kingbees. They being a rockabilly band out of LA, that was rather popular in Detroit when I lived there.<br /><br />Anyway, performing live from 1981, I couldn't believe how that huge audience there were already into the band like they've been hearing The Stray Cats for years. I was wondering, &#34;Were they the opening act for some other band?&#34; because there was a lot of people there too.<br /><br />Upon doing some research, I found that the Stray Cats released their first album in the UK in February of 1981.  We in the states didn't get their first album &#34;Built For Speed&#34; until July of 1982. 17 months later.  What's up with that? Was the American music industry resisting their style and dissing them to where they had to make it big in Europe first?<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a Stray Cats fan or a Brian Setzer Orchestra fan, this is a great concert to own on DVD. For years I've always wanted to own some early concert footage of such a great band like the Stray Cats.  Even their most recently filmed shows (like &#34;Live in Brixton&#34;) is a treasure to own.<br /><br />It looks like this DVD is also down to just being a few copies left for sale. So, jump on it if you see it. If you're reading this review, than, guess what? You know you want it!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this game is so much fun!!!! so much better than the original!!!!! I love this game so much its a lot of fun!!!!
B000004166|5.0|Just the name MOZART evokes in  mind a great piece in its totality.  A world of imitators,never equalized, A piece of music made of harmonious notes with a profound calming effect on the mind.  NO need for tranquilizers meds.  I recommend it heartily.
034580404X|5.0|These books are FABULOUS!!!! The best books ever written! I am going to read and reread these books over and over again.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I like games like Where's my Water and others that are cute and make you use your gray-matter. This is one of the most fun and imaginative games to play. I figured out most of the scenes, but have to admit I had to use the internet to help out on a handful.  Makes me wonder how many words this game acknowledges...You tell the game what you want it to make to help get you through each scene and if it's correct, you move on until the scene is completed and the starlite falls from the progress bar. Some scenes are more challenging than others, but you have a few hints to help you along. Played on a KF.
B00138J6VM|5.0|This album is a timeless classic!! And I scored a great price!! How could anyone go wrong!! Your gonna luv it!!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is incredibly well written and composed music; one of the best bands around right now. A bright light in an otherwise dark room...
B001P1MZNI|5.0|The Legend lives on in this production! Every time I listen to Frank, it takes me back to a time when all was Kool and Sleek!<br />The Rat-Pack master live's on!!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Persuasion is one of my favourite Jane Austen´s novels. It is maybe the more romantic of her novels. Their characters are not so unforgettable as those of Pride & Prejudice, and it has less irony than previous novels of this wonderful writer, but the story as a whole is very beautiful, and you cannot stop reading it...
B002OSAT7U|5.0|WOW!!! I heard a kool track while streaming on Groove Shark and it was these cat's!! Awesome music!! I have 3 of their albums now...addicting!!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|My grandson spends the night some times and I bought it for him because he is Angry Birds crazy. He plays it so I am forced to play sometimes with him...I don't care for Angry Birds but he likes it, he is 5 so I guess he likes it ok.  Hoping he will out grow liking it, I think the whole think is lame.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton is a great drama that people from all walks of life will love. It provides an interesting perspective on England around the turn of the century that is unmatched by anything I've seen to date. Twists, turns, cliffhangers, and various plot devices will likely have you throwing things at the TV in disbelief.<br /><br />The one thing that really sets Downton apart from many other shows is the cinematography. All shows are (of course) in high definition these days, but many of them don't really highlight how much HD really adds to the experience. Downton really shines in this area with sweeping panoramas, unique angles, and some motion work that'll just blow your mind. In one instance, the camera literally switches from person to person by following them through the mansion and then flipping to another character as they pass by, thus giving you a single shot that contains an incredible amount of detail. You just have to see it. The only other show that's done this well is 24.<br /><br />Start with Season 1 if you haven't seen it already, and then pick up here in Season 2. You won't be able to stop watching! Season 3 lands on Amazon Prime in June, so don't miss it!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It left me disappointed. I like fantasy but this did not satisfy that need.  I sure would not want to see the movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book for children over 10 and for everybody who loves a great human story!  The language is spot on in dealing with feelings and life's unexpected turns.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Sure puts a new point of view on the record.  Seemed really strange but I did love him as I read on.
B00BESJYAY|3.0|I liked that it was a true story, but it was missing something. Gerard Butler lacked passion for this role. We know he can do better;)
B008LSVLZG|5.0|OK... I don't typically bother writing a review where 70 people have already chimed in, but I will this time just to support what the general opinion is here, because I'm so blown away by this performance. I'm an older prog guy... Raised on Yes, Zep, Rush... moved on to Dream Theater and Symphony X, then Spock's Beard and Porcupine Tree... I'm so bummed that I missed this solo Steven Wilson show when they came to Dallas, but this DVD is the next best thing to being there. I already have the 2 live Porcupine Tree DVD's,(which, by the way, are amazingly produced and great performances) so, after checking out some clips of this on youtube, I knew it would be great.... but I didn't know it would be *this* great! If you're even marginally a Porcupine Tree fan (or for that matter, an Opeth or even Pink Floyd fan... or just interested in getting into modern prog... This might even appeal to jazz fusion fans), be sure to get a copy of this performance. I just got back on Amazon to purchase an EXTRA copy, so that I'd have one to loan to friends. -Yeah... It's THAT good. Don't even hesitate.... Just get it!
B007HU4FZ2|1.0|Good grief, this movie was painful to watch and difficult to understand the dialogue (Aramaic). I didn't finish the movie.
0452289963|5.0|I have read hundreds of books on the subject of spirituality and this one has made the most tangible difference in my life. The message of all enlightened masters such as Buddha and Christ is essentially the same message. It comes through Tolle in such a clear and easy to understand way. Tolle's essential thesis here is that the ego identity is the source of all human suffering. This book is about recognizing that and dropping it, which is the fundamental shift occurring on the \\"new earth\\" - which is the new consciousness coming into humanity during this time period.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love that I can take this game on my kindle<br />just take it out and play anywhere that I am waiting<br />easy to play
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I really enjoyed this story line, and very quickly blew threw the 4 available books in this series.  And I'll likely buy the next one when it comes out.  It's not exactly &#34;unique&#34;, but it's interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing how it all plays out.<br /><br />That said, the fine print execution of the story is tough to swallow.  I just kept thinking &#34;come on, how did THAT happen?!?&#34;  It just seemed...rushed (?) to get the characters to certain places.<br /><br />Like I said - it's 4 stars because the story line has me coming back for more, and I can't do 3.5 stars.  I'm not going to give a book 3 stars when I'm pumping out money for the rest of the series, but there are details that could be done better.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song feels like MJ is still reaching us beyond the grave through Daft Punk, great song you wont regret this purchase.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|So I can give this horrible app a single star more than it deserves!  \o/  I grew up on and love Atari games but the interface is awful.  Also the games are too expensive.
1451695195|5.0|This book was very insightful and was especially interesting in that it came from a doctor with a very scientific orientation who did not believe that what he experienced could even be possible.
0062238868|5.0|I do not read many books, but this book had me wanting to read more.  I was read it in the bathroom, during my lunch break.  Let's just say there were days, my 1 hour lunch break turned into 2 hour lunch breaks.  The time flaw by reading this book.  It make me sad that I will never get the chance to thank Chris for service to our country.
B0014JKJJI|5.0|This is a comfortable slip on shoe for the garden or outdoor use. Washes up well and lasts for a long time.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Gillian Flynn must dark place in her psyche.  Well written very disturbing novel about very sick people.  Not for the insomniac
1476733953|3.0|I'm going to have to add my voice to all the others who think this book doesn't make enough sense. Here were my problems:<br /><br />Living in the post-apocalyptic silo really didn't seem so bad. Almost everyone worked together with great team spirit, had plenty of energy and health, and treated each other with rough, caring, love.<br /><br />On a related note, there was really just one villain. Everyone else seemed perfectly reasonable. Of course this villain is in charge of everything. (And--for those who have already read it--what did everyone else in \\"IT\\" do all day?)<br /><br />Our villain is supposedly following a set of rules to prevent an uprising among the people, but everything he does seems designed to foment an uprising among all these reasonable, caring people. Who wrote this \\"how to run your silo\\" guide? The Marquis de Sade?<br /><br />It was indeed ridiculous that one of these places could function with just one staircase and no elevators.<br /><br />I was also tempted to skip ahead sometimes. The pacing, at times, reminded me of the experience of renting the DVD's of a mini-series and watching them all at once. You just want to hit fast-forward sometimes.<br /><br />But the book has a great setup, some interesting ideas, some great characters, and especially a great, strong female main character. If this review seems overly negative I guess it's because I think this book was almost legitimately great but finally falls short.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Kurt Russell and Jennifer Grey are really great in it. I really like the song choices also. I can watch this movie over and over.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I choose this book cause I heard it was good  I found it a little confusing but continued to read it.  I would recommend it.  I have not read a lot of Grisham books.  Ann
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This works great, easy to access and use. You can't beat the price. And you don't have to watch an ad before using it.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This was very interesting story, especially since I'm  familiar with the area. Have read several books by DeMille, and would recommend them to anyone that enjoys a good story and continuing characters.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Both heart wrenching and heart warming. Christina McKenna was able to beautifully deliver such powerful emotions from within. I laughed, cried and felt profound sorrow. When the book ended I was anxious to locate & read yet another novel but was surprised to find this to be her first on her own. I look fwd to reading her work in the future.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|Much has been made of this \\"masterpiece\\" and frankly there's just not much there 'there'.  I expected an intelligent, mind-bending thriller, but got instead a rather simple, linear story.  Don't expect twists and turns, just more dreams within dreams within dreams, etc...  I like Nolan's work, but this is miles away from his best.  (I also found the James Bond-esque ice fort completely laughable)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Typical Grisham. The complexity and threads leading to the conclusion of the story did leave me a little empty as when cheaters win. Many new locations explored with believable detail made for a satisfactory read.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This is a wonderful film about broken people trying to find wholeness and healing.  It is funny and real and smart.  The superb performances from lead and supporting actors elevate it to the level of minor classic along the lines of As Good As It Gets.  At times it's painful to watch the struggles of the main characters, but ultimately it's a satisfying, feel-good film that does not resort to cliche.<br /><br />My favorite moment is the reaction of Bradley Cooper's character Pat to finishing the novel A Farewell to Arms.  I am not a Hemingway fan and fell in love with the movie right then and there.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is funny, a perfect mix of heartbreaking and charming. So well written, I really satisfying read. I would recommend to others.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD...Great script, storyline fun for kids of all ages. Would like to see another story, especially including &#34;Mom&#34;.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. At first I was upset for Katniss but then she proved that nothing would get in her way. I like the different twists the author put in this book from the way the arena was set up to the strategies being different to try and survive the quell. I like the whole book. Read it in 2 days!!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD...Great script, storyline, and excellent acting (Daniel Day Lewis is superb) should've done better at the Oscars!
B00AV01JPO|5.0|Camus was born in Algeria.  He suffered extreme poverty most of his life.  He felt life had no meaning and there was no God.  He called this the Philosophy of the Absurd.  He wrote as a journalist controversial articles.  You could say he was left-wing.  He is important not just for his philosophy, but for his writing, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize.  His health was deteriorating and he died young.  But he was a talented writer and philosopher.<br />-- Kathleen Collins
B003097B64|5.0|The price for these is unbeatable. The performance and the music itself solid in every way. The only essential item missing from your collection after purchasing this is the Deluxe Waiting for Columbus. (The band is not the same after Lowell George leaves/dies. this is Little Feat, the remaining band is something different, and less - in my opinion. )  The only complaint about this package is the writing on the discs (track listing) is sometimes hard to read, the album covers are a little tight and cheap -- but this has nothing to do with the music: and that is excellent. Buy it, listen to it, and you will not regret it!  Any sonic problems vanishes in the reasonableness of the set's price.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a suggested read by a fellow co-worker, so I figured what the heck.  I LOVED it!  Then I suggested my husband read it and he enjoyed it as well.  I have told many friends and family to read it.  Enjoyed it very much....what a twist!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I had a hard time pulling myself away from this book.  Jodi does it again.  I love her books, she's a great author.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show is well written and the  acting is superb.  If you liked X Files, then you will love Fringe.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|As always...brilliant writing! An excellent plot with surprise and intrigue on every page!  Am waiting in anticipation for the next one!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 is fantastic thermal compound for the price.  And it IS non-conductive (although capacitive), so you don't need to worry too much.  I have had to repaste a few times, and still have plenty to use.<br /><br />If you are not fighting for a few °C, then this is the paste to get.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun I thought it was going to be boring but once you start to play it you become hooked trying hard to stay away from that cop and his dog, they even have daily challenges you can do, the best part about this game is the fact that you can compete with people you know on Facebook
B0002TT36G|4.0|The binder is nice. The only thing I don't like is the length. It hangs off the shelf and the length is unnecessary to hold the card pages.
B0034G4P1W|2.0|It will never beat Wallace and Grommet. Some hints are a bit adult for kids. But if you like idiocy you will like this.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|I heard The Neighbourhood on day and just loved there music so I preordered there cd which I never do. I waited a week for this cd but I finally got it yesterday and it has been on repeat ever since. Every song on this cd is great. Hope this band makes it big because I can't wait to see what else they come out with.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|It tries to be campy and comes out very entertaining and teaching a good lesson on loyalty and love and letting go and doing right.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|My daughter LOVES this book! It is one of the few that keeps her attention the whole time we read!
0783226837|4.0|It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I liked it.  It would have been five stars if the product matched the description a little better.  The shipping was prompt.  It arrived one day early.  I didn't have to contact customer service because the seller did a good job of handling my order.  The movie had bonus features that described how they made it.  I got parts 2 and 3.  It was worth the money.  It was cheaper then what you would find in stores.
B003I55BIA|2.0|I enjoyed  this  book. I thought it was sweet, and it was very..interesting...at best.<br />But I didn't enjoy the whole \\"perfect popular girl\\" with the \\"big bad gang boy\\" bit. It was extremely cliche and just predictable with the whole part in they fall in love and they change for the better and live happily ever after. Not only did I see it happening but I also hate the image it puts out. No girl, unless they are literally the luckiest person in the world, will receive an ending like this...it's nice to imagine but it  putting out a bad impression because it won't happen to everyone and possibly ANYone.<br /><br />One more thing....this would of gotten a higher star if it wasn't for the epilogue. I usually love epilogues and like reading them but that epilogue ruined it for me. Seriously. \\"Just because your parents cured Alzheimer's\\" really? Like I literally stopped reading after this. I've heard this book was amazing but now I'm rethinking that.<br /><br />Needless to say, I won't be reading the other books in the series.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Any easy and enjoyable read.  A topic that is of interest to most which was very well conveyed.  Kept my interest and loved the ending.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|And the sexual part of it was handled very tastefully, a beautiful story.  Helen Hunt was great, I can see why she was up for the award
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Love all of Frank Baums books.He was on of the first childrens book writers whom wrote books with life lessons instead of tring to scare the Bejesus out of kids, with monsters and things although the witch is pretty scary!
0812992792|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.. a historical-fiction type look at North Korea and the life of it's people.  It's scary and violent, and depressing and hopeful.  The story itself is riveting.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a great way to stay up to date with events almost as it is happening.<br />This site allows all opinions.
B008JH5CVS|2.0|What a cheesy pile of crap.  A waste of Guy Pearce, who I guess wanted to do something fun and brainless, but he's so much better than that.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Excellent movie. As I snowboarder, I have always wanted to view a movie like this. Excellent and speedy service as well. Thanx..
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  Easy to play, very easy to play.<br />A lot of fun and you can play easily.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|This movie was seemingly entertaining for then first 30 minutes, then it just needed to wrap up, get to the point and be over. Except it continues on for another 2 hours and practices EVERY movie cliche in the book! Don't waste your money
042527487X|5.0|This is my favorite book series the 4th book is worth the wait if you ask me. I love Gideon Cross he is a great book boyfriend. Eva is an amazing female lead she is strong and beautiful and damaged they make a fantastic &#34;real&#34; couple, with hurt, jealousy, love, steamy sex and even co-dependece. I recommend this book to anyone who is not looking for your normal everyday romance.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|if you've read the book, prepare to be disappointed with the film.  Depth of relationships between characters and their world is hardly explored in favor of almost exclusively focusing on the action.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I adore this app!!  It's so easy to change your melody to one solo sound, or switch it up with a few different sounds to find something that suits you.  It's very easy to use, with such a wide range of various sounds to choose from. Each sound can be tweaked too in regards to volume, so if you have two sounds on, and you want one to be louder than the other it's an easy fix!  I have the free version here, which does provide you with a lot of different sounds that's perfect for my needs, but I also have the full version on another device.  And the full version does come with tons of sounds to choose from!  Definitely one of the best apps out there for relaxation!!
B00BI73CVI|2.0|The singing was terrible. Almost like they lip synced it. An utter dissapointment.  Ann Hathaway did a terrible job as Fantine. Susan Boyle would of been a better Fantine. She certainly sings better.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|I thought the cover would have more padding and would unzip on thre sides<br />I was disappointed in the quality.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie...couldn't figure out why for the longest time, and then I realized...it's a Tim Burton Film!!!! That makes so much more sense!!! It is hilarious and witty and definitely a great choice!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|They are really relaxing an  the free one ha  alot of good sounds a especially the one that makes you fall asleep and the white noise work great i highly recomend it
B00C32REYI|5.0|My wife and I recently saw him in concert and he was amazing live!  So, I had to go buy all of his CDs!  This is my favorite CD!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of those books you just can't put down.I would tell every one to read it.Alex is the kind of man we all want to meet.
B0000630YA|4.0|ALICE COOPER-WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE: After eight albums as highly influential shock-rockers, the original ALICE COOPER band split up over the usual \\"creative differences\\", leaving frontman VINCENT FURNIER to assume the monicker; the dark, highly theatrical concept album WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE was the result. Despite the usual twisted and macabre fare, the biggest jolt was the atypical ballad ONLY WOMEN BLEED, whose poignant theme of battered females touched off a series of surprisingly mellow hits over the next few years. NIGHTMARE's atmospheric title track, the slick tongue in cheek anthem DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH and necrophiliac tribute COLD ETHYL proved closer to class-sick ALICE, with LOU REED guitarist DICK WAGNER, future KING CRIMSON bassist TONY LEVIN, DETROIT WHEELS drummer JOHNNY \\"BEE\\" BANDAJEK among the hired guns (VINCENT PRICE also makes a cameo). WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE may have lacked the hard rock muscle of earlier albums like SCHOOL'S OUT and BILLION DOLLAR BABIES, but it remains the provocative peak of ALICE's solo career, spawning a sequel several decades down the line.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR SHRIEKS
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie of real events. I can't even remember this rescue as it was drowned out by the larger hostage situation. I think that's the time when a new politics got started and the Dems ie Carter started to get blamed for everything.
B009PODB76|5.0|I'll keep this short!  Delta is an amazing artist and her voice will take you to another world!  'Child of the Universe' is her best album yet.  Very highly recommended!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|A bit overdone but it shows some of our very uncomfortable history in its true light. My wife walked away as she couldn't watch the cruelty of the day.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I never got to try this game as AVG antivirus say that this app has a virus. Hopefully this will be fixed.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I've tried a bunch of timer apps and this is the best by a country mile. It has every option you can think of. Look no further this is the MVP of timers.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This was great.  However they did make some minor changes.  At the end of Return of the Jedi, they changed the original Anikin Skywalker with the Prequel Anikin.  No biggy to me, but I'm sure some purest will be up in arms.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|It is far and away the best paranormal show of its kind to be shown on TV. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys high quality Si-fi.
B003QP4NPE|4.0|Great story. Couldn't put it down. Was always asking, do these technologies really exist? Highly recommended if you are into technology and its impact on society.
B00C4QWDYY|3.0|I wonder who teaches the male actors, the guy who plays the Shane character especially, how to do facial and head acting? My point: This guy Jon is pathetic with his dipping his head, cocking it to one side, his body postures - and no, this is not the character, but Jon's acting. Jon was so overwhelmingly melo-dramatic that I comsidered him a rookie given a chance at the big leagues. His silly acting got in the way of the story. Too many of the actors are too obvious in their stud acting. Superiors actors could have made the series worth the money spent. Superior actors, though, would not have participated. I suggest that one pay $1.00 per episode. No more than $1.00. But, be prepared for silly acting too often from Jon who plays Shane. The director created a silly and immature character in the boy, so much so that it is impossible to believe. Therefore, a primary character of the final several episodes are fluff. I say that about 50% of the episodes are worth watching, which is saying that the other episodes are fluff to make up some extra dollars. The fluff will make one laugh though. Again, each episode is worth $1.00 each, no more.
B00932A4XE|3.0|It was ok, glad I didn't go see it in the theater. It was funny and sad, and all the stories ended well, but just not 5 star worthy. Just so you know I would rate Avengers at 5 star, so we may have different views.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Not a huge Tom Cruse fan, but I do like a lot of the movies he's done. I've been a fan of the mission: impossible series since it aired on TV years ago. I liked it and it was part of Prime so it was free to view. Another added bonus to prime.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A great book that really keeps you enthralled all the way through and, more importantly, makes you proud to be an American, knowing there are guys like these guys out there doing what they do.
0062059963|5.0|Whew this was a super conflicting book for me- and in a good way.  I devoured this book in one sitting and am so happy about the route this book is going.America is not someone who will let others push her around and I appreciate that.<br /><br />Let me get this out of the way first- there are many people who are against this series and who find this series to be dystopian-lite and frivolous with all of the dresses and girly competition.  I suppose I should feel guilty for loving this series- but I don't.  At all.  I am ENJOYING the world that the author has created and am enjoying a book that isn't drowing in such a heavy and depressing dystopian storyline that I feel miserable reading it.  And ... I LIKE reading about fancy dresses.  I like reading about masquerades, balls, and afternoon teas.  I am so glad that others are able to make their opinions known and feel so strongly- that is fine with me, but I respectfully disagree- I love this series!  Is it the most profound series I have ever read? No.  But I find myself biting my nails, eagerly turning pages to find out what happens next.  The Selection and The Elite are similar to Downton Abbey and Once Upon a Time for me- they are soap operas that are drama filled and beautiful and keep me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />All that to say, the relationships in this book? I wanted to throw the book a few times!  Seriously.  AND I have decided to change teams- I am no longer on team Maxom.  He doesn't deserve America.  And America- whew did she make some mistakes in this book.  I loved the drama and all of the interactions between the characters.  The dialog was excellent and the pacing was absolutely perfect.  Sadly to say, the abuse that this book took from me was a little unfair- it really went through the ringer while I was reading it.  I absolutely can't wait for book three- I just hope I don't have to wait another year for it!
0670026603|5.0|Not my usual  book to read but caught my eye in a magazine book review. Glad I read it, very different, sometimes funny, sometimes made me cry. Contemporary material for our time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I've used Adobe reader for years on my laptop.  It is a &#34;Must Have&#34; program, so am glad to get it for my tablet.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Truly the defining film series of World War II. I remember many years ago watching the segments on Sunday night. A classic
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I use &#34;Explore&#34; all of the time on my laptop, so was glad to get it for my tablet.  This app is not as good as &#34;Explore&#34; on my laptop, but it is manageable and I do use it often.
1476734941|5.0|The book was in great condition as sent.  I book is easy to understand and I have already started the diet.  It is informative and helpful to me as an older adult.  Amazon did a great job with price and shipping.  Would buy again.  Have not been disappointed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best thing about Downton Abbey is quite possibly the superb casting. The addition of Shirley MacLaine as Cora's feisty American mother in season 3 has added a whole new entertaining element. I hope that Downton Abbey will continue for many seasons.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this alarm daily and love it! I believe that is enough said, but I need 3 more words.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It is wonderfully crafted, directed, and acted.  Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Fields, and Tommy Lee Jones are great.  A must see!
1250012570|5.0|So fresh, so nice, so beautifully written that it reminds you of all of things you experience while in love.  I cheered for Eleanor and Park and I feel renewed after reading this book.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany gives great performances in multiple roles.  'Orphan Black' does what great Sci-Fi should do -- it explores the social and human dimensions of the technological capabilities we acquire.  In this case (without giving too much away), the topic is genetic cloning and the psychology of possibly being one of those clones.  But the show layers on a richness, because each of Tatiana's 'sisters' has her own distinct personality and 'ticks and they find that even, if a bit reluctantly at first, they have to recognize and cooperate with each other (and with each others' extended familial and social networks) in order to get to the bottom of a mystery that holds the truth of their history, while simultaneously posing the greatest danger to their present and futures.  Watch the show -- and thrill to the story and acting!
B0012X6FR6|5.0|Love THIS trio and to hear a few \\"new\\" songs by them was incredible. As far as the product? Everything was as it should have been: came quickly, looked great, played beautiful. I wake to it.<br /><br />There is something I call \\"perfect enough.\\" Was the sound perfect? Nope. Was the trio perfect? Nope. Was this the perfect selection of songs? ... mmm Nope. Does Bill Evans reach down into the soles of his feet for soul and beautiful chords? Yes. Does La Farro catch every flake of Pixie Dust and surround each chord and run with sheer and utter wonderfulness? Why, yes ... he does! A better drummer would have had their own group. Perfect enough ...
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Beautiful music!  It is wonderful to have Carter Burwell back to finish the Twilight Saga for us.  Bella's Lullaby is once again woven into the melodies that support the story of Bella going from blushing bride to newborn Vampire.  It reaches beyond just the Twilight world and could easily appeal to any fan of instrumental music.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|I LOVE the Music and the story and I happen to think it is one of Streisand's best movies! I never get tired of it.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|This movie was recommended by a priest friend of a friend. The plot of conflicting groups, religous zellot Jews vs market malipitating \
B00683JLXA|3.0|The game is enjoyable but is a pretty blatant take on a more popular game. Even on my SIII it is difficult to play due to the small screen. On my tablet it was much more fun as it was easier to play and see what you are doing.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Very happy with the quality of the videos. I was a little nervous about ordering, but was very pleased thank you.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Got this CD at a concert in Nashville, saw these guys in the Mercy Lounge.  Man, what a show! Over 2 hours of solid performance.  I had never heard these guys before and went with a friend that said they were that good--and he was right.  The CD is very close to their performance, and all the tracks sound great.  The rocking tunes are Blues HMD, Still and Always Will, Nancy Lee, You Better Believe it, Jezzebella.  You will not be disappointed by this CD, it is live wire James Brown soul with some double-humbucker Les Paul mixed in.  Can't go wrong with this one--you'd have to be dead to not groove to this stuff!
B000000WHX|5.0|Massive Attack is by and far my favorite band, and I enjoy all types of music, not just of the trip-hop genre.  I only came across them 2 yrs ago by accident and have been addicted to them ever since.  My favorite album is Mezzanine but I don't have a favorite track, I pretty much love every song they have ever produced.  I've been listening to their Collected Album for the past year in my car and I'm still not sick of it.  Their music is simply undescribable and incredibly original.  Robert \\"3D\\" Del Naja's voice is sensational and can't be compared to anyone else.  Check out their track \\"inertia creeps\\" if you're not familiar and you'll understand what I'm talking about.  Also their collaborations with various vocalists are simply awesome and smart. Al though some songs may be considered \\"darker\\" than others, all of their music puts me in a great mood and helps me relax.  Their most recent album Heligoland is definitely much different then their prior albums (but then again all MA albums are different; why I love them so much), and it took a little while getting used to. But after listening to it for a bit I became addicted to that album as well.  The only album I don't have is Blue Lines, which I just purchased, al though I'm familiar with all the tracks on the album.  Bottom-line is Massive Attack is amazing and in my opinion so highly under-rated here in the states.  I recommmend any and all of their albums to anyone who enjoys refreshing, original music, and music that can't be categorized as falling into one particular genre, but rather an incredible blend of trip hop, alternative hip hop, experimental rock, down-tempo hip-hop, soul, reggae, even classical music.<br /><br />Ok so if you're not already familiar with MA, you're missing out, so introduce yourself to their music immediately; I guarantee you will not be dissapointed!
1616550414|5.0|Finally answers the fan-based speculation on so much.<br />And my children think that i am cool, at least for today
1484156005|5.0|Christoph Fischer's Sebastian is a very enjoyable read. I had already read something by this author, The Luck of the Weissensteiners, and really enjoyed that so when this one came out I was ready for it. It did not disappoint. Although the story follows a teenage boy into young adulthood it is not just his story, rather it is one of relationships and the transience of ones involvement in them, and all things. The backdrop of a Baltic war is never far from the forefront although this story line does not dwell in any battlefront scenes, which appealed to me. I thought it was clever how the author once again draws from history to create an illusive energy throughout the story, a tension that enters into Sebastian and his relationship with his mother, father, grandparents, romantic interests, and his jobs. The scenes were well written, the characters developed nicely, and the story charming, intriguing and poignant, holding my interest throughout the read. It's a good read for the entire family.
B0059DQHHI|5.0|The movie's main focus was love of family.  One man very idealistic and one very successful in the busness world.  What happens when tragedy strikes.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|If your not watching this you're either blind or dead because this is the best show ever its got dragons zombies giants weird midgets and a lot of other cool stuff.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A very well written sad story.  An insight into the horror that the Jewish people faced and one young girls effort to try and save her young brother.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This  game is relaxing and is a very great game and the game is a very great thing of a game and is very important to me
B008CLI4N4|3.0|The show of course is a 5 star entertainment fest.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />I bought it with my own cash money and I bought a this special to-the-consumer-market version, not some cheapass ex-Blockbuster straight-from-the-remainder-bins one.<br /><br />So why the **** am I looking at endless ****ing adverts for other HBO products when the first disk loads, and why can't I chapter-skip them?<br /><br />Die with bleeding lungs, vile marketing drones of HBO. Not enough I support you with my dollars, you have to piggyback commercials for your other tat at my expense. A tax audit on every last one of you useless wastes of skin. May  all your cars be lemons and may your houses blow down in a Hurricane. May fungus rot your lawns and top wilt take your trees.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|The book wasn't too bad but it wasn't THAT great. It took me a while to finish. I liked the part of the book where we Pi gets stranded, but I was kind of confused at the beginning of the book when Pi was talking about the Hindu gods and stuff.
0307279189|4.0|If you run alot this is a must read book for your library. McDougal has changed the way I stike forever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is a bit horse crazy &amp; loves this app.  After getting through the initial learning the game curve, she can generally navigate within the app without adult assistance.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Being involved in the film industry, and a big specialist in large format presentations, this is a great dvd for those fans of Baraka and Ron Fricke.  The cinescan from 65mm to 8k to 4k is fantastic and the best resolution and color I have ever seen on a video.<br />If one has a very large display, it will almost knock you out of your seat, in fact, one may wish to install seatbelts!
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Great twist on the Cinderella story that empowers young women to take control of their own lives. Super acting, clever dlalogue -- one of my favorite lines come from this movie -- Da Vinci saying, \\"I will go down in history as the man who opened a door.\\" I give copies of this to every family I know with young girls.
B000J670ZI|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore. Grant and Hepburn are hilarious in this<br />classic comedy. Highly recommended for anyone who has not seen it.
B003CI90MQ|5.0|I loved this book. Easy and practical tips. Gives easy tips to follow by &#34;type&#34; of shot. I will definitely continue to buy his books. Thinking of taking his online course.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is brilliant in every aspect: writing; acting; photography.  Enjoyable even for the non-Sherlockian, but if you have Baker Street Irregular propensities you'll have the additional fun of catching all the allusions to the canonical works.<br /><br />Cumberbatch could have been named Gumbybatch, he is so agile and fluid of movement, while Freeman provides the stolid, admiring Boswell/blogger for contrast.<br /><br />Worth it for Scandal in Belgravia alone. &#34;The woman,&#34; indeed.
B0027MJU00|4.0|If you're like me, your first introduction to Gillian Flynn was through reading GONE GIRL. And, if you're like me, you absolutely LOVED that novel, couldn't put it down, was extremely sad once it was over, and was desperately in need of more Gillian Flynn prose, STAT... that's how I ended up reading DARK PLACES. While I enjoyed GONE GIRL a lot more, I very much liked DARK PLACES. The protagonist is a hot mess and sort of hard to root for, but when you meet her mother and crazy half-sister, you'll find yourself becoming very sympathetic. Again, Flynn showed me that she is ridiculously awesome at shocking plot-twists - just when I found I had solved the mystery 100 pages before the end - I was proven wrong and it ended way differently than I thought it would! A great thriller with a touch of Southern Gothic-like overtones.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Worth owning because it takes more than two viewings to catch everything that's going on.  I may have a higher tolerance for repetition in my entertainment than most, but I find I can watch this periodically and enjoy it just as much, perhaps more, than the first time.  There's always some little detail here and there you've missed up to now.<br /><br />Kelly Macdonald, who is currently making up for her limited wardrobe in this film with the one that graces her in Boardwalk Empire, is delightful as a lady's maid turned sleuth.  Maggie Smith, as her mistress, sterling as always.  The late Alan Bates is the butler who oversees a manor house full of well known names for a weekend of pheasant shooting.  Bob Balaban is himself, in furs.  Gorgeous production values.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is something new that people are getting into will see how good it will be and how long it lasts.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Others that talked to are hooked on the show, can go back to when it all started this was a present.Great.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|I enjoy watching this dvd. Digital remaster makes viewing/listening experience a good time reminiscing the Eagles last tour. A keeper.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie in the theater, but have since enjoyed watching it many times at home.  A fun movie to watch.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Strangely written but beautiful and happy<br />Read before watching the movie. It will make it more genuine and believable. Read it while listening to Milford and Sons Babel CD- it fits it perfectly.
0783222149|5.0|Wasn't surprised to learn that Meryl actually did the water rafting...no stand ins.  She told her children to be sure and  remember that this was really her doing the water rafting.
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a very talented author.  My husband and I both read this novel and enjoyed it very much.  Can't wait for his 3rd one to be published.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|My husband and I started this, not to lose weight, but because he had pre-diabetic bloodwork. Regardless, he has lost 10 pounds in a month and me 5. I feel much, much better
1478978082|2.0|Having heard prior Harry Bosch audios - particularly with Len Cariou, I eagerly pre-ordered 'The Black Box'. It never occurred to me how important it was who was doing the reading. The latest reader is difficult at best to listen to. They are dull, drone-like sounding. Len Cariou from the Echo Park series was fantastic. Harry Bosch and others came alive.  I'll try to get thru it - but very disappointing to listen to. I would imagine there's a great story but I may have to give up before getting to the end.
0143122061|1.0|I bought this with a somewhat high expectation, having heard so much about Ferguson. Ferguson knows history no doubt but does not show a lot of intelligence in connecting the dots.<br />He cannot even structure the ideas in a MECE way. For example, he sees scientific discovery and medical advances as two completely different things (even someone untrained in science can tell that you cannot just separate the two and not even discuss if they are related).<br />Also, Ferguson avoids any serious empirical research. Surprisingly for an academic.<br /><br />Shortly after reading this, I got Why Nations Fail. It essentially goes on to say that everything Ferguson wrote is crap, and it does so in a well structured and strongly supported way. Read this book and forget about Ferguson's
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was good and I will recommend it to all my friends and family members and stuff three more words
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is a really fun and creative app. I play it all the time anywhere. but there are minor problems that might contain my device. Overall it is great!
B001M2CBRK|4.0|I liked the story and how it shows the life of a soldier in war and the pressure<br /> they go under. It shows soldiers dealing with insanity and falling into it from loneliness.<br />There was not enough action though and barely any combat scenes which bored me but i still enjoyed it.
0307949486|5.0|Great story, great suspense, well written. Bravo. I love thrillers and enjoyed the complex plot, the compelling characters, and the fantastic ending.
193413712X|3.0|This book reads more like some type of prose exercise than like a sensibly told story. I repeatedly dozed off while reading it, a rare occurrence for me.<br /><br />After digesting page after page of too-carefully-crafted images, I thought, \\"This author must have pursued a creative writing program and now feels obliged to write in an overly arty style.\\" Sure enough, the back cover reveals that he has an MFA from the Iowa Writers' Workshop.<br /><br />Even some of the back-cover reviews are written in that consciously over-literate style. That's no surprise, as it turns out that all three attributed quotes, plus the front-cover blurb, come from his writing teachers! What a cravenly incestuous business.<br /><br />Harding does write with skill, and he creates some interesting relationships and developments. If he used that skill to write in a more natural, less pretentious, less please-give-me-a-writing-award way, I imagine he could produce some excellent novels.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Highly recommended.  Great acting and story line about a crucial part of our history.  Really captured the torment and torture Lincoln went through.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I have always been a fan of the trilogy. This nice box set has the trilogy, the animatrix (haven't watched yet), along with an extras disc. I haven't seen the Animatrix but I have heard great things and look forward to watching it.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I have always been a fan this type. The little guy verse the big abusive government. If you enjoy this you will enjoy both versions of Red Dawn.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the Indiana Jones series, so of course I enjoyed the blurays. I like blurays because of the flexibility they provide that DVDs don't -- language options, very lax regional codes. The only issue I have with blurays is playing on a PC which can be costly to keep up-to-date with the latest bluray software.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such a great book! Loved this one and the second one. Cannot wait for the third. Keeps you on edge the whole time. Such a great love story!
0345529057|1.0|After reading some in the first book, I wondered why this had not been rated as soft porn.  I was disgusted and sent it back.  George Martin has writing ability, but the walk in the sewer did not sit  well with me.
B0049J5EWW|4.0|My kid watched it for about 20 minutes, which is great, but I wanted to finish watching it and he wouldn't let me.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This is a classic!  I am replacing my old VHS tapes with DVDs and this is the way to do it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|An outstanding story that kept my interest till the very end.  It was written with deep insight and I would highly recommend it.
1878424505|5.0|I teach in my community and online, and I build communities of people who come together for personal and spiritual exploration and growth and development. When I gather a community together, I always start with this book as the foundation for how we are going to be with each other and in the world. I have a friend and colleague who does the same, and the results are amazing. Conflicts get resolved, people take responsibility for their own thoughts and feelings, and relationships are able to be elevated to new levels. I gave this book to my college-aged daughter, and she read it in a day and then passed it on to her friends. It is four very simple yet profound principles which will change the way you see, think about, and do everything. And the transformation from within that will show up in your outer world will be life-changing and amazing. It really is that powerful of a book.
0385535147|4.0|I've read most of Grisham's fiction, and always find it enthralling.  His character descriptions are vivid enough for me to really \\"see\\" the characters.  This novel was no exception.  The plot was intriguing, but the conclusion seemed a bit \\"rushed\\".  Everything seemed to be explained rather quickly at the end, but some more explanation of how everyone was tied in would have been appropriate.
B003297I1U|5.0|The crane is awesome, my son is playing with that crane all the time. Great German quality. Worth every dollar spent.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Juliana Margolies is fantastic as Alicia Floorick and the rest of the cast are excellent as well. The  episodes are so adictive, I have to drag myself away.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing game!!!!!!! It was definitely with the 6.99!!!!!!! I love this game so much!!! It is so cool
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it can't wait for next season!! Love love love love love now this better be enough words. GEEZE make people use a certain amount of words seems a little pushy!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I've read the entire trilogy.  I enjoyed them all, but can't honestly say I would rank them in the top books I have read.  I have many books I have or would gladly re-read.  This isn't one of them
B000SEIK2S|5.0|John Scalzi tells a story here that is kept interesting through out the whole book. His caricatures are very well written. One of the few books I've read several times and will read again.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Unforgettable characters that remind us that each person carries a story inside and a deep need to feel loved.  The descriptions of events and places brought smiles, winces and strong connections to the reader.  Thank you, Christina, for an unforgettable story.

1610390938|5.0|This textbook (I am taking the authors' M.I.T. course) is possibly the very best of its kind. There is almost no demand for, and therefore little supply for, quality research on the causes of poverty and its cures. The book presents experiments largely conducted by the authors themselves. They are not brilliant in the manner of Adam Smith or Karl Marx. They are merely scientific, merely openminded, always deferring to carefully gathered evidence; and that makes \\"Poor Economics\\" almost unique in its field.<br /><br />It seems everybody has a theory on how poverty works and how to end it; and everybody else doesn't care. But everybody is wrong. No one bothers to experiment because we think we already know that the poor are not like us, that they fail to cope in worlds not so different from ours. Over and over, the authors' rigorously constructed experiments find that poor people do think and choose very like the rest of us, but in circumstances that any of us would find intractable.<br /><br />Over and over, they find that panaceas like microfinance, elections, property rights, education, and birth control cannot by themselves dig whole societies out of holes that are deeper and steeper than we can quite imagine. Corruption, in particular, is hard to fight locally when it is organized nationally. And yet the authors also show that there are many strategies and interventions that can -- slightly -- alleviate poverty, and many ways that poor people manage at least slightly to better their family prospects.<br /><br />This intellectually humble book makes few claims except to its own diligence in finding out truths about the most difficult lives on our planet. They cannot end poverty right away, but perhaps they can put an end to much of the charlatanry that surrounds this complex and almost impenetrable problem.
0062124293|5.0|Three word synopsis:<br /><br />Hysterical, Intelligent, Contentious.<br /><br />Here's the deal: I really enjoyed this book. The entire first half had me in stitches....<br /><br />Read the rest of this review here:<br /><br />[...]
B002BWP49C|5.0|As everyone else who is a fan this was the event we all waited for the Wedding and the birth of Bella's & Edward's child, it was great.  I loved the way they progressed Bella's character during her pregnancy and all of the heartache Edward had to endure since Bella refused to terminate the pregnancy.  I did tell my family and friends to go see it if they hadn't already because they would not be disappointed.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|i know, i know, my gran always warned me that expectations inspired disappointment and great expectations, crippling disappointment; well, i had expectations for this flick -- i was disappointed.  it just didn't have \\"IT\\"; whatever that is (can't deifne it) -- just felt this flick didn't have it.<br />one does not expect the acting to be 'oscar worthy' from these flicks; it wasn't.  one does expect to be awed by the 'spectacle' of the epic story; i wasn't.  this was just a re-hash of the 'fellowship of the ring' with dwarves instead of a mixed bag of middle-earthlings.  scenes of chases, orcs, caves:  same old, same old; nothing new, here.  to have the flick end on a view of the great mountain of smaug was S U C H a let-down; why did i sit through this endless tramping through middle earth?  i'm wodering if i shall watch the second installment; i may not.  i think i'll go and read the book, again; that is NEVER disappointing.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I was very pleased with this movie, I loved all of the special effects and make-up.  I was captivated by all of the characters and the scenery, how the humans were changed into their Avatar bodies.  I recommended everyone see it.

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great movie -- thinking they should have done this one first and its a real bummer we gotta wait til December this year to see only the second part of this movie-- dont know if i wanna wait another year to see the third part
B002A9VJ40|5.0|If you saw Officer an a gentleman and liked it you will liked this. It is just more involved with all the actors  making it a great movie.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|I found this book a good read and an excellent background to the dealings that went on behind the scenes politically seen from the viewpoints of different economic classes. It was quite long like most of Follett's books and I wished I had read the first book in the trilogy beforehand as he introduces many of the characters in the earlier volume. I found it confusing at times to keep up with the different families as they lived through this period in their various ways. I would recommend reading Fall of Giants first.
B0092SQBJA|5.0|I really enjoyed their first album, so I was worried that this one might not be as wonderful.  But my worries were unfounded, I love this album just as much as the first!
1451668945|5.0|I have read all her books and this one is just as good as the others. Of course, some I enjoy a little bit more but I always re-read them because the mystery is wonderful, there is no horrible violence and no sexual overtures. And she manages to disentangle the mystery in a beautiful way.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd works with hard work and eating right. Cutting out sugary and salty foods and drinking lots of water. Jillian pushes you to do what you didnt think you could!

B00005JLSE|5.0|I had seen the orginal stage play plus the movie.  The movie was not quite as good as the broadway cast version as they had to compensate for Richard Geer's lat of talent and left some numbers out and put new ones in but the ladies were fantastic.

B00422LESO|4.0|The only other Shannon Hale book I have read is Goose Girl and the style of writing was completely different.  This book is lighter on description and character development, but replete with humor, indecision and romance.  Saying that, I wanted to care more about the character, and it is not as if I didn't at all, just not as much as I would have liked. This was a light, quick read. The author is very funny. I'm assuming that anyone picking this up is already a fan of Jane Austen 's works, but if not, you might want to brush up on some of those, not only to understand the plotline, but also because you will miss some humorous references involving those characters and situations.  Overall, an amusing and inventive story that was interesting enough to make me want to read Midnight in Austenland.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its fun and has cool charectors to upgrade to. I think Scarlett Fox is amazing.Its awesome to play and it rocks
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game and play it often.  Best game that i have on the Kindle.  I like that it gets more challenging as you complete the levels..
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm absolutely amazed with the performance of this car charger, I've used dual chargers in the past and my devices wouldn't really charge if I was using it or it would take a long time, however, with this charger I was delighted to see how quickly it charged my devices.  I've tried different devices in both ports and it charges them amazingly fast!!!  LOVE LOVE this charger!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an excellent series. While the story, overall, was great, it does get a little wordy in some areas. Not terrible but I did find myself reading faster through those parts. Get the omnibus. You won't be disappointed!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family and I love this game, including my 8 year old and grandma. It's reminds me of Monopoly and Risk, but not as long and you're not as likely to make enemies, if you know what I mean.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I love feeling immersed in a good story - this movie definitely does that! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a flick to watch on a weekend night.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|It was a real page turner.I could not leave the book down.I like the way he puts in lots of twists.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been on the &#34;Fast Diet&#34; for about 5 weeks.  I have lost 16 lbs without a lot of effort.  I feel like I can keep this up to lose weight and reach my goal.  One thing is the testimonials in the book almost all say after a few weeks on the diet the fast days are easier to do.  I still have a hard time with those days and feel hungry, however, I can stick it out, knowing the next day I can eat what I want.  I do find that I don't overeat on the non fast days and sometimes eat less than usual.  I am also exercising 3 days a week at Curves, so that helps.  My fast days are Mondays and Thursdays, however, if I know I am going to dinner or if there is a special occasion on one of those days, I just switch the &#34;fasting&#34; to another day.  It works for me!  I did ask my doctor about this diet and she is all for it.  She was very happy I had lost weight and sees no reason I can't continue.  I tell a lot of people about it, but mostly they say they could never do the fasting(500 calories) for even 1 day.  If you don't have any medical problems such as diabetes, it should be safe.  If you are worried ask your doctor.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I cannot wait for the album. One reason why I bought this song earlier then album release date. Definitely more rhythm than anything I've heard in a while. Reminds me of JT's latest album.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|If you are a batman family fan this is defiantly a good book, it's so exciting to turn the next page and see what happens
0071762345|5.0|I thought this book was great. It's an easy ready with a ton of great examples from real companies and brands you can research online. As someone who has been working with social media marketing for years, a lot of the topics were things I already knew about, but it was still very insightful and a great reminder.<br /><br />For those who are just starting with social media, then you need to read this book! You will gain a lot from it, and be able to take the examples Dave uses and translate them to your own business.<br /><br />Overall, a great, informative book that those in the business should read regardless of how much of an \\"expert\\" you are. It will either be a good brush-up for you, or you will learn new things!
B000JO9JHW|4.0|Read the books and was surprised that the series compared so well.  They made some changes and while I usually don't like that, this time I actually think some of them were for the better.
B008UTV43K|4.0|I saw Diana last night in concert with her Glad Rag Doll tour. I wasn't sure what to expect. I have seen her before many years ago and her sound is truly amazing. I bought every album she came out with including where she wrote all her own music. That one I was disappointed in, so I didn't keep buying anymore. I guess I wanted something new from her. I got it in Glad Rag Doll. The concert I saw was AWESOME! She is as I always thought a very talented woman. The other reviewers are right, this is something different but she pulls it off. Go see her live on this tour if you can and you will see how it all works together and why she put this album out. I loved every song she sang. Is it jazz? Yes & no, but who cares it's great music!
B0052SF6CM|5.0|The CD came as it is described, brand new and blah blah blah, I bought it for my girlfriend as a gift because she like Calvin Harris a lot, she loved it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Android phones lock up all the time and have been extremely disappointing. If it weren't for Advanced Task Killer, my phone would stay frozen and unusable.
0785162348|4.0|NICE  BOOK  LOTS  OF  GREAT  PICTURES  LOTS  OF  INTRESTING  FACTS  OF  CHARACTERS  BIOS  ALSO  INFORMATION  ABOUT  ALL  THE  WEAPONS  BUILDINGS VEHICLES  AND  SUCH**  FUN  READING ** THE  ONLY  THING  I  DONT  LIKE  ARE  THE  PICTURES  WHICH  TAKE  UP  TWO  PAGES  THE CENTER  CREASE  MAKES  IT  HARD  TO  SEE  ALL  THE  DETAILS  THEY  SHOULD  HAVE  MADE  FOLDOUT  PAGES  WELL  WORTH  THE  MONEY  A  MUST  BUY  FOR  ANY  MARVEL  OR  AVENGERS  FAN
1476733953|5.0|Bought this book because if really high ratings on Amazon.<br /><br />The book completely exceeded by already high expectations. Innovative, relatable characters and an intense story.
B009MXSWI8|5.0|What can I say ? This movie has some terrible special effects but they are so gross they're fun to watch. The woods scene . . . You have to see it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|You've have no idea how nice it is to see a game that treats everyone the same no matter what the format.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Pretty graphic and over kill in the blood and guts theme. If you like movies with extreme blood this is it
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. My 15 yr old daughter felt the same way & loved the book. Reading the next one!
B0095P3ULC|5.0|I absolutely love the transformer movies!  Plots! Smots!  It is just good action and fun!!  I recommend all 3 movies and I can't wait for 4!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This salon game is the best! Nothing else can beat it!!! I highly recommend it no matter who you are. I play this EVERY DAY WITHOUT DELAY!!!! (Oh hey that rhymes!) If you are 100 years old you would like this! So GET IT NOOOOOOOW!!!!!!! :3
B008602KQI|3.0|It didn't live up to expectations.  It wasn't very creative but a retake of an old story.  Hunger Games would make a decent TVseries but it wasn't up to movie standards.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's really fun but Don't buy for your kindle fire he won't repeat the things you say, because they have no Mic.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|just totally awesome! wish the series didnt end...... read them all in a weekend! cant wait for the movies now!
B009MFKO3M|4.0|Reminds me a lot of The Flaming Lips.  The album is good for a breakthrough, but the band has room to grow and improve.  Some of the deeper cuts are not as excellent as their airplay hits.
B000001FN3|5.0|This was my first experience with APP  (they actually played Dr.Tarr on AM back in the day)  tremendous overtures for a rock album one of my all time favorites I can listen to this over and over again! The lyrics on Cask of amontillado are haunting.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Its interesting to see how the band has evolved.  Great stuff.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Great game so far haven't finished it yet<br />Great graphics and hidden item scenes<br />Great story line<br />Can't wait for the sequel
B00BRR66SA|1.0|This album sucks... I downloaded the hole album before reading any reviews or listening to any of his songs thinking it would be just as good as his last album, but this one is awful... Not the JT we are use to... I want my money back!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Such a horrific story of torture and deprivation in the North Korean prison camps.  While Shin was eventually able to physically escape the hell of Camp 14, he's still struggling to emotionally escape the horrors of what he has seen and lived through.  I hope Shin finds peace, direction, and happiness in his life.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It's s very cool game. I wish there were more survival games out like this. If there were, I'd play them
143353083X|4.0|There is nothing wrong with this &#34;personal size&#34; but because it is a study bible and has extensive notes which were size 8 font, I returned to purchase a study bible with large print.  the price difference is huge but i am hoping the experience will be also.  because it is paperback, the pages were quite thin (delicate).
B009VSW15Y|1.0|It would be just wonderful if you could provide some basic instructions concerning the use and functions of this app. I understand my MBA was obtained<br />30+ years ago but a little help goes a long way.
1401235425|5.0|I've just gotten into graphic novels over the past few years (Long Halloween, Killing Joke, Identity Crisis, Frank Miller, Hush), but this story blew me away. The artwork is absolutely stunning and the story kept me interested all the way through (I couldn't help but read it in one sitting). I read Volume 2, The City of Owls shortly after, and I can't wait to continue reading them all. Can't stress enough how enjoyable this was.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was awesome I never would have thought that it would be this good I mean that was amazing
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It was a very enjoyable movie, one I could watch with my grandchildren.  We all enjoyed it. I would tell people to watch it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Provides non-sensical fun after work to relax by, lol.  Every one should try this game with family and friends, etc.
1401324649|4.0|The tale of a centenarian on a crazy adventure involving a hotpot of different characters (an elephant?!), and the imaginative demise of some very unfortunate people along the way. Lighthearted (if a story about an apolitical explosives expert in some seriously political predicaments can be described as such) and ridiculous, but a must-read. I had to put it down for a few deep breaths between chapters.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love diamond dash it is a very addicting game. I share my scores on Facebook it hopes that more of my friends give it a try. I love this game! :)
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Very good guy flick.  Great unexpected suspense. You will enjoy this if you like movie that don't give away threading.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This is one of my favorites, along with [[ASIN:B00C4QSABO Manifesting The Secret: The Seven Highly Effective Words for Applying Law of Attraction (Law of Attraction Series)]] for applying law of attraction. I have the DVD also that we watch every day. But the book has so much more than the DVD. Highly recommend if you are interested in using Law of Attraction to improve your life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like that we jump up on trains and go threw tunnels. And the hacker boards are really something . I play it every day lol.
030745455X|5.0|I had bought this book for a friend of mine who was very interested in reading this series. He thoroughly enjoyed them both.
0307742539|5.0|I bought these books for a friend of mine and they thoroughly enjoyed reading them. He says they kept him entertained as well as intrigued by the whole story.
B000LW7LOU|5.0|As always, Daniel Day Lewis was magnificent in his role, and he was perfect for the story, making it very believable. The film, though tragic, was very true to the novel
B004SIP7TE|2.0|I love  Daniel Day Lewis, but I did not enjoy this movie because of the violence. I did not feel that Leo DiCaprio was the right man for his part....can't see him as part of a gang....he does not come across as a tough gang member.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game I can't stop playing I feel like a kid lol. The more I play the more I fall in love
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard a lot about this since season one. I decided to try it out by buying a few episodes. I got hooked.  Fun program plus I enjoy the history. Have not enjoyed a serial this much since Dallas.
B006C67NP6|3.0|I don't spend most of my time trying to read chords from an Android device. I don't use a tablet, only a smartphone, so the chords appear too small for my eyes. I practice in front of a large screen with speakers at my desktop (I use a laptop with monitor and keyboard plugged in.) There is no accommodation for desktop use, so this does not work well for me.<br />Also, there should be a way to upload that does not look like a blog. In order to download chords and music, I have to look for someone's conversation, and incidentally there's some music there. Not a logical format. Create a distinct music upload section.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You get hooked on this story. Outstanding production and I am not a TV watcher. Highly recommended. Watching it in close sequence is fun.
B000V6ADNW|5.0|One of most anticipated albums ever, 50 fulfilled every expectation with an instant classic. My favorite song in there \\"patiently waiting\\".
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm really enjoying the story so far. Totally unbelievable though that they would allow Tom Barrow to stay. Gays were feared at that time. I love the little romance between Bates and Anna.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works great for what I was looking for.  I did not check out others so I can't compare
B007MOU6ZQ|5.0|One of the best self-help books I've read, and I've probably read most of them. It's a great book on alternative, and possibly more readily achievable, approaches to happiness. Best of all it's written with exceptional wit and humour whilst discussing very serious issues. I nearly died laughing when I read the experiences of the author in a meditation retreat. I'd recommend this book to anyone who would like to be happy.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|THIS BOOK IS THE BEST!!!!! The fastest book I've read on this KINDLE!! It had such a twist at the end and the magnificent description and the drama was just amazing!! I LOVE IT!! My favorite book of all time!!
B0000042GM|3.0|I hadn't heard of Julius Katchen before, but reading the other reviews convinced me to get these disks.  I agree:  Katchen's playing is marvelous.  Often, I get the impression that he's playing the pieces very much as Brahms himself would--it's as if Brahms is playing for us.  I would prefer a bit more rubato in some places, but this is a minor nitpick.<br /><br />This set would have been 5 stars for me had there not been the constant tape hiss.  In some recordings, such hiss is not that big a deal, but Brahms's dynamic range is so large that very often the soft notes come close to disappearing into the hiss.  That's really unfortunate.  Without the hiss, these recordings would be my definitive version of these works.  But, given the hiss, my quest for a favorite Brahms set I can live with forever continues.
B0015AARJI|5.0|exactly  as advertised  has  a  few  scratches  but  they  are  so  small  i  didn't  even  notice  them  at  first  works  great!
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This is one move that you hate and like at the same time. It's so good you want to watch it again and at the same time it's so disturbing that you don't wanna watch it again.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|It's a great movie and definitely fun to watch.  Adults can appreciate the humor in this movie.  It is graphically stimulating and I wouldn't mind watching it over.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very fun game! My husband and I both enjoy building the park, taking care of the dinosaurs and redesigning the layout. On top of that our son loves watching the dinosaurs and we can use them to educate him and get him curious about them!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This story was such a nice surprise! Easy, quick read. I highly recommend having the tissue box on hand though!
B004MKLRQA|5.0|My son really enjoyed reading this book. It was an eye-opener to read that a boy my son's age had to endure such a horrible life changing experience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like seasons 1 and 2, this third installment is addictive. Though some of the plot lines come off as contrived and a bit too convenient, it is still a most watchable series. They are also quite liberal in killing off major characters. So, don't get too attached to them! The downstairs characters can often be more interesting than the upstairs characters. Maggie Smith is still one of the best things about the series and steals every scene that she is in. This just proves that some people get even better with age!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have never been so touched by a book.  I have experienced such strong emotions.  This is so much more than a love story.  I laughed, cried and cried some more.  Don't miss this magnificent story.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|David Mitchell is a very talented author and I appreciate his views on individual worth. Will read his other books
0802130208|5.0|book in great used condition, the main character of this book is a real piece of work. haha. in retrospect, this is one of the funniest books i've read. there are so many hilarious quotes to take from it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Pretty typical Tarantino work.  Lots of bang, blood, and foolish song with a dose of humor tossed in for good measure.  It kept my attention but I don't need to see it again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is one of the funniest people alive. Witty, self-deprecating and generally a hoot. She's made me laugh out loud many times as I read this book.
B0096HL33G|2.0|This was DULL.  Weak story line and lifeless acting by a cast bent on putting the viewers to sleep. It took me about 30 minutes to doze off..................
B005LN5UOC|5.0|I CHOOSE THIS RATING BECAUSE ITS AN GOOD HEADSET.<br />YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THOSE OTHER HEADPHONE. THINK ABOUT IT.. THE DO THE SAME THING.. LET YOU TALK ONLINE TO PEOPLE.. BUT YOU GET THIS AT A BETTER PRICE.. OPEN YOUR MINDS PEOPLE!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I couldn't put the book down. I was hooked and then it just ended. I was  extremely disappointed although the book was very well written and well conceived-very clever.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I had not watched it when it ran on PBS years ago so I could not compare it to the previous programming. Not to worry, it stands alone just fine. I hope there will be more of it.
B009LDD590|5.0|One of the best tv shows in a decade!  writing is very good but what steals the show is the authenticity.  a fortune in time period accurate costumes and painstaking detail.  on par with Titanic for authentic parts, cars, a nyc subway train - absolutely visually impressive and accurate!  Wish i could give it 6 stars!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Thought provoking. Visually stunning. An enjoyable movie. Definitely deserved the academy award win. Will see again. Good time for all
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read other accounts of NDE's (near death experiences) and have found them to be a way for the author to put forth his/her own personal beliefs.  This is different.  This is written by a neurosurgeon who is objective, personal, and presents an intelligent expression of his experiences.  He does not try to convince  you of any belief system.  If you are going to read only one of this type of experience, this is the one that you want to read.
B0002BO05S|5.0|I love this movie and every year like to watch all the Easter Stories.  I like to learn about the apostles, and their time with Jesus.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|Really liked the sound of this app. However, it would not work on my tablet. Please fix and I'll try it again.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I loved the first season of American Horror Story and Asylum brings back the horror with a whole new storyline and a mostly new cast of characters.<br /><br />I do not want to spoil anything about this show but it is one of my new favorites.
0062059963|4.0|I flew through this one and enjoyed getting to see another side of all of the characters. This one did a much better job at elaborating on the other girls, and I really enjoyed that. I know it was impossible in the first because getting to know America, Maxon and Aspen, and of course, there were just TOO many other girl.<br />  Oh, America. She still needs time. I don't know why I am surprised by this because it is only the second book in the series, and of course she hasn't made a decision. I just feel for her heart as well as Maxon and Aspen, because someone is going to get hurt.<br />  I enjoyed getting to know Marlee more, and interested at her reasoning for why she doesn't think she and Maxon are a good match. I, of course, have some speculations, but wanted more events to unfold. Besides, I just like her and America's friendship. It is refreshing to read about with all of the politics and love triangle afoot. Not saying that I don't like the romance, and getting deeper into that, I just like that aspect as well.<br />  But oh, at the event that the synopsis hints at with the devastating loss--oh my goodness. I couldn't believe it and wished that there was something I could do to change it. It made me want to cry and scream.<br />  And while I can understand America questioning herself and what she thought was her choice, I just wanted to strangle her because she wasn't looking at the whole picture.<br />  I was so mad at her at times, because while I understood needing to get her feelings straightened out, and I am usually all for the forbidden love, I just didn't want for anyone to get hurt. And she was playing with huge fire still having feelings with Aspen, and the risks that they took in Selection alone were enough to be charged with treason according to the rules.<br />  I couldn't look away from the book though, and my heart was torn just like hers with each twist and thing that happens, but I know that I am rooting for Maxon overall, and I think that America could do great things with him for the nation.<br />  I am so ready for the next book in the series, and it is almost sad that I got the arc because now I have to wait longer... But I was immersed in this story and counting down until I can read more.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Emotional second book where America's choices only get harder.erica could do great things with him for the nation.<br />  I am so ready for the next book in the series, and it is almost sad that I got the arc because now I have to wait longer...

0061438294|5.0|I thought this book was a great read.<br /><br />I liked the author's writing style. It felt like he was speaking to me. It was easy to follow and not unnecessarily wordy.<br /><br />I liked all of the anecdotes because they kept me interested. Some books start off great and then get tedious but this one kept me interested all the way through.<br /><br />The pictures did a great job of illustrating what the author was trying to explain. I felt they were essential to getting the points across and am glad that that many were included.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fact that the author himself was posing in many of the pictures. It just seemed down-to-earth and not pretentious. He didn't take himself so seriously that he had to hire models. He just got himself and a friend to model the poses. It made me feel like the author was genuine and I could trust things he was saying.<br /><br />To me, the sections on facial expressions didn't teach me much new, but the parts about legs and feet and the body language of the torso was very eye-opening.<br /><br />I'm definitely glad I read the book. I thought it was practical advice. I'll hang onto it and try to practice when I go to events where I can do some people-watching.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|easy to download. cheap price. not (in my opinion) his best work.  Maybe just feeling this new style.  may be better off downloading the single you like.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hard to stop watching.  I stay up too late at night watching.  My wife is also stuck on it but that gives us time to be together after a long day at work.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My grandchildren love the Panda apps. I've downloaded every one of them. Fun times and educational too. I recommend it for all ages.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|So Amazon are you actually going to post my review this time? If so here goes! The story is very gripping and always leaves you wanting more! Wish I did not have to wait a week for the next one LOL! As far as the quality of this video on Amazon goes it is extremly clear, and no stupid ratings blocking the actual video. Definately DVD quality! Even if you are not a fan of comics or Green Arrow in general this show is very good and at a good price on Amazon. So give this a shot, it is very worth watching!
B007FLHW3K|5.0|Wear your MonkeyLights with pride!  We ride our semi-recumbant, tandem bicycle and tow a dinghy behind us throughout the summer (back and forth between our home and the dinghy dock).  Many times by the time we are back on the mooring and on the hard it is dusk or later.  Between our headlights, taillights and three MonkeyLights (one on front tire of tandem and two on the dinghy trailer tires) we are a sight to see.  For sure we are seen on the road and wherever we go we get into lots of great conversations over the MonkeyLights (okay, about towing the boat too).  The MonkeyLights also came in handy when we rode in the Tour la Nuit in Montreal.
B004YD1KTO|5.0|Its a good story - written from a different point of view. Its finding the 'who did it' but in a different way. I liked it
034580404X|1.0|Quite possibly one of the worst books I've read, since Stephanie Meyer decided to poison the world with her filth.<br /><br />Terrible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I rate this app high  because I do get bored easily and it has a lot to entertain me with.
B00881PTRC|3.0|It was the FAOTD about a week or so ago... one of the better hangman games I have played but not all that great. I like the different themes but the basic game play just became boring after a while. IMO a great little game as a time filler if your waiting somewhere but no real long term playability. Will most likely uninstall because I haven really played it since installing on my Note 2. I think this game will be great for kids...young kids. But the adult \\"wow\\" factor is just not there.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I fix computers.  I can easily put my 17&#34; laptop into the sleeve that was created for a laptop.  Every compartment has plenty of space to put a large amount of equipment into.  And each zippered compartment doesn't infringe upon the other.  I can fit my laptop, Seagate 4tb hard drive, my external netgear wifi expanders, wallet, all sorts of little stuff with the rather crafty top compartment on the very top of the bag.  Also, it's a very sturdy bag.  I've filled it up totally to the max with gear several times and not a single rip or tear.  It's a tough bag for what I use it for.<br /><br />PROS:  Very sturdy, won't break down, plenty of space for everything that you can think of.<br /><br />CONS: The main compartment zipper likes to not work properly from time to time.  But if you know how to fix it, you'll have no problems.<br /><br />Best backpack on Amazon!!
B000OJFV4C|3.0|I understand that the world of Henry VIII was full of promiscuity but there are far better fictionalized historical pieces (see anything by Philippa Braithwaite) than this.  The acting is good; the story lines are interesting but I'm not sure if the focus is more on making King Henry seem like a sex starved young buck than the ambitious powerhouse that he was.  He seems to have very little conscience and despite all of his wives, tyranny, etc., he apparently did struggle with his own morality - to the point that he created a church!  No shred of any moral conflict in this episode anyway.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is a simple but useful one at that. I love using this app for my algebra problems awesome
B00969PR18|4.0|Its very helpful when you are looking for an adress that its complicated it take you rigth to the correct place
0385363125|3.0|It is a good book but expected more from the series. He bought the books to collect them but this might not be in my collection, tastes are different between people, just an opinion.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great fun even annoying it's good to waste a few mins and my 3yo enjoys of to even if he's just crashes :)
B0064MPXFA|4.0|pretty decent show in my opinion.  nice mix of characters.  it is certainly indicative of Chicago politics. a lot of twists at times.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|it is just awesome I cant even discribe how awesome it is its fun to play with other poeple trim around the world
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie has it's funny parts, but is up and down throughout the movie making it almost boring at times.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|If you are interested in making the world around you a better place, as I am, this book is for you.  I wish more middle managers and business owners would practice the ideas in this book. It would truly change the quality of work life in our country (USA).
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin never fails to deliver amazing story telling<br />The books keep getting better and I love them mote and more
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is an unusual 15 year old. He cannot bear the color yellow and believes the number of red cars he sees on the bus ride to school will determine the mood of his day. Aside from having savant's syndrome, Christopher is autistic. Besides all of this, he lives a normal life. He lives with his father in a house, rides the bus to school, and takes care of his rat, Toby.<br /> In the United Kingdom bestseller, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, Christopher, along with Toby, go on a quest to find who killed the neighbor's dog after being falsely accused of the murder. Our young protagonist has to go out of his comfort zone by talking to strangers and having to understand how \\"normal\\" people think. Another mystery soon comes around when Christopher uncovers new information about his dead mother.<br /> Mark Haddon gives a unique insight of the mind of those who have endured with being judged for something they cannot control. Christopher is a unique character. Readers get to see what goes on inside the resourceful mind of Christopher John Francis Boone. The reader feels as if they are on the journey with Christopher. Christopher's awareness is astounding and he gives it all to us in detail.<br /> Though the book was written for adults, it is a great read for teenagers and young adults. The theme applies to everyone in our world. The story teaches trust and tolerance, two things Christopher has a hard time with. The themes had an impact on the way I think about others and how those with autism are not that different from the rest of us.<br /> Christopher breaks out of his shell. And if he's brave, he can do anything.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I would reccomend this app to everyone.  You can find a lot of great ideas easy and economical to do.
B00005O3VC|3.0|What was exspected, seemed maybe some scenes were short. I liked the extras, returning to the places where the film was shot.
B00AGKH6D8|3.0|good playing but the songs are a little to loose and jammy---kind of repeats itself---probably a little more time and effort on the production end could have  turned these sessions into something inspiring
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really fell in love with the characters!  It was so easy to get lost in this story and many times I found myself not wanting to put it down.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun way to learn about reef in general gameplay fun and addictive. Great graphics just watch the in game purchases and all is good.
B0056A9WF8|4.0|I've gone on an Ira Levin kick- after watching and reading &#34;Rosemary's Baby&#34;, I figured I'd try this one. It was pretty clever, I will say- for a woman under 30, the idea is just part of our cultural lexicon. I don't think it's original classification as horror really applies, and the message of the book is too familiar to me to be shocking or even particularly thought provoking. But I would consider this a perfect beach read- finished it in only a few hours. There's no controversy left in this idea for me, but Levin's original renders the story far better than any of its occasionally embarrasing film interpretations. I was more than a little disappointed, though, that the book was so short! There were quite a few unanswered questions for me, and a lot of foregone character development that I would have found enjoyable. On the other hand, maybe if Levin had gone into too much depth, it would have lost something else. It may have proved hard to suspend disbelief over any more pages. As is, it's incisive, punchy, and over too soon.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|As someone who enjoyed playing in the tournaments on Facebook, it is nice to see this game on this platform. The game consists of the Tournament portion of the Facebook app only, but it is nice to have at my fingertips, instead of a mouse. Let's be honest, Angry Birds is meant to be played with a touch screen.
B003BKZW7C|4.0|I loved the 1991 miniseries, which scared the crap out of me as a kid. It was surprisingly true to the (very long) book- there's a lot of novel here. But overall I think I may have enjoyed the movie more- and been more scared! The book gets a bit bogged down in both development of minor characters and the sort of sketchy and unsatisfying description metaphysical forces behind the horror. There's also a little, shall we say, unexplained &#34;WTF&#34; weirdness toward the end. Not to say I didn't enjoy the book- I did!- but I think the faster-paced film had a better scares-to-exposition ratio.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|LOVE IT!! BEST TOOL TO FIND MUSIC ON THE INTERENET RIGHT HERE I LOVE THIS APP GREAT KEEP IT UP
B0037TPMOA|5.0|I had heard King's &#34;The Shining&#34; was very different from Kubrick's movie version, and it's true, but each has its own strengths. Would be a good discussion exercise for a literature class or book club! I thought King captured a kid's fears very well; some of the most suspenseful and frightening parts were from Danny's point of view. Jack's downward spiral is well-rendered, and the minor characters are also given some nice depth. Even in an age of wireless communications, the sense of isolation at the Overlook still feels palpable and relate-able. Impressive that this was King's first attempt to do psychological horror. Highly recommended!
076115678X|5.0|I had heard about the Curly Girl method from my sister who tried to explain it the best she could. After calling her multiple times with questions, she told me that I just need to get the book. I did. It is very informative, and I loved all the specific information I got for my hair type. I loved the DVD that is included, since I am a very visual learner. I was able to watch how washing, conditioning, and styling was actually supposed to be done. I love this book, and so does my hair.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love the game.  The Rio version is fun.  I purchased the game for a variety in our game collection.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am hooked on Downton Abbey. I watched season one on another source, but they did not have season 2.<br />Thank you Amazon Prime for providing this service.  I recommend Downton Abbey to everyone I know.  The<br />acting is wonderful and the storyline like a book you can't put down.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|This should probably be part of the startup pack but it gives you more flexibility to use the camera in normal situations.<br />The touchscreen can be a little temperamental sometimes but other than that it works well.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The movies are great.  The packaging is superb.  The price was right.  Can't go wrong with this.  I bought Prometheus separately so I could watch them all.
B000PKG6TY|5.0|picked up the LP which was labeled w/ \\"All Analogue Recording\\"<br />this. sounds. PHENOMENAL!<br />haven't been this satisfied w/ a record purchase in quite some time!<br />if you like BTS then the LP is definitely worth picking up, even if you already have it on CD and MP3<br />seriously
B0083SBMBM|5.0|love this movie,action packed and all of the characters told a story. Cant wait til the next installment. And Thor rocked my world
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is THE perfect Note app! Unlimited notes! Easy to use! Couldn't ask for better!  I use it almost every day!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This animated version, follows the Frank Miller adaptation superbly. The characters are complex and the story leaves you wanting more.
B00A6CT012|5.0|This is a good book as it tells you how to do it! I can not wait to finish it.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Personally as far as I go as a Star Trek fan this is the best season of The Original Series. It has great episodes and great stories. Truly the height of TOS.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|good book, It was a great summation of common happenings all in one place. Her comments and insights were thoughtful. A good call to action.
B002RI90WM|5.0|This was so beautifully written I have recommended it to many people. I loved the perspective from the dog and I now look at dogs in a very different view
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|We love Dr. who here my kids have just discover it and it is great that they can catch up on the series here on amazon
B00B69UQJY|5.0|Even after all these years they make a great album! LOVED IT! They still got it...even if it's dark and twisted at times!
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark is a excellent writer who writes so well you don't want to put her books down!  I have read many of her books all in one sitting!  I was just a little disappointed with this one though as I actually figured it out part way through the book.  All and all though, it was an excellent read, like all of Ms. Clark's books are!!!  And I have read them all!  Well worth buying!!!!!  Trish Chard
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book has opened a new world for me and has inspired me in a way! This book will touch the hearts of many and tell the story of a girl now woman and how she had to survive.
B0018QQQKS|4.0|This book was enlightening and very interesting..need to re read to make sure some details were not missed.worthwhile reading this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the best series I have read in a long time. I would give more stars if I could!!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Enough of everything to keep me interested, action, pathos, unrequited love and bad guys. It's a little long but once your into to the plot you can forgive that. Otherwise an enjoyable movie through and through, recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book makes me feel like I'm actually in the story! My favorite part was when Katniss realised the muttations resembled the dead tributes. I would recommend this to people who enjoys Suzanne Collins's books. :D
B004AUGJS8|3.0|This could have had class, it could have been something, instead of just blah.  This movie was great until it ended.  The biggest problem with this movie is also it's biggest strength.  That being that it's based on actual events and real people.  The fact that so much of this is fact makes it all the more intriguing and thought provoking.  However as well all know from the news, this whole case, the whole story is not finished.  Just like the real life story, the movie is a piece unfinished.  I'm sure that since Durst is still alive that they can't even make up a finish or what happened for fear of slander or something like that.  Wait till the facts come to the surface or after there's no fear of backlash, and then finish the story and make the movie.<br />I think all the parts of this movie was great, had me thinking and intrigued until the end.  Then I just felt like someone just pulled the plug and I wasted the last 2hours of my life.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very convenient to have on the kindle. Makes it a lot easier to balance my check book and other things. So happy I found it!!!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Purchased this app for my grandson. It locked up my Kindle Fire! It took hours to get it unlocked. I deleted this app. Beware!
B00786XVOG|5.0|I LOVE IT, this is so good when I have the time I can be at his concert as many times as I want and when I'm busy I just put on the CD and do my house work or if I'm on the go I take it with me. I love all his music and this CD/DVD all sounds good I would highly recommend.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I LOVE THAT ALL MY DEVICES ARE SYNCED--MY PC, MY PHONES, AND MY TABLET! TY TY TY !<br />HAVE SUGGESTED IT TO MANY OTHERS!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is one of the few shows that I can get the whole family to watch together (18 son, 15 year daughter). There is something for everyone. I highly recommend it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was a great novel I loved it! It's about a kid named Auggie with a deformed face just trying to fit in at his new school. His mother home schooled so there wasn't much need for Auggie to leave his house. Now Auggie try's desperately to fit in and make friends. But when kids tease Auggie behind his back how can he tell his friends from his enemies?
B000T00PE2|3.0|The music seems redundant and I would have bought a couple songs like Angel but the album will not get much play at my house.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is awesome and hard.so make it a little easier for us ok good ........so ok then thank you and by
B00000DHRZ|4.0|The Offspring are a great alt grunge punk rock band that, I believe, has influenced many punk bands,The offspring were the first real punk rock band that was populare except the ramones.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I've always enjoyed this card game, it's fun and challenging.<br />I always try to beat my last number of moves.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Superb! Splendidly cast. Great scenery. Wonderful costumes. Have watched it 4 times since receiving it and can't get the music out of my head.
B007N85POS|5.0|My son really enjoys playing this game, he watches trailers from the game again and again, and learns all kinds of tricks.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|This is the best Hitchcock movie hands down. Great actors, great locations, great story line, great music. It has it all!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|So funny and enjoyable .  The more that I read the more I enjoyed<br />It was funny and wonderful. One never knows what fie will give them
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|Duncan Whitehead has penned a wonderful story in An Actor's Life. Although a dark tale, it has a strong touch of humor. And if you like tales where the good guy comes out on top and the bad guy gets his do, you'll love An Actor's Life. I also found Whitehead's insertion of the name of his novel, The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, in his short story creative and effective. Whitehead has a successful writing future ahead.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Book two was probably my absolute favorite! I literally couldn't put it down! This last book was a slower read for me. Partially because I didn't want it to end so I would put off reading it and because it was pretty dark. I had to be in the right mood to read this one, it can really bring you down. And it only got four stars because I was not happy with what followed once Katniss finally made it to the Mayor's house. :Spoiler alert!: the entire book was dedicated to the group finally reaching the Capitol and ultimately Snow, what followed once they reached their destination was anti climatic and I was thoroughly disappointed. Total let down. I hope I explained that without giving too much away. The actual end was satisfying though. I can live with that. Lol Can't wait for the next Movie!! I hope they follow the book in this sequel as they did in the first Movie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is a great show, addicting. I wish there was an option to rent the entire first season istead of renting episode by episode. And 2.99 an episode is a little steep, but the show is great.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|A good old Irish story of children orphaned, abused then reunited. It's my understanding there was a lot of that in the early part of the century especially in very religious countries like Ireland. At least this has a happy ending unlike so many other true stories
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|The author spent a good part of the book with examples and stories that did not do much to explain the diet.  Most of this diet can be explained in about 10 pages, the rest is just fluff.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Recommend to anyone struggling with life. Simply written with powerful message to those honestly wishing to take back their pwer and enjoy life.
B0097HSS4M|2.0|I guess for what I paid it is almost ok.  I just think it should of been better.  Too basic.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|Hellen Hunt is a great actress. They did a very good job on this movie and its also based on a true event. Funny at times and very tender
B0055SJVPW|4.0|It didn't take as long as I thought. It came in a week! It was really good for a used produced.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A brief biography about the life of Tesla and his extraordinary imagination that gave life to his ground breaking inventions.
1451648537|5.0|I found this book to be an enlightening foray into a brilliant man, but also a cautionary tale. Steve Jobs achieved so much in his life, no doubt, and will live on through his legacy with both Pixar and Apple. However, he was not an angel, or perfect. People so often seem to want to place their heroes up on a pedestal. This book is a wonderful reminder that, yes, Jobs achieved much, but also that he was as flawed as any of us.<br /><br />As a history of Apple it does provide great insights. I particularly enjoyed the author's interviews with Jobs. Overall, I would urge you to read this book. If for no other reason it showed Job's will to provide great value to his customers/audiences. We can all learn from that I think.
B005BDZN62|5.0|This is the definitive performance of West Side Story as far as I'm concerned. Now that it's been restored and is presented in Blu-ray it comes back to life in great glory. Excellent film, excellent music.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Show really moves don't go to the kitchen you will miss something it's not an American show where it takes forever for something to happen. They kill off to many people to fast though. Amazon streaming through the the smart tv needs to add a upgrade to allow a watch list like on the website
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|When David Tennant announced he would end his role as Doctor Who many of us who like the show were saddened. The first three of the specials in this box are good stories but the last two are a fitting end to a great role played by an amazing actor.
0143112724|4.0|Cute, illustrated reproduction of the historic Elements of Style. This should be in every teacher’s library as well as parents who want their kids to love reading and writing.
B00005U122|5.0|I have owned \\"Roger Waters - In the Flesh (Live)\\" for about ten years now.  I have seen it, I would guess, over 100 times.  For Roger Waters, this is the definition of his work on DVD.  The DVD, obviously, is a recording of his In the Flesh tour.  The concert has a nice combination of Pink Floyd and solo material which is great.<br /><br />The quality of the concert itself is great.  Roger plays and sings (I hope he's not miming in some spots) well.  I've seen Roger live four times, and although I'm sure the DVD is enhanced in areas, the performance is spot on.  Doyle Bramhall does a good job playing David Gilmour for the tour.  I have no real complaints there.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a Pink Floyd fan, and a fan of Roger Waters in particular, you should have this DVD.  Watch it, soak in the music, and know you made the correct choice.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|Stevie has been a favorite of mine since Fleetwood Mac, and again with her solo career.  This is the only one I didn't have, and I am not dissapointed
B0060ANOXY|5.0|Amused to Death is without a doubt Roger Waters' best solo album.  In fact, I believe Amused to Death, on a whole, rivals some of the Pink Floyd greats.  I believe the album falls short of Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and Animals, Amused to Death is right there with the Wall.<br /><br />Like the Wall, there are some 'fluff' in the middle of the album, but the Bravery of Being Out of Range, Its a Miracle, and others make this album an absolute necessity for Roger Waters and Pink Floyd fans.  I highly recommend it.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Whitney is one of my favorite singers and her death was tragic.  She was an  icon and she will always be
B008MM9630|4.0|I love this game. it would be nice to get some info on how to transfer this game from one device to another though.
B009R659L8|3.0|It was fast reading, but not one of the author's best.  Too many characters with too many story lines.  Worth a read though.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|I rented it to see the South End (where I live) and couldn't get through it.  Each time it had the potential to be an interesting, reflective film about life, relationships, and growth it turned into easy, unfunny and canned knock off.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what i was looking for!! Easy, practical and the perfect size. If you need a functional calculator this is it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I would totally recommend that all my kindle friends buy one . There is just no way to get other brands to work as well with your kindle.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Book and movie very enjoyable.  Hope they have a movie for the other two books.  Series was great.  thank you.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Perhaps we should have watched the first movies over again to see if we could pick up on any plot thread because it was sure challenging to find the plot line in this movie. It simply didn't pull us into the movie. The young policeman was interesting and clearly there is a setup for a sequel. Plus, Anne Hathaway was not a convincing Cat Woman. Just didn't like it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it you have to get it I hope you like it as much as I do please consider drop everything and get the greats game ever.
B007KLKFSO|5.0|This is such a touching story. I could not put this book down and a couple of weeks after finishing it I still think about Eleanor and Park. The way I fell in love with the people in the book is unusualand the way they acted made me fall even harder.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|People often have a knee-jerk reaction to Malick's films, but as always, they often realize weeks, months, or even years later that his films hold up better than most others. Of the films Affleck acted in this past year, people will likely remember this one over Argo. You may disagree because it won the Best Picture Oscar, but have your parents name all the Oscar winners in their lifetime... I doubt many left a strong impression later.<br /><br />What Malick achieves in this film is unparalleled. The social norms and expectations of a husband or wife are set in the scope of what love should be. It's not titles or roles, but humility towards others. To not only make oneself happy or better, but to make your loved ones - as well as others - the same. \\"One doesn't find her lovely, he makes her lovely\\".<br /><br />Some will find parts cliche, but only those with the shallowest of interpretations. These \\"cliches\\" are often depicted in ways that, in contrast to the ethereal, reveals how desperate we grasp for another's love.
