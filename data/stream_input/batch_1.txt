1563890119|4.0|this is the first 8 issues of the series. it is the starting point of all this... it also contains the sound of her wings. issue #8. which is the first appearance of death. and many peoples favorite issue. its not the best of the collected works. but its the start of them.
1559947608|4.0|I've always been partial to immutable laws. The tape is entertaining, good car listening. The laws are clearly self evident once you've  heard them and you wonder why you didn't know  all that already and were about to go off and  do something stupid.  It's cheap, get it.
0671701800|5.0|This is a book about first contact with aliens, written by a prominent member of SETI, the Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence. Sagan makes excellent use of  SETI's current search methods as well as his own  knowledge of astronomy and physics to bring a sense of  reality to the book. But above its literacy, philosophy,  and speculation, it is an entertaining story that is not  overshadowed by gadgetry.
0425132153|5.0|This is quite possibly *the* funniest book I have ever read.  Terry Pratchett is an absolute genius (read the Discworld books--NOW!),  and Gaiman manages to give the book the appropriate dark touches.  Brilliant
0517122707|5.0|The story behind the book is almost better than the work. But make no mistake, the work will endure.
0345350499|5.0|Marion Zimmer Bradley brings King Arthur's court to life through the eyes of a woman in The Mists of Avalon.  It is by far one of the best novels I've ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who is interested in seeing a legend from a different point of view

0887306667|5.0|This book is a fast read.   It covers strategic, high-level  marketing like no other marketing book,   and I'm a Marketing MBA who has read 400+ marketing books.    The book shows how &quot;positioning&quot; is critical for any business.    And the 22 laws can be reduced   to a list that fits on one page.    Absolutely Excellent.
044022165X|5.0|John Grisham's The Rainmaker keeps you guessing &amp; keeps  the pages turning as you route for the underdog &amp; recent law school graduate, Rudy Baylor, as he takes on the one of   the most revered law firms in Memphis.  I didn't expect much - but I think this is John Grisham's finest!  I highly recommend it!
0425107469|5.0|This was my first (I've read all his books!) and favorite book.  The story is not only compelling but heartwarming as well.  It mixes horror and science fiction (fact?) with people who are very real with   believable problems and takes you on an amazing adventure.  If you were  interested in Dean Koontz and want to try one of his books, this is the  one!
0880389052|5.0|I usually don't like TSR books, but Homeland just blew me  away. A society of *EVIL* 'Drow' elves live underground. One elf breaks the mold and fights for what he feels is  right. Beautifully written with increadible fighting scenes.  Intricate plot and so many twists and turns your head'll  spin.        Book #1 in a 9 book series, it actually was the fourth  book written (Crystal Shard was first, from the Icewind   Trilogy) but it is MUCH better if you read the Dark Elf   Trilogy then Icewind Trilogy and then the following 3 books.  #9th book leaves so much unanswered and I don't know if he's  going to continue. Does anyone know?
0446310786|5.0|On the surface, first-person story of a young girl's adventures in a small southern town during the depression. Story addresses impact of economic hardship and extreme  racial injustice through the eyes of the heroine without  patronizing her.    I believe the character of &quot;Dill&quot; was based on Truman  Capote, a childhood friend of Harper Lee.    One of the finest books I have ever read; I generally  reread it every year or two.

0451169514|5.0|I have to say, that when Stephen King wrote this book he truly outdid himself.  Stephen King enters you into the world of  seven children that are bonded by destiny to fight evil itself  in the form of a clown that haunts them and kills other children.    After they thought they had killed IT, 20 something years later, IT  comes back and they are drawn back to their hometown to face  the same evil they faced as children but now they are adults  and actually don't have their innocence and imagination, which  were their advantages over IT.  You'll be hooked until the end  until one of the forces wins, IT or the force that draws the children  (now adults) toghether.
0316920045|5.0|I've been waiting for a book to take me by the hair and drag me, like Gaddis but enthralling, like Pynchon but still unread.  Wallace delivers genuis of our times (and times surely to come.)  Every character, every scene (seemingly every thought that's gone through this guy's head for the last few years...) is here.  Couldn't push it on enough of my friends -- I don't know what the naysayers could be talking about

I read this book just after I had turned 17, and was blown away by the outstanding skill Card uses to convey his characters' humanness - their trials, tribulations,   victories and defeats. The book touched me, moved me in a way   books don't normally do - I read it in one sitting, from 2   til 5:30 in the morning - I just could NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!

0884271153|4.0|Review of  \\"It's Not Luck\\" by Eliyahu M. Goldratt:This story is about marketing and competitive strategy.  Alex Rogo, Mr. Goldratt's fictional hero, has to save three of his companies and hundreds of employees from the chopping block of corporate divestiture by applying logic and persuasive skills. Mr. Goldratt conducts his unique style of logical examination in a field different from that of the \\"The Goal\\", his first and more famous book.  While \\"The Goal\\" says run your production operation for cash, \\"It's Not Luck\\" says the value of a product, or an entire business, is in the eye of the buyer, not the supplier.  A management book without the jargon and trendiness you get elsewhere.
0517122707|5.0|I've already worn out a copy of this book, and I'm writing this review as I prepare to purchase another copy.  Don't let this book pass you by!  If you have even the slightest sense of humor, you'll be disappointed when the end finally comes.  However, Ignatius will make you laugh out loud several times before the end finally comes.  See how long it takes you to wear out your first copy...  Enjoy!
0887307876|4.0|It is amazing (and embarrassing) how often I saw myself and my co-workers described in this book. The cartoons are excellent as usual. I didn't give this book a 10 because some of the filler was very inane. I was often tempted to skip over the text just to read (and re-read) the cartoons. This book must be in your business library. It says some things about the way we manage (and are managed) in the business setting that cut right to the quick of our personalties. I couldn't read this book at work because it was too laugh out loud funny
0316920045|5.0|This is the kind of book that you are likely to have extreme opinions about.  You'll either love it (I fall into this category), or you'll find it completely unreadable.  There is a plot (of sorts) revolving around the Infinite Jest video (the book's McGuffin), an &quot;entertainment&quot; so completely involving that viewers will starve to death watching it over and over.  However, this is merely the backdrop for a series of stories involving tennis, drug and alcohol recovery, the nature of addiction:  the stories go on and on.<br />The book is VERY long, but  I found myself enthralled by Wallace's storytelling ability - for all of the book's modernist quirks, the good old fashioned storyteller's art saves Infinite Jest time and time again.  As with any book of this length, there are passages the book could probably do without (for my money, a long sequence involving a nuclear war game, Eschaton, would be cut), but I didn't want the book to end.  At 1000+ pages (with footnotes), some of the individual stories are left unresolved, which is perhaps part of the point; I would gladly read a sequel
0399128964|5.0|This is one of perhaps 8 books that I would give a 10 to<br />and would be my unhesitating answer to the question, &quot;What<br />is the best sci-fi novel of all time?&quot;<br /><br /> Herbert has achieved what very very few sci-fi writers do:<br /> he has created a complex and utterly believable &quot;universe&quot;<br /> that is almost wholly alien to our own. Yet despite this<br /> yawning gulf, Herbert spells nothing out; we learn about the<br /> universe by seeing it through the eyes of the<br /> extraordinarily compelling characters who inhabit it.<br /><br /> This is not an easy read, and it takes more than a single<br /> reading to really appreciate it. NB: do NOT make any assumptions based on the movie. It simply<br /> doesn't compare.
0060171928|4.0|Despite arguements about the precision of the facts in the book, I found this book engaging and impossible to put down.  For all those jaded literary snobs, don't bother, but if you like a good story and are prepared to suspend disbelief for a short time you will find this book just what the doctor ordered
0440178002|5.0|And you thought only science fiction could take you beyond where you are today.  James Clavell submerges you in 16th century Japan where you experience the power struggles,  romance, and even the language.  By the end of the novel,   you you will have seen peasants   getting chopped up for not bowing low enough, samurai   commiting seppuku for arriving late, and Jesuit priests   grovelling for converts.  This is probably  the best book I've ever read in terms of connecting with  the characters' own triumphs and tribulations.  Wakarimasu   ka?  Enjoy!
0679416781|4.0|I would advise people who want to read this book to take it slowly.  Michael Ondaatje's unusual style of prose can make it very difficult reading.  But once you get through it you are definitley home free.  I really enjoyed it and advise people to open it up and enjoy.
044022165X|5.0|This novel is the best novel I read of John Grisham. This novel has a bit of everything: a a lot of humor, a bit of action, a bit of romance, and it has a lot of suspense. As  the story ends the suspense rises and doesn`t stop until the  last few pages.  It shows viewpoints of issues like spousal   abuse.  The best thing of this book is the complex plotting.

006091307X|5.0|The Crying of Lot 49 is truly one of the most amazing books  I've read -- period.  The story involves one Oedipa Maas and  the adventure she has while being the executor of Pierce   Inverity's will.  She encounters a possible postal conspiracy   dating back to Roman times, characters and stores that vanish   from the planet, and enough mysteries and confusion to last   a lifetime.<br />   This book must be analyzed at some level as you   read it to take full advantage of all the layers, symbols,   and themes.  The more you analyze it, the better it gets, but   the more you have to analyze!  I still don't know how   Pynchon keeps everything separate!

I've always wanted to learn more about the history of philosophy but it is a severely daunting subject usually encased in great tomes that intimidate far more than they entice.  Jostein Gaarder makes one wonder why everyone else always over complicated the matter.

0345349571|2.0|Barbara Tuchman's attempt at this is unbelievable.  The  book is essentially a rambling of medival history which often refers back to a certain dynasty.  It is filled with  hundreds of obscure French names which have nothing to do  with anything.  Tuchman jumps from one topic to another,   creating a loose (even non-existant) organization which  leaves the reader lost and confused.  Tuchman seems to   think that her reader already knows the information she  is trying to convey.  It is almost as if Tuchman sat down  at a typewriter and asked herself, &quot;what do I know about  medival European history?&quot; and then wrote whatever came to  her mind, when ever it came to her mind.  With the exception  of the 5th chapter, which details the death and suffering  of millions during the various plagues, the novel is as dry  as sand.  The book's only merit is its informational value,  which if the reader can follow, or for that matter even  stay awake, he may gain something from this book.
0060916540|5.0|Joe Simpson's writing style is perfectly balanced for  creating a sense of sustained tension. I read this book  in two sittings and found it to be among the best adventure  books I have ever read. Simpson's follow-up book, &quot;The Game   of the Ghosts&quot; is a must read after this one.  After reading &quot;Touching the Void&quot; I find myself looking at  personal motivation in a different light.
0345349571|4.0|<br />Barbara Tuchman's work is in the genre of the essayists of the 19th century. Like them, she is erudite, humorous, and  at times, disorganized. <br />But how could it be otherwise? Imagine writing such a work about the 20th century, attempting to describe for  someone 600 years hence how we have   lived over these last hundred years, and how we have changed.<br />   This is a work which some may wish to plow though in several days; others will   put it by their best arm chair and read a section at a time. <br />   Given the horror of Bosnia, the tedium of politics, and the    daily drudge (which at times seems in spirit to be remarkably similar to that which Tuchman describes) such a work of Tuckman's can lift us up and help us to see beyond our own calamitous   century -- plus ca change; plus la meme chose.   <br />   KRH<BR>   [...]
0887307876|5.0|Not since the discovery of Parkinson's Law and the formulation of The Peter Principle has there been anything quite as poignant and timely as the conception of The Dilbert Principle. &quot;The most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage - MANAGEMENT.&quot; That's the essence and message of The Dilbert Principle. With over 250,000 copies in print and a meteoric rise to No. 1 on Business Weeks's hardcover business books best-seller list, this revenge of the cubicle dwellers is a mix of cartoon strips and Scott Adams' succinct observations describing ridiculous company policies and dysfunctional management practices. Not surprisingly, the message is coming in loud and clear in high places. Reengineering guru Michael Hammer has jumped on the Dilbert bandwagon by suggesting that &quot;there is more truth in one volume of Dilbert than there is in 10 volumes of Harvard Business School case studies.&quot; Dilbert pokes fun at organizations where nothing ever really changes except the business buzzwords and corporate slogans. Perhaps that's the secret of the strip's success, both in the U.S. and abroad. &quot;Everybody thinks Dilbert is making fun of somebody else's situation,&quot; suggests Adams, an ex-Pacific Bell cubicle dweller for the past nine years until he was &quot;downsized&quot; recently when his department came under new management. Is &quot;bitter irony&quot; the right phrase? Or perhaps the &quot;system getting even?&quot; In the book's introduction, under the heading &quot;The Evolution of Idiots&quot;, Adams expounds: Theory of Evolution (Summary) First, there were some amoebas. Deviant amoebas adapted better to the environment, thus becoming monkeys. Then came Total Quality Management. I'm leaving out some detail, but the theory itself also has a few holes that are best left unquestioned.

0393037010|5.0|Rated 9 only because I lacked the courage to rate it 10.    If you like to read books you will probably be swept away  by this novel, the first of a thankfully long series by   Patrick O'Brian.    The subjects are the British Navy of the Napoleonic Wars and  two men: Aubrey -- a naval officer and (one quickly assumes)  one of the best sailors who has ever lived and Maturin -- a  physician and &quot;agent extraordinaire&quot; who seems to be  bent  on giving Thomas Jefferson a run for his money as  the man who knows the most of everything that could  be known.    O.K. so you don't like war, sailing, or the early 19th century.  After a few minutes reading this book, you will.  Even lazy  readers (myself for example) will suddenly develop a great  interest in the rigging of three-masted sailing vessels of  the era.      And did I mention, color, romance, and character   development?  A lot of natural science as well.    The publisher offers the whole set of Aubrey/Maturin  novels in hardback for a package price because many  who read the first will be tempted to just buy them  all and avoid any waits in between.  I'm certainly  tempted.
0345403959|5.0|Thoroughly entertaining, plus it gives you insight into all the events and EVENTS that led up to the other series of books by Eddings.  I couldn't put it down!!
0070212570|5.0|This is the kind of book that will take you out of whatever section of our often dreary, unkind world you inhabit, and settle you down in its own place.  You'll meet characters who know which rules to break,  and how to break them properly. The writing is lovingly  infused with the flavor of the south, and with a kind  of humor that an author couldn't take on if it weren't   genuine. And when it's over, you'll be sad that you don't  live in Whistle Stop, but it will be OK, because Whistle  Stop lives in this book and you can always reread it.
0312932081|5.0|Ender's Game is an incredible,unforgettable book that will stay with you. It follows the early years of a &quot;Third&quot; child. A misfit in society. From his home on Earth to a military academy in space, it tells a gripping and unpredictable story that will keep you guessing until the shocking end. This is one of the few books to have made an everlasting emotional impact on me. I give it my highest recommendation
0553208845|5.0|Hardly in need of further literary acclaim, Herman Hesses Siddhartha nonetheless forces this reader to relate yet another positive response.  From the standpoint of a recently undergraduated copywriter in need of a solid vision for the future, Siddharthas trials and eventual spiritual grounding and discovery are meaningful and, at last, comforting revelations that have forced me to examine my own spirituality, materialism, romances, and values.<br /><br />The importance of observing and feeling everything with an open heart and mind while following your own deepest inclinations and directions is the only way to truly determine where you belong, Siddharthas words and actions inform the reader.  From forest to town to river, Siddhartha is welcome and loved for he learns from and gives to all that come to know him.  He gives questions to a spiritual leader and passion to a woman.  He gives success to a business and instruction to a friend.  And finally, Hesses creation gives the reader inspiration and motivation for a closer look at every river along the way to greater self-understanding.<br /><br /> In honesty, when I was first commissioned to read Siddhartha I glanced through the first few pages and put it down for reasons I cannot recall.  Maybe I was too enveloped in the adventures of Henry Chinaski or engaged with the Coma Baby.  I cannot remember.  Anyway, I wish I had read the story then and I am glad I have read it now.
0393314804|5.0|So I cheated.  I haven't read the book, but I saw the movie, and if that is any indication, this is a book in the spirit of A Clockwork Orange and other drug-induced classics.

0440211727|5.0|Finally, A Time to Kill, John Grisham's first novel, is a feature length movie. I just read this book, but I knew it was realeased in 1989. I'm only thirteen, and this was my first Grisham book.  In this story, Grisham hits us with a subject that most might not like to discuss: child rape. Ten-year old Tonya Hailey is brutally raped and almost killed by two drunken rednecks; perhaps the saddest and hardest part to get through with the addition of little Tonya's dream of her father running to get her. After this horrid crime is committed, Tonya's father, Carl Lee exacts vengeance on the two rednecks, and kills them. He is put on trial, and lawyer Jake Brigance is introduced to us. He takes Carl Lee's case and must face his hated enemy, Rufus Buckley, in court. The days leading to the trial are filled with KKK threats, riots between blacks and the KKK, and several other chills and spills. Finally, the trial comes and the small town of Clanton, where the trial is held, is occupated by journalists, soldiers, KKK members, and thousands of blacks, as they all wait for the verdict on the edge of their seats..
0060175184|5.0|A serious all-encompassing look at the rags-to-riches versus silver spoon stories as only Jeffrey Archer can do.  This is the inspiring story of two men who have each built vast  media empires and are now battling to save them.

This   book is written by an expert in human affairs who writes an  easily readable and simply incredible novel.  Very highly  recommended.
0440178002|5.0|Like Toranaga, Ishido, Mariko, and the other major characters,  John Blackthorne was a real person. From W. Scott Morton (1994, McGraw-Hill), &quot;Japan: Its History and Culture,&quot; pages 118-119:   &quot;It was by a strange accident that he [Ieyasu, or 'Yoshi Toranaga']   found one of his most valuable experts, a shipbuilder, Will Adams,  pilot-major of a small Dutch flotilla, who was one of the  few survivors of a typhoon which severely damaged the flagship,   the 'Liefde' [Erasmus]. ...&quot; Adams was from Kent, England. In his youth, he  was an apprentice to a shipwright. Adams warned Ieyasu about Spain's  and Portugal's desire to propagate Catholocism into Japan, and said that  other nations (England and Holland) were interested only in trade.   Now, for what became of Blackthorne after Toranaga's victory at   Sekigahara... he acquired a large estate in Japan, and married a  Japanese woman. Adams never returned to England. He died in Japan,   laden with honors (presumably from Ieyasu), but still longing for  his homeland. There is a monument to Will Adams in Japan, near the sea.   Ieyasu, possibly because of Adams' influence, expelled the Christain  missionaries a while later: Lord Kiyama (Takayama Ukon) left Japan in  exile to Manila, where he died shortly afterward.

Ishiguro takes the reader into the narrator's conscious thoughts, leaving the unmentioned unconscious emotions as a subtle, yet powerful aftertaste....although love, desire, and loss are never mentioned outright, the final product leaves the reader feeling the lonely emptyness Steven's feels, but never admits, even to himself.
0345909887|4.0|This is one of those books you'll read voraciously, then put down and go, &quot;Huh?&quot;  While revealing anything about the plot you won't read in the first few pages will give too much away, suffice it to say that Clarke's opinions about the fate of humanity may raise your eyebrow.  You'll probably either love it, or wonder if you're time wasn't wasted.  As I said: fascinating, though not for everyone
0385424736|5.0|From the first page to the last a gripping novel which  keeps you attention.  Marvelous outcome.
044022165X|5.0|I picked up this book while delayed for several hours at Detroit Airport, and wow!  I couldn't put it down.  I read it almost straight through over the next couple of days, and it is one of the best books I've read.  Very exciting
0345350499|5.0|Bradley's Mists of Avalon is one of the best novels I've ever read; I've given it to a variety of friends with vastly different tastes in reading and everyone has loved it. Reams have been written about the Arthurian legends, but Bradley spins her tale from a different perspective--that of the women of Avalon--and creates an beautiful, enthralling novel. It's one of the few books I've never wanted to end. Her post-Mists books don't come close to this one
0061003697|5.0|This is a must have for Agatha Christie fans. The novel is equal to &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; in  spellbinding plot. The characters are well developed and you are drawn into their lives. I read this book every summer and I still find it captivating. Even my sister who is not a &quot;Christie&quot; fan was glued to the   TV when the movie version was playing. This is a tough one to figure out but you might get a clue if you read carefully.
0393314804|5.0|When I first came across Trainspotting in the fall of 1994 I was reluctant to immerse myself in the graphic protrayal of heroin addicts. After seeing the film on a visit to &quot;Auld Reekie&quot; this spring I reconsidered.<br />  I say to anyone who isn't quite sure about whether or not to take on the adventure of Trainspotting that it is worth it. Yes, much of the subject matter is dark (comedy) but Welsh's writing is spectacular, you begin to understand the depths of the human condition and how we get there. (PS- Scots can be tricky but most of the slang can be understood from context)
0425107469|5.0|I say &quot;gripping&quot; because I can't put the book down.  Ordered it through Amazon a little while ago and it's AWESOME!  Better than &quot;Icebound.&quot;  If you like Cussler and Clancy you'll love Koontz
0440211727|5.0|It is my first John Grishams book.  I get the book from my  Australian co-worker when come to US for a meeting.  This  book turns me into a Grishams book fan overnight.   <br />   The book is easy to read but hard to put down.  It forces   my hand to into a page turning machine.  The characters in   the book can be found in real life.  A kid, father, lawyer,   judge, black folks, KKK members and journalists, all run   into each other life and create all the tensions and loves.   It is a good book to read but you will hate it because it    stop you from doing everything else.
0393312836|5.0|Burgess himself has criticized and attacked this novel which he published in 1968, but which has come to be regarded alongside such dystopian classics as _Brave New World_ and,  perhaps more appropriately, Yevgeny Zamyatin's _We_. An  unsparing story of a sociopathic hoodlum, Alex, _A Clockwork  Orange_ is shocking and often a difficult read despite the  bizarre and sometimes surreal street language employed by  its narrator, a dialect of some archaic words, a few   neologisms, and a great deal of Anglicized Russian. The   film by Stanley Kubrick is equally disturbing, but, as   Burgess himself notes in the introduction to this edition,  leaves off the crucial twenty-first chapter, a chapter that  is vital to the book both for its numerical significance  (twenty-one being considered the age of maturity), and its  philosophical poignance.
0872860175|5.0|Allen Ginsberg's Howl is W.C. Williams vision of a &quot;New Measure&quot; made concrete.  It is not only a poem, as such but a lyrical cry  that echoes  throughout the page and the reader's mind as he/she  lets the words rebound off a boundless  mind/soul.  It is as if Ginsberg broke free from   the word-form lines that confine thought and   let his untampered ideas flow free onto the page  and then just leave them there to reform themselves  in the readers mind exactly as Ginsberg thought  them.  He not only cast his un-strained thoughts   onto the page but also poured them into a mind-  breath mould that allowed them to be measured   by each breath the mind takes, re-inhaling the  glorious fumes with the base repitition of &quot;Who...&quot;  This not only gives the poem a measurable quality but  also an ethereal quality because it is not measured  physically but with each breath of the mind.  The second stanza is one of industrial wickedness  and power-hunger as well as divine-right rule and  god-like evil.  It shows Moloch as The Tyrant and  money, corruption and greed as his arms, legs and blood.  The whole poems shines like a glossy white garage  on a soot covered hill.
0812550706|5.0|This book has been called the &quot;Science fiction book for people who don't think they like science fiction.&quot;  Although cliche aliens are there I understand that was intentional and is all part of the overall story. I didn't read it for the action but it there (in the form of the Battle Room).  It portrays the desperation of a species trying to survive and what it is willing to do to one child (Ender) to accomplish this goal
0812548094|5.0|This book made me a fan of Terry Goodkind, if the first one had not.  It was hard to put down and I finished it in one long weekend.  I have read a lot of Sci-fi and Fantasy but not much this good.  I am totally captivated by the characters, the world they live in and their stories.  The writing is tight and well done, the plot well thought out and the story twists enough to keep you turning the pages til 2 or 3 in the morning.  I am looking forward to more in the third book of the series...I can hardly wait to see what happens next
0812548094|4.0|The Stone of Tears is an excellent sequel to Wizards First Rule, and though I must admit that I liked the First Rule better, the Second book was quite enthralling.  It further probes the love of Richard and Kahlan and reveales valuable insight into our own lives.  2 thumbs up
0887307876|4.0|Having followed Dilbert and especially Dogbert with complete devotion for several years now, I was itching to get my hands on this latest &quot;serious&quot; book by Scott Adams.  I participated in the Dilbert Principle On-Line Trivia Contest and became a finalist...still waiting to hear who won!  This, I believe, qualifies me to say that I have read the book from cover to cover and back again.  The actual e-mail that Adams has received from readers about their work situation (ie corporate culture) and dumb things done by &quot;superiors&quot; is priceless. Adams has a flair for understanding the world of work from the end user perspective.  There are numerous classic Dilbert strips as well.  Some of the chapters are a bit too long and drawn out, but overall this is an amusing book.  I recommend giving it anonymously to your boss for Christmas.  You know you'll just be recipient of yet another fruitcake!  Besides, the Dilbert Web site is a riot!      DNRC Members: this is a must-read!
0140049975|5.0|The summary on the back of the book will tell you that this  is a novel about the relationships between brothers. If you  read the author's dedication, however, you will come to understand that   this book is Steinbeck's life's work and, as such, deals with the subject   that he held most dear. It is a book about man's concience; a   great book -- one of the greatest I have read, and its epic storyline   is filled with wonderful characters and constant action. <br />    The story transcends three generations, the breadth of the country   and several families and explores its characters and their actions   as only Steinbeck can. Read it.
0425107469|4.0|This was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  As with most of Dean Koontz's books, I do not recommend reading it at home alone at night.  In this book Dean Koontz manages to make the characters three dimensional, even  the non-human characters.  As with many of his books, he has included  a dog as one of the main characters in this book, and his ability to  explain canine behavior is very enjoyable.       This book focuses on the escape of two very different creatures from  a laboratory conducting DNA research.  One is a golden retriever with  near human intelligence.  The other is a vicious hybrid creature   genetically engineered to be a terrifying force on the battlefield.  The creature is stalking the dog and killing anything that comes in   its path.  The dog teams up with a paralysingly shy young woman and   a depressed man and turns their life around.  The dog and the couple  are then hunted by the NSA, the creature and a crazed psycopath.
0345403959|5.0|This book is a must read for fans of the Eddings' &quot;Belgariad&quot; and &quot;Mallorean&quot;.  It finally answers all those questions we had about Belgarath, and is written with all the poignancy, warmth,   and humor we would expect in a tale told by Belgarath himself.    I couldn't put it down.
0812550706|5.0|A riveting book. I couln't put it down until the last page was read! This book is what Sci-Fi should be.
0316920045|5.0|The Doorstop's Here   A hellaciously gifted young writer named David Foster Wallace has just written a   huge new novel called ``Infinite Jest,'' and somebody really ought to smack him with it.          It takes a special kind of nerve to write a book with roughly the mass of a medicine   ball, and then end it so unsatisfyingly that the poor reader perversely finds himself wishing   it longer. But Wallace's limp coda only disappoints because the preceding three-and-a-half   inches of ``Infinite Jest'' have succeeded so well at projecting a world of brain-scalding   complexity.     But when is Wallace carefully teasing out a recurrent motif, it's worth   wondering, and when is he just repeating himself? Literally from first page to last, though,   Wallace has given us a meditation on addiction -- the addiction of a tennis prodigy to   organic narcotics, of a paroled second-story man to inorganic ones, of the terrorist to his   cause, the couch potato to mindless pleasures, and ultimately, the unkickable addiction of   readers to all those old storytelling conventions Wallace gleefully blows up like a rotten kid   cherry-bombing an electric train.     The biggest addiction on display here may be Wallace's own, to writing, a habit so   consuming that the only way for him to shake it is with an abrupt, cold-turkey ending.   Luckily, savingly, ``Infinite Jest'' has a second serve to fall back on: its authentically   hysterical, drink-milk-at-your-peril humor.     Here's Wallace doing an overzealous high-school tennis announcer: ``Lamont Chu disembowelled Charles Pospisilova 6-3, 6-2; Peter Beak spread   Ville Dillard on a cracker like some sort of hors d'oeuvre and bit down 6-4, 7-6...while   Gretchen Holt made PW's Tammi Taylor-Bing sorry her parents were ever in the same   room together 6-0, 6-3...''     This is comic overkill of the wettest possible water, the sort of stuff good for   reading aloud to one's more indulgent friends -- ``Wait, just one more'' -- taking care to   leave out expressions like ``SACPOP'' that Wallace doesn't even see fit to explain until 100   pages later, in a slapstick set piece so funny you forgive him immediately. The passage is   also symptomatic of one of Wallace's bad habits, namely, too many characters too quickly   introduced and never adequately differentiated -- not a bad metaphor for the whole high   school experience, but also a hallmark of too many fat books one finds in used-book stores   with their first couple of chapters thoroughly begrimed and the rest in near-mint condition.     ``Infinite Jest'' should find a kinder posterity in just about any near future except the   one where it takes place, sometime early in the next century. Books don't count for much   in Wallace's dystopia, and the only one mentioned is a copy of William James' ``Varieties   of Religious Experience'' long since hollowed out as a stashbox.     Just how early in the next century this is can't be pinned down, as the Gregorian   calendar has long since made way for Subsidized Time, which takes the concept of   commercial sponsorship to its logical terminus by rechristening 2001 or 2020 A.D. or   whatever, as the Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken, the Year of the Depend Adult   Undergarment, &amp;c. Like much else in the book, this tactic is mysterious at first, a scream   when Wallace lets you in on the joke, and kind of a pain by the time he beats it into the   ground. Mercifully, he starts abbreviating the years after a while, then changes his mind   and goes right back to spelling them out.     Approriately for a book about addiction, ``Infinite Jest'' is told largely in flashbacks.   The novel begins with Hal Incandenza, its tennis prodigy antihero, suffering a mysterious   seizure during an Arizona college interview early in the Year of Glad, as in trashbags. We   then backpedal to the rigorously regimented Enfield Tennis Academy near Boston, Hal's   and our home off and on for the bulk of the book. E.T.A is the brainchild of Hal's late   father, J.O., a man of high and wide attainments, last but not least of them artfully cutting a   large hole into the door of a microwave oven, inserting his head, and letting it rip.     J.O.'s place on campus and in Hal's mother's bed has fallen to a shady relation,   giving rise to the suspicion, reinforced by the book's title, that what we've really signed on   for is some hypermodern pastiche of ``Hamlet.'' This holds water as far as it goes, viz.,   until Wallace starts cross-cutting between the Academy and its Enfield neighbor, a   dilapidated halfway house for dipso- and other maniacs. At this point, a fresh scenario   pokes its head out of the verbal thicket -- that ``Hamlet'' is just a red herring, and that   Wallace is really concocting a sort of elephantine variation on ``Entropy,'' Thomas   Pynchon's classic short story of contrasted chaos and regimentation.     Wallace's other novel, ``The Broom of the System,'' has already elicited cries of   ``Pynchonesque!'' from diverse quarters, some of them, to be sure, using the adjective in its   usual sense, i.e., as reviewer's code for ``I didn't finish it,'' others so besotted with Pynchon   that they see his scat everywhere, but a few finding genuine similarities. Both men do share   a head for science, a stomach for gross-out humor, a great ear, and a soft spot for the word   ``maffick,'' but Wallace definitely has the lower opinion of sloth.     This emerges from a third thread in ``Infinite Jest,'' one that pulls it beyond the   realm of homage to either Shakespeare or Pynchon. Hal's father, during his avant-garde   filmmaker phase, has somehow made a movie so enjoyable as to be 100% lethal. All   viewers unfortunate enough to catch even a snippet of this mortally popular production,   which ironically shares its title with the novel, at once live only to see it again and again,   lapsing into a persistent vegetative state from which only drool-drowning will ever deliver   them. All copies have now gone missing, and the post-NAFTA Organization of North   American Nations (O.N.A.N.) is ineptly racing to find them before they can fall into the   Wrong Hands, namely those of a splinter group of legless Quebecois separatists in   wheelchairs.     If this starts to sound a mite daffy, it's also deadly serious. Like ``1984'' and ``A   Clockwork Orange,'' both of which he unmistakably invokes, Wallace's critique of a future   society whose only grail has become the hangoverless bender, the infinite jest -- the   neverending Year of Glad -- rings so true and contemporary it's almost late.     In a way, of course, it is. Everybody from Neil Postman in ``Amusing Ourselves to   Death'' to 10,000 Maniacs in ``Candy Everybody Wants'' has tilled this ground before.   What keeps it fresh is Wallace's prose style, a compulsively footnoted amalgam of   stupendously high-toned vocabulary and giddy low-comedy diction, coupled to a sense of   syntax so elongated that he can seem to go for days without surfacing. At times he appears   determined to end each sentence with a preposition or not at all, with perhaps the slight   edge going to not at all. A Wallace sentence finally draws to a close amid reluctance and   relief, like a hitting streak. Half the time you'll want to pitch the damn book clear into the   next room, with or without benefit of doorway, but the other half you can actually feel   your attention span stretching back out to where it belongs.     Then, contrary to the occasional renegade suspicion, it ends. Little gets resolved,   least of all a reason for Hal's first-chapter seizure, although at least three good guesses   come to mind. Several well-developed characters and one improbably touching romance all   come to naught. Pynchonesque, some will say, but with Pynchon, he's playing with the   whole idea of narrative closure, not thumbing his nose at you for giving a damn.      Finishing ``Infinite Jest,'' one feels less played with thantoyed with. Still, better to   be toyed with by a genius than pandered to by some second-rater who'd write a few   hundred pages and give up. And Wallace has a toybox to do Pandora proud.
0393314804|5.0|On the surface, this novel is an unapologetic story  about junkies. But there's much more to it than that: You're missing half the meaning of the novel if you  don't catch the references to Kierkegaard. Ultimately,  the characters are wrestling with the concept of morality.  Renton mirrors Kierkegaard's spiritual development, but   with a twist. I don't want to give too much away, so you   must read it yourself. Each chapter is a story unto itself,  full of wit and irony. I couldn't put it down!
0312853254|5.0|The above critique is harsh and unfair. This is (so far, I haven't read Children of the Mind&quot;) the best Ender's Series Book. It is much more indepth and thought-provoking than  Ender's Game, but it doesn't have the same intense flow of  an action book that Ender's Game does. The view the reader  gets of Ender in Ender's Game is only a misleading scratch  in the surface of this caring, human-nature genius. This  book has more originality and drive than Xenocide. Speaker   for the Dead is very different than Ender's Game, it is not  another &quot;war&quot; book, it is a &quot;serious&quot; book, and definitely  worth reader AFTER Ender's Game    the adult Ender.
0140013997|5.0|Gerald Durrell recounts his childhood in Greece.  His very British, highly eccentric family - and his love of nature - blend in unexpected ways. By turn hilarious and poignant,  the book draws sharp character sketches of the author's  relatives (including his equally famous brother, the  author Lawrence Durrell).  Sharing the spotlight are the  fascinating flora and fauna young Gerald stumbles across  on his island.  Even if you thought you couldn't stand   Biology as a student in school, Durrell's descriptions are  so beautifully written, each discovery so exquisitely etched  that you cannot but wonder at the beauty of Nature - and  the amazing gift of prose that Durrell, a naturalist by  profession, brings to this unforgettable book.  It makes you  thirst for more of the same, and happily for us, Durrell has  written several books.. worthy sequels to this tour de   force.
067960085X|5.0|Truman Capote's novella Breakfast at Tiffany's is another caseof the book far outstripping the movie in terms of characterizationand content.  Those familiar with the movie will find a much less uplifting experience in the book, but an experience well worth the time.  While I thouroghly enjoyed the movie, the book shows different sides of the characters and portrays more of the angst which is only touched upon in the movie.<br />This book receives my highest possible recommendation.
0316920045|5.0|Quite simply, this book is hilarious (in a good way). Reading Wallace reminds me why I can never be a great writer.  I love the right brain/left brain jazz that is  Wallace's style.  I also just finished &quot;Girl With Curious Hair&quot;, Wallace's  collection of short stories which is also great.  If you're scared of the length of &quot;...Jest&quot;, check out his  short stories first.   You'll be back
067942850X|4.0|_Into the Wild_ is a good read, but frustrating. It is part confession, part narrative, and part meditation on what motivates people-- generally young men-- to make  high risk journeys. Krakauer is at his best when he is  able to suspend rumination, and make the imaginative leap  into the queer, bright, grandiose mind of Chris McCandless,  who starved to death in Alaska after choosing to neglect  almost every common sense measure for wilderness survival.  Krakauer's own autobiographical chapters illuminate his own   long entanglement with risk, but tend to break up the main   story. As with Krakauer's articles in _Outside_ magazine,  I wished for a strong editor, and one good rewrite.
0425132153|4.0|Yeah, it's hilarious, and yeah, comparisons to Hitchhiker's Guide are inevitable, but, well, look. Forget 'Who Wrote the Bible?' because this is it. The first chapter says it  all. The humor is excellent, and the theme of the reality  behind the supposed war between heaven and hell is one that  Gaiman has explored more than once; it's reminiscent of  &quot;Sandman: Season of Mists&quot; and the short story &quot;Murder  Mysteries&quot; (from the collection &quot;Angels and Visitations&quot;).  This is an ideal partnership and one that I, for one,  applaud.
0345350499|5.0|I will simply add to the praise posted here; this book is wonderful. Like another reader who has posted a review, I first read this novel in high school. Not only is it a  beautifully written, evocative novel, but in the wider  perspective it contains a valuable lesson about  historical perspective. What would the pre-Christians say,  if we could hear their words today? This book offers an  answer.

0393314804|5.0|People keep comparing this book to &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, but I'd throw in &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot;, yet perhaps with more heart and pathos than any of those. Also an outstanding example of how dialect can work in the hands of a skillfull writer
0844660736|5.0|I think this book is really the best book I ever read. It is both interesting and funny. I have read all of Gerald Durrell's book and this is my  favorite. Another lovely book by the same author  is &quot;The Bafut Beagles&quot;.
006091307X|5.0|Immediately interesting and continuously funny, The Crying of Lot 49 ascends into that small Pantheon of modern American classics.  Full of eccentric characters  and set against the backdrop of an expanding suburban west,  Pynchon displays a tremendous affinity for showing us America  (at its most mediocre) and making us laugh at what we see.  As herione Oedipa Maas travels up and down the Californian coast,  attempting to uncover a bizarre conspiracy, she unravels  a new reality that challenges us to question ours.  With each re-reading, the books yields new meaning, a testament of Pynchon's deep understanding of language.  Driven by  humor but full of thought, The Crying of Lot 49 is truly a sparkling and fresh novel.

If you read<br /> this book and don't smell the sex and used liquor and diesel<br /> fuel from the passing ships and the pastries and sea food in<br /> the air of New Orleans, you must forget the stuff you learned<br /> from Evelyn Woods.  Savor this again now that the images have<br /> fermented for a decade and a half.
0312857063|3.0|I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this book.   T. Goodkind lost the art of combining dialog with  horrifying violence with a purpose going toward an unforseen   yet sensible outcome.  His characters just went a little nuts.   It seemed like the ending was disjointed and left a   lot of details out that needed to be there.  I hope TG gets   back on track with the finale.
0441003257|5.0|If either author has ever appealed, read this and snigger. Giving new life to the &quot;The Omen&quot; story of Apocalypse Soon, and avoiding the worst excesses of both authors, Good Omens is very, very funny. At times, the individual authors styles seem to risk creeping out and overwhelming the book, but overall this is a surprisingly cohesive and charming tale guaranteed to bring out the (devils) child in anyone
0848813618|5.0|Many of us found Hesse when we were searching youngsters,<br />filled with a longing that Western thought failed to fill<br />(yes, this was before the Reagan years, before crass materialism<br /> seemed to fill the spiritual void for so many waylaid Americans)<br /> Go back and reread this marvellous story of the Buddha, told<br /> in loving and respectful prose by this German master. It<br /> stands the test of time well, and opens up the door to a<br /> different way of viewing reality, as told in lyrical and<br /> loving language. There's a reason this book speaks to youth<br /> who are longing: it's elegant, simple, and rings with truth.
0312853238|1.0|The most intriguing thing about Ender's Game is trying to figure out why it receives raves.  The backbone of the plot can be explained in a sentence and while it  might have supported a short story (the resolution  of the story is predictable half way through)  it's too flimsy a frame for a novel.  The  no-gray-zone series of leadership-lesson episodes read like Card wrote a story to the  table of contents in a US Army basic training  manual.  My only explanation for the book's popularity is  that it hit a sweet spot of readers with their hands on  the joystick,   hungry for a rationalization  fantasy for the hours and quarters that they  squander in video game parlors mastering   Missile Command.
0553346687|5.0|I was checking on this book because I just recommended it as an acquisition for the library at the community colllege where I teach.  The book describes the life of a brilliant Nobel Prize-winning physicist, and shows him as a completely accessible human being.  He gives a marvelously entertaining account of some of the experiments he conducted while a college undergraduate - all of them completely understandable to a layperson.  But the book continues through his adult life: his attempts to learn Japanese, his experiences as a patron and legal defender of a local strip club, his encounters with military stuffed shirts during WWII, and dozens of other adventures.  If you want to convince yourself or someone else that it's possible to be a brilliant scientist and a real human being simultaneously, then this is the book.  Both as entertainment and as information, it's a smashing success

0887307876|5.0|Excellent book for employees and bosses - there may even be some real (scary) wisdom between the cartoons.  On days that life in the office is getting you down, or if you ever fear you're taking life in the office too seriously, this book is a sure antidote.  And, laughter is after all, the best medicine.
0345350499|5.0|This is not a typical Marion Zimmer Bradley book.  Although I've enjoyed all of her books, this is the one I've lost over 10 times &quot;lending&quot; it out to friends who never returned  it.  I have to keep re-buying it, since it stands up so well  to repeated reading.  The Arthur legend has been retold so  many times, but never like this.  Forget the other versions.
0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is a traveller's travel writer. Not content to  follow well-worn tourist trails, he blazes his way across  nations by the seat of his pants.  This is no dry,   philosophical tome on travel and its affect on the psyche,   or an author attempting to 'find himself' while on a daring  journey.  No, this is the story of Bill Bryson stumbling his   way across Europe, encountering all manner of misery, joy,   and hilarity along the way. Written in an uproariously funny,  conversational tone, 'The Lost Continent' will make your sides  ache with laughter as you read (and re-read) it.
1573225517|5.0|WOW!!  This book examines love, heartbreak and rejection in such a clear concise way that you realize that Mr. Hornby has finally articulated, and beautifully, the buzz of feelings in your heart and head.  I give this book to all my friends.  I eagerly look forward to his next book
038072216X|5.0|This book quite ably demonstrates the stoic foundations of both Buddhism and Christianity.  To the reader who carefully reads it and follows its principles it offers both clarity  of vision and inner peace.  Regardless of your religion, it  would be difficult for this philosophy to violate any of its  precepts.  The dominate themes of love, forgiveness,   non-judgement, and lack of condemnation found in both Buddhism   and Christianity texts are stressed without any pretenses of  understanding the after-life.
0425107469|5.0|By far my favorite book of all time.  I was gripped from the first chapter many years ago, and the characters have become a part of me.  This sounds odd, but  Koont'z characters in this book seem so real that life seems a disappointment when you put the book down.  By far the best of Dean's works, I reccommend this to all friends, family and even strangers such as yourself
0679416781|5.0|This was a Booker Prize winner (1992?).  I was prepared to dislike it--seemed a little too introspective for my tastes (not to mention I usually avoid WWII stories).  What a pleasant, if unsettling, surprise; this book is marvelous.  The writing is sensuous, the characters dramatic, and the setting surreal. The book opens with Hana, the war-fatigued nurse, left behind (by her choice) after the evacuation of the Allies from Italy.  She has seen so much death and so much devastation that she cannot move on with her fellow nurses.  She throws away her uniform and cuts off her hair and settles  in to finish the war in her own way.   Hana is caring for a man she presumes is English, but who is so badly burned that he has no identifying features.  He is an encyclopedia of knowledge of Bedouins and the desert; he quotes from Herodotus frequently, and he has thorough understanding political forces behind the war.  He cannot move but is dependent on Hana to relieve his pain, feed him, and read endlessly to him.  The Italian thief Carravaggio hears tell of the young nurse who refused to leave with the evacuees and realizes she is the daughter of a former friend; he joins her and the patient in the villa, initially out of concern for Hana's well being, and later stays out of compulsion to discover the identity of the patient (which he does).  Incidentally, Carravaggio has had his thumbs cut off for theft and is a morphine addict.  Kip, a Sikh sapper from Lahore, arrives to do his job--finding and defusing Nazi mines and bombs.  He and Hana become romantically involved, but this touchingly described part of the book truly is an incidental part.  Kip is so far from home, so young, and so confused about life that he immerses himself into his treacherous work.  He compares much of his life to his job--what harm can lightening be, when he runs the risk of being blown up several times a day?  He keeps himself isolated from the others as much as he can, to the point of sleeping in atent outside, but like the other characters, he is dependent on the others to find himself.  The story of each character is lovingly told; even the most gruesome vignettes are told with words to wrap yourself in and just roll around.  And although nothing in this book could be classified as too pleasant, the book is immensely satisfying.  I finished it with a modest &quot;Oh, my!&quot;

0679736646|5.0|Ubik is Philip K. Dick's wonderfully satiric look at reality, psychic abilities, and advertising.  The book follows the trials of the members of Glen Runciter's company as they try and figure out who died in a bomb blast.  Things are never as they seem as various members try and understand what happened.  Dick again crafts a truly unique story that is full of wit and discussion on the nature of reality.  He also pokes fun at advertising as the characters search for the mystical substance Ubik- the cure for all of their worries.  Dick manages to keep the reader guessing and involved pretty well.  There are times when things get very confusing, but rest assured all makes sense by the end.  This review, like Ubik, has been informative and safe if read as directed
0380002930|5.0|I have read many, many books.....varied in nature, and this  is singularly the most enchanting and mesmerizing one ever. My mother, who passed away 13 years ago, had told me over  and over that I would love this book.  It took a stranger  recommending it to remind me that she had so wanted me  to read and enjoy it.  It is the only book that I have ever  finished one day and immediately started rereading the next. If you don't love this book, you are missing out on some  magic in your life!
0679760911|3.0|I have read &quot;Ella Imagina&quot; and  &quot;Tonto, muerto, bastardo e invisible&quot; and this last one &quot;El desorden de tu nombre&quot; was a real dissappointment. It is easilly read, but it is a very predictable book.
0380715430|5.0|Written in an engagingly familiar way, but full of informative and interesting facts about the complexities of English.  Essential for anyone who has an innate curiosity interest about the origins of the way much of the world's population speaks and writes
044022165X|5.0|A fast pace page turner. The story is simple but Grisham wrote it in such a way that the suspense kept readers on the edge of their seats. The ending is predictable, as in many other fictions, but it is still worth the readers' time to finish the book. Real life lawyers might find the story a little difficult to believe but for the general readers, don't miss it.
0345373243|5.0|This is an excellent book written by David and Leigh  Eddings.  This book fills in the gaps of information left out  of the previous two series, the BELGARIAD and the MALLOREAN.   This book recounts the tales of the ages before the events of   the other two series through the eyes of Belgarath the    Sorcerer.  This book is intended to be read after the other   two series, since much of the finer details will be missed by   someone new to the series.<br />    This is also the first book to feature David Eddings'    wife Leigh, as an author.  In the beginning of the book, Eddings'   explains that she was always an author, but never recognized.<br />    All in all, this is a great book.  To anyone who has    read the first two series and feels unsatisfied with the explanations   of anything, or to anyone who wants to know more about Gods,   or the brotherhood of sorcerers, or even the beginning of empires, this is the book to read.
0385470819|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books, and this one is by far the best. The characters and situations are captivating and exciting
0345406680|5.0|AS always WWII for one who dadn't directly experience it, looms myth-like in clearness of intent. Perhaps without extraordinary language the story shines brighter in it's testinment to our humanity.  The authors objects are aways clear that he didn't undertake this voyage for a noble reason but for a precious gift of understanding oneself.  I stayed up all night, granted I don't sleep well,  this book make me glad of the insomnia
0345350499|5.0|_The Mists of Avalon_ is one of my top five favorite books  of all time.  For me, this has become the true story of the  legend of King Arthur.  It is told through the eyes of all   the women, but mostly through the eyes of Morgaine (Morgan   La Fey), Arthur's half sister.  Other Arthurian stories make   her out to be pure evil.  Here Morgaine presents her point   of view (as well as that of the other major women).  And   what a fine job she does of it.  The story pulls you in and   the pages just fly by.  Bradley draws her characters with   such detail that I felt strongly one way or another about   almost every one of them.  I have never been so sad when the   book came to an end and I had to leave this incredible world.    I recommend it every chance I get. It's a magical experience.
0316920045|4.0|You can read the rest of the reviews for a discussion of the plot, characters, etc., but the way I read it best describes  it.  I used it as a soporific at night, and eventually got to   the point where like an addictive sleeping pill, I couldn't   skip a night without tossing and turning.  I have eighty pages   to go, and I'm beginning to worry about what will happen   when I have to go cold turkey.  Maybe like an earlier reviwer,  I'll have to maintain the addiction and read it again, looking   for the seeds and stems.
0821221841|5.0|Einstein wrote a book for lay people to explain the  theory of relativity.  I've read it twice, and I still don't know what Albert's talking about.  Ansel Adams wrote   three books on photography, The Camera, The Negative, and  The Print, for lay people to explain how to take   good photographs.  I've read 'em all, and at least  I know what Ansel's talking about, even if I can't take  photographs like his yet (gimme fifty years of practice).  Whether you like Adams' style or not, in technique, he  is to photography what Einstein is to physics: a single  authoritative master who's work can be relied upon.    Of the three books, _The Negative_ is the most important;   but if you are just getting started, the Camera is   where to begin.
0425152251|5.0|I was so impressed with this book that I went out and immediately bought twelve copies and shipped them to friends all over the country so they could share the experience with me.    The history of philosophy interspersed throughout this book is amazingly accessible and thoroughly readable.  The plot within a plot within a plot engages the reader from the very first page driving you on to find out what will happen next to the incredible cast of characters.    My only regret is that I will never be able to have the experience of reading this book for the first time again
0060925000|5.0|I throughly enjoyed Seth's A Suitable Boy.  He follows the story of Lata, a young Indian woman whose mother feels is  now ready to marry.  What Lata will have to face is whether  she will marry for love or marry the man chosen by her   family.  Seth combines romance with the history, politics  and religion of India to make a very enjoyable glimplse of  life for this young woman and the people around her.  While  Lata is the focus of the story, he has several side stories  that help to give a better picture of their life in India   and of the complexity of the decision that Lata faces.  I   found it very difficult to put this book down at times and   once missed my train stop because of it.  I highly recommend  to those who would like to learn about India and enjoy a   good story in the process.
1559723505|4.0|Through solid research and observations made in her own therapy practice, Dr. Aron uncovers the facts about being highly sensitive. It does not mean being a crybaby, a 90-pound weakling or a scaredy-cat but rather possessing a sensitive nervous system -- an inherited biological trait. This book is about the 15 to 20f us who experience life at one end of the human spectrum. Highly Sensitive People (HSPs) process sensory input more finely and to deeper levels than average.Being aware of subtleties in your surroundings can be a great advantage. It may also mean that stimulating environments can bombard an HSP's system until s/he is exhausted. This trait, like any other, clearly has advantages and disadvantages.Dr. Aron addresses the impact of cultural ideals on the life experiences of HSPs by examining learned coping behaviors, common experiences and the self esteem struggles of those who have been constantly chastised to \\"toughen up.\\" While providing practical advice on crafting a lifestyle that is suited to helping an HSP thrive, this book covers social interaction, career choices, personal health, gender issues and spiritual matters. For those struggling to survive in an aggressive culture that devalues the subtle abilities so central to the nature of an HSP, Dr. Aron has written an thoughtful, helpful, non-judgmental examination of ourselves. Parents, teachers and therapy professionals should also read this book. Don't despair, The Highly Sensitive Person is scheduled to be reprinted in paperback by the end of 1996.
0140185232|5.0|I think I may have made a tactical error the other day when I told my boss that my career goal was to win the lottery.  But last week I read The Razor's Edge and ever since I've been wondering what made me think that work was so important.  Here's the story:  Larry Darrell is a changed man when he returns to Chicago after serving in World War I.  During the war he witnesses the death of a good friend and comes to the inescapable conclusion that life is too precious to waste.  Armed with this insight, he alarms his friends, family and fiancee when he turns down the plum job and heads to Europe to begin the great adventure of his life.  From the coal mines of southern France to a lama's monastery on a mountain top in Tibet, Larry Darrell steadfastly resists the pressure to succumb to the societal norms of money and career and instead pursues the meaning of life with a single-minded intensity and a touch of grace.  So how are you going to live your life?  Have you had that gnawing feeling lately, as you are working through your 20's and 30's, that you may have unwittingly entered into a Faustian bargain?  Have you ever considered trading in the ordinary for the extraordinary?  These are questions that we all face and ones that are explored with great insight and skill by W. Somerset Maugham in The Razor's Edge.  And with great humor too--not for nothing was it made into a surprisingly good movie starring Bill Murray as Larry Darrell.  So forget about the 12-step programs, the books that tell you how to get along with people you'd rather not get along with and send your inner child to bed.  Check out The Razor's Edge.  Just don't tell your boss what you've been up to.  Oh what the heck, tell the boss.  It would make Larry Darrell smile and who knows, it might make you happy too
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the most riveting and moving sf novel I  have ever read. For me, it was impossible to put down and never  rang a false note. The ending gave me goosebumps. I believe   that this book is the standard against   which all pure sf should be measured. (Fortunately I do not   write pure sf myself, but as a new  novelist I'm both awestruck and jealous of Orson Scott Card for having  written such an amazing story.)  James Halperin
0393039102|5.0|In this work of Eric Lomax, one finds direct contrasts between brutality and meekness, revenge and forgiveness. The author was a signals officer in the Pacific Theater of the war and  was captured after the fall of Singapore. He was then sent to  the POW camps involved in the construction of the then Siam-  Burma railway (Remember the &quot;Bridge Over the River Kwai&quot;?).  There he had first-hand experience of the Japanese's brutal  treatment of POWs, himself included. He never forgot the face  of the Japanese interpreter accompanying the soldier who beat  him to a pulp. He narrates how he had to cope psychologically  with normal life after the war, how his wartime experiences  kept on haunting him. Coincidentally, he chances upon some  information regarding a Japanese trying to make reparations  for his wartime brutalities, and indeed confirms that this  was his former tormentor. After a lot of soul-searching, he  finally meets the Japanese in a war memorial beside the Kwai  River bridge, and the process of reconciliation and healing  begins. A very touching story of man's capacity to perhaps  not to forget, but yes, to forgive.
0060171928|1.0|<br /> Although the pro-ecology message in the book is good, I have serious doubts as to the authenticity of the story. I am an Australian, I lived in the bush with Aboriginal people when I was a boy. I studied Aboriginal art, history and material culture at University and I now work in a programme devoted to training Aboriginal people. These people are my friends, I know them. <br /> This book reads like one of the 18th century travel novels, i.e Gulliver's Travels etc.. Not in the quality of the written word but in the vagueness of the tale and details. The country that is said to be Australia could be any ex-colonial nation. The people could be native American or African. The details of Aboriginal culture that are thrown in are clinical in a way that makes me think they were copied from the same texts I studied from. <br /> The lack of any place names, store names etc, those little details that mark the quality travel books, is explained away by a need to protect the &quot;real people&quot;. The folk law seems to be a synthasis of many different indiginous cultures I have studied. <br /> What I am getting at is I believe that this book is a misrepresentaion of the Aboriginal people, and is basicaly a money making exersize aimed at the retro hippy market and city dwelling Americans who want to touch something a bit primative and mystical. <br /> It could have been written by anyone who has a fleeting knowledge of Australia and a passing interest in the Aboriginal people and a good reference library. In fact I could have written it myself, and inserted some stories from my Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander friend to spice it up a bit. <br /> If you have to read it, read it as a work of fiction (the library of congress thinks it is). <br /> In conclusion <br />The pro ecology messege is admirable, but the use of the Aboriginal people and the misrepresentation of Australia is deplorable

I discovered I have some women traits and it helpmed me to learn more about myself and how I can improve my working and pesonal relationships with women.

0441003257|5.0|Neil Gaiman's extraordinary storytelling abilities combined with Terry Pratchett's sense of humor makes this the funniest book you will ever read.  To merge two great talents into something even greater  is the hardest thing to do.  But Gaiman and Pratchett's many phonecalls over the atlantic  ocean payed off big time.  If you want a great story and a thousand laughs this is  the book for you.  If not, why do you read books?

0345373243|5.0|Contrary to most expectations, I did not read Eddings' Belgariad and Malloreon series first.  I had always been turned off by the sheer number of books in each series.  How good could they be? <BR> When Belgarath the Sorceror came out, I took the opportunity to get a feel for Eddings' work without having to plunge into the entire series.  While I missed a lot of the &quot;present time&quot; references, I still thought the book was fantastic.  Over the next two weeks, I read the entire Belgariad and Malloreon, then went back and re-read Belgarath with a whole new appreciation. <BR> This series is not to be missed by any fan of Feist, Brooks, or Goodkind

0553275569|5.0|I first read &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; over 10 years ago and I<br />typically re-read the book every two years.  Tom Wolfe has<br />produced one of the best looks at manned flight starting<br /> from 1947 and the breaking of the &quot;sound barrier&quot; up to the<br /> end of Project Mercury.<br /><br />  The chapters are well thought out, from the beginning in<br /> which we learn that the mortality rate for test pilots in<br /> the 1950's was 24%(!!) to the chapter that explains why all<br /> airline pilots sound alike, to the description of Chuck<br /> Yeager losing control of a Starfighter at over 100,000 feet.<br /><br />  I cannot recommend this book too strongly.<br /><br />  Dave Zechiel
0060922583|5.0|Talbot presents a new, exciting and plausible paradigm of the mind and universe. His arguments are logical, well presented, and based on the very latest findings in science. Through many examples, he illustrates how what are considered inviolate laws of the universe are broken regularly. The reader is drawn to the conclusion that all things are possible, and limitaions are of our own making
0385424736|2.0|The weakest of Grisham's stories, this one reads as if it was written to be the Sunday night &quot;made for tv&quot; special --- doesn't even make the big screen! The character development leaves us with nothing more than caricatures. And the  only satisfying part about the ending was that the story was over.
0679416781|5.0|I once worked in a thriving bookstore whose primary source of sales came from romance novels.  I mean cheap, tawdry, breath- less stuff with Fabio on the cover; I couldn't bring myself to  read more than two pages without laughing.  It was a shame,  too, because I'm as romantic as the next person.  SO imagine   my shock of delight when I ran across a REAL romance, with  images that resonate as deep as an ocean, written in English  that best represents the state of modern literature.  Canadian  Michael Ondaatje's lyrical and disturbing tale of four wounded  lives at the close of World War II and the memories of loss and  hope that flicker across the pages is a book to be read out loud,  a book that inspires through its sheer force of poetry.  It has  all of the intrigue and wonder of a romance, but without the  guilt; this is a tale of love for adults.  Forget those nice  little novellas about geriatric passion and read passages that  can illuminate corners of your mind, those opinions that scoff   at such silly matters as those of the heart.  Ondaatje won  England's Booker Prize (equivalent to our National Award or  Pulitzer) for his work, and it was well-deserved.  He doesn't  condescend or cheapen emotions to snare an audience, instead  he lets the story unfold in layers until we've come to learn  more about these people: a nurse, a thief, a soldier, and a   terribly disfigured English patient; as if we've lived along  with them.  A stunning, welcome example of the very best moder  fiction has to offer.  And... there's no bare-chested male  models gracing the cover!  &quot;The English Patient,&quot; by Michael  Ondaatje.  Makes a great Xmas gift for the hopeless romantic  in your life.  (I hear it's being made into an epic film at the end of 1996,  so you can be among the elect who can say how great the book  was.)
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is a beautiful story.  The adventures of a few rabbits  from Sandleford Warren is told with great interest and much character.  It is purely a classic and deserves a perfect 10!  Hazel, the leader   of a group of outcast rabbit, leads the party trying to make the right   decisions to keep them safe.  They faced perilous dangers and must   learn to get along.  Together they make it to their new home, but what  will happen next as they face the dreaded General Woundwart and his   Warren?  It's all in this epic tale of leadership, heart, and bravery.  It will surely dazzle the hearts that are touched by this book.
0887307876|5.0|An amazing collection of the foibles and predilictions of the modern business world.  It extends, amplifies, and corrects the concepts presented in the Peter Principle. Workers after rising to their level of incompentence are promoted into management where they will cause less harm. The book is a compilation of incidents observed and made known to Scott combined with appropriate Dilbert cartoons.  I could not put the book down but was afraid to let it be seen in my cubicle.
0192815342|5.0|This book leads you down a path into a world of mystery, suspense, and romance.

Read this book
0374266425|5.0|I found this book both incredibly easy to understand, and surprisingly complex. It started out slow but interesting, and quickly became more and more compelling.  The way that the two people's lives slowly became entwined really got to   me...I found myself wondering who existed and who didn't. The story left me   with many questions, both about the book and myself. I would recommend it to   anyone who was willing to read about such a confusing topic.
0553103547|5.0|This is among the best books I've read in recent times;<br />both within and outside the genre.  The characters are<br />believable and multi-dimensional.

0679745203|5.0|Open the book and you are plunged into another world, peopled by shattered humans who will rouse you from the complacent present, and draw you inexorably to their world of suffering and (sometimes) redemption. Filled with incredible details, written with grace and knowledge, you cannot help but be caught up in the lives of these mysterious survivors. There is much to learn in these pages, and Ondaatje is a marvelous teacher. The story flows seamlessly along until the last few pages. There it unaccountably falls off track, into an incongruous jeremiad against racism, which contains a vital message, but seems artless and contrived. The ending in no way detracts from the grand achievement of the book, which will linger in your heart for years

Though I have read this book  several times before, and loved it, this past time, I took  my time reading it.  Though it took me about two weeks, I  read every word, and was really able to take in the perfection   of Richard Adam's work.  This is to date the most wonderful   work I have ever read.

0440133688|5.0|As an Intern in my first year of residency training, what Shem writes about is at times familiar, comfortable, and occasionally, outrageous. Although medicine has changed dramatically in the years between which Shem wrote this book, he touches a common thread which all physicians face during this pivotal time in their careers. Deep down, his story embodies the human struggle for acceptance and understanding in the complex field of medicine. On the other hand, the cynicism he presents should ask us to examine all physicians as what they truly are - fellow human beings - with all  the foibles and fallacies that this condition entails

0452273331|5.0|<br />Perhaps a few hundred years from now, critics , students and teachers of history and literature will recount this book with great passion and the effect that it had on the people of the 20th century who read it. <br /> The Book sets out to prove a single point and in the authors own words it is: &quot;Man's Ego is the Fountainhead of Human Progress&quot;.<br /> A Man who stands for himself and what he beleives in usually stands alone. That is the way to live, the reason for creation and the only human morality.  Ayn Rand in this book defines the true meaning of human ego and what it takes to be a true egotist. A good thing &quot;ego&quot;, not a bad one.  <br />I for one is someone who has read the book and for the most part beleive in it's presentation, conclusion and application of the ideas presented in the book in real life.  Whether or not you fully agree with the principles presented in the book, it is a must read if you fulfill one criteria.. you must be a human
0451167716|5.0|This is by far the greatest book I have ever read, blowing<br />away any &quot;Great American Novel&quot; or Shakespearean play for<br />both depth of plot and riviting story line.<br /><br /> In addition to it's pop culture standing as the difinitive<br /> title concerning mafia life, this book teaches valuable<br /> life-lessons as applicable in New York's rough streets as<br /> in the Heartland.  Puzo's definition of family and duty are<br /> among the most valid and vivid since Vergil.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card's novel, Ender's Game, is one of the most  exhilaraiting books that I have ever read.  Not only does it  draw you into the life of an amazingly bright child who must   save the world, but it captures you in a world that is unknown  and mystifing to the common man.  This is definately one of   the greatest science fiction novels ever written.
0807106577|5.0|My brother, whose library generally begins and ends with accounting, medical journals, and organic gardening tomes, recommended this book to me.  Reluctantly, I read it as he kept asking me if I had.  AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE.  Which goes to prove that truly great books transcend all things -- even the abyss between a liberal arts major and a CPA/physician/farmer!  I laughed aloud countless times.  It is a shame that the author did not live to see his success, but somewhere I know he has the angels in stitches
0380002930|5.0|Don't let the title mislead you.This is not Tom Clancey's latest novel about the Red October sinking. It is though just as exciting an adventure as you would hope to read.This extremely well written book corcerning a group of rabbits and thier variety of animal and human friends and enemies is throughly absorbing.It should plant the seed of imagination for both adults and children alike
0345350499|2.0|I feel like I'm swimming against the tide writing a  negative review of this book,  but in all honesty I  didn't really enjoy it.  I found the characters to be   very one-dimensional.  All of the Christians were stupid,   dull and brutish.  All of the goddess worshippers were   gentle, wise and interesting (unless they became Christians   in which case they became stupid, dull and brutish).    The idea of writing an Arthurian romance from a women's   perspective was a good one, and some of Ms. Bradley's  twisting of the legend was well done, so I haven't given  it the lowest review.  However, I certainly wouldn't  recommend it to my friends, or be tempted to reread it.   In the future I'll stick with Mallory for King Arthur,   and with Katherine Kurtz for fantasy.

0385424736|4.0|Grishams experience of struggling through law school was so accurate that it brought back a flood of my own memories of school.  Willing to take jobs no matter how sleezy they were.  For anyone who has dealt with an Insurance company, this novel brought back very vivid memories of dealing with the slimmest business in the world.  The struggle and conflict of the main character gave you moments of joy, sadness, fear, and anxiety.  John Grisham had is very best novel, in my mind, until he gave up on the novel to meet a deadline.  Meet a Deadline, is the only excuse I can come up with for the lame ending of this novel.  In the ending, the main character, who would be fine role model for any attorney to acheive, kills a man.  Come on Grisham, you are my favorite author, ask for the book back from the publisher so you can rewrite the ending.  Either that, or give back part of the $6 million given for the novel, or better yet send me a check for $25, the cost I paid for the worst ending of any novel you have written

0793518326|5.0|This book is an amazing collection of Beatles Scores.  Every song the Beatles recorded is included here, including the early Rock and Roll covers.  The scores are transcribed exactly as recorded, including Guitar tabulature, altered tunings, piano parts, and string parts.  Occasionally large sections are reduced to a single staff, such as the orchestral part in A Day in the Life.  Each song is prepared by hand yet the look is entirely readable, and beautifully done.    If you are a musician interested in Rock music, this book is a must.  Definitely worth its $60+ pricetag.
0553278355|5.0|I don't often cry because of the power of a book.The Bell Jar, however, is no ordinary book.  From thebeginning, in her Salinger-esque style, Sylvia Plath traces the tortured downward spiral of her own soul, the story made ever-so-much more effective by the heartwrenching true tale of her own suicide. A wonderful book, suitable for the young, the old, and  everywhere in between; NOT, however, for those afraid to reflect on their own depths and faults, and those of society.                                  -Anthony Gabriele
0440217563|5.0|The anticipation for this book had almost crippled me.  When I was finally able to read it, I couldn't put it down.  The immense amount of history that is contained in Diana's books, are absolutely breathtaking.  Her descriptions take me from my home straight to Claire and Jamie.  When reading a historical novel I sometimes skim the paragraphs before the interesting information, but with Diana's books I read every word, every paragraph and digested it as a rare and exotic meal.  From the moment I opened Outlander to the time I closed Voyager, I have lived in another world.  I am sure that my husband was very thankful for the hiatus.  Bravo Diana!  Encore!  Your devoted reader, Nedr
0060171936|5.0|Ms. Morgan found herself in the Austrailan Outback with a tribe of Aborigines on the adventure of a lifetime.  For 4 months she lived with this particular tribe as they prepared her to receive from them their many secrets.   At the end, she had learned many things about the tribe and herself.  She became more like them and was constantly amazed at the things she was learning.  In the end, she was given many secrets of the tribe, which spoke to many problems in the world and the need for them to be addressed.  They selected this particular author, because of work that she was doing with other Aborigines in Austrailia and they thought that she would be a good person to spread their message.  She learned a lot and I did to just from reading the book.  Enjoy

This is a book that I could not put down, I had to know what was going to happen to two people I already genuinely cared about.   Not withstanding, the rich historical content of this novel by itself is obviously painstakingly researched and I find my self learning many things about Scottish history.  I am eagerly awaiting the book, Drums of Autumn, due out in January of 1997
0312853238|5.0|The intersteller battle domes, the armies of teens and children, and the brilliant aray of technology incorperate together to make one of the best books for adults and  children written this decade.

0060920084|5.0|As an avid &quot;road-tripper&quot; across the United States, I found Bryson'a account to be both accurate and hysterically funny at the same time. My husband and I actually spent several weeks reading chapters aloud to one another each night before going to sleep. I passed the book on to several friends who had not travelled to many of the places Bryson explores, but who came back to me with high praises nevertheless. For anyone who truly appreciates the distinctly different flavors of our nation's cities and regions, this book is a pure treasure. Thanks to Bryson, those of us who have been to Des Moines, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, can relive many of our own observations at the time. And, for those who haven't been to all these places yet, Bryson seems to give just enough description to make you desire to experience it all first hand. Delightful
0887307876|5.0|Scott Adams has reviewed the Peter Principle and put it in  context for today's world. What is more he keeps up the  tradition of Northcote Parkinson by teaching us how to   become managers, and keeping it outrageously funny. This is   not a book about becoming an effective manager. It is all   about becoming a successful manager. And it's all about  workplace situations we all know so well.   I first read a few pages of the book at Barnes and Noble  and soon attracted stares from all around when I was  rolling in the aisles, doubled up with laughter.

0380002930|5.0|I first read this book when I was a teen, reread it in my early twentys, again a few years later, and most reciently, at the age of 42.  Each time, a new discovery, and new feeling of triumph.  It has been at the top of that &quot;must read&quot; list that exhists in every avid readers mind, the list that every new aquaintance must listen to at least once.  The list that starts &quot;Oh, if you like to read you MUST read.....&quot;  Always number one on my list since that first accidental discovery (It was a last minute grab in the school library as the bell rang..) Watership Down has given me untold hours of pleasure, both in the reading and rereading, as well as the sharing.

0446310786|5.0|In the scene where Atticus leaves the courtroom and the child ren are told to rise in their father's honor along with the black people, I tear up everytime.  I find it to be a quiet  memorial to his diligence in the name of justice, truth,   honesty, dignity and the equality of all.  It is a show of re  spect for a man of immense honor and fairness.  It is an act  of quiet desperation in the face of overwhelming injustice,  prejudice, racism and bigotry.  It is all they can give to him  but it speaks volumes.  I share the novel each year with my   10th grade students and each year, they say, &quot;I love this book&quot;.  I am honored to be in the presence of students who perhaps for  the first time in their lives &quot;feel&quot; the injustice and prejudice  that far too many prople have been subjected to for numerous  reasons.  I also love the evolving maturity and love in the  unusual Finch family.  I see the family representing many feel  ings that are unspoken in my students' eyes.  Through the eyes   of Scout and out of the mouth of a babe we see and hear about  our educational and judical system.  We see prejudice, love,  family, neighborhood, life, death, mystery, uniqueness, kind  ness, hatred, ignorance, mistrust.  We feel the depth and  breadth of emotion.  It is a story worth telling, reading, dis  cussing more than once.  When Scout says &quot;Heh, Boo.&quot;  She sees  inside of him.  She sees the inner man and looks beyond the   exterior delivering the message to all of us....&quot;Heh, Boo.&quot;&quot;
1568490119|5.0|My therapist lent me this book to read at a time of crisis in which I had no sense of self-worth. I was suicidal. There were many instances descibed in this book where I found similarities in my emotional make-up although my sufferings were no where near that dramatic and &quot;hopeless&quot;.  In the words of Nietzsche : &quot;He who has a WHY to live for can bear any HOW,&quot; I found peace within chaos.  Although I did not understand some of the more difficult arguments, the book set me on the path to find  my own meaning of life and the courage to live. I think that the meaning of life need not be one thing or   action but can be several but I can only think of one thing now. The meaning of my life now is to  touch the people I know or care about in the most tender and deep way I know how. And to see them happy even  for a brief moment by what I do for them is quite enough. And everyday is a new day and there is opportunity  me to do something positive in my own ways.

0393312836|5.0|A dark, disturbing, and fully engrossing novel that is unlike anything ever written. Its colorful use of language, imagery, philosophizing, and gruesome detail is used in liberal doses throughout, and an exceptional and coherent story shines through a complex surface.  I have to say the bottom of the book is engaging, and horrific.  With precision, care, and great imagination, Burgess has created a tale that is dark, grim, yet undeniably brilliant
0679416781|5.0|This is the most poetically written book I've read in years. His writing stimulates the imagination and senses, taking you on the journey with him. You can feel the breezes, smell the smoke, taste the blood and tears. Highly stimulating and thought provoking. From the bombed out ruins of Europe  to the tragedy and desperation of the desert, you encounter the emotions of the Englishman's existence. A must read for late nights.
0452270073|5.0|This first novel of a trilogy of World War I is the most powerful although it was the last one, Ghost Road, which won the prestigious Booker Prize.  The setting is a hospital in England for those recovering from shell shock. The protagonists are a psychiatrist and his patient who is opposed to the endless slaughter of the war. Clearly to &quot;cure&quot; the patient, to find him sane, is to send him to his probable death.    The entire novel takes place within the hospital yet the horror of this  war is omnipresent, the images sharp and overwhelmingly strong and sad. It is an amazing book because of the author's ability to portray the horror of war without being in the battlefield and the permanent scars left on the psyche.    Interestingly this novel has been built on the foundation of meetings between real people. I found this book irresitible and memorable, and immediately read the rest of the trilogy, but it is this one that is haunting.
0205191584|5.0|Many books about writing are huge, but &quot;The Elements<br />of Style,&quot; the best of them, is extremely short: 92 pages,<br />including index. Read them all. Briefly and vigorously,<br /> Strunk and White will tell you, for example, when to use<br /> (and not to use) commas, which words to avoid, how to divide<br /> paragraphs, and generally how to pare your writing down to<br /> essentials.

0060175184|5.0|This book started out with the end and then explained why, an effective technique that is well used here.  The plot is about 2 media empires and how they were built: by &quot;monsters&quot;, who did anything to get their way.  By portraying the monsters first as boys growing up, we get to see how they changed and became the powerful figures as adults.  Every scene is related to something that happens later, but because the men are immoral, only one side is presented.  We don't get to see any redeeming qualities of the man who is the worse of two evils, and the man who survives is only too glad to gobble up the empire of the one who fails.  That the two lead characters of the book closely parallel the actual lives of media moguls cannot be overlooked.  The problem is discerning what is fact from fiction.  Since the characters are so overwhelmingly immoral, it detracts from the being able to say &quot;so that's how it was.&quot;  I can understand why Robert Maxwell wanted to stop the book, it can't be all there is to know about him, nor about his competitor.  Overall, this is a minor drawback to a well-paced book about the real world and its power brokers
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is the first (and best) in a series about Ender, a young boy bred to be a leader in a society where more than two children is illegal. An alien race, insect-like possessing a hive mind (sound familiar? see The Madness Season), has attacked Earth, and we live in fear that they may strike again, even though it was decades ago. Ender, a child of the state, is drafted into this war, and he is forced to survive a bitter and difficult life in military school. His sister and brother (his brother Peter seems to be based on a popular killer, who dissected roadkill in his backyard), take over the Earth while he's away at war - an idea that's doesn't sound so silly when you read how they manipulate the internet society. True genius at work, Ender's greatest triumph and worst tragedy make for a powerful ending. Once you're done reading it, put it down and read something else unrelated - the rest of the series doesn't carry as much of a punch.

0140067477|5.0|If you're like me, you've never really understood the mystical and murky meanings of Eastern philosophies. I had that humanities class and all, but it never really sunk in while I was sitting in the lecture hall behind some giggling freshman. These amazingly simple  books have taught me the secrets of life and happiness. Well, not really, but they do  teach you the way to get through life without life getting to you. Better than the Stress  Ball and less expensive than a trip to a swanky health spa, it has been helpful to me. Hoff  explains Taoism through beloved characters from the Winnie-the-Pooh stories by A.A.  Milne. Yes, that's right, Pooh. I know it sounds weird, but it really works. These books  are very charming, funny, and witty. I now understand Taoist philosophy (I think), Pooh,  and Piglet better. I'm sure some Eastern philosophers are annoyed (or rolling over in their  graves) at these books, but, hey, it's the only way Americans are every gonna understand  it at all!  [...]

0679745203|4.0|The English Patient is a complex novel that interweaves four characters and their separate stories in a plot centered around WWII.  While the movie focuses on just one story attached to the present narrative, the book is much richer, fully developing all of the characters.  The main narrative creates a moving world of its own, as the characters find a safe haven from the war and their personal tragedies.  The novel can be difficult to follow, as the flashbacks to the characters' prior stories are not linear.  However, the difficulties are well worth the effort.  The English Patient is a book that will endure and inform

Most books are stories; here, Pynchon has transcended the written word to create a piece of art.  Read it and you will understand what I mean
0812550706|1.0|Before considering reading this, I think that one should look to Norman Spinrad's review of it as it appeared in Issac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. Failing that,  at least realize that the entire book is a deliberate   button-pushing saga, following the patterns of human  mythology that are older then history, in a completely  manipulative way. Read Frank Herbert and you'll see that he  wants to show the emptiness of the Messiah complex; Card  celebrates it. Herbert wants to explore what humanity is  about; Card wants to explore how much money it has.
0312853254|5.0|this book is an example of card's wonderful ability<br /> to use science fiction as a medium for exploring the human<br />'condition'. the characters are wonderful and the plot moves<br /> along swiftly... even if you aren't a fan of ender's game (which<br /> i most certainly am) you will find something to enjoy in this<br /> book.
0679441018|4.0|I thought that the style of writing for this book shows a greater maturity and it clearly shows that much more thought was given behind the philosophy behind good and evil and how things may not be so black and white.

0425107469|5.0|Watchers is about love, loneliness, fear, tragedy, the wrongs of genetic engineering/humans playing God, and, of course, horror and suspense. Watchers is about a man who has had a horrible  past, Travis Cornell, who thinks that anybody he gets close  to dies. It is also about Nora Devon, a woman who has been  kept isolated from the world by Aunt Violet, a character we  learn to hate. Also in the cast are a superintelligent dog,  a deadly human-made beast, a hitman, a lawyer, and two NSA  agents.  Watchers is by far one of the finest pieces of work ever  printed. Dean Koontz shows us that he is much more than a  horror/suspense writer. While keeping suspense at a maximum,  Koontz tells us a gripping tale about friendship. Some of the  characters are so charming that we wish they were real, while  some are just the scum of the earth.  Watchers pulses and overflows with Koontz's God-given talent  for suspense, humor, and flat-out great storylines. Read it  as soon as possible!
044651652X|1.0|After hearing all the hype, I picked it up. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. This has to be one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  The dialogue is forced, unreal and just plain boring. The storyline is less than romantic, simply another re-hash of the old farmer's wife and the milkman story.  I'm astounded that people are actually reading this drivel, never mind that so many actually find it remotely interesting
0812550706|5.0|I've read Ender's Game a number of times and it never ceases to impress me.  I'm not really even a sci-fi lover, but the writing, in its style, is impressive and Card creates characters rather than charicatures or parodies.  This book poses genuine questions without falling into the trap that some sci-fi does of making everything really &quot;futury&quot; and giving alternate names to every aspect of human life in the future.  It is a fine book
0679745203|5.0|<br />If you have only seen the movie the &quot;English Patient,&quot;  you do not know Michael Ondaatje's &quot;English Patient.&quot; <br />You do not truly know the extent of Hana's detachment from   the world around her and the reasons for that detachment,  you do not know of Carvaggio's previous life with Hana and  her father, and you do not know of the physically abusive   nature of the relationship between Katherine and Lladislaw.  <br />Most importantly, you have not read:  <br />  <br />&quot;A man in a desert can hold absence in his cupped hands  knowing it is something that feeds him more than water.&quot;  <br /> or  <br />&quot;Her life with others no longer interests him. He wants   only her stalking beauty, her theatre of expressions. He   wants the minute and secret reflection between them, the   depth of field minimal, their foreignness intimate like   two pages of a closed book.  <br />He has been disassembled by her.&quot;  <br />  <br />Finally, the curious involvement of Kip in their lives  becomes clearer when you know that Ondaatje himself is a Sri  Lankin (and, I believe, a Sikh).  <br />Do not deny yourself the majesty of this work because you  feel that you know its story. The telling rewards the reader  beyond the narrow reaches of its text.    <br />stuart gordon
0684874350|5.0|McCourt's Angela&quot;s Ashes is worth its weight in gold and I found it to be a good read but also informative about  history/religion and it's effect on our culture.    I gave the book to several senior's including  my mother who found the book too difficult because it made  them relive their poverty and many painful memories. To those  who have lost children or siblings through poverty you may  want to avoid this book because it is painful enough to  read without having to have gone through that experience  oneself.
0812548094|3.0|Although the plot was very well designed, and the characters very well fleshed out, something about the way goodkind writes seems to cast a pall over the whole book.  Not a very enjoyable effect Although he hadn't been the cheeriest of authors in Wizard's First Rule, somehow he got worse.  Still, if not easily downheartened by the general despair, it is a very good book to read.  I finished it in one continuous span of reading, just watch out for how your feeling at the end!
0812550706|5.0|I have read Ender's Game so many times I can't remember the first time.  My copy is so worn, and the cover creased.  It's a wonderful story.<br />  Ender is a wonderful character.  He has so many facets that you forget he's only a very young child.  It is invigorating to see someone so young battling against those a few years older than him, and those fifty years older than him, and winning at both.<br />  This story is a must read for anyone from age 12 to 112.  I highly recommend it.<br />
0312853238|5.0|This is the most exciting story I have read. I have owned  a half dozen copies, and keep mistakenly &quot;loaning&quot; them out to friends, never seeing this book again. Read it the first time  for the excitement of a story that you cannot put down. After  read it 5 more times like I have and learn more about human  nature and the dark subtle forces that drive us humans. Each  time I pick this book up to read, more I learn about who we are   and how easy we are to manipulate.

0385311400|5.0|I have read the other 3 but can't wait for the new &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot;. I have started a reading group at work (I provided the books, and everyone else reads) and you can guess which is the favorite series. One person  in the group has read them all in less than a week!  My order is in for  &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot;.  I can understand why it takes so long for each book  to come out, all you have to do is pay attention to the detail. I hope that  Diane writes for many, many years to come.
0312954468|5.0|As a classics major (and there aren't too many of us) I enjoyed this book tremendously. It doesn't seem like it has over 600 pages, it flows so quickly! I've read a large number of novels set in the ancient world, and this one ranks up there with I, Claudius and the earlier Mary Renault novels
0345389409|2.0|I have read the first 4 books of the Vampire Chronicles  and loved them all.  They are all action packed and give us an in-depth view of Lestats life and struggle.  Now  Rice goes into a 400 page long debate on Good versus bad  and God versus the Devil.  I would rather read the Bible  for that.  This isn't about Lestat or Vampires at all!  I   had several friends tell me &quot;Don't read it - it is boring   and slow&quot; But I didn't listen.  I couldn't read it past 120  pages and I couldn't even get through the cassettes.  If   you like Anne Rice you should hate this book because it  has nothing to do with her former stuff at all.
0385292244|5.0|Shogun deals with John Blackthorne,and his crew who ends up shipwrecked in Japan.  What seemed like a primitive culture, turned out to be an advanced and scheming one.<BR><BR> This book deals with corruption, love, and power to the fullest degree.  Yet educates you in Japanese history so nicely, that you will find a new respect.  Heck, you'll even learn a few Japanese words.
0684874350|2.0|Frank McCourt's relentless catalogue of the horrors of his upbringing, while accurate in his case, were not typical of the vast majority of Irish poor of that time.  His family  life was an extreme - his father was an extreme - the death  of three siblings was an extreme.  McCourt does a wonderful  job portraying his mother's courage and in showing the   psychic baggage the Irish Catholic poor are lumbered with.  But this is a mightily flawed book and the acclaim it is  receiving astounds me.  The child's point of view is finally  tedious and wears us down; the pathos is well-worn and   tired; the book lacks any lyricism.  This is a still-born  book and McCourt should try again to give us the book that  all the critics are raving about.
0312857063|4.0|I loved this boook, althouhg the story was too quickly resolved. I like this author/series for the exact reasons that the previous poster did not. Goodkind takes old cliches of the fantasy/sci-fi genre, and makes them BETTER. Somehow he improves on these authors' stories. While I did not like the way he plagiarized the Aes Sedai idea from Robert Jordan. The stories you mentioned are some of my favorite stories. I could like nothing more than I like Star Wars. (Star Trek sucks!) I have read only one of Eddings books, but I have heard he, like Jordan, gets very boring after a just a few books. I have read all of Jordan's books by the way. Goodkind's greatest asset is not his ability to create a universe in which you can completely immerse yourself (like George Lucas' Star Wars), but his ability to draw the reader into the story from page one, and keep the book moving along at an unbelievably fast pace. Jordan and Eddings can only wish they had the same talent. Goodkind is the best author for an intelligent<br />person that is looking for a good series to start his foray into the fantasy genre. Once you have read other authors, Goodkind's greatness is not quite so apparent, but nevertheless, it is still there.<br /><br /> I liked Wizard's First Rule much better,and I even liked The Blood of the Fold a little better.

0385311400|5.0|I have read the other reviews and I agree with all of them.<br />Many aspects of the series have been touched upon by all the<br />reviews. This series is the ONLY set of books that I could<br /> not put down. Like others I interested friends and<br /> co-workers to read the books, even men! through much<br /> assuring that it was NOT a trashy romance despite the<br /> location in the book stores. (Real men can buy a book from<br /> the romance section.) People I encouraged to read the books<br /> told me: they refused to answer the phone, the door,<br /> cut short evenings out (much to their spouses dismay) and<br /> generally ignored the outside world till there were no more<br /> books to read. Best books for anyone sick in bed, that<br /> can't stand convalescing. These books sparked heated debates<br /> on where the characters were going, why they did what they<br /> did, what they TRUELY felt instead of what they said. I had<br /> a friend tell me &quot;Its just a book, calm down&quot; till they read<br /> the series, now they want to know why its taking so long for<br /> the next one. It was agony having to wait for each publication and I envy those people that can go on to the next book<br /> as soon as they shut the cover of the last. Mesmerizing,<br /> enrapting, mind expanding, stimulating to want to know more;<br /> &quot;Ah, there's where Lallybrook would be&quot; while looking at a<br /> map of Scottish Clan territories. As you can tell I cannot<br /> laud these books enough, I would love to see them in movie<br /> format but only if it could be done as well as Interview<br /> with a Vampire, where the movie WAS the book with no poetic<br /> license shortcuts the movie industry loves to make (i.e. see<br /> Steven King). I do have one suggestion for casting, Tim Roth<br /> as Randall, it was deja vu when I saw Rob Roy. But finding a<br /> 6'5&quot;, charismatic, red haired, muscular, beautifully proportioned, handsome actor with enough talent to be able to play<br /> Jamie will be hard to find.
0684833395|5.0|Is it possible for a book to merit all the above adjectives above? Yes, if it is Catch-22; in the setting of World War II, Heller depicts the sheer  waste and tragedy for humans, when 'nations' are at war. Catch-22 seeks to show the waste exemplified by the War , without ever depicting a direct attack by the  enemy, the Germans. The protagonist of the book, Yossarian, sees through the sham that war is, and questions  his superiors relentlessly about their ideas of patriotism, when it is he  who is going to die 'for the country'. the novel moves back and forth in time, through  events and from the farcical to the tragic at a machine-gun pace. Yet within this seeming disarray, a  tale builds up- in the end you wonder who the real enemy is - the Germans or Yossarian's superiors

0553103547|5.0|If you liked Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, get set to enter<br />a world even more engaging! George R. R. Martin has set us upon a journey following<br />the House Stark of Winterfell and their quest of peace for their family in a land<br /> where it is denied them at every turn. I don't know when I've ever read a book as<br /> captivating as this one is. This is the first volume of four (the second, due in the<br /> summer of '97) and as much as I wish all were available right now, the time lag here<br /> will give me time to re-read A Game of Thrones another time or two before the<br /> second is released. If you like to get so wrapped up in a book that you can't wait to<br /> get back home to read some more, this is the one you need to get into. Every time<br /> you think you've figured out what the next turn of fate will bring the members of the<br /> Stark family, George Martin snatches the rug out from under you as you pour into the<br /> next chapter. This is the finest writing I've found in the last two decades!
0812550706|5.0|This was the first book I read of Orson Scott Card's. I first read it in the sixth grade(I'm 14), and I loved it. I forgot about it until last year when I saw the book again. I found all the sequels to it including the recent &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;. I even read the &quot;Earthfall&quot; Series and his &quot;Alvin Maker&quot; series. You have got to read this book. The psychology/action theme makes this a great page turner
0440211727|5.0|This book is great from beggining 'til end. It's definatly one of the greatest books I've ever read. Grisham keeps you turning pages until your done. It won't let you take your eyes off of each and every page! This book is great if I had to buy it again I would. You won't regret this. Is a book you should really spend your money on, or just rent it at your local library. It's the BomB!!

0394530411|5.0|If you could check circle 20, it would still be an underestimation of this incredible novel. Something Wicked is without question the finest piece of contemporary american literature to ever be written.  Starting as a child's tale or fable, the book expands into a mult-layered, multi-complex novel involving death, life and all parts in between. The dynamic tension of freindship, lost loves and puberty  are all dealt with in this amazing piece of work. The premise, a &quot;dark&quot; carnival ariving in a small mid-western town in October is common Bradbury territiry. And there is no doubt of the autobigraphical  nature of this work. As the story weaves itself through the town's population, the two boys at the center of the story, are the only ones that sense the approaching darkness that the carnival brings.   In classic Bradbury prose, the reader is trasported with eloquent descriptions into the story itself. One of the two climaxes of the story, a confrontation between one of the boy's fathers (an aging man  with buckets of regrets and no real hope for the future) and Mr. Dark, the owner of the Carnival is rollercoaster ride of words. In a time where action has displaced writing in novels, this scene is a   delight to anyone who enjoys good literature.     The film adaptation was atrocious, and looked (as Dinsey films do) only at a single element in a multi-faceted story. This film should not be used to judge this book. So don't be put off because of the film.  If you read ANY book this year, make it this one.

0679745203|5.0|Perhaps oe of the greatest fictional stories ever written, Ondaatje's &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a true masterpiece.  Set in the post-WWII era, in the hills above Florence, Italy, this  story captures you from the start.  The characters have a deft  and masterful power about them, particulary the Patient, whose  majesty and subtlety are brilliant.  The end leaves you awed,  its' tragedy and sacrifice fills one with a sense of true  desolation.  Sublime and intoxicating, like a draught of fine  wine, this book is a must-read.
1574530011|5.0|As adults we forget to keep asking the philosophical questions that were so stimulating in our early adulthoods.   This book reminds us of all those questions:  Is there a God?  What is the meaning of life?  What is human knowledge and where does it come from?  It is very exciting to stretch your mind again over the theoretical.   This book is the tool to help you do so.

0060920084|5.0|Bill Bryson's travelogue of the United States can be best described as a side-splitter.  Like many of the others who have reviewed this book for Amazon, I found myself reading it out loud to anyone who was close by. A great way to make friends at crowded airports.   This is the tale of Bryson's travels as a young adult with many references to his childhood experiences in Iowa doing such things as traveling on summer vacation with his parents and sister.  While the book has a definite Iowa slant, his experiences are so universal that they will be enjoyed by all. What man has not wondered why the nubile cuties of his youth look as if they had swallowed airmattresses 10 or 15 years later.  Bryson is cynical, jaded, snide and sentimental all at the same time.  A good book for anyone who has traveled to Boston, Washington DC  and particularly good for anyone with Iowa roots.  And, by the way, his mother seems to be still alive and well - I saw an article in the Des Moines Register recently with her byline
0679731725|3.0|After reading the reviews here and seeing the movie, I bought the book with a great sense of anticipation. The plot: a review of the life of a perfect English butler who has the twilight  of his years to look forward to. Perhaps the movie gave too  much away, but I did not find the book amongst the more engrossing  that I have read. The last five pages are the only ones  where I got a sense of the pathos of the character. Read &quot;The  Postman&quot; instead and see what I mean.
0385311400|5.0|Drums of Autumn carries the story of Jamie and Claire Fraser beyond happily ever after to the reality of the rest of their lives.  In doing so, Gabaldon creates a believable and poignant portrait of a marriage that works. Their relationship continues to involve the reader because both Jamie and Claire grow individually within it. This is marriage at its best; offering love, security, and the freedom to be and become.  These books are not romances, nor histories, nor adventure stories.  They are, instead, accounts of one couple's struggle to find themselves through each other in their struggle to establish &quot;a marriage of true minds&quot; under the most unlikely of circumstances.  Never maudlin, the series celebrates the best of love, marriage, committment, and mutuality. I am only sorry I have finished Drums of Autumn and will probably have a long wait until the final(?) book in the series is available

I  anxiously await the arrival of Diana Gabaldon's newest   edition to the saga of Jamie and Clair.  Just over a year ago I   purchased the original three of the series, having great   difficulty due to the fact I'm stationed overseas with the   military.  Upon completing the books my husband unwittingly  sold them in a yard sale and I was so upset I could barely   speak!  My biggest wish was to get the serious again for my  birthday or Christmas.  My Mom sent them to me and I have   not been able to put them down, again.  I have reread these   terrific books.  They are my means of escape.  I love   learning about the Scottish history, and can put myself out   of my bed and into the pages of Mrs. Gabaldon's books.  It   is with exceeding joy I find her fourth book is out and as  I complete the final pages of &quot;Voyager&quot; I await the arrival  of &quot;Drums of Autumn.&quot;  I've never read a book more than once,  and I know I will be reading these over and over in the  year's to come.  I congratulate Mrs. Gabaldon on her zeal  and ability to write.  I only wish I could finish the many  paragraphs and stories I've written.  Her ability to include  so much research is commendable.  It's given me renewed  passion to find out more about my ancestors.  If what other's  have written is true, I expect &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; to not be the  last, and wait on pins and needles to find out how Jamie and  Clair get back to Scotland ... afterall ... that is where she saw  their grave markers, isn't it?  Thank you, Mrs. Gabaldon, for  new views on how to live our lives, with trust, honor, and   courage!

Everybody loves Ender, the boy genius, plucked from his home, his family, and his planet and shuttled off to Battle School to fight the Buggers; an alien species, intent on colonizing Earth and destroying the human race.  A non-stop action adventure and perfect for everyone young and old.  The best science-fiction book for anyone who claims not to like the genre. The first time I read this book I did so on a 45 hour road-trip from my home in New Jersey to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Myself and three buddies from college all read it during our two-week adventure.  It was recommended by the brother of one of the guys who was a West Point cadet.  It turns out Ender's Game was on the Required Reading List for his freshman class.  While in Jackson, I bought book 2, Speaker for the Dead, and read it on the trip home (naturally putting it down when it was my turn to drive). Since then, I have given this book to my mother, two of my sisters and their two sons.  All loved it.

0312853238|5.0|Card's insight into human nature is remarkable. Ender, to me, represented all humanity. We have the power to make things happen, but we are pushed and pulled by the very things that make us human... Our beliefs. Card, i think had this in mind when he sat down to this book. Ender's belief that it was &quot;just a game&quot; is the reason he was so good at winning. It was only when he was mounted against &quot;unbeatable&quot; odds that he lashed out. If he had known the truth, he would have reacted diffrently in each simulation. knowing that his actions, would have reprocussions on his fellow humans. Overall, it was a wonderful book, nicely told but &quot;deep&quot; in its own nature

While reading &quot;The Five Love Languages&quot;, I thought of five couples that could benefit from this knowledge, and several marriages that might have been saved.  Though the author points out that, ultimately, the key to a successful relationship is choosing to love, this book puts it within anyone's power.  I would recommend it to everyone--especially those who are engaged to be married.  Had I known these principles earlier, I could have saved myself and my spouse a lot of heartache.  I feel hopeful about the future and look forward to the rest of my life with my husband

0312954468|1.0|Ancient Egypt is one of my hobbies.  I collect books, non-fiction and fiction, that have anything to do with it.  I picked up Smith's River God and gave it a try.  I was horribly disappointed.  The storytelling is decent, although there are not enough characters to sustain believability (a pharaoh's entourage was never *that* small!) and the main character, Taita, is just unsufferably smart --he invents everything short of the microwave oven.    The history is atrocious, and that is where the book condemns itself.  Not only are there numerous anachronisms (glass-blowing, shadoufs, etc), but this is the first time I've seen an author not use the rich tapestry of Ancient Egyptian history: this book is about a dynasty that never existed.  Not only are the Hyksos represented as a tidal wave (borne on the innovation of the war chariot), which is nothing like what actually happened, but we see, in the course of the story, an entire city's worth of Egyptians uproot themselves and travel upstream along the Nile to somewhere in Ethiopia and back.  What is unforgivable is that Nubia is shown as uninhabited, a wilderness, whereas in reality it was a vice-royalty of Egypt, nearly as heavily settled (in the Late Period, there even was a Nubian dynasty), that would later give rise to the great civilizations of Meroe and Axum.    When compared to the books by Silverberg (Thebes of the Hundred Gates), Jacq (The Judge of Egypt), Montlaur (Nitocris, Imhotep), Pratchett (Pyramids), Prus (The Pharaoh), Norton (Shadow Hawk), Morris (I, the Sun), Tarr (Lord of the Two Lands), Powers (The Anubis Gates), Saberhagen (Pyramids) and, above all, Gedge (her Scroll of Saqarra is a masterpiece!), this book deserves to be relegated to oblivion.

0812548094|5.0|It could be argued that deep, involved plots are the surest way to lose your audience.  Certainly, this was what happened whenever I picked up the newest Tolkien release.  Whew, talk about complex!!  But Terry Goodkind changed all that for me.  His subtle intermixing of intense character development, deep emotional suffering, and occasional comic surprises hooked me like no fantasy novel has ever done before.  The main character's persona seems to leap from the page and project itself directly to the &quot;adventure center&quot; of the mind, where it springs to life in a blaze of light and glory.  The relationships in the book were well developed and realistic in a way that I've never seen before.  I found them, and the book, to be a refreshing change from the humdrum worlds wrought by everyday fantasy artists.  Indeed, this latest book in Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series brings me to a point far from the tears espoused by the title, unless you can count tears of joy
0451452739|5.0|2001 is about the creation of the universe, the position of the man in that Universe, that fantastic universe and that book/novel gives the right feelings, the true feelings about it.  2001 is imaginative and gives the possibility to the reader to dream, to hope of a better universe, a better world.   2001 is for now and for the years to come, one of the greatest adventure of all time and I hope that, as long as Humans will exist, they will remember 2001 because it's a masterpiece, an immortal masterpiece
0451523652|5.0|This enchanting novel tells the story of Elizabeth Bennett, a young English woman with one elder and three younger sisters.  Elizabeth's younger sisters are silly young girls who favor their senseless mother.  Her father loves her dearly.  He adds humor to the novel with his near-sarcastic views of his family.  The other characters in the novel range from her completely silly and senseless cousin Collins, to the conniving Miss Bingley, to the indescribable Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth's beau.  Austen uses the perfect combination of humor, romance, and suspense in this unforgettable story.  I was unable to put this book down, but I regretted it not being any longer
0812550706|2.0|This was the first science fiction book I have read in a long time.  And after reading &quot;Ender's Lame&quot; I am ready to go back to reading anything else BUT science fiction!  I have never before read a more pretentious and shallow, not to mention silly story than this one about space boy meeting the bee people.  That t.v. show, &quot;Santa Claus Versus the Martians&quot; had more depth than this trash.  The thing that irks me the most about the story is the lack of believability.  OK, I can deal with aliens attacking Earth, the military breeding kiddie war-geniuses, and war games in space.  BUT THE DAMN SIX-YEAR-OLD, ENDER, ACTS LIKE AN ADULT!  Future kid or not, he is nothing like a child, except in size.  He thinks, acts, and talks like an adult.  Card never offers any explanation as to why Ender is like this.  The reader just has to accept it.  Why couldn't Card give some explanation for the way space-boy is, or at least use an adult for the protagonist instead?  The most unbelievable aspect of Ender was his advanced adult social skills.  He knew things NO six-year-old could possibly know, such as one time when he offered his commander a chance to &quot;save face.&quot;  You learn these kinds of skills through experience, and usually far into adulthood.  Question everything you read, readers.  Just because it is science-fiction does not mean it has to be shallow and insulting to your intelligence

0553268120|5.0|Speaking from my own viewpoint, that of a small horse farm owner and generally soft-hearted animal admirer, I would like to recommend this book to others who feel that &quot;something special&quot; for the four-footed kind.  The humor in this book also offers warm chuckles on cold foal-watch nights.  Anyone with a sense of humor, even should they hate fur or feathers, would truly enjoy this one.  Mr. Herriot's portrayal of his fellow man is not only insightful, it's downright uplifting!  (It lifted me up out of my chair and onto the floor a few times.  Laughing.
0553260111|5.0|I've already read this book three times in the last few years and I'm still not bored with it! This book is sure to go down in the anals of thrillers as one of the greatest books ever written.I could hardly belive I was transported into the fascinationg world of espionage, blackmail and suchlike by the vivid style of Ludlum. This is a book that is a must for all thrill seeker
1881273156|5.0|If you are not a recluse, you need to read this book.  This book has enhanced (if not saved) my sister's marriage.  I recommend it to every couple that I come in contact with.  As a reader you will gain so much insight into your relationships with your friends, neighbors, spouses, children, co-workers --- EVERYONE. If you 'lend' this book to others, be prepared to buy another, because once they read it they will want to 'lend' it to their friends and so on....
0440131480|5.0|Breakfast of Champions is a great read.  It addresses you as a three-year old and explains even the simplest concepts in new and hilarious ways.  It is vulgar and attention-grabbing.  His simple drawings can draw a hearty laugh, even from the dullest of people.  Well, maybe I shouldn't go that far, but they are quite entertaining. This book is good for when your mind has an overload on intelligent thought.
0802130208|5.0|Bought this book sight unseen from QPB a few years ago and was absolutely amazed, as was the professor quoted in the foreword, at its high quality. As the first person to publish Emily Dickinson's poems must have felt, surely no writer this good could possibly have gone unpublished!  I have read thousands of novels over the years and maintained my own personal reviews and ratings. My highest rating, five stars, is reserved for true classics that reward unlimited re-readings. Very few books receive that accolade. This is one. &quot;Dunces&quot; is one of the funniest books ever published in the English language, tragicomic in the Rabelaisan, Cervantes sense of the word, but also falling-down-on-the-floor hilarious. Laughed 'til the tears came, and then I couldn't stop weeping. Couldn't stop turning pages, just to see what could possibly happen next.    It is tempting to regret Toole's death, and to wonder if perhaps he would have produced more works of this caliber. In great art, though, quantity seldom equals quality. Toole was a shooting star who captured in &quot;Dunces&quot; his bittersweet understanding of the human condition for the edification of all future generations.
0679745203|5.0|THE ENGLISH PATIENT IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BOOKS I'VE READ IN A LONG TIME.  THE TALE IS GRIPPING AND IS ABLE TO TRANSPORT THE READER FROM HER LIVINGROOM COUCH TO THE SAHARA AND THE RUINED ITALIAN MONASTARY.  THE LANGUAGE IS SMOOTH AND POETIC.  IF YOU WANT TO ESCAPE FOR THE DAY FROM THE MUNDANE THAT IS YOUR LIFE, THIS IS THE BOOK THAT WILL DO IT FOR YOU
0385311400|5.0|It was a great feeling of familiarity to open Drums Of Autumn and step once again into the lives of Claire and Jamie.  That they have grown older and matured is quite evident (don't we all though!), but it is nice to see that their love and commitment to each other continues to grow.  The historical aspects of the book were (once again) remarkable and make more of an impression in my mind than any history class ever did. There were parts in the book I had to re-read a few times to actually &quot;get&quot; what had happened - like the people with smallpox being thrown overboard.  And like someone else who reviews the book further down, I wasn't sure what the tomb stone reference was implying.  I am assuming that Frank had the stone placed there, so Jamie does not die in Scotland - as we all thought he must from the previous novels.  But that just makes my anticipation for the next book that much stronger.  Great work, Diana.
0553280325|5.0|A true literary gem. The images from this book will haunt you for the rest of your life.  Forget the movie. This book plays with the mythic elements of your soul. Immortality? You can have it. Old Age? Gone. Youth? It's yours. What is it you want? You can get it.  Perhaps Bradbury's best, it is truly a must-read.  Read it. Because, next time, the circus might visit your town...
0425132153|5.0|Do not read this book in public ! Even for the 5th or 6th time around. It should still bring you out in hysterics (unless there is something drastically wrong with you) and you might end up tucked away in an asylum. Terry Pratchett claims that the devil made them do it. Still, this book ought to be reimbursed by social security.
0451169514|5.0|King truly outdoes himself with this story spanning 30 years.  An ancient terror haunts the town of derry maine, and 7 youths team up to fight it.  Kings best book!!!!
0451169514|2.0|That is the sound that a Stephen King novel makes as it enters its final forty pages.  King is almost unmatched in his ability to entice a reader into his stories, much like Pennywise the clown entices children to their death in &quot;IT.&quot;  Stephen King so often promises great rewards and leads the reader to believe that the end will be worth being engrossed in 400-plus pages of prose, but with the exception of &quot;The Stand,&quot; he lures the reader into his web and then rewards the reader with a fate worse than death by Pennywise, a wasted read.  Could it be that Stephen King himself is the ultimate embodiment of evil to the reading world
0553473328|5.0|I think that this is the best of the Claire/Jamie series since the first book, Outlander! Plot is tighter, the story doesn't drag anywhere, and great character development. It's nice to see that Jamie is multifaceted enough to make some mistakes, and Roger has become MUCH more interesting! I'm not sure how Brianna is going to develop as she matures, should be interesting. Definitely worth the wait. A map would have been useful. I get &quot;lost&quot; sometimes; but this is a minor criticism
0380002930|5.0|I first read this book in high school and read it again about ten years later to my niece when she was eight years old.  She also loved it.  It has everything - adventure, heroes, narrow escapes, a worthy villain in General Woundwort, along with two of my favorite characters in literature - Hazel, the quietest of heroes, and Bigwig, brave to a fault and anything but quiet!  I don't think Watership Down will ever be replaced as my favorite book.  (A side note:  I did not enjoy the animated movie version)
0140049975|5.0|I started this book at least five times, and gave up in the first chapter each one of them.  The first chapter is  boreing and drawn out. BUT, after that first chapter the story grabs on, and never lets go.  I LOVED it, and every time I reread it, I love it more. If you can't get through the first chapter, skip it. When you reach the end you'll be so hungry for more that you'll go back and read it
0385486804|5.0|If you remeber Chris McCandless, it is probably from the news stories or the widely read Outside magazine piece by this author.  McCandless, if you remeber, was found by moose hunters in an abandoned bus near Mount McKinley in Alaska where had starved to death.  His parents had not heard of him or from him for two years.      At the outset,the author begins a search for explainations of Chirs Mc Candless, his estrangement from family and Society, and his lonely death.  But as he goes on, Krankauer extends his efforts to a type of which McCandless is but a recent represnetative.  As revealed by Krakauer, McCandless is but one a quietly desparate class of wanders, vagabonds and near mystics that inhabit the roads and backwaters of American, a class which he Krakauer also joined early in his life.  Like many a mystic vagabond, Chris was startllingly brilliant and talented.  But he was a young man incapable of accepting the world for the the rather unethical, sub-moral place it is.  But, rather than rush off on a crusade against injustice he precieved, McCandless truned his sights inward.  It is choice of viewpoint that lead to his death.     A subtile mix of visionary, genius and wounded son, Chris is not all that differrent from the people we all meet.  Half way through the book his image began to blur with memories of a highly talented friend who dropped out of Stanford Grad school for a life as a full time &quot;valley climber&quot; in Yosemite.  But what makes the book so chilling is that we never get a definitive answer as to why Chris followed his ultimately fatal route through life.   McCandless' background is not all that horrible, although it is not strewn with roses, either. Yet many others, with far more reason to follow in his footsteps, avoid the downward slope Chris choose and become happy and productive people.       The disturbing, and unanswered question of this book reamins.  Who are the McCandlesses of the future, where are they now and, for we parents, do we have a Chris McCandless under our own roof?
0446520950|5.0|Absolute Power was an extremely hard act for Baldacci to follow, but he totally succeeded in creating another page-turner with surprise plot twists and great characterizations.Can't wait for his next novel - my guess is the title will be &quot;Complete&quot; something
0451175123|5.0|This book is wonderful.  It reads like a story, yet has the depth of an outstanding philosophical work... very easy  to comprehend.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with   a high school reading level or above.    If you admire egotists or are one yourself, you'll LOVE this book!!!
0385121679|5.0|Stephen King has created a twisted tale of supernatural that will leave you spellbound. A frightning tale of a family trapped in a hotel resort, where evil lurks around every corner. A wonderful feel for the characters and a too real setting, proves why King is the master of storytelling. If a horror fan, your a fool to pass this one up
0440111498|5.0|<br />At the tender age of 19, thanks to Kurt Vonnegut and Cat's Cradle, I learned that a book did not have to be 800 pages  long and have a happy ending to be a great book.  More importantly, I realized that I didn't have to understand a book to enjoy it.  <br />I recently reread Cat's Cradle for the fourth time, and 20 years later, I'm no closer to understanding it.  Yet, I still caught myself laughing out loud and profoundly sad upon reading the final paragraph.    <br />Cat's Cradle is not the best book I've ever read, but reading it opened my mind and allowed me to pick up and read some of the best books I've ever read
078710017X|5.0|This is a superbly written novel. It educated me in the Chinese customs, and made me form an opinion of Asian American Stereotypes in America. Evryone's heritage is special, and is to be learned, accepted and respected as contributing to what each of us is today. Tan has spun a wonderful tale of soldarity of dissimilar women whose only commonality is their Asian heritage. Excellent novela must for women, however, most men will not find it very interesting, as the male characters are subplots
0312954468|5.0|I bought this book recently just because I got a bargain price.  It turned out that it is a wonderful, fascinating story of ancient egypt which is based more on fact that fiction.  The original writer of this story actually existed in ancient egypt!  His name was Taita and he was a slave for the Queen Lostris.  He wrote her life story on ten scrolls and placed it in her ancient tomb as a tribute to her.  In 1988 it was found and translated so that we can appreciate and learn from these words still today.  I simply can't recommend this book enough.  Amazon sells it at a great price and it is definitely a must read!  You WILL love it
0679731725|5.0|Most writers are taught to tell stories about characters who change.  This book is the most beautiful and heartbreaking story of a character who cannot change.  Ishigura brings us deep into the heart of a man, a butler, who is tragically set in his ways to the point that he forsakes both family and true love.  It leaves us begging the question about ourselves:  What faults in our characters cause us to overlook happiness and responsibility in our lives

0553277472|5.0|This book has the power to change lives...whether you believe Pirsig's philsophy or not.  'Zen &amp; the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance' is one of the most true books ever written.  It is slopping over with brutally honest insight into the human frailties of mind and spirit.  By the time you close the cover, you will have learned a little about Western philosophy, Eastern mysticism and yourself.  An extraordinary effort
0804102988|3.0|I bought this book as a souvenir of Stonehenge to breathe life into the story of the stones.  That much it did.  Then it got bogged down half way through the book in the 1100s.  Now I'm having trouble picking it back up.  I wish James A. Michner had written it! J. Phelan
0486211045|5.0|This book has been very useful as a reference for me personally and for the students that I teach. The subject matter is illustrated in a way that makes it possible to use for all levels without offending anyone
044651652X|1.0|Why did my best friend insist I read this? Why did so many people revere this ridiculous rabble? Why didn't I Just Say No? And to think they made a two hour movie out of a book that takes 30 minutes to read.<br /><br />I wish the rating system here offered the chance to assign negative numbers. This treacly excuse for literature (O, and I am loath to even use that word in this review) cries out for  a -googolplex. Run, run for your lives.
0679720200|4.0|Camus has written a story in the simplest form to investigate an extremely complicated side of human nature.  Every word uttered by the narrator causes even the most apathetic human to read it twice, constantly asking how he could so callously brush off every event in his life.  This is a book that not only asks, but demands to be read several times
0783811950|5.0|The Alchemist is one of my favorite books, one that I can re-read again and again and never fail to learn from.  The fable of a boy who is not afraid to follow his dream, it inspires us to pay more attention to the world around us, and learn to see and hear in a more open way.  I have started to incorporate some of the lessons of this book into my life, and the positive momentum that has come as a result is unbelievable.  I would recommend this book to anyone, and especially to those at any sort of transition point in their lives
0060975768|5.0|Moore and Galloway's book is one of the most powerful non-fiction  books I have ever read.  Reading &quot;We Were Soldiers Once . . .  and Young&quot; brought two contradictory feelings forth within myself.    On one hand, I could not imagine the horror of being in this place   of death and destruction of the most brutal kind.  At the same time,   I was almost envious of the bond of comradeship and sacrifice that   bound these soldiers together under the threat of danger.  As a   current military officer who will probably never see combat, this   book illustrated to me how combat can bring about the most   brutal and the most compassionate of human behaviors.
0553565915|5.0|Facing a terminal illness myself, I turned to this book as a solace in the hopes it would help me to deal with my own mortality.  What I found instead was a vivid and inspirational account showing me how to live out my life in a more positive and meaningful way.  There is more positive energy in this book than any other book I have read on the subject. Death is inevitable and we all must come to terms with this reality in our own way; life is what you make of it each day and this books turns living into a quest for growth and outreach that makes me look forward to each and every day
0312932081|5.0|If one only reads the words on the pages, Ender's Game will seem like a juvenile book written about a juvenile boy for juvenile audiences.  It's full of action, humor and all of your typical sci-fi techniques.  But this book is also political, emotional, and very powerful.  It's about the struggle Andrew Wiggin faces with his childhood in the future, his talent and how society inevitably tricks him into doing something that will haunt him the rest of his life.  It's a powerful statement about war and society's prejudices.  This is why Ender's Game is one of my favorite novels.  It takes action and humor and manages to get across to the reader the horrors of war and prejudice
006017322X|5.0|It takes me back to that age when i first read that book, when i was young and dreamy, and longed for a father like Atticus and a brother like Jem. I could identify so much with Scout, inspite of coming from a different culture and background. It speaks a lot for the book - for the universal concepts of justice and fairness that it brought out unconciously. And of hope, and confusion and joy and simple pleasures, and introduction and comprehension of the world of adults
0553278355|5.0|It is interesting in that it shows that &quot;teenage angst&quot;, a term that we often apply to the Generation X-ers of today, has always been prevalent in society. It treats depression and feelings of self-worthlessness as real and tangiable things. Someone who had not experienced these feelings herself would not have been able to write such a believable novel.  Kristy Wandl
0887306713|5.0|Before being promoted to direct any influential company, people should be required to answer a mastermind quiz on the learning organisation realities discovered in this book. The authors have combed through decades of corporate information to reveal that internal marketing culture and  aligned vision are the fundamental drivers of sustainable corporate growth. If you can convince  directors to take at least a three year perspective - instead of accounting's quarterly ones - in  everything they measure and opinion lead, then their companies are candidates for real wealth  creation. This book's living testimony to the true spirit of marketing leadership is that &quot;visionary&quot;  companies grow eight times more wealth in a generation than average companies. Think of the  difference in future prospects of a nation (Japan?) which invests mainly in visionary  (knowledge-creating) companies and one (UK?) which invests mainly in average (short-termist or  poor learning) companies. And you start to see why every leader - from CEO to national politician  - should be screened for marketing and cultural competence.

0553260111|2.0|The concept was great--a man with no identity but with tantalizing clues to a dangerous past.  I loved the story line but felt that the book should have been condensed.  The main character was too introspective and whining.  It seemed out of character with his supposedly &quot;tough-guy&quot; past and experiences.  I skipped paragraph after paragraph of his monotonous reflecting and self-berating.  I do not recommend recommend this book
0671688782|5.0|Have you ever been hurt by someone you love?  Have you ever turned your back and walked out, slamming the door and shouting &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; while secretly hoping your loved one would come after you to reassure you that you're loved, that you're not alone?  Do you remember what it felt like when they never came?  Do you remember the loneliness, the disappointment, the humiliation you felt?  Such experiences are toxic and the more so the earlier in life we have them.  What are we doing to our children by sending them away when we can't handle their feelings?  &quot;Go to your room and don't come out `til you're willing to behave yourself!&quot;  We punish by withholding our love, and the children we raise become fearful, insecure, and clinging, prone to drug addiction and vulnerable to peer pressure.          In order for the child to overcome these fears, he will usually have to be held against some initial resistance.  He may react with anger to the fear of helplessness which the holding will bring up.  Expressing such feelings while being held in a close and loving embrace allows the child to integrate them.  Allowing himself to feel helpless and to accept the safety and protection of his mother's embrace fosters a sense of basic trust.  A person who has had the childhood experience of secure attachment to his mother will not feel that fundamental emptiness and fearfulness inside that drive others into addictions and codependency.    Dr. Welch's book runs counter to society's prevailing attitude that stresses our separateness from each other and welcomes a child's precocity and early independence.  We are so obsessed with the freedom of the individual that we give up on those who isolate themselves out of fear.  There are those who crave the natural high that comes from deep attachments but are so afraid of people that they turn to drugs instead, and all we have for them are shrugs and prisons.    For the sake of our children, I wish Dr. Welch thewidest possible readership
0679745203|5.0|I had just finished reading Bukowski's _Ham_on_Rye_ when I picked up this reading... the Bukowski was abrasive, blunt; the content was wholesome and rich, yet the style of reading was quite rudimentary, real 4th grading reading material...  Bukowski and Ondaatje are two authors who reside on different ends of the spectrum as _English_Patient_ is anything but abrasive and blunt: Ondaatje imbued this book with a bunch of subtleties, well worth a second, third reading to capture the emotion just like Copland's &quot;Appalachian Spring&quot; required a second listening in order to catch the the essence of the mountain range described by the musical piece.  As multitextured as music, _The_English_Patient_ also is deep in individual character development... a facet of each individual doesn't seem to be missing and each event doubles as a cultural eye-opener and a thought provoker.

0425132153|5.0|Gaiman and Pratchett have outdone themselves with their slant of the Apocalypse in &quot;Good Omens&quot;.  They find every nuance in in Bible and play it up with their styles.  Speaking of their styles, I have not seen a collaboration run so smoothly as this, and I hope to see much more come from these two!  This is a must-read for everyone who has ever wondered about what exactly Angels and Devils think of all of us &quot;hairless monkeys&quot;.  Just the Prologue on their view of Genesis will keep you rolling on the floor for hours!  It seems that both authors have outdone themselves in this book

0060920386|5.0|Why read fiction when all that you have to do is open the Wall St. Journal?  Barbarians at the Gate gives the reader insight into the behind the scenes details that go into a major corporate transaction.  Laymen, don't be swayed!!!  This work of non-fiction reads like a Grisham or Turow novel.  Deals are cut, backs are stabbed, and a lot a money changes hands.  Just another day at the office for players in this arena.   Having become a mergers &amp; acquisitions advisor subsequent to reading this book, I have come to realize how true to life it actually is.  Heylar and Burroughs do an excellent job of explaining the complexities of a buyout without inundating the reader with boring (trust me...boring) details.  This book is a must read for people interested in a good story, as well as people interested in life on the Street.
0385311400|5.0|I've waited a long time for this book, after reading the previous three a few years ago.  Once again, this book was delightful, as were the others.  The book seems to be historically accurate (for a non-historian like me) and the details with regard to what a 20th century physician would know and be able to apply in the 18th century are very realistic.  It took too long to find out about Roger (I peeked ahead), but all in all, a very satisfying read.  It has room for another sequel, so I hope Diana Gabaldon is working on one, and I hope it won't take as long as this one did
0451525884|5.0|This book is a fabulous read for anyone interested in almost in aspect of nineteenth century literature.  It encompasses Austen's fabulous use of irony, wonderful examples of females subverting the economic conditions that control them through their wit, and a wonderful contrast in descripitions of landscapes that are prevelent in all of Austen's books.  However, this book stands out as one of the best of the nineteenth century for many reasons.  The first is that Austen's use of irony in this book is readily apparent, especially in the dialogue and actions of the characters.  The wit that Lizzie exudes, especially in her conversations between Mr. Darcy, her unexpected love interest, and the Lady Catherine de Burgh provide endless entertainment for the reader.  The reader develops a line of sympathy for Lizzie as she struggles to make the best of her unfortunate financial situation.  Another reason to love the book not only includes the wit of Lizzie Bennet, but of her father and Mr. Darcy, which provide wonderful view into the superior workings of Austen's mind in terms of her characters' personalities.  The landscapes would provide a wonderful escape for someone stranded on a deserted island because they provide many Romantic countrysides with transcendental descriptions along with wonderful descriptions of London that make the reader feel as if they really are staying with Mrs. Gardner with Jane.  The description of Pemberley alone provides a wonderful example of the grandeur of nineteenth-century estates in England. Since I am supposedly stranded on this island on Valentine's Day, the love story contained within Austen's indirect ocmmentary on the hardships of economics on women in the nineteenth century, provides a hope that each person will meet not only the perfect person, but that person will also recognize them as their destined mate.  This book incorporates the Romantic notions of Byron and Wordsworth into Lizzie, while allowing her to retain pieces of realism that makes her supreme to all of the other female characters.  Austen also provides a wonderful sexual tension between Mr. Darcy and Lizzie that has never been equalled in any book that I have ever read, and being an English major, there have been many.  I have read this book many times and still find motifs, themes, images and nuances in the plot that provide me continually with enjoyment.  For this reason alone would I be content with having this book as my sole company on a deserted island.  The villains in this novel are also so much fun to hate because they prove to be the very foces that try to keep Lizzie and Darcy apart.  The two characters, however, persevere, which would be a very important theme for a person stranded on a desert island.  Perseverence would be the only way  one would survive the lonliness, aside from an excellent book, of course.  Austen was truly ahead of her time as critic after critic will tell you, but only after you have read one of her greatest works will you understand why it has crossed the time and custom boundries and to this day remains a wonderful piece of literature that will continue to provide enjoyment to each new reader that endeavors to read it.  Enjoy! By the way, I only noticed your sample e-mail address after I finished this review
0440539811|5.0|The Illuminatus Trilogy bombards your conscious mind with conspiritorial, illuminating, and downright perplexing theories of the Universe in order to break on through to the sub-conscious.  Every page causes you to question everything, including what you have just read.  If you don't look at Reality in a new light after reading this book, then your just not trying hard enough
0812548094|4.0|Goodkind could have easily written a book twice as long without losing the pace (and I would have happily read it).  At first, I thought (as many do) that he rushed things at the end to wrap up the story before the page count got too large.  However, after thinking about again I'm no longer so sure about that.  Goodkind makes several references to avalanches - things build and build until finally one small flake is enough to trigger an event all out of proportion to the flake itself.  If one views Stone of Tears in that light, then one might say that the story follows his avalanche model pretty well.  And, like the avalanche, there is always unintended fallout (which makes the next book all the more anticipated).  This is not unlike many crucial points in history.  Overall - good stuff
1573225517|5.0|Contrary to what many of your previous reviewers have stated, all women will not hate this book. In fact, all of my female friends have loved it. While talking to a friend about my complete and utter confusion about the Brit I was dating at the time, she pulled this book out  of her bag and said he sounds exactly like the hero in this book I'm reading, maybe this will help clarify things. She was right. I loved every word of this book and believe it does a wonderful job of conveying the confusion and inconsistencies we all face in our everyday lives, and especially in our relationships. I too grew up with Nick Hornby, albeit here in America, and in addition to the light he shed on the workings of the (English) male mind, I appreciated every song, artist and cultural reference he included. I was sorry to finish reading this book and look forward to Mr. Hornby's next work of fiction
0812550706|5.0|I cannot believe anyone gave this book less than a 10. It is superb, not only because the story is fast paced and interesting, but because when you read ender's game, you don't just read a story, you experience Ender's life as if it were your own. That's why so many people gave this book a 10 - not because they felt for Ender - but because they felt with Ender. After reading the book you'll understand what I mean.  All children should read this book simply to learn and how to think. Most adults don't like it because it just challenges their worldview, but if you are generally a positive person who is willing to learn something new, you'll love this book.
0385311400|4.0|With her latest book, Drums of Autumn, Diana Gabaldon continues to enchant us enough to look forward to more in the series which began with Outlander. The story of Claire and Jamie is compelling, but to be truthful, not as compelling as her first three installments. Something is lacking, and I believe it to be the fact that there is no truly dastardly villain such as Black Jack Randall. Also, one can only suspend belief so far when it comes to imagining life in the North Carolina wilderness in the late eighteenth century. Can we accept that Claire, even for the love of this man who is larger than life, can undertake all the chores, e.g. planting, harvesting, cooking, preserving, doctoring the neighborhood, etc., etc., and still have time and energy for a late night romp under the bushes? Besides, when did she learn to do all this? Her daughter Brianna's tragedy is almost glossed over, unlike the rape of Jamie, which was dwelled on with loving detail in previous books. The trials and tribulations of Roger MacKenzie are almost by the way. My favorite, most fully drawn character in this book is John Grey. He is charming, sympathetic and tragic. I keep seeing David Hyde Pierce of Frasier in the role. While I loved Diana Gabaldon's first three novels, I merely liked this one. Enough to read more, but also hoping for more.
0070016798|5.0|It is the best book for aerodynamics in the world. and if you major in aerospace engineering, i strongly recommend this book.
0060174900|5.0|This was simply too powerful a book to describe.  I would reccommend anyone who has ever felt themselves overwhelmed, to take this eerie journey with a woman who could not take the pressures life has to offer.  But beware, the strength of her prose offers a view, sometimes too close for comfort, of a mind in the ravages of a breakdown.  Rebecca Silverstein
0802130208|5.0|A more whimical look at New Orleans and its mix of people has never been written.  The early passing of John Kennedy Toole [age 23] is all the more heart wrenching when you read this beatifully crafted work
0880381736|5.0|In a time when adventure is found, and magic is seen often, comes a tale of a group of friends joined together in a time of need.          After five long years, A group of friends meet, only to be sent on a quest to find the greatest gift of all.  After they find the healing powers of a goddess, they return to Solace to find that childhood tales have come to haunt them in the form of dragons.  But before the group can save the world from these things of evil, they must learn to understand each other, and themselves.
0345403959|5.0|I enjoyed reading Belgarath the Sorcerer very much.  It was fun to discover the background on the mysterious sorcerer.  When I finished reading the Mallorean I was sad because there wasn't any more to read about the characters I loved so much, but then I found Belgarath the Sorcerer and was happy to read it.  I laughed and cried, which happens when I read my favorite books.  Now I'm just waiting for David and Leigh to write another one
0312084986|5.0|This has to be the best book I  have ever read,even better than &quot;Horse Whisperer.&quot; Jim tells of his experiences about being a country veterinarian in Yorkshire,Darrowby,and other neighboring cities. He tells of different adventures he has at the Skeldale House,where he and his colleuge, Seigfried, work. Herriot tells of good times and bad,and of his encounters with people and animals alike.This book really increased my vocabulary, it helped me to become more literate about animals and diseases. Everyone will love this book. Five Stars *****
0517702967|4.0|In &quot;The Third Twin&quot; Ken Follett makes you wonder, and worry, at the abilities of modern science.  The book leads you into the hallowed halls of research academia and the deceptions that go on within, as well as the scarey potential of modern genetics.  Not only will it keep you turning the pages wanting more, but it asks the questions of how far can we trust scientists and the corporations that fund research
0440213525|2.0|THE WEAKEST OF ALL GRISHAM'S BOOKS.  I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY, IF THE BOY WANTS TO TELL THE TRUTH AND DOESN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT, HE JUST DOESN'T PLACE AN ANONYMOUS CALL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK.  WITH ALL THAT ASIDE, GRISHAM'S STYLE IS EXCELLENT, VERY READABLE AND FAST PACED
1563523302|5.0|This is a practical approach to accumulate wealth as well as making many excellent suggestions in regards to raising children as it relates to finances and responsibility. Self control is emphasized
0552124753|5.0|Terry Pratchett is a well respected author, and to date has released over 15 books in the Discworld range.  The book gets off to a fast-paced start, and continues this  way until the inevitable, but hilarious end.  The   characters are well written and the plot is good.  If you  have read other Pratchett books, be prepareed to hear the  same old jokes again.  In the first ten books Terry seems  to feel the need to tell everyone the overall plot many   times.  Later on, he assumes that you have read previous  books.  This book, like others of Terry's are difficult  for Dyslexics to read as most of the jokes are puns and  require a competent reader.  On the whole, a brilliant   book to start the Discworld series on.
0553277472|5.0|This a favourite book of mine, and I want to say that it is not a novel, but a very straightforward and honest account of Pirsig's life, a new philosophical  system he had created, and a journey he made with his son and friends.
0553260111|4.0|Jason Bourne may be an agent with extra ordinary skills that normally only a robot can have. But you can't tell it simply to your friends. You are really stunned by the style of writing and the convincing flow of events. And you'll find a position in your heart for our hero. This is Jason Bourne. The bold and the beautiful. Because when you are reading this book, you won't get time to mind the time. It simply passes. If you want to fast for some hours, may be day, and you don't want to feel it, I'll recommend this thriller. Don't worry if you finish this book. Bourne is waiting
0887306101|5.0|this is one of the books on my must have list for anyone even thinking about investing.  although these are interviews with top traders, don't be fooled.  many of the philosophies that become readily apparent as being shared amongst all interviewed in this title are just as valuable to medium and long term investors as well
068483605X|5.0|This is the only book I read for three years.  I enjoyed it so much, I had to read it over and over again.  I was only 13 then and have since lost my copy.  But, now at age 27, I will buy another copy, and read it once more.  Yes, I have PLENTY of other books on my bookshelves, and I have read countless others.  But this is the ONLY one I will read again and again, and enjoy more and more
0451169514|5.0|No one captures the essence of childhood better than Stephen King does.  &quot;It&quot; is a primary example of this fact.  One of Stephen King's lengthiest books but well worth the read.  Stephen King gets constantly criticized for writing horror and his lack of originality.  But the novel &quot;It&quot; beg's to differ that assumption.  This is a tale of horror, suspense, fantasy, friendship, and most important of all what it feels like to be a child.  A lot of people think that an interest in horror is unhealthy.  They only see the monsters, the evil, the darkness.  What they fail to see is that most of Stephen King's novels are displays of human endurance.  To this day I still have nightmares of Pennywise The Clown.  The fans of Stephen King will always appreciate what he has created: a world of sight, wonder, and amazement
0446520950|5.0|Who'd have thought that he could top his last book called, &quot;Absolute Power&quot;?  But David did it!!  This one is even better.  There is more of the mystery element in this one-a real &quot;who-done-it&quot;.  Can't we rate a book as an 11 and  1/2?!  The question of &quot;who-done-it&quot; will keep you hopping through a whole  host of suspects.  the key characters in this one are the kind that you just  hope will return in the next book like Jonathon Kellerman's Alex Delaware or  Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta.  David Baldacci writes a better intrigue  than Grisham and consistently writes them so that they are impossible to put  down.  Even his Author's Note's in the back of the book are great!!!  I, too,  can't wait until the third book!!  I wonder if this one will become a movie,  too?  It would certainly make a great one!
0553328255|5.0|a great book. i would like to read it over and over until i know the hole book by heart
0385424736|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  After being very disappointed with The Client, and somewhat bored with A Time To Kill, this was a reminder of how much I enjoy Grisham (The Firm, The Pelican Brief).  Looking forward to The Partner
0060171928|4.0|I hope there is truth in what I read. I did not think the author portrayed the indigenous peoples unfairly, in fact, quite the contrary. The wisdom is timely and allows other indigenous cultures supporting voice in a time when nature has been marginalized to a serious degree. I highly recommend
0802130208|5.0|The funniest book I have ever read.  It says a lot about a book when you can be reading it alone and laugh so hard your side hurts.  A wonderful book.  Sorry to say anyone who doesn't love this book--has no sense of humor.
006016848X|5.0|This is an excellent book to help understand the differences between men and women. Even if you are in the best relationship, it will help you to communicate your feelings and know what your partner is thinking. A must for anyone and everyone
067972768X|5.0|I read The Joy Luck Club after watching the movie and it was still as interesting to read as it was to watch the film. What seperates the book from the film, is that the book goes more into detail about the women's lives. What I like most about this book are the stories from China. Even though I can't relate to any of the breathtaking stories I like to read about the early days of women in China. These are the stories that can't be learned in a textbook. They are personal stories passed on from one generation to another
0440180295|5.0|This is the finest book I have ever read.  Humerous and sad in the same moment.  It makes a statement about the author's experiences that can be applied to experiences in our own lives.  The story is almost a satire with a writing style that cannot be improved upo
0553269631|5.0|It amazes me that Mc Cullers wrote this book at such a young age.  Her characters speak of worlds and ideas that most people wouldn't dream of at 23.  Her portrait of Mick, a troubled adolescent, is wonderful, touching on the myriad of stormy feelings that a 13 year old goes through.  Her depiction of Singer leaves an open interpretation; he becomes what you want him to be.  Each character is so alone, so unique, and so human.  Her statement on the human condition -- ultimate lonliness -- is strong, yet doesn't leave you as much sad as thoughtful
0385176228|5.0|I dont know how it sounds for american culture but for me as a Turk, the book is a must-read. Are you sick of all that surrounds your life (ok, most of what you're unaware of) ? Then let the book takes you to another world where you live (as the pages go) a life the way you could have imagined (sure even more).  I dont know the american versions but in the turkish version the text is printed in two colors. If you are in the real world the color is green but if you are there (namely fantasia) the color changes to be pinky.    I love pinky since then !
1573225517|5.0|Ten pages into this book, I found myself wondering why I hadn't noticed Nick Hornby following me around all these years.  This book touches on almost every aspect of modern love, from relationships with in-laws to one night stands to realizing too late that you've lost the only person you've ever really wanted to be with.  Seldom have I read a book that seemed such an accurate vocalization of everything I've experienced in my relationships.  I learned as much about myself as anything else while reading HIGH FIDELITY, and it should probably be required reading for anyone about to start or about to end a relationship
0385424736|3.0|I found &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; entertaining, but not the best Grisham. I know most readers did not like &quot;A Time To Kill&quot;, but I found it better than &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;
0887306101|5.0|Jack Schwager interviews the top traders in futures, options, stocks, and commodities.  The casual interview style is entertaining and easy to read but contains a wealth of strategy.  Not only do you find out why these traders are  so successful, you find out why the vast majority of traders are not.  This book is highly recommended
0440211727|5.0|&quot;A Time to Kill&quot; is the best Grisham book I have read. It engage you into the character. You will feel the sadness, the helplessness of the characters. This book is hundreds times better than the movie. &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; is a Must Read book
0553573411|4.0|There are many things I am enjoying about this story line (Over two books so far).  o The main character is a bastard, born from a Prince (King-in-waiting) and a common woman.  I have enjoyed how far the author has taken this in the Kings court.  Where most of the people have looked at him as bastard, leeching from his King, hating him, the King himself has made him a tool which he uses in the background (an assassin), just like the King's half brother.    o The next piece of imagery I like is how the author has portrayed the concept of &quot;being a king's man&quot;.  Where the main character and his father figure have put duty above everything else.  Atypical of how it is usually done, the characters have put there king or prince in the forefront accepting everything he does as what is right.  They are ignorant of how that effects other people like there lovers.    o There are many conflicts which are happening over the story line, but two of the larger ones are coast vs. inland and six duchies vs. outslander
0316921173|5.0|David Foster Walece's novel Infinite Jest is a story of addiction, but not just drug addiction. Sure, some addicts in this magnificent book are hooked on drugs. One amusing (and disturbing) sequence  is a stream of consciousness rambling by someone who is waiting for a kilo of marijuana to be delivered so he can get high for the last time, but his damaged brain and paranoia keep him from making a decision as to whether he should try to get in touch with his contact. But there are others hooked on sex, sports, old movies, M*A*S*H, radio programs, tennis and even an addiction to breaking an addiction. The story takes place at a tennis academy near Boston in the not too distant future. It just so happens that a halfway house for recovering addicts is just down the hill from the school. Hijinks ensue, but not your typical crazy students vs. the rest of the community a la Animal House. The irony of the situation is that what goes on at the school is, in its own way, identical to what goes on at the halfway house, i.e. folks pushing the edge of the envelope just to see what they can get away with. The author shows us that one can become addicted to just about anything to the point of excluding everyone and anything else from their life. He see it every day: the rituals that people follow and their need for acceptance in a world where their quirks, some physical, some psychological, make them just a little bit different. That's not to say that the book is gloomy and serious. Indeed, it is a satirical look at the future of the country. Years are no longer referred to by a number; they are sold to corporations who subsidize the country in exchange for the free publicity, an idea the former lounge singer President got from attending a New Year's Day Bowl game. People are comparing David Foster Wallace to Thomas Pynchon. I prefer to just let Wallace be Wallace.  Prepare yourself. This is a hefty read. The plot meanders in time and location and some times you wonder &quot; where did that come from?&quot; Fear not, loose ends are tied, often with a surprising knot. Two bookmarkers are necessary: one to mark your place in the text and one to mark your place in the footnotes, a couple of which are chapters unto themselves. Having a PDR and dictionary handy wouldn't hurt, either. And don't stop until you finish it. And when you do, just flip back to page one and start over. After all, if one reading can be this entertaining, just think of the buzz you'll get from two
0440213525|5.0|If you like the movie &quot;The Client&quot;,  you will like the book better. This book engage you from the beginning. Reading this book is NOT a waste of time and you'll never regret reading i
0345363132|5.0|I read this book straight through on a long flight overseas. I could not put it down.  A lover of history and one always  for the underdog I found myself drawn to Richard III in this  book.  Maligned by history through the ages, he is now seen  in a heroic and beloved light.  I prefer this Richard to the   one history so often portrays.  Fast paced, even the battle   scenes kept me drawn into the story and transported back into  the 15th centruy.  Sharon Kay Penman is a master story teller of   medieval England.  I look forward to reading her other novels.  She is tops on my list and I recommend this book as a robust   read!!!!!
0060926317|1.0|I believe in free speech, but this book is a terrible abuse of that principle. The author is getting very rich from sales of this book, while the Aborigines she purports to admire have their wishes ignored.  The local Aborigines deny ever seeing her, and say that she has grossly misrepresented their culture. It is just another form of cultural imperialism dressed up in New Age language.    The author has ignored the wishes of the local Aboriginal people, who have repeatedly asked her to retract her statements. She blithely continues her best-selling run, apparently without a care in the world for her subjects.    I don't agree with censorship, but this would be one book that deserves to be left off the shelves. That amazon.com is *promoting* this book in its Spotlight is a great disappointment to me.
0316545856|5.0|Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in jail, imprisoned by the government that he declared not representative of the people. And yet, after 3 decades of hard labour, he came out  of jail not looking for revenge, but looking for liberation  for his people, the very liberation that had him imprisoned  in the first place. A long walk to freedom is written by a man, larger than life, and written by candlelight whilst the guards weren't watching. It tells the sad tale of a country   facing the brink of disaster, and the man who, whilst using   violent means, saved a certain civil and bloody war. This book should be prescribed reading for everyone!
0812550706|5.0|I had to buy this book in hardback because I kept wearing the paperback version's out.  This is a story you will read again and again. A disturbing view of the future with suprises in every chapter
0679745203|1.0|I found the book to be slow moving.  I never felt a connection with any of the characters and, thus, didn't find the story worth finishing.<br /><br />If I didn't read a lot I'd have gotten a complex from my feelings towards this book.  While everyone else is ranting about it, I found it a good cure for a couple nights of insomnia!
0345315227|2.0|Astronaut Frank Poole (remember? HAL booted him off into space in 2001) lives again. His frozen corpse is retrieved from beyond Neptune's orbit and he is revived to become a &quot;national treasure&quot; of the third millenium, at least until he finds a more interesting calling as potentially the only person with whom Dave Bowman &amp; HAL (now existing in some form inside the monolith watching over Europa) may communicate and share insights concerning an impending threat to humanity. Most of the book plods along steadily, but without much effect. Entirely plausible, if unexciting, descriptions of the living environments and technologies of the third millenium are intertwined with minimal plot development. The climax of the story is, unfortunately, greatly diminished in impact by its (apparently) entirely coincidental commonalities with ID4.  And, despite the book's title, the door seems to remain ajar just a bit (4001?). Overall: happy ending, no sex, no violence, easy reading, good footnotes. This one is probably mostly for die-hard 2001 and Arthur C. Clarke fans
0671701800|4.0|First published during the mid-1980s era of nuclear jitters, Sagan's novel borrows its premise from the 1952 film &quot;Red Planet Mars,&quot; in which astronomers get in touch with our planetary neighbor by broadcasting the number &quot;pi&quot; (and receive, in response, a broadcast of the Sermon on the Mount). While much of Sagan's book now seems quite dated technologically, and bound up in the context of the late Cold War, it's still an entertaining read, and one that might lend encouragement to aspiring future scientists
0553260111|5.0|Jason Bourne's memory is gone.  Who is he?  Is he the world's second most respected assasain, an agent gone bad, or an innocent man trapped in a web of incriminating circumstances?  He must find the answer to these questions so he can go on and live his life, with or without the woman he loves, or be killed in the process.    Yet another Ludlem book that is irresistable to those who like a book that will you guessing.  It was almost impossible to put down!
0131103628|5.0|This book is not only a clear, concise, interesting introduction to C; it's also a great way to learn by example how to write clean code.  Both the text and the sample programs are well thought out, easy to read, and simply intelligent.  I'm not too familiar with other ways of learning C, but I'd hazard a guess that this is by far the best.  It's simply a wonderful book
0679731377|5.0|A &quot;History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters&quot; by Julian Barnes is a collection of ten and a half short stories or essays that are loosely connected.  Very entertaining and contains many different angles on love, fear, belief, and incompetence, from Noah's ark to a post-apocalyptic world.  All of which add up to a quick history of the human condition
0385486804|5.0|John Krakauer has written a remarkable book about the life and death of an enigmatic young wanderer and idealist who met his demise in the Alaskan bush.  I've known Krakauer's writing from my 20+ years of reading Outside magazine, and the article on which this book expands -- and his account of the Mt. Everest tragedy -- rank among the best the magazine has offered.  In this book, the author has taken his exhaustive research of Christopher/Alex McCandless' life and retold it with such clarity that one feels a part of the events.  Krakauer also skillfully draws on the lives of other young men -- and, indeed, his own life experiences -- to explore the idealism and sense of adventure and longing for self-discovery that led Chris into the circumstances that led to his death by starvation.  As one who aspired to the kinds of adventures Chris lived out for the final few years of his life -- but never took the bold step of hitting the road in search of them -- I was greatly moved by the telling of this story.  The astonishing honesty and introspection by the writer and the family and friends of Chris McCandless makes this an unforgettable story.  Krakauer was criticized by many Outside readers for &quot;glorifying&quot; the story of Chris McCandless' death in the original magazine article (and he answers these critics' points very effectively over the course of the book), but I think anyone will find this an absorbing, thoughtful, and revealing book.  And for those of us with a bit of Chris' wanderlust and search for freedom in our past (repressed or not), this should rank near the top of the must-read list
0671701800|5.0|It is not simply about science: it's about personal achievement, polotics, religion and human relations, about a dream you have for your life and pursue until you get it.<br /><br />This was the first sci-fi book most of my friends read and they simply loved it.

0684874350|5.0|If you only read a book a year - make this one it! The hardships of life brings the reader to happily ever after. Find yourself smiling in the midst of sadness, relieved and with a light feeling while submerged in a gripping tale. The author takes us on a love-hate journey yet we all stay happy in the end. I wish I was Oprah ;  then I could recommend this book so it reaches millions of home - where Frankie's story really belongs

0679745203|5.0|Michael Ondaatje at his best!  Memories of war, love, deceit, and passion flashes across like strikes of lightning.  The minds of four ruined lives intersects to form the story of a man with no name, no past, and no country.  Flash backs brings readers back to South Cairo in the 1930s and the mysterious Almasy and Katherine.  This exceptional story with which the four elements, air, Earth, water, and fire played a vital role symbolically.  Countless layers...worth reading many times.                                                                            TIDBITS FROM THE BOOK --    &lt;&lt;&quot;I just want you to know.

0345315227|4.0|A nice new chapter to the saga, albeit a short one when you  consider a couple chapters are rehashed from earlier books. As a fan it was nice to see the old characters again.    An interesting look at the future but by no means ground breaking.  Mr. Clarke seems to like his early stories a lot to keep revisiting  them (the several Rama books and 2001 sequels).  For someone not familiar with the series, I would give it a 2.  A good read for fans.
0684874350|5.0|I'm usually a slow reader, but was able to finish this book in just 3 days!  I could not put it down.  I really felt very close to each of the characters in the book, especially Frank.  The book is now making the rounds in our large Irish family:  Mom, Dad, Brigid, Kathleen, Charles .... So far each of us has nothing but high praise for it!  Now when can we expect the sequel????  Excellent work Frank!  God bless you!
0880389052|5.0|Of all the authors out there, Bob Salvatore has really taken the fantasy world by a chokehold.  In this chapter of Drizzt Do'Urden's life, the young dark elf realizes the problems of living in the Spider Queen's nest and having the heart of a valiant warrior.  A cruel act of fate sends the excellent student from innocent child to broken man.  He strikes out at a world that is cruel and unjust, only to learn that the world he wishes for will take a lot more searching to find.  An excellent read.
0393316041|4.0|Genius. <br /> That's a word that we throw around a lot nowadays.  Anybody who reaches the top of their field, comes up with a new and brilliant observation or dramatically changes the way people do things is usually branded a genius.  <br />  Nonsense.  I call it luck and I call it perserverence.  Anybody can become really good at something if they do it their entire life.  The true test of genius comes when somebody becomes an expert as something that they just started working on.  <br />  Richard P. Feynman is one of the most brilliant Physicists of our age--but his book is about almost everything BUT Physics.   Feynman spends a little more than a paragraph discussing his Nobel Prize, and spends more time on the subjects that interest him even more, such as bongo drums.   More time is spent covering Feynman's escapades in Las Vegas than his lectures at Cornell.  <br />  Feynman was a junior engineer on the Manhattan Project, but anybody expecting any deep observations about Oppenheimer, or any essays about the morality of nuclear energy will be disapointed.   Instead, Feynman relates to us his stories of mischief in the New Mexico desert.    <br />  And who WANTS to read about Feynman's lectures in quantum mechanics?  Who WANTS to read about his Nobel Prize?  There are plenty of textbooks on those subjects.  Feynman would rather tell us about his loves, adventures, and observations outside of the classroom.  Feynman seems happier about being able to pick the locks of the world's most expensive safes, choreographing ballets using nothing but bongo drums, and outsmarting everybody that he comes in contact with.  If there were Nobel Prizes for curiosity, mischief, and all-out general smart-aleckness, Feynman would have to make multiple acceptance speeches.  <br />  Equal part Stephen Hawking and Hunter S. Thompson, Richard Feynman has led a life rivaled only by that of Forrest Gump.  But Feynman, instead, actually goes looking for adventure, and when he can't find it, he usually creates it.  <br />  A must read for those people who want to know if there is life beyond Physics.
0440211727|5.0|This is Grisham's first book ever published.  One of the greatest storys I have read lately.  Puts the reader on the edge of their seat
0880381736|5.0|I always read Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman books whenever I see them. This time I bought it for my brother and could not put it down. Can't wait to read the rest of the series
1567184855|5.0|I have never before believed in reincarnation until I read this book.  I was convinced that after we all die, that is the end of it.  We all go to heaven and live their the rest of our spiritual lives. This book is INCREDIBLE!  I have suggested it highly to all of my friends who are interested in spirituality books. I CANNOT say enough about this book!  I have just about every spirituality/occult/paranormal book there is.  Either that, or I have seen/reviewed most of them.    This book IS a &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; for your personal library.  Once you pick it up to read it, you will not be able to put it back down.    HIGHLY SUGGESTED BOOK!
0380715430|5.0|Takes us straight to the heart of the what it means to speak the modern tongue. From the shores of the Angles tribal past, we view the grand sweep: the  pubs of their present, the ghetto and the cafe,  the pawn shop and the the streets of Coney Island, the volcanic experience of Shakespeare (who in a short span created many thousands of words)--all of this and more alongside us as we speak--until we glimpse  the  moveable boundaries of our own era atop the shoulders of history. An incredible achievement
0671721720|5.0|As a sub sailor I READ a LOT and Honor Harrington (the heroine) is one of the BEST books written. I have 3 copies and 2 are worn out!  Way to go David Weber and I WANT MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!
0812550706|1.0|I was interested in this book because it's gotten so many strong reviews -- both positive and negative --from other readers of Amazon's site.  Unfortunately, the author's smooth command of language and subtle characterization were flawed by the fact that the text is colored dark navy and appears on black pages, thus making it virtually unreadable
0385472951|5.0|The book starts with a bang and never slows down. Patrick,the main character, tried to outfoxed the lawyers,feds,and the media only to outfoxed himself.Great rea
0385472951|5.0|I find myself thinking I shouldn't like this book -- the characters aren't particularly sympathetic (and most of Grisham's books do have characters you root for) and the writing isn't great -- but this man can tell a story!  While the story doesn't make you think or rethink your stands on serious issues (e.g., death penalty) as many of his other books do, and very likely this wouldn't happen to anyone you know, it's a great read!  I couldn't put it down -- reading just one more chapter and then one more and so on to find out what was going to happen.  This will be a great beach book and, obviously, a good movie.  So sit down and enjoy it
0385472951|5.0|I read this book very quickly because of the constant changes that occured in it.  The plot is very exciting, even more complex than ones contained in The Pelican Brief and The Runaway Jury.  I highly recommend this book to others who have found Grisham's work to be of high quality
0385472951|5.0|John Grisham has out done himself!  After the first page,  the pages seem to turn themselves.  As I read this book, I found I had as many questions as the author had answers.  The constant legal twists and turns in the story kept me riveted.  Grisham keeps the reader interested with the number of players in the plot but has buried a further thought in the reader's mind.  What would it be like to start life  over? New and fresh--what a fantansy!  Although, I throuoghly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly, readers BEWARE!  The ending is not expected and rather dishearting.  Nevertheless, it will not overshadow the pure enjoyment of the read
1573220485|5.0|Alex Garland's &quot;The Beach&quot; conveys the mentality of a young traveler to a haunting degree of accuracy.  The protagonist experiences events with a laconic but barely definable attitude, as he continues on his journey without passion or purpose.  As a former back-packer myself, Garland stirs emotions and non-emotions in me I thought I had left behind
0446520950|3.0|I enjoyed the novel.  The plot was intriguing, and it held my interest, however there were some anolamies.  Strong female characters in fiction writing are becoming more plentiful, which I thing is outstanding.  Cases in point would be the protagonists of Patricia Cornwell and Phillip Shelby.  The V.I. Warshawski character is also very well rounded.  Not necessarily so with Sidney Archer of TOTAL CONTROL.  While she presented a strong sense of will in continuing to learn the fate of her husband, she was also a character who continuously made idiotic decisions that put her in danger.  Going back to her office to decrypt the disk was extremely poor judgement for a woman who is continuously hailed throughout the novel for her intelligence.  Also I felt that she was far too emotional for her own good.  There comes a time in the story when the woman must stop crying, and sobbing, and move forward to resolve her problem.  It seems that Sidney could not get through twenty pages without breaking down into tears, which I found very tiresome.  I feel David Baldacci is an excellent writer.  As a creative writng major at the University of Arizona, I believe I can learn from him, but I feel he could learn more about female portrayals in novels
0385472951|4.0|No, I did not love this character, but I did admire the way he had every angle thought out. The book was hard to put down and I know I ignored my family while reading. There were many twists and turns in the story although I also found the end to be quite predictable. I enjoyed the book but am also sorry I finished it so quickly
0312853254|5.0|For those who enjoyed the fast pace of Enders game,  this book will seem like a shock.  For those who have a  deep understanding and feel for science fiction, this is   a must have.  This is one of the most captivating books of  our time, and should be required reading.
0385472951|5.0|Finally...after having been drawn into following Grisham's<br />work with his first four books, I had become sorely disappointed with his last three efforts.  The Chamber and the Rainmaker, although good stories, were too much of a let down and the Runaway Jury, I am sad to say, has been one of the most difficult books to read and I have yet to finish it.  However, The Partner was a fast, non-stop read that kept me interested throughout the entire book.  The Partner is reminiscent of The Firm, but this time Grisham sets forth an intriguing story that starts at the end and eventually presents the reader with most of the details of the true story (or is it??).  The main character, Patrick Lanigan, can come across to some as a 'bad' guy and to others a 'hero' and that's the beauty of the story - the reader is able to make his/her own decision on why they want to root for Patrick or against Patrick.  At the end, after you have twisted and turned and think you completely understand the story, you realize that there are even more stories that could go on about this complex, intelligent (or not so intelligent) bad guy-hero.  I heartily recommend the lastest Grisham novel, not only for those who have never read Grisham, but also for those of you who may have lost interest and felt Grisham had perhaps fallen into the 'formula' writing that can become boring and predictable.  Renew your enthusiasm by reading The Partner!  I did.
0899663036|5.0|The most amazing aspect of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is its universal appeal  to readers of any age, any race.  Opening the covers of this book is like  stepping into a time machine and visiting the squalor of 1920's Brooklyn, N.Y.    Here Betty Smith's descriptive magic plunges you into the ugliness of poverty   and the beauty of the people who fought to overcome it...  Francie Nolan, a dreamy child who finds her escape in books...  Johnny Nolan, her handsome young father, who finds his escape --   and ultimate tragedy -- in the bottle... and Katie Nolan, her beautiful,  hardened mother, who realizes that education is the only way her children   can escape the life she is forced to endure.    Although this novel was written many decades ago, modern readers will find   the prose to be shockingly frank and as realistic as it is descriptive.    The only fault with the book, which covers the span of Francie's life from   birth until college, is that it eventually has to end.    No history text can make the past come alive the way &quot;A Tree Grows in  Brooklyn&quot; can...no movie can leave its audience with more satisfaction  from a story well-told.  I dare anyone to read this book and not come   away a different person...it is, in fact, a true work of art.
0446343129|5.0|When I read Sugar Blues the first time, I was already struggling to eliminate refined sugar from my diet because I knew I was addicted to it.  Dufty's book just further supported my suspicions, that sugar is not only extremely habit-forming, but it was also responsible for my flagging energy levels, mood swings, and many other unpleasant symptoms.  This book is a superb combo of personal testimony and well-researched facts, and is sure to make every reader give another thought to eating foods containing this &quot;white death.&quot
0140042393|5.0|** AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT WORK !! **<br /><br />This book changed my way of looking at life!  A multi-level<br /> story (like most of Steinbeck's work). Well written<br /> tale of a simple existence, of suffering without bounds, yet full of optimism for the joy of being alive.
0201633612|5.0|This book really changed my way of thinking about object-oriented design. The idea is that when designing a new class hierarchy, though implementation details may differ, you often find yourself using the same kinds of solutions over and over again. Rather than approaching each design task out of context as an individual, isolated problem, the strategy is to study the task and identify the underlying design pattern most likely to be applicable, and follow the class structure outlined by that pattern. It's a &quot;cookbook&quot; school of design that works amazingly well.<br />There are other advantages to this book. It isolates 23 of the most common patterns and presents them in detail. You wouldn't think that 23 patterns would be enough, but once you become adept at recognizing patterns, you'll find that a large fraction of the patterns you use in practice are among these 23. For each pattern, the book carefully presents the intent of the pattern, a motivating example, consequences of using that pattern, implementation considerations and pitfalls, sample code (C++ or Smalltalk), known uses of that pattern in real-world applications, and a list of related patterns.<br />Upon first reading, you will start to recognize these patterns in the frameworks you see. Upon second reading, you'll begin to see how these patterns can help you in your own designs, and may also start to see new patterns not listed in the book. Once you become familiar with the pattern concept, you will be able to originate your own patterns, which will serve you well in the future. One of the most valuable contributions of this book is that it is designed not merely to help you identify patterns, but to give you a sense of which patterns are appropriate in which contexts.<br />I think this book is particularly valuable to many C++ and Java programmers, because of the dynamic and flexible design philosophy it follows. (Its two fundamental principles of reusable OO design are: &quot;Program to an interface, not an implementation&quot; and &quot;Favor object composition over class inheritance&quot;.) I've found that many C++ books unfortunately tend to emphasize a rather static and inflexible design philosophy. Many C++ programmers do not realize how the language and the books they've studied from have been limiting their thinking until they have been exposed to ideas from other lanugages.  The authors of this book have obviously been influenced by other languages as well, especially Smalltalk, and have brought many of its best lessons to C++ design. Most Java books seem to take after the C++ books, even though Java is a more dynamic language. This book may help Java programmers take full advantage of the extra power offered by their language, if they look deeply enough into some of the lesser-known features its runtime system affords.<br />Last, but not least, this book is valuable because it names the patterns it uses, and so gives programmers a common vocabulary to describe design concepts, rather than particular implementations. You'll find yourself saying things like, &quot;That would be a good use for a Decorator&quot;, or &quot;Should we use a Facade or a Mediator in this case?&quot; I encourage readers of this book to use this vocabulary with other programmers.<br />In summary, this is one of the few books that I think belongs on every programmer's &quot;must-have&quot; list.  Not to overuse a cliche, but like object-oriented design itself, the pattern concept is one of those rare paradigm-shifts in computer programming.  It is equally valuable to expert professional and novice student alike.  The book has a home page at [...]
0312962118|5.0|Meade has written a winner, in my opinion.  I could not putthe book down and especially like the way he kept the actiongoing chapter after chapter.  Meade blends a fictional story line with tidbits of historical facts ala James Michener. He (Meade) quickly develops the characters, but keeps some twists and turns to the last chapters which sneak up on the reader.  The book is well written and fast pace.
0385311400|5.0|Which genre to pigeon-hole the Outlander series into has become a great debate.  What it all boils down to is great old fashioned high Romance in the tradition of Sir Walter Scott and R.L. Stevenson, updated for a modern audience.  Diana Gabaldon is the person everyone would have wanted seated by the fire in the days before TV and radio.  She is a wonderful, imaginative storyteller.  Drums of Autumn is a little weaker than Voyager, but seems to set the stage for more to come in the next two books.  And after all, how much more physical abuse could Jamie take?  Give the man a break.  Please don't attempt a movie, it would spoil the fun
0385472951|5.0|John Grisham goes back to his original legal thriller format with his latest novel, The Partner.  Although the later novels have been well written and well received, Grisham goes back to his formula for success with his earlier titles such as &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;.  A gripping novel with several sub-plots, I got deeply engrossed in the novel and was dissapointed when I turned the last page.  Another late night (really early morning) with Mr. Grisham.  And it was well worth it
0385472951|2.0|The Client again demonstrates that success is built upon the abysmally low standards of the American reader and the resonance engendered in that public by detailing the slime of the American legal system. The book is a tour de force of weaving together a cast of cartoon characters, farcical plot  and a No Henry ending by means of talented prose. The guy can write but he demonstratively lacks anything to write about. Grisham's motto appears to be: Suspend any rational though when you read this book.<br /><br />His books fall into two classes: 1) Hate &quot;whitey&quot; polemics and 2) Action-Suspense without suspense but with random action.<br /> He would please me if he would join forces with another writer who had a head for story line, character development and had a logical mind. With such help, a future Grisham novel could make sense as well as have great surging prose style.
0812550706|5.0|If you need any reason to read this book, scroll down the 12 or so pages of tens. 'Nuff said
055347698X|5.0|This book is a true &quot;mother's helper&quot;. The authors offer  step-by-step guidelines for real-life situations. Best  of all these ideas work!     Most parenting books focus on the symptoms and only   temporarly change the behavior. This book focuses on solving   the underlying problems causing the rivalry.    I highly recommend this book to anyone with children. It   will change your attitude about your children forever!!
0380002930|5.0|When I told my Mom I was gonna read this book, she warned me that it was depressing. I said, what the heck? So, I read this book &amp; cried my little ole' heart out.

0345404998|5.0|Often, when a book is a part of a series, inexperienced readers expect &quot;more of the same&quot;.  Anne Rice has challenged her readers to view her Vampire Chronicles as a work along the lines of a biography for Lestat. The only consistency in life is its inconsistency - and this is aptly illustrated in Memnoch. In Memnoch, we are given the opportunity to see what has been rattling around in the immortal head of an entity that has witnessed centuries of life.  Though &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; gave us a look at his human life as a young man, Memnoch spins the tale of the kinds of concerns one has as maturity takes its toll on the way you were raised to view your relationship to the world. These are fundamental questions asked by humans in every language in existence.  Man is the only creature that engages in pursuits that have nothing to do with survival.  To ask &quot;why&quot; is practically what makes us humans. Civilization is built around the concept that man must make peace with his surroundings - surroundings he did not create.  Open your mind, and you may be taken on a phantasmagorical trip to the darkest places in our nature.  It is a frightening place to go, but a trip worth taking
0451452739|5.0|Perhaps the best advice I can give for anyone considering reading this book is that this is the first serious book I remember reading and have read thousands of others since, This is the book that got me hooked on reading and realizing that there was a whole world out there just for the takin

1574530011|5.0|There is no such a thing as THE BEST BOOK to have read; there is however a group of books that marks one's life and are often remembered. Same as the group of tunes or group of life's events... Gaarder's book has found a place in my own group of books to always remember. A real jewel in a sea of overdone scripts. A web of ideas, historical facts, fantasy, moving insights into the life of a young woman, a cleverly architected (yet never to overwhelm the reader) sphere of self-reflecting reflections. Too bad it has only been published in linear paper; a hypertext would be a much more appropriate medium  --- Some day..
0312853238|5.0|I found this book on a shelf at nine last night, and started reading it, because of a good recomendation by a friend.  I didn't stop reading until five in the morning, when I was too tired to hold the book anymore.  This is definitely the longest amount of time I've spent reading straight, yet propabley the shortest amount of time I've ever finished a book in.  To sumarise this book, what it all leads up to, I have one sentance.  At age 11, Ender Wiggin anihilates a whole race, on accident.  The characters in this book are so wonderfully developed that, while you hate them, you understand them.  You love them, hate them, you understand, you empathise.  And Card leaves you your imagination, your -brain-
0679745203|5.0|&quot;Ah, love, let us be true<BR>  To one another! for the world, which seems<BR>  To lie before us like a land of dreams,<BR>   So various, so beautiful, so new,<BR>   Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<BR>   Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain...&quot;<br />   --Matthew Arnold, 1867<br />      If you've seen the movie, you'll find that the book concentrates on Kip and Hana, not Katharine and the English Patient.  The novel, unlike the film, is really two intertwined tales of great loves which are lost and should not be.  And both loves are lost for similar reasons.      The movie is astounding. So is this novel.  For different reasons.
019282760X|5.0|Pride and Prejudice had me hooked by the first page. It was so amazingly colorful and witty that I read the whole thing in less than twenty-four hours. I couldn't put it down. If you like reading a book that sends you off in twists and turns that throws both irony and realism in your face, then you'd better not delay. The book is about a twenty-one year old girl struggling with three stupid sisters and an arrogant mother, with only her father and elder sister as her true friends. Even though it was written almost 200 years ago, you'll be able to recognize the similarities in human behavior that has followed our species since the dawn of time, in this remarkable romance. So true is the title..
0385472951|2.0|I read the other reviews and still don't understand what anyone liked about this book! A Grisham fan, I was very disappointed by this dismal effort. There was no real impetus to root for any character. The book is like a slow ride downhill. You can see the ending, and there is no thrill. I kept waiting for 'the good part'. A nice little twist at the end.....but it's too little, too late
1556154844|5.0|I agree wholeheartedly with all the reviews, both from amazon.com customers and from the industry reviewers.  This is a must read if you consider yourself a programming professional.    The thing that distinquishes this work from others in the genre is that it is readable from cover to cover, and it's practical.  I've read too many books that never leave the theoretical plane, and it's a chore to wade through the material.  Not this one...  I enjoyed reading the whole thing, I saw the application to my work immediately, and it caused me to re-examine things I've been doing for 10+ years.  It was well worth the money spent (even though my company DID pay for it!)
0385472951|3.0|Not the John Grisham of &quot;Hard To Kill&quot; and &quot;Pelican Brief&quot;, never the less a very interesting plot. The ending is given away much too early. I would like to see Mr. Grisham spin a plot around Leah on the run hiding from Michael and/or Sandy
0151001820|5.0|&quot;The Club Dumas&quot; is the perfect change-of-pace work for mystery fans who are tired of the same old-same old. Presumably, everyone here at amazon.com loves reading, and loves books. &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; provides us with a gripping mystery set in the high-brow literary world, surrounding the reader with tales of the literary classics and vibrantly giving life to long-dead authors and long-forgotten deeds. Though written in Spanish, the English translation of the work far surpasses most of the genre in its beauty; the words lyricly flow past the eyes in an exceptionally hyperliterate structure. Anyone who has ever read Alexandre Dumas will be surprised and delighted by the similarities in the style of prose.
0694517208|2.0|This book did have some enlightening ideas but still placed the burden of a successful relationship squarely on the woman.  It continuously stressed that the woman should be more loving and giving and understanding.  Sorry, but it's a two way street in a relationship, with EQUAL responsibility
0385472951|4.0|Keeps you interested with the plot twists and legal subtleties, somewhat like The Runaway Jury, but not as exciting. The ending is a bummer
0385472951|1.0|I am very disappointed by Grisham's effort here. His writing has become completely droll and predictable.  Am I the only person getting tired of the same downtrodden Mississippi lawyers fighting the same corrupt agencies while being completely perfect and omnipotent at the same time. His writing has become a complete bore.  The only saving grace in this overly melodramatic sob story was the intriguing ending. My suggestion is that you read the dust jacket and the last ten pages, then go find a classic to convince yourself that good literature is still out there somewhere. Maybe even in Grisham's world
0385472951|3.0|STARTED OF WELL BUT BECOME TOO PREDICTABLE. SEEMS LIKE GRISHAM IS ONLY WRITING LEGAL THRILLERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE MONEY - HE HOPES TO BAG $90 MILLION FROM THIS PROBABLY. I HAVE READ ALL HIS BOOKS AND NONE COMPARES TO A TIME TO KILL.<br />ALL THE REST ARE A EASY READ BUT NOT MUCH DEPTH IN HIS LATEST EFFORT. I'D LOVE TO SEE SOME MORE LIKE A TIME TO KILL,PELICAN BRIEF OR THE FIRM.
1556154844|5.0|This material is not taught in school, but it should be.  This book is for the guys in the trenches, the ones who actually do the construction.  It takes a pragmatic approach to the tried and true software engineering principles that are used by the industry's best engineers.  The novice and expert will benefit from reading this book.  And that's the beauty of it.  When Steve makes a claim about a trend or characteristic that is seen in many software development processes, he backs it up with hard data from documented studies.  It's like a Jedi Warrior listening to the wise advice of Obiwan Kenobi.  It's filled with golden nuggets of knowledge.  The text also functions as a Handbook.  Topics are grouped so that the reader can go to a single section and extract the desired material without having to bounce all over the book.  The art direction, graphics, organization and layout is the absolute BEST I have seen in a book on programming.  When going into battle, put this book in your backpack

0312854021|5.0|A truly gripping story. It sucked me in and held me until the end. I would recommend it to anyone. A must read. Concerning some of the other reviewers and their comments pertaining to Ender's Game's inadequacy when compared to &quot;great literature,&quot; I would have to say they are partly right. Card did not go out of his way to bury deep philisophical truths and social commentaries into the plot of Ender's Game. Ender's Game is not Steinbeck, but then Steinbeck is not as much fun to read :), and I think that is the point. I believe Card intended to write to as large an audience as possible by writing a terrific tale and appealing to the one thing common to every person: emotion, and he succeeds in every way. The 'truths' and 'ideas' of Ender's game are not masked and buried deep, which unfortunately seems to be the indicator of great 'literature' these days, they are brutally laid bare and made accessible to every reader. The great thing about Ender's Game is its power as a tale. It weaves so well, the reader has no choice but to be sucked in and experience the world and heart of Ender Wiggin. So for those who rated it a 1 because it isn't a &quot;literary masterpiece,&quot; you're right. But the comparison is irrelevant. If I judged Ender's Game as a fudge popsicle, I would be gravely disappointed and give it a '1' as well. Card wasn't attempting to write a work of great 'literature' when he wrote Ender's Game, he was trying to write a great story to be read by all. And a great story he wrote.
1556154844|5.0|The book is at its best when it puts forward an idea (and discusses alternatives), supports that idea and makes you laugh at the same time.

0156528207|5.0|Tender, spirited, and written from the heart. Most adults seem to make the mistake of believing that growing up and growing old must by neccessity go hand in hand. It is all to easy to grow jaded and cynical in an age more interested in what you own, not who you've become. Growing up is fine- the acceptance of responsibility and the maturation of values attendant to that process. Growing _old_ is something I've fought all my life -- and it was gratifying to see a book that so beautifully crystallized everything I've believed about the truly important lessons from life
0679745203|5.0|What a smooth and effortless delight.  You are initiated into this marvelous plot almost unconsciously.  A must for every reader
0140049975|5.0|It would be trite to call this the greatest English-language book ever written.  That would be too car salesmanish.  The back of the book tells you it's about the struggle between two brothers.  I feel that's oversimplifying it.  It's about the struggle about a group of people from prostitutes to farmers to soldiers to children to geniuses to simpletons to millionaires to hobos.  It blends Western and Eastern philosophies and makes you realize that at the core, most beliefs are the same because most people are the same.  And infinitely  different.  But this isn't only a philosophical romp for over 700 pages.  The prose is some of the most beautiful I've ever read.  A passage about a rabbit getting shot with an arrow moved me so much I read it about 10 times when I first encountered it.  The book took a long time to read not because it was difficult, but because I kept going back over and over.  The problem I've found with novels this long is the author's seeming inability to finish it gracefully if at all.  But here, the final scene couldn't be held together better and be more satisfying.    Yes, you do need to get through the first 50-100 pages, but after that, you'll realize it was a labor of love
0893860220|5.0|This book can show you the way of how to put all questions in a correct perspective. It's amazing how a almost illetrate man can have such a deep thinking. You seldom find any citation of another thinker or philosopher. Nisargadatta speaks of his own personal experience. Try it. It can add a lot on your thinking way of understand the &quot;world&quot; around you.
0425156842|5.0|Blah, blah, blah. Sound familiar? I bet this is what you usually hear immediately after the word \\"philosophy\\" (not to mention \\"history,\\" \\"literature,\\" and a slew of other topics related to learning). Have you ever even had a remote urge to read a book on the history of western philosophy? More importantly, do you know any kids who have had such an urge? Picture sitting in the kitchen one day when your son or daughter comes in and says, \\"Gee, mom, I'd really like to read a book about philosophy. Just for fun.\\" Heck, most kids don't even know what philosophy means. Well, this may be about to change.  Sophie's World is fun and light hearted, sure to be enjoyed by everyone from pre-teens to adults. The genius of the book is the way a brief, yet comprehensive, summary of the history of western philosophy is smoothly integrated into the story. You hardly notice you are learning (in fact, it's probably best not to mention the \\"L\\" word to any kids you give the book to).    The book opens with young Sophie receiving a mysterious letter in the mail. Thus, with the help of a friendly stranger, she begins her quest towards self discovery while trying to unravel the mysteries of life.    As an added bonus, American readers will also learn a little about Norwegian culture (for example, in Norway you always answer the phone by saying your name, a habit that will seem strange and amusing to most Americans).    All in all, this book has everything to recommend it. After reading it, you are sure to pass it on to your friends like I did. Definitely a must read.
0385472951|5.0|This book rivals The Firm in suspense and storytelling. I first thought, ho-hum,were can Grisham go with a lawyer skipping out with a lot of money and maybe murdering someone to cover his tracks.  The book is a page turner and is entirely plausible. I can identify with burnout and that feeling of wanting to get away. I can't wait to see who will play whom in the movie
0679735909|5.0|A. S. Byatt's Possession is a masterfully constructed novel. Two Victorian epic poets fall in love; two twentieth century scholars, trying to interpret their poems, are drawn into   their affair.  Byatt has invented all the Victorian poetry, and she serves it up in portions which contain the literary clues that the scholars, and you, the reader, are searching for. A wealth of details, among them a lime-green Volkswagen, link the Victorian characters to the contemporary ones. Thus, the novel is a double mystery, a double romance, a beautifully formed story.
0131103628|5.0|The introduction credits Ritchie with originally developingth the language, so it seems unfair to leave his name out.  Also, I don't think ANSI is part of the title.

0345373243|4.0|I waited for 'Belgarath the Sorcerer' with great expectation; hoping to finally know more about Belgarath with his mysterious past; about what really made him the man he appears to be in the Belgariad and Mallorean series; to really know the history of the Eternal Man. In this aspect the book lived up to my expectation, yet I was disappointed in a way. There seems to be some humor missing in Eddings' approach to the whole story. The beginning was entertaining enough but then it started to get boring. This might be caused by the 'I' (that is Belgarath's) point of view of the whole story. I personally think the Belgariad series is the best work Edding has done, with the Mallorean series following close behind. I still take up a book from these two series and still feel the thrill of turning each page to reveal what happens in the next pages (despite the fact that I've probably read the whole thing a dozen of times). It's still worth the time reading it. This is not the same thing I can say about Eddings' prequel to the saga. I haven't picked up this book and read it again from cover to cover since the time I finished reading it for the first time. However, devout readers of Eddings should definitely not miss this book since it offers more insight to the Belgariad realm. It's nice to know more about Belgarath, but this book lacks the thrill and humor of Eddings previous books, which just proves the point that history is not meant to be entertaining
0425132153|5.0|Fans of either Neil Gaiman or Terry Pratchett will love this  book.It tells the story of a reluctant anti-christ, who  having been switched at birth, is raised as a normal boy. When Adam and his friends decide to destroy the world  and start again (kids, eh?) he realises just how much  resonsibility he has for the fate of mankind. This book has everything, humour, likeable (and more to  the point convincing) characters,and an exciting plot  leading to a climactic ending. For a book about the  Apocalypse there are thankfully few morals
0345315227|1.0|3001: The Final Odyssey is a simply horrible ending to what has been one of the greatest series in science fiction. By answering nearly all of the questions and tying up neatly all the loose ends from 2001 et. al., this book effectively destroys that wonderful sense of mystery and intrigue that was the heart of what made the other three Odysseys such wonderful books. It's a similar effect to if the X-Files suddenly revealed all of its secrets, except the Odysseys are longer running (and, in my opinion, even better). Also I was hoping to finally see HAL return (after his disconnection in 2001 and abandonment around Jupiter in 2010), but instead all we get is this awful quasi-Dave Bowman who's really rather uninteresting as Clarke's characters go. I did like the long vision of the future in this; I always like to see the perspectives on it of great authors like Clarke, but it takes up far too much of the book to be significant (only about half of 3001 is actually concerned with the plot; the other half is just Poole's experiences with the future). Finally I thought the plot in general of Poole returning was a bit weak; surely Arthur C. Clarke could have invented something more imaginative than that dime-novel trash. Overall I think 3001 was a pathetic ending to what has been one of the greatest series in science fiction history, and wish Clarke had simply left well enough alone with 2061 and not destroyed the whole core of the series with this trash
0345315227|2.0|What I've always admired about Arthur C. Clarke's writing is the sheer poetry he managed to meld so successfully with the narrative. The city glowing like a jewel on the desert in &quot;The City and the Stars.&quot; The arrival of our primal fears in &quot;Childhood's End.&quot; The wonder of the artifact in &quot;Rendevouz with Rama.&quot;  Sadly, most of the poetry and the wonder was missing from his later, collaborative books. And although Clarke's physical difficulties have prevented him from writing more single-author novels in the past few years, I wish he had passed on authorship of 3001 to someone else. Then I would have been able to remember him from his past triumphs.    Although 3001 would have rated a 7 or 8 from a lessor author, from the past master it is a 3 at best. The narrative is rudely broken by what must be Clarke's thoughts of the world at present. Circumcision and religion may play a valid point in any novel, but the way they are addressed in 3001 reminds me more of Gernsback's polemeic Ralph 124C41+ than it does of the Clarke I look forward to reading. His opinions interrupt the narrative and do so in a way that doesn't advance the story line. Unforgivable in an author of his stature. Most of his 40-year-old short stories evoke more of a sense of wonder than this novel does. The mind &quot;sees&quot; the printed words in a book. 3001 requires significant allowance for myopia and astigmatism.    Wait for the paperback. Or better yet, wait for the Sci-Fi Channel adoption of the book. It couldn't be worse. Unfortunately, it might even be better.

0140072187|5.0|Whilst this book concentrates on the Vietnam experiences of a helicopter pilot, it also captures &quot;the way it was&quot; for all combatants. With clarity and immense detail, Mason reminds us of that incredible transition from civilian to soldier many of us went through and how miraculously the processing enabled us to cope with events and experiences of the war. The coping lasted until the end of your tour or until you were &quot;full up&quot; and getting a little frayed at the edges. A major element in holding men together in the insane stresses of combat is the fact that all those about you are doing the same thing - and nobody wants to be the first to crack. The resulting scenario is hundreds of men seemingly cruising unaffected through a roller-coaster ride in hell.  Using the same dry humour and understatement that was part of survival tactics at the time, Mason takes you on that ride, but kicks you in the stomach with an ending you struggle to comprehend. Meantime, Mason's plain English descriptions of learning to fly choppers are so breathtakingly realistic the average reader could jump in a Huey and take it for a joy ride on the first reading. This is one of those books where, on turning the last page you want to pick up the phone and chew the fat with the author

006097625X|5.0|One of the highest functions -- and the most difficult -- of mankind is communication. The ability to translate concepts into pictures and symbols that accurately relate the substance of your thoughts -- this is the challenge.  Scott McCloud has created a triumph of communication. You, the reader, are easily and instantly transported into his universe, where you will journey on a wild, thought provoking tour of not only comics but all venues and dimensions of visual art.  In its own way this is a book as significant as Doug Hofstadter's &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach&quot; but MUCH more accessible through its simple graphic novel format.  Even if you've never read a comic before and have no plans to start, you will still be captivated by this journey through history, art, and creation

0679745203|5.0|As a writer and teacher of literature, I've read many good novels in the last 5 years. In Michael Ondaatje's THE ENGLISH PATIENT, I've found a novel that achieves &quot;greatness.&quot; Such writing is why I first fell in love with literature...the novels of Hemingway, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, William Faulkner, Gertrude Stein, and Sherwood Anderson. This book has a masterful control of plot, characterization, themes, and style. And yet it reads like a dream...compelling and clarifying, ultimately revealing. I know Ondaatje as a poet of myth and mystery, of personal detail and intuition. I am struck at how much of that he brings to this novel. It is a inspiration, in part realized by the THE ENGLISH PATIENT film by Anthony Minghella under Saul Zaentz's production. The only thing the film has added are a few scenes to capture relationships; everything else you'll find in the book, including a deeper sense of theme and significance. It is, quite simply, the best book and film of our decade.  -Larry Smit

0872860175|5.0|Ginsberg - The name flashes at you like some familiar face in a crowd of a thousand faces.  He grasps every thread of the Beat Generation and embodies it in his work.  The poem &quot;A Supermarket in California&quot; details a mystic journey into the thoughts of a Wandering writer who, in such a mind, asks &quot; ...and you, Garcia Lorca, what were you doing down by the watermelons?&quot;  The book &quot;Howl and other Poems&quot; wonderfully pieces together some of the most enticing and thought-provoking works of Allen Ginsberg.  This book allows you to sample poems from the reknowned &quot;Howl&quot;, to the light airiness of&quot;Asphodel&quot;.  At one time, Ginsberg was compared to the genius mind of Walt Whitman, by using the similar style of repetition in his poetry.  Now, Ginsberg is noted for his own syle of Genius, and his use of &quot;mental tatalization&quot; that simply cannot be compared with any other, even those in the Beat Generation

0679745203|2.0|I began this book with a very open mind thinking that since it was given such grand reviews I would like it.  WRONG!  I kept reading thinking it would get better.  When I finished it I thought, SO?  I could not see how this could be made into one of the great love stories of the century.  The characters were not fully developed, but  I continued to read thinking I would eventually come to the great love story and I would become excited about the plot.  It never came.  The narrative by the English patient did not tell me of any great love.  Just a fling behind the husband's back.  I was very disappointed by this book

0316921173|5.0|An early review of this book refered to Gaddis and Pynchon.   Now every thing written about this book includes them.  Does anyone out there have an original thought?? Wallace has more in common with Jerzy Kosinski and Martin Amis at the peak of their powers.  He is the first great writer of our generation.  I have never read anyone so young who had so much (almost too much) to say. Man oh man does Wallace have a lot to say.

1573225517|4.0|I am a Japanese male living in Tokyo. I have an office job. I am about 10 years younger than Mr. Hornby, or Rob Fleming, the protagonist. I am basically a jazz fan, and few of the songs mentioned in the book have any meaning to me, not to mention the fact that the tapes I made for my (might-have-been) girlfriend was more of a cause of misunderstanding. <br /> Why am I writing this? It is because I want to emphasize that &quot;High Fidelity&quot; was a great read for me, a person who, unlike most of the reviewers here, cannot associate myself or my acquaintances with any of the characters that appear in the book (not even The Most Pathetic Man In the World). Because of that I cannot give it a rating of 10, but I think the book is enjoyable to anyone. I guess I cannot speak for women, but I am glad to know that they enjoyed it as well.

0679405496|5.0|On the splendid visual backdrop of turn-of-the-century India, 'A Passage to India' is a timeless and classic masterpiece of English literature, poetically exploring relations between rulers and subjects, men and women, Englishmen and Indians. Forster's lucid style and unsurpassed technical ability comes together in a carefully crafted and delicately balanced work. With great sensivity and sincere love of the country, he conveys to the reader the full emotional spectrum of the cultural mosaic of India, from the most deeply felt pious devotion to various religious duties, to the unfathomable chasm of misunderstanding between natives and colonial rulers. On an higher impersonal level, Forster weaves an exact and finely constructed plot with almost supernatural undertones, as if the characters are drawn imperceptibly and unknowingly towards their fates by forces within the land itself

1563523302|4.0|The authors present curious information about the wealth of America's millionaires.  For example, information on the cost of clothing is derived from answers to questions like &quot;what was the most you've spent on a pair of shoes?&quot; from people who are admittedly their &quot;own favorite charity.&quot;  Similarly, the authors interpret wealth as something valuable, but, it seems, nothing useable.  Once a millionaire changes intangible worthy valuables to tangible, real, useable assets, the tax man will take a large portion of it away.  The book leaves me with the question: What good is it to amass large stores of wealth if only to be able to calculate and recalculate wealth - and never to use it to further life's enjoyment?  The authors don't even advocate liberating some of that wealth onto adult children or others who might apply some of its value in enjoyment.  I did enjoy the interpretation of offensive/defensive wealth and how most Americans are good at offensive wealth building -- we are a culture based on income levels.  However, we could stand some lessons rather than scolding on how to be better defensive wealth builders -- i.e. less consumption.  But I return to my primary question:  what is the value of wealth, in accumulating wealth, if it is just to to be accumulated and admired (valued) but never touched or enjoyed?

I enjoyed it thoroughly. <br />I feel that the attitude of Mr. Pirsig and his alter-ego protagonist Phaedrus have many things in common with a Zen practitioner. The motorcycle, by the way, is his modern-day lotus flower.
067942850X|5.0|The best books are the ones that leave you vaguely disturbed and somewhat unsettled.  Just like leaving the movie, &quot;Evita&quot;, humming &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, you will find your mind returning again and again to this haunting story and the in-depth way that Jon Krakauer brings us further and further into the deeper realms of Christopher McCandless' psyche. <BR> I, like many people, was somewhat unsympathetic upon first hearing of Christopher's death in the bus in the far reaches of Alaska.  I thought of him as stupid for going so poorly prepared, but the book changed my opinion about the person as well as the circumstances surrounding his death.  Mr. Krakauer managed to give us the facts, the feelings and the humanity surrounding the adventure without dipping into the maudlin or sensational.  Simply put, the author reached further and pulled out a higher truth.  <BR>  I have a lust for the road that cannot be explained in my day to day existance.  I found that Krakauer's book, &quot;Into The Wild&quot;  helped me to understand my own need for adventure and dropping the social conventions.  It had a healing touch which suprised me.    <BR>    I'm sure you who have a passion for exploring and leaving civilization behind with find this book fascinating and real.
0553573411|5.0|All three of the books in this series spun a tale that kept my fingers turning the page.  It was an engrossing story with believable characters that all had flaws and petty hatreds that made them seem real.  The last book wrapped up a little quickly, but altogether, it was a good read and left a perfect opening for several sequels.  All of which I would read
0553266306|5.0|The plot is well-focused, easy to understand, fast-paced, and very credible. The atmosphere stunningly chilly. The technical details are still immaculate, though surpassed by recent master technothriller Clancy.<br /><br />This novel may not send chills down the spine in the way it probably did 25 years ago. Time, however, have given this novel a sort of vintage quality, a certain &quot;class&quot; that Clancy and Ludlum can only dream of. It used to be that the only way one could read this novel was to stay up all night, even reading while in bathroom or kitchen. Now in 1997, you can sit back and take your time to enjoy it.<br /><br /> I would like to comment on the remark of an anonymous reviewer, who said &quot;The Jackal is much more entertaining in the hands of Ludlum&quot;. The Jackal in Ludlum's &quot;Bourne Identity&quot; is based (though exaggerated beyond credibility) on a real-life terrorist I.R. Sanchez a.k.a. The Jackal, who in turn was nicknamed so after the fictional assassin of this novel.
0679441018|2.0|Memnoch the Devil is not, I repeat NOT!!!, a Vampire Chronicle.  At least not in my opinion.  My question is why did Anne Rice, who is the master of weaving a character and breathing life into him, chose Lestat to be the protagonist  of such a religiously baised novel?  I loved every one of the Vampire Chronicles, couldn't wait to get my hands on the next one, but this one threw me for a really large loop. Earth circling you coulds say.  I don't know waht I expected but it certainly wasn't what Memnoch gave.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the book and have read and reread it on numerous occasions, recommend it to friends---but not as a continuation of the storyline established for Lestat in Interview with a Vampire. It is a different genre of book from the vampire tales and I, personally, object to it being included in the Vampire Chronicle series.

0385472951|4.0|It was interesting from the beginning and it kept you on theedge throughout the book.  It made you want to help the partner figureout how he could get out of this.  Then when he figured out a way, I was so happy for him I stood up and screamed.<br /> The ending he has is not fitting and so unnecessary and it did not put a closure to the book not unless he is writing a sequel to the book and Lord knows I hope not. But other than the ending this was a marvelous book and very very good reading and I truly enjoyed it and I would pay 20.00 any day for another book like this one.

She pays great attention to detail and has completly researched her topics and settings. I always come away with a sense of loss when her books are through as though I won't be seeing good friends for a long time to come. I look forward to her next books.

0440213525|5.0|I'm Isaac, a 10-year-old that lives in Columbia Missouri, and even I liked it. If your thinking about getting one of Grisham's books, I suggest getting The Client. It's a wonderful price on this website too, lots cheaper than regular bookstores!!
0345315227|3.0|In the latest book, in what has become the &quot;2001&quot;series, we find not only an uninspiring, but implausible plot.  Sure,there were some interesting ideas and Clarke's linear extrapolation of the future is fine, but as a novel, it just doesn't ever &quot;take off&quot;.  When I read the &quot;2063&quot; book, I felt that Clarke had produced a novel only to commercially exploit an original and brilliant idea (that is, the 2001 book).  In &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey,&quot; I felt that while a good read (have you ever anything that doesn't read well from Clarke?), it lacked the well defined imaginative classic qualities (like the &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;).  In fact, while reading the novel, I was disturbed by the narrow historical references (only back to the late 20th and early 21st centuries).  This is where Clarke could have painted a highly imaginative picture of the future and provided linkage between the &quot;now and then&quot;.  There were also a series terrific storylines that could have been developed that would have
0517702967|1.0|I wish I had checked these reviews before I picked up the book.The jacket description promises a &quot;contemporary thriller&quot;but the book delivers far less.  Maybe Follett was trying to turn a quick dollar on the book and sell the rights to TV, but &quot;The Third Twin&quot; delivers all the sizzle of &quot;Brenda Starr.&quot; The plot is completly predictable; the characters, one dimensional; and Follett's political agenda becomes tiresome. (Actually &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; is better--most of the readers care what happens to Brenda.)  If you want to read a good book, I suggest you forget this one and try Follett's &quot;Pillars of the Earth.&quot;
0385472951|4.0|I read this book after reading the reviews by other individualsand for the life of me I don't understand why they found this book tobe one of his worst.  For me it was non-stop reading until the end.  I do agree the ending was something I didn't expect and thought it was unrealistic. It could have found a better ending.
1573225517|5.0|I read (and re-read) and then shared the book with a couple female friends I had worked in record stores with.  We can't believe Nick Hornby wasn't one of our regular customers!  Unbelievably accurate characters and dialog
0385485786|5.0|Here's a book to lure all legal-eagles, or those who suffer<br />from attorneyphobia. Grisham gets the juices going with a painful sequence that sets the threshold for what's to come. However, you have to admire his plot-weaving skills and his character portraits are spot-on. If you have imagination, you won't need to see the movie that we're sure will follow.<br />Love that dialogue.
0060975768|5.0|General Moore's sobering account of the First Air Cav. in the battle of Ia Drang shows you, the reader, just how the war in Vietnam was, up close and dirty. This book is recommended for anyone with and interest in the Vietnam Conflict
0385472951|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst of Grisham's novels. The concept is a good fun story, and it will probably make a decent thriller (Tom Cruise kind of roll), but unlike any of Grisham's other books, this one has not one likeable character!<br />It's a difficult task to read a whole book with a protagonist sans any redeeming qualities. I'm glad I didn't buy a copy--my Dad lent me his after he finished it.

0345315227|1.0|&quot;Arthur C. Clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time,&quot; says the publisher's blurb. By who? _3001_ contains maybe 25 pages' worth of story (though &quot;story&quot; is putting it too strongly), padded out to ten times that length by self-indulgent prophesying and preaching, in amateurish prose that makes you cringe several times per page. And when, after 150 pages of this padding, we finally get to the actual story, Clarke fails to provide us with the most important and potentially interesting part of it, the actual message whose warning of impending disaster finally sets the real plot in motion. Ironically, the best writing and reading come in the nonfictional source notes and valediction at the end of the book. For addicts only, and they might want to wait for the cheaper paperback edition, which surely won't be long in coming
0887307876|4.0|At first, I bought this book only because its cartoon drawing  and I like humor a lot. Yes, indeed it contains a good humor material and made me laugh. However, for several chapters I found a very similar resemblance with actual situation in my office, especially chapter about &quot;Employee strategies&quot;, &quot;Performance reviews&quot; and &quot;Engineers..&quot; ( I am an engineer, that's why I knew that Scott's view of this area is accurate). Then I realized that this book not only offers funny cartoon drawing and naughty advices, but also good advices! The secret is, you have to know which advices you could use and which you shouldn't. You can determine that with a combination of your office situation analysis, your IQ level, whether your boss also has this book or not, and ...luck! In short, this book is recommended
1559723505|5.0|The Highly Sensitive Person by Elaine N. Aron is one of the most important books I have read.  Ms. Aron is both a HSP  (Higly Sensitive Person) and an accomplished Scientist.  It  is this unusual vantage point that gives the book its 3 dimensional depth.    It is estimated through a combination of genetic predisposition and less then perfect parenting in the first   few years of life that 28% of the American Population are HSP to a greater or lessor degree.    This sensitivity which probably becomes physiologicaly built in is a double edge sword.  On the plus side it allows this class of people to be particularly   aware of their envirionment.  This allows this group of people to get great pleasure from nature or the arts.  Being aware of their environment the are sensitive to other peoples feelings and tend to be associated with the gentler professions such as philosphy, judiciary, psychology.     However, in the buisness world that is measured in nanoseconds and the individual is lost in a soulless mass market the HSP is susceptiple to becoming overwhelmed.  Like a deer in a headlight.        The author then gives meaningfull suggestion on how the HSP can overcome and live with the limitations of their personality tendencies.  In this light, for an HSP this is truly a self-help book on a par with &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;.         Professor Aron warns us that through out history HSP's  have been the socializing impulse behind the warrior king.  They have added the humanizing values that make life worth living.  It is ironic in this age when technology and science is giving us more and more power and control over nature,  there seems to be a corresponding lack of morality and search for meaning in society.  A culture that doesn't protect and nurture the possitive characteristic of Highly Sensitive People does so at its own peril.       I would like to talk to Professor Aron to discuss with her the possibility of starting an organization toserve this large number of people.
0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn is wonderful fantasy tale for children and adults alike. Although no longer carried by most libraries, the book is still a wonderful tale to read and re-read many times over. Written by Peter S. Beagle, &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; gives one a sense of viewing another time and place seperate from the outside world yet within the minds of us all. Being  the only Unicorn in the world gives her a quest: to find what happened to others of her kind. She becomes mortal for a brief period, and is the only unicorn that has ever loved a human being for more than a short time.     During her quest she meets King Haggard, who is never happy except when he sees the unicorns he has had the Red Bull (some say the Devil himself) capture them all and imprison them within the sea.    Molly Grue, an old yet still pure maiden, joins the quest early on and points Schemdrick the clumsy yet powerful Magician, a person who is under a spell to remain immortal until he has become a true wizard. Molly becomes a valuable
0553260111|2.0|I agree that this is a page turner, but that't about it. The plot is incomprehensible. The &quot;man-woman-crisis-love&quot; scenario is too easy and corny. What? The protagonist just accidentally gets spotted in an obscure bar on the day he makes his comeback? Give me a break. People get killed all the time, while Jason Bourne and his girl miraculously gets away. Does Mr. Ludlum think that a high body count is essential for a thriller? Also, his story of high-level conspiracy is too wacky to be credible. <br /> All in all, this novel reads like a very complicated version of a James Bond movie. It is my second Ludlum after &quot;The Chancellor Manuscript&quot;, a novel which the comments above applies equally well. This will be my last Ludlum.
0394573552|5.0|Some say that there is a bit of sadist in everyone. Thiscertainly is my case, since I reveled in the somewhat perversepleasure of reading this book and watching the spectacular fall of Sherman McCoy, the central figure.   <br />   Bonfire of the Vanities is a book about New York in the late 1980s, when bond traders like McCoy ruled the universe. I understand that it has become a cliche to say that the novel is better than the movie. In this case, however, the disparity is so great that I would actually recommend you see the movie.
0446520950|4.0|Enjoyable because of its twists and turns and the research that underlies the action.  However, did any reader wonder why Jason didn't ask his lawyer wife about how to deal with what he had found at Triton.  Maybe, even though she worked only 3 days a week, she had outpaced him career-wise and he wanted, by himself, to give her the financial freedom to do what she really wanted -- to stay home with their daughter. If that's the case, then the idealized love he and Sidney shared rings hollow.  If David Baldacci checks out these reviews, did you possibly have this in mind
0440178002|4.0|Set at the end of the feudal period (c.1600), this novel is (very) loosely based on real events.  Mr. Clavell's characterizations were true-to-life.  The premise of the story is familiar to many through the TV mini-series.  An English pilot guides a Dutch privateer to Japan in flight from the Spanish.  Due to a variety of political pressures, religious and financial factors and mostly to his personal magnetism, courage, skill and luck the pilot (John Blackthorn) becomes a pawn and a personage.  His patron, Toranaga,is Clavell's avatar of Ieyasu.  Must read
044022165X|4.0|Though this may not be &quot;great literature&quot;, The Rainmaker is absolutely essential to anyone who looking for legal employment.  I am one such person, and the trials and tribulations of Rudy Baylor have become very personal to me.  This novel is sort of the Candid for those in my shoes.  It shows our hardtimes (humiliating interviews, fruitless mass mailings of resumes, and trying to pay off law school loans) in a larger, more comical light.  In fact, I would recommend The Rainmaker for anyone getting a little discouraged in their attempt to find a place in the world
0345350499|5.0|My English teacher, a fellow &quot;anglophile&quot;, reccommended this treasure to me after a long discussion on King Arthur.  This book is one of the greatest sagas I have ever read. Bradley's characters are all excellent, and are not the usual &quot;perfect fantasy people&quot; that exist in many other inferior novels.  Everyone has their own weaknesses, especially Morgaine, the central character.  I have to say that I was reluctant to read a book that contained so much paganism in it, but I quickly came to understand exactly what paganism is.  I can assure you it's not what most people tell you.  Bradley is not afraid to portray these legendary people as merely human
0385472951|4.0|It sure kept me reading and, for most of the book, on the edgeof my seat.  Until the ending, that is.  I really wonder what Grishamwas thinking when he decided upon the ending.  Or was he thinking?<br /><br />Overall, I liked it a bunch.  I'd read it again if I knew there was going to be different, more satisfying ending!
0899666930|5.0|Persons think that Frankenstein is a little horror show like the old movies that were made. But the orignial Frankenstein is not a simple horror story but a great, sentimental story about a monster who wants to be like anyone else but his look doesn't give to him the possibility to be happy. He will fight his creator to punish him  for the monster he'd done
0451169514|5.0|&quot;It&quot; is perhaps one of the gratest horror novels ever written, simply because of the fact that the story focuses on the characters as much as the horror elements. He dedicates much of his prose to the seven kids that first encounter the terror, using multiple flashbacks, and original points-of view which leave you mesmerized. There is one minor problem about the novel: it's about 50 pages too long, but most probably King wanted to achieve that epic feeling that is only reachable with big, fat stories like this one. One thing's for sure; you'll never forget characters like Bill and Ben, or monsters like the fearsome It, after you read this book.  An excellent read that I highly recommend
0385485786|4.0|Lots of twists and people getting what they deserved as the book wore on.  Somehow the ending appeared hurried or just not well thought out.  It was like a good date gone awry after the lights went out.  I just didn't know what hit me, but I knew I wasn't satisfied
0385472951|4.0|The character of Patrick Lanigan was very much reminiscent of Nicholas Easter in &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;. It was almost as if they both shared the same thought process. I attribute this to the fact that the novels were written with such a short time span in between that Grisham did not have enough time to evolve a totally unique protagonist. I also felt that Grisham did not develop Eva's character in a way that would allow the reader to accept the ending of the story. Throughout the book she was made to seem totally devoted to Patrick and her father. For her to do what she apparently did in the end was totally out of character. On the other hand, I enjoy Grisham's style of starting his books with the climax and then filling in the details that surround it. This style of writing has the advantage of immediately drawing the reader into the story. The delight comes not in trying to second guess the protagonist, but in finding out all the deceptions and intricacies woven into his story. Altho
0345315227|5.0|It's an excellent book and a moving final to the Odyssey series; It represents the bright future that awaits to the human race: Its expansion through the solar system. Together with the stirring representation of the equatorial ring, the colonization of the jovian-luciferian satellites and the enhancement of the human mind with the &quot;cap&quot;, it does a very good story and work, as a one of the best sci-fi pieces I've ever read. With all due respect to all those fellows that didn't like the book, quoting Mr Clarke, quoting to an american president: &quot;It's fiction stupid!&quot;  Bravo Mr. Clarke!

0316921173|5.0|It is awfully ironic that a book about addiction in its many forms is one of the few books in recent years that I have been unable to put down. Likewise, it becomes ironic that we actually take the time to carefully read footnotes and look up the words we don't know (and trust me, this book is full of them) while reading a book in which obsessive-compulsiveness plays such a hefty part. I am an English student that have had the pleasures of taking classes taught by both this book's author and his mother (he teaches at ISU in Bloomington, Illinois; she teaches at Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois)and I promise you, young writers can learn alot simply by reading this 1,079 page opus. Single-handedly, one of the best books I have ever read, writers might be advised to read it twice. There's no way to catch it all the first time

0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt's story of growing up in beyond poverty  in Ireland catches the reader's attention and heart  almost immediately.  You will find yourself drawn to young   Frank and his miserable life.  There are times when you find   the book so sad you might want to stop reading, but please  don't.  This is a true story, and during that time life was   hard, very hard.  His descriptions from a child's  viewpoint never cease to amaze the reader -- how many of us   could write from the perception of a child, and do it so   well.  Be prepared to laugh out loud at certain points.       You would be smart to buy this book instead of taking it out  of the library.  It is a rare book that you will want to   underline your favorite passages to re-read to yourself   or someone else.  Mr. McCourt is an exceptionally talented   writer and I, for one, am anxiously awaiting the sequel to   this fine work!

Into the Wild does a great jobexplaining why one must venture out into the great outdoors to come face to face with his true self. It's a great story, and because the author has first-hand experience similar to that of Chris McCandless, his writing has a special empathy that cannot be affected. As someone who has lived in New York City for several years, I found this read almost as refreshing and head-clearing as a real trip into the wild.

0140379851|5.0|Creating Matilda, the super, extraordinary child with such a big heart, yet again- Road Dahl has done is best.    Matilda was born with crummy parents who didn't  care about a single thing except money, and  a brother who did nothing but to eat, sleep  and watch the telly (television). Matilda  feels lonely, but with her love of books, and her unique intelligence, everything was already a bit alright.    She met a teacher, Ms. Honey, who had a kind  heart, but like her, was lonely. Ms. Honey  had a deep secret she wouldn't tell not to a  single soul, and Matilda is just destined to  help her.    But there was one problem- Ms. Trunchbull,  the biggest, meanest, creepiest, principal  you ever met in school. Just say one word  when she's talking and you'd be thrown down  in the chokey, or do something against her  rules, and be thrown out of the window. That's  what I meant. Someone had to stop her, though,  nobody dares to.    Matilda finds out she had supernatural powers,  and she knows she needs to use this, to make  everyone -who deserved it -to be a happy, including herself.    Read this book and find out what's next...this  book is one of Roald's best and I think children  of all ages could learn at least something from  this book.

6302798450|4.0|Sam Raimi is a twisted genius. If you haven't seen the other Evil Dead movies (this is technically Evil Dead III) it's sort of hard to describe. The hero, Ash, is a square-jawed &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; type who seems to be forever plagued by demons. They tend to possess various parts of his body and make him do all sorts of machocistic things. (At the end of the last movie, he had to chop off his demonically possessed hand, then grafted the chainsaw he used onto the stump.) As this starts, he's been hurled back into medieval times and has to fight demons THERE, too. The key to these is that they're FUNNY, along with the horror. It's hard to describe, but if you have a strong stomache, it's hard to find better entertainment. There are in-jokes to everything from the 3 Stooges to &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, mixed in with the blood and ichor. This one goes a bit more towards comedy than its predecessors, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's on cable a lot, check it ou END

What would this world be if we all related to life, love, and other mysteries in the same way?

0679735909|5.0|I rarely read fiction these days (not much time, as a graduate student), but I read &quot;Possession&quot; at the instigation of a friend of mine, who was having trouble &quot;getting into&quot; the book.  I managed to stick with it, through the first couple of chapters  --  and then I was hooked.  &quot;Possession&quot; is a stunningly subtle, well-crafted novel, and if you stick with the rather slow beginning, I promise you a tantalising journey (and it IS a journey!)  through the rest of the book.  Very, very clever.  This is the kind of novel/romance that I like to read  -- none of your slobbering heroines or muscular male icons.  THIS novel gives your brain a most satisfying meal!  Enjoy
0345315227|5.0|Clarke writes science fiction, not science fantasy, I thought his vision of the future was very plausible, including the possible sociological evolution of humanity. Admittedly the plot was kind of weak, and it was kind of short, but overall I enjoyed the book very much
0385472951|4.0|The master is back with yet another page turner, that'll beread on many beach blankets this summer. Grisham covers the Mississipicoast like no one else and his descriptions of Brazil are on target, too.  The Partner is full of suspense and strange twists, kept me guessing throughout.  The finish ads, yet, another unexpected twist. Worth the price without a discount<br /> .
0670215821|4.0|Robert Mason does an excellent job bringing the thrill of combat flying to life. You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat, gripping the book as you would the controls of a helicopter as your HUEY plummets toward earth, shearing tree tops and branches in a desperate attempt to gain flying speed and altitude. This is white-knuckle hair-raising heart-pumping action straight from the pen of a bonafide warrior. Don't let the fighter jocks of the world mislead you, nothing beats dirt-eating, air-beating tree-dodging helicopter flying for combat action. Blue skies and contrails nothing, insects on the windscreen and tree branches in the rotors are it
0553260111|5.0|Don't start this book if you have something to do or someplace to be.  Jason Bourne is the alter ego of most people, complete with the double life and danger we all fantasize about, with one catch--he doesn't know who he is!  Robert Ludlum weaves a fantastic tale with all the espionage and intriguing detail his readers are accustomed to.  All this combined with an extraordinary portrayal of emotion in the characters and a desparate search for one man's identity.  A word of caution to new and seasoned Ludlum readers alike: This riveting, &quot;I-can't-put-it-down&quot; thriller will have you hanging by your fingernails to the final word
0023305401|5.0|Siddhartha, one of my favorite books of all time, is the story of a young Brahmin (Siddhartha) who is the best and brightest among his social peers.  His entire life is spent in an attempt, which is eventually successful, to find inner peace.<br />  His plight is one that many people can relate to in that it begins with a classic struggle between a parent and a rebellious child who is ready to throw off the yoke of his father's and teachers' ideologies and move on to find his place in the world.<br />  Through many wrong turns and re-starts, all of which eventually lead him to his understanding of life, Siddhartha makes his way successfully.<br />  Some friends of mine consider the book on a lesser level than those books that are considered &quot;classics&quot; of literature.  This is due to the obvious story and lack of hidden meaning and sub-plot.  I, however, feel that what the book lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in applicability and comparability to most people's lives.  It is a book that makes you think. The ironic thing is that the friend of mine that holds it in the least esteem is a person I consider very Siddhartha-like.<br />  Hesse's topics of exploration of religion and self are nowhere more present than in this novel. It is a book worth reading
0679735909|2.0|I really did, and kept reading it even though I found it and the characters lifeless.  It won the Booker Prize!  Shouldn't it have been a little less predictable? A little less tiresome?  But I did read it through to the end and finally found a lovely passage -- the piece about the braided hair.  A Booker author should give us that level of beauty for more than just one or two pages . . .
0812548094|5.0|A true masterpiece of adventure, love and wizardry. Terry Goodkind uses the power of words to weave for us a spellbinding tale of Good against Evil, where the forces of Darkness are relentless in their conquest for the known world and only one man and his love for a woman stands in their way. A true tour de force in Fantasy writing, Terry Goodkind is a master wielder of the &quot;plume&quot;.

This collection of letters between Ms. Hanff and a London book store conveys most eloquently the power of the written word.  Through correspondence spanning nearly 20 years you are offered glimpses of post-war England, 1950s New York, and the life of a struggling writer whose main treat is drinking the sweet nectar of the English language.   Humorous, entertaining, poignant...simply remarkable
1562827693|5.0|<br /> Over and over again Jon Kabat-Zinn offers us a practical approach to living in our own skins and finding a deep place of acceptance of what is.  Through simple, yet compelling, exercises he brings, what often seems to be mysterious world of meditation, into our everyday lives. He shows us that meditation can be as simple as stopping what you are doing and looking around or closing your eyes and taking a few deep breaths. <br />  He also tells us that walking off the path of spiritual growth can be just as rich a journey as following every bend and curve with focused diligence. This is the true teaching of self-accpetance. Kabat-Zinn offers this teaching with ease, compassion and a real sense of humility born from his own experience.  <br />  I teach various forms of meditation and breathing techniques and put &quot;Wherever You Go, There You Are&quot; on all of my class reading lists.
0345403959|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Eddings (with the help of Mrs. Eddings) books at least twice. The only problem I have with any of their books is how long it take for the next book to come out.  This book answers alot of questions while at the same time opens the door for a lot more questions.  I can not wait to read more about Polgara.  I look forward to reading Polgars's side of this story which has ended but keep evolving
0385485786|4.0|This one initially had me cheering.  Since I had it on audiocassette, my husband listened with me.  He was able to see what wascoming -- until the end!  ^MNeedless to say, we were both disappointed.  Usually Grisham's book shows the good guy, or victim, coming out with the better end.  This one, however, proved that observation was wrong.
0385485786|5.0|I'm a Grisham nut.  The Partner was entertaining, thrilling,and really pulled me into the plot.  I found myself feeling as if Iknew the main character, Patrick.  I admired his guts and his intelligence, grimaced when the bad guys tried to make him talk, and loved the ending.  John Grisham can always shock me with an unexpected twist or turn, and The Partner was no exception.  It wasn't quite as good as The Runaway Jury or The Rainmaker, but it'll definately go on my &quot;I LOVE this book! bookshelf&quot;!
0812550706|5.0|Card introduced me to a different kind of fiction here and I am grateful for that in itself. I found Enders Game, as many did, one of those &quot;can't put down 'till done&quot; books.

I fully expect to be &quot;WOWED!!!&quot; when I read sci-fi, and with Enders Game you will be
0425152251|3.0|Why does the author stop at Sartre? He is too brief withNietzshe who is so influential to contemporary philosophy,i.e. poststructuralism.

0679405372|5.0|&quot;To The Lighthouse&quot; doesn't tell a story--it allows the reader to experience it through the consciousness of its various characters.  Woolf gets inside their heads and writes down what they're thinking from moment to moment, creating an intimacy between reader and character I've experienced with no other writer.  The largest portion of the novel concerns a day at the Ramsay's summer house by the sea.  Mr. Ramsay, a once-famous philosopher whose reputation is beginning to wane, entertains two or three of his students, while Mrs. Ramsay, the novel's central character, manages her family and the other guests.  As Mr. Ramsay devotes his energy to philisophical obscurities, Mrs. Ramsay devotes hers to stroking her husband's ego when he needs it, consoling her youngest son James who wants to go to the lighthouse across the bay, and creating a serene, safe space for her guests.  Gradually, a portrait of English family life emerges, and more importantly, an understanding of a woman's place within it--Mrs. Ramsay has essentially sacrificed herself for her family and husband, and has done so willingly.  Woolf reveals these flawed but beautiful people to the reader in a work of art that seems less like reading prose than listening to music or experiencing a painting.  To the Lighthouse is one of the masterpieces of 20th-century English literature
0679745203|1.0|I am a lover of books and enjoy nothing more than a &quot;good read.&quot;  I was looking forward to reading this book prior to seeing the movie, and anticipated an &quot;all-nighter&quot; staying up until the book was finished.  It is a small book, after all.   I was SO disappointed to find it a boring, ponderous artsy-fartsy book which relies on stream of consciousness and endless narrative to tell an uninteresting story.  There are very few books I find unable to finish, but I have put this down three or four times to read another book instead.  Although I keep coming back to it to try to press onward to see what all the fuss is about, I find myself caring less and less.  The characters are shallow and pretentious, and could use more development; the plot(s) entwine and separate but never engage the reader.  Thumbs down!!

0802130208|4.0|...after all, as Ignatious Reilly proves in A Confederacy of Dunces, 10 years of college, a vocabulary that won't quit, and a roomful of Big Chief tablets filled with political treatises doesn't mean you're smart. In Ignatious's case, it just means he's really cynical.   And hateful. If this book weren't so damn funny, it would be awfully hard to spend 300+ pages with Ignatious Reilly. One of the most spoiled, self-centered, lazy, and lunatic characters you'll ever meet, Ignatious has an audacity--like a Don Rickles insult--that makes you laugh in spite of whatever good manners you thought you had.    Surrounded by a cast of supporting characters, who are equally as repulsive in their own way, Ignatious takes you on a journey through the absurd. By the time it's over, though, you have to admit that you wouldn't mind spending some more time on this road.
0553280325|5.0|Another Bradbury masterpiece, this multifaceted jewel shines - even from within it's dark story. The tale of horror is a subtle one, the gothic imagry will remain with the reader, this book slowly work its magic, it has as many layer as it does pages - the loss of innocence, the evil of technology, mysticism, and many others. Truly a thought provoking novel, and a grand old tale of horror in a small American town
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe, in &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, shows the exotic lives and ways of the Ibo people of pre-colonial Nigeria. The ways of the people are so appealing and so well-explained to Western readers, that we feel as though we are gathering yams from the farm, and offering agricultural sacrifice to our long-dead ancestors.    Achebe uses beautiful imagery to show how simplistic life before colonization was. The old-ways of the Ibo tribe are shown to be dogmatic to the main character, Okonkwo, who plays out to be more like a Greek tragic hero than an African farmer. Throughout the novel, are several Ibo words, adding to the strength of the imagery of the Ibo lifestyle.    &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; is a great read for anyone interested in African culture and/or the colonization effects of Western society.
0345315227|4.0|At the outset, I must say that I am a keen reader , first and last (a reviewer last). Arthur.C Clarke lives as they say in our general area of the pond (The Indian Ocean) and has no doubt been a witness to the fracticious and often unqualified opinions affected by one and all, on all and sundry. This should aclimitize him and by inference the many potential readers of the book  the quagmire that any well-known author or any well-read book lover faces. Its a simple problem that has been with us a long long time, it is called prejudice. A new tale is judged often by our expectations from/of the writers tale-telling ability/plotting style and very little from the story itself. Clarke is writer who probably in an attempt not to be bogged down in his own highly respected style of narrative, legitimizable SF, upset the apple-cart of many's expectations. 3001 may by many, not be considered the perfect sequel, if one goes by the negative critical acclaim that it has provoked.   <br /> But is not that the essence of a good book!  <br />  A book that makes one react is more relevant than one that does not, at least in terms of its impact on our collective conscience. Clarke (by the time tested wisdom called hind-sight) been an oracle of sorts in reporting mankinds technological and other tendencies, I for one trust him to be accurate (within some degree) in his anticipations. With due respect to a genuine visonary, I have never been a great admirer of his linguistic style, often sparse and somtimes forced. BUT and this is the most important 'BUT' what he conceives and projects in his tales are signposts, guiding beacons in the uncertain future and that too in very humanistic terms.   <br />  I would reccommend  Mr.A.Clarke to any one, any time, any where, any work, just for the insight. 2001 was and is an icon, Kubrick insured that, can we not make room in our minds for more?

0385485786|5.0|He's back!!!! Truly one of his best. I have read every one ofGrisham's books and although I had a little trouble getting into thisone, once I did, I couldn't put it down!  I read this book in one evening - a record.  I usually like to savor every page but, I couldn't get enough. I enjoyed all the twists and turns and I had to know &quot;HOW&quot; and &quot;WHY&quot;.  Although I did ultimately predict the ending, I'd like to think I'm somewhat practiced at predicting outcomes.  Even so, I must admit I couldn't help but hope I was wrong.  You will ask yourself, &quot;How it could have ended any other way without impacting the reader?&quot; This book certainly has great potential for a sequel - can't wait to see what they have been up to. Wouldn't it be interesting if Stephano helped out....  Movie? Oh, please! (Without the Hollywood butchering). By the way, I liked the movie &quot;Time to Kill&quot; much better than the book.... I don't think I've ever liked a movie better than the book.  ^M<br />^M Thanks, Mr. Grisham. Can't wait for the next one!!
0345403959|4.0|This was the first Eddings book I had ever read.  It got a little confusing here and there as I hadn't read the Belgariad yet.  However, the gaps didn't become apparent until the end of the book and even then, they were passable....if barely.  <BR> Eddings gives life to Belgarath who is now firmly my favourite character.  In this book, you get to see how Belgarath's mind works and what he feels of other people while listening to his witty comments about this and that.<BR> I've read this book at least three times in the past six months as it is quite a good reference to check up with the Belgariad.  It may sometimes get a little boring but there is usually some humour in the form of the narration, or one of the other characters.<BR> There's still a couple of gaps for Eddings to use for his next book Polgara the Sorceress and if it's anything like this, I'm definitely getting out there to buy it as soon as possible....well at least as soon as I can scrape up the money to anyway...
0451452739|4.0|Well, unlike some of the others here, I don't consider it to be one of the greatest sci-fi books ever written or anything like that. (Childhood's End might qualify...) However, it IS a solid sci-fi book, not to mention novellization of the movie. Standing on its own, it's a bit dry, but raises some interesting questions. Mostly having to do with the Monolith and those that created it. However, it is best read as a sort of guide to the movie. It certainly won't answer all the questions, NOTHING will ever do that, but it will give you a lot better idea what's going on in some cases. However, don't take what he says to be fact. After all, when he wrote it, they were still going to send the Discovery to Saturn. (until they realized what a pain making its rings would be) And the ending, I think, is way too literal, although I have no idea how you could have a writen equivilent of the movie's purely visual end. Incidentally, if you ask me, the key to understanding the movie is noting that

094113086X|5.0|I came across this book by accident, the story is un-describe-able in mere words.  It has to be READ to be experienced.  I took the book to work to loan to a friend, and ended up not getting it back until 3 men and 2 women each ended up borrowing it...none of which took more than 2 days (AT THE MOST) to read it.  Very gripping, the best survival story I've ever come across.  It is by far, the strongest yearning I have ever heard of a man's quest for freedom and what that desire drove him through to obtain it
1573220167|5.0|I've been boring people silly, as they wait for me to stop giggling helplessly while I attempt to articulate quotes from this book. I read it on a train and irritated people silly as they tried to block out the noise of my snorts and laughter to concentrate on their own books. I've kept my husband tossing and turning in bed while I was holding my nose in an attempt to stifle my outbursts of hysteria at 3 a.m. Novels don't come much funnier than this. And it's well written. And it's clever. And, astonishingly, despite - or within - all that humour, it's very moving. And I'm not even all that keen on pop music

0887307396|5.0|I don't consider myself to be a &quot;business book expert&quot;, but I do read three to four business books per year, and I found Built to Last to be the best in a long time.  The authors pull together their years of research into some straightforward findings and insights.  What I liked best was the abundance of specific, tangible and practical examples used to support their conculsions and suggestions.  Also, many of the concepts are practical to small business managers (like myself) and department or division heads
0140135154|5.0|I knew next to nothing about art when I picked this book up. I probably still don't, but at least I can now appreciate the value that  \\"art\\" held for the patrons of the arts (specifically oils) during the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.   One learns to appreciate the value these paintings held not only for the patrons who commissioned the paintings but for their peers and the other social classes of the time.  Mr. Berger's theory to a degree is that these oils functioned as a sort of touchtone of wealth and status and, in a socially fashionable, acceptable and clever way,  showcased one's earthly possessions and station in life.  The patron via the painting told the world: I am socially, spritually and, on occasion, sexually superior. This commissioned \\"art\\" was a tasteful one-upmanship show.  The patron called the shots where the iconography in the painting was concerned and the artist, inevitably a man of talent but with expenses, complied. This is not to say that the masters were hacks.But to coin a phrase they knew on which side their canvas was oiled.  Nothing much seems to have changed today, accordiing to Mr. Berger. And here his theory of the function of visual art comes into clear focus. Mr. Berger uses this brief but dense text to do nothing less than show up or expose the power and fraud  of marketing in contemportary society. Society appears to be a universe of unhappy individuals sharing the collective belief that by possessing or rather acquiring certain social icons they will be empowered and/or achieve everlasting hapiness. This is just an illusion of the genius of marketing--which is what the oils did during the age of the Masters!  Interestingly enough, the tone of the book is not ironic but straightforward. The prose is not pedantic or abstract. It does not assume any knowledge of the history of art or of history for the matter. The text contains 155 black and white pictures of different works of art to illustrate his points. I wish they hadbeen in color but I assume it would make the cost of the book prohibitive. These minor points lead me to believe that  this book based on the BBC series was aimed for the mass market as opposed to the academic world.    The conclusions Berger reaches in this age of multi-national markets, globalization and concentration of media  are downright radical. Read this book before it is censored forever.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's masterpiece transcends national boundaries, providing a poignant account of societal devastation and of the human condition.  In eloquently understated prose, the book exposes many of the horrors that lie buried deep within European colonial and Christian missionary history.

0385421982|1.0|Let me see if I have clearly gathered Grisham's plot. A perky law school student and her overbeveraged professor solve the mystery of who knocked off a couple of Supreme Court Justices.

0553103547|5.0|Mr. Martin has written a great book and a worthy beginning to what will be an epic fantasy series 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.  The characters come alive, causing love(the Stark's) and hate(the Lannister's) of them for the reader.  The authors heroes are heroic and the villains are vile.  The political intrigue makes for great reading and adds depth to a genre that, in some cases, can quickly become trite and predictable.  Mr Martin's use of third person perspective for each of his major characters coupled with plots, histories and folklore brings a believability to the story reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs.  The anticipated summer 97 release of the next book of the series &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; has this reader looking in all the right places

Paul recognized it at once-a common assassination weapon that every child of royal blood learned at an early age.  It was a ravening sliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye.  It could burrow into moving flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.&quot;  This &quot;hunter-seeker&quot; was in Paul's room and was set to murder him.  He is the Duke's son and there is much reason to kill him but the question is who is the person or thing that is close enough to control the &quot;hunter-seeker&quot; and also wants to kill him.  The only person he knows of that is close enough is the trusted Dr. Yueh.  Dr. Yueh wouldn't want to kill him, would he
0385472951|3.0|Poor John Grisham.  He pretty much single-handedly creates agenre, achieves blockbuster status with only his second novel, andevery further effort flies off the bookstore shelves and onto the movie screen.  And then, when he writes yet another of his books, everyone bashes him for being boring.^M ^M<br />Like The Firm, this is a novel about a man who is preternaturaly clever at figuring out the details.  The protagonist is the same, although the name has been changed.  I imagine this is Grisham's response to all those people who must have asked: &quot;But didn't they come looking?&quot; There are no surprises if you've read Grisham's other books, and plenty if you haven't.  The most distinguishing factor for this book is a strong moral sensibility that hasn't been expressed since A Time To Kill.  It isn't art, but it is fast-paced and cleverly plotted, which is why you pick up a Grisham after all.
0345315227|2.0|Arthur Clarke is a genius, and when he tells me what the future is going to be like in a thousand years or so, I pay attention.  His future is minutely detailed, and will probably prove true in many respects.  Where this novel fails is in a failure to couple the technological change with humanity.  These people don't breathe and spit and snore; these are illustrations, not characters. The plot isn't really worth mentioning:  there was only enough of it for a short story
0679745203|2.0|I firmly believe that the purpose in writing is to convey information to others.  Mr. Ondaatje seems to have a more obscure purpose.  I found this book unclear, self-consciously arty, and populated with pointlessly enigmatic characters.  I might have enjoyed the annotated Herodotus, so often referred to, but never presented.  The diary of a man in love with the desert would surely have been more engaging and direct than the elliptical, pointless, yet painful relationships we have been shown

0451169514|5.0|King was at his best when he wrote IT. Definiyely his best horror novel and also my favorite of his works. Even through all the complicated manuevering of going from 1957 to 1985 and back, he doesn't lose sight of his primary objective: storytelling. IT is sort of a encyclopedia of horror. IT has contains at least a trace of almost every kind of horror and terror that has been explored in the past. IT has one of the most interesting and structural foundations from what I have read in many years. Unless King comes out with something beyond genius in the incoming years, IT, especially after King's own death, I'm sure will be looked upon as his best work of horror fiction. This is supposed to be King's last story of &quot;reality of children's beliefs in monsters,&quot; and if this is way of creating a entire summary of his books CARRIE, CHRISTINE, CUJO, PET CEMETERY, FIRESTARTER, THE STAND, THE SHINNING, and probably most of all, THE TALISMAN, King has definitely staged a climax to probably King's best era of his development

0140049975|5.0|When I first sat down with this book, I was afraid that it would be soap-opera blather -- sort of a &quot;Great American Novelist Decides To Write a Harlequin Romance&quot; disaster.  Needless to say, I was dramatically wrong; this is the best novel that I have read in a long time.  The story is engaging, but never melodramatic; the characters may be simple, but only in the sense that real people are simple too.  The theme developed in the book is that all struggles between men are struggles of good and evil.  It takes a good writer to be able to write a novel with that theme and never have it seem hokey; it takes a truly great writer to be able to tell the reader, in a short chapter in the middle of the book &quot;This book is the story of good and evil.&quot;  In my years of reading so far, I have read only one story that is this much of a fable yet is still memorable, months later, in vivid detail -- that is, of course, the Book of Genesis (Adam/Eve, Cain/Abel, Noah, etc.).  I am in no way a religious person, but I am familiar enough with the Old Testament to know that Steinbeck's re-telling of the Cain and Abel story is a masterwork.  Read this book, and you'll always have the answer to the age-old &quot;Trapped on a Desert Island With Only One Novel&quot; question

0385472951|2.0|I was excited when Grisham put on a new book as he is one of myfavorite authors, but this book did not live up to his usualexpectations.  It had no interesting plot turns, and Grisham's usual knack for character development and an interesting plot failed him.
0060926317|4.0|Although the author is no literary genius, and the writing was not brilliant, the power of the message cannot be denied.  The similarities between Australia's treatment of the Aborigines (i.e., the propaganda disseminated about their supposed inferiorities, etc.) and America's treatment of our Native Americans and our Black population were chilling.  Of course it would be disgraceful and disgusting if the accusations are true that Morgan exploited the Aborigine people to write a bestseller to enrich her finances.    But all of those issues are extraneous to the message of the book which I found to be profound and deeply touching, especially as I read this at a time when unhappy life situations were threatening to engulf me in depression.  The &quot;Real People's&quot; message brought me back into the sunshine, putting the details of my life into perspective.  As I attempt to encourage friends and family to read this book, I have found it nearly impossible to express exactly how the message affected and enlightened me.  It is my opinion that it is irrelevent whether this is a true story of a small tribe of people, living life at its most basic, or if it is a figment of the author's imagination.  The whole point was the message which most of the reviewers missed in their haste to jump on the author and her motives for writing it.  Who cares?  The value in a book is measured by the gains made in reading it--and by that measure this book was priceless
0312962118|2.0|Glenn Meade depends on too many coincidences to advance the plot of this Cold War thriller. President Eisenhower asks how to stop a plan to kill Stalin when events spiral out of control. The simple answer is simply to put the book down, or grit your teeth until the end of this implausible tale for the limited joy of listing all of Meade's historical inaccuracies. You're better off with the classic thriller writers
0553103547|5.0|GRRM's newest novel, A GAME OF THRONES, is one of the best fantasies I've read in decades. Based firmly in the high-fantasy genre of Tolkien, it combines High Magic with SF elements, and gorgeous prose writing with strong characters and plot elements often overlooked in generic Fantasy writing.<br /><br />I loved and hated these characters, sometimes at the same moment! There are strong themes and echos of our our own history - specifically the War of the Roses - and fantastic creations that I think even CGA specialists would have a hard time envisioning for the screen.<br /><br /> It's been almost a year since I was lucky enough to snag a copy of this book at the ABA, and I'm getting very impatient for book two, A CLASH OF KINGS.<br /><br /> It is my understanding that his novellla taken from AGoT, THE BLOOD OF THE DRAGON, was a finalist for this year's Nebula award, and is also a finalist for this year's World Science Fiction Awwards (aka the Hugos) at this years Worldcon in San Antonio. His work is well worth any awards!<br /><br /> The only reason I gave this book a nine is because I'm expecting a whole lot out of Books Two and Three. I'm wondering what's going to happen with Arya, and Tyrion, and if the Dothraki are headed their way. I'm yearning to go back to Winterfell and talk to the Ravens with Bran, and to the godswood, and find out what lays behind the Wall...
0385472951|5.0|John Grisham again keeps us twisting and turning through asuspense that it is difficult to put down.  Every time you think youcan predict what is going to happen, a new detail catches you completely off guard.  Not to give anything away, but make sure you read every page, this one isn't over until the very end.  Another excellent work by Grisham, whose maturity as a writer is showing more with each publication.
0446520950|2.0|To those of you who are expecting something at least as good as Absolute Power, wait.  Wait for the paperback so you can cut your losses.  The story goes in circles.  The key to a good novel is that it makes you wonder what will happen next.  This book doesn't.  Hopefully, he'll find his voice on the next book
B000002I4S|5.0|This is one of the very best &quot;early&quot; Coltrane albums.  It shows the development of his scale pattern approach to improvisation, and remains quite melodic.    The CD has bonus tracks that number almost as many as the original album, adding tracks from the &quot;Alternate Takes&quot; album.  After listening to Giant Steps for years, it is great to hear the extra solos on these great tunes.  In addition to Coltrane's great sound is a superb rhythm section, including bassist Paul Chambers.  I rarely pass up a chance to check out a Paul Chambers recording. END
1878574590|5.0|Get dark.  Get bloody dark.   <BR><BR> This tale of twisted love and satisfying vengeance breaks the mold of comic art and plot.  <BR><BR>  Sin City comes at you with pummeling force. In pure Film Noir tradtion, the characters are gritty and tough.  The females aren't women but dames.  The Scenes are rendered in pure black and white that adds to the clear distinction between good and evil set by the story.    <BR><BR>  You wont find subleties here.  The plot is straightforward, just like the dialogue.  The action is quick and inventive. The violence gruesome (barbed wire laced with razor-blades to begin with).    <BR><BR>  The true subtlety of this book is its very existence.  Nothing is quite like it.  No one will even dare. Except maybe Frank Miller.
0345404475|5.0|&quot;BladeRunner&quot; is one of the better Sci Fi movies  of all time -- yet it pales compared to the book.    &quot;Androids&quot; is much more than the movie would lead   you to believe. As with all of Dick's books,   beneath the swirling surface lies several haunting   subplots, and as always a bittersweet sense of   melancholy.    If you've never read any of Dick's work, this would be a good book to start on. A caution: I have found some of his work more reminiscent of Burrough's &quot;Naked Lunch:&quot; wild, paranoid and twisted. One has to be in the right mood ...                For further reading I would start with   &quot;A Scanner Darkly,&quot;  &quot;Flow My Tears the Policeman Said,&quot; and   &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;

0679745203|5.0|The English Patient is not for everyone, only for people who want to drown themselves in an opus of words. It is a love story, but it's about the love of desert solitude, of great art and sculpture and literature, of history, of defusing bombs, of stealing artfully, of caring for the dying, of old monasteries, of peoples and tribes and cultures, of passions, and, most of all, of friendship -- and about how love is destroyed by war, nationalism, conventions, and the madness of jealousy
0802130208|5.0|It is quite rare to find a book which can make you laugh out loud.  You have just stumbled upon one that will do this to you every time you read it.  Ignatious Reilly is one of the most dynamically pathetic characters in all of fiction.  Take your time and immerse yourself in this rich story filled with some of the most memorable characters and scenery.  We all have Mrs. Toole to thank for bringing this work to the world.  I am just sorry that this is our only encounter with Ignatious.

0679736646|5.0|This novel, along with &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch&quot;, show PKD at his best.  Underneath the fast-paced SF storyline and the corporate satire lies the question which PKD asks in all of his work:  what is the nature of reality?  &quot;Ubik&quot; goes a long way in answering that question ( at least in the way PKD saw it). To fully grasp what Dick is getting at one needs to read his &quot;Exegesis&quot; and familiarity with the philosophy of Schopenhauer and Sri Sankara wouldn't hurt

0345350499|5.0|The friends I had aquired through Avalon, the births and deaths I had witnessed, the struggles, the intertwining fates and destinies of the characters and mankind. How does Marion accomplish so much with her work? I was introduced to Morgaine, Vivian, and Arthur when I was fourteen. Every winter my mother would bring out her large, well-worn hardback copy and I would watch her reading and weeping and smiling. One spring I asked to see for myself what she found so enthralling, and on Beltaine I found myself saying goodbye through tears of sadness, regret and love. But the wonderful world of fantasy allows us far more freedom than our own mortal world, because, like my mother, I revisit Avalon every chance I get
0425152251|3.0|I am not a Phil student so I picked up the book hoping thestory would take me into the 'World of Philosophy' without thedrudgery of every minute nuance contained within each philosopher's particular ideas/theories.^M <br /> I guess I learned something, the timeline/clock analogy helped put western thought into a chronological perspective, but I'm sorry to say the story itself eventually put me to sleep.^M <br /> The characters themselves had no substance.
0679735909|5.0|I'm always surprised when someone doesn't like this book. Our book group is reading it (at my instigation) for our next meeting and I can  scarcely wait to hear their opinions. I read it  during a snow-storm and 10-day power outage (on  Orcas Island) and was enthralled. It has mystery,  adventure, and romance -- all the elements that  exist in the everyday page-turner, but here they  are presented in a graceful, literary format. I  have since re-read it and enjoyed the writing even  more, once I wasn't so caught up in the plot (and  so cold I could scarcely feel my toes). I highly  recommend it. It deserves the Booker Prize and  more!
4789004546|5.0|This book is one of the best language tools I have found to learn Japanese, but the word basic in misleading. Intermediate is more appropriate. By giving examples of usage, it explains constructions that tend to be &quot;blurry&quot; for English speakers. Also a useful reference manual
0671701800|2.0|I loved Sagan on TV and I loved Cosmos, but I didn't love Contact. Sagan is a great scientist but he's a pedestrian novelist. I'd call him a poor man's Michener. The characters in Contact are stereotyped and dull. Some sections lag such as the exposition of Ellie's childhood which, apart from being banal, was unreasonably long notwithstanding that it ties in with the ending. I also found the &quot;real science&quot; aspect -which other readers have said is the books strength -to be a little elementary and a little skimpy. Seems to me that Sagan spent a lot more time in musing on religion vs science than on the technology or the science of SETI (and he does this via too many  unauthentic long speeches). All in all a great disappointment
1878424114|5.0|I like this book alot!!! It is short to the point and has simple 2-3 point exercises at the end of each chapter that make sense! If you just do one of the things suggested you will benefit - If you do them all? Well - it could change everything.

B000002H97|2.0|Metallica's worst album for all their early fans.  Very slow and moody. It has some good riffs, but most of the album has been very MTV-ized and overplayed. END
0451169514|4.0|But seriously, in response to that notion of&quot;getting there is half the fun&quot;, in the case of It, getting there (the end) was most of the fun; I simply dig King's style of prose and narrative.  But the conclusion of It (and in retrospect the entire plot) seemed silly, to me anyway.  If anyone thinks this book is bad, however (or especially if good), stay away from the mini-series
0385302320|5.0|I enjoyed this book every bit as much as I did the first two. It amazed me that the third book was equally as spell-binding as the first one!  (Although I enjoyed Jean Auel's Ayla books, I wasn't as keen on the books after &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;.) With these books I &quot;paced&quot; my reading so that the first time pleasure of reading them could last as long as possible!  I just finished reading &quot;Drums of Autumn&quot; - after trying to make it last for a month!  These are very good books!  Just right for those long Arctic winters here in Barrow
0385485786|3.0|I love John Grisham and was very excited to read his newestbook.  Unlike his other books, this one didn't grab me from thebeginning.  I kept reading it thinking that it would get better.  It did, but only a little.  The ending was a bitter disappointment.  I will read his next book because I know it will have to be better than The Partner. This was not the John Grisham I know and love.
0679441018|2.0|I cannot give this book a lesser rating, because it was not a complete disaster.  It was definately very thought compelling, but it lacked the heart and soul of the previous Vampire books.  I read it straight through like the others, more out of loyalty and hope that it would get better.  I did enjoy the story, don't mistake me.  However, the characters were not as alive as in the previous books and the plot was all over the place. The wordiness reminded me of the Mayfair Chronicles; I was enthralled with the possibilties of the story, but at times did not think I could read another word.  In conclusion, this was not what I had anticipated it to be, and so am still feeling unfulfilled about the destinies of my vampire LeStat and my Louis, as well as the others.  For Vampire fans, you will be compelled to read this, but maybe you will enjoy it more if you lower your expectations

6300216268|5.0|Opening scene:  a slow, dramatic, no....I can't tell you.  Harold and Maude is one of the few movies where giving away the beginning (or in fact any part of it) can change your expectations.  You really have to have an open mind to watch Harold and Maude.  It's a cult classic; an esoteric film directed by Hal Ashby.  With themes ranging from the serious (suicide, the draft) to lighthearted (suicide, the draft), Harold and Maude run the gamut of emotional situations.  Just watch the movie, you'll see what I mean.  You have never seen a movie like this one, nor are you likely to ever again. END
1563523302|3.0|The authors take about 30,000 words to say the following: save your money, don't spend like an idiot on dumb ass consumer items, and invest like a maddog, and you, too, can have a whole bunch of money when you die.

0606050647|4.0|One of Hemingway's better novels, features Lady Brett Ashley and a young bullfighter. I found it a little hard to follow at some points, but an overall good book
0385311400|3.0|Swept away by her delightful first novel, Voyageur, I lost several weeks of my life devouring the second and third in Gabaldon's series. I lost  further time to Drums of Autumn, the latest (but   alas not greatest) installment.    Gabaldon is a highly gifted writer, able to  present a marvellously deep and textured world. Unfortunately, this book lacks the  depth and rich layering of the previous novels.    For this, I must indict Gabaldon's editors. What  is here is vintage &quot;Jamie and Claire&quot;, but the  narrative seems rushed, breathless; hardly more   than an outline.    The introduction of Brianna and Roger is perfect,  but their story is given short shrift, and one   longs for more detail, more exploration. Ditto  for brief vignettes depicting the plight of   native Americans, Jesuit priests, early American  society, and pirates, politics,and sociology of  the era.    Dear Diana, don't let them let you get away with  that again!
0679720200|5.0|Camus' captures the essence of existentialism through style and tone in this masterpiece of modern narration.  M. Meursault's summarized tale raises questions of motivation, existance, religon, etc.  This ambiguous narrator tests the context of a life so absurd that the novel will have you pondering for days! A halmark novel that deserves attention from any bibliophile

0688052304|5.0|The text begins simply.  Pirsig's casual style conveys each action and thought in real time, enabling the reader to forget that s/he is   reading a book.  When you get carried away in his discussion, you are as surprised as the narrator when his cycing partners catch up to him, breaking his concentration, reminding him that they have missed a turn.  This writing  style is amazing.  Later the discusions become more involved, requiring a much deeper  consideration by the reader.  I was able to  embrace Pirsig's direction much  better on the second read.  One of the best books I've ever read
0553284347|4.0|While half or us would like to deny that our parents have a big (and sometimes bad) influence over us, the other half would gladly blame their parents for their adult life problems. This book is kind of a midpoint between both positions. It talks about the painful legacies we get from our parents but also makes us responsible for our adult behavior. It isn't theorical or complicated, it's easy and full with stories that covers almost everything from verbal to sexual abuse. Some people don't like the title, but believe me it can't be worst, the title in Spanish is &quot;Padres que Odian&quot; (Parent's that hate). If you were raised by a human been and not a saint there is a big chance you can relate with this book, but remember to read it as a son or daughter not as a parent
1567184855|5.0|When the weight of day to day working/surviving in the corporate madhouse gets to much and I need a break, this book brings back a sense of perspective.  Thank you Michael - are there any more of your books out there?
0517702967|2.0|The premise of this book about cloning held such promise.  It just didn't deliver.  And, it was factually inaccurate as it concerned the internet.

0385470819|5.0|When I started reading John Grisham I really didn't understand the subjects that he used. Until I got older. When I first read A Time To Kill I fell in love with the story. I bought the book when the movie came out and I still read the book. This has to be John Grisham at his best. The story is so real and the charactors are so real. So to sum it up I love this book almost as much the movie. So thank John Grisham for the fantasic  book. I'll keep reading your books.

1573220167|5.0|High Fidelity hits where other &quot;relationship&quot; books miss entirely. The book is hilarious and serious at the same time, just like your last date. You can not read this novel without recognizing yourself, or someone you know, between the pages. While American readers may want to do a little research on some of the British slang, the tone is so easy-going and comfortable that you'll barely miss a thing.  High Fidelity follows a baby-boomer who acts like a generation X-er, while stumbling his way through girlfriends and his parents' expectations. It's sweet without sop, and sad without melodrama. And funny. I laughed out loud more times during this book than any episode of Friends could ever hope for (and I annoyed my girlfriend by reading half of it to her before she got her shot at it). A must read!
0446520950|4.0|This is a great read .. but you must pay attention to all the characters.  Mr. Baldacci does a great job of making them all come to life, but he does it at his speed, not necessarily the one that you are looking for! .. It's a great book .. and well worth any waiting you might have to endure! .. The end is gripping and makes you stop and think, long after you've put down the book

0517702967|1.0|I think it must have taken more work for Ken Follett to write The Third Twin than it would have taken him to write something good.  Nothing this bad can come naturally.  The characters are as shallow as an EPA-designated wetland.  The dialogue is contrived, and the suspense is nonexistent.  While the book is purportedly a novel, it is also a political polemic; all the &quot;good&quot; characters subscribe to the leftest of left-wing extremities, and all the &quot;bad&quot; ones are right-wing ideologues (at least in intention.)  I have a personal rule of not quitting a book once I've started it, and The Third Twin tested my resolve to the utmost
0679745203|5.0|Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient is easily  one of the finest novels that I have ever read.  As a PhD candidate in literature, I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to read and analyze  many fine works of literature.  I can honestly say   that this book ranks among the best.  He skillfully weaves the narrative with flashback, slowly, inexorably drawing us into the lives of Hannah, Carvaggio, Kip, and Hannah's dying patient.  With each little bit that one is given,  one only wants to learn more.  As the book ends, one is left with a sort of sadness that it has come to an end, but there is also a feeling of delicious enjoyment, like we have just enjoyed a sumptuous literary feast.
0385424736|5.0|John Grisham has out done himself once again. I didn't thinkthat I could love a book more then I did The Firm, but this isincredible. The level of action and the way that you become a part of the novel kept me up reading for 48 hours.

0345315227|1.0|This book is almost as bad as 3001.  The first 25 pages are interesting.  The rest is a waste of time, especially the non-climatic climax.  Clarke has written a self-serving money maker to trap  into adding to the value of his estate.  Give it up Arthur.  You're outdated.  If you want good Clarke, read &quot;Tales from the White Hart&quot; or &quot;Childhood's End.&quot

0385176228|5.0|This book is everything everyone else has said about it and more.  It has changed my life.  i know i've read it over 10 times, and every time i do there's something new to be found in it - but here's a caveat.  If you buy a nice hardcover copy, the two worlds are printed in two different colors of ink, red and green.  This is wonderful.  If you buy a paperback, the story (incredible) is the same, but instead of being bi-colored, you know you're in the real world because the print is italicized, and when you enter Fantastica, the print is regular.  Bleah.  Have a paperback to keep in your backpack for long bus rides, but get yourself a hardcover copy too.  Because i said so.  You'll never regret it

Yes, McCourt writes relatively well and his descriptions of his childhood experiences help the reader to vicariously experience 1/10 of his childhood sorrows. But Please,why oh why, did he have to drone on for almost 400 pages about snotty noses,his drunken father's alcoholic debauchery,yellow crude in his eyes, eating pigs heads.........A synopsis of his book should state, &quot;today was miserable, tomorrow was miserable, and hey,guess what ?, the next day was miserable too!&quot
0451160916|5.0|This was a very chilling book, and seemed, in a way, a sort of an ancestor to King's book &quot;IT&quot; (he even uses the term 'It' in the end), only &quot;The Shining&quot; is better (a lot better, actually).  One thing I can't understand is why Stanley Kubrick's film is considered such a poor adaptation of the book (not least by King himself).  True it wasn't great (Shelley Duvall was all wrong for one thing), but it did have its moments.  I guess the problem was that its not hard to imagine Jack Nicholson going off the deep end while the point of the book was to show how a alcoholic man with a temper, otherwise normal, could have his worst traits used against him and his family

0345403959|5.0|A couple years ago I picked up THE BELGARIAD books....and read them all within a month. Ditto THE MALLOREON. I became an Eddings fan overnight. BELGARATH THE SORCERER is a delightful companion to the two series, and should be read after enjoying the ten other books. The switch to first-person narrative works splendidly (I hope the Eddingses continue that format with Polgara's history) and the humor, always a treat in an Eddings book, is even sharper here. The Old Wolf's fiendishness is here in technicolor as he explains a lot of the pre-history for which there was no room in the two earlier series....What exactly were the Accords of Vo Mimbre? Why isn't there a country called Aloria? Where did the Darine and Mrin codexes come from? It's all there, with a minimum amount of tedium. It's like spending an evening with the Ancient One over a tankard of ale while he tells tales as only he can. Bravo

0312954468|5.0|It was wonderful to find a Wilbur Smith book that lives up to the standard set by two of his previous books - 'When the Lion Feeds' and 'The Sunbird'.  While I have enjoyed other Wilbur Smith books this was the first in years to hold my attention from start to finish.  The story was gripping and beautifully told - I felt at times that I was the narrator, the slave Taita.  I found myself resenting the time I had to spend away from the book and couldn't wait to pick it up again each time I put it down.  My only complaint is that it did finish - I wish it could have gone on for another 300 pages
1563523302|5.0|I was interested in this book when I read the quotes in the Wall Street Journal.  I am a CPA that assists clients with long-term planning.  Many of the comments are in line with my thinking, but I'm always looking for another way to express the theories. I am so impressed with the the writing style.  It was easy to understand and a quick and entertaining read.  I've purchased extra copies to give to clients.  This book is a great way to introduce basics without overwhelming or turning off people.  It would make a great graduation gift, for high school, or college.

0694516929|2.0|The audio cassette is ho-hum at best, so I guess I should not really complain that it is so short ... &lt; 1 hr.  Scott Adams' speaking style is uninteresting and unstimulating. I had hoped for some of his cartoon humor and style to get through.  Not a chance!  The first half (side) seemed more of an attempt to justify this forey into book writing &amp; only the second half (side) got down to the subject matter.  While I agree with some of Adam's criticisms of modern-day save-your-business rituals, he seemed to discount each really insightful and on-target point with silly attempts at humor that weren't funny enough to be effective.    The tape is definitely NOT RECOMMENDED.  The book???  I'll wait and borrow the hard copy from a fellow lemming.
0896594289|5.0|We owe this 20-year old piece of high fantasy to a Roman architect, Luigi Serafini. This is a large book of splendid, eerie illustrations of an impossible world in a parallel universe, with copious comments in an incomprehensible language in an imaginary script. A world at once familiar, inhabited as it is by humans, and hauntingly different, with its very own laws of physics, its strange fauna, its stranger flora, its unimaginable society, technology, even mathematics. The Codex Seraphinianus is to that world what Diderot's Encyclopaedia is to ours, only lavishly and artistically illustrated. A feast for the eyes, a tease for the brain, to which you will find yourselves drawn again and again, and again, in ever renewed fascination. It is a particular joy in the Italian edition (published by Franco Maria Ricci of Milan) if you can afford the outrageous price -- some US$250: hand-made paper, a hard-cover bound in black silk in a box clad in black silk, such luxuries do not come cheaply
0399128964|5.0|If you haven't read this science fiction classic you should catch up right away. The rest of the Dune series never quite lived up to this seminal masterpiece, a peerless visionary novel that is as readable and masterly as any piece of literature in any category.  It is the story of a young man born to be the spiritual and military leader of a mystical band of desert nomads who survive in the wastelands of the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. The battle occurs in the very distant future against the backdrop of complicated Universal politics and intrigue. The book has a bitter taste as we watch what truly befalls a real messiah (as you know, a prophet is never loved in his own land), but it is cut with sweetness that includes romance and mysticism
0679735909|5.0|A.S. Byatt's novel is a superbly intelligent and  absorbing story of the power of possession. Byatt's intense literary power is elegantly displayed in &quot;Possession&quot; as this is a story which engages both the intellectual and romantic side of her readers. This novel, although slightly heavy at times, is accessable to a wide range of readers and quickly draws the reader into the lives of the characters. Once inside the pages of &quot;Possession,&quot; this novel carries you on a wonderful journey as two people retrace the history of two lovers as they slowly come to discover their own. &quot;Possession&quot; will leave your mind entranced and heart warmed.

0399103422|5.0|The Godfather is one of my all time favorite novels!  It is a story about sacrifice and family loyalty.  A story about a true &quot;prodigal son&quot; and the woman who loves him.  The book is much better then the movie!  It show the intense love of a son who wanted nothing to do with the family business but then ends up saving it and himself.  It tells about the strength of these organizations.  It also has a wonderful ending.  Puzo's Last Don is also wonderful.  And the Sicilian is about Michael (the lead in the Godfather) however I found it boring and much lacking

0679731725|5.0|I'm glad that I took a review at the back of the book &quot;If you have only one book to read this year, make it this one.&quot; seriously. This wonderfully written book has to be savoured slowly. Please do not rush through it as it should never be treated as a bestseller. The poetic prose makes it a hauntingly beautiful read. Not to be missed. Try Ishiguro's other books such as A Pale View of Hills and An Artist of the Floating World. You will not be disappointed

0345315227|1.0|Arthur has flogged this pony longer than Frank Herbert beat up the Dune worm. Unrealistic, unconnected, a needless assault on religion, a repeition of the space elevator, and a vision, I hope, that ignores human capacity to grow.  A great charitable donation after a mistaken purchase, but a pitiful legacy from the author of Childhood's End.
0385470819|5.0|I did not read A Time to Kill until after I had read The Firm and The Pelican Brief.  It seems to me that he took more time with this first book, and it is still better than any of his subsequent novels.  The story is more gripping, and the characters have more depth.  It even comes close to being as good as To Kill a Mockingbird

0316921173|2.0|<br /> Sigh. And I was so looking forward to a good read... <br />  I forced myself to read the first 255 pages (and every blessed footnote along the way) of this Generation-X encyclopedia of drugs, alcohol, and adolescent tennis before I decided to stop torturing myself and throw the book away. Oh, the guilt! Since books are my passion, throwing one in the trash was, well, difficult.  <br />  So what's wrong with it? Have you ever seen one of those pictures that at first glance looks like nothing more than millions of colored dots? If you relax your eyes and look &quot;through&quot; the dots, a 3-D picture begins to take shape, and pretty soon you don't see the dots at all because you're inside the picture. That's as close as I can get to the magic of reading a good book. Sadly, with Infinite Jest, I couldn't find the story inside the words. I was always uncomfortably aware of the &quot;dots&quot; - of Wallace's sentence structure, his choice of words, his background research, and, most of all, the prodigious amount of EFFORT that went into this book.  <br />  Infinite Jest contains a thousand pages of disjointed character sketches with nothing but the book binding to hold them together. Too bad the sum of the parts doesn't add up to anything more than a technical (w)hole.
039428013X|5.0|I read this book without being biased by hearing about or seeing its epynymous movie, and I  thought it was one of the three best books  I've ever read (the other two are The Grapes  of Wrath and Huckleberry Finn).  It may seem  strange to write a book about World War II   now after so many others have been written, but  after all, that event shaped our current society like no other.  And, as I see it, the  second world war resulted in the usurpation of  Great Britain as the dominant world power.  Even  so, everyone still recognizes the British accent  as commanding, although the face may be   disfigured.  That theme, coupled with the nurse's  connection by gender to the nuns - who left the  monastery providentially stocked - is deftly   played upon by the nurse's alternating sensual  attractions to the helpless/dominant English  patient and to the assertive/effeminate bomb  defuser.  I recommend this book to anybody  with a sense of recent history, good literature,  and the intricacies of attraction and love.
0783811950|5.0|The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho offers every reader, young and old, somthing to think about.  The story of a young sheperd in search of a hidden treasure instead finds meaning to his existence and life's daily activities.

0553577123|5.0|I think that one of the reasons I enyoed her diary so much is because you could understand what it was like being in hiding.  What makes it human is that she writes it with things not only about the war but about her personal life.  I think I understood it better because my grandfather is a German- Jewish who survied the war during his childhood in Germany.  It makes you understand how horible things can happen and you can not do anything about them.  It also helps you understand the Houlocaust better.  Well, at least it m,ade me understand the Houlocaust better
0684874350|5.0|If the extreme poverty endured by Frank McCourt was responsible for producing such a gifted writer, then perhaps a few current best-selling authors should have grown up in Limerick, Ireland, wearing tires for shoe soles and being forced to vacate the bottom floor of their apartment during the winter due to the flooded conditions therein.<br /><br />The most striking thing about &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;, besides the lyrical prose, is the pervasive tones of forgiveness and love.  Nowhere are these more evident than in the passages describing little Frankie McCourt having to hunt through all the pubs on his street to find his father, who is somewhere drinking away 5 pounds sent to the family in honor of a new baby.  The reader is impressed by the lack of bitterness in the grown Frank McCourt; he simply tells what happened with warmth and humor and compassion.<br /><br /> Whether the reader is laughing at the author's frank, hilarious descriptions of his own sexual awakening, or shaking his or her head over the passages describing the deaths of his two brothers and only sister, they will, as they close the book, wonder immediately when the sequel will be available.
0345350499|5.0|I have read this book twice now, slowly, so I could savor both the stories and the way they are written.  I refer to this book frequestly in my English Literature classes, and several students have also read it.  They also give it exellent reviews.

0385470819|5.0|How does Grisham do it everytime! Right when you think everything is okay, something big happens! Like his house burning down, or when the Ku Klux Klan took the law clerk. She was one of the main characters, who would have thought she was going to get hurt?

It therefore teaches the reader what he may not know about worldwide culture through and enigmatic and well written story.

0385421982|5.0|If you thought A Time To Kill was Grisham's best, you are in for a wonderful surprise! 3 weeks before, Darby was having a wonderful love affair with her law professor, Callahan. Yet when two justices are killed without a trace of evidence, she decides to uncover the killer. Then, when Callahan hands her brief over to a pal in the FBI, he dies two days later in Darby's place. She's one step ahead of the killers, and doesn't stay in one place for two nights. Where does Grisham get these fabulous ideas?! All I can say is WOW!!
0446520950|3.0|The story starts out interestingly enough, but the believability of the characters is weak as the story continues.  There are some interesting bits related to the Internet, but the fact that an email through AOL is at the center of the plot is weak.  No one ever got a busy signal and we all know that just doesn't happen.  Finally, I figured out the mystery by page 424.  After that it was all down hill.  I got the feeling that Baldacci had a movie in mind when he wrote the &quot;thrilling&quot; ending.  I wish he would spare us.  I get enough of that at my local theatre
0679452729|2.0|A disappointment considering the author.  The characters came off as flat, boring and (worst of all) stupid.  Liberal bias and author commentary run rampant throughout this book and the bad guys (white males) are evil without reason.  Only two things redeem this book:  an interesting look at the nature vs. nurture debate and some very good chapters where an innocent man is abused by the police and inmates.  The rest of the book was painful
0671559850|5.0|&quot;The man is an independent trader, of sorts. Not a very successful one.... He has a small, battered ship with a long, ridiculous name... There is no crew to worry about, only the man himself. And he -- well,  he's a little ridiculous, too. He'll give us no trouble... He keeps  cats, I hear... If he so much as threatens to report us, the hireling  and I can dispose of him and feed him to his cats&quot;.    Thus does Kaj Nevis, adventurer ordinary in a distant future, describe  Haviland Tuf to his motley gang, whereby you have guessed that they are  up to no good. But Haviland Tuf, skipper, owner, crew and sole  shareholder of the &quot;Cornucopia of Excellent Goods at Low Prices&quot;,  nevertheless ends up the master of the prize coveted by Kaj Nevis: the  last ship of the long-forgotten Genetic Corps for late Galactic Empire,  a 30-mile long leviathan, with working weaponry and tens of thousands of  operational cloning vats ready to spew biological death in any form from  deadly alien bacteria to a herd of Terran Tyrannosaurus Rex. How Tuf,  the gentle giant with a fondness for cats, onion pies and ale, and with  a paunch to match, now self-taught genetic engineer, has the gigantic  ship repaired and roams the galaxy to set aright half a dozen mand-made  impending ecological disasters, that is the rest of the tale. Barely  ever lifting a finger, and never his voice, soft-spoken long-suffering  Tuf, with a kitten or two peering out of his ample  pockets, teaches a stinging lesson to the bloodthirsty arena masters of  Norn, unmasks the false messiah of Charity, and brings peace between the  sea-dwelling aborigines of Namor and the human settlers who had mistaken  them for tasty tidbits. But it takes him two attempts to solve the  runaway population explosion of S'uthlam which threatens the peace with  its neighbours (Lebensraum! Lebensraum!).    The characters come to life, splendidly. No two are alike, each is  strongly typed, even the most minor. No two have the same mannerisms,  the same speech, the same personality. Yet they are never caricatures.  They are all dreadfully ordinary in their unusual ways, from Kaj Nevis  the psychopathic wannabe master-of-the-universe to Celine Waan, the  lawsuit-happy loud-mouthed gross blockhead academic, we've all met their  kinds. The worlds visited by Tuf are equally imaginative, credible, and  diverse. It all adds up to just under 400 pages of sheer delight. The  hardback is out of print, but Victor Gollancz of London did bring out a  paperback in 1988 (ISBN 0-575-04266-4).  Failing that, hunt around for  old issues of Analog: January, February, October, November, mid-December  1985, October 1981, and February 1978, where most of Tuf's voyages were  published.

0451169514|5.0|Stephen King is known as the master of horror, but one must never be blinded by the media's cries of &quot;scarry!&quot;.   I prefer to think of King as a master storyteller, and leave it at that.  Here King has woven one of his most intricate tales, a tale of good versus evil as much as a tale of the transition from child to adult.  For those unfamiliar with the plot, It deals with a group of seven children, misunderstood and shunned by all other peers, who find each other, and are joined by a common factor: every one of them has had a run in with It, which is the name they have given to the embodiment of evil that resides in the sewers and the dark places of their home town of Derry, Maine.  The book deals not only with their battles with It, but also with their battles with their peers, their families, and themselves.  The book follows the group through a two month interval in 1958, and follows them through to their reunion, circa 1985, when a forgotten promise draws them together again for a final battle with It.  I had read this book at least ten times by the time I was eleven years of age,  and have read it many times since. I had the fortune to be able to expierence this book from a child's view, and then from an adults, much like the characters in the book.  I feel that anyone who is not intimidated by the huge size of this book would enjoy it immensely.  And to those who are intimidated- give this book a try anyway.  I feel that it could be one of the finest things you have ever read
0679745653|5.0|Readers tend to be sadists.  How else do you explain their desire to place themselves into the lives of, or to become, fictional strangers, even when the outcome results in having your heart ripped out?  The answer has something to do with &quot;want&quot;; readers want what characters want.  Or readers want characters.  Especially in this case, in which the object of desire is a tease yet a prude; glossy yet tainted; experienced yet naive. Holly Golightly is as complex a character as ever written, but a hell of a lot more desirable, and I want Holly Golightly.<br />  Capote has penned the quintessential &quot;bitch,&quot; which can only be defined as someone with the unique ability to pull someone in emotionally while pushing them away physically.  And while Holly is a &quot;bitch&quot; of a character, Capote is a &quot;bitch&quot; of a writer, and &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; is a &quot;bitch&quot; of a book.  At the novel's onset, I met Holly, instantly fell in love with her, and from there I spent my time chasing her, and I chased her until the conclusion, the point when I realized that my pursuit was futile.  (This quest lasted for approximately two hours.)  So what did I do then? I picked up the book and started reading it again.<br />  &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's&quot; is for gluttons for literary punishment--and I mean this in the most satisfying way--which should be anyone who enjoys reading.  This is an almost perfect book that satisfies while leaving the reader longing for more.
0671673009|1.0|By now, this book has probably outsold the Bible.  On the bestseller list for a gazillion weeks, template for a thousand imitators (and not a few sequels), guiding light for millions of spiritual seekers, &quot;The Road Less Traveled&quot; may be one of the most quietly influential books of the last quarter-century.  Which is a great pity, because it's a bad book.<br /><br />The flaw lies not in its overtly Christian message, nor in its rather Puritan insistence on discipline and labor.  Such beliefs are not to be mocked.  No - I object to this book because I think it is simply meanspirited, a sadly cocksure display of guru-ship that is not different in kind from EST or Scientology.  It gains an audience by convincing the reader of some terrible, insurmountable character flaw, but holds out only a few vague platitudes as solutions.  It's classic bait-and-switch, successful only because it causes the very self-doubt its rhetoric seeks to relieve.  Friends who've read the book say what a great comfort it is - but are unhappier after reading it.  Thus, hoplessly, they read it again, and again, and commend it to their friends...and no one gains by it.  Rather like some addicting drug, or a beautiful promise that always remains unfulfilled.
0380705273|5.0|My sister spoke very early and her first words were &quot;I'm telling mommy!&quot;  From the moment she arrived home from the hospital, we were locked in mortal combat.  Our rivalry finally ended when I left home at 18.  We are now good friends, but I wish that my parents had read this book during our childhood.   Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish, authors of &quot;How to Talk so Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot;, share years of experience gained through their own parenting trials and through those of the thousands of parents who have attended their workshops.  Their aim is to teach parents the skills and techniques necessary to redirect rivalry into cooperation.  Topics such as teaching parents to stop treating their children equally instead of uniquely, helping children express their angry feelings acceptably, motivating children to solve their own problems, and handling fighting are expertly covered.  This best-selling book puts the reader right into the middle of a fictional workshop, sitting with other frustrated parents, asking questions and working out solutions.  Each chapter begins with questions aimed at helping parents to understand and acknowledge the feelings behind a common problem.  The book then describes the communication skills necessary to defuse the rivalry and gain cooperation instead of arguments.  Theory is  put into practice in cartoon form.  A problem is presented in a cartoon, which shows the &quot;typical&quot; way an untrained parent would respond, and then the way the problem could be resolved using the new techniques the authors teach.  The last chapter of the book explores ways in which we can mend fences and renew our relationships with our own adult siblings.  Several poignant stories illustrate that it is never too late to learn effective communication skills. I found this book useful for parents of only children, since the skills presented are as useful for dealing with one child as for many.  For  parents of two ormore children, this is a MUST READ
015670160X|5.0|&quot;Good To Eat&quot;  (Woolf 144 ) The Evolution of Meaning as Examined in Orlando  <BR> &quot;Time has passed over me... Nothing is any longer one thing! I take up a handbag and I think of  an old bumboat woman frozen in the ice&quot; (305). <BR> <br />Orlando examines how experience creates meaning. It is a discussion of intertextuality where metaphors are created diachronically. Meaning is created, however imperfectly, by the piling up of associations with a particular image. The book illustrates both the creation of imperfect meaning, but also the undeniably human desire to communicate those ideas.  <br />By repeating images, Orlando supposes, we give them meaning. The oak tree, for example, evolves meaning through time. At the beginning it's just an image: a boy alone on a hilltop contemplating the way that the roots feel. Then Orlando removes it from reality by making it into a poem. He adds things in the margin, reworking, elevating the image until it is not a boy under a tree at all. He takes the real and  compounds it until it becomes abstract. When Orlando finally lays down under the tree at the end, having &quot;given birth&quot; to the manuscript, the action  has a completely new meaning. It is attached forever to Turkey and gypsies and the whole life that preceded it. It transcends image and object to become allegorical. When Woolf describes it she is not merely describing an image, she is attempting to communicate a life.   <br />By layering the image in the text, adding meaning on top of meaning, the number of interpretations grows exponentially. The novel would submit that this is the way of language and life. Like metaphors, people are not just as they are at the moment but are also everything and everyone that has preceded. They are the past: the trees that they have sat under and the words that they have spoken. The whole of a person can never be communicated, only approximated in images and metaphors. And yet it's &quot;a curious fact that though human's... have such imperfect means of communication, that they can only say `good to eat' when they mean `beautiful'... they endure ridicule and misunderstanding [rather] than keep any experience to themselves&quot; (144).  ORLANDO is, definitively, Good to Eat
0440180295|5.0|Never have I read a book that has played upon my conflicting emotions in such a way as this.  Do you laugh at Vonnegut's trademark humor--here in top form--or do you cry at the emotionless yet moving retelling of the horrors of war, culminating in the firebombing of Dresden in particular?  Neither.  This can elicit no singular emotional response, unless sheer awe is an emotion.  Utterly fascinatingly horribly great

Philosophically speaking of course!  Gaardner creates a world so complex that it even involves the reader.. that's my favorite part!   But you'll have to read it to find out how.   <br />   It does get a bit slow in parts, but its a great read... definitly worth the time...
0345315227|3.0|The book was interesting as it started out then started to drag.  When Frank Poole was going to meet up with Dave Bowman, I thought that this would be the highlight of the book.  Instead Mr. Clarke only summarized what happened between the two characters.  I also thought the disapperence of the monolith was confusing.  I'm not sure what really happened.  I also thought that disabling the monolith with an old computer virus was really streaching it.  Also I thought HAL was destroyed in 2010.  Mr. Clarke didn't explain how he was resurected and merged with Dave to become Halman. A very disappointing book.
0870119435|5.0|As one who lived in Japan for ten years, I can't remember how I came across this book, nor can I pinpoint exactly what makes this book so outstanding.  Perhaps &quot;haunting&quot; would be a fitting adjective.  Once finished, the reader is left with a feeling of melancholy, and caught up in the main character of the story.  As always, Mr. Murakami's characters are extremely believable, fascinating, and reaffirms the fact that regardless of nation or culture, people are basically the same, the world over, and all wrestle with the same set of existential dilemmas

The FBI wanted him forembezzlement, the State for murder, two insurance companies for fraud,his former law partners for money and revenge, and his former wife and her boyfriend for killing.<br /> So who are the Bad Guys?

Patrick's law partners for creative bookkeeping efforts to make 90 million dollars disappear?  All of the above?<br /> John Grisham has a carefully crafted intricate plot in The Partner, one of his most controversial novels yet.  There is less legal technical detail here than we find in many of his books; this makes for a fast read and entertaining chase scenes.  Grisham wraps up The Partner with a somewhat unsatisfying denoument, as unsatisfying as, say,the ending of Rainmaker.<br /> On the Grisham scale, Partner ranks far above The Chamber, but perhaps a bit below Runaway Jury and The client.

Even if you don't like war stories (which I don't) it is still well worth the read
0679745203|3.0|Sorry to give it all away. I saw the movie and laughed at all the wrong parts... well I thought they funny. I had to read the book to clear up a big dispute I had with my girlfriend. &quot;I don't get it - if they were flying down to pick him up in the desert why did the wife come too... The plane only has two seats so where was he supposed to sit on the trip home ???&quot;. Alas I was none the wiser after reading the book
0812550706|5.0|Simply one of the Very best Sci-Fi books ever written. I have re-read this book about five times and each time I discover new and exciting things.  I am now on my fifth copy because friends borrow  and never seem to return it!  Which is fine by me because I want the whole world to discover what a joy this book truly is
0385485786|2.0|This book is an empty, substance-less story more that would fitbetter on an NBC Movie of the Week than in a book.  It takes too longto read a plot that goes nowhere fast!  When Grisham does move the plot he does it interestingly, but he does it so slowly that it becomes predictable, dull, and downright boring.  The only intelligence sets in during the last chapter when Grisham seems to wax philosophically.  Other than that - wait for the movie that I'm sure will be coming soon!
0316920045|4.0|I have rarely felt so conflicted about a book.  On the one hand, this book is, as much as I hate to say it, brilliant.  It's funny, it's a deft satire, and it gave me a lot to chew on.  I stuck with it for a thousand pages, though, because I was interested in and cared about the characters.  And here's the problem.  The post-modern cuteness of it all is sort of admirable on an intellectual level, but the non-ending is profoundly unsatisfying because the book also works on an emotional level. I cared about the characters, and I wanted to know what happened to them. While I admire what Wallace is doing, and while I get the fact that he is wink-winking at us about it,( James Incandeza's films are &quot;anti-confluential&quot;, so I guess I should have known the book wasn't going to &quot;flow together&quot;) I still felt cheated.     Does this make me some sort of philistine?  Maybe, but I think that there is skill involved in pulling all the threads of a novel together, and I think Wallace is able to do it but decides not to in order to advance his themes. I feel like there is an implicit contract involved in a book like this--stay with me for a thousand pages, and I'll make it worth your while.  While Infinite Jest is certainly an entertaining ride, its &quot;anti-confluential&quot; ending violates that contract.  I'm annoyed.
0440111498|5.0|Heller's Closing time places a character in  1944 Dresden alongside Vonnegut as a young POW. Considering the (self reported) impact the bombing of Dresden had on Vonnegut's life and work, this could be construed as a crack in the wall hiding the greatest literary conspiracy since they misplaced the last page of The Fifteen Comendments. Admitedly, these could be ravings explained by the vertigo I'm suffering having over-dosed on morbid satire. I reread Cat's Cradle for the nth time this week. This is my current comment: Much like being punched in the gut by a heavyweight, you're left breathless and staggering even if you'd seen it coming.
0385121679|5.0|King grinds out plenty of dreck, however, The Shining is a great novel for learning the mechanics of narrative.  The plot moves like a frieght train and you WILL NOT put it down.  A perfect example of how to write a true pager-turner.    Confidential to all creative writing professors: The Shining should be part of every creative writing class
0671721720|5.0|The second in the Honor Harrington series, I expected to be let down after the excellent &quot;On Basilisk Station&quot; opener.  The Cold War between Haven and Manticore heats up, with Honor in the middle.  What starts as a convoy escort for the captain turns into a flashpoint in the Cold War with 2 technologically backwards planets as pawns.  The plot is entrancing, with the reader always left wondering what will happen next.  I highly recommend this book and the series
006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud has entertained readers with his wonderful comic, _Zot!_  Now he informs his readers in this, one of the greatest books on the psychology of comics ever written.    Shunning the usual nostalgic tone of most books written about comics, McCloud uses the comic format to discuss not the history of the X-Men, but rather the method of storytelling in which such characters are presented.  He writes on a vast list of subjects, ranging from the meaning of the word &quot;Comics&quot; to the use of blank space between panels.  The art style is simple where it needs to be and complex where it is required.  The message comes across in panel after panel of information that is stated simply enough for everybody to understand, if they will only open their minds to these &quot;Funny Books.&quot;    Scott McCloud's book is an invaluable resource.  It allows you to stop merely reading comics, and start understanding them.
0395860210|5.0|Philip Roth's American Pastoral is an exilarating tour-de-forceby a great novelist at the height of his powers. The life of Seymour&quot;Swede&quot; Levov as seen by seen by Nathan Zuckerman, Roth's ofter alter-ego, is surely one of the greatest tragedies in modern literature. &quot;Swede&quot; is a throroghly good man who strives constantly for the happiness of his loved ones. His qualities as a character heighten the tragedy as he experiences trials of biblical proportions. <br /> This book touches on many themes and points in post-war American history with such detail ,eloquence and sympathy that it should be considered a masterpiece.
0385486804|5.0|Jon Krakauer is a sensitive and intelligent writer. His research is excellent. It is obvious that his demeanor is such that people speak to him openly. His book is a wonderful exposition of the life and final times of this complex young man. However, Krakauer lacks the knowledge and experience to fully assess the motivations and actions of Chris McCandless. He projects too much of his own youthful lust for adventure into the character of Chris and fails to see the essential element of McCandless which is a young man who simply doesn't fit inside of his skin and is seeking a way out of it.  McCandless anger against his parents is a projection of his discontent with himself. He invents a new persona in each new location and maintains friendships for periods just brief enough to keep the illusion from paling.  In spite of his failure to correctly analyze Chris's motivations Krakauer writes an excellent description of McCandless. He doesn't include solely the things that reinforce his personal analysis. It is a fine book, probably worth reading several times to truly see and understand the disaffection so prevalent in Chris McCandless' generation
0451167716|5.0|I can't imagine how anyone could watch the movie and understand all of the nuances unless they've read the book. The whole Johnny Fontain part seems much more important in the book then in the movie, as an example
0812550706|5.0|Books are much like television or movies.  It takes watching 10 to find 1 that's any good.  This is one of the &quot;1's&quot;. The number of reviews on this book is a fitting testament to this work.  While I have just finished reading it for the first time, there's no doubt I'll be reading it again.  My only regret is that I didn't read the book many years earlier.  If you're a fan of science fiction, don't make the same mistake.  Read it now
0156482339|5.0|Sapir's 1921 &quot;Language&quot; is one of the finest of many fine works by the distinguished linguist, anthropologist and humanist. With piercing yet accessible insight, he guides the reader through  fundamental questions about language: How are culture and language related? How does language work? How do languages vary?   Although there are many general introductions to the subject (Bloomfield's and Jesperson's volume come to mind), Sapir's is unmatched for sheer readability in interest. Highly recommended.
0812550706|5.0|OK, first I have to explain the 9.  I'm from the midwest, no one and nothing is a ten.  Let's say it's a 9+.<br />  It's been five or more years since I read this great book.  After reading it, I immediately went out in search of (and read) its sequels &quot;Speaker For the Dead&quot; and &quot;Xenocide&quot;.  That in itself is a tribute to my appreciation of this book.<br />  Andrew Wiggin (aka Ender) is (like me) a player of games.  He plays games so well, that he becomes the Earth's greatest military genius.  But is this a good thing?<br />   Ender's brother and sister are similar to him, but not militarily oriented.  They become Earth's greatest POLITICAL genius.  (The singular noun here is intentional.  Read the book.)<br />   The book focuses on Ender and his exploits in learning to save the human race from extinction at the hands of the alien race known as the buggers, but a critical subplot is what his brother and sister accomplish here on Earth using what the Internet has matured into.  Mind you, this book was written before the Internet became a household word.<br />   Ender has been engineered (more or less) to destroy the buggers, but he is still a human, and he must learn to live with what he is.  He sees his brother as evil, but the evil in his brother is the good in him.<br />   This book is filled with similar contradictions.  In essence, the author paints a picture of humanity and forces the reader to decide whether this is good, or bad.  Then, as if that's not enough, he gives the reader a mirror image of that picture, and requires another decision; good or bad?<br />   You decide.<br />   But before you make your final decision, you might want to read the sequels...Speaker for the Dead, and Xenocide.<br />   Enjoy.
0679720200|5.0|A terrific read.  Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace.  I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage.  M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of &quot;getting by.&quot;  Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life.  &quot;Effect&quot; instead of &quot;Cause.&quot;  The story begins with a death, and ends with a death.  In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's &quot;fiancee&quot; or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes.  Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon.  Be &quot;Cause.&quot;  Not &quot;Effect.&quot;  Get out and LIVE.  Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply &quot;getting by.&quot
0195067142|5.0|The book is forceful and compelling.  It was hard to put down once started.  Very thought envoking and allows your imagination to actually bring the scenes to dreadful life.  However hard to believe there were no cussing Marines!  Considering I only know a couple who don't during peacetime.<br /><br />Not sure I would agree with the opinion of one reviewer that the author must still be living the war due to the graphic nature of the telling.  I believe this is more of a reflection on the quality of the Marine training of the time.  Clear and concise was the emphasis and the book clearly reflects as such.
0385121679|5.0|You are alone in a big dark house. All you can hear is the wind outside. There's not a single living person in fifty miles. You are trapped there...alone in the dark...  You go to the library and choose a book to read. By some weird reason you take King's Shining. That was not a smart move in these conditions.     The next hours find you sitting in a comfortable chair...you just can't put the book down. You are so scared that you would like to SCREAM but you'll still keep on reading.     When you eventually close the book you have definately finished it. There is no way you can put it down before that. But you'll keep on sitting in this chair, too scared to move, too much overwhelmed by this book.    You will never forget this night. Every time you are alone you will think about it....
0679745203|5.0|As a high school student reading this book for an assignment, I was not expecting to be entertained by any means.  However, I enjoyed this fantastic novel.  The complex web of mystery surrounding the charcters was gripping. Reading the sensuous discriptive passages was more like reading a wonderful poem instead of reading a novel. This splendid novel is definitely worth the read
0553473328|5.0|My co-workers and I have looked forward with anticipation to the arrival of this book.  We have shared and reviewed each book in the saga.  Our only complaint is that once it is over we know we will have to wait another year for the next edition.  Finishing the book was like saying goodbye to old friends.  Drums of Autumn held me spellbound as Claire and Jamie try to make their way in the American wilderness.  We cheered Brianna's decision to join her mother and father, and were thrilled when Roger finally followed.  We cried for Ian and the family.  Brianna's arrival at Lallybroch was like coming home again.  We are all dying to read the next book.  Our lives will be so dull in comparison
0449911357|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes is a must read for anyone  who has ever dreamed of a better life.  This book is a heart gripping tale of four women, two from the present and two from the past.  Flagg does a wonderful job of interweaving their lives together so that the four lives meet in a time and place that is special to all.  This was a hard book to put down because I lived the lives of Idgy, Ruth, Mrs. Threadgood and Mrs. Couch and I wanted to see where the next adventure would take me
0345315227|2.0|I'm sorry, but I was very disappointed with this effort. It was interesting to resurrect Frank Pool and explore his point of view...but it just didn't develop. While Mr. Clarke did plagerize himself somewhat, he seemed to have missed the path(s) he took in the previous books. What happened to Heywood Floyd?? I had such hopes after 2061, that we'd get to learn what was really going on. I can't believe in the future as foretold in 3001. Humans are far to self-important and conceited to not go after the bad guys...  Stop reading now, if you're going to read the book.    The ending is every bit as plausible as the Independence Day movie. You know, where the computer geek can log his PowerMac onto the Alien's computer and then upload a virus that crashes their system. Yeah. Right.    I'm sorry Mr. Clarke, it just doesn't work this time.  Thank you!
0884271536|5.0|If you only buy one book this year, this is it! Take the Theory of Constraints [TOC] and apply it to Project Management and you have Critical Chain. Set in a university with numerous business connections and you have the perfect environment for his latest business novel about TOC.  As good [if not better] than The Goal. It stands alone; one does not need to read The Goal or It's Not Luck to apprecaite this exciting new release.
0002730162|4.0|I have never been very interested in pirates or plunder or the skull and crossbones flag until I read this book.  Captain Long John Silver has been   quite a fictional figure not only for my self but for the world (ex. Long John Silver's restaraunts).  I must admit that I liked the book, but there was a flaw in it that I found.  Jim Hawkins made the plotline a little too obvious at times.  In one spot expecially, might I point out, he says that the apple barrel would in time save them all.  Now that's a little obvious, don't you think?  Perhaps if the author had found a way to avoid these give-aways I would have been more surprised with the story line than was when I read it for the first time.  In the end, it's an exceptional piece of work, but the author did make some unforgivable mistakes at making the plot too obvious too soon.  Oh well.  I do have one more thing to say, though.  Fifteen men on the dead mans chest!  Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum!  Drink and the devil had done for the rest!  Yo, ho, ho, and another victory in the adventure field
0930289455|5.0|This book finally attempts to give a history to one of comicdom's most famous, yet most engimatic, villians.  The two parallel plots in the book of the Joker attempting to drive Commisioner Gordon insane in a manner similar to how he had, as displayed in the parallel plot.  This book manages  to convey a true humanity to this character as a man who had a real life and family and how it  utter collapses around him.  This culminates in the desperate crime that lead to his chemical scarring that marked his descent into madness.  You will be left with a very different impression of the Joker as you finish one of the finest superhero stories ever written.
0393039765|4.0|Palahniuk's novel was a bit lost in the scramble of promoting and reviewing current &quot;literary&quot; fiction.  Norton issued it as a mainstream novel, but may have made a mistake by not promoting the book's affinity with postmodern apocalyptic fiction by J. G. Ballard, who obviously influenced this author's work.  He isn't an easy read; Palahniuk pushes his obsessions about as far as Poe did in his most outre work (e.g., &quot;Berenice&quot;), but is never less than riveting.  I read much of the book in public in airports on a flight home at Christmas, and if I had started reading aloud I might have been arrested on the spot.  Palahniuk gets down to the grungiest, most painfully disturbing level of life in his portrait of contemporary underground men (literally so, since the &quot;fight clubs&quot; are staged in basements).  There's a trick ending in this book--but without it the book might have gone downhill, since the earlier parts are so over the top.  Anyone taken by promising American writers like Rick Moody and Donald Antrim ought to look at this book.  I recommend it, and predict a cult following for it
0345403959|4.0|<br /> As one who awaited the ending books of both the Belgariad and the Malloreon for what seemed an eternity, I also awaited BELGARATH anxiously.  I found the historical view of the Old Wolf's life and times enlightening, interesting and at times hilarious.  Belgarath's parenthetical comments to his &quot;audience&quot; were well worth the price of admission. <br />  Still, somehow, the closure of the book somehow left me dry.  Even though Eddings neatly tied off almost every loose end left behind at the ending of the Malloreon, the end of BELGARATH left a definite impression of incompletion.   <br />  Will there be a POLGARA THE SORCERESS?  I hope so.  Will it be as satisfying as the Belgariad or the Malloreon?  Honestly, I can't see how.
1563523302|3.0|This is not a bad reminder of what we all know--save and invest for better financial health.  But the lifestyles of the millionaires mentioned were depressing!  &quot;My favorite charity is me&quot;???!!!  These aren't the kind of people that made our country great--these people are caricatures--an extreme end of the spectrum where greed is the motivating factor for everything!.  I don't buy it
0440180295|5.0|I just finished this book (For the second time) and I can not say enough about it!  The total satire that pervaded every idea we cherish in America cannot help but to force you to take a step back and look at us and how we live.  His casualness with attrocity, the comparisions between the chaos of World War II and the order of the Tralmafadoran's, the writings of Kilgore Trout... I cannot even begin to describe the complexities and though provoking ideas this book brought out in me!  A must have
0316921173|2.0|I was looking forward to a great novel that would make me laugh and cry and this was NOT it. This is the FIRST time I've ever not finished a book I've started. I have read the first 150 pages and find it very hard to follow as well as far too rambling

0062502182|3.0|I've just finished reading this brief novel, and have been mildly disappointed.  I spent several fine dollars on this book, purchasing it because of reviews on Amazon.com and because of the beautiful, waxy cover. When I began reading, the story started out quite nice, with a boy as a shepherd.  I would have liked to know more about his years on end of solitude and walking. Anyhow, do get to the point, the author got to the point too blatantly.  Hardly any subtlety was used by the author -- the moral was sitting in plain sight the entire time.  At time, the reading actually got tedious -- though if I say that I like to read story, I seem childish, I believe that the most effective way to get a point across is through complex and underlying weaves in and out of the plot, scene, symbols, and dialog.  So, if you see the book laying around and have a few hours to spare, read it.  Why not.  It was nice enough.  However, if you have anything else around that you think might be worth reading, it probably should be read before this one.  It just didn't cut it in the realm of inspirational literature, and I've read lots.
0380973634|5.0|As we haven't had the TV series yet downunder, I was lucky enough to read this first, and loved it. The usual Gaiman magic, laced with quirky humour and wonderful use of the classic London place names. For someone like me who lived in London some years ago and has fond memories, it was doubly delightful. First class stuff - highly recommended
0884271536|5.0|Critical Chain will revolutionize project management. &quot;Eli&quot; Goldratt's new business thriller has all the earmarks of a winner and no doubt will do for project management what The Goal did for production and It's Not Luck has done for marketing. This time, the story evolves in a university setting and our determined hero Richard Silver is an Assistant Professor in business who exudes natural teaching ability, but is a bit short on securing academic tenure. Critical Chain is as much an indictment of our current crop of non-relevant MBA programs as it is an expose of how TOC (Theory of Constraints) concepts can rejuvenate project management. Goldratt is well aware of the lack of relevance of some of today's university MBA offerings, as well as the growing list of companies creating their own programs, including such efforts as General Electric's highly regarded Crotonville leadership academy.  Never at a loss for a solution to problems which are first clearly identified using TOC methodology and associated Thinking Processes, Goldratt proceeds to solve project management uncertainties which, in the past, have defied even intensely focused, albeit more conventional solution attempts.  Transforming critical path technology into critical chain thinking, lies at the heart of Goldratt's TOC-driven project management philosophy. Using critical chain methods, the author shows us how to plan, implement, and execute projects according to &quot;real-world&quot; mandates, AND get them done in time and within budget.  TOC basics have taught us that every system has constraints and that invariably constraint time is more valuable than non-constraint time. This understanding is also basic to effective project management, as amply demonstrated by our story's other heroes, Professor Silver's students in his Project Management class.    Critical Chain's message is so logical and simple that it will probably take years before its &quot;revolutionary&quot; new technology will be accepted by today's critical path pragmatists. Don't waste your time with such uninformed skeptics. Hopefully, most of them will be working for the competition.  Read this book and find out how to use common sense, the TOC way, and complete your projects on time, every time.  Most of us have been involved with projects which didn't stand a chance of ever achieving their stated objectives. According to Eli, such predicaments are history, if you tackle them his Critical Chain way.  Bruno Lewandowski, Editor, World Aero-Engine Review.

(We actually had a waiting list for who got it next...)  I have read it several times and it gets better each and every time.  The characters are so deep and detailed, the plotline masterfully constructed.  The book reads like a runaway train, always going faster, never slowing.  The only problem with the book is that it ends.  (you'll see... when you are done reading it, you feel as if you have lost some of your friends...

0679735259|5.0|I'm a Vietnam veteran, and the first time I read 'Dispatches' I read it in one sitting. The next day, I read it again. I've since re-read it 10 or 12 times. I've read dozens of books about Vietnam and 'Dispatches' is the best at conveying how it looked and felt to be there. I recommend it to all Vietnam veterans, but don't think it should be the first book, or the only book non-veterans read about Vietnam. However, this should be one of the first three books anyone reads about Vietnam
0802130208|5.0|I'm sure 99% of the reviews here will rave about the humor of the book, so further testimonial regarding the comedic greatness of this book probably isn't necessary.       What else is truly special about this book, however, is its mastery of American written english, and its portrayal of New Orleans spoken accents of the early sixties.  As you read the book, you can hear the people speak and see the city in perfect, rich, and colorful detail.  Perhaps the best part is Toole's absolute ability to describe situations, objects, and people with perhaps the richest, most creative use of simile I have have ever seen from an American writer.  It's a shame that much of the language and subsequent humor will be lost to those who aren't American (although I believe quirky Brits will cry with laughter when they read this).         I am on to my second reading of the book, and the second time through is even better than the first. And each chapter, paragraph, sentence, and word is so complete, I can set the book down for a month and come back to it, and it seems as if I had just finished reading the previous chapter yesterday.           And of course I'm laughing all the while.  And the best part of it all?  The ending will not dissapoint the reader.  I half expected this book to end weakly, but it doesn't.         I will never forget this book, and most people I know feel the same way.  Too bad Toole killed himself.  Genious gone before it was even discovered, truly tragic.  But in reading the book, this fact only leads the reader to appreciate and be thankful that something of Toole was left for us to enjoy and admire.  I can only imagine that he must have been an incredibly amazing individual, and funny as hell!  Read it, this is a must for anyone, casual or avid reader.
0553565915|4.0|This book attempts to put our fears away about our dying but conflicts with mainstream Christian beliefs. Also there are questions about who the doctor was in which Eadie will not although he is dead. This book is laced with Mormon(whom she admits is an active member), newage, and occult views of point. As you read her later books, this becomes more noticeable. It is a book that you want to believe but I came away with the &quot;Oh_Oh&quot; feeling

It is unfortunate that Patrick Robinson has not read these authors, and had no clue.  Mr. Robinson, you claim to have used military advisors on this project.  Were they awake?  At least Hollywood MAY hire some REAL advisors to clean up the jargon and technical aspects.  Even his prose describing a fighter crash has no ring of reality or even plausibility.

0451175123|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  A libertarian's manifesto, Rand mercilessly tore into collectivism, which was something of a political reality - even in America - when the book was written.  While her characters are philosophically monolithic and extreme in their behavior, so much the better for their full development and the reader's immersion in the life-long struggle of architect/genius Howard Roark against incompetence and the status quo.  A work of philosophy that passes itself off as a page turner, Rand presents a compelling argument in favor of a capitalistic meritocracy ideal.  Brilliant writing and powerful thinking are merged in what will surely be regarded as a literary and philosophical classic centuries from now
0385472951|3.0|After having read all of Grisham's books (some more thantwice), I can say that &quot;The Partner&quot; is okay.  There is noother word that describes it more accurately in my opinion.  It is a good read on a very boring Sunday afternoon, if you don't play gholf. It is more in the league of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, which means I will not read it a second time.  It concerns a young innocent partner (yeah sure) who was very devious (in a good way) in dealing with his, oh so corrupt firm of older mean lawyers - sound familiar? Right on!  As with all of Grisham\222s other novels, it is an easy and somewhat absorbing read, but please don\222t expect &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; - It will not keep you awake until 2am the next morning, but might give you pleasant dreams.
B0000020C4|5.0|In this 10th Anniversary concert gala, preformers from all over the globe are brought together for this celebration for 10 years of success. Preformer Colm Wilkinson (Valjean) opened in London, and on Broadway, now making another mark he's in the concert. Philip Quast (Javert) comes from Syndee and was, I think, a member of the original cast, he's also on the complete symphonic recording. The Thenardiers opened in London, and Jenny Galloway also opened in London's new production of 'Oliver!' playing Widow Corney. Michael Ball (Marius) opend in London in Les Miserables, and Aspects of Love. Judy Kuhn (Cosette) also opened on Broadway with Colm Wilkinson. This recording far surpasess any of its kind; and I would recomed it to anyone who wants a taste of it. I could go on, and on with the story of all of the 250+ member cast, but I won't. END
0345315227|1.0|Despite being myself a fan of Arthur C. Clark, no doubt thisbook suffered a lack of continuity so great that even the apollogiesfrom Clark's own are not enough to justify this book...<br /> I am specially sad about the involution wich Clark aprouched the aliens, the creators of the Monoliths, and the completelly unsatisfying end to Hall and Dave Bowman. I read the first book delighted until the end, and one of the most delightfull parts is for sure when Dave Bowman pass through the Gate ( wich is Big Brother, something clear in the first book and its sequel...), seeing the mammoth space ports and gateways, some of them even being at use while he was passing by... That alone tells that the Monoliths creators mastered FTL travell, and this is completelly denied in this last book !!!How can he write that a message from the Monolith delays 450 years to reach it's Central, if Dave Bowman made the first trip almost instantly, and returned a few years later ??!! And we all know that his transformation to his new form happened in the Gates Central, in the surface of a Sun ( another beautifull part of the original book )and not inside the Big One orbiting Jupiter, something so repeated on this 3001... Of course this was one of the basis for the story, but so this must not be a sequel to 2001. Let alone the fact that the end of the star child is completelly out of the lines guided on the first books. Of course Dave Bowman became more than a computer image, from a stupid yet powerfull machine.<br /> Fact is, this so called sequell just levelled the Monoliths and its creators to a levell far under the preview books, and I prefer to stuck on the first ones, hopping that someday Clark or his collaborator, Gentry Lee (a great writer himself) maybe take notice of the terrible mistakes done in this story and fix it, giving a really sactisfatory end to this magnificent tale, something that we fans of this series are actually lacking right now. For me this book never happened, and letour voices get to mr. Clark, in order to make him notice our sadness about this matter... <br /> Claudio Marcos Maciel Leme,<BR> from S\343o Paulo - Brasil
0393038912|5.0|I ordered this book from one of my book clubs, hoping it might be good.  By the time I was halfway through it, I was raving about it so much that my local library had ordered a copy sight unseen, a friend almost took it away from me before I could finish it, and god only knows how many people he will pass it on to.  I may never see it again. It had never occured to me that some continents have a plethora of domesticatible animals and plants and some simply don't.  This is a complex book and would take pages and pages to review properly.  Suffice it to say that I read 10 to 20 books a week and haven't been caught by a book like this in years.  DON'T MISS THIS ONE!
0688021492|4.0|A delectable piece of near-non-fiction about one of the most evocative and emotive artists of the nineteenth century, Auguste Rodin. I came upon this book (original hardback with cover c. 1963) via the shelves of a former paramour  just after graduating from art school, a happy coincidence for a dewey-eyed artiste! Not a lover of the biography genre in particular, I devoured this  book nonetheless, in part because it is loosely-based fiction, but primarily because David Weiss has molded a remarkable figure in his story of Auguste Rodin.<br /><br />From his birth in Normandy in 1840 and first crayons at age five, through his tumultuous entree into the world as an artist (he was born to a minor police official), to the development of his work alongside some remarkable contemporaries (Monet, Renoir, Hugo, Zola, Rilke and Shaw) and the tragic affairs with Beuret and Claudel, it's a book you'll find hard pressed to close long after bedtime has come and gone (note: bring home the film _Camille Claudel_ when you have finished the book to add a little color to your perspective).<br /><br /> A minor flaw, which I quickly forgave as the characters emerged, might be the slightly formal tone (hasn't he heard of contractions?) in which Weiss, scholar before bestselling author, constructs his prose. Otherwise as powerful, colorful, and unforgettable a glimpse at the artist as Rodin's own Balzac.
1563523302|5.0|Many rely on &quot;Big Government&quot; or &quot;Others&quot; for Security and personal wellbeing. The Authors lay  out the basics of &quot;using&quot; our great system to &quot;be  personally responsible&quot; for youself and family.  A look over the reviews below reveals the vast  difference in approach to personal financial   freedom.  This book outlines the TRUE approach  that will lead to the systems greatest gift --  Financial security during one's own lifetime PLUS  the assurance of not being a financial burden on   one's own family or other members of society.  The   Authors have captured &quot;old ideas&quot; that still are  the ONLY ones that ASSURE these end results.  Good  reading -- A must for your Children, too!
0060175184|2.0|Yawn. A tedious tale from the master of the formula novel. Both the central characters are ruthless, charmless men, with whom it is very difficult to relate or empathise. After a short time I stopped caring who came out on top, because both were so despicable. This novel has many similarities to Kane and Able, but lacks the human element of that work.

0393038912|5.0|Why did Western Civilization defeat its competitors?  The short answer, according to Guns, Germs and Steel, is that it had the benefit of greater diversity, and that this diversity was the gift of geography.  More kinds of domesticated plants and  more kinds of domesticated large animals were available across Eurasia.  More kinds of food meant more people, thus more kinds of diseases (which other peoples weren't immune to) and also more new ideas.  Diamond does a great job developing this concept and exploring the implications.  Definitely a must read
0812550757|5.0|As a teacher, I have insisted that my high school freshmen all read Ender's Game.  The fast pace and excellent character development engage the students and lead them toward discussion of serious issues, like how we treat those who are &quot;different&quot; and the ultimate goals and purposes of education.  Speaker for the Dead has a different focus, and perhaps a different audience.  Although many of my students have read it because they so loved Ender's Game, not many were ready for its sophistication.   Speaker for the Dead works for me in its treatment of two major issues.  The first of these, expressed through the interaction (and its disastrous results) between the piggies and the humans, has to do with cultural relationships and the arrogant assumptions often made by the dominant culture.  The humans function at a level of cultural blindness hard to understand through most of the novel, and that blindness has tragic consequences.   The second issue I love in this book is the concept of the Speaker for the Dead, the role that Ender Wiggin has taken on in his adulthood.  A Speaker's job consists of traveling to places he is called to &quot;speak&quot; the life of someone who has died.  These itinerant Speakers come to the person's life completely objectively, and thus they are able to speak the truth about that person--good and bad.  The speaker helps the community deal with the person's death by allowing them to see that person completely; all the person's facets, foibles, and fortes are displayed.  I found myself thinking that if mopre people read this book, we might have a whole new funereal ritual to deal with.    In short, while of a completely different tone than Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead brings up some important issues, and it is well worth the time spent in reading it.  Invest several days in this book; it deserves them.  --Prudence Plunkett (Prudence_Plunkett@breadnet.middlebury.edu)

0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is a superb book about the struggle of a group of rabbits to escape the destruction of the only home they ever knew. They face problem after problem, each one unique and even more uniquely solved. The rabbits show characteristics similar to humans that give the reader a feeling of personally knowing the rabbits.   I first read this book in fifth grade in compliance to my teacher's request. If have since reread it six times in the course of a year (I think, I've read it so many times since then that I have lost track).   I am in the sixth grade and this book is still undoubtedly my favorite. Each time I read it I cry when I'm done. I always hate to end such a wonderful book. This book does not deserve just a 10 . You can't rate this book high enough. In a realistic and believable saga, this book takes you to places beyond Earthly boundaries, to the fascinating but overlooked world of the rabbit
1563523302|4.0|I couldn't wait to finish reading this book and then read these reviews: Certainly, there were going to be people who were going to hate it.  Why?  Because MND shows people that they have a choice, either to save their money and live happily, or squander their money and live large.  You can't do both, and too many people assume they can.  I'd rather sacrifice that annual trip to Paris and retire earlier, wouldn't you?  When my kids get older, they are definitely going to read this book.

006017322X|5.0|Having to read books in Mrs. Sewell's 8th grade english class is quite interesting.  Her reactions and facial expressions kind of put YOU in the story and then when you ask her questions she's secrative about it and wont tell you it's all creepy.  One day I couldn't stand it any longer I didn't sleep at all. I just stayed up and finished the book. it was FABULOUS.  I was on top of the world.  Thinking all day, daydreaming, putting myself in Scout's position or Jem's or Boo's or Miss Maudie's- I was everyone.  It was also great to have been &quot;let in &quot; on my teachers secret-the end and I never tell secrets so that was fun and.  (once everyone finished the book she showed us the movie, it was touching but the book changes your life with a MUCH deeper meaning) I found a deeper meaning to my almost 14 years.  I knew that who I was and what I stand for should be known.  I liked finally knowing the story but then... Mrs. Sewell told us that &quot;the trial&quot; (read the book to find out...) never happened TO Harper Lee - even though it really did happen.  Then what was the purpose? how much really happened? the anger could be there, but the situations???????  I was confused. But Harper must have really met Boo and talked extensively or else why would she live the way she does? (if this is Harper reading this then I am a great fan or yours, yet still confused and I wish you'd email me, I wouldn't tell anyone, secreta are always honored...)  if Dill was Truman Capote then what happened and Jem died? what about the older sister, she wasn't in the story....  This book is deep, but it keeps you hanging.  WHAT HAPPENED?  it is THE BEST book I've ever read and the unit my teacher did was pretty cool.The characters are so deep that they make you think more than any other book that I've ever read.  But it was Harper Lee that touched, changed, nurtured, tought, strengthened, and marked my life, forever... This is the BEST book ever written.
0441003257|5.0|Some time ago I got hold of a German copy of this book by chance. It is not a very well known book over here but I loved it immediately. It leads you to your worst nightmares and keeps you laughing till you reach the other side. You can read it 10 times or more without getting bored. This book is likely to be a cooperation between god and the devil and the result is entirely human. So better get yourselves a copy
B000002BE9|5.0|This woman/child has a lot to say, and she says it is a musical voice that is smoky, seductive, rebellious, vulnerable, and too wise for her years. Easily the most relevant of the &quot;serious&quot; new female artists, Fiona bares her soul without the triteness of Jewel. She draws her tension between the sensual and the psyche, wringing beauty and sadness from this emotional scale. This is one &quot;bad&quot; Apple that is likely to have staying power.

0812550706|5.0|I've read many of the reviews of Ender's Game, and I think I know what the people who rate it poorly (like a 2 or 3) don't like about the book.  It is NOT sci-fi.  Sure, it has to catagorized that way.  But the setting is incidental to message of the book.  I've read the book at least 5 times and I find something new and wonderful each time.  The characters Card creates touch you in such a way, that you are sad when the book comes to an end
0385121679|5.0|I loved this book.  It was disturbing on just about every level imaginable.  Unlike some later Stephen King narratives, King steers away from the gross-out, blood and gore imagery and takes us straight into the mind of a normal man, Jack Torrance, so that we can watch a living hotel tear it to pieces.  If you like to be afraid, read this alone in a big old house. You will not be disappointed, merely sleepless
0684874350|5.0|When I first started reading about Frank's life in Ireland I really didn't want to hear about his hardships and days of hunger. But when I began to realize that he never complained, never lashed back on those who were never there for him, I began to learn what an extra ordinary little boy (person) he really truly is. What a gift he has for telling a story of his childhood, the days of filth, the sickness, the deaths of his little siblings, and his father - an alcoholic. This book is about a real person living a life so unreal with so many hardships I truly believe its a miracle that he could survive. But the human heart does overcome such horrific hardships especially when the heart is small. I really thought the author deserved a Pulitzer! Frank McCourt was a guest on the Rosie O'Donnell show a couple of months back and I took her advise and read it. I am glad I did. I will be waiting for the sequel
0385486804|4.0|The cold, unforgiving climate of Alaska; the warm, giving heart of a 22-year old; and his tragic  but uplifting journey into the wild.   Jon Krakauer has written an intimate and sincere account of Christopher McCandless'  short-lived journey. The book, which is marked along the way with letters and diary entries of McCandless or &quot;Alexandra Supertramp&quot;, provides honest insight into the young man's hopes and dreams.  McCandless, seemingly comtemptous of his well-to-do roots,  chose to abandon family and society to pursue a path that he believed was the basis for the existence of the human spirit - the passion  for adventure.  His journey into the wild began in June 1990.  He started in Atlanta and passed through Houston, Detrital Wash, Grand Junction, Carthage, Cut Bank, Seattle, Astoria, Orick, Dawson Creek. He reached Alaska in April 1992. Four months later, his decomposed body was found in an abandoned bus there.  Krakauer has threaded together a compelling read, gathering information from McCandless' family and the people McCandless met along the way and whom were ultimately left with deep-lasting good impressions of a kid who was brave enough to heed the call of the wild.  Some Alaskan hunters, however, said McCandless was a naive kid who showed inadequate respect for the forces of nature and thus suffered the consequences.   I leave with you excerpts from a letter that McCandless wrote:  &quot;So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each dayto have a new and different sun.&quot
0553062182|5.0|This is the definitive guide for those of us too deep for typical &quot;self-help&quot; books.  It paints an appropriately subtle, complex and extremely accurate portrait of those who are highly sensitive, as well as providing thoughtful and balanced guidance on how to thrive in a society that devalues our gifts.  It addresses how we might do so responsibly, without using our sensitivity as a &quot;cop-out&quot; and how in so doing we may contribute to the betterment of both society and ourselves
0385472951|4.0|I can agree with many of the reviews here. In a nutshell; therewere very likeable characters, the story moved along very well, fairlypredictable.

0446364495|5.0|If you do not believe in the magic of possibilities, if you think sacrifice is a concept limited to religion, and if you have never truly fallen in love outside normal boundaries, this book is NOT for you. As I read the reviews of those who hated this story, I found myself thinking over and over, &quot;You just don't get it.&quot; Wrapped in what looks on the surface to be yet another trite love story, is a deep and complex telling of a tale of sacrifice. For those who read it in an hour, I say, &quot;Go back and read it again; you missed the point.&quot; In your haste, you read the words, but ignored the message. In today's society of instant gratification, you saw a small book and decided it required an equally small amount of dedication to reading it and truly listening to what it had to say. Try again, but this time devote a bit more effort to looking beyond the love story between these two characters and feel the heart of Waller's lessons. Life and love are never easy, the most perfect things sometimes come at inopportune times, and sacrifices are made in error that preserve the order of things in some lives while leaving the door on other lives opened but without closure. It is not surprising to me that most people would misinterpret this novel, that they would see only the love story that lies on the surface and ignore the depth of what lies beneath. Most people have never loved in the way that Waller writes about, so to them this will always remain just a &quot;Harlequin romance.&quot; But for those of you out there who have loved someone you shouldn't have at a time that wasn't right, this book will make you understand that what you did wasn't a sin. It was a gift. And maybe it will make you rethink your decision to live that life of quiet desperation doing what you should do for the sake of your family, and instead pack your bag and run with your &quot;Robert Kincaid,&quot; run hard and fast and without stopping even to take a breath. I did just that and only realized after reading &quot;Bridges of Madison County&quot; what my fate would have been if I hadn't

This is important, and about the only way to know what you are doing, if you don't spend every cent you make.<br />      3.  The book begins with the parable of the ant and the grasshopper, and leaves the impression that there can be no successful in-between, which just ain't true.

0060925000|3.0|After 'Golden Gate', 'All You Who Sleep Tonight' and all the ecstatic reviews in the Western press, I came to 'A Suitable Boy' with perhaps overblown expectations. I flung the book away in frustration about halfway through, a couple of years ago.  I am Indian myself, and I must say that in the years since the book was published, it has received uniformly lukewarm reviews in Seth's home country. Perhaps it is because while all the rich detail, the food, the languages, the social systems seem incredibly invigorating reading to the outsider, an Indian is left with the nagging feeling: 'so what's new?'.  Now that I have read it fully for the second time with far fewer epic expectations, I found a zesty, interesting page-turner, which is quite successful in trying to grapple with the huge complexities of Indian life in a comprehensible and fun manner.  Much of the book could in fact well be set in the 90s, since so much in India remains unchanged.  The book is definitely worth a read and Vikram Seth is an enormously talented wordsmith, but classic it certainly is not.  I wish Seth would get back to doing what he does best--write verse

0312932081|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card combines the best of Science Fiction with a riviting message about the human survival instinct.  The book follows Ender, a child genious and an outcast from society, through early childhood and on through the torments of the battle school.  He is in a society threatened by an alien race called the 'Buggers'. From the begining of the novel, the reader is made aware that Ender is considered the last hope for humanity. <br /> Card writes the book as though telling a wonderful story of Compassion in the face of complete evil. I feel that this novel should be required reading for anyone who considers himself human. you may find that some of the situations that Ender Wiggen goes through are not all that foriegn and that Card portrays society more accurately than most.

0553477838|3.0|While this book is well written, it should be looked upon as a history and not as a formula for success. It offers more in the soft-and-feeling area than in something that can be taken to the  bank. It does throw light on how well placed and open Grove is inside his business, and that should be a call to arms for all CEOs.  I found the book called Value Migration printed by the Harvard Business School more systematic on finding your edge competitors.  In fact there are a number of books on this same topic which are more useful.  I also think Grove's reason for the unseating of DEC, etc. from pre-eminent position leaves one questioning. I can't see a difference between Intel and Microsoft (Wintel) and DEC: Microsoft wants to own everything except the hardware (which it has given to Intel) and the applications,  which for the most are specific to a company and industry. This seems like DEC, except it wanted the hardware as well.  My own experience is that DEC had just plain bad marketing, and you need only look at the Alpha debacle to see the truth

From the first time I set eyes on it 16 years ago, I thought it was very deserving of every accolade it got, including - or especially - the Pulitzer.  It was very tragic that this was all posthumous.    I'll never understand how all those lame-balls in the publishing world had let this one slip by, not seeing the brilliance in Mr. Toole's keen insight and wisdom, and extraordinary literary talent.

0385472951|2.0|Once again Mr. Grisham has disapointed readers by failing toilluminate secondary characters to anything past cartoonish status.While Mr. Grisham is clever in his use of legal manuverings to generate plot lines; his failure to develop characters readers care about, causes one to speed through his recent books without a care. Books such as A Time to Kill and The Chamber created characters the reader should be interested in.  In his recent books, Mr. Grisham fails to develop what should be the most important element of any book, characters the reader can identify with, pro or con.  Perhaps Mr. Grisham should take a year or two off rather than continue to churn out movie scripts.  Harsh words, but spoken by someone who is truly a fan of the author.
0684800713|5.0|Lost Generations   <br /> Gertrude Stein said, &quot;You are all a lost generation.&quot;  She could have describing Generation X, but she was fifty years too early.  These words were spoken about another generation,  a group of young people who, after World War I, were feeling disconnected from the rest of the world.       <br />Many of them were living in Europe, living the &quot;expatriate&quot; life.  That meant they lived from meal to meal on borrowed money trying to develop an artistic lifestyle thousands of miles from everything and everyone they grew up knowing.    <br /> Just a few years ago, Seattle was a kind of Mecca among east coast Generation Xers.  Everyone I went to college with envisioned Seattle as the place where we could be ourselves.  Of course, we hadn't really defined who that was yet, and none of us had been there.  Yet, somehow, we knew that Seattle was the place to be.    <br /> Paris was the place to be for the original lost generation and Ernest Hemingway became one of that city's most celebrated adopted sons.  His semi-autobiographical novel The Sun Also Rises follows a group of young people trying to find themselves after World War I.     <br /> Jake Barnes, the main character, is a veteran with an unfortunate war wound which puts a damper on his dating life.  Lady Brett Ashley is the woman who loves him, and whom he loves, but also the woman he cannot have.  They are surrounded by a cast of painters, writers, editors, drunks, and a bullfighter named Pedro Romero.    <br /> Romero becomes the linchpin of the story.  Jake, Brett, and friends head off to Pamplona, Spain for the running of the bulls and the festival of San Fermin.  Jake is a bit of an aficionado of la corrida de toros and looks forward to initiating his less experienced friends.      <br />He did not anticipate, however, Lady Brett.  Brett is the female equivalent of a womanizer.  When she meets Romero, sparks fly and Jake is put into the uncomfortable position of acting as a go-between for the woman he loves and another man.     <br /> When the novel comes to a close, Jake is still lost, but is closer to finding himself.  The problem is he's not sure he likes himself. Maybe he should go to Seattle, have a mocha, and try to chill out  . . . or whatever.
0553266306|3.0|Even though some scenes in the book are worth being read, the whole story lacks of suspense and is therefore rather boring.<br />I have certainly read better thrillers than this one.
0312932081|5.0|This review is mostly a response to the negative posts above....please don't ruin the art of the best book yet written by reading this review before you get it.<br />  This book not only brought me into science fiction reading, it brought me into scifi WRITING.  This is the pinnacle of character writing, this book is the definition of Pathos.<br />  I've read every review here (took over 1 hour) and I have seen 2 groups of negative comments: <br /> 1. This is not hard scifi.   I know this.  It isn't SUPPOSED to be.  I've read a LOT of scifi, and believe me, Card knew what he was doing.  He didn't want you to be questioning his suppositions in the science world.  He brings in a few concepts to catch your attention but doesn't give you enough to DISTRACT from the flawless tale.  Hard core scifi is great stuff...but as a whole I find the characters there shallow, merely a vessel for a new scientific idea.  Here the characters are real, powerful, and beautiful.<br />  2. How can a child be so smart: Anyone who can't suspend their belief the little tiny bit that it requires to follow the story line isn't a reader, they are a critic, and not a very good one.  Ender is a genius, but he IS a child, or he wouldn't be put in the situation he was in.  What the critics are missing here is that Ender LOSES the game, and spends the next 3000 years trying to pay for that loss.  His innocence is his downfall.  I've known children that are introspective...not all are hyperactive sugar-bombs, some struggle just to gain acceptance in their own family.  He was born a &quot;third&quot; you may remember, and was subject to intense scrutiny his entire existence......how would you have behaved as a child?  I think you would have grown up in an awful hurry.<br />  Anyway....I am a hard core scifi fan.  I've read every book I've ever heard of from Clarke, Niven, Asimov.....these Scifi giants are fabulous and they help us shape our vision of the future.<br />  Card is a storyteller.  He doesn't base his books on the science.  He bases them on the character.  That's how the art works.  That's WHY the art works.  If you want pure science, pick up an engineering book.  Most people read for the thrill of the characters.<br />  Sure, it can be fun to calculate the testile strength of Ringworld &lt;yawn&gt; if you're an engineer....but if you're a human, this is the best book you will EVER read.<br />  Anyone who makes it this far down the review list would be on chapter 7 by now.  :)  Just go get the book, see for yourself.  Or maybe that advanced quantum physics book is more your style.  I guarantee you'll love one of them.<br />  PS I've bought ender's game 23 times, and given it away 22 times.  When someone asks me why I write SciFi, I give them a copy. Its become a textbook for me now.<br />  If I ever get to meet OSC, I'm going to shake his hand and tell him what an impact he has had on me as a Reader and as a Writer.  I'm sure he gets it daily, but when you're that good....well I guess it just goes with the territory.  <br />  Long story short......just go buy the book.  If you didn't get it, take a deep breath and read it AGAIN. heehe
0345350472|4.0|This, Dick's most famous book, is definitely NOT what you think it is going to be if you are picking it up after seeing the movie.  In fact, even if you have never heard of the movie, it is probably not what you are thinking it is going to be.  The book is a maze of questions and theories; especially exploring the familiar Dickian theme of identity.  (am I real, or manufactured?  Are my memories real, or programmed?  Are YOU real?) The story of the replicant (androids who mirror humans and often exceed them, but have a very short lifespan) hunter Deckard is fast, often funny (see the mood machine in the first chapter) and always intriguing.  He seems to have rushed his writing in a few places.  And at times I could tell he was keeping his concept down for the enjoyment of sci-fi readers.  Still, a good place to start with Dick, and one of the fastest reads you'll encounter
0345315227|3.0|I thought 3001 was two things: a mediocre (and somewhatsummary) stand-alone story, and a lousy ending to the Odyssey saga.Quite frankly, the best-written part of the book was the Epilogue, which consisted of three or four lines. <br /> The thing that really made me mad, though, was Clarke's arrogant dismissal of religion as an &quot;un-sane&quot; (sic) psychopathology. Oh, really?  Well, I'm sure that millions of readers who do go to church (or a synagogue, or a mosque, or whatever) will be extremely pleased to hear THAT! <br /> The bottom line: wait for the paperback. <br /> ACC
0877739587|2.0|Excellent book but the George Long translation is as inscrutable as the King James Bible without having entered into the English language tradition
0887307280|5.0|I read the first part of this book on a flight to Florida - I am sure nearby passengers thought I was looney, I was actually having fun with a &quot;business book&quot;! <br />This book really hit home.  As someone that has started 3 home-based businesses over the past 20 years and grown 2 of them out of the home, I had been there, done that.  When I saw ME as the example of how NOT to do it, I bonded completely.<br />  I am now on my last business start-up and I have completely revamped to follow this guide. It has given me a mental picture that is logical, doable and accountable.<br />Build your business in the shadow of Ray Kroc and flip the hamburgers just long enough to know how to do it right - every time.  Then write the book on flipping hamburgers and move on.  It's that simple! <br /> You CAN teach an old dog new tricks after all!
0446520950|2.0|After reading Baldacci's debut book &quot;Absolute Power&quot; I was really looking forward to &quot;Total Control&quot;.  Pace was too slow, story was &quot;padded&quot; with a lot of &quot;technobable&quot; (sp), jumped around too much and just not that interesting.  I'm not finished yet, up to page 170 (approx) and still waiting for the page-turner part
0399128964|5.0|Most of what can be said about Dune has been said already, so let me throw in my two cents briefly. <br /> No other single science fiction book I know of creates such a marvelous, believable universe.  From the religions of the future to the assassination weapons of the rich and targeted, from the mastery of mental and physical powers to the breeding program for a superbeing, and- ABOVE ALL- from the oceans and rivers of Caladan to the desolate, sandy wastes of Arrakis, it is easy to believe that Herbert researched this book for five years before writing it.  This is a masterpiece.  Buy it.  Read it.  And don't hold me responsible for any isolationary side effects.
0312853254|1.0|Take away all the recycled irritants from &quot;Ender's Game&quot; -- the characters who exist only to tell us how wonderful the hero is, the judgemental self-righteousness masquerading as Compassion (with a capital C, yes), the lead character who's always better at everything than the experts, and (of course) gallons and gallons of self-pity, Ender's mother's-milk, and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; still has at its core the mark of a bad novel -- the Big Secret that any idiot can guess before Chapter 1 is over.  Imagine mating one of Ayn Rand's crypto-fascist heros with one of those mystery novels where everyone overlooks the clue except the little old lady's cat, toss in some SF ideas cribbed from other novels, and we're done.<br />  I'm currently fulfilling a pledge to read all the Hugo-winning SF novels before the year is out, the only reason I finished this book -- really, the only reason I restarted &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, which I stopped reading midway through 15 years ago.  Some New Year's resolutions are more productive than others, I guess...
0312932081|2.0|I tried reading this juvenile SF novel when it first appeared, and stopped halfway through -- I was put off by the ludicrous subplot, in which the brilliant hero's sweet sister and mean brother (not deep characterization -- they only need one adjective each) use invented Internet alter-egos to take over the world.  Billions of people on the Web, and not _one_ has a single idea, except for Ender's siblings.  But that's the pattern of the book, a book that makes no attempt to describe the contentiousness or complexities of real life.<br /> Ender, the hero, is no more a character than, say, James Bond -- Ender always wins, always bests every obstacle, defeats every enemy, shames every teacher, with a mininum of effort.  Other characters exist only to extol or mirror his greatness; the handful who don't admit to his superiority are easily disposed of.  There's an almost pornographic feel to the final chapter, in which Ender founds a new space colony, saves the alien race he thought he had single-handedly destroyed, and invents a new religion(!), all the while wallowing in the self-pity that started at page 2 and never stopped.<br />  I would give this the lowest grade possible but for two factors -- Card is a facile, easy-to-read writer, and the book might do some good to bright pre-teen boys who aren't getting much support from their environment.  Of course, &quot;Playboy&quot; might too, but it isn't art either.  Not recommended for adults at all.
0151001820|5.0|The Club Dumas is an infuriating, compelling and always fascinating novel that bridges the gap between &quot;literary&quot; fiction and &quot;genre&quot; fiction. Poe, Christie, Doyle and many others receive homage within this story, which connects them with the long line of romance dating to Dumas and beyond. Borges and Eco are also included, suggesting that the gap between literary and genre is an artificial construct. The novel toys with the &quot;highbrow&quot; concepts of contemporary literary theory in establishing a tantalizing contest between reader and author that mirrors the contest between hero Lucas Corso and the mysterious figure(s) behind the novel's events. The novel delights in old books and playfully uses time-honored techniques from alluded-to works that still manage to challenge how we read and what we expect out of a story. Like the mysterious members of the Club Dumas, &quot;sophisticated&quot; readers are given the opportunity to savor an &quot;escapist&quot; fiction without the negative connotations usually associated with that term.  A rare breed, The Club Dumas is a page-turner that will have you pondering it long after you've turned the last page.
0590413872|4.0|Riveting.  Filled with suspense as the reader questions whether Lloyd will ever find anyone whose mother is of his own species.  This story  definitely bucks the trend of most of the children's picture books being published today which are either exceedingly preachy or insultingly simple. &quot;Is Your Mama a Llama?&quot; is  neither.  It is well-balanced between its illustrations and its narrative.  A clever surprise is inserted as Lloyd finds Llyn although  I would have preferred if she had been named Llullu which is what I would name a female llama if I had one.
067082187X|2.0|I found Albert Cohen's magnum opus \\"Belle due Seigneur\\" a very personal, idiosyncratic display of the workings of the internal dialogue. If nothing else, Mr. Cohen has caught the stuttering, semi-incoherent lilt of the person talking to themselves. His pacing is that of a daytime soap opera, and the internal chatter makes it very compelling and oddly reminiscent of Dune (Herbert Marshall).   Criticisms would include a cynical tone so profound that it becomes limiting.
0385472951|4.0|It's nost his best book. Runaway Jury is better, but I live inBrazil and he made a great job describing the cities hereperfectly. This book was a little bit predictable, except the end....
0451452739|5.0|You're the capatin of the ship 'Discovery' on your way to Saturn; to find something that holds a 3 million year old secret. Your actions in this voyage will determine the fate of humanity, and yours as well. Arthur C. Clark paints a world of the furture that is about to find out the answere to a question humans have asked for years; are we alone in the universe?
0425156842|4.0|Sophie is a young girl who recieves instructional letters in philosophy in her mailbox. As the book progresses, she becomes acquainted with her mysterious teacher and Gaarder begins to track the progress of Hilde, a girl about Sophie's age. Somehow, Hilde and Sophie's lives are linked through Sophie's philosophy course.     &quot;Sophie's World&quot; was an exciting read, in a sense - that may be because I was taking an introductory course to philosophy when I read it, and was able to push through pretty fast. There's a clear division in the beginning, between Sophie's life and the text of the letters she's receiving. Here, I admit I was reading the book more for the Sophie part than the philosophy. This changed, however. Truth is, there's not much to the character of Sophie. After awhile, her part of the dialogues between her and the teacher became nothing but mindless prompts. What are her interests? She goes camping, once, and she has one friend, but other than that, she hardly has an identity.       Gaarder follows the history of philosophy chronologically, and does an excellent job of illustrating how it develops over the centuries. Contrary to first approach, I began reading for the philosophical parts of the book rather than for Sophie. Or Hilde. (There's not much to Hilde, either.) Gaarder's characters are shamefully underdeveloped, but he makes up for this with the philosophy, which he presents with pure genius. In the second half of the book, the focus is on individual philosophers, rather than philosophy as a historical/intellectual movement. The chapters devoted to Democritus, Darwin, Kant, Hegel, Sartre, and particularly Sren Kierkegaard, are fascinating.       The ending to &quot;Sophie's World&quot; was outrageous. I think that this, in addition to the faceless characters, is the main drawback of the book. In my opinion, there's a lot of buildup throughout the book that goes to waste. Perhaps I didn't fully comprehend what was going on. Then again, something tells me that even if I did completely understand the ending, it would be inconsequential anyway.       My recommendation? Do not read this book if you are looking for a literary masterpiece. You must read this book from a philosophical point of view. Whether you know much about philosophy or not doesn't matter - it serves well as an introduction to the subject, or simply presents a new way to look at philosophy for the more learnd. I even recommended it to my religion instructor, a PhD in philosophy. I think that it's worth the time, because it's something unique and different; unlike any book you've ever read.
1573225517|5.0|The best novel about agonizing over a relationship since Ann Beattie's first novel, Chilly Scenes of Winter. So Much of High Fidelity reminded me of that novel. In fact that girl's name was also Laura. This certainly is a great first effort! One of the best since Beattie's
0385486804|5.0|This book has been one of the hardest to put down.   Incredibly well-written, it take the reader not only on a journey of the life of Chris McCandless, but others like him, and the author himself.  In many ways it will allow you to better understand yourself, and a part of the human mind that many of us bury.  The life of Chris McCandless is not only interesting and bewildering, but incredibly brave and respectful; and at the same time, very creepy, with some passages sending chills down your spine.    READ IT!  You won't be dissapointed.
0553103547|5.0|If you have not read this book, read this book!  It is as simple as that.  With some books you can get a feeling of where the book is going, what will happen, who will die, so on.  With a Game of Thrones, this does not happen.  From the first page, you are thrown into a maelstrom of events and people, all going in different directions.  Threads of people and events weave around other threads, and you never know when or if they will end.  Martin never takes the easy way out, never taking the road most traveled.  This book is truly a unique experience and a read worthy of any lover of fantasy who has found things lacking in other books.  There is nothing lacking in this book.  Wait, yes there is.  The sequel is not out yet
0380002930|5.0|Okay, maybe you know Italian, maybe you even know Russian, but you can really impress your friends when you tell them you speak Lapine (that's Rabbitese, for the rest of us)! <br />    That's really the only way I can tempt my adult friends to read this marvelous book. I mean, hey, how many grown-ups are going to read a book I describe as &quot;the exciting and heartrending adventures of bunnies&quot;? It sounds like Beatrix Potter doesn't it? <br />    Well, it's not! In fact, it can be downright scary and tragic. And like Tolkien's characters, there's depth to these rabbit's lives...they have history, religion, language. It's like the anthropology of lapine culture. Nope, it's not exactly Peter Cottontail, folks. <br />    Some people want to be rich, some people want to be powerful. I just want to be a rabbit in Hazel's warren so I can chew the clover with he and Bigwig. <br />    Read it and weep
0140009345|5.0|It is almost incredible that such an old book contains  so much fresh wit and humor. Humour is not an easy  genre. It is much easier to write a tearful masterpiece than a joyous one, humoristic but not vulgar. I really find few   allegedly humorous books that lived up my expectations. This did.<br /> The plot is simple and common to most of the Wodehouse's books featuring the   immortal Bertram-Jeeves pair: Bertram Wooster is    a young rich englishman with an almost genial butler Jeeves. Bertram has plenty of pretty absurd   relatives (expecially aunts, see also the great:   &quot;Aunts are not gentemen&quot;) and get always involved   in funny troubles. At the end, only the help of Jeeves' oversized brain can lead to the expected   happy end. <br /> I know, this resume sounds just plain stupid (don't hate me). But the book  is better than   this. The strengh of Wodehouse is in the wonderful   use of the language. Maybe you cant help laughing   only twice reading the book, but every single line   put a cherub-like smile on your face. (My wife,   for instance, can always guess when I'm reading   Wodehouse.) <br />   I will add only 2 comments.<br /> 1) Wodehouse had written several books with Bertram and Jeeves, so if you like   this one you have found a mine of joy for the darkest spots of your life.<br />   2) If english (or american...) is not your native language, then this book is both a challenge and a reward. I'm italian, and - dash it ! - I've learnt a lot of words!

0553473328|5.0|I don't think I've felt this personally about fictional characters since I was 12 and reading The Lord of the Rings.  However, it _is_ proving to be inconvenient to be hopelessly in love with a figment of somebody else's imagination- not to mention difficult to explain to my husband! I was lucky enough to find the series just after Voyager was published, so I didn't have to suffer withdrawal that time around, but it will be a long dry spell before the next tome comes out- I'm not even going to think about how long it will be until the last one.  The only other books that come close to being so engaging and absorbing are (some of) Laura Kinsale's; with the Outlandish books one has the added advantage of getting to experience the whole scope of Claire and Jamie's lives together, not just the falling-in-love and the first few obstacles. I would highly recommend these books to anyone who hasn't read them yet; unless of course you have the willpower to wait another 6 years or so to spare yourself what will surely be a frustrating wait to get all the answers! :
B0000020C4|5.0|This CD set is a must have for any Les Mis fan's collection. It is, in my opinion, the closest to a 'dream cast' recording that has been released on CD thus far. Colm Wilkinson is amazing as Valjean, outdoing his previous performances on both the Broadway and London cast albums (again, in my opinion) Philip Quast is incredible as Javert; he captures the character perfectly. Lea Salonga as Eponine and Ruthie Henshall as Fantine are fabulous as well - by far my favorites in their respective roles over all others who have been released in recording. Although several songs are cut short or edited, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase. I personally find the sheer talent of the performers as a group stunning - this CD is definitely $20 well spent! END
0451160916|5.0|Stephen King is the best horror author I have read.  The Shining is one of his better books, besides Needful Things.

0812550706|5.0|I just read a number of the reviews, and am about to order a copy of the new edition.  This can't really be much of a review, since it has been several years since I read it, but the impressions it left are quite clear.  When I read it, I literally could not put the book down.  The story was so fascinating, that I was hungry for more after that last page.  I immediately bought &quot;Speaker for the Dead,&quot; and started that while my spouse read Ender.  At the time, Card was just then writing &quot;Xenocide,&quot; after an extended period during which he ignored the series.  We found ourselves checking regularly with the bookstore (Amazon.com would have been great for this!) to see if it had been published yet, and when it finally did come out, we had to buy 2 hardcovers to avoid fighting over the book!  (Which ended up being the weakest of the three).  Card is an amazing author, whose subjects range from rending tales like &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (not about  vampires), to &quot;Ender&quot;, all of which have ranked somewhere from above average to masterpiece.  I look forward to reading the revised &quot;Ender's Game&quot;
0582084865|5.0|&quot;Rebecca&quot; is an absolutely outstanding book. While combining English charm and elegance with the arrogance of the aristocracy, Du Maurier creates a sense of intriguing charm and superb realism. One can sense the mysterious surroundings at the ever-elegant Manderly mansion while still remaining attached to the haughty Mrs. Van Hopper introduced many years before. &quot;Rebecca&quot; is well worth anyone's time
0553477838|5.0|Love him or hate him, Andy Grove has written a very readable book. I'm not sure that the decision to stop making DRAM chips has an immediate analog in my life or career but it is an interesting story. Of all the business/computer industry books that I have seen this was the easiest read
0440111498|5.0|Since I first read this book as a sophmore in highschool, I have reread it at least 5 times.  If you have ever questioned how society is impacted by science and religion,  you must read this book. I have loaned my copy of the book to numerous friends, and every person has gotten something different out of the book.  Every time I read it, a different aspect of Vonnegut's social commentary becomes apparent to me.  Unlike many other books by Vonnegut,  you do not have to read any of his other books to understand the plot
0671701800|5.0|I first read this book several years ago when it was first published.  I've re-read it a couple of times since then.  I've never been much of a Carl Sagan fan, but I am a fan of hard SF and I figured that an astronomer who was so dedicated to SETI would have an interesting take on first contact.  I was right.  The science is great, the character development is better than minimally acceptable, the writing is excellent, and the story is a hoot!  I have a hard time believing that anyone who likes hard SF won't love this book.  I think it's destined to become a classic
0517543052|5.0|Why would anyone run away from a fast-track, high-status career to study meditation on a mountaintop? Read this book and you might be tempted to book your own passage to India. With astonishing honesty and humor, Baba Ram Dass describes his bumpy journey from anxious academic to psychedellic evangelist to spiritual teacher --- and shows us ways to find our own paths. I've travelled around the world, moved from east to west and back again, and held on to this gentle guide for 16 years. A lovely book
0451169514|5.0|King is a master. Is characters are so well developed that you feel like you know each one of them. His narrative is execllent, and while reading this book yoiu feel that the horror of It could well be real. I was gripped by this book as if gripped by Pennywise himself. I could not put it down, even though if would keep me awake at night. As I am only 15, this book really had an impact on me, I felt like Pennywise was always waiting just around the corner, just as he is in the book
094113086X|5.0|In the most basic sense of the word.  My father searched for years to find this book, having read a review of it long ago.  When it was published again, my father took advantage and spent the better part of a year passing copies of this book along to many fortunate individuals like myself. (You must understand that my father is not the kind of man who would give away books that he LOVES.)  My copy alone has passed through the hands of another 10 people.  That fact alone is an incredibly favorable review.  There is something fundamentally heartbreaking and awe-inspiring in this tale.  While reading it in the comfort of your home, it is hard to imagine the initial thrill of fear in escape, the consuming thirst of the Gobi desert, and the intense cold of the Himalayas.  To have endured so much so that when they came across the yeti, its peculiar existence atop frigid mountains was not as extrodinary when compared to the plight of their own trek, even to the reader.  The simple carnal desire for survival propelled them (and us) past a creature of legend and on into India.  So few humans have lived to tell of an experience of that magnitude.  Therefore, how many of us can truly comprehend it or express our empathy without paling in comparison?  All I can do is to continue to pass this book along.  I am online to purchase a copy for my new in-laws.  That is the best form of compliment I can think of.
0060920084|3.0|The cover and liner blurbs of &quot;savagely funny&quot;, &quot;facetious text jollies&quot; (you have to expect something complete undecipherable from the Scots), and &quot;..a serious indictment of the American way of life&quot; seem a little over the top for a decidedly readable travelog.  Bryson's book was meant for consumption during the inevitable airport delays and seems to comfortably fit in with those who prefer to read USA Today and spend a couple of hours each evening glued to the tube. <br /> I found the most interesting parts of the book to be when Bryson talked about his family, his own community, and, yes, Mr. Morrisey the milkman.  Since this was written nearly a decade ago, some of his observational wit would be considered a tad politically incorrect these days.  I would have liked to have seen the author spend a little time in some of the &quot;forgettable&quot; bergs along his travels in an attempt to probe deeper into why these people are where they are and do what they do.  The glossing over, with distain of places like Cripple Creek and Wiscasset, caused me endless disspointment throughout the book.  <br />  Having lived as an expat in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for 14 years, and originally coming from the Midwest myself, I did identify with Bryson's &quot;stranger in my own land&quot; sentiments.  There is considerable truth to the term of reverse culture shock and this book's strength lies in Bryson's repeated examples of an expat's &quot;selected recollections&quot; when comparing home to his/her home away from home.  <br />  Put this book in your briefcase or carry-on bag.  Recommeded reading for world-travellers and required reading for expats making their way back to the U.S.A. after a few years abroad.
0553280325|5.0|Ray Bradbury's stories always manage to pierce through into a deep sense of longing. They leave you unsatisfied (because they do come to an end) yet, at the same time, filled with pleasure at the rightness of just how he does it (Dark They Were and Golden-Eyed, for example).   Something Wicked This Way Comes is no different. The struggle between evil for the possession of the boys' souls and the love, bravery, and sacrifice elicited from Will and his dad just knocks you out.  The increasing pace, the looming threat, and the ever more clearly defined personal consequences of squarely facing it, all rachet up the tension in perfect phase--you'll know it when you get to that special chapter. Once I began this book, I did not stop until I finished it. Do not pollute your mental imagery with the movie version. Trust your own imagination. Read the book!  Greg Jefford
0380002930|5.0|Richard Adams' talent of writing really shows through this book.  You really can become part of the novel which this book does.  This book is one of the best adventure books that I have ever read and is right up there with my other favorite books such as The Lord Of The Rings.  This is truely one of the books that I will keep on reading over and over again
0812505085|5.0|Stevenson's &quot;Treasure Island&quot; is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely. My personal favorite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost schitzofranic.  His one side is well-mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven. In Part One, &quot;The Old Buccaneer&quot;, the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily &quot;to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street.&quot;  This is truly good, almost humorous, foreshadowing.  The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has traveled with.  Thank you, Robert Louis Stevenson, for contributing one of literatures' most amazing works.
044651506X|5.0|Although parts of the plot were precicatable and somewhat unbelievable, nevertheless, Plum Island was still an enjoyable read. There was enough suspense and plot twists to keep the reader from getting bored with those aspects that were predicatable however, the best part of Plum Island is not so much the mystery and suspense as it is Nelson DeMille's sense of humor. I laughed out loud at many of his one-liners and if you don't read slowly enough you'll miss some hilarious innuendoes. If you're looking for a mystery story with some humor sprinkled in, you may be disappointed, but, if you're looking for a humorous story with some mystery on the side, you'll be thoroughly entertained

0684874350|5.0|I resisted this book at first but soon was totally captivated by it.  I think what I liked best was the fact that it is language, literacy and literature that rescues Frank from this abject poverty.  I read it while preparing for an imminent trip to Ireland, and right on the heels of reading How the Irish Saved Civilization, so I feel steeped in Irish lore and life. For anyone who has turned to literature in order to deal with a life less than ideal, this book is a marvelous revelation
0553477838|5.0|Having personally worked (and plan on working for after I graduate from college) for Intel, Corp. Mr. Grove offers some of the insights to the success of Intel. Strategic Inflection Points (SIP) are applicable in any business, but in a high tech world, SIP's tend to occur more often.  Mr. Grove, currently also teaching at Stanford Business School, offers examples of SIP's and how he, and Intel, has dealt with these market changing pressures. In addition, through his book, he also gives insight to the type of company, and corporate culture that is present at Intel, and how only through this type of verticle cooperation can a Santa Clara start-up become the techology giant it is today.  I recommend this book to anyone who has ever heard of the name &quot;Intel&quot; and discover what it really means to be &quot;Intel Inside&quot;

0894808532|5.0|This is not a book you want to carry onto an airplane with you. To be honest, this is not a book you want to read in /any/ public place, unless you mind being looked at strangely. This book, you see, is funny. Very funny. Hysterically funny. Funny enough that it will have you laughing aloud despite yourself, even if you're /not/ familiar with the various areas they are referring to. Even the endnotes and author blurbs are funny (no joke!) <BR> Fans of Terry Pratchet and Neil Gaiman alike will find this book suffused with their usual zany humor, footnotes and all. Where else can you get the Antichrist lost and have an angel and demon in cahoots with each other to find him? Where else can you find such satire interwoven into a story rife with a madcap plot? Here, definitely.  <BR>  Highly recommended, even if you're not into the whole fantasy scene -- this book requires an appreciation of humor and the desire to laugh, so sit back, open a page and enjoy it while it lasts. And keep it handy for when you need a smile.
9997699629|5.0|When I first read Catch 22, I was enthralled, the way it moves between hilarious episodes and then chokes the laughter is hardly to be superseded. Actually even Joseph Heller himself only came close with the sequel Closing Time\\". Since my first copy I now own my third copy because the older ones were falling apart from being read so much by myself and all those friends of mine that I could persuade to check it out. As soon as I find the time I will read it for the fourth time and it is the only book that I read more than twice. And I don't think there is any praise higher than wanting to read a book again and again and being sure to find some great detail that you might have missed the last times.  It is a definite must have\\"!
0062513990|1.0|I found the style of writing in this book to be so trite that it was an effort to turn each page. The leading female character, Pilar, is an insecure, inexperienced, sheltered woman who seems to have no confidence in her own instincts. The recipient of her emotional interest is uncommunicative and simply drags her along on his journey through the Pyrenees. It's hard to recommend that anyone spend their time or money on this one
0679745203|2.0|An excellent example of a book written with an audience in mind. Contains all the right trappings for appeal to the modern upwardly mobile.

0380778556|5.0|REBECCA is the underlying novel for the Academy Award winning Hitchock classic movie and a recent Masterpiece Theater entry.  REBECCA is a story seen through the eyes of a young girl who we only know by name as the second Mrs. DeWinter.  She meets the charming, dashing and much older Maxim DeWinter in the South of France while she is employed as a paid companion.  After a whirlwind romance they marry and he wisks her off to his hom e in Cornwall:  Manderley.  Manderley really is the main character of this gothic romance.  The girl projects all of the insecurities brought on by youth and inexperience onto Manderley and the title character Rebecca.  The most enjoyable part for me of reading REBECCA is the description of the house and grounds, the dishes and the bushes.  Maybe Martha Stewart read REBECCA in her formative years.  Daphne Du Maurier departs from the classic &quot;whodunit&quot; and is more concerned with the character of the place and the people involved.  She shows us magnificiently how perception and reality can be almost diametrically opposed at times and the consequences of our often wrongheaded but very natural assumptions about other people and their motives.  A wonderful read
1556154844|5.0|This is the most objective book I have seen about software construction.   The concepts are presented simply and in logical order.   Every coding method is presented against its alternatives with strengths and weaknesses of each.  The text is not specific to any language or application.   It should be compulsory reading for all students wishing to become software professionals (or reviewers of software or managers of software projects).  As an experienced programmer you will recognise all those &quot;unwritten laws&quot; about writing good software and help you to formalise these so that you can improve and inspire your team's work.  All-in-all &quot;Absolutely Excellent&quot
1561007420|5.0|Alex Garland takes on the fascinating and complicated world of &quot;backpackers&quot; in South East Asia, and while his lead character had potential to be a real icon of the young adventurer today, the uninspired plot and the lack of development of supporting characters never deliver on that potential.  Anyone who has spent time in the part of the world Garland describes knows that Thais are more than drug-running killers or corrupt policemen, and the &quot;backpacker&quot; world he describes is not peopled with strung-out hippies with no connection to a &quot;real world&quot; -- the world of Kho Sahn Road in Bangkok and the islands of Koh Samui and Koh Phagnan -- that Garland's characters deride.  Garland begins to delve into the unique psychology and drive of the young traveler, then abandons that far more interesting line of inquiry in favor of a paranoid and not very sophisticated thriller with not much punch.  Nevertheless, the book is imaginative in it's structure and narrative and the protagonist Richard, a young Brit, runs the emotional gauntlet from blissed out escapism to shear terror.  Garland's book could have been great but the world he describes deserves more subtle descriptive and the lack of character development - most of the supporting players are mere carictitures of humans (which Garland himself tweaks with imagainative nicknames like Daffy and Bugs) - leaves the conclusion of the story flat and unsatisfying.  Still, Garland has a way with dialogue and the tale can be a fun ride if you don't expect too much
0060922583|1.0|If the world was a pineapple, than Mr Talbot could explain it in his model. Although some of the concepts are intriguing, Mr. Talbot's flair for stating the &quot;obvious&quot; when bieng highly subjective is so far from objectivism that it makes one question his profesionalism, if not his sanity. His sources for ancient data are questionable, and he seems to ignore a great deal of data to reach his conclusions. This book is for you if you have the emotional need to create fantasy where fact is not enough
0684874350|5.0|I loved this book and it was particularly special in that I seemed to almost HEAR it; what a delightful, amusing, heart-rending experience.  If I had to criticize, I would say that McCourt (as is the case with so many writers) lost the pace at the end of the book, or maybe did not know how to wrap up a story that had so much more to tell.  Contrary to some comments I read here, I believe that the Church often failed McCourt (as do all institutions run by man) but it is the faith from that church that ultimately sustained the family through unthinkable hardship
0345349571|5.0|This was a re-read for me. I completed it in 1989, read it several times afterward and started it again this summer. Some have critized it for &quot;disorganization&quot;. History is disorganized. Ms. Tuchman does a great job of putting us there in that time, with those people. We can see ourselves, we can see our origins and origins of things that are with us today. An absolute must in understanding Europe in the 1300's. A marvelous book that speaks to us about days past.

0385472951|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this Grisham book.  It was a page turnerthat I read in less than a day.  I still like the Pelican Brief thebest, but thought this one was better than some of the others.  I was disappointed in the ending, but, then I always was a romantic at heart!
0440213525|3.0|Grisham has written a number of great legal thrillers, but this isn't one of them.  The story revolves around a young boy who witnessed a crime and is now being hunted by organized criminals.  He gets help from a lawyer, who tries to make a bargain with the state for his testimony.  Unfortunately, the final solution which the boy and his family accept was the same as one proposed and rejected by the family several hundred pages before.  The book is fast-paced, and even quite tense and intriguing in some places, so it is not a book to avoid.  You just must look past the obvious solution and the cop-out ending
0451163532|5.0|Facts are facts, and this reporting is a must-read for all people, especially in a democracy, where so much depends on the attitude of each individual. We see by example what humans really CAN do for good. An individual who has indeed accomplished a great feat, albeit  with the help of others, is entitled to the respect that such activity commands. Follett's book shows not only Perot's strength of determination but also his appreciation for others' ability and his sincere interest in &quot;getting the job&quot; done - as evidenced by his hiring those most capable to do it and trusting THEM to use THEIR judgment regarding the remaining makeup of the group, the necessary preparation, and the implementation of the plan for rescue.We can accomplish so much more than we think we can

This is one of the best introductory volumes that I have read in a long long time
0395860210|4.0|Philip Roth has written a devastating indictment on the decadethat strangely enough he had a role in creating. His chronicle ofNewark's demise is the most interesting part of this novel.
0451169514|4.0|The 10 years have passed and I still haven't read this fantastic story again. I loved it so much it's kind of difficult to go back to it once more for fear of being disappointed. The evocative reminiscing of childhood adventure simply supercedes any of King's horror writings. As in The Body, King clearly clicks when relating the spirit of adventure, something we seem to lose as we grow older. It goes well beyond its premise of Good versus Evil. It is all about the amazing boldness and courage that only children can ever understand. The world of &quot;It&quot; is naive innocence. It is a world we all yearn for now we are old.  The master of the Horror genre undersells himself in his pursuit of cheap thrills. If only S.King had the courage to follow his true genius, he could surely stand up tall amongst the literary greats of the last 50 years.    I will read &quot;It&quot; again, but not yet.

0684874350|5.0|OK, usually I'm too poor to buy hardbacks, but this was an excellent investment.  I won't rehash all the same compliments posted by others, but I must say one thing about this book:  the biggest complaint people have about it is that McCourt's life was too poverty-stricken/ depressing/ repetitive /whatever.  LOOK.  This isn't some kitschy happy-ending novel.  It's a PERSON'S TRUE LIFE STORY.  If you wanted an exciting, glamorous life, go read some dumb Danielle Steel.  McCourt spent 20 years living the life portrayed in this book.  If you want to enjoy it for what it is, the mere hours you will spend entwined in his story will put a lump in your throat, but it is probably nothing compared to what McCourt went through in his own mind putting it on paper.  The amazing thing is that it makes you laugh, and makes you think as well.  Congratulations go out to him on such a perfectly told story of stories... believable from the childlike voice on the first page
0679745203|5.0|The English &quot;Patient&quot; is a literary masterpiece. The non linear format is one the most captivating features of the book. Of course, the work deserves its own share of credit, the complexity of the interwoven stories, and the artistry which Ondaatje used to tie the plots together make this book an unforgetable read. The story grows on the reader and in the end one cannot help but cheer for each of the characters. This is a book for the serious reader, not a quick read. If your literary tastes lay along &quot;bodice ripping novellas&quot;, you are wasting your time. &quot;The English Patient&quot; is to be savored, to be read more than once, to be put with your other treasured books. This is a serious candidate for the title of Classic. &quot;The English Patient&quot; deserves to share the shelf with Austens, Brontes, and  Alcotts.
0553266306|5.0|The Day of the Jackal is an incredible first novel by Frederick Forsyth. The amazing thing is, besides the fact that you know he does not succeed in killing President DeGaulle of France, he does not kill anyone for most of the book, and yet all the heads that roll in the different governments because no one can catch him, makes this a fascinating story, defininitely unputdownable
0440117658|5.0|This is my first Vonnegut novel.  With a quick pace and bizzare set of stories it kept me intrigued through and through.  In my experience people either label Vonnegut as one of the best authors of our era, or merely as a gifted entertainer, both are accurate.  I find his writing style compelling and very powerful.  The story unwinds slowly, but you are forced to follow Vonnegut's mind to find out how or where you will turn up next, whether it be listening to a twelve year old wallow about his ignorant father, or curiously watching as the chairman of NBC loses yet another wife.  If in reading a book you desire to see only the plausible happen then look elsewher, for here you never quite know what psychological quirk might be next

0671004611|2.0|The reader of this work is given a taste of its  ideological bent upon reading the forward by  Senator Strom Thurmond. Thurmond's forward praises  Lt. Col. Corso's impeccable military credentials   without discussing the books premise - that is that  the Cold War was won in no small part due to the  successful reverse engineering of Alien artifacts  recovered at the Roswell crash site in 1947.    Corso's book is replete with generalizations   regarding the so-called Alien technology found at  Rozwell; however, he offers nothing more than   unsupported generalizations.  The various appendices   in the book are disjointed and are unrelated to the  book's premise that the U.S. Military and Industry  used Alien technology in developing key weapons   systems as SDI, the Stealth Bomber, lasers, etc.    It appears that the appendices were added as  fillers.  They add nothing and confirm less.    Even more puzzeling than the disjointed appendices  are the photo inserts.  I mean what do photographs  of the author's son playing with a robot he has built  and Corso shaking hands with US Officers during his  visit as Inspector General have to do with Alien  encounters, Rozwell or UFO's?  Again their   insertion suggests filler.  The other photo   insertions illustrating alleged UFO encounters  offer nothing new and depict the popular photos  familar in many UFO publications.  Considering  Corso's access to confidential files and his  reference to the &quot;Nut File,&quot; (his term for the  Rozwell documents), one would expect exciting new  disclosures.    A question that Corso never addresses in the book   is why has he now come forward to discuss the   so-called cover-up?  One can suspect that he  wishes to cash-in on the 50th anniversary fervor.  I know he &quot;hooked&quot; me.    The book's release date does little to deminish   this motive.    The books ending is also puzzeling.  Who is the  mysterious person (presumably Russian)speaking   with Corso and why is it there?Throughout his book,Corso defends the government's  right to &quot;lie&quot; for the overall good of the nation.  Is this book full disclosure or another attempt at  disinformation?  Considering the lack of documentaion  and official citations, I am inclined to believe  the latter.
0345404475|5.0|<br />&quot;People had already stopped laughing about SF, but had not started reading.&quot; K. Dick once said. It's a pity, as most people would get really impressed at how much literary consistency a book like &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot; has in its 224 pages. <br />The author, Philip K. Dick, is known as one of most prolific writers in modern American literature. Compared with Borges by the also SF writer Ursula K. Leguin, and with Kafka by the cartoonist Art Spiegelman, K. Dick has a unique way of presenting his reality. The singular of the word reality maybe is not the best way to represent K. Dick's writings. Realities, shifting unstable realities, are more close to what K. Dick accomplishes with his books, never leaving the reader on a safe ground. <br />&quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot; is a good example of Mr. Dick ability. The main plot is the story of a cop specialized in killing runaway androids, locked in an empty earth were all smart people had already set sail for space colonies, and starting to feel strange about his job. Rick Deckard, the cop, is a good man, who's biggest dream is to have a REAL animal, flesh and blood, which is very expensive in a world were everything have been replaced by metal and circuits.   <br /> This story is a perfect scenario for K. Dick show us how volatile is our notion of real. As the book goes, he twists around everything that he himself gave as certain in the beginning. Deckard MAY be an android implanted with memories of somebody else, Mercer, the modern equivalent of Jesus, MAY be a god or a fake, Isidore, a retard, MAY be the only one to understand the truth of this world. All this &quot;mays&quot;, together with a precise and hard way of writing, makes &quot;Do androids...&quot; a test for your notion of reality. But, in nowadays,  who really has a precise notion of reality?  <br />For all that, and much more, &quot;...of electric sheep?&quot; is a burst of creative writing, as good as any really inventive book, anywhere and anytime, not just a &quot;good SF book&quot;. I was going to say that &quot;Do androids dream of electric sheep?&quot; is a &quot;modern classic&quot;, but I gave up. There is nothing of classic in this book, and everything of modern. K. Dick's style is absolutely new, absolutely tuned with our days. The best is to call it, perhaps, a &quot;modern modern book&quot;.

044651506X|4.0|&quot;Plum Island&quot; is my first exposure to Nelson Demille's writing.  I enjoyed the easy flow of the book, was perfectly content to let Mr. Demille take me anywhere he wanted and yes, the main character has some chavaunistic traits but I forgave him.  The humor was..... humorous.  The connection to a real place and the geographical  references made me refer to my Atlas.  It was like, wow, there is a Plum Island, Mattituck, Cutchoge and soforth.  I knew my husband would enjoy the book and I wouldn't mind my 13 year old reading it.  As a Tom Clancy fan, I relished the brevity of &quot;Plum Island&quot; and the lack of major details but was entertained none the less.  You want to be entertained?  Read &quot;Plum Island&quot;.  I have started &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;  where the male lead certainly reminds me of Mr. Corey from P.Is. but that's OK.  Rebecca Gree

0884271536|4.0|Don't swallow the hype.  Its not gripping, its not  especially fast paced, you won't be glued to your seat.  The story is poor and the characters would kill you and me both just for a chance to get promoted to two dimensions.      BUT, what this book is very good at is teaching the theory and application of the Theory of Constraints in a conversational tone.  There's no equations and occasionally it uses pictures to make its points.  The format of a novel is a convention that allows the reader to slip through the text as if they were given in lecture style, rather than in the form of a textbook.  A much easier way to take material that can be pretty esoteric.  And the esoterica problem is handled by introducing several characters with \\"real world\\" problems that are analyzed throughout the book.  The targeted level appears to be college undergraduate or even advanced high school, which is to say it is easy reading aimed at getting the concepts across without any oddball jargon.            The point of the story is how Theory of Constraints, and other management theories such as TQM, Continuous Quality Improvement, and use of metrics can be applied with good effect to the Project Management world as well as to the Production and Manufacturing worlds.  Critical Path Method is stressed as the key tool to examining and exposing the problems that will be encountered, and the book then describes the management attitude and method changes that should be adopted to improve the overall effectiveness of a project team, and by extension, the whole organization.          This will never be a book you'll want to see made into a major Hollywood motion picture, but if you always wanted to understand and apply Theory of Constraints to your business practices, this is the painless way to sit through several lectures on the subject.  You'll walk away with a few very useful tools and a map to the larger pitfalls you'll encounter (or may already BE encountering!) on your way to strengthening your organization.     I got through it in about 14 hours easy reading, with frequent interruptions.  If its something you need, its definitely worth doing.

Complicated by his father's alcoholism and his                                                        mother's depression, the McCourt family endured inadequate housing, hunger                                                        in New York and in Ireland, They suffered preventable illness and the                                                        heartbreaking deaths of three children. What keeps the reader captivated is the                                                        humor and resilience demonstrated by the McCourts in the face of tragedy. A                                                        reminder that not all immigrants lived the American Dream and that children                                                        have always been the loosers when parents cannot get out of the trap of                                                        poverty.
0684874350|5.0|Everyone in America should chow down on a peice of this humble pie....Angela's Ashes.  Having grown up in an extremely similar situation, it gives me great honor to own a copy of this book.  Every young teen should read this book so that materialism may dissipate.  Thanks Mr. McCourt....you've given America and its immigrants a realization of the distance between wealth and poverty
0451452739|4.0|It is not the most creative work but it is certainly interesting.  I think, the movie, however, was horrible.  How would anybody who didn't read the book be able to understand the movie.  No one in a million years would be able to make the connection that the black slab that appears on Earth 3 million years ago is what gave early man the idea of using bone fragments as a mean for hunting for food.  The book is definitely 10 times better than the movie.    If anybody has a comment or anything to say of interest feel free to email me at vpatel@flinet.com
0345389409|2.0|Anne, you have proved to me that if you wait long enought, your heros will fail you. This book has nothing to do with the Vampire Chronicles. Who is Lestat and Armand in this book, certainly not the characters I know from the past books.  And also what do I care about the charater Roger. He has nothing to do with the story?! The good part of this book is Memnoch's story about God and Heaven and Hell but if I would really tell you the truth, it was trite and boring and non-developed. Anne take more time on writing books PLEASE???!!!!!. And also the endng was just pain stupid. Armand doing that. Anne dont you read your old books to keep consistenscy????? Please  People ignore this book, move on!!!!!!!
0713717068|5.0|A nice book that outlines evey step you need when constructing an electric solid body guitar. Anyone intrested in building a guitar, bass or other solid body stringed instrument should read this book, or just get it for reference. It shows you the best way to do things, yet leave it open for your own ideas. The only 'gripe' I have with the book is that it uses many terms from England. It took me a while to figure out what 'hire a router' meant. (it means rent a router) And most of the suppliers are of little or no use in the US.
0930289234|5.0|If you want to look for the best in graphic storytelling, look no further thn WATCHMEN.<br />Without a doubt, Alan Moore is THE comic book writer, and Dave Gibbons is the best at telling a story with pictures.<br />At first, the conflict and plot of the story looks simple, but then it develops with fascinating complexity.  WATCHMEN tries to explore the psychology behind superheroes: what makes these people put on a mask and go out there fighting criminals.  And it's not only a superhero story: it has elements of romance, mystery, sience-fiction, even fantasy.  But don't let the word &quot;superhero&quot; scare you , if you're one  of those people who don't like to read &quot;kiddie stuff&quot;.  I asure you this book is no kiddie stuff;<br /> it is the best fiction you can get in this or any other medium.
1573220485|4.0|Exciting and utterly absorbing, this book is a great symbol of the 90s. Drugs in Ko Samui, prostitutes in Bangkok, 20-somethings looking for peace and quiet on a deserted island, &quot;The Beach&quot; addresses my generation in a brand new way. On behalf of the kids who were raised on Tintin and Nintendo, I'd like to thank Garland for a well writ book
044651506X|5.0|After the somewhat disappointing Spencerville, I was thrilled to see DeMille return to the intrigue and suspense reminescent of The Charm School and The Talbot Odyssey.  A classic &quot;whodunit,&quot; I was surprised by the true identity of the perp as well as the motivation behind the crime.  Two thumbs up
0345315227|3.0|Clarke's prose moves with calculated efficiency, in strikingresemblance to the monolith's makers. Unfortunately, we are given thetiniest taste of what the makers have in store for the Sol system, and the story abruptly ends.  <br /> It is nice to see one view of how humankind goes about the 'mundane' business of tugging comets about, in a dance of celestial showing-off, but not enough detail was given to the answers to the questions as advertised on the back cover. <br />As a staunch supporter of Clarke, as any user of technology should be, I found no qualms with a \\"Godless\\" universe.  But in the same way Stanley Kubrick forces our eyes to be distant, I found the characters of 3001 to be adrift in a cold, calculating universe. . . with HALman as the new God.  <br /> Still, a must-read for Clarke fans worldwide
044651506X|5.0|Great book for summer.  Funny, entertaining, fast paced.  Makes you want to grab a shovel and head out to Long Island.  One of De Mille's most enjoyable, although  The Charm School  will always be my favorite
1558820108|4.0|If you already have The Avenging Saint, don't get this book.  The publisher just changed the book's name and cover.<br />You may want to read \\"The Last Hero\\" before reading this book in order to really understand the background of this story.<br />The story starts with Simon Templar returning to England to revenge the death of a friend.  Revenge isn't easy if every member of Scotland Yard is trying to arrest you for murder and other crimes.  Simon soon learns he is the only person who can stop a major European war.  Can Simon bash the villians, stop their war, and avoid arrest?  Not quite; he only manages to achieve two of these objectives.
0393038912|4.0|I love this sort of book, and it is relatively well written. See the other comments for what's good . . . here's what could be improved.<br /><br />State the conclusion early on. We have an idea where the author is headed, so there's no need to try to pull us into the book to see what the mystery is all about. Just state simply and succinctly what the conclusion is and a brief list of the primary supporting data. Then let us judge whether the book supports these.<br /><br />Don't be so repetitive -- especially toward the last five chapters.<br /><br />Don't gloss over inconsistent data that is not supportive of the theory. For instance, it isn't enough to simply write off the Alps and Carpathian Mtns as insignificant obstacles to the migration of animals, foods and ideas. At least tell us why (easily navigated passes, alternate routes, etc.)<br /><br />Finally, raise and answer (or dispose of) the obvious questions that follow upon your premise: e.g., did the geographic differences and diversity of flora and fauna effect the evolution of the peoples as well as their history?<br /><br />All of the above said, I do recommend the book

In the rare company of Abraham Lincoln and F.

0385121679|5.0|This is Stephen King's best.  Even if you're a fan, or just someone that likes to be scared, The Shining is for you.  Forget those campfire stories about the ghost with the hook, THIS is a ghost story for the ages.  Start with a malevolent hotel, add a collection of guests that won't let any thing stop them from leaving, not even death, and top it off with a crazed father chasing a psychic kid with a croquet mallet, and you've a masterpiece.   Just don't read it with the lights out.
0316926345|5.0|Each character is alive and painfully human.  The story is of Charles Ryder, who forms an intense friendship as a young college man, and whose later life was greatly affected by that earlier time, yet the years could never move him as much as those carefree days did.  <br />There were passages, phrases, in the book that moved me completely.  It is a profound and beautiful book.  The PBS miniseries was very true to the book, and is wonderful to watch as well
0446310786|5.0|Read this book and see the movie! It's too bad Harper Lee went into seclusion after she wrote this book . Dill was based on her friend, Truman Capote, I believe. Look for Robert Duvall in the movie--might have been his first movie. He had a small but important role. Everyone should read this book--such important and wonderfully evoked ideas

044651506X|5.0|Nelson DeMille was recommended to me by a gentleman in the Bangor, Me airport bookshop. He recommended The Charm School &amp; I've been hooked ever since.  Plum Island is a delicious read, with entertaining characters, a plot out of today's headlines and realistic descriptions of the North Fork area on Long Island.  You can almost feel like you are approaching Plum Island on the boat with John &amp; Co.  You feel the swells of the sea, you despise the bureacracy and many of the people who are part of our government.  That's what DeMille does so well - he make's you imagine &amp; feel.  Another note - his books do not follow the same formula ala Grisham, Ludlum et al.  Each book is unique in itself
0451163486|5.0|Die Nadel, Germany's top spy, is enjoying a peaceful stay in England.  He's looking for a little sun, a little fun...oh, and he also wants to grab hold of the Allies' plans for the D-Day invasion.  Can't forget that part!  Die Nadel, or Henry Faber (his cover name), is discovered and must flee.  He shipwrecks on a small English island, Storm Island.  There he meets Lucy and her husband David, a cripple.  Little by little, they discover the secret of their mysterious guest.    The book held me in such suspense that I dripped spittle all over it and ruined it.  That's what a wide-open mouth can do!  Have fun with it.  I did!
0553266306|4.0|The story with all its narrow escapes and cool superkiller style is very entertaining and has thusfar inspired two feature films, however, Forsyth's writing style leaves something to be desired and is not for the occasional sunday reader
0385486804|5.0|This book tells a story that needs to be told.  I thank Mr. Krakauer for bringing it to my attention.  He tells it with the skill of a novelist
015626224X|5.0|Orwell's account of the destitute life clearly reveals both his origins as a socialist and his concise, clear writing style.  In one particular chapter, he limits himself to strictly the narrative form and then in the last paragraph of two sentences, he lets loose his political analysis of the social structure with unparalleled clarity and power. I learned a few obvious truths from this book. I particularly recommend it to those on the right who have adopted Orwell as a champion of the anti-socialist cause, having read only 1984. It may open their eyes. Highly recommended
0385472951|5.0|This book rates right up there with A Time to Kill.  It is very fast paced, tense and hard to put down.  The ending, was unbelievable, I loved it!!!!  This book is full of twists and turns and an ending that will leave you shocked......a must read for any Grisham fan!!
0385311400|4.0|Once again, Diana Gabaldon has transported readers back into the rich historical background of the 18th century.  The setting has switched abruptly from Scotland in the midst of a rising to the American colonies on the brink of revolution.  With the change of setting, though, the style of this fourth book in the series has also changed.  Outlander, Dragonfly, and Voyager all had huge complex plots filled with feeling, excitement, and grandeur, and they were written with intelligence; altogether, they left me awed.  Drums, though, seems more like a novel composed of random ideas thrown together and hastily shaped into some semblance of a complete story, without the necessary links between each new idea.  Also, the characters aren't as well developed and aren't as easily likable--Brianna seems spoilt and unforgiving, Jamie overprotective and stern, without much in common with the boyish, perceptive openly-honest man he was before.  It's still written with the same humor and distinct &quot;Gabaldon voice,&quot; though, so it's anything but a flop. Just one piece of advice for prospective Outlandish readers--don't let Drums be the first book in this series that you read
0671004611|3.0|Thank you Phil for saving our country, our planet, and our species. You did a terrific job you wonderful guy you! Your name will live on. Every child will know it! Etc., Etc., Etc.This book contains a lot of techno-talk about the perported UFO crash at Roswell, N.M. in 1947. In spite of all the wonderful history lesson of technological breakthroughs of specific devices, there are no photos, x-rays, chemical or physical analysis, medical reports, or ANY details of aliens, their spaceship, or their devices. There is NO WAY that a filing cabinet, that Phil suposedly &quot;inherited&quot; could have contained abandoned military documents or artifacts or devices such as breifly described by Corso. There are NO military documents pertaining directly to a UFO crash at Roswell! Everything is heresay evidence. His understanding of science is errant in some details. The details are conspicuous by their absence!!! This book is interesting only because it reveals the oposite of what Corso wants the reader to believe; that what he is writing is true. Oh, if we did indeed have a photo, circuit diagram, chemical analysis of only the BATTERY or power source in the hand-held metal-cutting laser so often mentioned by Corso! Well, good luck reader. Why does he refer to his collection of alien stuff the &quot;nut file&quot;? (hint, hint). But it is good reading if only to pick apart this mish-mash of often repeated tech-talk nonsense. TVW
0385486804|5.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, this ingenious piece of non-fiction has the emotive and narrative impact of a novel. When I first picked it up, I thought, &quot;Why would I want to read the story of such an obvious loser like Chris McCandless?&quot; I ended up reading it in a single sitting. <br /> From the moment McCandless blasts out of Atlanta 'til his final hours in Alaska, the reader rides shotgun, never truly prepared for the next stop. Krakauer exposes some of the most forbidding and exhilarating settings America has to offer, using the McCandless story as a frame for describing and detailing landscapes that most Americans experience only as roadside blur if they experience them at all. <br /> McCandless is posthumously fortunate to have such a skillful and sensitive author tell his tale. Krakauer is establishing himself in the great American tradition of Muir, Thoreau, and Abbey. I recommend this book without reservation
0800196341|5.0|I have been fascinated by Shakespeare's &quot;Hamlet&quot; ever since I first saw a film version of it in High School back in the early 1980s. Since then, I have read the play many times and I have watched every version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; that I have been able to see.  I think that Branagh's version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; is by far the best adaptation of the play I have ever seen.  Branagh's Hamlet was witty, sarcastic, emotionally volatile and complex, and yet he was still the charismatic, intelligent and capable Prince that might have been a great King had his uncle not usurped the crown.<br />  Best of all, Branagh's &quot;Hamlet&quot; was filmed in beautiful 70mm format, with bright colors and stately sets that was a glorious contrast to the tradition of filming Hamlet with dark, brooding sets dominated by black and somber earth tones.  Branagh daringly decided to set the play in a impressionistic 19th Century setting that was reminiscent of the life-style that must have been led by the great royal houses of Europe during that era.  Branagh's decision to set the film in the 19th Century brought the action close enough to us in history that we could relate to it, but kept it far enough away that the Elizabethan language did not seem out of place.<br />  Branagh's version of the play is unique in that it is a film of the **complete** text written by Shakespeare.  However, Branagh did not simply film the existing text as written by the Bard, he brings the text to life by effectively using flashbacks and other visuals to dramatically show us details that would not be possible to show on the stage.  His effective use of flashbacks fleshes out the relationships between the characters before the main action of the play. In flashbacks, we see interaction between Claudius and Gertrude that suggests she may have unfaithful to her husband before his death.  We also see a couple of tastefully sexy scenes of Ophelia and Hamlet in bed that shows us that their relationship was indeed a passionate love affair. This makes Hamlet's brutal treatment of Ophelia during the &quot;get thee to a nunnery&quot; scene even more cruel, but, as a result, Ophelia's subsequent descent into madness makes much more sense.<br />  The full text version is almost 4 hours long, but by filming it, Branagh wisely preserves the subtleties of the play that Olivier's Academy Award-winning version eviscerated.  Olivier removed or greatly reduced many characters' lines. He completely edited out Fortinbras, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the English Ambassador, thus removing the complex political and military situation that culminates in the invasion of Elsinore by Fortinbras at the end of Act V.  Olivier also dramatically reduced the lines spoken by Gertrude and Claudius.  Claudius becomes a cardboard villain and Gertrude a vain and shallow woman.  Olivier thus converted Shakespeare's subtle and complex play about a Prince driven almost to madness by grief and indecision into a shallow play about a self-obsessed Prince who has strong Oedipal feelings for his mother.<br />  Thus, Branagh's full text version is a celebration of and an homage to the most quoted and most famous play in the English language.  Despite it's length, I was completely enthralled and entertained throughout its full, four-hour length. I think it is the finest film adaptation of a Shakespearian play ever produced.

0385472951|4.0|I thought this was a better book than many of the more recent,made for tv or movie books that Grisham has dished out.  The legal insand outs and the negotiations on all levels, including personal and public, were fascinating and educational.  The ending really didn't suprise me as much as it should have because I was expecting something to happen pages before.  However, Eva's behavior should be considered in light of the terrific ego and \\"I can outsmart anyone\\" attitude of Patrick.  How could someone that concerned with themselves get to know anyone really well?  A good read, with lots of excitement and quick action.
0385311400|2.0|Much as I love this series, this is far and away the weakest book in the saga.  Had this been the first book of Ms. G's that I read, it would have been the last.  For whatever reasons, (rush to publication, too many cooks spoiling the broth, aliens replacing the author with a duplicate) DOA is a more apt acronym than you might think.  My exact complaints are outlined by earlier customer reviews of Allchans and Reedwstle, so I won't belabor the point.  I found the book tedious, dramatically different in style than the first 3 and if it weren't the 4th of 6 books, I wouldn't have bothered to finish it.  If DOA is your first taste of the series, I beseech you to give the others a try before writing Jaime/Claire/etc off.----Now, on to casting the film, what about Liam Nielson for Jaime?  And what about his wife, Natasha Richardson, as Claire?
0804106304|5.0|This book made me focus since there were so many characters and each was important. Although I learned about the Chinese culture, being first generation American, not Chinese, I can relate to the experiences of the daughters.

0553278398|4.0|Okay, I'm really sorry about not giving this book a very good rating. But while Asimov's style never seemed dated, some of the ideas presented in _Prelude to Foundation_ are just plain silly. Such as the ridiculous shades of color worn on Imperial Trantor, or the Mycongenians who shave their entire bodies and feel hair to be socially unacceptable. Stuff you'd find in the really bad science fiction of the pulp era...but that's not the worst part. The worst part is this book's plot is so thin (quite unlike every other book in the series) that Asimov soon turns it into nothing more than a tour of Trantor and a vehicle for some of the ideas he thought would be interesting in the Imperial era. Microfarms? Well, fine. Interesting perhaps. But did he need to devote five chapters of this book to showing us inside one of them? And did he need to use the climax of those five chapters to introduce us to the concept of a book with words that scroll up the page, that oh by the way happens to be the Mycogenian holy book, on which Hari and Dors spend another five chapters that lead them both nowhere at all? But I shouldn't bash the book too much, and you probably should read it anyway, since it leads directly into _Forward the Foundation_,which I loved as much as the original books written in the 1940s. If not for Forward the Foundation, I would've given this book a six. But you can't understand _Forward..._ without this, so read them both in the order they were published (which is actually what you should do for the whole series-read this after Foundation's Edge). You'll be glad about it, if not just for how great Forward the Foundation is
0060920386|4.0|A good read for a complete novice on the world of Wall Street and corporate America.  We benefit from the indepth research of the authors, clearly close to their subject, and, from their good journalism, as they know how to tell a story without losing the layman.  My subtitle for the book would be 'all I ever needed to know about LBOs'  -- the RJR Nabisco buyout is an excellent case study.  There's little too much extraneous detail on the characters -- it's distracting -- but perhaps that's an effort to give them some depth.  Indeed, it's a pity that many of the main protagonists are so reprehensible -- I found it hard to empathise with any of the characters.  And the story does leave the reader with a sense of disillusion on two points: the sheer waste of money and resources squandered for the sake of egos; and clearly, contacts (especially amongst the 'jocks') are as, if not more, important than diligence, competance or intelligence
0812550706|4.0|The hype regarding this novel and the subsequent praise it's generated have both got _way_ out of hand. This book is perhaps even more overated than Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series. People say Jordan's better than Tolkien, but here people are saying this is the best book ever written. I liked it, but it's hardly up to that status. Keep in mind that this novel was written mostly A) to introduce Ender to Card's outline for Speaker for the Dead, B)to stop the comments by some parties that Card was championing the obliteration of an alien race (as it quite seemed he was in the original novella) and C) to introduce Card's concept of the Battle Room. How it came to involve Card's ideas about the Warsaw Pact and the Internet I don't know, but those subplots do keep the story from further becoming standard issue military SF.<br />What I believe draws readers to this books and makes them love it so is the narrative.I don't know what it is, but Card's descriptions of the book's scenes work wonders in terms of painting a picture.His minimal descriptions of the Battle School's claustrophobic hub as well as the rest of the story's locales and people allow one to visualize everything without being forced by the author to change what it might look like to that particular reader. That's one of Card's strength, describing the situation without describing the concrete looks of the situation. A hard thing to master, and a skill more writers should try their hand at. <br /> But some holes in the plot remain-why, after the near destruction of humanity, would the government allow parents to have only two children?Dosen't make sence. And why was Ender's army allowed to cheat by using the cable line in one of their battles? And why let the kids use so many tecniques that clearly use the walls as an advantage, when it was made perfectly clear that the only function of the walls in the battle room was to keep kids from careening into space Frank Poole-style (obviously there aren't wallsin space)? And while I can sort of believe a 6 year old could be as smart as Ender, it's hard to believe there would be enough of them to fill a giant battle school. But still, I liked the book, and finished the series. The other books I'd give nines, because they had original plots. Ender's game steals from _Starship Troopers_, among others, and still succeeds because of elements of psychology and strategy as well as ideas about the internet and politics

0671004611|5.0|I really like this book.  But before I praise I will critisize it.  My first concern is why a patriot would break the silence?  That needs to be explained before I give it a 10.  Second:  I wish there would have been some sort of document that would at least hint at a coverup.  This book is great, if not for the ufo part then for the information Corso talks about the Cold war and just how dangerous it really was.  About half of the book discusses the dangers the KGB forced on us and how much they infiltrated the CIA.  He also goes on to talk about how the military fully distrusted the CIA for this reason.  Another aspect of this book is how all the technology he helped advance through the ship was already being developed.  In other words this ship didn't bring about all of our modern technology it hastened it introduction.    The first paragraph I wrote discusses my worries of this book.  The reasons that I tend ot believe in this starts with Strom Thurmand's forward.  If Thurmand wrote this forward not knowing the true reason then we can expect a lawsuit soon.  But I think thats unlikely.  I think thurmand knew why he was writing it and I glad he did because it adds a new glitch to the skeptic's point of view.  Why would a very respectible Senator, that has been able to retain office for decades, write a forward to such an outlandish book?  Also, Corso's  desciptions of other projects are very detailed in there acuracy of overall events.  One must realize that a man who is working with so many projects will not be able to retain any true detailed tech. specs. at that time and not 30 years later.  I hope more comes out of this.  Unlike some people I want to know more

His uncanny use of growing voices, from a child of three to a young man of nineteen, is refreshing.  A page turner to the end.  As a library director, I urge you to buy this book rather than borrow it from the library.  It's a keeper. Tobi Liedes-Bell (tliedesbell@wyld.state.us.wy
0385312083|5.0|What can one say about &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; that hasn't already been analyzed to death before?  Suffice to say, there is a reason this book is seen as a classic: its portrayal of the coldness of war, its time-warping style, Vonnegut's dark humor at an all-time cutting edge...  If you have not been forced to read this book in a class, force yourself.  If Vonnegut is remembered for one masterpiece, this will be it
0440111498|5.0|The end of the world as seen through Vonnegut's eyes and yours as you will read and re-read this book for years to come.  The Grateful Dead took icenine as the name of their music publishing company.  I have read all of Vonnegut's works and still come back to Cat's Cradle every few years, enjoying it more each time
0440117658|4.0|After several letdown novels and &quot;autobiographical collages&quot; in the late seventies, &quot;Deadeye Dick&quot; was a blast of fresh air.  A dark comedy involving one Rudy Waltz who accidentally shoots a pregnant woman, killing her and her child, when he points his gun out his window and fires for the sake of it.  The book deals with one wild thing after another, and pokes fun at the darker side of nuclear bombs, Hitler's art, gourmet cooking, and public atrocity exhibitions of prisoners.  A wild romp and one of the few later books that is a must for Vonnegut fans
0876852630|3.0|Bukow does have the ability to call upon his Bad-tempered drunken whore of a Muse and give us that middle-fingered prose that makes up his vintage works (esp. Ham On Rye &amp; Women). Factotum is the bare bones of Bukow. It is his anger, his poverty, his screw-fests, fist-fights and booze without the Muse. It's documentary play by play versus inspired storytelling. Factotum (&amp; Post Office for that matter) is Bukow's brain recovering from his stint in the mad house trying to make sense of his life through words. Ham On Rye and Women are works where he has his proverbial shit together. The greater works are those where the documentary of a Drunk is elevated to that plane of alcoholic clarity, replacing Nihilisim with true Bukow character, superior surliness and &quot;i'll shit in my pants if I want to&quot; heroism. Yet, while Factotum may be crude in comparison to his other novels, it is still the brass tactics of the crappy boy Bukow we know so well. However, don't say I didn't warn you, Factotum is a stale beer compared to the whiskified prose and grander, double D yarn spinning going on in Ham On Rye, Hot Water Music and Women
0440111498|4.0|Far be it from me to imply that &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is not a good time.  But for some reason it has come to sit in Vonnegut's pantheon next to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House.&quot;  And again, it's not that it doesn't work; the odd little tale of island romance in the midst of revolution and the ultimate freezing element, ice-9 has plenty of terrific moments.  But ultimately, the book feels cold and clammy; where elsewhere Vonnegut contrasts the sad and the funny here he chooses to club you with pathos and neglect to explain much of anything.  Overall, a good read, but check out &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot; or most of his other early novels before shipwrecking here
0385486804|4.0|Krakouer is an astronomer who has saved a little known star from obscurity. The Great Ones are of course those who lived to tell the tale. They are Mellville and London and Hemingway. Adventurers will never die. But who is to say that the small victories or defeats in life are any less sublime than the Great conflicts and conquerings. Moby Dick and Call of the Wild, Into the Wild is not. It is about someone who was moved by the Great Spirit of Adventure. It is about someone who failed to survive the journey, but the chronicle of his attempt is worthy if for no other reason than to remind those of us with Nomad souls that the attempt must be made! Courage is the attempt, but behold! one must, we learn from Krakouer, not proceed without humility and wisdom, which aids survival so the attempt may be relished and  pondered. Adventurers who die adventuring perish in their Labor of Love, and this is not necessarily a bad or tragic thing as the Bourgiouse multitudes would have us believe. But, as Krakouer lets us see thorugh his commentary, the rewards of surviving the quest are almost as great as undertaking the quest itself
0440131480|4.0|&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; was Vonnegut's true follow-up to &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot; and brought a big sigh of relief to those confused by &quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot; and &quot;Between Time and Timbuktoo.&quot;  It is Kilgore Trout's show here, and fans will find Vonnegut's principal character in rare form as he journeys to a celebration in his honor, spurred on by his one reader, the famous Eliot Rosewater.  There is also another story about a used car salesman losing his mind and wreaking havoc on the good times.  <br />  Of course, the novel is probably most famous for a character that comes in late in the novel, one Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.  Here, Vonnegut does his best Pirendello and confronts his world head on.  An interesting and often hysterical time; its just too bad that much of the early part of the book is tedious.  If you can hold on until the book gets rolling, you'll have the ride of your life.
0312853238|5.0|This is the best book in 20th century American literature, with the possible exception of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, for looking through a precocious child's eyes.  I was given the book in high school, by an English teacher, and have since passed it on to dozens of my friends.  While the technical aspects of Card's sci-fi may be questionable, the psychology is brilliant.  How many gifted children have ever felt as though they were being forced to perform tricks, like animals on display, while knowing that the adults in control only had their position due to their age?  How much would such children relish the idea that through the anonymous Internet, they could take over the world?  That the adult puppeteers could be destroying their souls by using their talents for the wrong ends? I cannot say enough about this book.  I have read it and reread it.  I purchased it in French merely so that the effort of translation would enable me to relish the words one more time.  It would be worth improving my Russian, or taking up Spanish, just to be able to read it again and savor it as I did the first time
0679457313|5.0|beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, and beautiful!even the best of writers has one eye, one vision that they pull andstretch and pummel and shape into a story: and sometimes it's fun to read. A.R. has ten thousand eyes, all closing and opening and turning and winking and seeing, seeing, seeing. so many eyes, so much vision, all contained and bursting out of such an unpretentious book. prepare to be left reeling, positively reeling, at the end.
0440111498|5.0|Reading the other reveiws here is beginning to give me the feeling that many of these people aren't reading the same book that I have read numerous times.  &quot;Cat's Cradle&quot; is quinteissential Vonnegut.  He blends humor (Admittedly not as much so as his other novels)with his trademark apocalyptic visions of doom.  This book is as hard edged as any of the satire he spilled out in his other novels.  This book ranks in his top three and is far better than Bluebeard or Hocus Pocus (Don't get me wrong, those two are great as well.) But if you can say that this is not one of his better works than you simply weren't smart enough to grasp it.  It's nothing short of pure genious
0671004611|4.0|An interesting book indeed, but as the old lady used to say, &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;  Indeed Corso's credentials seem squeaky clean, but the question that he never answers is &quot;Why are you telling us now?&quot; With so many references to intimidation by the Army to the witnesses and to people in the know over the last 50 years why can he divulge the unthinkable now?  He touches on so many other interesting topics but never delves into them; The Kennedy Assassination, other crashes, communicating with the aliens, and secret bases. His narration never goes deep enough.  Anyway it is the most interesting book about Roswell that I have seen in years, and if what he is saying is true Superman can step out of the way for Col. Corso

Any player, from beginner to advanced, can greatly benefit from the techniques that Tim Gallwey has introduced in this outstanding work.  With his inner game techniques, Tim has discovered the absolute key to successful golf.  However, the effectiveness of Tim's techniques is not limited to the game of golf.  His techniques can be aplied to any area of life resulting in dramatic improvement whether it be on the playing field, at home or in the office.

0374266425|3.0|Sure, this is a good introduction to the philosophical history, and baking it into a novel makes it more available. But still, the prose in this novel is not good, its banal and cheap, it rides on a great idea which is not given a chance to blossom, you could do much more out of this, the pathetic plot destroys the experience, and furthermore its written in a language suited fo children or young teenagers, but on the other hand, maybe thats who its written for and thats the reason I dont apreciate it...oh well, but still, its not a waste of time, its worth reading..
0684874350|5.0|This heartwarming and sadly accurate tale of life in Ireland will not only make you cry...but will hold you, make you laugh, cheer you up...and uplift your spirit! McCourt's story of the hardships and sweet sadness experienced in his youth has inspired a greater sense of appreciation in this first generation Irish twenty-something's consciousness
0385472951|4.0|I would still rank A Time to Kill and The Firm higher as far asthe Grisham books but this one is on par with The Runaway Jury and TheRainmaker.  John still has a problem finishing what he has started but in this case part of my disappointment is that I wanted a different ending for the protagonist which means I was wrapped up in this novel.
0671004611|5.0|Col. Corso's book is an excellent read and a fascinating insight into how the government/military &quot;secrecy machine&quot; works.  I almost felt sick to my stomach at times when reading about how our government decieves it's citizens.  The man who wrote this book can only be described as a patriot, spilling the beans on what should have been public information 50 years ago
0783811950|5.0|Tired of our society?  This book takes us back to the importance of our dreams which have gotten sidetracked in this crazy world.  Paulo Coelho reminds us of the meaning of being ALIVE, what it means to really FEEL, and how to make our hearts sing.  Dissatisfied with the rat race?  Tired of being a yuppie?  Thought life would be more rewarding by now?  This seemingly simple fable may give you the courage to break free
0671004611|5.0|I loved this book. Col. Corso covers so many different aspects of technology. Most importantly his mention of Canadians Dr Gerald Bull (V3 supergun expert)and Wilbur Smith is in exact correspondence with published information in Canada. In a recent book &quot;The UFO Files&quot; by Palimaro Campagna, the unclassified papers of Wilbur Smith were discussed. Smith was sent to the US by the Canadian Govt. to discuss the UFO phenomena. Col. Corso accurately describes this
0394586077|5.0|I recomend that all fantasy lovers should read this book. Espicially 5th through 8th graders even though it is a good book for all ages over 10. It features a group of companions including a happy-go-lucky kender,a grumbling dwarf,a weird mage,two babarians(male and female),a proud and loyal knight,a giantman who is very protective of his mage brother who is very weak,and a half-elf who is their leader. This book will take you a the wildest, funniest, fantasy journey of your life
0140072187|5.0|This book is first book recommended by my Father for me to read on Vietnam.  He was there twice (66 and 71), and rarely talks of his experiences.  This book led to our (Mom, Dad, and myself) visit to Vietnam in 1995.  Once started, it cannot be put down
0449911357|5.0|I've seen the movie and loved it, so when I saw the book I was really excited and decided to buy it. It was wonderful it was a great book from beginning to end. I wish that I could find another book as good as this, but I doubt I'll be able to. If you've seen the movie, it's similar to the movie, but like most movies it's a little different. It's worth the money it takes to buy it
0441003257|5.0|<br />This book is histerical.  As a previous fan of Neil Gaiman, I can say he did not let me down one bit. He took the coming end of the world, prophesy, and religion and added a wonderful twist.  I like to compare the style of writing almost to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,another wonderful series.   This book will make you think and let you laugh histerically as well
1563523302|5.0|This book was a common sense approach and reminder that if we want to get ahead in the world today, we need to live within or below our means.  So many people are concerned about how wealthly they appear, that they do not have any actual wealth.   For me it was a good reminder that there is no need to &quot;keep up with the Joneses.&quot;  Really enjoyed the book
0451191153|5.0|This book was indeed good, moving at least. However, there are points which I thought were montonous, unnecessary. There is a LONG speech given by the main character, Howard Roark, at the end of the book, mainly to consitute Rand's Ode To Objectivism. I mean, it was really long. If you want to learn Ojectivism, read any of the articles in Philosophy, Who Needs It. I also heard from a friend that there is an even longer speech, almost 50 pages, given by the main character in Atlas Shrugged. I don't think she had, at the point she wrote The Fountainhead, crafted her literary fiction skills perfectly yet.       As far as the philosophy presented in the book, it's rather straightforward and logical: you are fooled by your emotions, and it's an essential to moral survival to observe all things objectively, and to interpret your perceptions both rationally and logically. However, aside from the philosophical interpretation of the world, I disagree with Rand's political viewpoints, for reasons I won't enumerate here, simply to save space and to avoid putting you to sleep. In short, I think her epistemological and metaphysical philosophy contradicts her political.       The major downfall I see in Objectivism, demonstrated most clearly, is that it is a very dogmatic philosophy. Howard Roark's behavior seems logical, but it only goes to show how a real, stoic Objectivist behaves in an esoteric manner, holding their infallible logic aloof from all other 'common people'. With this I disagree, and again, I will not explacate here.       Overall, I give The Fountainhead two thumbs up, simply because it champions logic and reason, and those are two virtues that are entirely too scarce in the modern world. Also, being an aspiring architect, I had a great appreciation for the dominant theme chosen as the vehicle to deliver her message. It is a long book, but is one which you can move through at a good pace, if you understand the basic tenets of Objectivism and don't have a hard time with vocabulary.
0684874350|5.0|This is not just an &quot;Irish&quot; story. It is more an American tale. As the land of immigrants, America's true pedigree is closer to Angela and her family than we are likely to admit. Why else would &quot;they&quot; (we) come here..still?!Being Irish American it was, at times, difficult to face the circumstances that gave rise to the sterotypes that I had (and still to this day have) to face down. Yet what I found refreshing was a child-like renewal of the feeling that we all are the same after all. It is a must read for all
0393038912|3.0|July 8, 1997  Guns, Germs and Steel  by  Jared Diamond    At least I bought the book from AMAZON !  I give it a well-deserved 5/10.    The 5 is for the excellent writing and the breathtaking scholarship. I give Jared Diamond a U for analysis and idealogical cant . Starting from a promising and evocative premise   Mr. Diamond ends with a load of scholarly fudge so tainted by current fashionable thinking that  his great enterprise is very much diminished.    &quot;How is it that you white people have developed all this cargo and brought it to New Guinea and we black people have no cargo ?&quot;  The question is seminal. You have more than enough for yourselves and can bring it here and almost give it away; and we have none. Good cheap fish hooks; transistor radios, with batteries; small reliable electric generators; outboard motors that can pull against the fastest-rushing river currets; beautiful rifles that can bring down game at 300 meters; satellite television;   --- cargo, cargo, cargo.       Diamond doesn't see the poignancy of the question, he's too busy trying to show his humanity, political correctness and he is on his knees begging for forgiveness from our very insightful Yali. In this case at least, I agree with the author, this New Guinean has more intelligence than at least one Western academic.    Pizzaro was a bad boy. Pestilential vectors operating through close living with animals gave immunity to infection. Colonial loathsomeness. What has this got to do with cargo ?    Yali knows the truth: some civilizations are indeed better than others. Some are indeed more humane and more productive and allow more freedom for human development than others and only an intellectual caught in the web of his own nitpicking could believe otherwise. I do not doubt the innate intelligence of people everywhere, but tick-tack-ticking on a keyboard by a computer operator is several orders of magnitude from the accretion of science and multi-layered technologies that brought Western civilization from Euclid and Archimedes to a 4-million device computer chip.    But, but, you say, old Ed Wilson says its a good book. The great Paul Ehrlich the grandaddy of population studies, writes an approving note. As the old adage has it &quot;I'll write a blurb for your book but please don't make me read it.&quot;    Look, I don't want be mean about this but it seems the only way we can reform this kind of wrongheadedness is by refusing to participate. Take your mate to the driving range and shoot a pail of balls. Have dinner out at MacDonalds on me. Save your money in an S&amp;P Index based fund (currently paying 29%). This book was a shrewdly designed marketing plan by WWNorton: with the proliferation of multicultural courses in America's universities, there's almost a built-in sale of about 20,000 books and that will pay for the costs of production and then some. The rest is gravey.
0553293397|5.0|I LOVE science fiction! Asimov has it in this book. It makes you think!
0393314804|5.0|Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting is seen as two things, depending who you ask.  Anyone over 30 will say it is a controversial cult novel.  Any one from Gen X will tell you it is a guide to well-being.  Wheither you find it down right smut or holier than thou, godly material, you'll always find it interesting.  The motion picture screen doesTrainspotting little justice because the contents that make this the &quot;feel nothing&quot; book of the era, also ban the true feel of the novel from any screen.  And that my friends is a shame, because so few bask in the glory of literature anymore.  This is, in my opinion, the best book in history since the Bible, maybe better
044651506X|2.0|I have read most of Mr. Demille's works and totally enjoyed GOLD COAST and THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER.  PLUM ISLAND is a disaster!  It seems as if the author is trying to create a &quot;gum shoe&quot; of the 40's and 50's but fails dismally.  John Corey, the NYPD detective, is all smart mouth.  For pages on pages on pages, NOTHING HAPPENS.  Then, maybe, a clue.  All of a sudden, this smart mouth becomes the greatest detective on earth.  Too much talk and smart remarks and too little action and plot.  If Demille is tyring to make John Corey the &quot;gum shoe&quot; of the 90's, I'm not buying
0441172717|5.0|Can I say more than what already has been said about this book? Dune is easily the most enthralling book I have ever read. Frank Herbert has managed to comment on many of our greatest worries (e.g. energy, religion, drugs), weaving them into a tapestry of interstellar proportions. The work takes place in the far future, where the politics of an entire universe is dependent upon a drug (Melange) which can be mined on only one planet: the desert Dune. Plot twists and intrigue abound in this greatest of Herbert's works. One small detail: if you read this work, be sure that you will read each of it's sequels (and there are five). Still, this is as pleasing of a punishment as you ever will receive, so take the risk!!
044651506X|5.0|Enough has been said in the prior reviews to satisfy even the slightly curious. I've read every Demille book published, yet this one was still a 2:00 am, I've got to go to sleep, but I can't-put-it-down kind of book.  One criticism (If you're listening Mr. Demille) is that Boston Whalers don't sink
0380973634|4.0|It seems that there are at least two Neil Gaimans wandering around in the world. The Gaiman who wrote the Sandman series (among other graphic novels) - a dark, philisophical, and profoundly detailed version - and the Gaiman who writes books in a manor that causes a constant ring of Douglas Adams and Oscar Wilde. <br /> Not that this is a bad book in any way. It is entertaining, interesting, and generally great fun to read. Still, it's not the Neil Gaiman that Sandman alumni may expect; it is as if escaping to a pure text medium lifts his spirits.  <br />  The story - a average (or slightly below) man falls between the cracks to London Below and has adventures - is fun to read. The main character is easy to identify with, especially for anyone who has ever been completely out of their element. Still, the ending was far too &quot;made for television&quot;; I predicted it chapters ahead of time.  <br />  Not a 10, but definately worthwhile.
0449227421|1.0|I am incredulous that the author of Pillars of the Earth could turn out a book like The Third Twin.  My most damning criticism of this novel is that it is NOT smart.  Full of factual errors, gaping plot holes and an abundance of handy coincidences to carry along the action, it does appear to be a plot for a made-for-TV movie.  My favorite howler in this book is the black WWII veteran neighbor (really knows how to throw in those cliches, doesn't he?)stating that he stole a pistol from a German soldier because black soldiers were not allowed to carry weapons (huh?).  All in all, a waste of leisure time
0385472951|4.0|The Partner let us know what happened to the hero of TheFirm. I liked that. He seemed to run out of steam at the end; closedso suddenly I was shocked. However, the book was written cleanly, fairly and was what we wanted - a good yarn. John has evidently made the decision to support his family by turning out novels which sell well and have a following. There is nothing wrong with that. His style is entrancing, his characters likable, his plots thrilling and he doesn't split his infinitives. What more can you ask? The fact that John's style is recognizable is not a detraction - one feels comfortable with him. How pleasant to look forward to a new John Grisham each May! Keep 'em coming, John - they criticized Dickens too.
0688152023|5.0|Beautiful stark black and white photographs grace the pages of this remarkable book, showing correct form for the exercises and offering a glimpse into the lifestyle of a dancer.  The text is written in such a way that even the most ballet-illiterate reader would soon recognise the terms &quot;first position,&quot; &quot;plie,&quot; and &quot;tendu.&quot;  Peter Martins is an exceptionally competant man who deserves great credit for this work of visual and intellectual art
0345315227|1.0|Has ACC, the greatest SF writer in history forgotten how to develop characters.  Most of the main characters in the book - Chandler, Khan, Indra showed such promise, but were simply cast out before they even became interesting. This book is so full of \\"non-answers\\" that ACC needs to write another book (3002 maybe)to fix all the problems (maybe Gentry Lee should help this time.)  I felt like whole chapters were missing. <br /> The \\"climax\\" of 3001, if you call it that, was so weak that it makes you think ACC wanted you to get through it fast so he could pat himself on the back for the  last twenty pages. <br /> And, did I miss something, or didn't Bowman mention something about a higher power than the Monoliths.  ACC threw this out and then blew it off like everything else, like further explaining the Monoliths.  They are certainly more than just a Super-computer. <br /> Also, wouldn't Poole have even tried to find out what happened to his family, friends, etc. a thousand years back (Yea, I know info. was lost, but you gotta try) <br /> When an author apologizes for a book before it starts and after its finished, you know there are problems.  I hope ACC straightens this out. It certainly does not end the mystery. <br />
0345315227|2.0|While I read all the Sci-Fi giants as a teenager, Clarke was myfavorite.  His early collections were some of the best Sci-Fi everdone.  So it was a great disappointment reading 3001, to see how far he has fallen.  3001 seemed to be vehicle for Clarke to trot all of his \\"inventions\\", such as the space elevator/orbital ring, exploration of the solar system, and various colonies throughout the solar system. I did like the bringing back of Frank Poole, but having the artifact of a race a million years ahead of laid low by a computer virus? Preposterous!  The book was at best anticlimatic, almost none of the big questions were answered.  Sad.
1563523302|4.0|A wise man once said, &quot;If you want to be wealthy, you need to study wealth.&quot;  That is exactly what  best-selling authors, Stanley and Danko, have done for the last twenty years.   I would like to congratulate these two authors for their clear and entertaining way of presenting their findings.  The message they share in their book The Millionaire Next Door is one of hope and homey wisdom:  the 3,500,000 millionaire households in the US have certain common traits, and you can learn the &quot;secrets&quot; that they live by if you desire personal wealth.     What is notable is what didn't make the list of traits.  Expensive clothes, flashy cars, or high-consumption lifestyles are not the domain of the typical millionaire; they are more characteristic of the chronically over-extended!  A key distinction in this book is the difference between income and wealth.  Even people with a modest income, by following prudent principles, can enjoy great wealth over time.  On the other hand, top income-earners often spend their money as fast as they earn it, leaving them with few accumulated assets over the years.  This insight is particularly useful to young couples like my husband and I.   It is very comforting to know that one is really able to become financially independent and hence free in every sense of the word in this country.    A few puzzling things though: 1) I wonder about the totally neglected mention of the ethnic Chinese( or any other Asian group for that matter)successes in the book.  This calls into question the thoroughness of their research.  2) I was expecting an insighful elaboration of two of the denominators mentioned, ie, &quot;They are proficient in targeting market opportunities&quot; and &quot;They chose the right occupation.&quot;  The authors didn't really do justice to their assertions. 3) I  cannot but help wonder about the quality of life these ordinary millionaires have. While it is a great feeling to have much financial surplus, are theygenerally happy folks who have used their best potential in life.  Are they like Andrew Carnegie who devoted much of his life accumulating wealth and then spent the rest GIVING IT AWAY happily?

0812550757|5.0|After reading Enders Game I had high expectations of Speaker for the Dead.  I enjoyed the book but found it to be quite different from Card's first in the series.  There is not as much action and more philosophy.  If you read for intrigue, irony, and plot you will greatly enjoy this novel.  If you like lots of action, you may be disappointed.  It is definitely worth reading for the sophisticated SF reader

0671721720|5.0|Weber's second saga of Honor Harrington is a fitting follow-up to Basilisk Station.  After reading only the first two books in this series I'm hooked on Honor.  She is a  top-notch character: very likeable, highly capable, yet vulnerable.  One of the unique features of Weber's stories is a more detailed and more believable rationale for high-speed combat between space-ships.  Unlike most authors, he concerns himself with such things as speed, distance, acceleration, and detection of other ships and how these affect tactics and manuevering.  I haven't checked his math, but it all sounds plausible.  My only gripe with Weber so far is that, like Jerry Pournelle, he has a &quot;thing&quot; for monarchy.  Being a died-in-the-wool democrat and republican (both with lower-case letters) all this bowing and scraping to someone's son and heir sometimes rankles, but so far he has made the baddies, the People's Republic of Haven (the ultimate wellfare state) sound repulsive enough to keep me rooting for the Stellar Kingdom of Manticore.  (Weber's universe in these books is a human-dominated one.  There are a few sentient aliens, but none with space-faring technology so far.
0679735909|5.0|I had come back to work after a week's vacation in Cape Cod, mostly spent on a patio reading, when my boss came in to chat.  (Unusual; he's a nice guy but not keen on chatting about non-work matters)  Talk turned to books.  I told him about what I read on vacation and then he asked what my favorite book was.  &quot;Possession by A.S. Byatt&quot;, I answered.  &quot;It takes a while to get into, and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why I was continuing to read it.  Maybe because it won the Booker Prize, I just wasn't sure.  But once I reached the letters discovered by the two researchers, it became a page-turner.  I was straining to read it in the dark when the train I was on went into a tunnel, because I simply could not put it down.  Definitely the most satisfying reading experience of my life&quot;.  My boss had similar feelings (although not about reading it while a train went into a tunnel).  He recalled a lengthy passage where every single type of flower in a field is described.  Enough already, he wanted to say, I understand!!  But then he later realized, he had a perfect, vivid picture in his mind's eye of that field of flowers.  I guarantee that, after reading this book, you will be left with your own version of my boss' field of flowers in your mind's eye
0671004611|5.0|Absolutely Mind Numbing!  I couldn't put it down. I would have given the book a rating of ten if there had been more copies of memo's and supporting documents, photographs of UFO's, etc.    In my estimation, since Colonel Corso was a young officer at Fort Riley in 1947, he must be near the age of 75 by now.  I believe, like Major Jesse Marcel, he simply wanted to let the world in on what he knew before he passed away and the truth was possibly forever buried with him.      I found it rather strange that the Air Force decided to publish their book &quot;Case Closed&quot; just prior to the release of Colonel Corso's book.  Was this just another attempt to turn everyone's attention away from the truth?    A great read for anyone interested in ufology.
0679457313|4.0|The God of Small Things is, more than anything else, anexquisitely crafted book.  Like a painter, Roy has painted in the tinydetails and rich language that make it a pleasure to read.  Despite having no linear structure, the book is still coherent and one ends with a feeling of having gone full circle.  The young Estha and Rahel and their relationship to everyone and everything around them are wonderfully real.  The lingustic innovations work in evoking an authentic 'child language'.  Roy also sticks faithfully to Kerala, not trying to oversimplify its complexities. Certain episodes are however, clumsily written, like the sexual abuse of Estha by the OrangeDrinkLemonDrink Man, almost as if the obligatory child sex abuse scene had to be inserted.  The older Estha and Rahel were, for me, completely unconvincing, their potentially explosive meeting after so many years is trite and stilted.  In fact, it is fortunate that most of the novel is set in the past.  It is almost as if the author has set up this wonderful story of a family falling apart (Ammu putting little Estha on the train is heartbreaking) and then doesn't know what to do with the adult brother and sister when they meet. Though the author protests that she wasn't thinking of an audience when she wrote (see her interview in amazon.com--why do authors have to pretend they are always in the throes of creative fervour and never think about things like dollar royalties and advances?) this is quite obviously written for a Western audience (why publish in New York otherwise?). That is why I think that while I as an Indian could identify with the children and with all the grown-ups around them, I found the grown up Rahel so unconvincing. I could not imagine too many Indian women living in jeans, studying for 'undergraduate' degrees (it is 'graduate' and 'post graduate', not undergraduate and graduate in India), marrying Americans on impulse and (another fashionable obligatory thing) getting divorced and drifting around-- 'alienated', unable to communicate with the people who brought them up. The older Estha is almost a caricature.  Something about these young Indian authors writing in English makes them evoke India wonderfully well, but they never manage to get into the skin of young adult Indians without falling into the mush of alienation, rootlessness and other fashionable claptrap. Those looking for a powerful larger vision will not find it in this book, this is definitely a well written book about the SMALL things.ound-- 'alienated', unable to communicate with the people who brought them up.

It is a nice book for someone with no background in philosophy, especially a high school student, but if you have a grasp of the basics this back will provide little extra.  As a novel, it is an utter dissapointment, intellectually unchallenging and well yes silly.  If you already know a little about philosophy, look elsewhere

0440211727|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read, and not just because it has a good script, but because of the way it is written.  Grisham kept me on the edge of my seat, and flippin the pages, I absolutely could not put it down, and if by chance I had to eat or sleep it would knaw on my brain till I picked it up again.     When I would hear Jake Brigance arguing with Rufus Buckley at times I would laugh out loud, and when the case looked doubtfull, I was in low spirits almost depressed that day, and I don't even remember a book ever having an efect like that on me before, this is a masterpeice of reading, and I garuntee to anyone that reads this that if they do they will not be sorry, and will have NO regrets what so ever.

0812550706|4.0|If you identify with Ender--a lonely, tough, murderous-yet-sweet-and-innocent hyper-genius child prodigy--you'll love this book. You may also love this book if you like imagining the intricate details of blood-sport events. Beyond that, there isn't much here: a stock plot (executed with grace and precision, but only a couple barely-interesting twists), and precious few sci-fi ideas. Personally, though, I did identify with Ender and found this book very compelling and entertaining
0684874350|5.0|One of the best books of the century, if not of all time. This is the book conveying the reality of poverty, without dehumanizing or patronizing the poor. The author lived it and you will relive it, along with tragedy so be prepared for the first harrowing third of the book. After this point the child Frank begins to recover the humour in life. I constantly laughed out loud in public while reading. Be warned that you too shall become an Angela's Ashes evangelist
067942850X|3.0|Krakauer has effectively reconstructed the tragic tale of Chris McCandless' naive and fatal plunge into the Alaska winderness in search of his young man's need for a purpose.  Death is often the catalyst of couriosity and this book does not dissapoint in it's complete analysis of when, how and possibly why McCandless died.  Everyday young men and women set out on similar quests for understanding in unforgiving rural and urban windernesses.  Most live to tell about it.  Some, like McCandless, don't. <br /> 207 pages is quite long for this story that could have been told effectively in a series of magazine articles or as part of a collection of shorter writings. I would hope that McCandless's tragedy will serve as a guiding light for others who seek &quot;the meaning of life&quot; and those who think they are ready to tackle life on the road and/or the true wilderness.

It is a mystery that the reader will never solve without the help of  Ms. Christie--even though all the clues are given.

0679457313|4.0|I am a senior lecturer in Psychology in the townof Kottayam,near Aymenam,Kerala, the backgroundscenario of the &quot;God of Small Things&quot; The story made me cry,laugh,enjoy and appreciate. Arundhati delves into the inner workings of the human psyche of the each character in the story. I felt sad about Ammu, at the same time happy about her small life joys.  The small things made Estha and Rahel happy.  Velutha though an untouchable , touches all of us very intimately.  The literary style and the author uses is the pace of the novel is amazing. The story flows like the river Meenachil, with no time bounds or cultural limits It uncovers a great deal about the small things about our existence in this big cosmos. I recommend this book to all the readers in the West and East.
0380713802|3.0|This book was a good read.  I felt as if I shared in Bryson's romp around Europe retracing his teenage interrail trip of the early 70's.  I also felt that he had many incisive comments and insights.  I laughed out loud on the subway at the many scenes that were so hilariously described.  Bryson has succeeded in taking the bar-room story into  book form  where he is the teller.  Unfortunately, the book does suffer from its on superficiality.  By the turn of the last few pages, were Bryson says: &quot;I sat trapped.. listening to my idly prattling mind and wished that I could just get up and walk out on myself&quot;?  One  realizes that throughout the book, Bryson has never genuinely interacted with the people on his trip. He sees the characters he meets as pawns for his cultural comments and one-liners. He travels with the air of superiority that is a legacy of the Baedecker days where &quot;foreigners&quot; (i.e. the locals) are reduced to servents and characters in a play. The country and culture becomes a stage, all performed for the sojourner's benefit where the entrance fee  is reserved seat on a train purchased by AmEx. I enjoyed the book, but Bryson's open embrace for this form of whirlwind-travel leaves it a bit empty in the end.

0345403959|5.0|I've loved Eddings' writing for years, so I greeted the arrival of this book with utter glee. It certainly didn't disappoint, either.  It rehashed some parts, yes.  But these parts were either so exciting I didn't mind, went into greater detail, or showed events from a whole new perspective ( Belgarath's slightly amoral but funny view, as opposed to Polgara's outraged understanding of events, or more often, Garion's befuddled and innocent take.)  I understood, for the first time, the origins of beliefs, traditions, and anger-filled rivalries in this wonderful universe of David Eddings.  I'd say it's a great read for those just getting into the series, old fans who want to return, or anyone who likes good, old-fashioned fantasy
0679731377|4.0|A true rarity.  Constructed of eleven independent sections or &quot;chapters&quot; (the half-chapter is one of the most thought provoking essays I have ever read), the book defies classification--it is not a novel with a characters functioning in a linear plot, yet the repeated motifs and themes that link the work make it much more than a collection of short stories.  Through this method Barnes subverts the conventions we use to characterize literature while brilliantly tweaking the noses of religion and love.  In the process the reader must confront both highly personal and academic questions.  An excellent example of post-modernism done right.<br /><br />Is it a good read?  For the most part yes.  The first two stories, of a termite that sneaks aboard Noah's Ark and of terrorists that sneak aboard a luxury liner, are brilliant.  Some of the &quot;chapters&quot;, though, never manage to get going despite their promise. Thankfully &quot;A History&quot; closes as well, if not better, than it opens; the essay &quot;Parenthesis&quot; anchors the work while giving it its soul and &quot;The Dream&quot; gives born-again Christians (and Hitler) the heaven they deserve.<br /><br /> Also of note is the elan with which Barnes throws off styles, at one minute telling a story with an expert journalistic style, the next mastering the epistolary form.  Barnes shows himself to be a virtuoso with rare insight and skill.
044651506X|4.0|This is the first book by Nelson Demille that I have read.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a fast read, perfect for summer reading.  I thought the characters were well developed and the plot, though predictable, was good.  I guess I really enjoyed it because I lived on eastern Long Island and have seen Plum Island in the distance many times.  Though I doubt that there is buried treasure on Plum Island, the fact that the government does testing of horrible diseases over there is not comforting.  <br />  Try it, you will enjoy it.  It was very entertaining
0671004107|5.0|'Contact' is one of those rare gems which educate,  entertain, postulate, and theorize, taking you along for the ride.  It belongs to a genre that I have begun calling &quot;Science Faction&quot; - science fiction stories that are too real and almost possible; stories that could be plucked from the newspaper headlines of tomorrow or next week;  authors like Michael Chrichton.<br />     'Contact' is about discovering a radio message from space and its effect on humanity.  The science is thick but generally explained.  Science and religion are played against each other, not as enemies attempting to destroy each other, but as opposite sides of the same coin and possibly not as different as people might think.  It is a story of journey and discovery, of answering one of our most sought-after questions - 'Are we alone?' - and what happens when we are faced with the possibility of an answer - do we believe enough in ourselves to accept the answer, to respond to it, and to not fear the unknown?
0684874350|5.0|I found this book wonderful and uplifting.  It was such a revelation when I realized the voice of the child was aging slowly as the book went on.  I think that's what makes it brilliant.   I know Frank McCourt.  I worked with his wife and knew him before this book was a reality.  But what  I didn't know, was anything about his childhood or  what a wonderful writer he is.  Knowing the man he has become makes this book even more uplifting. Way to go Frank

I thought it was a dumb joke then. Now I keep my copy of \\"The Shining\\" safely stored the freezer as well. This book, even before the frightening climax at the end (which makes me cry like a baby every time), is truly creepy. When it isn't scaring you with room 217 or Jack's raves, it has a certain eerie undertone. You'll be afraid to go to sleep with this book lying beside you. Read it. Otherwise, you'll be missing out on one of the most moving, frightening, even poignant novels of modern times.

0151001820|2.0|The Flanders Panel was book with such a compelling story that many of the ridiculous idiosyncaries could be masked.  Not so with Perez-Reverte's second effort.  The absurdities are blown up ten-fold, showing the style for what it is -- basic noir.  As with the last book, it's well wrapped in &quot;art&quot;.  The first, great paintings;  with this, great literature  (What next -- a Mozart scandal?  Rand?).  But the booze and cigarettes, guys on the run, sympathetic dames with big breasts in seedy bars, men with too-young women, show the fine line that the author has been treading.  This time, he went to far.  The story is interesting, but at times totally ridiculous.  Pass on this one.  And find out with the third book what this author is really worth
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a GREAT book that put you in the mind of the main charector Ender Wiggin.

1563523302|4.0|I firmly believe in the principles, having seen it work for several people including my Dad.  I live in an area that is like a case study for the book.<br />  However, like other reviewers, I feel it would have been nice for the authors to tell us how these folks balance their lives.  Although the (car) price per pound thing is factual, I doubt any of the millionaires ever thought or care about this piece of trivia.<br />  I understand not overspending on a car, suit, watch, etc. But what is the best vacation they ever took?  Not spent the most - but the best. What is the most expensive gift they bought their wife on an anniversary? What kind of mutual funds did they pick?<br />  They spend several hours each month addressing their finances.  What are they doing? Do they regularly assess the performance of their stocks, or ???<br />  Did any of them not figure out the MND formula until their late 30's, or do you have to be like this from birth in order to make it into the club?     In other words, what makes them tick, not just the statistics
0345350499|2.0|I just finished reading this book. I think it's a great story and a fascinating perspective. I have to agree, however,  with the lone reviewer who criticizes the writing. I found the character development very erratic, as if Bradley suddenly tires of a character and decides to move on to someone else. Other than Morgaine, most of the characters do not evolve, although some of them  suddenly veer off into an entirely new personality with no little or no explanation at all. (Igraine and Kevin, for instance). Gueneviere, who is throughly detestable, displays occasional, but inexplicable, flashes of humanity, only to instantly revert to her standard sullen peeveishness. Characters commit the most egregious affronts to one another, then appear as old friends at the next feast. Expectations are not met - we are set up to anticipate plot deveolpments which never occur, and there are several contradictions and inplausibilities which I found annoying. I thought that the end of the book was hurried through while Bradley tried to cram in the rest of the Arthurian legend ( and every character ever remotely associated with it). That may be part of the problem with this book - she had too much material to fit in. Still, she had a great idea here and I wish she had taken more time to develop it.  I thought she was at her best when writing about the 'old faith' and she did a admirable job weaving that spell and making you feel the emotions of it. This could have been a great book rather than a good read. I'll still take T.H. White or Mary Stewart for my dose of the Matter of Britain

0684874350|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book based on the high praise it has, almost universally, received. But I found it difficult to read, given both the subject and, more importantly, the narrative voice. That voice might have appealed to me in a short story but wore thin over 60 pages, when I gave up. That's the point at which I realised the style wasn't going to change as Frank grew up--he wasn't just speaking in the voice of a child. I skimmed forward over the rest, which seemed to drone on.But then, I've never appreciated Ulysses either
0684874350|5.0|I really thought this book was excellent. The way Frank managed to change his tone and style as he grew older in the book was great. It's hard enough to get one style right! I really enjoyed his sense of humour too, particularly when God was all over his grandmother's backyard! Hopefully, this is the end of whatever hardship he came across. Fair play te ya Frank!
0399142851|2.0|Patricia Cornwell's newest Kay Scarpetta novel, Unnatural Exposure, is almost as disappointing as Hornet's Nest.  While the main story line of a disturbed person using biological agents as a weapon is interesting, the book ends in a rush without a satisfying conclusion. The writer's attempts to flesh out the characters' personalities fall flat, swinging wildly from important details of the character's motivation to an intrusion to the storyline.  Some of the details seem to me to be very contrived and more than a little implausible, especially Dr. Scarpetta's ability to mobilize the Army and the CDC on a moment's notice. I bought this book in hardcover, as I have all her recent books, but I'll be waiting for the paperback from now on

044651506X|5.0|From the Charm School to the Gold Coast to Plum Island and the Talbot Oddessy Demille is a great read and doesn't publish fast enough.  His description of the gold coast and its islands is accurate and informing and you set on the edge of your chair, holding the book tight waiting for the next murder, his/hers and who is the killer when he makes everyone from the police chief to the owner of a winery and maybe someone in Manhattan suspect.  It is a mystery book that you can't put down after you begin the first page. The only place he didn't include was the ferry to Block Island. I hope rewrites a sequel to this one. I have read everything that he has written and everytime I say this is the best yet. Don't hesitate to buy it, it's worth the price
0345315227|4.0|Even a mediocre Clarke book, which this is, contains far moreentertainment material than the average book.  It also contains morescience and thought-provoking ideas than the average science fiction novel.  That being said, it is unfortunate that this conclusion to the Odyssey isn't more exciting. Clarke never handled dialogue very well, and one exchange goes on for over two pages without identifying who is saying what.  If your characters have different speech cadences this isn't a problem, but as others have noted, his characters all sound alike to our ears. I enjoyed Clarke's speculations as to how far science would advance (and also where it would find limitations).  Paradoxically, even though I wasn't sure where the story was going, I was never really surprised when it got there! Summary: an enjoyable treat, more like reading a letter from an old friend than an exciting, twisting novel.  We know how he writes, we know his shortcomings, but it is still with a smile that we receive his latest work.
0812524586|4.0|A gripping read, BUT there are many flaws. First, I object to Ender's unrealistic age. NOT because of his intelligence.  But because  physically no 6-11 yr. old is capable of doing  the things in the book.  He's really more like  10 years older than he's supposed to be.  Even at age 25, I found it hard to believe in  Ender as a governor of a colony.  (Ironically, after a book worth of Ender as  as a youthful child, the next book makes him  practically immortal.)  Also I couldn't stand the Mormon subtext that  Card puts in the book (you've got to look VERY  close to see the sexism and the elitism).  Also, the language bothered me and prevented  me from giving this book to my child. (How many  times must Card use the word &quot;bastard&quot;???)  And some of the violence is very unnecessary.  I would have liked to re-edit this book for  Card yet another time and clean up all the flaws.  Also, the demise of Peter was oh so convenient.  And I always felt Peter was misunderstood.  Furthermore, the re-appearance of Mazar was so  very perdictable.  One more re-write and this  book will rate a 10.
0380002930|5.0|This is a good book. <br /> This is a great book.  <br />  Everyone knows this.  Reviews are going to go down for this book forever--it's gonna be a major pain to download.  No one really needs my two cents thrown in about it.  <br />  Ok, I'll make it short.  <br />  My dad introduced me to &quot;Watership Down&quot; when I was eight, and had already talked about it(I, in my weird kid fashion, got the idea it was the tumultous of rabbits who escaped the sinking of the Titanic.  Ehh, go fig).  What he did was buy me the video.  Ballabing ballaboom, I was hooked. THE movie, for me.  Friends had nightmares and were forever forbidden going over to my house cause I had watched it with them.  I was a lonely kid--in love.  <br />  I read the book a few years later.  Ballabing balla--well, you get the idea.  It's a good way to go, though.  <br />  (PLUG.  It's a rotten thing to advertise a book while reviewing another, but everyone knows &quot;Watership Down&quot;.  Not everyone knows William Horwood's &quot;Duncton Wood&quot;, but &quot;Watership Down&quot; fans are that much more likely to dig him.  When you're done here, check him out.  One thing, though: you've seen all these &quot;not for children&quot; warnings about &quot;Watership Down&quot;--make that a definate for &quot;Duncton Wood&quot; and other Duncton books.  END PLUG).
0385472951|2.0|I was really dissapointed by The Partner. No twist and turns,no surprises and a unlogical ending. To bad. I really liked, TheRainmaker, The Jury and The Firm. But this one was not at all up to his usual standard. By: Peter Carlsson, Sweden
0316920045|5.0|Infinite Jest is a work of genius; age the only criterion excepting it from 'Classic'status.  Wallace has created a world so bizarre,  yet it mirrors life in modern America. A hyperbolical view of society that allows us to laugh - uproariously - in the face of an oncoming wave of entropy, even as it envelops us.<br />The english language has some 5,000,000 words, and Wallace made an admirable attempt at using all of them - in one book.  Laden with wonderfully complex metaphor, this book was painfully funny.  Infinite Jest is going to be read and pondered for decades
1556154844|5.0|The subtitle of McConnell's book is &quot;A Practical Handbook of Software Construction&quot;. I have found that it lives up to this claim excellently. Like Brook's classic &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; Code Complete offers practical advice on the real-world challenges of software development.  Code Complete contains 33 chapters, which can be read as separate essays.<br />  To entry-level programmers and computer science students, this book is an excellent primer on the fundamentals of the industry. For experienced programmers, this book is an great way to review your own development strategies and best practices. For project managers, Code Complete serves as a great source of ideas for process improvement, as well as a great learning tool to pass on to new entry-level hires. My employer has used several chapters out of Code Complete as the basis for discussion topics.<br />   McConnell writes in an easy-to-read, entertaining style that has made him one of the most popular authors in the field.  His book &quot;Rapid Development&quot;, is also an extremely popular book on software development, and many (including me) are anxiously awaiting his next work, &quot;Software Project Survivial Guide&quot;.<br />In short, Code Complete belongs in the library of every serious developer
0880381736|5.0|This book grabbed a hold on me from the first page and never let me go!  I bought this book merely because it was written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.  I had bought the last three (Dragons of winter night,Dragons of spring dawning, and Dragons of summer flame) first, and read them , I loved them, and not reading the first one, I didn't understand some of the other books.  So finially I found Dragons of autumn twilight, and bought it.  Now I have quite a few of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; books and hope to be brought back to Krynn again and again
094113086X|5.0|This work's secondary title, &quot;The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,&quot; is but a small clue to what lies between the covers. The chronicle of Slavomir Rawicz, a Polish cavalry officer who escaped a Soviet Siberian forced labor camp in 1941 and completed an incredible yearlong journey on foot through China, the Gobi Desert and into India is also a testament to human survival and a comforting reminder that human decency still remains in our too-often cruel world. <br /> The book's greatest strength lies in Rawicz's ability to mentally detach himself from his experience and recount in great detail and with notable insight events ranging from the horror of his last cavalry charge against the Germans and subsequent Soviet captivity to picturesque descriptions of Mongol social customs and snowy Himalayan peaks. It is a unique blend of high drama and intrigue, anthropological commentary and how-to wilderness survival paced by a steady, no-nonsense narrative. <br /> The overwhelming irony of this cavalryman's odyssey was that despite the presence of a raging global war fast becoming notorious for mass ethnic extermination, he received nothing but kindness and generosity from all of the native peoples he encountered on his trek. It is this alone that makes &quot;The Long Walk&quot; a &quot;must read.&quot

No, the fictional characters over the generations are not!  The only common thread is the inheritance pattern of ancestors over the centuries, which is trite and meaningless description.  The problem is that none of the characters or their historical situations are explored in any depth.  I just couldn't bear to waste the summer plodding through another 700 pages of the grey-haired, webbed-fingers ancestors who lived in what is now London
0887306667|5.0|This book is exactly what its title suggests.  But what makes it so valuable is that each principle is backed with numerous specific examples from virtually every industry segment.  To the marketing novice, this should be a first read ... a must read ... and a subsequent reference.  To the marketing expert, this is a great validator and benchmark.  There is valuable insight on marketing strategy for virtually all marketers lurking in the pages of this title.  This lands on my top ten for all topics
0345403959|2.0|Honestly, it's time for a new story.  David Eddings has told the same worn-out story at least 3 times now.  (Belgariad, Mallorean [sp], Diamond Throne, etc.)  &quot;Belgarath&quot; is an expert re-hashing  and fleshing out of story already presented in other novels.  The only thing that keeps Eddings' work going is his characterizations, and even his characters are starting to look the same.....
0671799320|5.0|I bought this book at an airport for my father but during the flight after going over over the inflight mag for the 10th time I decided to give the the prize a shot (that was over Saudi Arabia.. how apt?) and 5 hours later though I had a terrible pain in my neck, I refused to stop reading!(I was reading even when standing in the immigration queue) It is, arguably, more exciting and fascinating than a Grisham novel. Infact it is just like a novel where the hero (or is it the villian?) is oil and other characters include the rest of the world. A must for anybody who is interested not just in oil industry but the socio-econo-geogoro-politico developments of the 20th centur
0345350499|5.0|This was undoubtedly the best book I've ever read. The whole view of the geography, the history, the wars between the saxons and the romans, which actually develop through the book, as the 'horse god' is forgotten and traded by the Cross; the characters, who grow old and wiser, and with the time acquire a new position towards the other people as well as towards the very world they live in - vide Ingraine, Arthur, Kevin and even Morgaine; and the ever-present conflict between the Christian faith and the old gods, represented, respectively, by Gwenhwyfar and Morgaine, are only part of what makes this story one of the greatest literary jewels these times. When I ended it, I felt like it had become a part of me
0399142851|3.0|The best part of the whole entire book is on  page 149, when Kay and her niece are using LCD, a liquid crystal display, it's a video display - you know you put goggles on and gloves etc. Did you see Lawnmower Man? It's where you can actually go inside an area (this time the killer's room where the body parts are displayed) and snoop around and try to get clues. This area was provided by the killer when &quot;deadoc&quot; emailed her pictures of what he/she had done. When Kay does finally catch up to the killer surprise - she instantly recognizes where she once was. The ending was a good one and for once I didn't have a clue as to who the killer would be. Usually I do. I enjoyed the book but written so damn easy and Pat's got everything down pat. She is a genius when it comes to the medical jargon and the virus stuff. I just remember how great her first novels were. Its like reading Stephen King - we know his work so well (do we?) that we know how she is going to write the tale. There are many clues as to who the killer finally is. Some one working with rabbit hairs, expert in using a medical cutting tool, someone with a knowledge of viral diseases. Man - I was surprised she took so long solving the case. (Just kidding). I didn't have a clue. But you know it is always someone in the story line. Jan Beggs, Mobile, A
068484267X|5.0|Never have I had a book do this to me to this extreme!  Frank McCourt's writing is so vivid and  compassionate, that I felt I was one of his siblings experiencing the hardships of the poor Irish Catholic childhood.  When Frank looses his little sister, I cried as if she where my own. Also, now, my refrigerator is filled with less frivolous foods. We need to appreciate all that we have today.  Later when Frank describes his experience preparing for his first job, I laughed to no end.  His grandmother must have had a good laugh on Frank, also. Hopefully, in your afterlife, you gain a sense of humor.  I wanted the book to continue.  I felt as if Frank was writing a letter about his childhood to me.
0684874350|5.0|I spent time today talking to my uncle about his youth in Warsaw during the 20s. A kitchen and bedroom for 10 people; then the kitchen was sublet. Just a week before I had read this heartfelt and gripping memoir. I cried and laughed; I was uplifted and depressed. This is a truly great book. It seems to sound alike after a time, but just as some bands' music seems to sound alike, the pleasure is in the nuances and details, and testiment to the human spirit
0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourt is a story teller in the truest sense of the Celtic meaning of story telling; he involves the heart and the intellect. His descriptions of poverty and deprivation will tear you asunder, but leave you alive with understanding. His expression of the true, morbid reality of hunger and the behavior it motivates are intertwined with a child's blind love of his family. Frank McCourt's tale is emotive and real; no romance here, only the hard realities of survival. At points, the store drags on, but with a purpose. He ensures that the reader understands the human heart. An excellent, historically accurate story of one families supreme effort to survive in a country dominated by another's power. Oh! Limerick, my rose with many spotted buds
0395078016|5.0|Adolf Hitler was one of the most loved and hated men of the20th Century.  In \\"Mein Kampf\\" we learn about the author'schildhood, the collapse of Germany in 1918, the founding of his National Socialist German Worker's Party and the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 which sent Herr Hitler to Landsberg Prison where he wrote his famous book.  The author goes into detail on policy questions which will later be realized just before and during the Second World War.  The book is said to be very prophetic in that sense.  Any rumors of the difficulty in reading the work are false; it is easy to read and highly interesting. In short, this book is a must for those wishing to gain a more thorough understanding of German National Socialism and its creator.
0930289234|5.0|Probably hands down the greatest novel of all time, Watchmen managed to do what few others, if no others, books have ever accomplished: combined intelligent storytelling with powerful artwork to make this a story truly for all the senses.  Both beautifully complement each other, embellishing the story and taking the novel to another level entirely.  I've read it about ten times and each time I still find myself moved, shocked, impressed and always coming away satisified.  Truly a great novel
0385472951|4.0|I finally read The Partner.  I didn't rush out and buy it.Grisham's cocky lawyer and political animal DA ... etc. formula hadlost its edge somewhere around The Chamber and The Rainmaker. I did enjoy The Partner.  I think it was the way the plot worked backwards from the kidnapping.  The main characters were edgier. The conclusion was more satisfying.  Sure, much of it was predictable.  All of the loose ends were too neatly tied.  But, let's reinforce Big John!  It has been four years since he's coaxed us to go a few extra pages each night. Maybe next Spring he'll surprise us with humble lawyers and courageous prosecutors.  Maybe an innocent client will lose.  Go get 'em, John!

0399142851|4.0|After &quot;Hornets Nest&quot; the return to Dr. Kay is reassuring.  This book looks to be thrown together , and comes to an abrupt, and not very believable end.  I see almost a disbain for her readers.  Maybe Cornwelll should take a break--she has grown much to cynical and cavalier.  P.S.  Her remarks concerning Oprah and Stedman were unprofessional, and totally uncalled for.
0140143505|5.0|Before I was to move to London for a six-month stay, I read Helene Hanff's &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; hoping to get a feel for the city I was about to meet, or at least for what it used to be.  A compilation of letters between a struggling writer (Hanff) in New York City and a London bookstore owner, this book paints a picture of harsh wartime realities tempered by a blooming long-distance friendship.  Upon my arrival in London, I took a cab from Victoria Station to Bayswater, and as we wound through the heart of the city, we drove down Charing Cross Road.  With open doors and dusty window displays, the bookstores lining the street were at the same time  inviting and haunting, rousing the ghosts of the city.  &quot;84 Charing Cross Road&quot; echoes the voices of real people, and those echoes still resonate through the streets of London
0399142851|4.0|patricia cornwell is most definitely my favorite author, BUT i have to say this book, although very good, was in no way near her best.  we all know she is capable of a better book than this. i'm just glad i wasn't the only one who thought so! i mean come on! i think marino only said &quot;yo&quot; twice in the whole book! what's up with that? the other books had marino saying &quot;yo&quot; at least once in every sentence!! and marino and kay's relationship seemed distant and not as close as they had  seemed to be in the previous novels. but all in all, it still is a pretty good story, for what it is anyway..

It defines<br />that which we all seek from birth to death: HAPPINESS. It defines what makes happiness, why<br /> we feel it, and why we do not.

0399103422|5.0|Although I missed The Godfather movie when it first came out - I was only 12 - I have seen all 3 Godfather movies several times since then.  With the recent 25th anniversary release of the first movie and the 4-night showing of The Godfather I and II on TV at the end of July, I made a point to  read the book.  It is well-written and a tremendous read.  I thoroughly enjoyed the hundreds of lines and quotes that were copied over to the movies (Godfather I and II).  The movies, with all its fine actors and directing, comes close to matching the quality of the book.
0899662439|5.0|I love this book, besides the story, there is delicate sarcasm and irony that can make you laugh for hours, I can hardly remember reading a better book in my life
0385472951|4.0|Yes, it was a 'regular' Grisham book, with the same lawyers,crooks, money wires, courtrooms, etc etc...  But it was wellwritten. I'm confused that everyone was surprised by the ending, half way into it, I thought that's what would happen, nothing else was happening. This book would've been terrible if anything else had happened. However once again Grisham did a poor job ending it, he could've added a few more pages, drawn it out more. If you read this, stop before the end, and just make up your own ending, it'll be much more enjoyable this way.
0787103063|5.0|I'm 18 and I don't read lot and I was waiting to read Emma. So I read Pride and Prejudice.<br />I think it's a great book. I thouhgt that since it's an old book it would be boring.

0671004107|4.0|While this book is in need of editing and is at times a much too explicit an advertisment for Mr. Sagan's scientific philosophy (read _The Demon Haunted World_), it is still a good book with a very well done ending. This is not science fiction in the traditional sence as much as it is a sort of a science novel, in the safe vein as Gregory Benford's _Timescape_ (which I enjoyed more than _Contact_). The other major problem with this work is that Sagan's forte is as a nonfiction writer and not as a novelist. So at times _Contact_ shrugs under the weight of too much wordless narration without dialogue. Many of his ideas are interesting but feel out of place in the novel, thrown in to boost the page count. Nevertheless, it's worth reading if you're a Carl Sagan fan or a fan of science fiction, but don't expect incredibly wonderful Arthur C. Clarke-esque things. There are better &quot;first contact&quot; novels out there, like Clarke's _Rendevous with Rama_ or _2001_ to name two of the best.I don't intend to see the movie, since a _lot_ of things from the book appear to have been changed
B000002HJD|5.0|I recommend this compilation of Morrison's prose for those interested in poetry, literature, or The Doors.  To hear any author recite his or her own work is an experience revealing their deepest desires and passions.  The opportunity to hear the expressions of Jim Morrison as told by himself combined with the background music of The Doors, makes An American Prayer a journey of the mind through the eyes of one of the greatest poets of the century.

B000002UB3|5.0|By the end of 1969, the Beatles had come to realize that they couldn't play the game anymore.  Relations amoung the boys were now stretched to the breaking point.  But John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey would not let it end until they released a final masterpiece; a final farewell to their fans across the world. The result was the epic &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, one of the finest rock ablums ever.  This album would see George Harrison come of age as a songwriter with the unforgetable &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.  Ringo's &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; would become his signature song (McCartney actually wrote &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;).  John would continue the avante garde with &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot; and &quot;Because&quot;, and Paul would end the Beatles era with some words to remember with &quot;The End&quot;.  &quot;Abbey Road&quot; was a perfect sendoff.  The four of them would never record together again.  But with &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the world will forever remember the greatness of the Beatles. END
0671004611|5.0|The only reason I would classify this book as a 9 and not a 10 is due to the lack of verifiable confirmation by other authorities.      Colonel Phillip J. Corso can be verified as being an aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the internet.  The only difference being the spelling of the first name Phillip vs Philip.      If Col. Corso is the legitimate author and has not made up a work of fiction by interweaving fact and fiction, then this is probably the most heroic thing that an individual could do.       I would consider Col. Corso a great patriot that will almost certainly give the US Government back to the people.  The USA citizens should not tolerate a secret government.  Even if was necessary to protect the citizens until an answer was understood, Colonel Corso indicates that the alien threat is at least blunted.  He even intimates that the world now has global protection and other world threats are at least under control and the world is protected.      If the book only had endorsements or reliable witness testimony then perhaps we can believe that the Roswell Incident did occur and aliens did crash land on our planet.       It is high time other reliable witnesses reveal their part in the cover up and help all of the pieces of the puzzle to be put together.  Then maybe Major Jesse Marcel and other first hand witnesses can rest in peace, especially William &quot;Mac&quot; Brazel.
B000002UA9|4.0|This is the first LP (long-player) the Beatles made at Abbey Road.  Before making &quot;Please Please Me&quot; in 1963, the band recorded some songs with singer Tony Sheridan, and laid down a few tracks during an audition at Decca.  Following their first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, this record would showcase the Beatles performance repetoire at this time. It features many of the songs the band played to their growing throng of fans throughout Liverpool.  With gems like &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, and &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, we begin to see how the Lennon-McCartney song writting team would become great.  In addition to these Beatles originals, we are treated to several covers like &quot;Anna (Go With Him)&quot; and &quot;Baby, It's You&quot;, as well as an unbelievable performance of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by John Lennon.  &quot;Please Please Me&quot; is wonderful rock and roll and fluffy pop.

B000002UB6|4.0|&quot;Let It Be&quot; is all that is left of the Beatles aborted &quot;Get Back&quot; project from early 1969.  The concept: forget all the fancy sound loops and double-tracking that made records like Sgt. Pepper so unforgetable.  Forget the over-dubs.  This recording was the Beatles raw; mistakes and all.  Quite simply, what &quot;Let It Be&quot; tries to capture is the essence of the Beatles of the past; The boys sitting around jaming in the studio before all the screaming girls, before the death threats, before the mania. The recording accomplishes this at times.  &quot;Let It Be&quot; has some fantastic moments.  Classics like &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; are simply marvelous.  And we get to hear some older Beatles tunes (&quot;One After 909&quot; from 1963 and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; from 1967), never previously recorded until now.  But there are a few problems with this record.  The record was produced by Phil Spector who over-produced a few numbers, and did some poor edting at times.  &quot;Dig It&quot;, a fabulous John Lennon rocker is edited to a few measly seconds, and an old Liverpool folk song called &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; gets tracked despite breaking down in the middle.  But the essence of the Beatles shines through.  Regardless of what you think about Spector's producing, &quot;Let It Be&quot; is a sold performance.  The fab four were breaking up by this time, and yet the music remained as great as ever. END

Filled with thought provoking intelligent writing and more than its fair share of wackyness, this book will keep you up till the break of dawn wondering what is happening all around us.  The Illuminatus trilogy is not a easy read, nor should it be.  It explains that we as individuals really haven't got a clue as to how the world works, or really who is in power and why.  Filled with sex, violence, drugs, and loads of other good stuff this is not for the timid.

0385472951|2.0|I think it's time for Grisham to take a break from writing anddo something else to get recharged.  His best work was his first book.The next two were fairly good and different from the first, A Time to Kill.  Perhaps if he took a few years off he would come up with an original storyline again. I have read all of his books but I would gladly wait several years for a quality novel.

These two albums would sit at #1 and #2 for weeks to come.  &quot;With the Beatles&quot; starts with a bang.  From the first few bars of &quot;It Won't Be Long&quot;, we are treated to a rock and roll feast from the mop tops.  Some fantastic songs highlight this record.  McCartney shines with his classic &quot;All My Loving&quot;and his tender rendition of &quot;Till There Was You&quot;. Lennon's song writing soars with gems like &quot;Little Child&quot; and &quot;All I've Go to Do&quot;.  George Harrison gets his first credit with a swift little rocker called &quot;Don't Bother Me&quot;, and Lennon ends the album with his scortching version of &quot;Money&quot; in much the same fasion as he ended &quot;Please Please Me&quot; with &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.  &quot;With The Beatles&quot; is grittier than &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, and therefor, better.

His characters are so vividly described and the scenery is so well detailed, it is like you are remembering and experiencing it myself. The only reason I gave it a 9, was cause of the length, and because of the way it skipped around so much, but don't let that stop you from reading this book. Tom Bux, Carlisle Pa.
B000002UAI|4.0|Late 1964 would prove to be lean times for the Beatles as song writers.  Beatlemania had reached a frenzied pitch by this point, and the boys spent  more time in airports and hotel rooms than in the studio making more music.  As a result, &quot;Beatles For Sale&quot; would be a bit disappointing when compared to it's predecessor &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;.  The fabs were doing covers again.  They probably didn't have the time to write enough quality originals for this album.  Even so, some of these originals are instant classics.  &quot;I'm a Loser&quot;, &quot;Baby's in Black&quot;, and &quot;No Reply&quot; are some of the memorable tunes from this record.  Most pop bands would be thrilled with this sort of output.  But the Beatles weren't like most bands.  This band was capalbe of greatness.  And even though the stress was showing, some wonderful songs would shine through. END
B000002UAF|5.0|With &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;, the Beatles would break new ground.  It was their first LP to feature only Lennon-McCartney originals.  The result is unforgetable.  This record is the best of the &quot;early&quot; Beatles recordings.  By 1964, Lennon and McCartney had moved beyond the level of being &quot;good&quot; song writters.  Now, they were becoming &quot;great&quot;.  Lennon's gorgeous &quot;If I Fell&quot;, McCartney's energetic &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot;, and knock out performances of &quot;I Should Have Known Better,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;, and &quot;When I Get Home&quot; are just some of the highlights of this recording.  Truly, &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is the crowning achievment of the Beatles early days.  It shows a tremendous advancement in songwriting, and points the way toward the Beatles of the years to come. END

The 245 pages (or so) seem to fly by and only when you've finished do you (or did I) realize what had passed.  The book is somewhat subtle like its main character, but never hides its intentions.  While the title character struggles through what he believes to be questions of his occupation, he indeeds, in my opinion, touches on many subjects that are more universal.  What is dignity?  What is honor?  What  is that intrinsic quality to which we refer to as character?  Through these engaging questions the reader is revealed a quickly changing world and the casualties it takes in its realm.  Without giving away much more, I entreat any readers pleased by local &quot;character&quot; and interested in the qualities that not only make us human, but make us good, to read The Remains of the Day for further enjoyment
0887308589|5.0|Scott Adams's book is painfully funny. The characters, the settings, the attitudes described in the book are all real and reflect what truly happens in corporate America. Adams's writing and cartoons probe into almost every facet of corporate life from idiotic management fads(re-engineering, downsizing, quality teams) to  ordinary episodes involving idiotic middle managers. Be warned though; he may be talking about you and your life and that is where the laughter turns into painful introspection
0385472951|4.0|I have read several of John Grisham's novels and was excitedabout this one after reading the first chapter on the Web before itwas released.  This latest effort is a quick read -- I couldn't help wanting to turn the page to confirm/find out what happened next.  I had mixed feelings about the the lead character, Patrick.  Further, I had problems with the plausibility of a few aspects of the plot.  I found a few things to be predictable (things were much too neatly tied together or resolved) and the manner in which Patrick's closest \\"friends\\" took his actions at face value, almost admiring him for them, were a little unbelievable.  Because of my mixed feelings on Patrick's crime(s), I found the end to be appropriate.  It prevented a \\"happily ever after\\" storybook finale, offsetting the problems I found with the plot.  If you can overlook these \\"faults\\" THE PARTNER is a fun read and should make an interesting translation to the big screen -- since we all know it's only a matter of time ...
0140057242|5.0|I remember reading &quot;Adventures of Sherlock<br />Holmes as a teenager.<br /><br />Each chapter is an adventure.<br /><br />The clues are there ready to reveal the mystery.<br /><br />Will you be Holmes and solve the mystery?<br /><br />Will you be Watson, waiting for Holmes to decipher the clues for you?<br /><br />Everyone strives to be Holmes.<br />  Sometimes you are.<br />  I was in the &quot;Hounds of the Baskervilles&quot;.<br />  Being Watson is just as entertaining, when the clues unravel to solve the  mystery.&lt;BR
0399142851|2.0|Patricia Cornwell's new book Unnatural Exposure is a majordisappointment.  The development of the plot is senseless, and themain character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, has become self-absorbed and implausible.  For example, she continues to nag Marino about his poor personal health habits, but proceeds to walk unprotected into a house where a woman has died of a deadly virus which Scarpetta suspects is the same as the pox virus she had found in a torso she had just autopsied.  How smart is that? <br /> In another scene, Scarpetta has Marino come to her house in the middle of the night to see an alarming e-mail message she had received.  The good doctor comes completely unglued when Marino moves a file and sits in her chair at the computer to view the message.  Is this supposed to make us think that Dr. Scarpetta is a tough-as-nails, her-own-woman kind of gal? <br /> It makes no sense that Dr. Scarpetta is exposed to the virus, unprotected, on three separate occasions and never comes down with it. Others do.  It can't be because Dr. Scarpetta has such a strong immune system.she does come down with the flu during this time, but apparently is immune to the deadly pox virus.  Right! <br /> Maybe Dr. Scarpetta should look into early retirement options.
0679745203|2.0|It has been a long, long time since I didn't finish a book.  The ramblings and looseness of plot did not hold my attention long enough to finish this book.  After reading other reviews, maybe I should try it on a better day.  After 200 pages, I gave up
0679445099|5.0|Scarpetta remains one of the most compelling characters in all of fictiondom. I especially enjoyed the relationship between the good Doc and her niece Lucy. I believe Lucy could carry a book all by her self. Cornwell's blend of the Internet, a new virus and revenge was handled expertly. Marino continues to be another character that like. He is the perfect antithesis to Kay.  I'm still not sold on Benton as her love interest or as a viable character in the series. I look forward to the next book  in this series
0393316041|5.0|I am a college professor.  I have been having my classes read this book for the past 5 years.  It is one of the best books that students can read in order to answer the question: Why am I in college? To Learn.  Most people emphasize the adventures and overlook the simple beauty of the book, i.e. lifelong learning.  This book is a testament to the process of continuous learning throughout your life.  College is where you start to put together the skills that you will use to learn for the rest of your life.  It is my contention that I have learned more since I earned my Ph.D. than I did before.  Feynman demonstrates that as long as you are alive, you are learning.  A simple message indeed: enjoy learning.

B0000020C4|5.0|This recording goes beyond anything I have ever heard before in my life.  With many other recordings, some of the major characters have weaker actors in their roles.  I am at a loss to find such a problem with ANY role in the 10th Anniversary.  For those people who are not already fans of Les Miserables, this recording will make you one.  <br />  Part of the reason I fell in love with the musical, was the sensational Colm Wilkinson's voice.  Not only can this man bring power and passion into his voice, but his range is unbelievable!  No one is more comfortable in their upper range than Colm is.  His Bring Him Home is easily the most touching, and emotional song he does, and does extrodinaraly well. <br /> The other actor who I feel deserves special notice would be the one and only, Philip Quast.  I must say, that before listening to this recording, I could not have cared less about Javert.  But in the time it took for Philip to sing Stars, my opinion had compleatly changed.  To make a listener move from indifference to adoration is a feat that no one should scoff at.  From the moment Philip steps up to sing, his voice demands my attention.  And one can do little less than give it to him.  In the words of my sister, &quot;He's God's gift to people with ears!&quot; <br /> I would not want it to seem that the only reason to buy this recording is for Wilkinson and Quast.  Ruthie Henshall is, and forever will be, the only Fantine, with a voice like an angel, and the best interpretation, she is head and shoulders above anyone else.  Lea Salonga's On My Own is easily the best version of the song, and A Little Fall of Rain with Michael Ball make me cry every time I hear it.  Just to name a couple.  Every actor/actress is worthy of their own novel, but I will not write that here.  In short, there is more talent in this one recording, than in any other I have heard before, or am likely to hear in the future. END
