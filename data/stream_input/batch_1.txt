B00LPRXQ4Y|1|As it was used, the method that Ford used to attach it to the wheel was worn and thus the cap flew off into the night on a gravel road
B000C7S0TO|5|Put it in fine, no problems. Shipping was decent 5 days.
B000CO9WE4|5|Fit wonderfully on my 36HP Pro-Drive motor.
B000GKD5NI|5|Good for the price!  So far I have put it up in the back window of my 2010 Camry and after several times using my spit and pushing very hard on the suction cups so that you get a black circle effect from looking at it from the outside of the window, they have stuck and have not come off at all.  Make sure you use spit and apply pressure around the entire suction cup to make a secure seal.  Like I said from outside it should look like an all black circle if you have a nice seal going.  Has been up for around one month and has stayed.  It could have been made a little wider as it doesn't cover the entire back window top to bottom, but does seem to be pretty good coverage side to side.
B009SDA7TE|5|Fit perfectly on my 2012 Tundra with stock alu rims.
B00KV15KRG|5|Product fits well and closely matches color of original equipment.....much better quality than the original.
B0002JMAKW|5|convenient ,fast delivery, and fair price
B00XJKMM6S|5|is good
B000C5CEKC|5|wonderful.  if you need a locking cap, and we did for our jeep grand cherokee as there was a rash of gas siphoning last winter, this is a good one.  no problems.
B00GD9R2A8|1|Does not work with my Ford Taurus. But there's no description on this item whether it will or will not.
B00RM327NG|4|I really loved this little mount; now I like it. It fell a little more often than I hoped (maybe my phone was too heavy? Maybe i didn't connect the magnet exactly?). Either way, it was great when I needed the GPS. It did eventually fall off one night with the phone and disappeared into my car. I found it much later, attached to a magnet in my car door and smashed from my closing the door. So GREAT idea, but the magnet is weird.
B0071NL7UQ|5|Just what I wanted.
B00DSOL0FY|5|Great product and fast service.
B00GRV48TK|5|Appears to be well made. It does what it's supposed to do.
B000E4PCGE|3|Product was as described, new and a great look. Only bad thing is that one of the screws was stripped so I couldn't tighten all three.
B005Z8HAUK|5|SO much quieter than other compressors.  VERY quick as well.  You will not regret this purchase.
B0043AV4NK|5|Great for the price, only<br />Issue was the silencer was a little bent and it rattles when the car is revved. Overall great quality
B00CDHD76C|5|Nice set of tools for the edc bag...I have used this a few times now since purchase and there seems to be a bit to fit everything in a small compact package
B000CF1XO0|5|Everything ok
B003VLBPJA|3|I hope the hooks are strong enough.
B00HYYNWEQ|1|Very differcult to set up. Didn't want to warranty until I told them I bought them from amazon. Big Bike Parts I won't be buying anything from them ever again. I installed the FOBO, sensors, downloaded the appl. and they started to work right away. 3 weeks on my Harley and there working great.
B00JDQ44X6|2|For
B00NHJO9BW|5|Wiring was simple, and since mine has the side airbags I had the heaters installed in the seats. Love the look of the controls. It adds about 12w per step for a total of 60W when on the highest setting per seat.
B00K2MYPY8|5|I love these lights!
B000CODGZU|5|There great for i have had them on other trucks
B000VUASMY|1|Poorly made showing fiber/ thread material (white) on all black surface did not look good.
B00OPNRMHW|5|Very nice, high quality, gloss black Kidney Grill.
B000BRJSVE|5|Came with everything needed.
B00ETHGCDY|5|This decal is literally dope itself I love it and thanks for the free gift with my purchase
B00JH2DL4O|4|Fit my 2010 Jeep Wrangler perfectly and saved me a ton of money as the dealer was going to charge more than double the cost for the part.
B000BTO0CY|5|Air Lift builds a quality product and stands behind it. Don't let one whiner make you believe otherwise!<br />I installed this set on my Toyota T100 2wd. It fit perfectly, installed easily and the one issue I did have, AirLift customer service handled swiftly and without question. I look forward to these air springs giving us many miles of worry free towing of our Vintage Canned Ham Trailer, even with the bed of the truck loaded with my Motorcycle and everything but the kitchen sink
B00O14U6JG|4|Discolors very easily if stretched too hard.
B00BI8RTAC|5|works great
B0015PTXAW|5|Cool design.
B00OTBCIRE|1|It was nice for a month than got a leak in it and trying to figure out how to warnty it
B00NPYXAWS|5|I recommend this item. Hi, While I haven't had to use it yet.....thank goodness.....I am so thankful to have it in my families and my vehicles. Looks very sturdy and saw a special on the news with the same tool and it worked great! So Glad I Ordered them!
B00WE65J3G|5|Love it ! great quality easy install
B001U6JWOS|2|Purchased the gray and black ones a while back was kind of easy to install once you watch the video on YouTube Not such a great fit but great for looks and seat protection Would advise you to cover them with a towel on long hot days and if your be driving for awhile or traveling a distances
B000NCI854|4|Charges fine. Battery clips do not grip tightly after a few uses. I have oiled them etc. but it seems that the spring has just to weak for the job.
B00LPIKK38|5|needed for the windows. Keeps out people.
B00ZLR8C3Y|4|Thanks, I got the stickers
B00G3JVS8A|5|Thanks
B000IY8OKQ|5|The only plug wires i buy are NGK . cant beat them and amazon has the best prices on them!. if you have another brand on there now expect to see a power boost and better gas millage
B009AA9K20|2|These do not fit a 2008 Nissan Sentra I had to return.
B008OMB5G4|5|Great product at a great price. And shipped ontime.
B00K72C1T4|4|Works for maintaining, but causes terrible noises. Does not work to recharge a dead battery, read is not completely accurate, reads as battery good, when battery is not charged enough to start vehicle.
B00092893E|5|Was as advertised.
B000WOZSGK|2|Threaded Stem does NOT have a Cap Imbedded in the rubber which stiffens the corrugated part.  Stem threaded part is the only thing holding onto the rubber and will pull out of rubber when tightened onto cycle bracket. Threaded stud is correct size to fit hole in motorcycle bracket, yet Hole through stem is too small to allow all wires with connectors to pass through.
B001KSCDWE|5|Delivered as expected.
B002MQFTLU|5|Just what I needed.  With a little help from a youtube DIY video it fixed the problem with out a visit to a mechanic.
B00DIMI9LY|5|Well designed and pumps fast!
B00NGGT7VS|1|Too small for my Mom's caddy windshield, would not stay up under the sun visors.
B0012PJFH6|5|A little beefier than the shocks removed from this 05 trailblazer, but they fit fine and made it ride a lot better.
B00A70CLZ0|3|These shipped much faster than I thought they would, coming from what looks to be China. Initial quality was good, but not as good as what I would expect for the price. I only gave 3 stars because after a few months the caps in the front got loose and one of them fell out while driving so I then only had three left. I've had this problem before with cheaper caps made with less durable plastic that was subject to warping from the heat of the brakes and subsequent expansion of the steel wheel. This cap set was made out of a better plastic but still wasn't good enough. I think hub caps should be made out of high temp plastic (that's still flexible) or metal so they don't have this problem.<br /><br />I ended up just using the full wheel covers that came with my car new (2015 Honda Fit), even though I hate wheel covers. I painted them so they don't look as cheap.
B002XM5GHA|5|Exactly what I needed. Seems to hold up well.
B00605DUI8|5|Nice and quiet muffler for my '02 Jeep Liberty.  Sure was better sounding than the stupid flowmaster that the previous own installed on it.  I've had other FM mufflers on pickups that sounded great but not this one.  This Walker muffler fit nicely, was quiet -- Amazon recommended buying exhaust springs and bolts with this that I didn't need and ended up returning.  This muffler has it's own bolts but you will have to supply your own nuts....  I had a set and used those.  Still waiting on the exhaust pipe to show up but even with just the muffler, it's much quieter.
B004FCIK1U|5|Excellent Thank You..
B0051UPKZ4|5|Great product
B000YE6RFO|3|Product arrived quickly. Didn't end up using so I returned them.
B00UY6JAP6|5|Looks great and works much better than the the cheaper ones. Also the is no moisture issues
B002XLHUQG|5|a great product to stabilize your trailer, and eliminate the rocking motion.
B002TPRNFE|5|Love these dusters, this had an added bonus of smaller duster for interior of vehicle. Second one I have owned.<br />Read how to care for them and they will last a decade.
B006DD95YK|5|Great
B00KZD8ME8|1|This item does not fit the 2004 coupe model. At all. Not sure why someone wrote that it doors. I'm returning this.
B00FOX5D9Q|5|great one i like it
B00FMWCI9W|5|received mats very quickly and they met my expectations
B0036R6IT6|5|Put this on our ATV makes riding with my husband more comfortable. Wish I had got the sooner. Takes a little time to assemble.
B00EEKGD4O|5|works great!!!  highly recommend it.  great value.
B00RM327NG|5|I have been using this for about a month now and love it. It makes it easy to keep track of my phone, and if I do need to glance at my phone it helps keep my eyes UP and more on the road.  Everyone who rides with me is always impressed and asked how it works.  Makes it easy to follow GPS and connect my car charger and my AUX cable.  I'm currently using the sticker on my phone, and kept the square piece to use between my case and phone for my next upgrade.  Great buy, great price!
B000CQBG1O|1|Wow, after reading the negative reviews there is concurrence on:<br />-Bolts are MUCH shorter than OEM and not long enough to engage<br />-Springs are not ground on the ends, longer and difficult to compress.<br />-Threaded portion is smaller diam. than OEM (Yikes!) so the original weld nuts are not reused.<br />-Highly susceptible to corrosion.<br />I think I may opt for some new M8 x 70 hex bolts with flat washers, thread through the original weldnuts and then add new M8 hex nuts.  All stainless if I can find, but regular cadmium plated steel should be better than these.
B0007UQ2N2|5|Very useful
B000JFTF7U|5|I have a 2004 klr 650 with a pelacin case on the bike and the cover fit great.
B00WRX85LO|5|Great product. Thank you.
B00GIEPBNS|5|Perfect match.  My car looks almost new.  I just had to pop off the plastic surround and pop them on my car.  It took about 2 seconds.
B00OVA3KO8|5|Such a happy addition to my ride!
B000EEU0IO|5|Love the wood bead seat cover
B00THPGZEY|5|Love these stickers, I put them on my kayak and they look awesome.  I've used my kayak several times since putting them on and they are still looking good.
B0052FRT2A|2|Parts where not correctly made. Took some modification to fit. Would not purchase again.
B00RV83UUG|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Such a funny thing. But this product is great!  I am always dropping cel phone, credit cards and all kids of things down the crack.. No more! It blends in so you don't even notice it!
B007GFK7S2|5|Hands Down, These are the Best Grips out there and I have tried them all. My 3 Sons only use these Grips. Comfortable, Grip is perfect and they look awesome on any bike and a lot of color choices, Believe me. Get them !!
B0045T4PP8|5|Very nice. Easy to installer.
B00KTJ0EA8|1|Wrong part the key only.
B00OGA8Q38|4|I really like this deck brush. The soft bristles are great for the hull, while the stiff bristles get the blood, guts and bait off the deck. Should work great on my RV as well.
B0048FH2SQ|5|Great product fit exactly right
B00ONH06I2|5|great
B00374PEKC|5|Floormats are great and looks good in my car.
B002KCKQZU|5|This a great product , I wouldnt expect any thing less from k&n !! I am a firm believer in u get what u pay for and k&n is the best !!!.....theres better throttle response and better gas mileage ......all my vehicle get K&n , not junk knock offs 👍
B00X668OGM|4|Outstanding look nice.
B009X1XDZG|5|Easy install.  Seem to be working great so far.  Installed in jeep wrangler tj
B00JJ9AZ26|5|I bought this one by mistake, but it looks like good quality.
B00JYX1WEW|5|replace my with not problem
B006OQ35GU|5|Good quality
B012Y82YOA|3|I am actually using this for myself on the drivers side window as my commute is long and the PM sun shines in perfect alignment of my face and arm.  The heat is minimally reduced but it blocks the rays off my face.  My prime objective.  The annoying part about this, when you remove it from the window, the suction cups fall off too causing me to dig them out from wherever they fall.  (floor, under the seat, in between the seats)
B00U7LUVSI|5|Item was exactly what I needed. This made washing car parts much easier.
B003CSLLHS|5|Fit exactly as advertised.  Well engineered for personal installation.  It would have only taken me 10 minutes to install on a hoist, but took me an hour on my back in the driveway.
B003TQIIPG|5|great stuff .Did the bottom of my rockers 90 sub.Layed it on thick 40psi..........EXELENT
B00Q5E4LV4|1|Useless
B003DMFDM2|4|Came without one part threaded. Company offered to replace or discount. We wanted it now, so we bought a tool and dye kit to thread it ourselves. Otherwise it's a really handsome solid product.
B00H1ES6S6|4|they fit my camper very well( twice cheaper than Camper world..)
B009W85OUC|5|My daughter loved this for her old chevy truck, and she especially loved the pocket in the front.  Too bad she was too short and couldn't reach the pedals so we had to sell the truck.
B00B0C18B2|3|Great price for what you get.  No issues so far, but I only just installed them.  Fit my 2006 DTS  UPDATE: Am actually getting very loud vibrations/groaning with these rotors...have to confirm that it is the rotors, but I replaced the brand new brake pads with news ones and the sound actually got worse.  Still have to confirm that it is the rotors, but it is looking like the only culprit possible so I knocked off 2 stars.  If it ends up being the problem, I will knock it to 1 star
B002X6VXL4|5|This thing is amazing. My girlfriends brother has a Sebring (for some reason) and the battery has been having issues. After jumping his car for the third time I thought to myself there has to be a better way. This thing is amazing, it takes a bit to charge up the first time but after that it performs exactly as advertised. One thing to note it does not come with a cable to charge with. But if you have one of this big orange extension cords it works fine.<br /><br />Only thing that would make this better is a place to keep the tips for the air compressor, but not worth taking a star away. If you are looking for jump starters look no more buy this product.
B00T9AGKQ0|5|What an ingenious device. I used it to jump start my car twice and it still holding enough of a charge for about 8 more. It's a must if you camp or hike and park on trailheads where help isn't always convenient. Also works great for charging devices when you are off the grid. Small and laugh as well.
B00DHGEVTK|1|i had more trouble with order then you could imagine. the first set did not fit, cost me$25.00 to return. then even with the color code the second set did not fit had heat the last coil and close it up because it was to big. did this because it would have cost more than the darn<br />spring were worth. would not do again.
B0073J979Q|5|Process great
B00BOFETFC|4|nice inexpensive functional part.<br />my truck was not prewired as some are.<br />the supplied products worked perfectly.<br />the orange color of the dash switch did not quite match the rest.
B004ROOXK8|5|LOOKS NICE
B00AQZB0V2|5|Works just the way it's supposed to
B00AZXAZE8|5|The spark plug is well built.  It was able to be adjusted with an appropriate amount of tension (there should be a goldi-locks amount of resistense).  It is being used for a trimmer.  I had assumed (incorrectly) that obtaining a replacement locally would have been easy.  I am happy that they carried this at an inexpensive cost on Amazon.
B0031BUH1M|2|I was disappointed with this seat and returned it. No problems with order fulfillment and delivery and return. The seat angle is not much changed from stock and still pushed me forward too much. Also, I wasn't impressed with the build quality as the seat cover didn't last down on the padding in all areas. That's what you get with a mass produced seat. I went back to the Corbin seat instead.
B00E1HX8HK|5|By far the best LED work light I have purchased. This is used on the rear of my New Holland L553 skid steer. Very well made and it includes decent hardware.
B00A2OBW24|5|Worked perfectly in my daughters car. She has an 97 Toyota Tercel, nice little starter car for a teenage driver. She loves the covers.
B008EJSBUU|3|These are ok, but nothing great for the price.
B003RXRPRS|1|I purchased this item a good while back (just figured out how to leave a review.) I took this to the dealer and a locksmith and was informed by both that it is the wrong type of metal. I was skeptical at first and has the locksmith show me and sure enough, the machine was having an incredible hard time cutting this key. I wouldn't suggest buying.
B004I0MYW0|5|Awesome product!!! I bought to replace my foggy OEM on a 94 K1500, and increased visibility for a good 50-100 feet (low-high) from what I had. Easy to install and adjust, and even came brand new in its own box! I would recommend over the $70+ auto part store product any day!
B004M3F56U|5|It has a way of really cleaning the wheels and tire sidewall so that the tire wet you put on later really stays on for a long time. Will order again! GREAT DEAL!
B00MTA8T0M|5|Beautifully crafted, beautiful packaging: simply love it and it came early, added plus  :)
B00LDNKIKU|5|i bought these as an upgrade from 8k to 10k and iv been pleased
B00A9IGU3E|4|Does the job. Color matches great.
B000CPI6VI|4|Works as it should, Great purchase.
B00VSI6HW8|5|Love the stickers thank u
B001VKO8WE|5|Great value, best price I had found.
B000OZS9Y0|4|kinda small for a Can Am Maverick but i made it work.......thanks
B000CEG260|4|Fits pretty well, but has company name screened on the sides of the tips.  I'll polish it off, but wish I didn't have to.
B000VKTULY|4|works
B003SWNVI0|5|Fantastic! Great help in our move across country. I have driven over 4000+ miles with it and am so glad to have it! The straps that come with it are good quality. We had others and didn't need them. If you over pack it things will get wet since the flap over the zipper is important for water resistance. We used vacuum sealing bags to condense our soft items and stuffed them in there so the water was no big deal the first time and the second trip we took we knew better and made sure the flap could cover the zipper - no issues whatsoever on that 1000 mile trip with lots of storms. Just be aware of the dead bugs when you take it off! We now have a very gross memory from the end of our last trip!
B00E0OQG3W|5|Quickly shipped - my brother in law LOVED it ! ! !
B0080JEKIG|5|Works as described
B0055B121U|5|Adapted perfectly on my grand prix gxp.
B00G098NTU|5|Fits perfectly.
B010CUB448|5|Great product and fit great people to buy from very quick and prompt. I would use them again
B001EOWQAS|4|Bolted right on, no problems. Some minor trimming of the plastic flashing was necessary, but that was covered in the installation guide that came with the receiver. A note of caution to those DIY'ers: make sure to thread in and finger tighten all bolts before torquing them. Some antiseize compound does help. Often tightening one side or even one bolt before all are threaded can cause alignment problems. Just a word of advice from a master mechanic!
B00JH1HJXE|5|These actually didn't fit my lugs at all.  However, that was my fault.  These are metric, and my '69 Skylark is obviously not.  So I bought the correct ones (same company, same model... just SAE size) and they work great.  Amazon actually told me these wouldn't fit my Skylark, but I was like &#34;Amazon, you don't know!&#34; And ordered them anyway.  That's just the way I do things sometimes.
B00FFMK17U|5|Very durable and a breeze to install!
B00QN8D27G|5|My cavalier loves it.
B00A7YUIO2|5|works well
B00HUGND6K|5|fun sticker for all zombie aficionados!
B006FLMGGO|5|Great
B00IEL1Z2Y|5|Looks like a decent price
B00LP93NAY|4|Cheap, simple, works.  Probably not for 5 amp plus but ok for a pair of 10 watt led's.  Waterproofness remains to be seen.
B00SWJN378|5|For the price, excellent. Compares to stands twice the price. Please make sure to thread lock both the adjustment bolt and bolt that attaches to kickstand sensor (very important).
B0094DXPDS|5|Great for iPhone users, lag is not an issue for my uses
B000GAN3GC|5|Great price, Amazon rocks
B001FS4TWQ|5|Works great, just as described.
B009F59HR8|1|This hitch is advertised to fit my 2013 Honda CRV but it doesn't.  The arm that extends towards the drivers side of the vehicle needs to be a couple inches longer to have everything line up and have the hitch centered on the vehicle.
B000HS4QA0|5|Really comfortable grip and looks cool and too.
B00FJO7LCW|5|Awesome for my Husband and I  He has problems with his left side and this was a great way to extend the seat belt to make it easier for him to buckle himself in,I usually have to help him, I liked it so much for him seeing the lengthening and less restrictiveness easy access, I bought one for myself. Thank you for being available.
B00AHJZBCG|1|Well, at first my husband and I loved it.  One night while outside the light became dim and started flashing amber.  We came in and I hooked up to the charger per the instructions.  Next morning the light was green.  I unplugged the unit and turned the unit on NOTHING.  Tried charging again with the same result.  I contacted Stanley and was told to contact Baccus Global as they manufacture this under the Stanley name.  Contacted Baccus and received an apology and instructions to call customer service to troubleshoot.  Fine.  I dialed the number and was caller 16 and was placed in cue.  I would get updates about my place in line.  After 30 minutes I was told I was next in line.  Yay!!!  WRONG.  I heard a click and then got the recording &#34;If you would like to make a call please hang up and dial you number.&#34;  Well, I tried again and after 22 minutes.  You guessed it same result.  While writing Baccus Global a scathing letter in regard to this I redialed one last time.  Different this time.  You have reached our office after hours.  Well, I have written Baccus Global making them aware of my review on Amazon!  Next step advise Stanley of the poor service a company manufacturing under their name provides.<br /><br />I'd post a picture, but it's just a dead flashlight.
B0094JJDRE|5|Good buy and is direct fit. Been working fine since install
B00JF283TO|5|Perfect OE replacement.  My furnace was doing the classic start and stop three times then shut down.  This remedied the problem right away and was easy to replace.  Extremely satisfied with it.
B002969BHQ|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B013IKBIZY|5|As described. Color is as shown. Very soft. Stays in place, but still able to slide so belt can retract.
B0029XKO6G|4|Looks good
B000F11LPC|3|Very nice cover, material and stitching, and an excellent fit. However, the color &#34;cocoa&#34; was nowhere near the cocoa color of the car's dash and interior trim (2015 Chevy Cruze). The dashmat was a lighter brown, with a slight reddish tint in the sun, which also reflected quite a bit onto the windshield glass. Wife not happy (her car) so had to return cover.
B00I0FPGE2|4|The install was a breeze and everything fits just fine. You may have to widen some of the holes for the plastic push pins on rear tail though. Took me a few hours to complete btw and you may have to repaint your gas tank depending on your taste.
B000NUCLFO|5|Replaced my old 1998 Ford F150 XLT gas cap perfectly. I purchased this gas cap together with the Dorman 577-903 Fuel Tank Filler Neck. Both work great. My engine light does not come on anymore as a result of a chipped edge on the Filler Neck's opening where the gasoline pump nozzle has been resting from years of fill-ups.
B0024ECIP0|5|Product arrived quickly and exceeded my expectations. Best online price.
B000GBBP84|1|LIES - these do not fit, very disappointed.
B002ZRQ4J2|4|Very satisfied, reasonably priced.  Will it last longer than the others I've used?  To soon to tell.
B00XO0ROKM|5|I just recieved the levers today in the mail. They were delivered much more quickly than expected (3 days). Installation took all of 5 mins. to complete and they look great. The contour and finger knotches are very comfortable and feel better than the stock levers. I was hesitant to purchase online even though it said they would fit my bike (2001 Suzuki Intruder 1500). I am very pleased with the promt delivery, quality of the product, and ease of installation. I recommend these to anyone that wants to spruce up the look of their bike with full funtionality as well.
B00139YMUQ|5|muy bueno
B00OP5CTS2|5|My dad loved it :)
B0085YJG8A|4|Good value in a waterproof jacket. Not useful above 70° or so, unless it's raining. Vents are too small to help much.
B00PC3WCII|1|Did not work for my car. The sockets do not fit my application and when plugged in they get extremely hot so I took them off and threw them on the work bench. They didn't even cancel out the hyper flash on top of all that. Garbage
B002ZBWKAU|1|I bought this b/c of price and good reviews. Started off great with the first car tire.  Inflated it quickly within 2 minutes. Then when I tried the 2nd tire- the unit kept shutting off over and over again. It seems the unit overheats with less than 2min of use. I had to wait four- 5min between tires and by the fourth on it would barely stay on for more than 5seconds even with waiting.  Waste of money and since I didn't use it for a while after getting- I missed the return window.  Don't waste your time or money with this.
B004P1WMDI|5|Excellent product and easy to apply.
B00REQ1TZ8|4|They fit well.
B00KFPDLZQ|4|The light are (ok) not very bright easy to install shipping was fast
B00DX88MB0|5|cool
B00004SQK2|3|They work as advertised.  Nothing amazing but they are nice to have in the trunk
B0022ZJAEI|4|Good soft rubber seal on a metal base, superior to stock Harley product.  Delivered quickly and well packed.  They are fragile compared to the Harley part, and must be handled carefully during installation.  I take the spring off the flange of the seal until the valve is installed to avoid ripping the soft rubber.  Special tool number &#34;old Sportster wristpin&#34; is a good installation aid; if you try to drive it on with a deep socket the points of the socket will tear the rubber.
B000C5UEEA|5|Works great and installed fine.
B00G4AB4MS|5|Excellent loading and function. I ordered additionally a Heininger 6033 Advantage SportsRack 1.25&#34; Threaded Receiver Trailer Lock and Master Lock 2866DATSC Swivel Head Receiver Lock, Chrome - Now it is secure and rattle free.
B00QIHC0G6|5|Ordered it as a gift, and the recipient loves it!
B0050514SW|5|Now this is a plug! Lots of  people don't know this, but there can be a few bad plugs in a batch. Before replacing everything else, try a new plug. I pull mine often, just to see the engines health status. Fuel, air, compression, spark..red light ,green light..are you ready to roll?
B000AL8VD2|5|Seems pretty good.  I slobbered it around my tail light wires and into the sockets. I've always had water problems on that car. Check back with me a year from now.  So far so good.  It looks like heavy grease but it doesn't stop the electricity from reaching the light bulbs.
B0010DXYH2|5|Fits my 2010 Impala perfectly and takes about 5 minutes to install. Great price here on Amazon!
B00HJDJIEA|5|After much searching to find a fix for the rotten air tube on my 91 VW cabby I found this tubing. It is much more than I needed but can use the rest for other projects. It even taps well when I needed to add a 3/4&#34; port
B00B51ZXNW|5|GREAT FIT AND COLOR MATCH
B00JFDK77O|5|very good as posted.
B000C91AJY|4|These walkers are basic exhausts -- not a high-quality finish. If there were more welding on the hanger it would make me feel more comfortable that it wasn't going to crack and fall off. But its otherwise a solid piece.<br /><br />When my engine was on the engine stand I checked the fit of the walker. It fit perfectly. (If it doesn't fit for you, it was probably bent in shipping.) However the overlap of the flare onto the exhaust manifold is only, say, 1mm --- tiny --- so you have to make dead certain the flare is centered or the flare will butt-up instead of overlapping.<br /><br />To install you HAVE TO REMOVE THE TRANSMISSION MOUNT. If you don't, then you will have to bend the walker to get it in -- a bad idea. Once the transmission mount is back in and tightened up, but BEFORE you tighten up the Cat, do the fit onto the manifold.<br /><br />Make absolutely sure both sides' mating onto the manifold is perfectly centered before you start tightening. Use anti-cease on the bolts to make sure they tighten smoothly. I went way over the FSM torque spec for those bolts.<br /><br />On one side the bolt of the upper control arm sticks out too far and gets in the way. Grind that down flush with the nut. I removed that bolt and put in a spring washer and some flat washers -- instead of grinding -- but it was hard to get the bolt out and back in again because of the compression on the control arm.<br /><br />For manifold-to-exhaust bolts I used a straight piece of modelling spring wire to make a Nut Holder to get the one nut in behind the flare. You can't get your hand in there to thread the nut -- no space.
B002QEV34K|5|I think this stuff works as good as the well known brand...  and the price point is amazing.
B008P19PLQ|5|The view is limited but they look nice on my ek. All you got to do its just custumise the wires to make it work but for the price cant complaint.
B000C7W3QK|1|Beware. Does NOT fit the Super Beetle as advertised.
B00CPO8204|5|I like this plate. It is well made. It looks great, everyone loves to take pics with it.
B000DINKPQ|5|Excellent horn very loud.
B00029WXVI|5|Nice fit in the valve covers. Wasn't expecting it to be so large but adds color to my red and black set up for my sbc 355
B001QGDWF2|5|These liftgate supports installed very easily and have worked great. I would order them again.
B002ITUFMY|5|This is a great deal. My only comment is to put lock-tite on the end threads so you don't lose the cap like I did. Works amazingly well as long as you don't care if your drink gets warm or cold... depending on the air temp.
B0001XPC04|5|I bought this so my girlfriend can do her makeup in the car (thereby saving time).  It works well for its intended purpose.  I haven't had any issues so far.
B00LBZ7A10|3|Radio still won't bring in weak signal stations
B00D9C2CDO|4|This actually worked very very well for our trip from IL to FL. we used extra straps as suggested  & had no problems.
B000E4SMH0|5|Fit was good, works perfect
B00NS1IA78|5|Haven't assembled it yet, but it's very well finished and light.
B001B5DO4C|5|My car shifts like butter now.
B004O7DBM4|5|Excellent product. Works perfectly. Installation took only 15 minutes.
B00G3TLWTU|5|Great sticker - shipped quickly - THANKS
B001FAGLAM|5|Fan-frickin'-tastic
B00W300O3I|2|Despite coming with no directions, it is easy enough to figure out what to do. The mounting system is nearly impossible to keep from sliding on the roof of the car. After securing it with the help of three people, the rack still slide when supporting a luggage carrier.
B00B9FCYAE|5|Good quality and perfect fit, very happy with this product.
B000BD6NF2|1|The description, clearly does not do a very good job of identifying the size.  length, especially.
B002NOI990|5|perfect
B00GN0VBHW|2|Not accurate
B010MSADJW|5|Really well made and very fast shipping - thanks.
B000CSINYK|5|Great filter set.
B000BZJ532|5|Perfect replacement for the 7mm wires in my '72 BMW. They're Bosch, so you know they're great quality!
B004EIDD2Q|5|Ok
B000E9Z49Y|5|I try to keep this in my car cleaning kit (a bucket of stuff in the trunk) but this item always disappears on me. Seems it is real good for stuff around the house as well.  Gonna have to hide the next one I order.
B000OV5IQQ|5|Works as advertised. Excellent
B007TV5L98|5|My girlfriend loved it, it looks great, and it was easy to install.
B00AT7D4QQ|5|exactly as advertised.
B00JPZFB14|5|Awesome addition at a great price...perfect fit.  It was the only side of the car missing chrome trim.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Product arrived quickly and works well.
B00P2D3VZG|5|Great bulb.  Bright!
B000IYTMSE|5|fit on my 2007 Chevy Colorado perfectly.

B00JCHNDVA|1|Decal. Cheap quality. Won't last if ur in a state w hot, regular sunshine.
B000B6CW1S|1|Broke in a month
B004OOJ9RI|1|According to OTC tech this does not cover airbags SRS or ABS Better check with them (OTC) before ordering.
B00EPRAHAC|5|Look great, easy to install.
B009XRNSPU|2|so small can not use it anywhere it will be seen when applied looks like a spot of grey
B00RW67X1O|4|FITS GOOD
B009ZXCSO4|5|used in my car and worked well. Put on 10-year-old leather bag, and looks like new
B00AZMBF3O|1|The part that arrived in the box was NOT a 903-015RS strut.  It was not as the picture depicted nor as the part number indicated.  / realize this isn't an amazon/vendor foul up, but be aware in case you have the truck torn down like I did, expecting to be able to get it back together as soon as your parts arrive.
B00353PWAW|5|a great price for something that I don't have to use more than a couple ounces of and it makes my Black Silverado look brand new. I wash my truck every other week and this costs and works a lot better than getting it don't at a drive-thru car wash.
B006CN9FNM|4|Everything you need to do a DSG oil change on a 2013 Golf TDI. Only needed 5 of the oil bottles. Everything looks to be OEM VW. Also bought a funnel to pour the oil in through the oil filter housing.
B00VSWTJME|5|I WILL SAY THIS WORKED FOR TWO DIFFERENT RIGS, AFTER THE oem was either too hard to find or too expensive. the wiper itself broke during install, because you see the chinese factory did not put the larger pieces together...i was able to use the arm, and an older wiper together and a zip tie to make it all work.  I will say, when I complained about the breaking, they gave me a refund no ?'s asked.
B000E3XIPM|1|This cap was a complete failure, we use our hands to close it and it leak.  We use a crimping tool and did a fair force to close it.  Still leak, We then when and did a more powerful lock and it still leak.  It was so tightly close that we had to hammer it to get it out.  This was use on a diesel tank and it sure didn't sum up to our expectation.  Complain to Amazon and a return is been process.
B00VGL7LG8|5|Very well built.
B000C55ZBM|5|Great product, clearly a quality made product versus the other 'cheap' options on the market, also easy to install and comes with everything you need, impressed!
B000CMJ6RY|2|I haven't installed it yet. It has a less than stella fit for the A post.
B003WZRLZ2|5|Works great
B00WW3C6ZA|5|Very nice bright bulb and gives my tail lights a deeper red color.
B00DLMNWB8|1|did not work

B005CDYB64|1|Ordered a Decepticon emblem, got an Autobot emblem. Enough said.
B000C9DV8C|5|Excellent.
B00877TP4K|5|Exactly as listed!
B00OO1KJ66|5|It fit perfectly
B000U0Z2L2|3|The metal lips on the plug-ins can cause sparks if in contact with the battery.
B000J4NM7U|4|Excellent much easier
B000C9I8PS|5|Exact item that I needed, and quick delivery
B000CO880S|5|Looks good.

B001JT5JVQ|5|As promised.  Great product!
B002PK2TD4|4|worked as stated
B003CXJWHO|5|Perfect fit!  Well made.
B00IEL2TNI|2|I have a convertible VW beetle.  I purchased these covers and they don't fit.  I didn't return because I tore one at the top trying to get it over the seat back.  The bottom cushions don't fit either.  Poor purchase on my part.
B00RGXMH64|2|covers the state name on your license plate.
B00SF3U9W8|5|Used in a 95 ford ranger.  Bright as hell. Highly recommend. Is kind of loose on the housing however that is the only down side.
B006G14FK8|5|I can't believe how the profile of a quality automotive battery charger has changed over the decades.<br />Thus, it was a little hard for me to believe initially that this little guy would actually do what it says, and also mostly eliminate the need for my giant traditional chargers with lots of heft from copper transformers and metal casings.<br />But, horn my swaggles, it sure has done so.<br />I can now carry it easily in one of my cars, and can loan it very cleanly to neighbors and friends in it's neat little carrying bag and the original box I saved.<br />The &#34;refurb&#34; mode has pulled a couple of questionable batteries back from what I presumed was the brink.<br />And I use to to give old computer UPS batteries a final goose to make them last just a smidge longer, but would not do so for any critical installation of same.<br />I liked my so well that I bought one as a gift for my older brother who has scads of cars and motorcycles (Ah, the country joys of having multiple barns . I have urban envy.) He like it a lot after a few months.<br />If I get another one, I wil go the next step larger and get one that also has the ability to be used in &#34;boost' mode for starting.<br />THis has been a VERY good buy for me!
B00IO2COKA|4|Not as bright as I anticipated. Used in a 95 ford ranger.
B004L6AAUE|5|I like it
B005GYDBNS|5|Coming up on 7,000 miles and no noticeable power loss.
B0000AYF5H|5|Plugged right in with no problems
B001RLS1SE|5|works very good
B00HEZQHTM|3|First time using in my diesel. Didn't see any improvement like I see when using Lucus
B00Z89I2OY|5|Love these.  Easy to install. My niece is looking for some and I recommended these to her.  I did notice I paid 19.99 for these a few weeks ago and now they are 14.99:(  Great price too!
B00KXOF332|1|Too dark didn't even match my car and now I have a huge dark spot on my car
B00JIHC36K|5|Very bright lights. I just placed them on the front side markers of my car and look cool and brihgt.
B009F09SYU|4|Can't tell if there's any improvement, but car still holds tight,its a Vette....???
B00Z7KIZPA|2|This item only fits cars that have consoles that open.  My Lexus 350's console slides back.  I was very disappointed that it didn't fit.  I returned it.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Love this unit. We use it mainly to power our tablets but I love knowing a jump start is not dependant on someone having to help me out.  It is holding charge and we haven't had any issues in the two months we've had it.
B00NEX77WO|1|The title clearly states that it has no tabs and that this product is ready for install but that is completely false advertising.  As others have stated, the tabs are still on the emblem and you will have to remove them yourself.  Not sure how they are allowed to get away with this clearly misleading description.
B00CUL7CU8|5|There is not much to say about this replacement antenna mast . It came in screwed in without issue and receives excellent signal . It was extremely easy to install
B002P8QWOS|1|The mirrors look fine but only move side to side, not in four directions
B008HZMP30|5|My first disk break job. No complains
B000CKJLA8|1|after using the make sure they fit app...they didn't
B00AKJ2QZS|5|dropped right in no issues
B00MADMZ30|5|THIS LOOKS GOOD ON MY RZR
B001GC2LVM|3|Was working very well for us until this last weekend when we pulled off to leave and one of the leverlers broke in half. We only used it about 6 times. They are suppose to be under warranty so we'll see what we can do to get some satisfaction out of this. Otherwise a good idea.
B007HH7ARU|5|Aweome. Saved $45 by purchasing from JVMax over the OEM list price for a new antennae. Better reception, as well. As easy to install as a light bulb.
B00BYWZW1U|5|I got this put on my truck Saturday in about 2.5 to 3 hours the instructions were ok and the reference pictures are a little hard to see being in black and white, there are some You Tube video's of similar products that helped me with my install that I recommend watching during your install, but once I got it all installed it sounds and runs great. I could tell right away it had a little more punch and quicker response on the throttle, I would recommend this to anyone trying to improve the performance of their truck and it's half the price of K&N
B000XEBI9K|5|Just installed it on my 2004 Honda Accord, but so far, so good!
B001RZ62L8|5|Nice product A+
B007QXH98U|5|Working perfect!
B008X72XV6|5|Looks good!
B0047Z2R6Y|5|Good hydration pack. Fast delivery.
B005D4AHSS|5|Installed in under 2 minutes in my wife's 2015 pathfinder. At first I thought they were defective but I just tightened the connectors and it worked.  Color is accurate, they're a good build it seems, great packaging as anyone would tell you here. They also followed up to make sure I installed these successfully. That's great customer service! You just got a new customer here. Def recommend to all my friends.
B00M0D4FU6|1|Once dies almost immediately... Poor quality!
B00KNSIFJW|5|Great working lights. I used them on my camper. Hooked them to the battery with a switch. Now if I arrive late to a campsite I just turn them on and can see clear what is behind me. Once camped they work great as night lights for pathway and work lights. Super bright.
B00SN7KX54|5|They do the job
B00TOSYP14|5|Put this on the back window of my jeep!! Looks great !!
B0000C6F6L|5|Handle arrived quickly and works to my expectations. Saved me from replacing the whole unit!
B007BF5OJO|5|Used it this weekend at a very dusty ATV, item worked great
B000TGM7HY|5|These tools are amazing!!! An absolute for anyone who has to use a tap. Much easier using a ratchet than a tap handle. I shattered my wrist and don't have much strength in it so using a ratchet really helps. Also works great with a drill when using a 3/8 adapter but, it prevents the tap from spinning in drill chuck. All around great tool. I highly recommend buying one!
B00LCFKRSC|5|Perfect addition to update my son's new car!  Well made, installed easy, looks great.
B004SL4ZT4|5|Fit the Prius 2008.
B001TAPLYA|4|Very good headlights needed a little adjustment
B00EER3LCE|1|Mislableled and does not fit my bike as advertised!
B004C444UM|5|Fits fine and looks great
B00GHT4IDI|5|Thanks Big A, it fit as an OEM Balancer and the price was Great!!
B000BGOFL8|5|good buy.
B00252928M|5|Good quality oem filter
B001SL9LL4|5|I got this for my 2012 scion as I did not care for the original leather steering cover. It works great in the cold or hot days. Thank you.
B000C9DR4K|5|Great for my 2006 Galant
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|This one is the one to get I've bought the 60 70 80 dollar jumpers this one's the real deal spend the extra doe don't waste you money and buy the same thing twice. I have a E350 van with 7.3 and this thing has saved me and works great.<br /><br />Plus you can charge just about anything that has usb charger cell table laptop huge bonus.
B008A34GXQ|5|right part in a timely manner
B005VMPN9U|1|I would never waste money on an OEM Chrysler jeep windshield. Mine rotted from the inside out from the factory the whole bottom of the frame was rust dust and was decimated. My windshield was never lowered and the seals were not tampered with. When I took mine off for an unrelated install of another product I was unable to reinstall it due to the dammage on the bottom of the frame. There was not indication that this was a problem untill I removed the frame. I consider my self lucky had I not discovered this when I did the rust would have spread to the firewall and the body. My jeep is otherwise rust free and in great condition. These windshield frames are pure junk, save the money but a 300$ frame from china and have it coated from the inside out with a rust proofer, or consider them to highly disposable part of the jeep. This is the first time I have every been let down by my jeep.
B000GV9XD8|5|Fantastic item and price!!!
B00IZNQ2IS|5|Bought both sides for my 850 fit like a charm! Great product and they gave me a combined shipping rate.  Very happy! Thanks again!
B000CKR24U|4|Not the right part but works with mod...
B00JAHBXH8|5|They are great the fit wonderful and exceeded my expectations
B001BDJY5M|3|Super cute, it just covered up a lot of my license plate numbers. Sadly had to return.
B00804CK6U|4|Worked good.
B000W0RQ8C|5|Fits on my 2002 avalanche
B0006H8AEK|4|They're not as stable as I thought, but do the job needed.
B0049MKQD6|5|Part was as described. Satisfied customer
B0049LU5H4|5|Perfect replacement for IH-Navistar pn 355186C1. less than 1/2 the dealer price. Just need to use the plastic diverter from O.E. filter Also replaces pn 3551814C1 exactly
B00UVXDIS2|5|Easy to apply and look great
B00S209SMG|5|Well made and adds a nice thought when they are seen
B009XIDO30|4|4 stars as it looks great.  If you want a windshield to provide wind protection, this does not provide any protection.
B00BVX0MJ4|5|Works well at night and well made.
B004EIAADG|1|One star does not begin to express my disappointment. Bought the unit 1 yr ago. I tested it out with my CPAP machine before heading out on a camping trip. It worked fine so we headed out. One hour into the first night it quit working.  Once home I called customer service to arrange for warranty replacement. I was told there was nothing wrong with unit and that they are NOT to be used with CPAP machines because of surges. I got a 12 volt adapter for my CPAP, did another test night running on the DC side. It worked so I assumed problem solved. The unit has resided on the shelf under my work bench ever since. Every 4-6 weeks I plug it in overnight just to be sure it’s topped off. I just happened to recharge it last Tuesday and how fortunate it was because we had a windstorm yesterday and lost our power for almost a full day.  About 8:30 pm  I attempted to plug in a 60 lamp . It wouldn’t work. Unit started buzzing. Changed the bulb from CF to incandescent. Still nothing and then it started beeping and all kinds of numbers coming up on the read-out. The good news was that it did manage to charge my wife’s I-phone on the usb port.  A $100+ phone charger is not what I ordered and now the warranty is up and I’m stuck with this garbage.
B00EUVYRC2|5|Great deal on the light-love it.
B002OKKCO8|5|Ok
B00DX8CGLW|5|Very nice product very satisfied seems to be top quality
B007OXCIB0|2|Junk vinyl...period. The carbon fiber pattern is nice on this vinyl but what renders this vinyl useless is the adhesive. Once the sun beats down in this vinyl the adhesive shows its lack of bond. Tried this stuff on a few different parts on my vehicle, interior and exterior and its has not held. Not much else to say about this stuff other that check out a different product or spend a little more for a brand name.
B00GRHRTEU|5|Solid product..does not vibrate or shake unless doing 90+ mph. Simple install takes about 15 minutes.
B002R4U7G4|5|Great product! I wrapped bellowed up pipes that I installed on my truck, and so far, they have worked as designed. It is also a bit quieter in the cab than it used to be, which was an added bonus.
B00OZXP3BY|5|This product fit perfectly and was a great price. Can't wait to try out how it performs in rain in snow.
B005FKXE5S|5|Good quality product, fit perfectly.  They stop great no noise at all.  I definitely would buy again for all my cars.
B00OCCS3UG|5|Great
B00HVON60Y|5|Original OEM replacement. You will need to order two because the car requires two side by side filters.
B000M5Y72A|5|Brighter then OEM
B00HIVHAJ8|5|Excellent product - super high quality.  better than OEM
B009WDYRGO|5|Seems like a very high quality product. Hopefully it will last as long as the original!
B001C5O9P4|2|They work good but my glasses come off when taking off the googles and to many holes in googles let's to much dirt in.
B00GBVHQB8|3|on the small side.  i wear a larg american glove this was just right for my wifes hand.  She thanks you for such a nice pair of gloves.  and now i have to order myself a pair. :)
B00MYHE13Y|5|I have a Suburban with a large seat and the strap stretches to fit nicely. No matter which product you purchase, make sure it has a top AND a bottom strap.  The top is a nice length and adjustable.  The bottom is made of elastic.  I wish this was around when my children were younger, but it works great for all ages.  Thankful to have found it.
B000182BDK|4|works well
B00L40ZQGS|5|Quiet fan with good air flow.
B00NAGBMFI|1|Poor quality graphic - fuzzy and not well printed.
B004CP40LE|5|Working well after one year.  Good buy
B00EE8K4XM|5|Fit perfectly around every nook and cranny and are way tougher than the &#34;tough&#34; mats that came with the all weather package of the subaru.
B000C02TG6|5|You have all parts needed for the front caliper.
B001W0JOS6|5|Replaced this part on my 2008 GMC Envoy (had a fault code for the secondary air system) in about 15 minutes. reset the computer and the fault code has never returned so it seems to have fixed the problem.
B00HD50BEK|1|Crap.. don't get I only got it for the few extra bucks for free shipping.
B00V5YPFKU|5|I kept dropping objects (credit cards, cash and phone mostly ) which would get stuck between the seat and the console. This would necessitate an awkward grab on my knees in the footwell of the backseat.<br />I easily slid the ChiTronic Gap Fillers in the seat/console gap from the back a few weeks ago.  I haven't dropped anything since then. I'd say they worked like a charm.
B007VHBGIU|1|This is not a direct fit for either the tailgate or grill of the F150 King Ranch (2007), as stated in the description. It is not metal, nor is it secured with nuts like the original....this one is completely plastic, and is a self adhesive mount.
B01312UIOQ|5|[[VIDEOID:e65b752aadda27471bb1b1f1858f184d]]Wow what a fabulous idea, these are perfect for so many things .These are a must for everyone , to shade your windows .<br />These are positively the best window shades, they give far more protection then any other window shade.<br />We have tried so many different ones, they either don't give full coverage or they fall down .<br />These are perfect because they go right over the door , giving you complete coverage .<br />These keep every bit of sun off your children , the other awesome bonus of these is you can actually roll the window down and still have shade.<br />We have found another wonderful use for these too.When we go to the drive-in movies, we use them as mosquito shields .<br />With these we can keep our windows open and keep the bugs out, what a fabulous product .<br />I love these and will now never use another car shade , but we do need a few more for the drive-in .<br /><br />I highly recommend these great window shades ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B0096BH8NQ|5|Fit perfectly and shipped fast
B000IBDIX2|1|Kbs coating ruined my fuel tank. It peeled off in about 5 months. Do not use this product.
B000EQR5YE|5|Fast shipping. Easy to install and works well.
B00P6OL6U8|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B004ME5ZTQ|5|These lifted rails saved my truck bed of any damage. Well worth the price paid!
B003TTL0TE|5|Holds a lot of water.  Allows a lot of washing between trips back to the bucket.
B000CIPUU0|4|This is a very good option to buying tons of the aerosol cans. It works just as well as the cans at the store when put in a sprayer/dispenser. The only complaint I would have is that it isn't any cheaper than finding a really good deal on the aerosol cans anywhere else. If it were cheaper than buying cans I would definitely give it a full five starts.
B00DWVNYJ8|5|I bought these for my new Toyota Tacoma TRDsport these fit perfectly and added a great touch these are genuine Toyota products
B00PMKHF0G|5|arrived when and as should have
B007V2WZZS|5|Huge diffrence
B00JS8TLP0|5|Good. As described.
B0006MEHQ0|5|First impression was this flexes way too much for my liking.  I have used them hundreds of times and they are solid all and all too load and unload the 4 wheeler. They fold small enough for me to slide them under the ATV, and not really take up any additional truck bed space.  You can't beat the price, and quality of the product. The only thing I would say is you might not want to use these for anything over a 400cc quad.  My buddy's 400 really pushes the weight capacity of these ramps.
B00E5VXI5E|5|fast shiping  i like it
B00IWLDEVG|5|Good
B00EA0ZB7I|4|my son said they were perfect
B00H7HZVP8|1|It was supposed to be for my 2013  ford escape instead I got one for a Kia

B00BFDGJB0|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.
B0091QKW6Q|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B004HCM9H4|5|I used this to wax the inside of my acrylic shower. It was put in when we built our home 20 years ago. The shower no longer had much of a finsh after daily use. It now shines and the water just slides off! I am not sure if I will use it on our cars, but for the shower-it is great! It is holding up against the lime in our water which clogs everything and makes it hard to clean.
B00EAJD8E2|5|Connector fit perfectly and worked great for cleaning 2010 Chevrolet Malibu injectors.
B008EEYMMG|5|Top quality product at a very reasonable price with great shipping turn around.
B004HZC5NO|4|From the picture the mat looks black but when my brother received it for his birthday it was gray. Looking back at my order it did say it was gray. I should have check the details before I ordered but I wish the picture matched the description to cut back on the confusion.
B001MY0ULC|5|prompt delivery, pretty much what I expected
B011W8KOOA|5|I must have a hundred or more screw driver and socket  heads, but this is very handy for a basic project.  The quality is very good for the price and when I needed to drive a screw all the way in to finish a project it did the job where a driver just slipped.  The rubber holder keeps it all together and I put it in a small plastic dish to make a set I can find when I need it.  The metal seems to be of good quality and the handle is well made.  All in all, very good value for the cost.
B003L35990|5|Just as I expected. Good delivery
B00029XGIM|2|Was not louder than the horn I replaced but the tone was definitely more noticeable.  Unfortunately, the horn stopped working in less than two months.  Very disappointed.
B000VU9A28|5|Good item, good price, great service.
B004K9FT9Y|5|great
B002O6WACO|5|As advertised, shipped promptly, fit perfectly.
B00JIBFMY6|5|Haven't had to use it yet, thankfully... But the product does appear to be a nice, heavy duty item.
B009SIO9ZW|5|Easy install, works great...
B0019SVYMK|5|Love It
B00E8I1NXS|5|This license plate holder looks really nice on my new black convertible.  It just adds a nice touch when added to the big &#34;5.0&#34; more the back of the car.
B0049Z6W3G|5|installation on my 2007 chevy Colorado was super easy. Great part!
B008SR1QIW|4|very well constructed.
B005CQ691Q|5|It a universal part, comes with rubber bungees that fit right over my 41mm shock tubes. Turn signals are bulb number 194 so I changed them out for leds but they only flash they don't have a wire for running lights, which isn't a problem for my set up, all in all great looking light, fits good, fair lighting at night, but not a good night headlight just not bright enough, I ride in the day and afternoon so this hasn't been a problem for me. Hope the review helps
B00WQHMMVK|2|I bought this product to keep my car organized and my kids entertained by having all their things in front of them. Unfortunately the product does not actually look like the picture. The bottom portion does not enclose, it is just a flap on the outside and you slide the tissue box inside. This is a huge problem as soon as you start driving and things move around the tissue box falls out. This flap has Velcro that you are supposed to attach to the top to create a secure place to slide the tissue box but the problem is the flap isn't long enough. If you pull it high enough to reach the Velcro then the bottom strap that wraps around the front seat gets in the way.<br /><br />Poorly designed product.
B00DJC5Q0U|4|Great product, looks good. Heavy duty.
B004BWU8H8|1|Was assured that it would fit into my 2011.  Absolutely will not fit.  Not pleased.
B006CSP2PC|4|It is a 3 button key and it worked...
B002N5W8Q4|3|Pain to install/remove batteries.
B0002SRFOE|5|These are great.  They hold the taps perfectly and work like a champ!
B005BWIA1I|5|Worked perfectly for my 05 Elantra! Thank you, for saving me a small fortune!
B00NY3ZWTE|5|Fits great, easy install.
B002AHKZ10|5|Love this keychain.
B00FPR1SXG|5|Love this stuff smell great. This scent will make your car smell great.<br />Looks real good in a jdm car.
B000C982B8|5|Not much to say here: plugs have been working fine after gapping and capping about a year ago.  Broke my distributor cables trying to remove a boot from an old plug and tried to fix that myself with some solder.  I've done smarter things than that before.  Make sure to be careful with your wires, lest you wind up on 5 cylinders.
B008UF9NBO|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B008AZJ6RU|5|Great can.
B00LXLKF6O|5|People either think I'm cool or super dorky with this in my window.
B0013TNMY8|5|awesome product & very fast shipping thanks
B003YMVOII|5|Great
B00PSQ7JO6|5|Very good brakes.
B002DTV172|4|waterproof a big plus.  good value charger
B0036GNSGS|4|amazing product heavy duty, only thing it has no kill switch when the alarm goes off you need to unlock it to kill the alarm.
B0099V02EA|5|This was exactly what I needed.
B00HSTX274|5|nice quality stuff; -good price, prompt delivery.
B00QBQ9URQ|5|nice looking product
B00YB5GAEA|1|Got one of these because a) compact, b) USB rechargeable and therefore better for sustainability and c) simple and lightweight design. Satisfactory light output. Upon second charge, the whole thing came apart - the USB charger cable stuck in the port and pulled the innards out of the light.<br />Fixed that, it got mad at me and didn't charge at all. Plus, the innards must've grown so that not everything fits into the light again without forcing it.<br /><br />So now I am sitting with a light in pieces that will not (would not) charge.<br /><br />There went 20 wasted bucks. Too bad, it's really a neat idea,
B001XOVIQM|4|They do there job........... Nice that they match the wooden cupboard
B00HA26HZS|4|It does exactly what it is supposed to & it looks good doing it.<br />My only issue is that since it is 2 separate pieces, getting a good alignment wasn't easy.<br />Though I don't blame the seller or the product for that.
B000E283S0|3|Ok if you don't care about how your engine compartment looks.  this stuff wrinkles like crazy and does not do bends well at all.
B000GVGHNC|5|Is there better?  I don' think so.
B00DTEGGJS|3|It appears that the service life for this item is limited to a couple of riding seasons at best, depending on weather and temperature conditions. Make sure you have a spare.
B000M8RYUE|5|great lube
B002UC6W0S|5|While I wasn't especially fond of the process of replacing this seal, it was needed and worked well.
B0049HKFIM|5|Exactly as advertised...
B004VRLGU6|5|love the stuff it great in my vehicle and it last a long time compared the ones you buy at the store,
B00KTLA8FM|5|Genuine products its always better. I recomend
B00G8EXK3G|3|Looks and works great, but I have to beat it on with a hammer.
B000EDSSG6|5|After sitting for four months in storage with the grey tank valve open, the valve was extremely dry and hard to operate.  I poured about 4 oz. down the sink drain followed by about 3 gallons of water.  As the treated water ran through the valve I operated it.  Within 3 stokes the valve was operating smoothly again.  This is wonderful stuff and I recommend it to everyone.
B008ZE1GXS|5|Best
B00T7C8VVM|5|Great product, fit just like it was suppose to and looks great
B000ONZQLG|5|fits fine, fair price
B00498ZROS|4|The coil springs arrived in good condition, apart from a few areas where the paint was chipped.  They seem to be handling well since the installation.
B00EXXRYO0|5|Great Tire! Just as described in order!! Very happy!
B009MATEPG|5|Fits perfect on my 2014 Sprinter Van!!!
B00J6311O6|5|Excellent product, very pleased. Highly recommend.
B00493S6CS|5|works great. This one was slightly longer than my 2007 chevy Colorado stock switch, but of course the plug was the same and the mount position is adjustable.
B00ZR7WLEE|5|Massive light output, well over twice the light of 921 bulbs, and very easy to install.  Price was much less than competitors, appearance is as good or better, and completes my replacement of all fixtures in my 5th wheel with LEDs.  I highly recommend the 4000-4500 kelvin color range.  The first 2 LED pancake lightsI purchased were in 2700-3000 Kelvin range and just do not put out the light these do (and they were over $50 each several years ago at a RV store).
B0009IBJE4|5|It was able to revive my car battery with no problems!
B006W3ZB08|3|They are super cute on her helmet, but they don't like to stay on the helmet.  One of them falls off frequently and they are only 1 month old.
B004K8UY72|5|Works just as it should.
B00S5TBXZ4|2|Way too big for my SUV windshield.
B00KZC60KC|5|I'm in love with these light bars they work great but did have to make different brackets to fit it on my light bar .
B00N6QGQWG|5|Great cover. Exactly as advertised. Fits perfect
B00FO6Q6E4|5|funny!
B00O802YF2|5|Fast shipping and great quality. A+!
B00FMB3W34|3|Excellent service very happy with the merchandise
B00W47NSYM|4|Works great for I needed, to patch some cheaper faux-elater chairs in a dark rock.  Doesn't stick as much as I would like, and needs to be cut with scissors for a clean edge, but it does the job.
B00L4TF32G|5|Awesome stuff
B005QPE7UI|5|Great  awesome brakes
B00JRE38EA|5|Very bright and runs much cooler than incandescents. Probably need to get some dimmer ones so my license plate isn't blindingly bright at night!
B0094MG0VI|5|i applied the sticker using the wet application. i diluted a few drops of soap in a spray bottle with water. it took a few hours to sets it the sun. but its looks great so far
B008PAJCRE|5|Delivery was very fast, easy to install, and is a great improvement over the stock air shocks.  Now I'm replacing the fork suspension with progressive mono tube inserts.
B0040DC3LM|5|They work very well
B0089OWUW0|5|Great quality...Do not use the screw caps however, They collect moisture and will rust your fasteners. Instead go to hardware and buy some stainless fasteners for a couple bucks.
B00FKW7USI|5|Fits great on our 2014 Sportsman 550.
B00RQS7QWY|1|Its broken already, the remote worked one day and broke down, very cheap
B009W3Q4RO|5|Just as described. OEM for a better price then and local shop.
B006ZAPDO2|5|Nice an sturdy!
B001UEJK8S|5|Can fix your brake lights staying on problem. I didn't need it because I found out my clip was just missing instead, so amazon returned it no problems.
B00BJHQG0Q|1|Do not use on your pets it made my dog extremely sick for a week . I have a very active Chesapeake and he would not eat, his eyes had this green goo running out and all he would do was sleep . &#34;DO NOT BUY&#34;
B000CQFPHK|1|When I ordered the Walker 55019 Quiet-Flow Stainless Steel Muffler, I was instructed by the Web Site that this gasket was necessary to the muffler installation.  Upon receiving the two parts, I could find no way that this gasket could be used as it did not match the Walker muffler pipe flange and the stock Honda connection was a spring relieved ball-and-cup arrangement that didn't even use a gasket.  I had to use a die grinder to open up the muffler flange to make it work in a ball-and-cup arrangement and this gasket became moot.  So NOT necessary!
B0070Y35OC|5|awesome product, the tint was all precut for me, looks to be high quality tint,  super fast shipping, and even came with a tiny squeegee which i ended up buying one I can bring back now :), awesome seller, highly recommend them, I only needed tint for my 2 front windows and not all 4 so i sent them a request what i needed and boy they are professional and super fast.
B00E1SNPP4|5|Only complaint is there were no clips needed to install, had to purchase seperatly
B004AGCV8Y|5|My first disk break job. No complains
B00HAQBEH0|5|My husband thinks its grand!
B00FXI1PMQ|4|pieces were what you would expect, simple plastic with chrome had to do a little trimming and sanding for proper fit and then apply some glue to ensure they don't come off.<br />they look great on the cluster, should have come from the factory with them.<br />the shipping on the other hand........after going to the USPS tracking website they were shipped from china to NY then to florida it took over 3 weeks to get here if I had known that i  would have bought elsewhere.
B00VNBDWPK|5|Great purchase better than i expected and wasy to install with simple instructions
B000G28PPE|1|Not sure how people ended up with blue, I followed the instructions correctly and let it cure for 24 hours but it still came out  a light purple not blue. I contacted G2 and was asked to send in pictures of it. I was then told that was the correct color, I even had a sample of the color shipped to my home and to my surprise it was also not blue. I am not sure how the person who submitted the blue lexus image was able to obtain that color, as I also sumbitted that image to G2 and was told that, that certain color was a custom order color.<br /><br />The color looks absolutely nothing like the image shown. I tried to contact the seller Car-Accessories they asked I send in pics as well, sent it to them multiple times but was given the run around. Not sure why they choose to use a false image.<br /><br />Simply put do not buy this and expect it to be &#34;blue&#34;! You've been warned.
B006GJYLFY|4|Would have given 5 stars however upon arrival the nozzle was &#34;cracked in half&#34; and &#34;un-usable&#34;. Read many positive reviews about the product, as stated; went on easy, made boat seats look and feel new and had a pleasant smell.  Previously had used Babes and Mothers products.
B00VNBDVOC|1|They don't work, tried All configuration and still didn't work,will never buy from this vendor again
B000CGFS0Y|3|good product, but expensive.
B00TAFUPRE|5|So much better than plain old rubber tubing.  Very flexible and holds fittings well.  I'll be buying more of this to replace rotted rubber lines.
B004GIUGCO|5|These have the best clips on the market!
B00L3LEEYS|1|After paying for the key, cutting the key, and attempting to program the key at a Ford dealership, it could not be programmed. It is useless.
B00WINK9XU|5|I saw this exact kit for sale from a tool truck for $40 more in there sale flyer. It works great.
B001GG2EWE|5|Terrific!
B000BGM7QS|5|works just fine, thanks
B0067UD0NG|5|a quality product at a fraction of the price available locally
B00199F2XG|5|Now this coil kicks butt
B00B4L7Y4E|5|Amazon has the best price. I paid $93.55 which is far less than other places. This comes in an AC Delco box. You can buy this identical rotor at one of the major parts stores as a Raybestos product. I believe that this is a high quality rotor. Buying high quality brake parts costs more money up front but could save a bundle. A hot stop that is just a few feet or just a foot shorter can save a lot one day. I also use the Hawk LTS ferro carbon pads. Everyone has a different opinion on pads and rotors. So this is just my 2 cents.
B000PKX6KG|5|fit well.
B001G4Z5J0|4|I have it on the back of my pickup, and it works well to carry a few things that I can't really keep in my cab or in thew back of the truck when loaded up. The only real suggest I would have is to change the manufacturing process slightly, and the 2 rails that hold the branding plates and hold the 2 sides together, they should make them about 1/2&#34; wider, if they did that then the screw could also be used to adhere the license place to the back when it blocks it on some vehicles.
B000G7AJUS|4|great 10$ funnel
B007TYQ56S|5|Everything you need to replace your broken handle.
B00E1SOWRO|3|Front and rear rotors fit fine front pads were great, the rear pads were 3/16 than the original, had to buy another set
B002PQU4K8|5|As advertised
B00KGGTF9U|5|Keeps my Ford Explorer 2013 noticeably cooler in the hot and humid life of Miami. It is easy to put away when not in use and takes up little space in my glove box or center console. It fits the truck very well!
B001NAQU5U|5|Item as advertised. fit 2014  grizzly 700 perfectly
B000QC6H90|5|best
B00C5TFMCU|5|works good
B00GOK44XE|5|Works great, wish there was an official apple version so it wouldn't constantly tell me it's not supported each time I plug it in.
B00U0AA5FU|4|Fit as they should, look nice.  The Ram heads are grey, not white.
B0009Y2CFS|5|My wife loves this blanket for those cold winter mornings. Used it everyday.
B00FG50LTE|5|At first i thought it was going to be to big but it yirens out perfect fot for my lower drawers on my tool box if you like jurst shifters which i do then this is a good for your tool box
B00SXEQF8G|2|Way too big for my Corolla 2015 model. Perhaps they should do their homework more thoroughly when they say, and I quote, &#34;perfect fit&#34;.
B00FXLJ8U4|4|Since I haven't had a chance to use it yet (knock wood), I wonder if it is too small. but it fits nicely in the door pocket.
B00KC675NC|1|useless crap, came cracked and threads not right (stripped)
B003XWEO7C|5|Received parts in the time stated and fit without a problem.
B00BEVZCDE|5|Smells like Dalek in here.
B00V03D9KY|5|LK-7950 is an outstanding product packed full of features. Yet modestly priced!
B000C81ZJA|5|best price I could find and worked great.
B001ABMY20|1|So far I am not happy with this product. The instructions suck!  The seal from the box to the fender is horrible and it rattles making noise. And of course I'm a few days past my return policy deadline. I'm trying to re-engineer it so that it at least stops rattling, no luck so far.
B000BPZ55Y|5|worked perfect
B007KPWCRW|3|It does the job of adjusting my air shocks. I don't feel the gauge is accurate based on a digital pressure gauge I have. Fits in my saddlebag and take up very little space.
B005VOLKEA|5|Perfect replacement.
B004GCA93G|5|Awesome fast!
B005HAYDR4|5|They make riding in our new jeep more comfy. Something to hold on to!  They are very sturdy.
B00JB2XXPC|1|I had purchased the front seat covers and the quality and fit was excellent, so I decided to purchase the rear set. With so many of Amazons items the description doesn't have a lot of information. The covers arrived designed for a 60/40 seat with a center console. Neither the description or picture showed a center console and the page stated that the covers would fit my truck. Sadly my truck doesn't have a center console in the rear seat. I tried calling Cal Trend since the covers shipped directly from their plant, I explained my problem and gave them order number since Amazon will only refund my purchase and not help me with getting right ones. Well Cal Trends is a no service company the person on the line took the information my name a phone number and told me that someone would call me pretty much when they felt like it. This is the third item I have had to return due to not getting what I ordered. Yes I do make mistakes but in these cases I was very careful in what I was ordering. So now I will be returning the covers for a full refund and will reorder from someone else.
B00AMAHJ6Q|5|Works fine
B000BO8Z9I|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B00Y5MHA8Y|5|Very satisfied with the product it self. Easy to install for anybody that is mechanically inclined.
B00DSD6BZE|5|Item just as presented. This was what I had been looking for
B00FDX9HOO|1|Totally ineffective, does not work, expected performance from this product, completely disappointed.
B000MD3EHG|4|works great
B003AVO41M|3|Wrong mount for my model engine - my own fault.<br />DID arrive quickly<br />IS a quality auto part.
B0074EJ6H8|5|Great
B00D2QL0DU|3|It worked if I pumped the entire time but it would not gravity feed from fuel tank to fuel can.  Leaked around stem seal.
B000CLMMYO|5|Brakes arrived on time and work great with my car. No complaints so far. They are quiet and make no noises.
B0007UAXJQ|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B011E8W9YQ|5|cute. Very like, is really the fox fur
B0010E00T6|5|Easy install and was able to notice better airflow/smell almost immediately.  Comes with instructions, but if you are still hesitant there are youtube videos that can help guide you through the process, save some money and do it yourself!
B000C9WLBA|5|As all Wix products I have used in the past, this filter is very well made. However, Amazon will tell you this filter is suitable for Honda models of the past few years- when, in actuality, the 51356 has now been superceded by the 57356 filter for most Honda models. Wix WILL NOT WARRANTY THE FILTER IF YOU USE THE 51356. Consult the Wix website and use their application guide to find which filter you should be using, or use this one at your own risk.
B005FNKSMW|5|Perfect fit and functioned to our expectations.
B00D7LTNW0|3|Brought to compare to other product I purchased. 3D and pearl better. They use less product
B00JF9IJ7I|4|Sturdier than I anticipated.
B000GVJEOG|1|Did not fit not even close. Would not recommend these.
B004I16YOS|5|Perfect fit. Great buy
B000C5YD42|5|Installed the sensor, reset check engine code, and code never returned.
B00C0SQ8KG|4|Video:  https://youtu.be/5FH3KgvIIxA  Posi-products tap (a must have):  LEDFootProducts.com  Just got this installed and I like them.  I purchased from &#34;senlips&#34; and they did not have bolts in front. Just on side caps.  I highly recommend getting some of the posi-products wire butt connectors or t-taps from LED Foot Products. They are a little higher priced than scotch locks but LED Foot Products was cheapest on the taps and butt connectors. Once you use these you will never buy scotch locks again. I sent them an email and they sold me some weatherpack connectors, seals and terminals also (not on website) and shipped them with my order.  You need a special tool for weather packs but some have used needle nose pliers. They also have a harness for their LED kits that you can snip off the red wire ring terminal and use it for this Light bar.  They are bright and were easy to install.  I used a Weather Pack connector on the end of the light and to get a good connection. I ran the lights off my bright light switch since I don't have bright lights with my HIDs. They come on fast and go off with no delay.  These aren't &#34;100 mile&#34; lights and the spots will &#34;flood&#34; the width of a road way nicely.  They would be good in the woods or off road and for driving. The floods are imperceptible and probably useless really. The lights did cast light for long distances and would light up street signs well beyond my HID head lights do.  I pulled the end caps off and used silicone 1 which is 100% waterproof silicone. I silicones around all of the edges the cap attached too. They had a rubber gasket in there that appeared to seal well but I didn't want to take any chances.  I also sealed the seam of the front of the lens. They were probably sealed enough as you can see the silicon fills the channel the lens sits in and &#34;glues&#34; it in. The lens is plastic. The brackets were aluminum.  Update 1:  so far the waterproofing has proven to be effective. I don't have any fogging so far and it has rained and had condensation on the outside but none inside.
B002OCD3RY|3|Becareful with all aftermarket mounts for 2001 Lexus ES300 Automatic Transmission U140E (18 bolts pan)...holes will not match.  I have not been able to find one that match... Go with OEM.
B0040CTTH4|5|The clips worked as they should-no surprises. If you are doing any work on your rig which requires removing interior panel in, have clips on hand because you will invariably break some.
B006H4ONNS|3|The part came quickly, as advertised. Seems to be built better than the OEM regulator, especially in regards to the central pin of the motor assembly that seems to fall apart in the original component over time. The bolt pattern fits the car. However, when I installed the regulator, I found out that the glass mounting rail is offset from the mounting pads on the glass panel by about 1/2&#34;. I took the regulator out and inspected it in comparison with the original part: when completely folded, the whole structure looks indeed quite a bit &#34;flatter&#34;, which is why it doe snot reach the glass properly. I had to solve the problem by bending the blades, installing the regulator, and re-testing the fit. After 4-5 of such cycles, which took over 1 hour, I finally managed to correct the offset on both sides and mount the glass panel. However, the window still does not work very well: it goes down very quickly but raises very slowly and seems to be working progressively harder as it goes up. There is also some kind of a jerk in the mechanism as it starts lifting the glass from the lowest position. Nevertheless, I can now close my window completely, so my goal has been achieved. But the overall quality of this part seems disappointing.
B00EM2HU46|5|exact match  even fits dirt bikes
B001EA0LJK|5|Great Stuff!!! Used it on a custom seat I built.
B00K150X42|3|so first thing that i have to say is this thing is massive. compared to  9500 winch this is thing is at least double that size and twice as heavy too.<br />next the winch look to be of very good quality easy to install i have yet to use because i still waiting on some things. i will let you know how it performes so as of now im going to give it 3 stars.
B001UEHMCO|5|Good product, good price, great service. This appears to be hi amp, which I wanted in a micro & need for my application, the primary reason for my purchase.
B0000AXYA0|5|This stuff works great. If I had a ocean going boat, I would spray the entire thing with it, to make it last. I use it a lot. Wear a mask spraying it, it's strong.
B000Q8U89Y|5|VERY USER FRIENDLY
B00G1Y38JE|5|Fit into my 94 cbr f2 with no problems, 2 minute install, as long as you have a flathead and a 10mm wrench.
B00BCRM9RM|1|DO NOT GET!!! It is supper thin , I mean paper thin. I rather pay a few extra dollars more to get a better quality.
B004A30UHG|5|VERY USER FRIENDLY
B000C808SE|4|great
B000C5SG54|5|Replaced the o2 sensor on my 2002 Tundra. has been running for over a year now with no issues.
B00YI3IGA6|5|Amazing product!!! highly recommended....
B00CR3RXTO|5|Wow this stuff really works! From very dark brown...my BMW 330ci oil is now honey gold- just the way I put it in a month earlier. Im amazed. I just bough 2 more bottles for my other cars!
B0028R5ELI|5|Definitely looks like this picture. This sticker has been through one very tough maine winter. It still sticking on strong. Definitely good quality!
B00BITHKD2|2|Broke after 6 months ...WTH
B0000AY3DS|1|Poor quality
B0067UCWUS|1|Not sure about the quality, but It does not fit a 2000 Lexus RX300 like it said it would.
B006N99EXQ|5|ok, excellent seller
B000C2CJVE|5|arrived when and as should have
B000C7YLEW|5|Didn't have any problem with my old one, but I was replacing a part attached to it, so I figured I would replace this anyway. I ended up needing it because the ignition pin broke off inside the old switch. This saved me a lot of time, and now hopefully it will last longer!
B00GHT6SF4|5|A perfect match for the interior of my truck and the quality is as good as what came in my truck!

B0041QCAHA|4|They are what they are as advertised. Just wish someone would make something that looks better. They fit well and were easy to install however not enough wire to make a professional appearance. Had to buy additional wire and tubing to run the wire through at the hardware store.
B00266YNUE|5|fits great
B010W72VGG|5|Good Quality, metal not plastic and shipped quicker than my license plates.
B000EH4V0Y|3|Used to pour DSG oil into my 2013 Gold TDI. End fits right into opening on the oil filter housing. The funnel came with a kinked house and the oil leaked out below the funnel (minimally).
B00062YBDE|5|Works great.
B00RHSEYG4|2|Had the EXACT same experience. Thanks for posting. At first my husband thought I was just being careless when I was removing the grill so I could wash the filter material. Good to hear from others that they agree it's Dometic's poor design that's the issue, not just me being careless. Now my husband believes me.  We were wondering if we can figure out a way to strengthen the new grill when it arrives, to maybe prevent the breakage from occurring in the first place. It's ridiculous that every time we need to wash the filter, we have to stress about breaking this grill!
B00CMX20H4|5|Easy to install under the false left side cover on my v star 1300. Took about an hour with the plug and play wiring kit. Horn is very loud and I feel much safer being able to get the attention of other riders on the road!
B00MAJ12AG|5|beautiful plate
B000COVLC0|5|nice plugs
B007BLMVPS|5|perfect fit for my 2002 Mustang GT
B000N35LJE|1|very disappointed with this tool,stones wore out in few minutes, had to go purchase a better one locally which worked great. Don't waste your money on this
B00JVHLS3G|4|ok, but fell out after a few weeks. Shipped on time
B009S5GD8Q|5|Exactly what i needed worked perfectly.
B009FUFBTG|3|They are not lint free.<br />I had to wash the whole package before getting most of the lint out.
B007HRMODK|5|It works perfectly.  Just as advertized
B005N53EI2|5|Perfect!
B00BFDIFGC|5|excellent
B000BRF38Q|5|Good
B006JYNEEK|5|Bought as a gift. I was told that it works well.
B006EIIYDM|2|The hole configurations are top to bottom not side to side as is shown in photo. I sent the first one back and explained what I needed and they sent the exact same one I received the first time. Part does work just doesn't fit into the allotted spot. Now I will have to rig it to fit. If you are not handy to be able to cut the hole with a dremmel look elsewhere.
B00QU70X7M|5|Perfect match to what we had before!
B001UGNJ60|5|These were worth every penny!  I strongly recommend this product.  Here's the long story as to why.  We recently traded in our 19' bunkhouse for a 24' bunkhouse travel trailer.  The new one has much more motion in it then the old one. It doesn't bother me, but it does bother my wife; so much so that it was making her sick. She is prone to motion sickness.  I installed new scissor jacks, but it didn't help.  I reviewed and researched numerous products.  I installed a different product first (the BAL X-Chock).  Those helped, but did not solve all of the motion issues.  The review on these lock-arm stabilizing bars seemed good, so I figured I'd try it.  I purchased two boxes.  I had a slight installation issue.  I called and was able to speak with a live person here in North America.  That person was unable to help me.  She gave me a cell number to another person in Texas.  He answered his phone and spent five minutes with me on the phone.  He was incredibly helpful.  That night I finished the installation.  My wife could not believe the difference when stepping up into the camper.  We've been on two trips since then, and no complaints.  She's happy again....I'm happy.  Great product.  Great service.  I don't write many reviews, but I had to write on this one.  If anyone's struggling with motion in their parked camper, this product works.  Google it for videos of people who have posted their experience.
B009PJK5QG|5|Awesome price & super fast delivery! Worked great, allowing me to do rear brakes on my VW just like the pros. A+++
B008032QBA|5|Works Fine. Only issue i have with it is it is louder than the old one. Easy install came with everything i needed, including wiring harness. Did not need harness on My 2000 Chevy Blazer LS.
B00029WYEY|5|Great
B008N1UUS0|5|Great
B002DTV172|4|easy to install, working well.
B0041TQSRA|5|This product works great in my 2009 Hyundai Sonata.  I had a lot of trouble ordering an aftermarket cabin air filter (CAF) since the products at my local brick & mortar AutoZone and Pep Boys don't fit it.  The correct fit has a small lip on one side that lifts the filter up into the compartment.<br /><br />Previously I only bought the more expensive OEM Hyundai CAF but I was happy to see other reviews here that this product fit... and it does!  Glad I found this item at a lower price with free shipping.
B00LTHX8SO|5|Love it!
B00NP60URE|2|Returning it as a piece came loses during the first use.<br />Vacuum pump works, but not fabulously. Switched to pumping the pedal as it was faster.
B004ME11FS|5|Perfect length for our camper.  Good quality product.
B00DMEFH7W|4|Fit well. One of the stretch straps ripped when we tightened everything down. So far they have been decent cheap covers.
B00ONHGAXC|5|It works well.
B004UTCVG8|1|Better off buying metal plate frame and adhesive lettering and doing yourself.  You'd likely do better job at ensuring there are no air bubbles in lettering. I feel duped!!!
B00PSEDLT0|4|I really like these seat covers.  I ordered a set to cover the deteriorating leather seats in my '97 Miata.  The seat back pulls over the back of the seat and fits very snugly. To achieve the same tight fit with the seat cushion, the seat must be removed to do the job right.  The seat cushion must be stretched around the seat bottom and its elastic bands secured with hooks under the seat.  This is quite easy and if you are mechanically inclined enough to remove 4 bolts, you can remove your seats and get this done.  The job took me about an hour from start to finish.  I should add that my Miata has headrest speakers and I did not notice any appreciable deterioration in sound.
B000WJCL56|4|I ordered these to install on the rear of a KLR650.  I like the look, build quality, and cable length is abundant.  Unfortunately, I discovered that the stems/stalks were too short and wouldn't extend enough through the holes in the factory rack.  Instead of returning them, I enlarged the hole with a flat blade bit which allowed me to install them.  Some have attached straight to the plastic to overcome this.
B000FTSE2C|4|Helpful.
B00D9SPA5K|5|I absolutely love it!!!
B0097YH972|5|This Holder is indestructible.  Very will built from steel.
B002XM5G70|4|I hope it works.
B008AJQJ7G|5|Mounted curved 32&#34; light bar behind it and it looks great! Easy installation and makes the storage lid feel more solid. Holes didn't line up perfectly but with a little push it worked fine.
B000NWA6TU|5|A Great set of Plugs
B0079QRRRM|5|Great backpack is pretty good and ideal for riding everyday to work
B000EF1N02|5|Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
B00C8A2WZG|5|It is Genuine Honda Accord all weather rubber floor mats, ok. They server their purpose as advertised. They are perfectly fit for Honda Accord 2014, and are easy to install. They don't smell as bad as I would expect, so cabin does not carry that horrible rubber smell, at least not for my nose.
B00D9E3GTG|4|This is functional. It's not as cute as I thought and a lot thinner but it worked for a basket we were making for a work drawing. I like that it folds up with a handle.
B0068EVJS4|5|Worked ok. Didnt flap too much, even at 100+.
B002TLUZGW|4|For the price, these baskets were very much worth it. The overall build quality was quite high and all of my welds seemed in tact. The paint was pretty scuffed up and all of the screws, washers and nuts had busted open during the shipping so they could definitely improve their packaging of these kits. I did pick up a few cans of spray paint and painted them before installing after reading some of the reviews here talking about rust and corrosion.  I gave this kit 4 stars instead of 5 primarily based on the included mounting hardware. The screws are very long which limited where the metal brackets could be located on my 08 Honda Foreman without punching through the plastic body panels. Additionally, I will have to find some heavy duty U bolts to strengthen the back rack mounts. The rack hangs off the back of the atv quite a bit and I am getting a lot of stretch and flex from the four thin mounting brackets that got installed back there. There is no way I would load that back rack down with corn for filling feeders with only the supplied brackets and I definitely wouldn't put the weight of a person back there!  Overall, I'm happy with what I got for the price paid. Just plan to buy some spray paint and U Bolts if you pick this kit up.
B00APY5WTA|5|You get what you pay for!!! {{ I would definitely rate it a 9-out-of-10 }}  I've never had one before, as we use to have a large SUV ....but, friends of mine have.  So, with that said, the only issues (besides price ...&#34;smile&#34;) ....is: if you decide to replace the threaded hitch-pin with a locking pin, the cargo carrier wobbles a bit.  So, I just kept the treaded pin (after purchasing the locking one through the mail), and ran a cabe & lock through, to secure the carrier to our Dodge Durango RT, to make sure some clown wouldn't steal it in the middle of the night.<br /><br />Again, it's one of the more expensive, rear cargo carriers for a hitch (we looked at THULE also), but this one seemed more diversified, as you can put your bikes on it, and it conveniently folds-up!  But, for the price, it should already come with taillights! (I purchased a kit)  Which wasn't too bad putting on. I found a ROLA kit on-line for only $29.95.  The LED kit is more expensive.  Also, it is built extremely well, so keep-in-mind it's heavier compared to others.  I'm getting older (49), but can still lift it myself, and balance it while inserting into the hitch, but an older person might need help?  Overall, a very well made product!
B008VE2C7Q|4|Fit perfect and fast delivery
B001LRJHFK|5|Such a simple little thing but it really helps if your hands are not so young.
B0066D9V6E|5|As described
B00QSPU0NS|4|Used once, worked fine
B00LFL73BC|4|i havent istalled it yet but its ok
B00CU6B4PC|1|bad product
B003EAW57E|5|Best of show
B005CLLMUY|5|Perfect in every way.
B006M4AOCC|4|perfect mats for my 2012 corolla that was missing all the mats.  A little less thick/rugged than I expected, but they are holding up great so far!
B004WOTD6W|1|Scent last only one day.
B00SA46FRK|5|Good quality
B00157TGXY|4|Works as expected!
B006X6OSJO|5|Just great fits good really like it
B000EDOSKG|5|Same thing...wanted it &#34;just in case&#34;
B000J2I7T0|3|works well, like it!
B008G23ELQ|5|Excellent product,  perfect fit.  Bought a set for my other car.
B000L7JQE8|4|worked well.
B000R8Y7BS|5|These shocks were exactly what I was looking for and offered more control and a better ride, especially with a heavy load or towing a trailer. Much better for me than the standard shocks that came on the vehicle.
B00K72C1T4|5|Charges MC battery and holds it charged. Doesn't overload battery due to its micro processor control.  has led lights tha show status and connections. Doesn't get hot. Plugged directly into my MC charger plug.
B000NSMXPY|5|Functional, and the pad will prevent slippage between the car and the jack.
B00926IMJY|5|awesome
B00VKQ6ECQ|5|Works perfectly, no issues.
B00IS941D2|5|Awesome bumper. I'm not very handy, but I was able to install this bumper with a friend. Only thing is that you will need power tools.
B001EA0LVS|3|Just average. Door becomes a little harder to close. Does the edge protection ok. Not really clear colored.  A little blue-ish.
B004HM0N4A|4|great deal!
B000TYOS3C|3|Plastic was thinner than I thought it would be
B00K9BD4IK|5|nice stickers :)
B00N7KNI1S|2|Does NOT FIT rear of 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sport with light mount.
B00W45KF7M|1|thought was spelled &#34;though.&#34;
B00RCJ0K7K|5|It was perfect
B00HYJDA0C|1|didn't last one week.  Left me stranded on the lake!
B001TL34PC|4|They really fit...But not strong enough.
B006M8KNEC|4|Two hooks weren't exactly what I thought they would be, but I was able to latch it properly to my Legacy GT without any issues.
B003U7UR3A|5|Good i enjoy it was easy to install
B001GJ3FIS|1|Heavy Duty?  This nozzle worked great for two days before the front part that turns started to become separated from the rest of the nozzle causing water to leak down your arm and even spray backward at you while trying to water the lawn.  I guess if you didn't care about your water bill, it would still be great on a really hot day when you didn't mind getting as wet as your lawn.  I guess the non-heavy duty ones from this company must only last one day instead of two.
B00XB3CFUQ|5|These LED Lights are Amazing!!! They look great and they are exactly what I expected. I had to use a little more force to get them in than I expected but once they were in place they worked Great. I definitely would recommend this product!!!
B00D1CQVIY|1|Relay was defective upon delivery..  More specifically one of the black wires coming out of the relay had already &#34;pulled out&#34; of the relay itself with no way to repair.  Quality control is clearly lacking here..
B00KTAUK3S|5|WORKS GREAT
B0089LT6KM|5|This is the real Honda part - perfect fit, very easy to install.  It is much cheaper than buying it at the dealer.  Will purchase again when needed.
B0051QD3AC|5|I have had this kit in the basement for a year, finally got around to putting on the cruiser.  It looks great.  Easiest wiring job i have ever had. The long part is figuring out where you want them placed.  Then easy as pie.
B000C9SR90|5|Thanks, great
B00EKW1NEG|1|silver, not black as shown. not worth the gas to return. really just annoying.
B00K56PO7S|4|Very cute. However, I live in a hot hot hot city and my poor daisy is getting beat up by the sun. I may need a new one next summer.
B004CFVZ4Y|5|Works good no problem
B00IWGLEMC|3|This tool bag won't really fit a Dyna Wide Glide unless you remove the straps and use zip ties. Once I did that,  it works okay.
B00REJXAZC|5|Fits good looks great on my f150 Ford truck . Love it .
B006V2ZZ7E|5|A good value and nicely done for the ladies.
B003EOZLEO|5|They fit perfect and look awesome!  Put them on by myself in about an hour, including taking off the Mopar Rock Rails.
B00018ZWFO|5|My Neighbors kids were zooming around and around. Exactly as advertised and super fast shipping. Thank you
B008AVCYE6|5|I had the white background (and more expensive one) gauge, replaced it with this one since it goes much better with my mustang´s interior colors and all. Works perfectly.
B0041MB5X4|5|Great
B00AQIDXVO|5|good price. brand new condition
B006HFBYWK|5|Bought it as a replacement for the one which broke (original one from the front fascia) and it fits perfectly, no major hassle, in the end, its Roush original so its good.
B007HIE81K|5|Great
B008Y3NZ0W|5|Very light in comparison to original, but does the job.
B000688VNE|5|I bought my Hi-Lift in 1974. I have used it to lift a variety vehicles, trailers and tractors over the years. It has gotten me off of high centers and out of deep holes. I have pulled more fence posts with it than I can count. I have replace the climbing pins twice and repainted once in that time. I can't think of another tool that has served me as well or as long.
B003ZOH63W|2|Just didn't work.. Funny, that when the world was analog I received all the local channels. Now that the world went digital, I don't receive a one. I mapped all the broadcast towers and the closet tower was 52 Miles as the crow flies, still nothing. Save your money .
B008G35YJA|5|Perfect fit replacement for my scuffed up old headlamps - easy installation, great instructions.
B008Y21YFQ|1|did not have the plastic hooks shown and described, looks good but has steel hooks and rubber ends that fall off.
B00KTHV10C|3|You still have to get it cut and programmed  so keep that in mind
B004GCP4GS|5|this is the part I was looking for and the condition too
B000C44CK8|5|These shocks restored my ride to almost brand new conditions. Considering I put these on a 2000 Mazda B3000, the ride is 100% improvement.
B00397B0U0|5|Fast shipping, great price!!! Thank you
B00026Z3E0|5|perfect
B005OSLVK6|5|Fit my carb just great. still have this kit on here after a few years.
B000CPI5Z0|5|Excellent product...
B00C2SOL2G|4|They fit well, but are made of a hard plastic rather than flexible rubber
B00652ZCZ0|5|Bought this for my 2000 TL1000R geared up in the rear and it works perfect, very happy. Speed is corrected now.
B00MI3W4KG|5|Fit great.  looks good on vehicle
B006OCAP80|5|Looks identical to the OEM part.  It installed nicely too. You can't beat the price. Way cheaper than the dealer.
B008EQRVSG|5|Like having the capability to charge 2 batteries at once, saves time and gives me extra batteries for photography trips
B007UST3A8|5|I purchased the Metropolitan Gray 36C for my Mazda 2008 S. I read quite a few reviews complaining about the colors not matching so I talked with an employee at the Mazda Dealership about it. A guy working at the parts department said he had the same problem himself when using them and said the issue can be resolved by shaking it first and squeezing a little paint onto some paper towel in order to remove any settled glitter near the stem. After following these two simple steps, he said it should come out as the correct color. I haven't used this product yet but I will update this review once I do.  Also, according to the dealership it is single stage paint, so there's no need to apply a clear coat over it. Just make sure to use primer before hand for chipped paint and to use rubbing compound 3 days afterwords to get a really nice finish.
B00AKH33MU|5|good price. good product.
B000COA1JE|5|These Fender flares look great on my 85 Jeep CJ8 Scrambler
B0007WJRF0|1|This is not a custom fit cover by any means for a newer Toyota Tacoma 05-current the Tacoma bed narrows toward the rear this cover does not follow that taper it is square in nature leaving a less then desired look there is another manufactur on Amazon that does make that is about $25 less and it fits perfectly due to that fact it vehicle specific and by far a superior quality
B00JF6527G|4|Unless you have the tool for the springs it is real hard to install. I used a makeshift set up with a ratchet strap and wire. The tool should be included.
B007HRWV06|5|Perfect replacement. Old anode was completely used and this replacement inserted perfectly.
B009XISPWU|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B00OZSM4C0|1|I purchased this handle for a 2006 Hyundai Sonata and when I received the item it did not fit and was poorly made product. When I ordered this item I even used the “will this fit your car” on the page when ordering. Once I received this item it felt like every piece was loose and about to fall out or off. Where you hook up the cables to unlock and open the door did not even fit the cable lock on my car. This product need to be looked at and adjusted to stop these kinds of mistakes. Bad misleading product all the way around.
B005N6WC16|3|Runs on the small size.
B002U729UA|5|Great
B000WO3IQM|5|Awesome filter the best filters out there
B0044GNBRK|5|Perfect  fit. I&#34;will buy it again.
B00LZX0H72|4|easy to work with
B00OHYZTNI|1|Total rip off. Wasted of money. It doesn't  work
B0006HPA02|5|Love these wires! Installed in a 2000 Silverado no problems with fine wire iridium plus and gained 3mpg when I can keep my foot off the gas. Did I mention they were cheaper than rock auto and Napa's write sets on Amazon? Saved money everywhere with this purchase.
B00SYS46HI|4|The holder is attractive, durable, goes well with the BMW interior, has sliding vents to adjust the fragrance (like the air vents), fits the BMW (current models) vents very well and the individual fragrances have held their scents for over a month in the heat. It is a little pricey but it is a BMW matching accessory!
B0017KJ0E4|1|I read the ad wrong.  This is only the lens!  Not what I needed.  Nice looking lens though.
B007OMZD6I|5|Fit in designed pattern.  Works well.
B000C2JUT8|1|Products look solid and probably are. However in combination with Wearever rotors they do not work. the backer plate on the outside pads<br />ground the rotor surface on the &#34;drum portion&#34; not the brake surface but the protrusion that sits on the lugs.<br />  These pads also fit tight against the rotor, a lot thicker than the wearever pads I had to purchase in an emergency run this morning, but the wearever fit...<br /><br />Maybe in combination with bendix rotors they would work fine.
B0141QK0WG|5|This pack is wonderful. I love the multi colors. We use the colors to determine which type of cleaning so chemo Lea don't mix. Blue are for our motorcycle helmets, orange for dusting the house and so on....  They are a great size, good thickness and feel soft. They do leave a bit of lint the first use. I love the way these cloths pick up lint, dust and fur.
B000C9D24K|5|works great
B010QBCZ1O|5|Great product.  Light output on low beam is great, high beam is not much different.  This light fits the housing on my '04 Mean Streak,  but not without some modification to make it stay in place.
B00ERXG7DK|5|Love this &#34;holster.&#34;  I'm not a biker but I've been looking for this type of drop leg &#34;fanny pack&#34; for over a year.  I use it for concealed carry (smaller handgun - on the order of a Walther .380).  Put my smartphone in the outer most pocket and with Bluetooth earphones I'm all set.  The top pocket will fit a pack of cigarettes if you're so inclined - I like for car/house key ring(s).  It is made of durable material with quality zippers (including the zipper pulls).  I highly recommend this product whether you're the king of the road or an overweight, over the hill urbanite such as myself.  Worth every penny.
B00CWKMD5Q|3|A little too big for these seats.
713825895X|5|Works as advertised!
B00MXV6SVE|1|Perfect fit but they did not light up in my Lexus.  I had to put the original bulbs back in until I rectify this problem with the seller.
B00EK6NS22|4|Bright
B00G8XN5LO|4|good price
B00JA80PEO|4|I debated between 3 and 4 stars. It does what it is supposed to pretty well but the sound quality really needs to be better. Not enough volume for highway speeds either.
B00PJD83XO|5|Works great.
B00G4AB4MS|5|Used the carrier today for the first time.  I have to say that it was a snap.  While the directions are printed a little small (could just be my eyes), they were complete.  I really like that all of the arms are pinned allowing them to be stored in different configurations.  I can transport it one way, and without any tools, deploy it for the bikes.  I carried women's cruisers on it.  I had to adjust the first bike on a couple of times to get the second one where the padded bar would catch the bike frame.  Not a big deal.  The bikes were held apart from each other and away from the center post.  I noticed no damage of any kind when I took them off.  For piece of mind, I used 2 velcro straps on each tire; 1 to each point of contact with the tire, and a strap around the padded frame support.  Overkill I'm sure, but since it was the first use, I didn't want to risk it.  The threaded pin worked well.  I don't think it's a big deal to throw a ¾&#34; box wrench or ratchet in the truck to secure the carrier.  While I noticed some slight shaking of the vertical support, the carrier itself never budged.
B000CN77RO|5|Perfect fit for a b body to replace the Oem
B00C5SXB38|5|Very nice. Got theses for my dads Silverado and they look great.
B00U4ERP46|5|Works great - easy to apply.
B000C16XUI|5|Works great, I love it.
B0084L0YR6|4|Would have been 5 stars if I didn't have to solder. Works and fits great though, and for one without the requirement to solder, it would have cost 4X more.
B0012ILZAS|5|Bought a new pontoon.  Like all Boats like this the horn provided is inadequate.  Poor sound and no range.  The WoLo is different.  Have had it for the Summer and it looks and sounds great!  Very attractive mounted on the deck.  Very pleased overall.
B001EAQTRI|5|For the longest time I suffered at the claws of that terrible high-pitched gremlin that everyone here is probably all too familiar with, thinking it was just something I had to deal with. Then, as if the clouds parted and light shone down, this product descended from the heavens and banished the vile creature. So glad to have found this, and finally rid myself of that soul crushing nuisance. Wish I had known about it earlier. This works wonderfully. I have no idea how it works, probably magic. I only get slight hints of that accursed devil when the line has nothing playing on it and the volume is cranked (which will basically never happen under normal conditions). Feel I should run through the streets proclaiming the good word of the ground loop noise isolator, but instead I'll just enjoy distraction free music in my car.
B00VSOU67E|5|Installed for extra reverse lights, plenty bright enough to see out of the dark tint at night overall very pleased with these.
B00C0SQ92I|3|Fit was pretty good, but quality is rather poor and cheap.
B00KDOKWT2|5|Great item at a great price and fast shipping!
B00WQHMMVK|5|Works great
B005CLMWYO|2|S***ty design on fords part ..I have to buy a new one almost every year
B0002LAC6E|3|Id rather use a chemical and follow up with a spray wax than scrub on painted surfaces using an abrasive sponge or pad and have to follow up with polishing!  After unboxing this item I immediately concluded that its not safe for painted surfaces, I don't care what they claim.  This will abrade your cars finish. Don't believe me? Test it out on a nicely polished black vehicle. It does has its uses. I use it to remove road contaminants on windows, unpainted surfaces and chrome bumpers. There it is safe.
B0091QL45O|5|Good qualities and a great seller.
B010ILLOK0|5|The whole experience went just the way it was supposed to go. Thanks!
B004Q78GL8|5|Fast shipper great price
B00CHD9022|5|Perfect fit for 2005 Honda Accord
B000SL0R9K|5|Just a regulation first aid kit.  The nice durable case is why I bought this, making it easier to supplement with additional items that I'll be carrying in the car.  You could probably put together the same quality type of kit, but it's just as easy and convenient to order from Amazon.
B00IJLBC4A|5|Received the part in a timely manner and was pleased.
B000G76PLA|5|Works great.  Great quality
B00D90ZFJ4|5|Great
B001FHQQJG|1|The part is defective, the providers do not respond to the claims of customers
B00VSAP9W0|5|Perfect size, easy to follow instructions,  easy to apply and looks great!!
B000FPYHOU|1|JUNK, WON'T KEEP CORRECT DATE OR TIME FOR MORE THAN A DAY.
B0023TQFN2|5|Well made, quality materials.  Does the job well and decently priced, thus the rating.
B00TZH7U8Y|3|Matching the brake knobs was my goal. No problem there.<br />Strange 4 point base. Doesn't sit flat or settle into cross frame.<br />Nut & washer missing from resealed package.<br />Bracket too small to hug standard (thin) Mack steering wheel. Bolts too short to extend reach.<br />Don't want to return. Trying to find longer bolts or thinner/deeper bracket.
B00C5STXSK|5|Works great.
B005IROIDU|4|love it
B00T4BA1C8|5|Works great
B00AZPI0NE|5|100% satisfied.
B000630240|3|If you're looking for a high-quality, advanced alarm system for your car, do NOT get this one. Instead save the money and put it towards a better alarm.<br /><br />If you're looking for an affordable alarm, that you can install by yourself without cutting into any wires, then this one is okay.<br /><br />I still had to replace the remote battery before the install was even complete and make some modifications to the remote so it would work at all (backing on the buttons is plastic/silicone and had to add graphite to make the contact points work).<br /><br />Install still took over an hour, but I wanted a more secure install by wiring it into the frame and not just using the cheap adhesive pad on the back of the device.<br /><br />I'm not happy with my purchase, but not upset enough to return it - so three stars.
B0055EALW8|5|I needed way more than I purchased. My fault. But price can't be beat and shipping was a+
B00PGYSSLI|5|Awesome and fast
B00KTHXO2U|5|Worked perfectly with my 2005 Tacoma. Needed to perform the pairing process about four times before I got it right. Make sure to follow the instructions and perform the exact action listed in the CAPITALIZED words and it will work.
B00XFQYTZS|5|No comments
B00RZTD4H0|5|Excellent cover. Free shipping is plus. No more towels for me.
B006G2MJZU|5|Fits perfect, great shipping
B0049MM468|5|Worked great, easy to use. Air is cold now.
B0038RDQA8|3|Not what I expected. Thought it was complete seatcover not just a towel
B001BNASPM|1|Only had them for a week or so and blue in the star is already fading color .
B005JI6ZZW|4|Did not fit exactly but was able to use it
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works as expected.
B001TYMK1S|1|Did not fit the seats correctly, which sagged in the middle of the seat
B0016KAAV2|5|Excellent product.  Perfect fit for my vehicle, very rugged.  Have driven/used this hitch with bike rack for more than a 1000 miles since the 2 weeks i've had it.
B00GFLVRKU|3|Plastic didn't fit perfectly but was still good looking
B00S5FE9MC|5|Fits my Trailhawk perfectly.
B00FW1DRZC|5|I purchased my car used, and the dealership has a policy to throw away all floor mats!! I couldn't believe it. I purchased these from Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />These were great and fit my 2014 Kia perfectly.
B002UPL61U|5|Used this to make a heat shield for my 2015 Corvette Zo6. Works great never have overheated the car with this simple mod.
B002HIBMG4|5|This is a novelty helmet just as described, but better. Workmanship and padding is excellent, looks very good!!!!!
B00EEDWRYG|5|Looks great on volvos
B00WZXA8OI|5|Loved the look and fit of these hubcabs.  My car looks updated now .
B0074A8JWA|5|We had a hard time getting this remote programmed, and did end up having to pay the dealer, but once we did it worked perfectly! I still saved money over what the dealer would've charged for the remote.<br /><br />*Update: a month after being programmed, this remote suddenly stopped locking the car. I will take it back, but may update my review depending on what happens.
B00L4HCMDG|5|amazing product.  hope they hold up for a few years.
B0031BOV6E|5|Only grips i ever buy anymore
B000FW2MWW|5|works great

B00CS7T0IQ|5|Great product...work great on our JD Gator!
B00PATBL3Q|1|the screw come undone so it won't hold keys.  also the mercedes emblem pops out.  would not purchase this again
B001EOV492|5|excellent
B013ME9PII|5|Very nice indeed.  Solved a problem I've had for years.
B0051PJWQW|1|not all that great
B00JIJ4LWW|4|I used this on my 15-year-old leather sofa and loveseat. I've used leather cleaners on them from time to time, but this is the only product that not only cleaned the furniture, but also restored a soft sheen to the leather. It makes the leather look great, is easy to use and doesn't leave an oily or sticky film on the furniture.
B004GC261E|5|Just what I needed.
B00E5PK8TE|5|Works Great
B002TIECCS|5|All perfect!
B003VCBDG4|5|Works great.  Makes oil changes much cleaner and simpler.
B002PQOE7M|4|Pretty good light
B000VKOD9S|5|Just what we needed.  Fit perfect.
B004TNOZ64|5|It was a perfect fit, and it looks great
B000B5KPQ8|5|Works great for keeping the flies away from my Chicken coop!  I heard about it on a backyard chicken coop blog.  It works!
B006X8BFLQ|5|This looks great on my 2013 F-150.  If I was double jointed it would have been easy to install.  As it was it took me a while to get the screws tightened because of the close quarters with the screws coming up from the bottom and it was very hard to get my hands and screwdriver into the right position.  I really like the way it looks so the trouble installing it doesn't really matter.
B004X63XVU|5|not used
B007SZCUIA|3|I GAVE THEM A 3 STAR RATING BECAUSE ON HAD A DIRECT SHORT IN IT. THE ONES THAT WORK ARE REALLY GOOD LIGHTING. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM A 5 IF ALL OF THEM WORKED.
B000KZ0PTQ|1|poor quality
B00BQYCJKI|5|Quality towels are a detailers best friend. These fit the bill perfectly.
B009WK6XN2|5|Fits kids good
B0002UEN1U|5|Ultra Black is the best - this is my favorite gasket sealer - goes on easy and cleans up easy.
B009VOQ05U|5|YES, they did forget a piece and the hardware was missing... I sent an email through amazon to the seller and they apologized and sent me all the stuff I needed. They sent it out the same day I asked for it and responded quickly and sent a tracking number when I asked. YES, the parts were all scratched up when they got here... They package them poorly but what do you expect!? you are paying less than $100 for something that cost 3x-5x more ANYWHERE else. So do as I did, go down to Sears or Lowes and pick up one can of rust proof semi gloss spray paint to match the color they send you and spray paint it!!! It takes so little effort and only costs maybe $3. I used two c-clamps on each side of the rack because I didn't want to drill and it works SUPER well. I can easily fit 3 kayaks up there but right after I put it up I went on a camping trip and only took 2 kayaks. Cut pool noodle in half (longways) and put on half on front rack and one half on rear rack. Tied them down with 3 pieces of paracord each and threw the kayaks up there. One ratchet strap on the front and one on the back from the cleats that they had welded on there. WORKED PERFECTLY. I tried to move the kayaks by grabbing the handles on them and push/pull/lift violently. They didn't move on the rack and the rack didn't move. Only thing that moved was the truck! (talk about sturdy!) So I drove the 5 hour drive up to our campsite in the Adirondacks and they were just as sturdy as when I started the trip. . . so anyway this rack is a great buy if that's all you need it for. The rack easily holds the weight of three kayaks (50-60lbs. each) and I am sure could hold much more. Just buy it and buy a can of spray paint! it took 5 business days to ship to my house in NJ and they came from CA. I emailed the company when I saw I was missing the piece and 5 days later it was at my door step. So if you need the rack for an upcoming trip, order at least 2 weeks in advance so that you can get all the parts. If all you're missing is hardware, go to the hardware store like I did and pick up some bolts. Cost me $3. The nuts that are welded on the rack are standard 3/8-16 thread so very easy to find! good luck and enjoy the adventures with this awesome rack!missing is hardware, go to the hardware store like I did and pick up some bolts.

B000SXCLIS|5|Fits perfectly
B008B5W58Q|4|Very fast shipping. So far so good as far the part goes. 2001 Chevy Impala just has a ton of issues on its on. Just was a bad make that year. Tons of major recalls.
B009E9JIRE|5|WENT TO DEALERSHIP, NO PROBLEM SYNCING..WORKS GREAT !!
B003SWNVI0|5|I bought this and a luggage rack for my jeep. It is well made and it frees up a lot of space inside when we are going camping. Very happy with my purchase.

B0024NSMWY|5|great quality, I am satisfied
B00AR1U5UC|5|arrived very quickly and its well built, great product and great service
B00GA9CNUA|5|nice looking decal - sticks well and adds character to the boat or the vehicle that gets the boat to the water. I put mine on a tackle box, and have had more than one compliment.
B00VQTLGMK|1|It does not fit well makes your car look ugly
B0000AXDOY|5|Have been using this same pump in my Alaska cabin for 14 years with only the sensors going out.

B001TE0IMG|5|Nice product A+
B000C9SU1A|5|I just pulled the 350 5.7L engine from my 1990 Chevy K2500 and replaced it with a 350 from a 1990 Suburban V2500 and they are the exact same blocks. However, the truck has oil cooler lines that run to the radiator and the Suburban engine did not so I had to swap the oil filter adapter over to the replacement engine. Without the oil cooler I would have needed a much larger filter but the fitment guide doesn’t seem to factor in that pretty major difference. I did get the right filter for the oil cooler but it’s much too small to fit the same engine from the Suburban. The old truck engine had some major issues with oil consumption so I went through a lot of oil and changed filters often and went with several of these last year when they were under 5-bucks each and thought the description then stated these had a check valve but I don’t see it now. It was a perfect fit and the price was great so no complaints here but I can see now how easy it is to get the wrong filter.
B000JFHNG0|5|Good gauges
B00ACOB4YA|5|great cover
B000C55XWI|5|Grate OEM fit plus still Made in the USA.
B008P70RGW|4|Super comfortable.. It does run a little small. I got an XL for my boyfriend and it fits him when an XL should be too big. I seen other reviews says it runs small and it does I would get a size up for sure. Other wish perfect very comfortable and heavy great buy
B000C9H156|4|fit was great price was good
B00OO2F6TA|4|bit of a hassle to install (BMW issue, not vendor).  Fixed the gummy worn-out rubber
B00SXVLE6W|5|Fits like a glove
B00VN2YY1K|2|This Honda Logo Folding Windshield Sun Shade did NOT fit my 2009 Honda Accord 4dr.  It does not come with a cutout upper middle section to allow for the rear view mirror and both ends left too much windshield exposed.  My old  two piece cover bought at the Honda dealer at a lower cost covers completely.  I am still using it but will replace it soon with the same type. The Honda Logo looked nice but it did not fit. I went through the return process and my account was credited.  However, I did get this strange call that they received it full of &#34;Soy Sauce&#34;.
B000CODGZU|5|Perfect
B0049U1CZY|5|Great Product!!! fast Shipping!!
B0002SREP4|5|Worked perfect to fix the stripped exhaust threads on my LS2 heads.
B007HRJAQ4|5|It works - excellent product - used when traveling - have no complaints.
B000NTGBI8|5|Looks great thank you!!!
B00RE6KV48|5|This product does exactly what it says! I've used it on a couple of my old leather handbags and they look brand new! I highly recommend this product if you're looking for a fantastic leather renewal/conditioner! This is my honest opinion about this product even though I was able to purchase this at a reduced price for an evaluation of the product. 5 STARS!!!
B001FF5Z4A|5|the correct part for my car
B006ZVM71S|4|Good
B005OL7K4E|5|what else to say? Read the survival guide and stand with the living against the undead!
B00BZ1HHH2|5|Good sticker!
B00HCSBQ7Y|4|Lights works very well
B00EZ9JCX8|4|all the parts were just as I expected and fit well and easy to install thank you!
B00BJEZEL6|5|received when expected and have been put to use in our motorhome.
B0012INT98|2|Not worth the hassle. Couldn't get it securely attached to my car when I had to move across country and finally gave up on it. If you need a rooftop carrier, I'd go with a hardtop.
B00KTHY2DA|5|This replaced my my old 2001 Toyota RAV 4 perfectly! When my original TOYOTA OEM key fob ring broke I fixed it by using a rubber cover but then that broke from pulling it in and out of my pocket. This is so much sleeker and seems sturdy so far. So much cheaper to buy this than spend 100's to buy a brand new fob from a dealer.
B000F5HUQW|4|useful for many applications
B00LNLL9DM|5|Everything worked as advertised! Save me a bunch of money from buying OEM bolts.
B006H5A610|1|It worked for 5 months! A whole 4 months longer than the warranty I guess...The strange thing is it didn't even break really, it just slowly burned out. I bet there's a better one somewhere else. Go buy that one.
B00CFCI404|3|Wish they were deeper to hold water. They won't hold at all. look nice though.
B010H51J20|5|Fits great and works as advertised on my jeep ecodiesel. It'll keep dust and water out of the filler.
B00DVLNQ4C|3|I like these boots quite a bit for their price, but I've had 2 durability problems already in the first 4 months. First off the laces are not very strong quality. Within 2 months I broke the outer sleeve of both laces, but I replaced them with some heavier duty kevlar laces, no big deal. Secondly both of the rear pull loops broke off under only moderate strain, which was disappointing.<br /><br />However, they are still great boots, especially considering their price. Plus the whole ratcheting strap that secures the laces is pretty cool both for aesthetics and making sure your laces dont get caught.
B000RX9KDS|5|GM original equipment to your door step, nice...and fast
B00BUL0DSW|5|Works so well. I am able to keep the battery on my boat charged (along with the sister solar panel).

B00PY93798|5|Have it on my fridge. Thanks. Arrived as promised.
B001AY2WM4|4|good tool
B00CCXW2KY|5|Factory part, factory fit. Bought this because the little nipple on top was cracked, I discovered that the entire bottom was split open. Throttle body was sucking raw air,, rain and snow. Idle and performance much improved. 2002 530i
B0040MC4NK|5|Works great.  Just as advertised.
B003CKH99K|5|Much longer life battery than those available in auto supply stores.
B000C9XYXY|5|Filters good!  Doesn't fade to quickly
B000ZIC18Q|4|Little smaller than what i needed but just fine.  Sounds ok.
B00KTHY91K|3|rating 3 as I am not satisfied 100%, some time need to click 3 times to unlock doors.
B00GB8614E|5|Great product as sdvertised and customer service! Fast shipping. Highly recommended.. Thanks!!
B01015794I|4|Not bad lights for aftermarket.
B00Q34D2HK|1|On first glance it appears to be wood and leather or carbon fiberish... the main problems with this cover is it's plastic and it's fit is awful... before long it cracks and chips up leaving a cover that scratches and can even cut your hands and fingers.. not to mention it looks tacky because of the poor fit on the inner edge..... if it were stitched on so it closed around the wheel, it would be much better.. it would at least look like the wheel is actually constructed of wood and whatever, not a cheap slip on cover that has a huge gap on the inner surfaces.. it look like a bicycle tire stretched around the sheering wheel.. it will look ok from a few feet away.. I rated 1 star (it's really a ZERO ) because when new, or at a quick glance.. it looks &#34;OK at best&#34;...  but upon closer inspection, and a few weeks, it will look shabby and really doesn't emulate a luxurious wheel at all.. pass on this one folks.. for the same price you can get a real leather wrap that you stitch on.. .it will feel and look better.. ... won't look like wood, but this one doesn't either.. maybe at night from the outside of the vehicle looking in.. I bought a used car and it had this wheel cover on it when I got it.. I had to take it off and put a real leather stitched cover on.. now the wheel look like the factory wheel did new.. much better...
B00EKTTXY6|5|My grandson loves this toy. It's his favorite.
B004B61B34|3|Its a hitch, it towed a 20' fishing boat behind a jeep JK 2dr what else is there to say?
B001CA9DC8|5|Excellent replacement for my 2003 Ford Expedition front passenger side regulator. This does NOT include the motor but I was fairly sure I didnt need a new motor.
B000FRV5SO|4|very good product put ordered 6 at this price and car is running great again!!!!
B00KAWSFE6|1|Poor cut, top line not even, did not fit well, inferior quality, still waiting for solution to amend.
B00HLUWN34|5|Bell makes the best helmets in my book.
B00756P3TA|4|product as expected. Service and shipping AWESOME. Buy from them, you'll love the experience.
B008G2236S|5|shipped quickly great fit
B003RW29FW|5|Great and results are awesome
B004VNAKHA|5|The product is working good
B001N883UC|5|I like the foam even better than standard Tri-Flow. The foam pressurizes its way into the tight areas that need the lubrication the most. I had a creaking car door. One little squirt and it (the squeak) was gone. If you need a penetrating spray lubricant, this is the best that I know of. It consistently does what other penetrating lubricants only sometimes accomplish.
B00077ZDUS|5|Item arrived early, does what it should.
B007RHX1QO|5|I had to cut some slits in it, to get them on, but overall they work just fine.
B00IRUQU4A|2|No instructions are included and the wiring colors do not match the wires on the truck, I still have not gotten the lights to properly work, would not recommend this item till this is corrected
B0087NB0ZQ|4|good product, easy to set up
B000G72W1C|5|new replacement bowl
B009AA31DO|1|Control module did not work and I need to return it to get my money refunded.
B00V5NEQAG|2|These lights work fine in flasher (hazard) mode but in turn signal mode they blink fast as if light is burnt. Would need to add a resistor to make them work properly.  I ended up returning them since they were not much brighter than regular bulb I had.<br />Maybe it's my car (Volvo S60) and it works fine on other cars.
B00W4YA492|5|I have just received this product, tried it and love it!  I am short, however I do not like to move my seat all the way forward when I am driving.  Therefore, I am always sitting towards the front of my seat and leaving my back and neck without any support.  The Love Home Premium Memory Form Car Lumbar is very comfortable.  Both the neck pillow and the back support fit me perfectly.  The light gray color looks good with my car's dark gray interior.  I will definitely recommend this product to my friends.
B004BTGG86|5|no complaints fit well good service
B000UJ0VH8|5|It worked perfect. I love it.
B000C59MBQ|5|Great shock.  Perfect for a sagging rear end for expeditions.  Install a little tough for a back yard mechanic.  Would order again
B004I17SBG|5|on time ! Perfect!
B004GY1HEO|2|Its not good, the 3m glue dosent work, and they start to peel off, its not what i expecting for
B00LC06RWM|5|These little things are awesome. Well worth the buy
B00S0CML7U|5|Great product, fit just like it was suppose to and looks great
B00NIJU9AG|5|great tool, and easy to use
B006B25TGQ|1|It is only the front even though they show the front and back.
B00GKNGBXQ|4|Looks awesome but was not cut exact on some corners left a white edge on some cuts
B0002SRDR8|4|good
B000H7DXBO|5|Good battery. It's the same battery that came in it new and that one lasted ten years.
B00Q754Y86|5|Fits very nicely and looks great.
B007KCZD0I|5|Just what i needed.
B006E4SQNY|5|Perfect fit and color
B00O72R7Z8|4|Worked great, UNTIL the relay got wet. Still was able to use the light bar, which is installed on my ATV. Once the relay got wet, when I attempted to turn off the light it wouldn't turn all the way off due to the wet relay. Once I got back home and cleaned the inside of the relay and reconnected it works perfect again. The switch looks like more of an ATV type switch, don't think I'd use it in my truck. *I'm going to silicone the relay to prevent future problems.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works every time using apps on my Windows Lumia phone.  It comes with software but the version is really old so I skipped right to the app store.
B00D3YEGO6|5|This picture doesn't do it justice, its beautiful and I especially loved the sparky caps that come with it. Also, it came with extra parts just in case something got lost.
B0081ZVBDQ|5|This product works real good
B00J15MXJG|3|smaller than I thought
B006WEFFP8|5|Worked as needed. got rid of the AFM
B000C31J9G|1|Said it will fit my vehicle, but didn't.
B00O4ORFY2|5|Still working. Surpassed the life of several cheap hid kits that I have used in the past. Lighting is good. I have installed as fog lights and the color closely matches my low beam hids.
B003CGDSBC|5|Fits our 2001 Jeep Wrangler TJ perfect!
B008YFI636|5|Have used it for awhile now. Challenger R/T Started using mid grade gas and using the STP for the upgrade.Working well for the last 2 years..STP is a good product and pricing is great compared to other name brands. Also a lot cheaper then premium Just updating-Going on about 3 1/2 years. Still use it every fill up. Very happy with this product.
B00480N19K|5|This size is impossible to buy locally. The last brand I bought I was unimpressed with--the light filimant broke within the month. These have been in our van for 4 months and are still going strong. I will use these for all my future auto needs.
B00M0TLQ6Q|5|received a box full of rust - put the blocks of rust into the Evapo-rust pail - left it overnight - next day I had several tools in the pail.<br /><br />Easy to use - easy clean up and does not have an odor.<br /><br />I would suggest any grease be cleaned off before using the evaporust

B006N9I3TW|5|Arrived fast, original packaging, great price, Awesome brand! If you need instructions your pro ably in over your head and I HIGHLY advise to find a mechanic or at least someone that stayed at Holiday last night.  LOL Seriously this ain't no beginner's job!!
B00W437VNA|5|Good quality,  exact fit an fast shipping.
B001AJH1HK|5|Works as expected.
B00F52X712|5|As described, installed in under a minute.
B00F4MQJ5O|4|This thing is bright! Fits perfectly across my roof rails on my 2006 Jeep Commander. You may need to source out bolts for attaching this, depending on your set up. The ones included are very short.<br /><br />My only beef is that the housing isn't watertight. I have condensation on the inside of the glass. I'm dreading taking this apart to seal it up with silicone. Do yourself a favor and seal this up before you get it all mounted. It's decent quality, but the price reveals a major manufacturing shortcut.
B00FH8P1DG|5|for the money. this light bar is perfect!! amazingly bright and durable. I would buy this again
B00DNL05GW|5|Pros : comes with everything you need to use with your solar system. Fairly light weight and small. I assume they have corrected the problem with the plugs receptacles since mine is like any ordinary household receptacle..<br />Cons: the watt meter is not very accurate at least with the load I put on the inverter. 70 watts reads 130 watts. Battery voltage reads high. 13.1 volts reads 13.6<br />Be advised that if you read the voltage at the plug without a true rms meter, it will read 86 volts. This is due to the shape of the chopped waveform. To calculate actual voltage without a true rms meter, multiply the voltage on your meter by 1.4 so, 86 volts is 120 rms.<br />I see no issues when powering lights or appliances.<br />Great product, great price. Hope this helps<br /><br />Update 8-2017 This inverter has withstood the extreme heat of the SC coast. It sits under the roof of my dock which is on salt water, It went through the 90+ mph winds of Hurricane Mathew, it has withstood freezing temperatures, blowing rain and no maintenance. What more can you ask for,,,great customer service. My remote control box went out the other day. Chatted with the manufacture, no questions asked, they sent me a new remote. Just plain ole AWESOME!
B0052SF0LO|5|Provides a great white light when detecting motion.  Great source of light, especially when the electricity is out.
B004XC6QFO|5|worked like a charm and I saved $100 dollars compared to the mechanics quote!
B00DB240MI|5|work fine.....great product
B00KGPB9DQ|4|Easy to install and very good quality
B007EF20GQ|4|So far this product has been great. There was a lot of trial and error issues that I had to overcome for instance, we purchased a spray that would assist in the application but we found that you have to use just the right amount. If you used too much it would slide out of place. If you used too little you risked it folding on itself and ruining the piece or it would adhere to the wrong spot.<br />Other lessons learned was try to make sure you do not stretch the product too much. It will pull away from the edges if you do. We purchased this batch first and loved it but made to many &#34;learning curve errors and the color was slightly not where we wanted it so we had to scrap it and order a fresh batch. The other color was perfect. I would highly recommend it.
B00CUMR97I|3|Good product, however everything clings to it. I also found these at my loca Honda dealership extremely cheaper.
B005NLQAHS|5|Very cool and helpful.
B000KYV1CW|5|Never got it to work.  I don't know if it is broken or the (simple) instructions are wrong.  Update! You need to just get the timing just right to program it. Both keys need to be pushed in sinc (not even a millisecond off).  Its easier if you just keep trying over and over really fast untill you get it.
B000VT59LU|5|product worked great  was a lil hard to install but looked great
B00WID0OEE|4|The plastic blade is not stiff enough to be precise at the edges, but good enough for the shower.
B0039T059U|5|Replace the 55 amp converter with this new 70 amp converter fantastic no more dim lights.
B000MNN4WQ|4|These straps are great, easy to use, and really do the job. The packaging looks like it would be reusable to store the straps when not in use, but after a few attempts, I ended up just trashing it. If the packaging could be re-used as a storage case, I would have given the straps 5 stars.
B001664MFG|5|This is a first class product.  However, someone needs to figure out how to remove the drivers side rear sway bar.  It is lodged in between chassis and the fuel tank with a 18mm nut to remove.  Working . . . . . GOT IT!!! Use an 18mm mid deep socket - a hybrid between a normal and deep socket.  Off it came.   10 seconds with a 20 ton press and the hard work was done.  2 minutes to put back on after applying the supplied lube.  Could not be happier.  Great product.
B003G0S9OA|5|Perfect for our Honda Pilot 2013 model. Great quality. Very easy to fit.
B0023VDL96|5|Perfect fit for my 05 Altima.<br />Shop charged me $50 to installed.
B00MX7TW9I|5|Better than I expected for sure. For 12 bucks, it's a must have. I think it's a cool little detail.
B00KUVPSJ2|4|Installed this in my fifth wheel. Was fairly easy to install - hard part was getting all the old caulking off. Haven't had much opportunity to use it, but it put out some nice air after installation.
B007KSZQU4|5|OEM. Just like I wanted
B000CONZ4C|5|A++++
B0033CKDT0|1|Horrible fit, took my mechanic twice as long to install as it should have, one bracket don't even line up, missing one gasket.
B000K02BEI|5|I was able to find this for the best price on Amazon. It was delivered quick. Through no fault of Amazon, the coil connection housing had two small cracks. All the packaging was in perfect shape, and I conclude this is from the manufacturer. I covered these tiny cracks where the electrical connection plugs in with some sealant. Even if I didn't do this there is no way moisture could enter the unit, I'm just being anal about it. It was easy to install with the help of a few YouTube video's. My car has A/C again and it works great!!
B00JIDKBY0|3|The vinyl is good but there is no background. The image description is misleading. It is white vinyl there is no background at all. It is a good decal though I just adapted and rolled with it. Still looks good and seems durable. Need to get that image changed though.
B001GMX4KY|1|Said it was designed to fit without drilling.  Wanted to install a front mounted hitch on my 2007 Sequoia.  Had to remove the bottom shield.  Bolt holes did not line up.  Had to drill out one hole on each side.  Either I received the wrong hitch for my SUV or company had know idea that the bolt holes were closer together.
B000SL0R9K|4|Wish it had a better pair of tweezers.
B00NFSNAS8|5|Great product - Great customer service.  I will order a 3rd one.
B00WMR1I64|4|connectors were bad, but wiring harness worked great
B00XWDYRXS|5|Arrived quickly.  Programmed on my 2003 Durango without a hitch.
B00480BWCI|1|Do not hold up.
B004GDBVYQ|5|Perfect fit. Easy to install and shipped on time. Thanks
B00W0XCLVQ|5|These are great! Made of heavy gage metal and screws not the cheap ones will see how long the paint last ( well it did not take long for rust to show ! But I will hit them with a little black rust o still love them)
B006KZAJUU|5|works as advertised
B000IYY7S4|1|Poor quality. Inside mesh was torn upon arrival.  Would not recommend buying.
B00FSBE7MI|5|Easy set up and awesome for camping. We put a full size blow up in the bed. Works great
B009S31VVW|5|Easy to install... Saved $100 by buying this product and replacing it myself... fit right into my 2010 Ford Fusion.
B00LNN3MRQ|4|good
B00RM8XOQK|5|Exellent item
B004RCZB38|4|Works as expected. Folds up neatly and into a self contained case
B00L9N7ZVY|3|lights are great but if ur ballast gets a drop of water on em it burns out... good bulb bad ballast...
B0046I3I8I|5|These are awesome! Sit on the tires and cover them completely.  Definitely a must for your RV or trailer.
B002PQS8Q0|5|Fits perfectly, easy to get rid of old poor looking fog lights
B001898U22|5|Nice seat. Super easy install!
B0018NI4LA|2|Too bluky
B00N1LRAX0|5|One was broke as soon as I opened it.. But contacted seller was replaced with ease .. Great item
B00B3UZBSC|4|I repaint Nerf guns in &#34;realistic&#34; themes for Cosplayers who don't like the bright colors of stock guns.  I purchased these paints (in Flat Black) because I had been disappointed in the durability of the primers I had been using.  Often, one good knock against something or repetitious wear was enough to strip off the paint and expose the bright plastic underneath.  Even clearcoats only helped a certain amount.<br /><br />So, I tried these as an undercoat and a way to dye the plastic.  And, lo and behold, they do work better than the primers I was using in making a more durable underlayer.  The flat black is quite a bit more glossy than I like, and doesn't take certain dry-brushed paints very well.  But I was able to solve both of these problems by spraying the primer I was using before over the Duplicolor in those areas which would be exposed.  Now, if dings happen, they pretty much just strip it down to the black Duplicolor rather than all the way to the bright plastic.  This makes touchups much easier.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the other reviewers that these cans do sputter a lot.  Frequent shaking and dabbing excess paint off of the nozzle after a few sprays can help tremendously.  The coat tends to be very light, which can be helpful if you are trying to apply thin wrinkle/drip free layers, but rather poor if you are trying to get good coverage or hit little nooks and crannies.  Also, the smell of the paint is rather strong, and lingers for quite some time afterwards.<br /><br />All in all, I think it works extremely well as a basecoat for Nerf guns, and will certainly be purchasing more in the future.
B000EM70OI|5|This is my second one and recommend it highly to anyone who lives on a gravel road like we do.
B00IN8ED2M|3|Pay attention - I didn't.  This is one cable for the price of two.  The wiring loom is not heat-resistant, it's normal plastic, and the connectors are cheap with loose contacts.  It'll do until I can get it replaced.
B004W4OG0U|1|The headlights went out after 5 hours or less use
B00076RL0O|5|Easy to install, great instructions. Packing could use a little help as the box was patched in a few places and the 2 screws that should have come with the hitch were no where to be found when I unpacked the unit. I suspect they fell out during shipment. The extra plates were there and I was able to install the unit in less than an hour once I got all the truck nuts and bolts loose after a good oil soaking. I would recommend this unit to my friends and family. I have always had good luck with CURT equipment and that is why I continue to trust them and purchase the products I need from them.
B00939KWO8|5|One of the best add-on purchases for my vette.  Great product!!!!!! Easy to install. The instructions on You Tube were actually better than the printed ones. Just take your time.
B00B8EKE4Y|3|nothing special here, it is paint.
B000ALJYEW|5|I had purchased one for myself and then my daughter and son-in-law both wanted one for their vehicles.....you don't realize how much better you can see the traffic beside you till you have one !!
B00LIAOUU2|5|My Son Loves His Apex-Xenon Headlights....Great Product⭐⭐👏👏
B001539BCE|5|Awesome product. Kept 3 laptops and 2 tablets along with phones charging during 12 California trip. Happy kids and wife.
B00GSAUHB8|5|This item works great. Keeps my car cool and is very easy to pop in the windshield. It is a little hard to get back into the little bag it comes with but after a couple times I got the hang of it. The little grip thing included works good but sticks to my phone more than my dash so every time I pick up my phone I have to pull it off but that doesn't really bother me since it was a freebie anyway.
B00GJ1HQUG|1|Installed easy.  Worked great for about a week. Wont be buying Dorman again. You get what you pay for I guess.
B000GZQNC8|5|Very good product you won't be sorry.
B004RDNOTA|5|Easy 2 minute install,lift gate works better than new
B00AQ29ETK|1|WORTH 89.00 my ASS save 64% my ass,  these are the same plastic pieces of junk I could buy at Walmart for 15.00<br />They flew into the pedestrian lane, and into the park and ride hitting vehicles, then when we stopped in the mall to check on the rest of them ANOTHER of them flew off into the parked cars at the mall.<br />Amazon you should be ASHAMED of your selves for ever saying this product was worth 89.00 THAT IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE
B0002SRH60|5|GOOD TOOLS
B0024E2S0U|5|Works just as it should and looks good too!

B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Works very well.
B00JT4HB14|5|Looks very sharp.  Came fairly fast.  You can't lose on these.  Especially for the price👍
B0074EJ5Z6|1|I don't usually write reviews but this is what happened when I tried to put this cover over a 15.5&#34; wheel, with very little force. Not the best quality you get what you pay for.
B00SM8PA2K|2|This item does not fit very well, the release button part of the latch rubs against the arm rest lid and won't latch unless you push it down. It is okay with that exception and I believe that a little work with a heat gun is going to take care of the interference issues.
B002YBYMAM|5|So far so good seems like a quality part installed without issues on 06 X5.
B000EEU0IO|5|great
B002K66FYW|4|Seems to be as good as the Phillips brand.
B003VAWQYY|4|Works well for the rv projects.

B000WJVG7K|5|Enjoy the basics covered. Between this and my Bike-specific manual I can fix most problems.
B000B6AF2G|5|Love this product, amazing delivery, thank you
B005KL84TS|5|Fit like a glove!!
B00BKWTGHK|5|Works extremely well.
B002BHWZFI|2|Does not work very well with eyeglasses. I purchased this for my husband to prevent his eyeglasses from fogging when he was cutting trees and firewood. His glasses continue to fog up even after this product is applied. He says it helps slightly by delaying fog up for only a few more minutes. We will not purchase this product again because it did not prevent eyeglass fog up while doing physical work. The search for a product that actually works will continue.
B00GYDBPL0|5|Very nice and classy looking.
B003177JGM|5|My Wiseco FMC058 fuel management controller is working perfectly. I'm highly satisfied.
B00849VD46|5|works as specified....
B007WFA4T8|5|Installed a shelf in rv bathroom with these and it worked great. Half the price of the other set I was going to buy on here and have been pleased.
B0067F0YYO|5|Great product.  Best multi-fit bag I have bought to date. The size and pocket configuration is perfect for 2 people that have to change layers throughout the day or a good 2 day bag for a solo ride.
B000NSLAIU|5|These are excellent.
B00079FOK0|5|Good fit and does not eat up your face even after 8 hours of use in the heat of a Florida summer.
B00V3VYJXO|5|Excellent customer service!!!!  Stickers are made well and are easy to reapply if needed.  Hopefully the sun won't fade them too bad, I'll post back if and when that happens.
B002NBL54Y|1|Wrong Gasket, Did not fit the 2000 GS400
B00NM1XL0K|5|These LED lights look 10 times better than the stock lights.  They provide a much more natural light in the interior and the backup lights are super bright.  I received one bad backup light but Amazon took care of me and got a new one shipped immediately.
B00KTIQBWY|5|Works perfectly.
B002T0JGZE|5|very cool
B005OLZ3EI|2|does NOT fit a 2015 camry
B00AYEVRWW|1|In CA DMV engine check light HELL!! I really wanted to like this product because that would mean it would have worked and my code would remain deleted and I could pass smog. However after having this installed in my car the problem was not resolved. I had to use the CAP program and take it to a certified CAP repair station. They tested the part and said it was bad and they are replacing it yet again. I don't even want to get into the extra money for a registration extension, an extra smog check, a diagnostic, the car in the shop an extra week to wait on the CA BAR to approve the repairs,  and a lot of aggravation. I just wish this thing had worked so I could have avoided the extra headaches.
B002P37DKK|5|fit good was as advertised
B00O81PFOI|5|Would do business with seller again! Great product! Was a gift & he loved it!

B001CEG90I|1|This does not fit Subaru BRZ/Scion FRS/Toyota GT86.  I don't know why Amazon says it does but it is not even close to the correct size.  The correct filter is CF10549 per the Fram website
B00AZJYDQI|4|fast connect
B00T7CRL0E|2|Somewhat short on seat but fit right up back. Nice quality but just short on seat & cannot hook under seat.
B00559AY7K|5|Just what I needed and it works great and is very small.
