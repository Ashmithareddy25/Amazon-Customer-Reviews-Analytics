B007IXWL2C|5|Love it
B00O3UBB1U|5|How is it possible that 1/2 of the band is gone and it sounds totally like 100% of<br />the band....flawlessly for 40 years.
0812550706|5|The best book I have read in a long time! It is hard to find a book that I enjoy to the point where I can't put it down. This is one. I am interested in reading more in the series. My nephew is 11 and is reading it now, so I think this book wood be good for anyone 11 and up.
B0081L37Z0|1|If I could give this movie zero stars I would. I have never taken the time to write a movie review because I generally enjoy most movies. I decided because this movie was so bad, if I could spend 5 minutes writing a review to hopefully prevent someone from wasting 90 minutes of their life, like I did, it would be worth the time. Please don't waste your money. I rented this because I was a fan of the tv show. This is the worst remake of any tv show I have ever seen. If you enjoy throwing your money away, why don't you waste your money on the lottery or some scratch tickets instead of this movie. The odds of you winning money with your lottery tickets are about as good as you actually enjoying this movie...about 1,000,000 to 1.
B007ZGO7EM|5|easy to use! I like the simplicity of this app. I have never had a problem with it. my kids uae it too.
B006LSZECO|5|Great book
B002MQYOFW|4|You can't stop reading once you start.
B008JGSM6G|1|When I pulled it up to use, it would not go to the program I expected to find to play.
B0089LOG02|5|I couldn't put it down. I was great. Just read it. I hope see wrote. more books as good as this
B0040HO01Y|5|Great acting, great stories.
B00CS74W0C|5|Great books with great characters. I couldn't put the books down. I just might read the series over again!!!! <3
B00846REIS|5|There is a definite and very solid story here that has some tooth to it. I am loving these characters and their lives as complicated as they might be. I like that the maturity is there in their lives but they all have flaws and they work through issues in a realistic way.  These characters are consistent in their actions and it is impressive to have erotica be so detailed in the impressions the readers receive of the characters. This is a great book not just because the erotica makes sense and the progression of their relationship is realistic but mostly because the characters feel real and their coping mechanisms feel genuine.<br /><br />I am also a fan of the fact that the erotica is risque but not to the point of being unrealistic. The author kept in mind that they're still a real couple and no matter how great the sex is there is still a normalcy or familiarity of the sex from one scene to the next. Best of all I loved the non dramatic and perfectly normal way they collared each other. It was sweet and romantic in a modern way.<br /><br />There is so much more to this book than sex. The delivery is so impressive and the writing is amazingly well thought out and I am particularly impressed with the masculine tone of the male characters, especially Cary. Being a bisexual male does not make him any less masculine and I loved that about the writing. The author never once falters while writing Cary's voice he is always himself, never overly feminine or overtly masculine to make up for his dating Terry seriously. Brilliantly done, very respectable characters with real problems.<br /><br />I am definitely a fan of this series now and I cannot wait to read the rest of the books.
B007XKEY6Q|3|its an ok game but now the game will not start on my kindle. I tap on the game Icon the screen turns black and then it goes back to the home screen please fix this!
B001NA6096|4|A fun series. I enjoyed it.
B00FZLFST2|3|There is a mistake.  The back of the blu ray says 52nd classic.  Frozen is the 53rd.  Silly mistake that takes away some of the value of the blu ray case.
0786948523|3|This rule set is based more for table top role players and selling D&D miniatures! I think there trying to sell out and make money! At the heart of old fashioned role play games is the cheap start up cost to play. This is not the case after reading the rule it lends to heavily to needing miniatures to play and miniature mean more money to spend! As a hole game if your just starting in RPGs and have the money buy it! But there are far more better role play games out their and there cheaper!
B004GYY714|5|I love this app. I also love the radio so finding this was awesome. It gets tons of channels and if you hear a song you like you can click it and buy it.
B00J2PFPVI|5|I loved this movie!!!! I rented it since my cousins came over and they wanted to see it. I got to see the movie the next day with one of my little cousins because she came to visit with her mom and I watched it with her and loved the movie and saw it again with my mom. I will purchase the movie soon. Because the movie had trouble loading at the beginning amazon contacted me right away and fixed the problem. Thank you Amazon for having a great rental service !
B0078XGEK2|3|I like to read this book every now and then to help reset my views and perceptions of my problems and frustrations. However it could do without the religious section. On the surface the author tries to appear that he is not pushing religion on you, however keeps suggesting we need to find a way to have religion and science &#34;get along better&#34;. Why? They are two totally separate things.<br /><br />Also it's painfully ironic when in the beginning of the book it is repeated that for mental health you need to maintain a completely honest, undistorted relationship with reality. However in the religious section he suggests we need to be more open to &#34;miracles&#34; if science can't explain something. So silly. That is how religion began. We didn't know how the world worked on a scientific level so we came up with superstitions and religion/magic to explain things.
B00DR0PDNE|5|excelent!!!!!!
B000EGF0NW|4|Very deep, introspective memoir by the author of \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" detailing the effects and aftermath of her rape when she was just 18 years old. I was highly engaged by this book and think it's amazing that the author was able to detail such an awful event with so much soul.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Awesome deal with Lucifer to assemble this cast. Hope the show lasts for a few seasons, but not too many. Don't want to over indulge..
B005CKPQ7A|5|I down loaded season 4 into my Amazon cloud in under 5 minutes and was we were enjoying a crisp, clear HD quality picture.  Season 4 was the best season so far and we are looking forward to season 5.
B00846REIS|4|It was a little slow to start but got better towards the middle to the end. Can't wait for the next book in the series to come out in may 2013 though.
B006MW3UZW|5|Love it
B003XVYLDU|4|I am a big fan of Vonnegut. Ive read three novels and enjoyed each. He is a sad mans Joseph Heller and a definite precursor to Hunter S. Thompson has seen here in Slaughterhouse Five. This is a work which can be and should be read again and again as often as one can take. If one wonders how one can tell such truths without much realism or unnecessary exposition than check this out. Quick, poignant, hilarious, sad, yet cathartic. Great tempo and just a brilliant read.
B00BSBR9N6|4|Learning what love is, and how to love,  is the underlying theme of this novel. Romantic movies are mentioned as a teaching guide. This novel would be perfect for a younger Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Movie. The meaning of love is different for each person, as Rosie and Don ultimately realize.
B00KNWYDU8|5|Oh my god this is so good!!!!!!!! Must get!!!!!!!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5|Was hooked and beat the game.  Really hoping they make more levels.  Would really like to see more apps like this be the free paid app for the day from Amazon.
B008Q1T1IW|5|such a moving film -- and the music is just as touching.<br /><br />Must see -- must hear.  Must have.  : )
1439177724|5|Outstanding story - Very well written. Can't wait for his next book.
B00A80SHFM|5|Loved it as much as the movie, I sometimes walk about singing some of the music especially Do You Hear The People Sing which is actually missing from the soundtrack. It's sought of there in the finale but different.
B005CFWHCC|5|I have this style of Crocs in every color they offer. There are great to wear with dress pants for work or with every day causal wear. Love them!
B000056BOR|5|I love actor Cary Grant & Doris day when they star in roles together great movie I am happy to own a copy on dvd
B0054JZC6E|4|I like it!!! ;) its very fun and I could play it all day long.. like seriously I probably could play it that long lol;)
B002PEP4C8|5|I could not put this book down.  Ms. Sebold's own story as a young rape victim is an inspiring story of survival and very highly recommended.
B009CWWFD2|2|If this was the first Archer book I read I wouldn't have read any of his other books. This one was slow, repetitive with a uneventful ending. I do not recommend this Archer book.
B002V6RB1C|5|One of his best movies
B003XF1XOQ|5|Amazing absolutely amazing. You people that are reading this should totally read this. Or you haven't lived!!!! Trust me people.
B00GH738GS|4|I always talk to the movie screen which embarrasses my husband. This movie, he talked to the movie screen. I loved District 9 so was a fan of the director but not sure if Matt Damon could pull it off. This was better than I thought. Jodie Foster is really talented.
B0052RE4MQ|5|This book is something that mixes the trendy topic of urban literature now that is s dystopian world with something that fresh and new. While the love story between Ky and Cassia is heartwarming and tender, it's is so much more than that. It is about facing reality head on and making your own choices in a place where plan everything for them. A truly amazing read, you won't regret it!
B00OKYQZDI|5|My little girl loved this app.  She had a good time playing it.  She really loved the set-up.  Very fun app right here!
B00EHMFC78|5|Typical gut-wrenching journey.  There were several interesting twists to this novel.
B0053YEM7U|3|Jon, Rick didn't do as much for me as Steve and especially IMHO the greatest Bassist that ever lived the amazing CHRIS SQUIRE  He always had the knack to Hook my ears in all of Yes's music up to and including Going for the one after that I don't know what happened maybe the poppy MTV era and OWNER of a Lonely Heart, something Broke and could never be epoxied back together. I am a Prime member on amazon and I listened to FLY several times I wanted to like it I really did. I was hoping to purchase More of Steve and Chris' work I bought so much of Yes since 1971 in so many formats-remember 8 tracks albums cassettes how about REEL Tapes Yes did have some prerecorded reel tapes namely CTTE and Fragile. Sorry back to my review I found myself nodding off listening to FLY Yes had never done this to me and no its not age No more hooks to grab me and shake me up--I Woke up to TFTO just so hopefully I'll think of YES as still one of the greatest bands to capture my heart through several Albums. I'm sorry it hurts me to feel this way. I cannot give CHRIS and STEVE lower than 3 stars out of my respect and LOVE for what they meant to me as an teen and young adult. Time has caught up with me I'll admit, maybe it caught up with them a little too.
B004UIOUHC|2|I've been using this browser for about two years and it's lately been updated.  They've only made it worse.  Complaint 1:  go to the Web via link from an email and the website doesn't remain or even appear in Opera where you can easily get back to it if you have to leave your email to perform another function like make a phone call.  Complaint 2: it's still too difficult to close a website I'm finished with,  also a complaint with the original Opera.  I wasn't satisfied with the non - updated Opera 's lack of basic functionality and after using the update, I now like it less.
B00005JMCT|3|It wasn't too bad. It had its moments.
B006VRDZ44|5|The actors were great and so was the plot.
B00G5G7K7O|5|OH MY GOODNESS! One of the best Disney movies ever! I will be watching and rewatching this movie for years and years to come. The characters were so much fun, I loved the music, and the whole story was wonderful! WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! :)
0385335482|5|A great book for any one who loves to shop, who has made some horrible decisions with money, jobs, men,  etc. Very amusing.  I laughed out loud at least 20 times...I also enjoyed Shopaholic takes Manhattan, the sequel.

B008MG1E4A|2|Doing what he wanted to do all his life but dissatisfied with leadership and blaming others like a school kid.
B002JCSWV6|4|I actually didn't really like this movie, buy my husband did (he is a rugby fan).
B004LROUNG|3|It was OK, started out well but it really was about lawyers and class action lawsuits.  Not for me, thanks.
B009FXIICK|5|Sound and graphics at first made me think it was an old video game, but game play was similar to bejeweled only with new twist of having to collect a certain number of each animal to level up. Still has the old video game feel and sounds to promote a familiar feeling.
B009H7SCMA|5|When I began reading Gabriella, I immediately decided to take out a piece of scrap paper and write out the multitude of thoughts that came to mind - quirky, shocking, awe, satire, politically incorrect, daring, extreme, intriguing and many more. Over the course of the novel, I came to appreciate the witty, skillful writing and cunning play on this class-war love story.<br /><br />Falling in love, during a cricket match - who would've thought it? And in the manner that Alan Hardy describes. I must say that I am impressed with his writing styles and the layout of this short novel. It takes a very special kind of storyteller to present a potentially offensive piece in such an artistic manner. Granted, there were times I felt myself blush; however, the symbolism was apparent throughout the novel. In fact, I looked forward to the layering of characters and events during the match. Wonderful piece, Mr. Hardy!
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is one of those games that you can not stop playing, it's so much fun for the whole family, you will be addicted.

B00G6ZTM3Y|1|rip off.... cancel my subscription i also want to return the bull_hit fire stick.
B0058VW36U|3|I'm not sure where the hype for this game comes from.  I paid for it but just can't get into it.  I love strategy games but I think it's the pace of the game that I don't care for.
B00B99KJR0|5|The graphics are fabulous! I love the story line that goes along with it.  Very cleaver how they weaved the story in. This is by far the best three match game I have ever played!!!  I hope to see moreover this caliber! !!!
B00F87ZUYG|5|I've loved all four seasons and this one is no different. One word, Norman... Do yourself a favor, watch it, you'll love it.
1616550414|5|This book is great . it tells you the whole story and it wont waste your time.<br />It also has very good quality and its made of great material.<br />I would recommend this to both a newcommer to the franchise and a long-time fan....
B00MO21WAY|5|Gteat story and beautiful setting.  I love Maggie!

B0042TV4IW|5|Love love love!
0345389409|5|I thought this was one of the best books I've read from Anne Rice.  She made you actually think about the devil--whether he was lying to Lestat the whole time and giving him false images or telling the truth and actually needed help.  This book gave you no choice but to think about religion,  not only the good side but the bad.  Anyone who wants a thinking book should read this one.
B00G3HSF7O|2|I was pretty excited about this one because I love all the futuristic dystopian society movies.  This fell pretty short.  It's worth watching I guess and I do feel some ties to District 9 in the look and feel of it but where is the story in all this.  It's well enough acted and decent cinematography/effects but the writing is lousy.
B0055S348W|4|I would love it if it printed to PDF. Or am I missing something. 8/10 would recommend to a friend.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is greater tubes,citys,layers and more greater stuff there are powerful that help you like a freezer Ray.there are different locations like minion beach
B00BZBEL4Y|5|Did a great job bringing the book to life!  Much of the snappy dialogue is verbatim!<br />Acting is terrific.
B004DLPXAO|1|I'm EXTREMELY unhappy. I havenot been able<br />To figure out how to download any of the apps I<br />Purchased into my Andoid I-Pad. Maybe you<br />Folks could e-mail me a phone number for customer support.<br />Thank you
B006OAB3ME|5|This was more than I expected. I did read a review that was not too good, but I thought it was great!
B0041QSZJM|5|I like Pink Martini.  I think their music is different but not off the charts.  Their Christmas CD - Joy to the World - suprised and delighted me.  It had traditional music mixed in with something different.  A good mix.  Was my favorite CD during the Christmas season.
B00M4ADWTK|5|Great story and Angelina Jolie was perfect.
B00G4EXNNM|5|I thought I wrote a review for this cd. I'm NOT a Greenday fan; Nora Jones is someone I listen to. I like her voice but I LOVE THESE TWO TOGETHER! So high fives out to these two knuckleheads for giving the Everly Brothers a different but ENJOYABLE favor!
B00007GZR5|4|When I was 21, I moved to London, and lived in a flatshare where I didn't get on well with my flatmates, and didn't know anyone else.  So some nights after work, I'd go to the bookshop in WHSmith in Victoria train station and flick through the books...where I came across \\"I Am Legend\\" by Richard Matheson - it was so gripping that I read it standing there and then, in the bookshop before even buying it.  Later I sought out books by the same author, and though a completely different book in every way, the same thing happened with \\"What Dreams May Come\\" (one of the most moving books I've ever read - proved to me that I was more of a romatic than I'd admitted to myself, hehe)...    When I recently bought this film (some time later), I was in a somewhat emotionally fragile mood & seeking something uplifting and life affirming (& to restore my confidence in love and romance).  This film was certainly enjoyable, and Robin Williams plays the main character with heart...but the it just fell short of what I was expecting, and hoping for...    Of course the book is in a class of it's own, and this doesn't touch it...but nor was I expecting it to...and unfortunately this film doesn't even reach the lesser standard I was hoping for it.  I would have given this 3 stars, but for the fact that it evokes the memories of the greatness and emotional heights reached by the book...and thus I couldn't give this story any less than 4 stars.
1423183649|5|My son is a big Rick Riordan fan and has read off of the percy jackson books. Except the Blood of Olympus which he got for Christmas in addition to this book
B00DPKQ60A|5|the cd. has very good songs, MY daughter liked the music and the sounds. Finally the time she has to wait for the product was short and I like a  reliable company I can trust.
B00KW23WOC|1|Oh boy, another reboot. This time of the Jack Ryan series. For me, the dumbest part of the movie is using his untrained girlfriend to help on a CIA op. I'm sure that kind of thing happens all the time in real life. It pretty sure doesn't happen in a Tom Clancy book. If you want to watch a movie based on one of Clancy's books you are much better off seeing &#34;Hunt for Red October&#34; or &#34;Patriot Games.&#34;
B00BUCXVPI|4|Well done with a predictable ending.
B000SEIK2S|5|Great universe building.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Funny and sad at the same time. I laughed and cried cussed and cheered. This book left me pondering life.
1416550534|3|I won't get into a narrative about the story as there are many reviews that detail the story.  Reading the reviews; I thought that this book would appeal to me much more than it did.  The story didn't flow smoothly for me.  I kept having to go back and reread several pages to make sure I was on the right track with the story.  I thought the story had lots of potential; but just wasn't well written.  There were times that it got very interesting...then there were times it became boring...then there were times I was completely lost and had to read several pages over to understand where I was in the plot.  All in all I was glad when it was over.
B001KVZ6HK|5|what action, and beyond imagination story..great actors, super story line..and I will watch this one over and over too..even my grqand children like this one...
B005544TRQ|5|I love this show.
B000069HJL|5|Supertramp's double live album from 1980, &quot;Paris,&quot; is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity while they were on tour for their 1979 smash hit album, &quot;Breakfast In America,&quot; at a time when co-leader Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days is highly unlikely, &quot;Paris&quot; becomes all the more an important live document of the band, indeed. Many great Tramp classics are included in this live set, such as &quot;School,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nobody But Me,&quot; &quot;The Logical Song,&quot; &quot;Dreamer,&quot; &quot;Rudy,&quot; &quot;Take The Long Way Home,&quot; &quot;Fool's Overture,&quot; and &quot;Crime Of The Century,&quot; plus one exclusive song, &quot;You Started Laughing,&quot; not found anywhere else. Hodgson &amp; co-leader Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Halliwell on sax, drummer Bob Sibenberg &amp; bassist Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson &amp; Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion. Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. And the album's remastering treatment here is quite a blessing, giving a clarity to this live recording that wasn't heard before. It's almost like being at the concert itself, sitting alongside all of those lucky French Supertramp fans.&quot;Paris&quot; is a fabulous Supertramp concert that you'll want to experience again &amp; again. If you weren't lucky enough to see the band on their most successful tour ever, then listening to this album is definitely the next best thing. Supertramp live in Paris...ooh la la! :-)
B004X4R3FE|5|Great acting, great actors!

B000OCXMAE|3|when i first heard them on their first CD, i couldn't stop listening to them, but with this Album, it doesn't give me that same feeling. I still enjoy the two previous albums more than this one!  <br /> <br />Cons:  <br />* where's the rapping? b/c LP suppose to be a combination of Rap and Rock  <br />now it's just Rock,  <br />* WHERE IS MR.HAN in THIS??? i loveee the scratching of the turntables!!! (very minimum) <br />* does not get me pump up, and i LP sounds use to get all pump up <br /> <br />I wouldn't say it's a waste to get the CD, but if u are expecting the same feeling when u listened to Linkin Park, it's not...  <br /> <br />well that's my 2 cents =P
B008Y5N3O8|5|A classic sales movie. Never gets old! Coffee is for closers!
B00A8KJN14|4|Director Tim Burton takes his live 30 minute film from 1984 and expands it to 87 minutes using his wonderful stop-motion figures similar to those of \\"Nightmare Before Christmas.\\"  Borrowing heavily from the original 1931 \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" (1935) in terms of character names and physical appearance, Burton produces a film that kids and their parents can all enjoy.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) is a middle school kid who stays within himself but has a thirst for science.  His faithful companion is a dog (bull terrier?) named Sparky.  They are always together except when Victor is at school.  Unfortunately Sparky being a dog, likes to chase balls.  One such chase leads him into the street and in front of a car.  Victor is disconsolate as you might expect.<br /><br />In science class, Victor's science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (an homage to Vincent Price voiced by Martin Landau), animates a dead frog using electricity.  This gives Victor the idea of doing the same with Sparky.  Working alone in the attic of the house he shares with his parents (Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short), Victor's experiment works.  As Victor's wannabe friend Edgar `E' Gore (Atticus Shaffer) says \\"your dog is alive!\\"<br /><br />In one cute scene, Sparky nuzzles up to the lady poodle that lives next door.  The poodle that has a mountain of hair trimmed into a cone.  After a nose touch, the lady poodle has those white lightning bolt streaks that appear on Elsa Lanchester's \\"Bride\\" of years ago.  Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) is the name of the little girl that owns the poodle.  When further experiments on various dead creatures owned by Victor's classmates goes horribly wrong, the fun begins.<br /><br />Burton and his screenwriter, John August keep the gruesomeness at a PG level and introduce enough moral-of-the-story awareness to keep the film wholesome enough for most family members.  I loved the wit and the pastiche to the stories of Mary Shelley.  Not to mention the beautiful black and white picture supplied on the Blu ray.<br /><br />With a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the movie looks spectacular.  Contrast and fine detail prevails throughout the film.  This is as good as it gets, as is the terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.  Good use of the LFE channel is deep when it needs to be and silent when it doesn't.  Dialog is well placed and always centered properly.  Extras include a documentary called \\"Miniatures in Motion\\" and a 5 minute piece displaying the excellent art work of the film.  There is also the original live action short, a music video and more.mention the beautiful black and white picture supplied on the Blu ray.<br /><br />With a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the movie looks spectacular.

0374105235|5|Ishmael Beah is a crusader and a recent college graduate speaking out for children affected by war in New York.  His book is about his survival as a soldier fighting in the war in Sierra Leone.  After losing his home and his family in the violence, he  becomes a soldier in the war.  He describes raiding villages, stealing food, and weapons.  He also discusses his addiction to marijuana and cocaine openly too. I felt sad reading this part of the book.  I enjoyed reading about how Ishmael's life changes during  eight months in a rehab  house.  His whole attitude about life changes as he continues his education.  He also starts to make friends and eventually turns away from his violent past.  I enjoyed reading his love of performing and rap music during his rehab period.  I felt hopeful and happy reading this part of the book.  There is a chronology of the history of Sierra Leone at the end of the book.  I thought this part of the book was very interesting.  A Long Way Gone is an excellent read.
0385341067|5|I have been reading avidly for over 40 years and this is the first book I have ever finished and turned immediately back to the beginning to start again. The other reviewers have covered plot and content - all of which are excellent, my enthusiasm is with the writing - if writing can be called 'gorgeous' this is. I want to eat this book. Thank you so much Mr Jones. A fantastic, intelligent, thought provoking, funny, treatise of our complicated humanity.

I really favored the Tenth Sonic Screwdriver, so I looked if they sold some, and sure enough, they did!<br />so after purchasing this product, I was thrilled of how much detail went into it!<br />I had been running around the house, blazing my blue light, and enjoying the noise it makes!<br /><br />Pros<br />-the blue light is very bright!<br />-the four noises it makes are spectacular!<br />-invisible ink is very well hidden, and well, invisible until you shine the Screwdriver's light on it<br />-interchangeable pen and invisible ink nubs<br />-LOTS of detail!!!<br />-the Sonic Screwdiver extends!<br />(to extend it you slide up the button on the side)<br />-comfortable to hold!<br /><br />Cons<br />NONE!!
B0007GAERG|4|This is a good album but not great.  Don't get me wrong, I like this album and I think Mariah is still one of a kind.  It's not excellent, although.   <br /> <br />However, I'll give Mariah Carey her credit.  I'm so glad she rose above all the negative energy that she was facing. Go, Mariah.   <br /> <br />She isn't number 1 for nothing.
B006ON41FC|1|Want work on my Vizio tablet. It just blinks and want quit. This is my first review. I will uninstall as soon as I'm finished.
B004MC8CA2|5|I can use my kindle to stay close to God..I love it!I don't need yo carry my Bible, its all on my kindle.
B000E33W1W|5|This is a great movie that I loved watching when I was a kid.  This is definitely one of the best movies from the 80's - even of all time.  I would recommend getting the double feature instead of this version since it is only $2 more and you get this movie and the sequel.  While the sequel isn't as fabulous as the original, it is still entertaining.    I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good laugh!
B00005JLD4|4|Can't add much to what Chris Luallen said about a good morality story with simplistic characters. I loved the movie nonetheless because of the journey these 3 young girls make across 1500 miles, much of which is desert. I do wish like Chris, that they had gone into more depth of their characters. Not to mention some depth into any of the characters. Not even the school master, the tracker, the people that help them along their sojourn, or any other character with any time on screen. We never feel we really know any of them. Still a great story about how between 1905 and 1970 the Austrailian government took half cast children and made orphans of them. I recommend it as a rental, but you may find it doesn't have much replayability because of the lack of character development.
B0047Y0FGY|4|Very funny. Finished it in one day. She has a great way of endearing us to her with all the self deprecating humor.
B00DMCV7K0|5|Starts slow, ends great!
B008BQ8YHQ|5|This is one of the best shows on TV. Great show. Great characters. Great plot. Sex women. Sexy men. Hammer down.
B00EL8I8IS|5|Very entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5|I don't know a whole lot about this game but, both my kids LOVE playing it! They are age 10 and 13.
B00WP9HSJU|5|Having only recently crawled out from under the large rock that has been my hidey-hole for lo these 63 years, I am forced to confess I only learned about the Oulander book series since the release of the Starz series in 2014.  Since devouring the series through several binge-watching sessions, I decided to read the books while awaiting the release of Season 1 Part 2 on DVD.  Eight long novels and one Outlandish Companion later, I am currently on my second read-through.  To say I might rival Finding Fraser's Emma Sheridan for fanatical fan could be considered an understatement.<br /><br />Simply put, this novel is a delightfully modern tale of adventures of the heart.  I fell in love with Emma Sheridan, her self-depricating humor, her naive blunders and stumbling journey to self acceptance.  And like Gabaldon 's Outlander books, I could not put it down.<br /><br />So, kc, you very clever girl, when is the sequel coming out?  And can I get an autographed copy?  Consider me the president of your geriatric fan club.<br /><br />I can't think of higher praise than that.  Keep writing and I will happily keep reading!
B009NOGSQE|5|Great movie, lots of laughs and fun for the whole family.
B00DF0ZP8Y|3|It amazes me people freak out about silly things. Yes, it is heavy...it's a hard plastic ball filled with water on the end of a narrow stick. If your kid likes to hit things then this isn't for them. Anyways....my daughter is 4 1/2 and loves frozen. She saw this in target and I thought it was kinda cheesy but I am not 4 1/2 lol I saw it on sale from amazon and decided to pick it up for her. Besides the weight which gets heavy for a younger child to carry around, the sound is wayyyy too loud- I can't even tape the backside since the speaker is on some grooves. My daughter's only real complaint is it does not play the whole song (yes it is switched off demo mode). I think if it played more of the song, and maybe if the globe was to light up it would be perfect. I don't think I would spend the 8.99 on it again maybe on sale $5 and under I would consider.
B0086700CM|5|This game is one of the best...it is fun but it is hard, downloaded it on to my new Asus tablet and i just love it. The game looks fairly easy.......dont be fooled ........and I am playing the free one. Wonder how the paid one compares and what it gives you? I may have to find out! If you are looking for great graphics try this one .....get something to drink and take a break you will enjoy spending time with this guy that is running for his life!
B008M4MB8K|5|The movie (director's cut especially) looks great and sounds great. I purchased this for a friend for christmas, mainly cause he's young and needs to learn about the classics. The presentation is nice, small hardcovr book with every version of the movie you can think of with a really nice amount of extras. The artwork in the book is great as well. I have another version of this, and may get this copy in order to get the book itself, great for collecting or for  a conversation piece. I have been getting more blu ray book versions and this one looks great (packaging) and is a must have for any die hard sci fi fans. For literary buffs, although it's based on the Philip K. Dick novel, &#34;do androids dream of electronic sheep&#34; there is a huge huge deviation from the book. So do not prejudge and simply appreciate it for what it is, the movie story line though is compelling There is a lot more depth added as well and so much additional scenes as it's only based on a short story not a full novel. So purists beware. the next part is a spoiler in case u haven't seen it yet. One point of contention betwe4en Harrison Ford and Ridley scott was the &#34;unicorn dream&#34; and how it was suppposed to make us think he is a replicant. Ford says it's better for him to be human, while Ridley seemed to like the ambiguity that it implies. I for one never found the unicorn dream to mean anything. It just seems like  something any man might dream about in a future where animals are priceless commodities. There is the telling of how he wanted an animal for himself but couldn't afford it. so the dream to me didn't imply too much. Maybe cause I am thinking of it in more of a literary sense and not so much as a standalone movie. But other than that this is a definite classic and should be watched and enjoyed by any sci fi fan or harrison ford fan.
B008JFUO72|5|Excellent movie but a bit too much humanity (PTSD) for a superhero.<br />Seems like the real superheroes are the suits. I still recommend adding it to your collection.
B00ECU34ZM|5|great movie I don't usually rate movies but this one was great I recommend watching it if you like that kind of movie
0740785508|5|This book emphasize the need for references.  Its probably what all artists should do.  Its great to know all the creative ways of coming up with references for an artwork.
B0000542D2|1|I saw the 1982 re-issue of this film at CARNEGIE HALL's cinema in NYC--the sound on that presentation was HORRENDOUS--screechy and tinny--like a bad DRIVE-IN theatre speaker! This DVD is just a shambles too--similar poor dynamic range,flat,compressed,lifeless sound. THE BEATLES sounding like THIS? I'll take other reviewers words regarding chopped-off cropping of the picture as well (I don't own the previous AHDN video editions to do my own A/B comparison). I'm shocked this was allowed to happen on such a high profile project.
0792844890|3|hilarious to fault.<br />While the DVD is nothing spectacular, SPACEBALLS itself reveals everything that is the Mel Brooks world of parody. Using a decidedly Star-Wars-Star-Trek flavor, SPACEBALLS allows anyone who grew up in the 1980s a true appreciation of his comedy, as well as the sci-fi adventures that replaced the western.<br />Third best to Brooks's ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, SPACEBALLS delivers sight gag and punctuality not seen since Airplane!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Great game just wish you got lives back faster.  It is a lot better than other guys like it. Great game.
B00C8S9W0G|5|WOW, Diana is the best.
B009BDVD2Q|5|This book is absolutely incredible. Stephen King does a great job creating a story to accompany his wisdom on the subject of writing. A great read for anyone, not just writers.
B00CH26TL8|4|W h end I downloaded this, I thought it was like the one everyone else had, so I was kinda disappointed.after having played for awhile, not a bad game
142312166X|5|a surprise for my son who loves to read bc he is doing so much better in school and he LOVED it.
B0055SWM08|4|definitely worth $.99.  It starts deceptively easy and gets harder and harder to get the perfect score.  Good music as well.
B000EMGAOY|5|I hated this album at first...too many songs, they all sounded the same, I just didn't have the patience... <br />My fourteen-year-old son didn't feel the same way.  He listened and listened to this album, which means I had to as well (and I was so happy it wasn't Fall Out Boy anymore that I didn't argue about it).  Accidentally, I started learning the lyrics. I started to recognize and anticipate those juicy bass and guitar nuggets in the songs... <br />Suddenly, I find myself in the grocery store singing, \\"Stadium Arcadium, a mirror to the moon...\\" Uh-oh, I'm hooked.  Can't wait to check out, get into my car, and blast it. <br />All I can tell you is just let this album get inside.  It is so worth it.  Some of the lyrics are total genius.  You can hear his pain and regret, yet his willingness to accept the past and his excitement about the future. Inspiring. <br />Listen, listen, listen...
B00G2GMRCU|4|I have read everything possible by this author, He is an excellent story teller. I did not like how short the book was. I apperciate an indepth story much more. I felt like I was just getting started when it was finished.This was good if you just want to read for a short time and not having it hanging over your head to finish.

B0001LJCPC|5|As always quentin doesnt dissapoint and in this soundtrack he recruits the help of his long time friend and collaborator robert rodriguez in the malaguena salerosa new version, which to me is the best song of the album.
B000W8HC8I|4|Overall it was a good story but I thought the vulgar language was overdone like so many other movies today.  It did hold my interest though and made me trust Wall Street even less than I used to.  Somewhat on the depressing side knowing this stuff actually goes on.  Have no desire to see the movie.  Probably wouldn't recommend to a friend.
0525953728|5|A book that must be read while relaxing in your easy chair; interesting reading and will throught thru: You have to try it if this is your type t=reading
B00E8KLWB4|5|This game is awesome this game some how helped me notice details better 🙌 it also helps the time pass by a LOT quicker
B00ESNE696|5|Still  fun to follow
0062409859|4|Atticus Finch, Scout, Jem, and Boo Radley were some of my childhood heroes. I loved the book To Kill A Mockingbird, I loved the movie. When this second book was published, a lot of the media came out with angry reviews on the &#34;hate&#34; language that appeared in the book. They castigated Atticus, the deep south, and made me think that Harper Lee had just hoodwinked us all with her first book.<br /><br />I struggled to read this book. I didn't think it was as compelling as the first book, but I believe the media hype (and really, a quite simplistic interpretation) had set my mind against it. I was expecting Atticus to be some kind of demon. But instead, he turns out to be human, subject to the culture in which he lives, and perhaps not as courageous as we all believed him to be. He has one universal truth--the law. This is the only real moral compass he has. So even though he is plagued with the kind of limited thinking a man raised in the deep South during the time he lived in, he could still find courage--as he did in Mockingbird--to follow a commendable course. Following the law, as we see briefly in this book, can also appear unfeeling and uncaring.<br /><br />While many others may disagree with me (and that is indeed what THIS Atticus would want), I found the last chapter, the denouement, to provide and interesting and unexpected twist on humanity, bigotry, and coming of age. In the end, I have to admit, I liked Dr. Finch's message to Scout. And in the end, I think Harper Lee demonstrated the humanity--warts and all--of the human race, and yes, maybe races. Her message is not far off the &#34;assumptive realities&#34; cognitive theorists, anthropologists, and communications gurus recognize. Our worlds are colored, focused, and shaped by the people around us. And as Scout realizes, without drag and lift (tradition and enlightenment), no airplane can soar.<br /><br />Harper Lee hits you right in the gut with a lot of this book. There's a lot of sacred cows gored, some directly, some not so directly. This book requires self-debate, thoughtful reading, contemplation. This book challenges us to try to understand, but not necessarily forgive, prejudices (and faith). I actually think Lee's &#34;explanation&#34; of Atticus Finch could well inform our current culture of political correctness and overwhelming outpouring of being offended by just about everything. Scout learns that bigotry comes in many flavors. not just the &#34;conservative, traditional&#34; side.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this book. The last chapter, and the Dr. Finch/Scout discussion at the end of the book will haunt me for quite some time.
B000002IGP|4|Had this on cassette and needed to get it on cd so it has been great to get back! Great to me!
B004LWZWGA|5|Christian Bale is the perfect batman, also love that I have a digital copy for my other electronic devices.  The only recommendation is to purchase it in Blue ray.
B003ZW0MS0|1|Buddy Guy lays down fine guitar work on this, and it'll send shivers down your spine.  But the record has the sound you'll often hear on newly produced vinyl: thin and scratchy.  Listen to some of the LPs from over 40 years ago and you'll hear the difference: deep bass, full sound and clarity without any scratchiness.  Its like the album was cut superficially (don't buy the BS about '180 gram', which you'll often see touted on the label.)  As I've said before (but have stubbornly bought more new records anyway!), I'm swearing off buying new LPs.  Buy the CD of this one.
B00003CWL6|5|I cannot recall when was the last time I have seen something so brilliant. A masterpiece that touches you wherever you are.. Not just in America.. And thats why its not just an American Beauty.. This is the movie you will  watch and no matter where you are on this planet, you will still be able to  relate. What made this more possible is the genuis script and how it was  written, the incredible way it was directed and the outstanding acting from  everyone who appeared on screen even for seconds. Kevin Spacey is one hell  of an actor who played a very difficult role and mastered it as if he has  been living it for the past 40 years. Kevin, you were incredible. Annette  Bening has managed to make everyone resents her. Doesn't this say how  masterful she was? I can go on forever. Everyone in this movie has  contributed significantly to the enjoyment each one of us in the movie  theatre was feeling. I watched it yesterday, will watch it again today and  I am sure I will go again and again. I am just sitting here waiting to see  how the Acadamy will rate this movie... whether it will touch every judge's  life the same way it touched the lives of all those who have seen it.  Please Hollywood, indulge us more with such sensations.
B0055SWM08|5|It is a both challenging and addicting game.  Well worth the price!  It is a great way to pass the time.
B00BAXFACO|5|I want his new book to come out. It seems jan no one comes out with new books. I why is that.
B00K7C17QW|4|fun way to stimulate observation
B00E8KLWB4|5|This is a very fun game! I like the interactive fun of it all. I would recommend that everyone should try this game!!! I like having different scenes &amp; the different ways of showing the hidden objects.
B003NBFZTE|4|I'm 50 years old and training for my third marathon. The recovery time using this item reduces the time I usually need. This is a quality product and I would recommend it to any distance runner. I give it 4-stars and not 5 only because It is the first article of such gear I've purchased. I would buy it again.
B005CRQ4GU|5|This book was so funny! I read it at least 10 times. I love how it is a diary and not in third person.
B00A0SICYI|4|Great Disney classic! My son loved it.
B008DVJOYG|5|Order arrived on time with no problems.  Satisfied customer
B004TTZHBK|4|I too get the FC as others after getting the 'unlicensed' error message. Shame since otherwise seems like a nice collection of recipes.<br /><br />The app will run without the extra video but that requires saying 'later' each time you open it since the dialog to download the extra data shows every time.<br /><br />I've increased my rating now that the downloading issues are resolved. Its a well thought out interface with plenty of pictures for each recipe. Rotating the phone between portrait and landscape switches between text only or pictures of the steps. Designed to be viewed primarily in portrait with a shift to landscape to view videos and pictures. Nice idea and executed well enough. Trouble is that concept doesn't transfer well to tablet devices. Its a bit of a pain with a 7\\" tablet and pretty much unusable with a 10\\" one.<br /><br />I'm also not sure it really is possible to make these in 20 minutes. Quite a few of them have overlapping steps as in while frying this also cut up that. Perhaps if you've made it a few times before and are familiar with all the steps but I cannot see that happening on a new recipe.
B00280LYHS|5|My 9-year said 'This is the best book ever!'<br />Nuff said, the review wants me to type 4 more words so there.
B000099T2L|1|This is pure garbage. Another one of those horrible RnB singers that all sound exactly the same who practically have to appear naked to get attention. It just shows how pathetic the state of music is these days that this is up for a grammy award.
B009NCM248|5|This whole album is amazing!  I absolutely cannot wait to buy part 2 when it comes out in April.  Corey Taylor is a mad man!
B00E8KLWB4|4|This game has more than just hidden object puzzles.  You can also clear blocks, play the pipes game and more.  Very fun and it keeps it interesting.  Plus you don't have to spend real money to get anywhere.  You can actually accomplish things just by playing the game.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As always a wonderful author with a spellbinding story. When is the sequel, Jake Brigance book 3?
B003XF1XOQ|4|This is a strange book that I don't know how to classifying it because the final it's so strange. One thing is sure us something you don't expect not a million years!!!<br /><br />Also the structure of the book is strange because sometimes the details are so good, but the story has some quick jumps that you can't get a hold of the story.<br /><br />The characters grows more and more erratic and unstables that you don't recognize them anymore.<br /><br />And the love story it didn't have a real good ending by the means that the author destroys everything that could be accounted for a happy ending.
B00CH3DBNQ|1|I wanted to like this book because  I'd like to be better informed about what happened to her and to better understand issues for women in Pakistan.  I admire Malala's efforts to further education for girls.  Since she had the help of journalist Christina Lamb in writing it, I expected her book to be professionally written and compelling.  I did not find that to be the case.  It's going to be hard to make myself finish it.
B00APUYWYA|5|Fun to watch again!
B005LLSZNM|5|Awesome season! Great surprises as always! A+.  I can't wait for season 5 to come out for prime!  Keep'em coming!
0812971825|5|I sank into this book like I would a couch of silk-covered down cushions. I savored word-by-word the life of Reverend Tyler Caskey as he takes up his first church  in a small Vermont town. He brings his somewhat innocent faith and doctrine of total love and acceptance to his flock which embraces him whole-heartedly. They were less enthusiastic about his young wife, Laura, however.<br /><br />The omniscient narrator writes, \\"He had married a summer girl. Almost never- plenty of people would have told you this-was that a good idea. He and married a summer girl from Massachusetts, and that alone brought complications.\\" But when Laura dies shortly after the birth of their second daughter, Caskey slowly crumbles beneath the weight of his grief, the challenge to his faith, and the demands of being a single father. His congregation responds to his stress by exhibiting their own flaws. Through the ensuing struggle, we are introduced to wonderful characters whose minds we enter with incredible ease and whose voices are clearly individual.<br /><br />Abide with Me is Strout's second book and follows Amy and Isabelle (2000), a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Her new book, Olive Kittredge, is getting rave reviews as well and I look forward to reading it. For writers, Abide with Me provides an excellent opportunity to study two elements of craft: writing from the omniscient point-of-view and development of fallible yet sympathetic characters.<br /><br />Peggy Tabor Millin, author of Women, Writing, and Soul-Making<br />[...]
B00005T30L|5|Very Good
B000023VR9|5|This is really cool album with explosive urban beats.  If you are easily offended, however, I would get the edited version.  Still D.R.E. rules the track.This is definetly the rap album of the year.  Plus, amazon.com has  the best rate on the entire internet.
B00C49GQD0|5|It's suspenseful and funny and intriguing.  I have spent the entire day watching it and getting nothing else done.  It's rare I enjoy a show that much.  Can't wait to watch season 2.
B00B2JSRAS|5|Great book. Easy, quick read and makes sense. It contains simple concepts, yet so true that we often fail to see it.
B00JVUAJ2O|5|I love this show
B007ZGO7EM|5|I love this app its the best calculator ever when you have trouble with a problem lllllloooovvvvvee it and I think you'll like it to so press that install button you know you want to
B00ILHW6AG|3|I remember in high school physics we played with a  Van de Graaff generator. You'd place both hands on either side of the largest sphere and as an electrical charge was built up your hair would stick straight out. You didn't want to just let go of the sphere as you could get a heck of a shock, you needed to discharge it first. After reading Revival I now wonder if I have any residual side affects. I love Kings books and am a long time fan but my hair didn't stick out from this one. I was enthralled by the characters but the ending felt like it was a poor conductor.
B00E8KLWB4|3|This game is not to bad.
B0017VV816|5|Great movie
B009SJ3H8Q|5|This program is captivating. What a fun ride and the plot twists are unpredictable. The actors as an ensemble are incredible.<br />Well done.
B0016BPWNM|5|Seeing this movie again recently as an adult after fondly remembering it as a kid, it hasn't lost anything over the years. It remains a very charming, entertaining movie that fans of fantasy movies will enjoy regardless of their age. Starring a young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, the cast of characters also includes a diverse group of puppets from Jim Henson which are brought to life. The story is straightforward, but the characters make the movie very heart-warming and interesting.    Sarah is a teenager forced to babysit her brother who has a rich imagination, reading and acting out parts from a fairy tale which she then accidentally gets herself thrust into. When she wishes the Goblin King would take away her baby brother, he comes and does just that. In order to get the boy back, she must travel to the castle inside the center of a large labyrinth and confront the Goblin King Jareth within 13 hours.     Along her path in the labyrinth, Sarah encounters many different creatures. First she meets Hoggle, a dwarf whom she later discovers is acting under orders of Jareth to sabotage her efforts. Hoggle develops a fondness for Sarah however, and is torn between a desire to help her and his fear of Jareth. Learning that not everything is what it seems, she trusts and befriends Ludo, a giant beast who is actually quite gentle. Finally, she befriends Sir Didymus, a small knight who looks a little like a fox and uses a dog as his steed. There are many other fascinating characters discovered along the way, who are not always friendly.     In addition to the various characters, the movie also features several fun songs from David Bowie. Each song is well-suited to the situation and worked into the movie. Bowie himself is great as Jareth, the menacing (but not exactly scary) Goblin King. The goblins themselves are often silly - though they don't intend to be - and make you laugh. Jennifer Connelly is good in her role, but I think Bowie and the cast of puppets steal theshow. Overall, it's a very enjoyable, fun film.
B001OQCV6A|5|I love this movie<br />Nice spin.<br />I purchased a copy before and this is my second copy.<br />A great movie.

B00GM4H5YM|5|An all time great. Pictures is very good on blu ray.
B007SGLZP8|2|Don't ususally review books, but I feel so strongly about this book that I am sending along my thoughts.  As the author states in the epilog, there was no research and not much else given to the writing of this book, and it shows.  All my friends who have read it, based on the author's name, were also disapointed with the book.  It reads like the author had a deadline, and this is what we got.
B004LOMB2Q|5|I use this on my lap top smartphone and tablet for.everything from personal notes like shopping lists to saving business cards!
B002VECM6S|5|I watched it over and over.   How inspiring!   We need more families like the Toueys !!
B0041T4ML4|4|Excellent character development.  There were no clear lines drawn as to which characters were protagonists and which were antagonists, as the story was told from several different points of view. This made it intriguing right up to the last page.  This was the first book I read by this author, and I believe I will read another from him.

B0071XO8RA|5|I downloaded the first book for free. After reading it, I was hooked. There are times I was bogged down with some of the details but over all it is one of the better scifi books I have read lately.
B0055S348W|1|Wow. What a complete power grab with the latest update. Uninstalling due to insane permissions. Might as well let them follow me around and watch everything I do. All I needed was a print app. What we got was a personal information scrubber.
B009LDCZ7I|5|Very well done!  We were huge fans of 24 and feel this program is just as exciting and addictive.  We even watch the extras and deleted scenes.
B00BSBT8M6|5|My family and I loved this movie.  I wasn't too sure about it at first.  It was one weekend when there was nothing to really rent that we hadn't already seen.  So we decided to watch this and I'm glad we did.  Excellent movie. Will watch again.
B007QA3AH2|5|Fun movie that is campy for any Sci first fan yet not insulting.  Nice way to spend 2 hours any time.

B00DPH7QFM|4|First of all while the description on Amazon says nothing about this, but the DVD credits state that the picture and sound have been restored! (They even name the individual who did it) This can be confirmed by watching the DVD! Much better resolution than the boots circulating for all these years. So, picture and sound are excellent! (although remember this was 20 plus years ago) DTS Surround is no revelation but is reasonable. You will not be dissappointed in those elements. That said, for anyone who's never seen this show there is some odd strobe lights that are a little annoying and contribute to a bit of a busy effect visually. Surely it was impressive live, but on DVD it's a little bit irksome during the first few tunes. The sound mix is close to perfect.<br /><br />The camera work is good throughout though..no quick MTV style editing. Patient and reasonable with the camera edits.<br /><br />I must say Doogie White is spot on vocally. *Another reviwer took issue for my praise of White's performance here. One can be nostalgic about Rainbow vocalists, as they all had their moments, but it is intellectually unfair to compare Doogie to Ian Gillan and David Coverdale. Doogie represents Rainbow at this time, not twenty years earlier! How would Coverdale or Gillan do on \\"Ariel\\"? or the songs from this era? (For me there's a big difference here from watching Ian Gillan struggle with notes and reading lyrics off the floor many years earlier on \\"Hell or High Water\\" dvd!) \\"Hunting Humans\\", \\"Ariel\\", and \\"Black Masquerade\\" make my point and tell the story of Doogies capabilities on the DVD.<br /><br />The keyboardist Paul Morris is amazing. Rainbow has had some great keyboard players but this guy towers over David Stone in an improvisational sense. Watching Stone do his solo spot on the Munich DVD is sad. I always liked Tony Carey for his sound and aggressive style and Don Airey as well, but Morris is really good.<br /><br />The bassist Greg Smith is excellent on this ,and is the best backup singer Rainbow ever had. (by far)<br /><br />Blackmore plays well but really takes it up a couple notches by \\"Temple of the King.\\" After that he gets significantly more inspired and plays amazing! Especaiily on \\"Black Masquerade\\" and \\"Ariel.\\" *There are no long drawn out guitar solo segments like the intros on the Munich DVD.<br /><br />No extras with the DVD but it is a great long set! (Thus the 4 stars) * Would love to have seen the Japanese TV footage of Doogie and Blackmore with the acoustic guitar doing a promo for the album. That would have been a great bonus feature. If you haven't seen this you really should check it out- really cool!><br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I have no regrets in buying this. I highly reccomend this to any Blackmore fan. Thank you for releasing it and please continue the Deluxe Edition Rainbow CD's!<br /><br />(Two flaws..there is no \\"sixteenth century greensleeves.\\" There's kind of a joke version of Greensleeves about drinking but not at all like the album version so don't count on that.) Also there is a snippet of extraneous audio that creeeps in almost as if the into tape re-fires, but it only lasts like 20 seconds so it's not really that big a deal. Kind of sounds like someone turning on a tv in the backgroud while your watching. Short issue. * I don't recommend judging this DVD by listening to the CD of the show. They recently released a CD version and the problem is that this has show has a very live mix to it. It's ROCKPALAST people!

B00002MZ2C|5|Skimming through the reviews, I noticed that there are a lot of comparisons to the other albums by RATM.  While I guess this isn't a bad thing, I am not sure it this is the best way to rate an album for what it's worth.  A lot of multi-album artists give each album it's own feel, kinda its own style.  I think it's particiculary true of RATM, so I'm not going to rate this album on how it stacks up against the other.  I personally own and enjoy all of their albums and at different times, a different album is the one that spends the most time in my CD player.<br />Maybe I have more appreciation for this album then some might.  I have just recently become more serious with writing originals on the guitar so it's something I pay attention to more when listening to music.  I have always been a fan of 60s rock (Cream, Zepplin, Black Sabbath, Jimi, Doors, etc), but have recently found myself really enjoying those psycodelic inspired songs.  To me, Battle of Los Angeles is very reminicsent of Zepplin and Sabbath.  The base of the song is very simple, but strong at the same time.  You definitely FEEL the song.  I find that the repetivness of the melody is kinda of trance like.
B009D5VNLS|5|But it is for an older audience. My daughter is almost 3 and loves a lot of Pixar and Disney movies, this one she couldn't get through. My husband and I loved it though.

0307455920|5|A seamless blend of character-driven love story and commentary on race and culture.  The characters are well-developed, the writing is visual without being overwrought, and the issues raised are thought- and conversation-provoking.  One of the strongest novels I've read in a long time.
B00005CDNI|5|Too much filth has come from the Pop spectre of music as of lately.Repeated formulas, looks, songs and even \\"singers\\" that sound very much alike from one another(!)abound in radio stations for our discomfort.Yet, we have albums like this to remember us of how Pop should be.But i'm afraid that there's nowhere in the scene to be found who can do it at this high level of songcraft. <br />In the context of time, when this album whas released Abba embraced the Disco Music of that era and made it their own, making a masterpiece that can very well be used to dance but should always be viewed as a perfect combination of soaring melodies, choruses and awe inspiring, catchy, memorable music for years to come.Otherwise it can not be explained how we delight ourselves nowadays with it. <br />I will take the opportunity to talk about some jerks who say that Chiquitita is ridiculous and sugary-sweet crap..WHO on earth <br />could say that? A stylish folk-like ballad, high spirited and with several instances of conterpoints and classical played piano a piece of crap? Don't be ignorants, dudes! <br />Buy it for state-of-the-art melodic music entertainment. <br />

B00BMKDTNC|4|Brandon Sanderson has accomplished what I personally believe Robert Jordan was no longer capable of, even if he were still alive: brought Wheel of Time to an acceptable conclusion.<br />As many fans will say, the later volumes of Wheel of Time grew increasingly verbose while at the same time advancing the main storyline very little due to a combination of describing every event in painstaking, mind-numbing detail, and an absolute explosion of subplots.  I once read a transcript of an article Jordan gave before he passed away in which he said he thought he had enough material for a dozen or more books (there were ten at the time) in the main storyline!  (And at the rate he was publishing at the time, he would have needed to live to be around 150 to actually accomplish this).  Since it was only a transcript, I couldn't get a feel for how serious he was at the time, but the last few books he wrote certainly felt like he was trying to stretch things out indefinitely.  This was the main reason I wasn't terribly upset at the thought that the series would forever be incomplete.<br />Sanderson, however, given the clear goal of not just continuing Jordan's work but finishing it (and quickly, comparatively speaking), has, IMHO, done an admirable job.  There are a number of subplots that don't see much - if any - attention, but as I said, there were also an incredible number of them, and Sanderson closed out the ones for the main characters in addition to the main storyline.  A Memory of Light suffers from some of the same verbosity as the other late books in the series, but I think much of that is that so much had to be crammed in, given that there will be no more chances to do so, so i find myself more forgiving than usual in that regard.<br />For long-time readers of Wheel of Time, this is the long awaited conclusion and worth the read, whatever you think about how the series ended up.<br />For Sanderson fans, however, I would recommend steering clear of this for two reasons if you're looking to read something new by him.  First, this isn't really his world, if you will; he was working off of prepared notes left behind by Robert Jordan, and he does a very good job of staying true to the existing canon.  Second, most of the book simply won't make a great deal of sense unless you've read the rest of the series.
0780625129|5|From the beginning, this movie plunges you headlong into the very real and very scary world of racism.  Edward Norton gives a stunning and captivating performance as Derek Vinyard, the neo-Nazi icon in South Venice Beach.  This story describes the confusion experienced by all who live in America's ghettoes.  Derek goes to prison for the gruesome murder of two rival gang members, and returns to the streets of Venice Beach a reformed individual.  His younger brother (Furlong), has been an active participant in the gang since Derek's departure.  Derek's newly reformed outlook on life and race has him focusing on helping his brother leave the gang, and getting his family out of poverty.  Gruesome, riveting, and suspenseful, this movie had me on the edge of my seat until the very end.  It's tragic ending had me in tears.  This movie allows us to view the struggles of life in poverty from the comfort of our couches.  Our actions affect the lives of those around us in ways we may not ever know.
B004DI7HZ6|4|the book has a new twist between a witch and a vampire. I love a good love story that allows my imagination to have a part. Deborah writes allowing the reader to feel the love without having to read all the intimate detail.  I loved it.  Anxious to read number 2.

B00KK0PICK|5|I started reading Marie Kondo's book as soon as I downloaded it and found it hard to stop. Not only was I interested in her idea of how to decide what to keep (versus what to get rid of), but also found the glimpses into the Japanese culture quite fascinating. Our beliefs differ quite a bit, but I still found a number of worthy concepts to apply to my life. Overall, a great read!
B00IIUATDM|5|Bad ass movie
B000M5NRLC|5|Good movie
B000FBFN1U|5|AMAZING can't get enough page after page pure genius the show is great but the books are fantastic 100 times better
B00005OAIE|5|Among all the chaotic anger in the music industry that so many bigoted, so-called &quot;appreciators of music&quot; are defining as prose, it's nice to see a light in the darkness like John Mayer.  On first picking this CD up, I noticed something interesting about the lyrics.  They all seemed to remind me of poems that a third grader would be proud of and would make his parents display them on the refrigerator.  However, on closer inspection, you can't help but smile, especially when you hear them sung.  The songs on this CD, namely &quot;83&quot; &quot;No Such Thing&quot; &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Why Georgia&quot; are nothing but quiet reminiscence on the past, quiet reminisence that has more genius in it than many will give it credit for.  So many times in music, it has been proven that the soft-spoken usually have the most depth, and John Mayer proves that time and again on this CD.  His poetry deals with dealing with growing up, heartbreak, transition into the real world, and the quiet laughter we all enjoyed when we were kids.  If you are heading off to college or are almost finished with high school, this CD will truly speak to you, more than any other CD has.  <br />The music is great, the lyrics really are poetic, and the messages are simple but complex.  Genius.  Too bad there aren't very many artists that can match up to it.
B000H5U832|5|I received my purchase very rapidly and in great condition, as promised.
1419553429|5|Excellent prep couse! Highly recommended!!
B000WQ9UA8|2|First: I'm not a fan, but given the hype surrounding the release of this CD, I had to listen to it and give it an honest chance. I thought...MAYBE, she'll reinvent herself. Other artists before her have done the same - after a scandal, they'll turn around and release something that no one expects, something that truly showcases their talent, and blow everyone away.    Not so in this case: Britney is simply a pawn in the game, and the game is \\"Britney\\". Any \\"artist\\" that takes her or himself too seriously runs the risk of parody, and the 2nd song on this disc, \\"Piece of Me\\" proves that point in spades.   \\"I'm miss lifestyles of the rich and famous  I'm miss Oh my God that Britney's shameless.....  get in line with the paparazzi that's flippin' me off\\"...    When an artist's personal life is under the microscope, it can be written about in ways that can astound. \\"Layla\\" by Eric Clapton - about his affair with his best friend George Harrison's wife - yet, he doesn't feel the need to namedrop himself.  The whole album \\"Rumors\\" by Fleetwood Mac - about the 2 divorces going on in the band, the affairs, the drugs, all the problems they were going through - yet again, no names were called out.  Simply singing about onesself in the first person is uninspired, and a sign that they take themselves WAY too seriously.    That being said, both the lyrics and music on this CD feels like a step backwards.   The other lyrics reek with the banality of today's brand of pop: cheap, easy couplets thrown together with no sense of direction. (Note: using the word \\"motherfu**er\\" today doesn't shock, doesn't offend - if anything, it sounds like one is trying TOO hard to shock & offend.)  Songs about partying, sex, and of course, \\"no one understands me\\". Same old same old.   The music, while being very, very well produced, is repetitive (not in a good way, mind you) and bland. Cookie cutter beats and uninspired solos exactly where they are expected.    I truly wish Ms. Spears had done something off-the-wall - something like a slower release (Norah Jones or Fiona Apple, for example) - that would have blown minds...but I realize that she would alienate the masses of sheep that buy this sort of product - we can't have that, can we? Not lucrative enough. Forget respect, this product is about the $$$, and don't let anyone tell you different.     I think Britney has a decent voice, and that she does indeed have talent - but it's certainly not put to use here. The result is a muddled  affair, void of any true creativity, and reeking of banality.  The first star is for effort, and for the single, \\"Gimmie More\\". It's not half bad for a dance track, but the track itself has no real sustenance. Maybe that's not what the producers were going for, but at this stage in her career, it's make or break.   The second star is for the one  really good song here, \\"Hot as Ice\\". It a good dance track with a very catchy melody, but it reminds me of Parliment meets Cameo (and that's not a bad thing). If the rest of the electropop on this CD was of the caliber of this track, it would have been a more successful venture. Sadly, this is the sole true stand-out.       Sure, this CD will sell like hotcakes for a week or two, then it will drop off the charts, and be forgotten.  Knowing this is probably her last #1 is the fault of both her producers and herself...she had the chance for the comeback, and with \\"Blackout\\", she blew it.

0425263916|5|I have read all of the Crossfire novels so far from Sylvia Day.  I find these much better written than the Fifty Shades of Grey series that I found quite redundant after the first book.  This series has a lot of hot romance and keeps the reader engaged throughout the story.  They are a hard series to put down and I can not wait for the Entwined With You novel that will be coming out in June 2013.
B00QROGCPU|5|Excellent Movie!
6305750750|1|...&quot;Get a life.&quot;<br />Some people have said that the tedious nature, trite dialogue and  wooden characterizations can be forgiven because this is merely 1/6th of the entire Saga.  My friends, I prefer to think of it as two hours of my life that I can never get back. Whether it was 1/8th, 2/15ths or 100% of a story is not important.. what's imprtant was this movie did not reflect ANY of the BASIC elements necessary to create an effective, moving story.  Yes, the choreography was beautiful; yes, the music was good, but I can go to the ballet for that.  TPM did not *move* me.  Its characters did not touch me (except for Darth Maul who sadly was killed at the end; and Anakin's mom who we will probably never see again); its words were so hoary I had to dust myself off every so often; its plot was paper thin as to have deceived one into thinking Roger Corman had his hand in its production.<br />My friends, this is not about the next two movies, or how TPM fits in with the original three..  this is about how TPM stand by itself as a movie, as a story.<br />It does not stand.  It sits there and dares you to be entertained.<br />I for one turned down the dare.
B000TCEU4Q|4|Great for your sim
B008Q07GLW|5|I loved this from the moment it was released in 1969.  When I think of Westerns, a lot of movies come to mind, but this close to the top of the list.  It would be at the top, except the truth of them dying the way they did, makes it so sad.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|I'm addicted!
B00M0YFL8A|5|Bought this as a birthday gift for my wife who is a big Maroon 5 fan.  It has been playing almost nonstop since then.  There is a good chance that if you like their sound, you'll love this album.

B009EE4T8C|5|Watched it a long time ago and just as good today.  The acting is great and the story is amazing and true.
B000MXPE74|5|This is my surprise love of the year so far. I'd heard great things about it, and of course heard the iPod ad song, but still resisted (\\"Flathead\\" might be my least favorite on the album). I finally decided to see what all the hype was about and I have to say, I'm NOT disappointed. This whole CD rocks!
B001UTW7QU|5|Fun, lots of interesting plots and twists.
B004JN1D2I|5|Ready for more. Can't wait for the story to continue. Recommend to anyone who enjoys reading. Dance of dragons next?

B009IJJ5B4|5|Follows the movie and books ever so slightly, just enough so you can grasp who the characters are but adds so so much more!
B00BWBHIUG|5|Very family friendly my 2 year old loves it we play it together all the time my 6 year old plays too!
B00MJANZNI|2|As a fan of action and disaster movies, I had high expectations for this movie. I'll rank it fourth behind Twister, 2012, and The day after tomorrow. One thing that really stands out and confuses me about this movie is the only black character disappears with no explanation.....

B002R88G5E|5|This book will stay with me forever and one I will probably read again at some time, not something I normally do.<br /><br />I was told to read this book for a book club and I have to admit I wasn't really looking forward to it. My preconceived ideas about not only what I thought the book would be about but also the Afghan people and its woman was so far off base. This story is essentially about two womam, about a friendship and about how that friendship gets them through some of the most unimaginable experiences. Things that no woman anywhere in this world should have to endure. Their story touched me greatly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the way the author didn't make this a political statement but at the same time I enjoyed learning a great deal about the history of Afghanastan and its wars.<br /><br />This is my first review and I think that says a lot about how much this book affected me.

B007V4QLOC|5|This group of guys have brought their incredible talents to the public for decades and they never get old for me. Steven Tyler's voice is unique in the music world. That raspy, sometimes soft, sometimes raw vocal tool is just about the best in the industry, imparting raw emotion, teasing sexiness and often a blue humor to their songs. Joe Perry is a guitar God in every sense of the word. In their day, they were long, lean and beautiful to watch. Now in their golden age, they are not so easy on the eyes, but they still are my favorite sound when I need to get my groove on. The fact that we all came from the same area of New England just seals the fact that they feel like home to me whenever they are in my ears. Long live these kings of rock!
B00AE2I4WK|2|What's to say? Too much booty shakin, etc. for my family's taste. Felt the story line could have been stronger.
B008MWBY6W|5|First off, and this isn't a negative, this case is HUGE!  I expected this little rinky-dink case that could fit in the palm of my hand.  I was very wrong.  It IS smaller than your typical camera case but it allows me to take my DSLR with me without having to drag my entire camera bag (on wheels) when I  know I won't be changing lenses or using my other camera.  I have a Nikon 5100 with a 18-55 lens in it.  With room to spare.  (I also own a larger lens:55-300.  I'm sure it would fit in there as well but NOT with the other lens and camera too.)<br /><br />Along with the section for the camera there are three other zippered pockets.  They're small, but convenient.  One of the pockets has sections for two memory cards.  What I do is put my cards in a holder and put it into the same section as my camera.<br /><br />This bag is very sturdy and is meant to protect your very expensive camera.  Lots of cushion!  The nose of it is made of rubber or plastic and protects the lens very well.  Overall, if the camera gets dropped while in this case, I feel it's very protected.<br />Pricewise I feel this is cheap compared to other holster cases.  I've gotten quite a few AmazonBasics items have nothing but good things to say about them.  They're well made and typically cost less than name-brand items.  (They're generic so they should cost less, right?<br /><br />I highly recommend this case to photographers everywhere.  Enjoy!
B00FB13Y74|5|I really like the game. It is so fun!<br /><br />This is my Grandson's comment,  he is the one I downloaded it for and he really enjoys it!
B00FAPF5U0|3|At some levels, you can seem to get &quot;stuck&quot;, but you do learn as you go.<br />More fun to play among &quot;Friends&quot;.
B000009PNY|5|This tribute must have been so much fun to do for the many bands  contributing...think of the original material they had to choose from!  The  Cure doing Depeche Mode!?!  What a concept--they do it brilliantly.  Self's  version of &quot;Shame&quot; is particularly wonderful and more than worthy  of airplay, as are many of the other tracks.  Only a couple of true  disappointments, including Veruca Salt's sleepy and dismal version of the  great &quot;Somebody&quot; and Monster Magnet's off-key and cheesy  &quot;Black Celebration.&quot;  In spite of these, this CD rocks, and will  please true DM fans and casual listeners alike!
B00006J3WH|5|There is no doubt in my mind that the sixth season episode &quot;Once More, With Feeling&quot; was written with Buffy fans in mind.  Definitely out of the ordinary for broadcast television (even UPN), it did something bold, daring, and inventive.  Singing on television?  Who would have imagined?<br />The performances are varied, from Amber (Tara) Benson's soft, sweet voice to the quirky Peter-Brady-esque novelty sound of Nicholas (Xander) Brendon.  Sarah Michelle Geller, despite her Slayer status, is probably the weakest performance, but she tries hard.  They all do.  And that's the point.  This group may not be ready for a concert at Carnegie Hall, but they perform well and add a new dimension to an already great series. Kudos to Joss Whedon for writing such a marvelous script!<br />The CD is high-quality.  For those who have watched the episode repeatedly, you may note some changes.  The sound effects and speaking parts have been edited out, which I have mixed feelings about.  One of my favorite moments in &quot;What You Feel&quot; is when the demon Sweet asks &quot;The Slayer?&quot; to which Dawn replies (in typical teenage fashion), &quot;Ya-huh.&quot;  Unfortunately, this little gem (and a few others) are not on the CD.<br />To make up for what is lost, there are some delightful additions.  &quot;The Parking Ticket&quot; is extended from what is heard in the show.  Likewise, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; does not bleed into &quot;Coda,&quot; but stands on its own.  Perhaps the nicest treat, however, is the inclusion of three tracks from previous episodes including &quot;Restless,&quot; &quot;The Gift,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Hush.&quot;<br />If you are a Buffy fan, this one is a must to add to your collection.  It's great music for reading, driving, or playing Buffy CCG.  Treat yourself to one before Halloween.

B00KGRFV92|5|I really enjoyed this tv series as much as Band of brothers
B00KG2QQKA|5|It's a classic. Everyone should see it.
B003V4AK8E|3|paid ~$20 for this. These days you can get used ps3 controllers for that price. A ps3 controller will have bluetooth. I wanted a remote so I could play emulated games (dolphin, snes, etc.) on my mac osx macbook pro. It works fine otherwise. usb dongle could be smaller.<br />If you want something similar to an xbox controller I would buy this. But if you have no preference I would get a ps3 remote from ebay. They go for ~$10 these days and you can get cooler colors.
B00KA87GCW|4|So far it's a pleasant game.  Neat little quests so far.<br />I don't like how you have to go to friends to complete certain  quests.

B00JQHON74|5|Perfect, Thanks
0756405890|4|You realize about 3/4 through that the book will in fact end with very little resolved. Gotta read the next part, eh.
B00E8JTSVG|5|I loved the second book in the series The Dwellers of Ahwahnee! The author gives us a chance to know each one of her characters as they take on their own voices and perceptions of the events as they unfold. Very well done and kudos for an interesting read!<br /><br />Our queen Oria is more sure of herself as she leads her tribe into the village of lost souls where new revelations are revealed about her past. This is all tied into part two of the book where the evil Ale is back and causing destruction like the world has ever known. Oria and Grey Wolf find each other again only to have tragedy strike once more.<br /><br />On the edge I was left wanting more of this Native American book that is inspiring and full of folklore and action. I cannot wait to read book 3 to see what happens next!
B000002J1H|5|_Going for the One_ is yet another Yes classic.  (In case you're wondering, they'd been racking up &quot;classic points&quot; ever since they released _The Yes Album_).  &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; is one of  their finest moments, with Steve Howe's tender, aching classical guitar --  few bands could ever make a ballad as delicate, as beautiful as this.   &quot;Awaken&quot; is another career highlight -- Wakeman's stately church  organ, Anderson's delicate harp, White's eerily otherworldly tuned  percussion -- it all blends together to create what is surely a  masterpiece.  &quot;Parallels&quot; is an odd song, and some could question  the validity of Squire and White's backup vocal contributions on this song,  but it's good.  Wakeman's church organ is always nice to hear, though it  was used more effectively on &quot;Awaken.&quot;  The title track can wear  thin on the listener after ten consecutive listeners, but it's still a fun  song, and it's not an embarassment.  Plus, the songwriting is actually very  impressive.  &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; is, well, &quot;wonderous&quot;  with an e.  Beautiful.<br />Though I like all the songs, &quot;Awaken&quot;  and &quot;Turn of the Century&quot; are my favorites on the album.  _Going  for the One_ was the last pre-_90125_ record I liked in its entirety --  _Tormato_ had too many embarassing moments, and _Drama_ was literally made  by &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; and &quot;Tempus Fugit.&quot;  I give this  five stars out of five, but it's the last pre-90's Yes album (including  _90125_ that I think deserves such high praise).
B000GCFG7E|4|Good book. Very engrossing
0525478817|4|For me the book started out too slow. I'll admit, I'm likely 12 years over the target audience. But I teach Middle School and wanted to stay up and up on this book my students were reading all over the school... even sitting in rapture through the last 50 pages, in the lunchroom of all places. I thought the beginning went on and on, and I didn't feel for any of the characters. Around halfway, I started to really care. Then I even shed some tears near the end as the story of Hazel and Gus became more realistic and deeper to me. I really cared about them by the end.<br />In terms of storytelling, I was abrupted a few times by some meanderings into AN IMPERIAL AFFAIR and other references to poetry (contrived or pre-written), songs, and characters that never gain traction. Once the story became just about Hazel and Gus, it seemed to move along more smoothly.<br /><br />Last thing. Our school librarian said this book was recommended for 8th grade and up. I would agree, there are at least two specific references to sexual activity beyond the norm of younger students. Parents may want to read along just in case it will open the door to some family conversations.
B00K2CHWYI|5|Loved the movie....easily the best of the year so far and one of Cruise's best performances in recent years. I find it surprising that it didn't do better at the box office but maybe that's more of a marketing issue than the movie itself. Thoroughly enjoyed it - so much that I felt compelled to write my first movie review here.

B005ZOBNOI|5|Not the typical cancer love story. It was more than just two teenagers in love. It was also about questioning the universe and what role people want to play in the universe. If it's really important to leave a mark in the world and if people would care. Truly inspiring.
B00005JP9V|5|At twelve o'clock (in SF) on weekdays an interview program comes on PBS called \\"The Charlie Rose Show.\\"  A couple days before Christmas, three Mexican directors were on the show: Alfonso Cuarón, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Guillermo del Toro.  Mostly they talked about their friendship and how they sometimes collaborate on each others' films, and they also talked about their newest films; \\"Babel\\" (Iñárritu), \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" (Del Toro), and \\"Children of Men\\" (Cuarón).  The latter film interested me the most from the clips that were showcased and what Cuarón said about the film.  The most intriguing thing he mentioned was that he preferred not to do close-ups to create the drama, but that he liked to back off and let the actors make their own, real drama, instead of having to synthesize it.     Subsequently I went to see \\"Children of Men,\\" right before school reconvened, and not only does Cuarón accomplish that, but he manages to make everything seem as though it is actually happening, that you are looking though a screen into a real world.  Everything that happens fits into that world and expands its realm beyond the plot line.  Part of how he accomplishes that is the details that Cuarón inserts, such as cynical comments graffitied on walls, and advertising for a commercial suicide drink called \\"Quietus\\" accompanied with the slogan \\"You decide when it's time.\\"  Another impressive aspect of this movie, for not many directors are able to do this well, is the cinematography.  Cuarón pulls off myriad styles of shooting such as steady-cam shots, scenes where the camera is off-center, hand-held camera work, and an incredible nine minute shot with no cuts, that maintains the suspense of the shot masterfully.     One of the best scenes is the opening scene which is brilliantly done, for Cuarón establishes the setting and the tone of the movie within the first minute.  It starts out with a blank screen and a voice announcing the death of the world's youngestperson, aged 18, for no one has been born since 2009 due to the infertility of all women in the world.  Then suddenly an image appears of a crowded coffee shop with everyone looking up at a television, which bears the sad tidings.  You then see Theo (Clive Owen) enter the coffee shop and start pushing through the crowd to order a coffee.  He momentarily looks up at the screen, then takes his coffee and walks outside, with a subtitle at the bottom of the screen proclaiming the date to be November 2027 in London.  He walks down the street a little and stops to put some alcohol in his coffee as the camera circles around him, when the coffee shop he was just in explodes, and a woman walks out holding her severed arm right before the screen turns black, and the title of the film is displayed in bold, white letters.     From that first scene the tone is set, and details begin to be filled in when metro trains are attacked by angry rioters, piles of dead cattle are seen aflame in the countryside, signifying the continuous presence of mad cow disease in England, and cages filled with illegal immigrants can be seen everywhere, even on platforms for the Underground (the British metro rail).  The only escape from the outside world is in Theo's friend Jasper's house, hidden away in the woods off of the highway somewhere in the countryside.  The story progresses as Theo is abducted by an underground group called \\"The Fishes,\\" led now by his ex-wife Julian (Julianne Moore).  She asks him to obtain transit papers for a girl in exchange for five thousand pounds.  He declines at first, but later decides to do it, and gets the transit papers from his cousin who works for the government.  After that, the situation gets worse and worse as Theo begins to find out the whole truth.     While the movie is extremely enjoyable, the plot obviously isn't pertinent to life nowadays, unlike other sophisticated films, such as \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" (excellent film), and \\"Syriana.\\"  However, the movie manages to address many topics that are relevant to today without obstructing the flow of the film, such as the issues of illegal immigration, cruel and unusual punishment, and to a smaller degree the quality of our food, which has become a bigger issue since the recent outbreaks of e coli poisoning.     Most of the aspects that make this movie good I have mentioned in passing, but what truly makes this movie great is how it all comes together.  Everything; the details, the acting, the special effects, the camera work, all come together and function beautifully in regards to each other.  This is a unifying aspect of all movies that are considered to be masterpieces of film making.  The Lord of the Rings Trilogy would never have been considered a great epic if the acting and the special effects had not been so unified, nor would any of Akira Kurosawa's films have been so wonderful if he had not had such excellent actors and plot lines to work with.  I definitely recommend seeing this movie, for this truly is an example of great film making, and seeing Clive Owen at work is always a pleasure.

B00L8OBCQS|2|Lazy writers. I don't normally give ugh reviews but man I had my hopes up there with this one!! The previews looked wicked. I loved off of them for months before the release and then came the release and I watched it. And I watched it again because maybe it was like the first time I saw Bad Lieutenant in 1993 at the movies, I hatedmit but then I worshipped it but no,doing with this sequel. It was bad all around. Bad writing. Bad story. SPOILER. and FYI Hollywood, not all women need to be gang raped to be ruthless strong warriors. It's such an easy out for writing to pen that backstory in. Two stars and falling.
B0071XO8RA|5|I found this on my 'pad, having bought the Kindle edition I guess because it was cheap and someone had mentioned it in passing, and then I forgot about it.  Started to read it and was instantly engrossed, and only now looking at the Amazon page again do I realize / remember that it's one of those self-published eBooks.  It's polished and professional, and well worth a whole lot more (especially for the Omnibus!).<br /><br />This is really good writing.  It's more psychological than hard SF; the science is certainly nothing amazing (come to think of it, the main high-tech gadget is the radio), but it's also not one of those mushy slow-moving self-indulgent psychological things.  The writing is crisp, and the plot flows at a sometimes breathtaking clip.  (Do be warned that the author does not hesitate to kill off main characters!  There are always more, equally memorable, waiting in the wings to smoothly take over.)<br /><br />Very, very good use of SF techniques to explore (without hitting you over the head with it) love and fear and hatred and group dynamics and the necessity of necessary evil, and all SORTS of stuff.  And just like life, at the end we haven't quite found out what's going on; but it's still eminently satisfying.

0765348276|4|John Perry is an old man. His wife is dead, and he's joining the military. ??? Certainly an interesting premise already, but it gets better.<br /><br />Scalzi's main character is intelligent, with a wry sense of humor and maintains a humble likability as he rises through the ranks. An imperfect past grounds him and make him real, while the passion and love he felt for his wife never waivers. Which is good, because this is a very personal struggle by one man. And if he didn't sell the book on his own standing, there'd be trouble.<br /><br />The technology ideas here may be old hat to some, but Scalzi uses them superbly--integrating them and making them a very real part of life and military maneuvers.<br /><br />Cybernetic implants? Check.<br />Nanotech? Check.<br />Enhanced strength and speed? Check.<br />Green skin? Uh...you'll see.<br /><br />There's more, but despite a couple bits, nothing was jaw-dropping different. But it didn't need to be. Really illustrates how important execution is. A good idea is nice, but will get you nowhere if you can't sell it within the story. We're past the day and age when an interesting idea can make a sci-fi novel; there need to be deep characters, a convincing setting and it needs to all...work.<br /><br />Humor is a solid reason to read this book. If you're not laughing through their version of Boot Camp, then something is wrong with you (or perhaps Twilight is more your fort&eacute;--yes...I went there...).<br /><br />My one real complaint with Old Man's War would be its lack of description. On the other hand, the narration is concise, amusing, and it makes the pages fly! There is no fluff in this book! Yes, I wished it had been longer and more detailed, but this is more a testament to Scalzi's skill than a lack of sheer book to read. So, in most regards, it makes up for its sparse detail. However, due to its brevity and the large jumps in time the narrative can take, the reader is sometimes left with the White Room effect. (If not commonly known, I've heard reference to this before and it is simply the loss of connection to the setting and surrounding stimuli. This makes you feel like the current conversation is taking place in a Matrix-like loading space--and not in a cool way.) It is a testament to the quality of the dialogue, story and well-used technology that this is not a bigger issue.<br /><br />The story's setting is huge with a propensity for an EPIC story. There are large scale battles and conflicts, cliff hangers, aliens up the wazoo, but it is not Space Opera. It is one man's journey. That's it. I didn't find this to be a failing, but I did find it jarring when I realized the end was coming near and there was nothing earth-shattering in its conclusion.<br /><br />Satisfying, but not earth-shattering.<br /><br />Usually I love my stories to be epic and I like my endings to be monumental. This might have resulted as a fail for me in another book, but Old Man's War was just...different. I can't help but wish there had been more. Oh wait, there are more books set in the same universe. Ah. Well played, Scalzi. Well played...<br /><br />As a first book it is phenomenal, quick to read and leaves you antsy for more. What else could Scalzi have wanted for his first foray into fiction? It gets a solid 4.5 stars from me. I may be late to the game here and telling you what you already know, but for anyone that hasn't read Old Man's War...

B008XX6J4C|5|These guys are the best ever. They inspire me to play music again. The pure joy and emotion from The Piano Guys is amazing. You'll love this music!
B0014E9188|3|I have to admit, I'm more interested in THE INCIDENT and BLANK PLANET albums, but PT is a VERY TIGHT live combo, and always sound terrific. This concert video, for me, is a really entertaining overview of  some of the material they were doing ten years or so ago up to DEADWING. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who's not interested in their earlier music.      PT has very a straightforward approach compared to other artists that fall into the progressive category: very clean production sounds, along with melodies and vocal stylings that are very smooth and well-crafted. They excel at composing arrangements that always do a nice job of showing variations in range, pitch, rhythm, and the ability to effectively switch from very soft & quiet to very heavy, powerful and loud. Their greatest strength, I believe, is this: there is never anything on a PT album that they cannot perform or reproduce in concert; I personally take great stock in how good a band is at such a thing. It's a very important trait in regard to being a good live band, and that characteristic is in full display in this video. I just wish they would release a video with more of the recent music being performed.
B00B4VI8MQ|5|Fun to play on a boring evening. I like all the little hidden objects and feel of the game with a story line.

B00ARAN9JW|3|Good way to pass the time, the plot wasn't too complex.  It was by no means the greatest movie ever.
B00006RAKP|4|I initially did not purchase this collection as I went by the negative reviews that stated that the sound quality is poor. But after a while I decided to give it a try anyway as I noticed that these reviewers numbered in the few. After giving this a listen, I have to disagree with the exaggerated reviews. Yes, there are some tracks that are a little bit louder than the rest such as Nikita. But it is not so bad that you will have to reduce the volume. Even if you do play your stereo loud, I don't think that you will have to constantly reduce the volume.<br />As far as the review that stated that this collection sounds \\"noisy\\" or \\"limp\\", that cannot be further from the truth. They sound fine to me. Now, the sound quality is not as well done as The Very Best of The Eagles or The Essential Kenny Loggins, but the sound quality is fine with me. Yes, there is an obvious difference in sound quality between the older material and the newer ones but that is to be expected on compilations like this. It is obvious from listening to this album that it was not remastered much if at all. And, yes, the sound is a bit \\"loud\\" on the older material as if the engineer simply amplified all the levels and called it a day but it is not so bad that it is not listenable. A review stated that this collection will not sound good on a decent stereo but on my Definitives, and these speakers are renowned for their sound reproduction, they sounded okay. And I am very picky about sound quality and that's why I normally don't listen to music recorded in MP3 format or the like. I have Bose surround speakers and I don't use them to listen to music as the Definitives  produce a much more realistic sound.<br />I am a big fan of Elton John and have just about all of his albums and compilations. I even have his Rocket Man-Number Ones which I got just to add to my collection. That collection, by the way, is very limited and seems lacking as it has only 17 tracks. The only track that Rocket Man has that this collection does not have is \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" which is actually a cover of a song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Greatest Hits 1970-2002, on the other hand, has most of Elton John's greatest hits, 34 of them to be exact. Of course, you cannot fit all of his greatest hits on two discs which is what this is. A more encompassing greatest hits collection would at least have four discs. But then you probably would not be getting it unless you don't already have all of his albums or just want to add it to your collection. I purchased this particular collection because I wanted to have all of my favorites on two discs handy. Sometimes I don't want to go searching for one of his albums in my library. Sometimes I just want all of his best in one place. And this definitely fits the bill. I do have the previous greatest hits but they did not have all the best in one place. I would have to bring out Greatest Hits Volume 1, Volume 2, Greatest Hits 1976-1986, Rocket Man-Number Ones (just for \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\") and Love Songs just to get all the songs on this package.<br />I am very glad that I went ahead and purchased this collection. Yes, I understand that Elton John puts out a greatest hits or compilation often. But he does have an addiction for shopping and so a quick repackaging of his material is a quick way for him to make some cash. I have no problem with that. To each his own. For those who are looking for a better remastered collection, you will have to wait for that one. In the meantime, this one will do for me.
0991379659|5|Great trilogy.  Loved reading these books.  We should all have a Hudson!
B001CWOCUO|2|Its not DTS Master audio.<br />I am really disappointed because its sounds and looks like a reg dvd, not a blu-ray.<br />Dont wast your money on blu-ray.
B005KAH7QU|3|Cate Blanchett is the worst part of this movie. She's a very good actress, but her attempt at a Southern American accent was not even funny, it was nauseating. Even her double in the holding cell (Downton Abbey's Mary) can't do the accent at all & the result is laughable. The whole movie (minus the beginning) is entertaining, but there are many plot holes that leave you asking questions that should have been answered in the film. Its strongest aspect is the young protagonist, whose accent didn't bother me. As the movie appeared to have been filmed in multiple countries, the scenery was another of the film's assets.

It is not even watchable. It was so bad in fact, I had to ask for a refund. The first time I have ever asked for my money back. Do not waste your time.

015206057X|3|...because not quite EVERY baby has ten little fingers...we received this as a gift from a friend's mother for our baby shower, and thought it was quite cute.  Ironically enough, our son was born with TWELVE fingers, because uncomplicated polydactyly runs in my husband's family.  While this surprised us (it seemed to have skipped my husband's generation, which it's not supposed to do), it wasn't a big deal, as the fingers were little more than skin tags, and easily removed at 6 months of age; however, it did make this book a little inappropriate/awkward for our son, as we don't want him feeling excluded, since he once had two extra!  A great book, just wait until baby shows up (and a thorough digit count has been done!) to buy it...
B0034G4OYA|5|This is a really  great movie.<br />I enjoy watch good movies with my kids.<br />I would recommend this to everyone.
B00E8KLWB4|3|Game is O.K., but the story doesn't flow smoothly like other hidden object games.  Once you find all the objects in a particular level your taken back to the main screen.  It should take you to the next level.  It gets a little monotonous.

B002VKE1K2|3|Two fine relatively inexperienced actors and director, produce a  \\"realistic\\" ghost story which will please many viewers and displease many as well. Completely unaware of anything about the movie save what is suggested by the title, I was caught up in the daily  life of the two characters, and only gradually began to understand the nature of the picture. Yes, it seemed to drag at times but that, in itself, is  part of the plot and the experience of watching the story unfold. I liked it. I understand why others will not like it. Until the very end, nothing really happens. Clearly that was the intent of the creators. The two actors make it work, seem entirely in synch with the intentions of the writers and director. Given the gamble that watching a film like this, which will elicit such different responses, viewers are advised not to make this the key feature of a group (two or more people) evening at the television.
B002UM5BXW|4|I did not enjoy all of this book.  I did enjoy some of it.  It is a peek behind the scenes of the life of a rough and tough and famous chef.  I am glad I read it, but it was time to move on somewhere else and to someone who is (to me, at least) more normal.
B00001ZWTT|1|The great Ross Martin is flipping in his tomb, he's flipping off the producers of this monstrosity. The only way a film can be this bad is to do it on purpose-with millions of dollars to flush down the toilet and somehow be able to write it all off on taxes. The man with his hand on the flusher was none other than Will Smith, who when he was cast, racism had to be wrote into the script. Mel Gibson was considered, but Patrick Swayze would have been perfect. Swayze was near Conrad's size, was good at martial arts, and a very good actor. Will Smith fans don't care if his movies are any good, they just show up to see him-because he is so &#34;likeable&#34; and for some reason they like to chew bubblegum and text message all the way through each and every one of his blockbusters. Why has this not showed up on mystery science theater 3000? It is because more people have seen the Gamera flying turtle movies than have seen this (no disrespect intended for floppy rubber turtles swinging from piano wire).
0140157352|5|The authors propose that all the world's difficulties could be resolved if only parties adhered to the principles of negotiation outlined in this book.  I doubt, of course, that the Israelis and Palenstinians, for example, could find an ever-lasting peace simply by adhering to the principles laid out in this book.  Such thinking is reductive, naive and quite possibly arrogant.  In any event, that caveat aside, what the authors present is an interesting set of tools one can use in negotiating with another party.  While most people will find themselves negotiating in situations far less dire than that of the Israelis and Palestinians (a business deal, a divorce, inheritances, etc.), the tools _in theory_ are applicable everywhere.  However, the authors fail to prove that the tools are _in practice_ applicable everywhere.  This failure to prove the tools' applicability in practice may be attributable to the authors' hailing from the theoretical shield of academia.

B00AL1P9PY|5|One of their very best!
B008Y2FRFO|4|Quite fun, as long as I am satisfied with 5 or 10 min of play before I run out of coins. Need to PAY to play longer. Short is sweet. Longer would be better.
B00846F1YW|5|This was one of the best hidden object's games I have played.  I suggest everyone consider purchasing this game.  It will give you hours of fun.
B004SJ3BCI|5|great game, and its FREE!!<br />I recommend this to any angry birds fans.<br />It's as usual always fun and angry!!
B002ZG97LK|5|Love the movie I think it was almost as good as the first one.  Would say that you should have both
B00ESCJG1U|3|Found app to slow me down when taking pic and adding file to text. Also often found that I preferred the picture as it was taken with my LG G Vista over the enhanced version. Ok product if you like experimenting.
B0060D15AK|5|Awesome movie would recommend this movie to others.  Bought and Downloaded to my kindle. watched many times now.  . . Sandra Bullock is an awesome actress.
B00HUCF6KK|5|Can't wait for season 2! My husband and I couldn't stop watching it.
B003L77G2Y|5|I really love fringe since the first time I saw it, it is facinating the best show I have ever seen I hope to get the season 3 on dvd for xmas
B00BR4QNJ0|4|My sons really like this game and have fun playing it.
B00H5KRPD8|5|Best season.
B0077SGMXM|5|I have spent a lot of time playing this over the past few months. I love phone games where I can just pick it up, play a bit, and then set it down. The later stages get very challenging which keeps the game fun.
0440219078|5|I read the book The Giver(a science fiction book)by Lois Lowry.I thought this bbok had many different outlooks on life.The Giver is about a tewlve year old boy named Joans.Joans lives in a so called &quot;perfect world&quot;.In the community he and his family and friends live in, they  see everything in black and white.No one that lives in this community has  feelings either.In this so called &quot;perfect world&quot; a boy inhabits  a seemingly ideal world:a world without  conflict,proverty,unemployment,devorice,injustice,or inequality.Teenage  rebellion is unheard of and even good manners are a way of life.    When  the children in the community turn twelve they receive a life assignment  determined by the Elders. I thought it was sad the way that no one in the community could  feel love or know fear,or behave different from the rest of society.I hope  our society will never end up in such an existence.When I read this book,I  asked my self ...If things were always done that way,than why change?One  thing that I thought was very impoartant was how in The Giver they stresed  that happy feelings always come with sad feelings,and that love comes with  hate.Also,learning never stops.A question Lois Lowry asked in this book was  can people be happy without feelings?I thought about that question for some  time know.I don't think that you can be happy without having feelings  because happiness is an emotion.Readers will need to decise that question  for them selves. I really enjoyed this book!I think that any  person twelve or older should read it, just to get a different perspective  on life.I hope Lois Lowry writes a sequel to The Giver!
B00NJT3A5Q|5|One of the best Christmas albums I have ever heard. It is amazing that they make the sound that they do without instruments or electronics. Simply amazing.
B006AZZPCM|1|This downloads but finding the downloaded videos is impossible. I am not sure how this got a high rating but it does not work. I guess you really do get what you pay for.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|What was the Husband's Secret compelling you in to keep reading? Tess, Felicity, Cecelia, and Rachel pull off their domestic and protective shields in their ordinary lives to allow a thrilling edge to cut through the certainty of what they positively knew. What might have been if they made other choices? A really enjoyable read.
B00W3V83QW|5|Bubble Witch Saga 2 is so enjoyable I play it all of the devices I have! When I'm sneaking in a level or two at work, the Sound is muted and I really miss the Sound  Effects. They remind me winning on the slot machines!!! I can't get enough of this game, it's addictive.
B004WDRT1Y|5|Excellent
B00A3NQNUU|4|Dragonvale gets addictive. Once I had a lot of stuff on my islands it took up a lot of space. It took up 810mb of space.  Then I had to delete the app.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|Grisham always tells a good story.  This was easy reading and an interesting premise.  I may have learned a little more than I wished about wills and the law, but the important this is I discovered new information!
B001B6PBBK|3|It's an okay movie. Very light.  Not remarkable or memorable, just cute.  If you're looking for a fluff piece, try this one.
B0036S4B6M|5|It was well written and an easy read.  I read this after watching the Netflix version.  It was a little hard to follow the track of who is which character because most of the names are different.  The book appears to be more realistic and the Netflix show is more sensationalized.  Although in prison, Piper is a likeable character.
B00QW8TYWO|4|Why did the  poppy pigeon cross the road?To get a high score! Best game I got for my kindle fire HD.
B001HN6922|1|Pixar blew it with this one. They shove the political agenda that Big Oil is evil. That's the entire plot. The bad guys are cars that run on gasoline (lemons, clunkers) who want alternative fuel banned so they plan to kill all the cars who use &#34;green fuel.&#34;<br /><br />There's no character growth in Cars 2, no one learns a lesson. Lightning is cruel to Mater. If that's not enough, there's violence in every scene: guns, lasers, missiles, bombs, explosions, spies, and a torture scene. You're also treated to several death scenes and a few near-death scenes. Mater nearly gets blown up when the bad guys plant a bomb on him. Other cars are blown up while the bad guys chant, &#34;kill him!&#34; A few bar scenes and alcohol use. Inappropriate adult jokes such as where one car commenting on how cute another car is says, &#34;I need some coolant!&#34;<br /><br />Seriously? What were you thinking Pixar?
B000000WJZ|5|The Pumpkins' follow-up to GISH is right up there with AENIMA and OK COMPUTER as one of the top five albums of the 1990's. From the album's five-star average you can probably surmise that this is an exceptionally good record, so I won't spend any time raving. Even despite Billy's unusual (if at times annoying) vocals, the sheer power and range of this music, which remains very melodic and well-written at all times, shoves NEVERMIND, TEN, and possibly even DIRT out of the way as the best Grunge-era album.<br />The main singles from this album are \\"Today\\" and \\"Disarm.\\" While both great songs (well, at least the former), they are easily outshined by several other tracks. I'd have to say \\"Mayonnaise\\" (Track 9) is by far the best Smashing Pumpkins song ever released; if you're looking for one track to download to sample the album before buying, make sure this is it. \\"Hummer\\" is not far behind; that section between about 4:30 and 5:30 (\\"Ask yourself a question...\\") somehow sends chills down my spine every time. Other five-star tracks include \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Quiet,\\" \\"Soma\\" and \\"Luna.\\"<br />All in all, this is the high point of the Pumpkins' career, as it manages to expand greatly upon GISH but avoid the tedious experimental sounds found from this point on. The five-star average ought to say something; even classic records like AENIMA cannot pull this off. The bottom line is that this, one of the best rock releases of all time, defined the alt-rock sound of the 1990's and performed it better than any of the copycats, and manages to be both accessible and deep. Don't hesitate to pick up a copy if you're a fan of any type of rock music.
B003F3NE1Q|2|Love the series but my last disc came in so scratched that I can't watch 2 of the episodes without it skipping like crazy.
B0015DROBO|3|Honestly the first half of the book is VERY confusing!  Lots of characters with odd/foreign names to remember.  There is even a family tree in the beginning of the book because it's so crazy.  After about half way...book got GREAT!
B00000272N|5|When I can listen to an entire album from start to finish and be well satisfied with it, that is a clear 5 star rating.  Over 20 years after recording, this cd is still fresh.  This is one of the stronger debuts from a well known band.  It is sad that they couldn't put out more recordings with the original vocalist in the 1990's.
B00AIUUXHC|5|This game is awesome . If you want to have the best game ever on your device get this game
B00000K19E|5|This is the best movie by far I have ever seen. To all of you who said that it was a crummy movie go take a red pill and wake up!
B004EPYZPS|2|I just viewed this on amazon Prime before deciding if I wanted to purchase the Blu-Ray or not.  There is a solid reason why I hate JJ Abrams, and this proves no different.  Plausible and predictable story line, trying to be \\"edgy\\" in photography when all you really get is a headache and just poor direction.  You would think being he destroyed the STAR TREK franchise, he could at least do some homage to his own written movie...apparently not. Do not waist money purchasing this, if you REALLY want to see it, and yu are a Amazon Prime member view it for free and save yourself the embarrassment of ordering.
B00HHJOH2Y|5|It was funny & heart warming.  A definite must see for anyone who watched the first movie.  You will thank me later.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|I just got it Monday, and have listened to it multiple times.  I LOVE it!  Beautiful singing.
0316789798|5|Arrived quickly.  Enjoyable and informative as to how to draw animals in a &#34;cartoonish way&#34;.
B0000CEB4V|3|To me this was a surreal George Harrison concert. everything about it just showed George more than it showed any of the miscians up there. I loved it! I wondered why Eric didn't perform &quot;Badge&quot;,a song that George wrote for him. And not ALL if his friends were there. What about BOB DYLAN??? He was close to George. And it seems 2 me the only Python the George wasnt close 2 was John Cleese. Whats the story there? What does Tom Hanks have 2 do with them. But all in all in was a VERY moving, spiritual and emotional concert.They say George always wanted 2 have a concert like that. Its a shame it happened after his passing. At least there was the 1971 Bangla Desh concert (which I hope they'll release on DVD) But anyrate great concert but minus 2 stars for Bob Dylan and John Cleese.
B00DJFIMW6|2|I got this for my grandson to play while we are traveling.  It looks like a cute game, however, he kept trying to get added features & was spending far too much money.  So I deleted it.  I like games that he can play for free without the need to purchase added features just to play.
B00IXF8PLU|5|Rented this on a &#34;home sick day&#34; and truly liked this movie. Very engaging and thought provoking. A movie without any bad words or sex scenes - imagine that. I'd recommend it.
B00C8S9VKM|4|I liked everything about the book & I would recommend it to everybody. It was good for some people n
B00127RAJY|5|Love Jillian Michaels!  Her workout videos have yet to disappoint me.  I felt great after finishing the 30-day shred.  It really works!!
B005IQ39AY|4|Game is fun to pass the time. There is no colorblind mode, which does become an issue at times. But if you like this type of game, it's worth it.
B0070DQZ86|3|The extended cut added a bunch more stuff about the witch.  I preferred the original.
B002MQYOFW|5|Love it read it it's TOTALY completely amazing im kind of too lazy to write a real review :) YOLO
B005KAH7QU|5|Really liked this one. Great action. Nice twists.
B004MC8CA2|5|This is the greatest thing on my phone! Allows me to take my Bible anywhere I go. It has an option to read it to me, there are notes from my church weekly service to follow &amp; email to myself when I am done. Has quick search to find any scripture I am looking for. It has all kinds of reading plans to follow. Makes Bible Reading easy!
B003JUGQ38|5|Just... fantastic.  Great incorporation of characters from the 9th and 10th Doctors.  Companians, family, Time Agents, Torchwood.... Daleks... all make an appearance.  Great wrap up of the Donna season.
B003UBTX6S|4|Beautiful Darkness opens the world of Gatlin, Casters, and Mortals; good and bad and spills it all out in a great read. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B002PNKXLG|5|An excellent Classic.
0800141660|5|The is one of my favorite movies of all time. The characters are as amazing as the story. I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it. I highly recommend it.
B00OICLVBI|5|Great book, every couple should read it to understand their spouse.
B004DLPXAO|5|I love this app and I really love the kindle store.. There is always plenty of books to pick from.. daily deals, great prices, and lots of free books to enjoy.. My favorite part of my tablet by far..
B00HHC33YY|3|I love Dolly and I have most of her music, but this one just doesn't do it for me.  Never fear I still admire her.
B00ESB6GBY|1|I watched this show for nine years only to find out that the writers could care less about consistent characterization and the entire last season is a waste of time.<br /><br />If you must watch it, watch the first three seasons and pretend it ends there.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Learning the tricks of the game on each level is challenging and entertaining.  I love the colors but leave out the noise!
B00AIUUXHC|1|I tried to play it the second I got it I tried to play but the load screen was still on I literally sat there waiting for 45 minutes
B0007TKNIS|5|Wonderful, there should be so much true love in the world. Enspiring and full of hope that someone is out there for everyone. I think it is the most wonderful movie of all time!!!
B004DLPXAO|5|I love my kindle.  My husband is in a nursing home but still very capable .  I am thinking about getting him a kindle.  I have even downloaded the kindle app to my phone.
B00HMJTBU2|4|Great movie
B000JMKNJ2|5|Who doesn't love a good con? It's a rich setting with unique and entertaining characters, a rapidly developing plot, and enough action to bury the hook in you real good.
B0071XO8RA|3|An intriguing yarn but not enough of the back story - how it all got started and who designed the silos? None the less an interesting page turner.
B005NAE04E|5|Loved the book so much I've bought russian language copy for my husband.  )<br />You read it and you smile. It is nicer and less adult then Stardust (the book)
B001IF5YLQ|1|This was not a mini display port adaptor!<br /><br />This was an adaptor for thunderbolt port!<br /><br />Not sure how and why someone would be able to sell something that's not labeled what it is, right here on Amazon...<br /><br />Anyway... Part is not mini display port.  Epic failure.  Skewed with a live presentation I needed to do, and now I can't afford finding another adaptor for this solution...
B007N85POS|5|once again it is a game that the grand boys love.  gramma always has a new game is what they say  I enjoy it with them
1932100660|5|Valuable reference to intelligent eating.
B0053TMP24|5|This is an all fun interrogating book series for kids (and adults) of all ages!<br />Fun to read by yourself for the older people or have someone a bit bigger read to you if your still not really knowing what those words mean. This series is spectacular! And I advise you to get it.
B0002IU988|4|I am not a passonate music fan. I don't listen to just one thing.  Somedays I will play Mozart in the car and other days I will rock out to Country. I was a very unlikely fan of Creed.  I reluctantly went to a CREED show with some friends and was moved by the adoration of their fans.  I then bought the CD and loved it.  Then they broke up.  Nothing since Creed gave me the chills until AlterBridge.  At first I wasn't that crazy about the singer on the cd because I was expecting the low baratone sound of Creed, until I saw them live.  WOW!  I have a real appreciation for the band.  I especially love the bass lines.  The cd is great but a live show is AWESOME!
B002Z0TPFE|1|Horrible video quality. Would have enjoyed to watch this film, but it was so blurry.
0070511136|2|I can see where this book might make supplemental reading, but it is so obvious that the author and his subjects are not real sales people. <br /> <br />The most useful part of this book was the section on implication questions. The problem is it leaves you with some decent questions to ask, but, now what the heck am I am supposed to do? <br /> <br />And the concept is not new. Zig Ziglar has been teaching the same process along with his top trainer, Brian Flanigan. Ziglar calls it POGO and you can read about it in Zigler on Selling. You will also find more useful information th an what is available here. Perhaps that is because Ziglar and Flanigan are real salesmen and have taught hundreds of thousands of successful salespeople techniques that work now for over 40 years. <br /> <br />Perhaps Rackam took a Zig Ziglar seminar or bought his book and is trying to pass his ideas as being original. <br /> <br />If you want to see this book, go to your local library where you can borrow it for free or buy it for $2.50 or less at a used bookstore.
B0095ZMMCK|5|Definitely worth the money. I wish Clancy would write more. Bear & the Dragon is probably his best thought still.
B0064TVQ5E|4|Overall this app greatly exceded expectations as far as content and user friendlyness.<br /><br />Cons: Ads, ocassional freezing/glitchyness<br /><br />Give it a try, the price is right
B0037RDPEG|2|This book was really slow in parts especially in the middle - and kind of boring. It was not what I expected. It did get better towards the end.
B00DR0PDNE|3|Does bot work with my computer.  Sound & picture broken up and jerky
B00I2TV3NO|5|Great sequel to the first Hunger Games movie; action-packed and good on its own- but so much better having the back story to follow the characters motivation throughout the series. Nice to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman in one of his last roles....
B001FB4W16|3|Coming from the creator of one of the most enjoyable TV shows (Six Feet Under), I had high expectations for this show. Perhaps unrealistically high.  This show that is basically set inside a secluded bar while critiquing the relationships within a small town seems remarkably similar to a certain show created by David Lynch. However, it doesn't possess any of the suspense or darkness that Twin Peaks had.    If I had to summarize my experience of the 1st season without spoilers I would say this:    1. Enough with the forced Southern accents. They are inaccurate and grating.  2. Too easy to see the comparisons between gay rights and vampire rights. I expect more subtlety for HBO productions.  3. Plot seems to rotate between sex and sucking blood. Could have benefitted from more suspense and mystery.      That said, I'll begrudgingly watch Season 2 to see if it improves.
B00DOPEGAS|5|A Christmas gift that was well enjoyed!
B00BQ4NLC8|1|The book is shallow at best. Given the reviews, I expected a much better book. Turns out that this is not an interesting book. The plot is unrealistic. Waste of money and time.
B00J8CGU64|5|Great Rags to Riches stor with a twist
B0027MJU00|3|good book
B00KFWEWZ2|1|I couldnt even get through the first episode.  I kept thinking 'Where is she going with this? What is she talking about?' and finally 'When is she going to shut up?'
0374530718|4|It is a creative way to introduce philiosophic concepts to high schoolers. A number of important philsophers are not discussed at all or very cursorily. No mention at all is made of Roman philosophy, nothing is mentioned about John Dewey's philosophy and nothing about the pragmatic views of William James. Much more could have and should have been done with Francis Bacon. But, much is accomplished in only a few hundred pages. A worthy effort
B00005JLT5|3|dvd is a bit faulty...freezes frequently...skips....not enough aggrevation to return it but know I'll never attempt to watch it again. very disappointing
013168728X|5|This is a very good book on Image Processing that gives a lot of examples as it explains a new concept. Highly recommended if you are going to learn image processing from scratch or just want to use it as a reference. However, I do NOT recommend the other version of this book that deals with MATLAB.
B008IJTFYW|5|The best relaxation app period!!! It's highly customizable and the sounds are superior to all the other apps I have. It plays great on both my Big Jam Bluetooth and  Kindle Fire. This app is rich of realistic sounds that play all the seasons with soft instruments as an accompaniment.
0345535529|5|George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones is a wonderful series but even better to tread the books!!!
B00OX3F1JK|5|Interesting and imaginative concept is packaged in a story that moves well and has memorable characters.  You will need to open your imagination backwards toward believing that civilizations could have existed before the Garden of Eden in order to root for the protagonist. Could God have done all this creation thing before, and started over with us? Looking forward to the next book!
B008CLI4N4|5|Love it
B00004T8RK|3|I just got the new cd and I'm betting thier be a lot of reveiws with words like mature ,growing, evolving, which is what this cd is I like it its has an intensity that is subtle but grabs you . The biggest problem is that i'm  a pearl jam fan and this isn't what I paid my money for I want those  catchey songs that you can't get out of your had and make you think that  music just never gets this good . if you already have the other pearl jam  cd's buy this its worth it just for the single but if you don't have any  buy vs,ten hell even vitalogy because thats what your really looking for.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5|I became a fan of Bruno Mars way later than most people. I always liked his voice but never got too into him, until after I heard him perform \\"Valerie\\" on MTV as a tribute to Amy Winehouse, after that I was hooked. So I purchased the album and also his EP, and I can't get enough of him! He is clearly super talented not only in song writing but his voice is mesmerizing and a TRUE talent. You can listen to the live recordings, or even go to youtube and search for him in concert, and his voice is just as amazing live as on the album, which is rare now days. He has said himself that his lyrics are simple ans to the point, and he is right which is why I love him even more. Some songs are obviously superior to others, but all in all I greatly enjoy each song on the album, there isn't one that I don't listen to.<br />I believe \\"Talking To The Moon\\" should have been released as a single, because it is a wonderful song and his voice is beautiful. I feel like you can feel his emotion through his voice in each song. His voice has even made me enjoy the rap songs he is featured in, when I usually hate rap! I can't wait for his next album, I feel like it will be even better.
B009UX2YAC|5|diz game is awesome theres no freezing or stopping and its wayyy better than temple run. i really think u should buy this game because its FFA.(Free Fun Addictive)
B00CBRAD2A|3|Standard shoot em up fare with a lot of action and an unusually resourceful bad guy.
B001706I5I|5|Great movie<br />Jim Carey  Nailed it!!😊😊
1563523302|3|This book is interesting in that it points out that most truly weathy people are those that saved their money.  But to what purpose?  They seem to promote saving money only to give it to follow on generations.  What a  waste of life!  The best example of this was one millionaire they talked to  who said that he wanted his children to &quot;have a better life.&quot;   Presumably they will if they do with his money what he did not do: spend  it.
0802798225|5|wow, i can't believe its taken me this long to write a review. i read perfect chemistry along with the other 2 books to the sequel rules of attraction, and chain reaction. this book was such a relatable book written from 2 perspectives, a gang member, loving, caring, and sexy mexican boy alejandro and a perfect, caring, smart white not at all as it seems Brittany. this book shows the truth about stereotypes and the importance of reputations. its realistic and takes place in the suburbs on the outskirts of chicago. this book is so amazing and is easy to relate to weather your mexican, white, a gang banger, rich, live on the south, or north, have a handicapped sister, or not. and if you've never been in love or no what it is this book will show you. romantic, funny, INTRESTING and to be honest it was the first and last book to make me cry. THIS BOOK IS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. just because its a romance doesn't mean a boy won't love it! we had to do book clubs in my class and didn't want to read another crappy school book so i suggested this to the group  because i knew they would love it! sure enough the other 2 girls AND GUY loved it! of course they're reading the other 2 asap! BEST BOOK IVE EVER READ. its in all cps libraries if you care to check it out and also at barnes and noble. i guarantee you'll fall in love.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved this book!  It was a very easy, quick read.  Captivating and left me wanting to know more about their story.
141971189X|5|It cam in great condition, look forward to giving for Christmas
B00L9B7IKE|3|Enjoyable reading.
B0094BB4TW|1|Still can't get this to work on kindle fire hd. If I could give it zero stars I would.
B00003CXCQ|1|This is a suspected pirate copy, as with the Little Mermaid also sold by Fuji of Japan. Beware!
B0011Z33ES|5|Josh Groban is probably the best male vocalist at this time
B00004XOWM|1|The sooner we quit comparing how great every other nu-metal/rap-metal band is in comparison to Limp Bizkit, the quicker these bozos (LB) will disappear from sight.
B006WSKTPU|5|Great show
B00845PRDS|5|A real world story with real world operators as actors.  Perhaps no Academy Awards except for realism.  Go SEALS!
B00EV1YZ96|5|The little ones love this movie! Fast delivery packaged well
B000YDIA00|5|Timberlands never disappoint!
B000OZ0NXA|4|Like his style of writing…a bit too descriptive when he describes &#34;murders&#34;.  Don't need as much gore as he includes.
B00A8ECU24|5|This app is so cool! I love the equestria girls dancing game you can win free ponies that are too expensive to buy in the store! And don't forget the balloon pop game! You can win coins and elements of harmony! You can play fun mini games to get your ponies stars! And if you click on the ponies they talk! I so recommend this app to anyone who loves my little pony. Have fun playing!!!
B00QW8TYWO|4|When you have some spare time this game is great. The game is very fun earning coins to unlock new pets to play with. Good Game all round. :)
140006922X|5|It was impressive, though I must say I am pretty sure there is more strength in the position of Jesus as a man of peace whose actions were expressions of shalom.  Aslan is a great story teller.  Amazing.
B005ERIRZE|5|I've read everything I can find about procrastination, self-discipline and changing an unwanted habit, including The Power of Habits by Duhigg.  Duhigg's book is better than most, but I give it C+ for how helpful it was to me.  I didn't think I'd find anything new on the topic, but Willpower Instinct is a cutting-edge research-based book and a real eye-opener.  What's more, it is actually practical and very, very helpful.  It goes far beyond the usual (which is make lists, prioritize, reward small steps, figure out what is motivating your unwanted behavior and find a more desirable way to meet that need - all of which one needs willpower to do).  I've sent Willpower Instinct to my sister and she loved it also. I wish I could take the author's course.
B00I2X7X7K|4|A deeply moving world war II story of a young orphan girl and her interactions with her adoptive parents, school mates and town's people.
B00IH2N8N4|5|Excellent action movie. I watched this one,more than once.<br />Great movie for your colection.
B00E8KLWB4|5|this is a fun game to pop into and stay challenged. I enjoy the different puzzles so there is always something different to do.
B00DA9PX0A|4|The story really kept me going and I literally couldn't put it down. It was exactly what I needed to get out of my book rut. I definitely liked that there was decent character development. How I felt that the book kind of just stopped, I mean there was a resolution but not complete resolution. I felt like there were still some thing that needed to be cleared up . I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to read a good contemporary.
B004DF3S7A|5|I just love Rod Stewart singing anything. The best of Great American Song book I love the way he fits is alluring style to the oldies of the 40', 50's and 60's. He has his way around a song and this can't be denied. He somehow puts his own unique stamp on each and every song he sings.
B00MWZIB6Q|5|Great product

0440211727|4|In this debut novel from today's most prolific author of legal thrillers, a black Viet Nam vet kills the men who raped his daughter in a small Mississippi town. Throw in an ambitious young defense lawyer, the KKK and the NAACP, and this action-packed story takes the reader on a suspense-filled journey. The topic of justified murder makes for a captivating read.
B0000C8AVR|5|\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" may not be as consistently catchy as \\"Blonde On Blonde\\", but it's still one of the best albums ever recorded. With its first single, \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", Dylan was launched into stardom as the world's greatest singer/songwriter. This album essentially made folk-rock a credible subgenre as most people turned their heads to Dylan at the time (they were used to the slow and more delicate folk albums by the likes of The Kingston Trio, for instance). Though not every song here is as catchy as this hit, they're all great songs with incredible lyrics (that's the main reason to buy a Dylan album, anyway). This is another extremely quotable and deep album by the master himself. If all you've been listening to your whole life is MTV bands, do yourself a favor and by this album to have your life renewed! Absolutely recommended!    Highlights include:  the entire album!
B00C2VIA52|4|To hard to get cards gets to hard to fast but still an ok game cards look good still trying to figure it all out
B00CATSONE|4|This book is a crash course on the life of Nikola Tesla, but only focusing on the facts and his creations. It gives a peek into how money can squash genius, and kind of made me hate Edison. After the walkthrough of Tesla's life, the author wraps it up with the concept that imagination is a more important trait than intelligence or wealth. I had no idea of the plethora of advanced concepts that Tesla dreamed up - from DC power to the Internet, eclectic cars to most likely the first contact with extraterrestrial life. Yet, he was practically ignored in history books. I'd like to get more into the psyche of the man, and will be looking for other books to get to know him better.
B005RJ6AIK|4|It really puts you in the mood for Hawaii.  Island music at its best.  Has a calming effect and is relaxing.
0984725113|5|I heard Andrew McAfee speak and was intrigued by the book.  I was fascinating and a surprisingly fast read.
B000E33W1W|4|A childhood of my generation would not be complete without the story of \\"Ghostbusters\\".  This is fun madcap adventures dabbling into the mocked up world of the occult. Here are the classic lines and scenes in all their glory.  It's a comedic blast that just has to be kept around.
B00DURILJ2|5|This was an excellent movie; one of the best I've seen.  The acting is superb.  I highly recommend this exciting, colorful movie.

B00DPM7TIG|5|I liked this book very much.  It gave an insight to the war we lived through from the other side.
B00992CF6W|5|Minecraft pocket edition is awesome when the 0.9.0 update is alpha it will be just like the pc  the only difference is redstone but when they added minecrafter I realized how fast it has gone along from almost nothing to this it is such a great game and I give it 5 stars good job mojang
B00DJFIMW6|4|I love Minion Rush. It is so much fun. It is like Temple Run and Subway Suffers combined; but better than both apps. It is addicting and challenging. Be careful; there are in-game purchases using real money. This app does glitch a lot; force closes; and froze up my Kindle Fire twice. Once; I couldn't shut it down. I had to contact Amazon to get help. The other time; I could shut it down. Because of these problems; even though it is a great app; download at your own risk.
B000006NPY|5|Billy Corgan had the daunting task to follow up his much hailed double set &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; that was seemingly so big it would take something even bigger to beat it. Thankfully Mr. Corgan and the Pumpkins decided to put the past behind them and give the world this delightfully low key outing that stands out in its non-Mellon Collie-ness. With the release of drummer-supreme Jimmy Chamberlain due to drug problems, Billy decided to shy away from that sound and instead add keyboard and synths sounds to creat a different Pumpkins album. The songs are smooth and sad, echoing Billy's life with the end of his marriage and the passing of his mother. While a commercial &quot;dissapointment&quot; (only when compared to its previous siblings) Adore is no less sonically stimulating. Especially since it is so different.
B007J4T2G8|5|I have read this book many, many times. Yes the sex is hot, hot, hot, but I love the storyline even better!!! Christian Grey is a great character he is loyal, giving, and very loving - yet he doesn't see himself that way at all. He was abused through the relationship with his birth mother so he can't see any good in himself at all. Which makes you want to root for him all the more! He loves Ana with everything inside of him yet all he sees is that he doesn't want to lose her not the why behind it. Ana is Christian's saving grace and Christian is Ana's other half. Do you need to know anything else to make you want to read this... I don't think so!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|1|Lousy game, big rip off.
B0058UXHHK|5|A fun, easy read with just enough mystery to keep it interesting without being predictable.  I especially appreciated not being subjected to graphic violence or sex scenes.
B004FGMDOQ|5|This book was a great read. My 16 yr old daughter is reading it now. She can't put it down.

B00006CXSS|5|Absolutely riveting story packaged to binge-watch.  Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks spent a fortune producing a TV series that must have been agonizing to watch as originally presented by HBO.  One had to wait for days or weeks for the next episode.  Because each episode was so well produced and performed.  The producers focused on one main character for each story and also chose different directors for many episodes.  As an ex-medic and hospital corpsman who treated lots of wounded soldiers including horribly torn up Marines right off the battlefields of Vietnam, the corpsman's story episode was especially moving because here a real soldier is not treating strangers but his buddies ... his comrades in arms.  As individual stories and as a complete saga, this film is a masterpiece that far outshines the Stephen Ambrose book from which it was adapted.  And its all here ... including interviews with the real soldiers of the 506th Airborne Regiment, the actors who portrayed them and the famous producers, Hanks and Spielberg.  I have never recommended anything on amazon with such confidence.
B004TI5N38|4|A \\"Reacher\\"-like character, but with an intriguing family overlay.  The story line mixes a complex web of characters with some our hidden history.
B003YL4LYI|5|Excellent, a vast improvement from book 4. The story progresses some from the last book but primarily discusses the back story of characters excluded from book 4. Highly recommend to any fan of the series.
B008UFUOH6|5|This is just exceptional. Whether she's doing her own songs or the old standards, she's top shelf. This quickly became one of my all time favorite Christmas albums.
B00E3IZIM0|5|I really love this movie, but then again, I was raised in the transformers / Godzilla culture of the late 70's / 80's, so go figure. The amount of attention to detail is really stunning, and I really like that Del Toro tried to do as much of the filming NON-CGI as possible.  It does translate better into the big screen and just looks less &#34;fake&#34;.  The acting is decent, although I feel the person that really steals the show and adds a lot of emotional &#34;oomph&#34; to the story is the actress who plays young Mako.  She's got that scared and wide eyed stare of wonder thing down pat.  The one thing I noticed (while in the theater watching the film) was that I wish the composer would vary some of the thematic music (especially every time you see a jaeger pop onto the screen).<br /><br />The blu-ray extras are a nice look into the making of the film.  This film apparently did better overseas than here in the states, and there has already been some talk about a sequel...
B006S043TA|5|Funny
B00284BMBM|5|Another great Daughtry album!!  This album does not disappoint.  If you like this album you should definitely check out [[ASIN:B002CPD5M6 Heavy Crown]] by the Lovehammers.  Two great albums that I can't stop listening to!
B00G3HSF7O|2|I really wanted to like this film being a fan of Matt Damon but the premise is just ridiculous. I mean do you really expect us to believe that the billions on Earth are incapable of producing science and technology to compete with a few thousand &#34;elites&#34; on a space station?
B00APAENUI|3|Although this book was a logical extension of the series, I found part of it somewhat difficult to get through.
B00008H2LB|2|This band just comes in here thinkin their the best band in the world and think that they can reach up to Metallica or Nirvana or even Pantera. Next thing you know they might think there sellin 4,000,000 copies a day on 1 album.... yeah right....<br />     If you wont real music get these:Metallica, Nirvana,Pantera,System of a Down,Alice in Chains, or KoRn.<BR>             get them and you Will thank me you are not listening to this whiny little screaming nerd band.The only rap/rock band I even listen to is the old style limpbizkit like Significant Other or 3 doller bill.
B001BANK32|4|A lot better than the movie. I wish the movie focused on Dick Hallorann's perspective a lot more like it does is the book. A good read that added some scare to me.
B004EFYZ1C|4|This app is fun and cool!  My husband thought it was cool too.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys following the phases of the moon. This app was configured well.

B006MW3V6U|5|I was always one that would be turning the channel when actors came out with accents however this moves right along and is very entertaining.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Wonderful book! Great story with interesting points of view. Very well written. The storyline in addition to the layout of the chapters makes it impossible to put down!
B00BAYLQI0|5|Wow, how more realistic can it get?  Did you feel you were actually there in the 1996 movie &#34;Twister?&#34;  This flick kind of puts effects into the 2015 era.  I have watched this on a Showtime free (I Hope) promo twice and keep missing the beginning.  But on my 2nd attempt, I caught it just before the Tsunami hit the pool at the resort. This is a very remarkable, heart moving movie.  It tears you up but gives so much hope. A little more attention to the locals would have made it greater.

B00275EHJG|5|Getting too old to play with toys is something that everyone has to go through. Toy Story 3 is an excellent example of a movie that views this situation in a way that makes the viewer sympathize with both the toys and their now older kid owner who is off to college. In the opening scene, Buzz and Woody, two toys, wake up in an old toy box many years later than when viewers had last seen them. After giving a wide scan of the room, the cruel truth of the fate of being a toy kicks in. We soon find out that over the years the other toys had been given away, and the characters' feelings about it are learned. I found that this movie is both relatable and has many great themes that are addressed today in society.   Later within the same scene, their owner Andy finishes up packing for college and has to make the hard decision of whom he is going to take with him. Of course all of the toys want to go, but they also want to stay together and not have to get split up. Andy ends up choosing Woody, since he is more sentimentally attached to him than the other toys.  Although Woody is happy that he was the chosen toy, he still does not want to split up from his friends. Later, Andy puts all of the other toys in a trash bag to store in the attic, but his mom mistakens it for things that he wants to throw away. After a heroic scene of escaping from the horrific trash truck's clutches, the toys feel that they are not wanted anymore. They make the brave decision of donating themselves to a Sunnyside Daycare, but Woody finds them and tries to get them to stay. He accidentally ends up going with them to the daycare. When they arrive, they are welcomed by many toys and Lots-O-Huggin' Bear, who is in charge of them all. The Andy's toys all get assigned to the Caterpillar Room, and Woody finally gives up trying to convince them and goes home.   Not long after Woody leaves, the toys get a taste for what they are in for. They learn the hard way that the kids in the Caterpillar Room are waytoo young to be playing with toys and greatly mistreat them. That night, Buzz escapes the room to plead with the other toys to change their room. Lots-O-Huggin' Bear claims that all new toys go there first, and he soon gets mad. He figures out that Lots-O and some of the other toys at the daycare are bad. They switch Buzz's setting, so he starts talking in Spanish. Meanwhile, when Woody had been walking home, a girl form the daycare had picked him up and taken him home with her. He meets other toys at her house. One of which had had the same owner as Lots-O-Huggin' Bear and reveals the story of why he is now so evil.   Lots-O begins to let Andy's toys view his real side, and he locks all of them up. He has them all under heavy surveillance. By morning, Woody has returned to help out his friends. He had realized that they were in danger when the toys from the girl's house had told him about Lots-O. From here on, the toys have to work together to achieve their goal of escaping the daycare and getting back home, where they belong.   What I loved about this movie was how relatable it is to both children and adults. Almost every person, at some point in their life, thought that toys were real and came to life when we were not there.  Toy Story 3 captures this perfect in not just this last installment, but both of the previous movies also, in a way that most would have envisioned it. Another aspect if the movie that I at first found interesting that they would put in a children's movie, was that everyone gets too old for toys. When I had heard that that was going to be in the movie, I had thought that this topic would somewhat upset kids because they love their toys so much now. However while watching the movie, I realized that I had been wrong by assuming that. It was used very well in the plot, to the point that it was appreciated by the adults and children watching. At some points it had me in tears, but I mostly believe that this was because I knew that I had alreadygone through what was addressed in the movie. This leads me to my next point, which is about having to give toys away, another sensitive topic for children. Again, this was used at a perfect angle to show that it is something that has to be done, but it will turn out okay.   Another great feature of this movie is that it has many great themes that are addressed today in society. This film addressed bullying, which is the same whether it is with people or toys. Exclusion is another topic that is dealt with. No one likes to feel left out and not as special as others. In the movie, Lots-O and the other older toys at the daycare got more privileges and could do what ever they wanted. They pretty much ran the place. I do not think that it is much different that what teenagers and kids do to each other in real life. This movie really proves to its viewers that they can get through similar situations.   All in all, this was a good movie, that was not like the tasteless animated sequels sometimes seen in kids movies. I actually liked this movie better than the ones that came before it. Toy Story 3 was not only made for the obvious child audience but also for the parent audience as well. Who enjoyed it more? I honestly believe the parents.
B00AREIAI8|5|I love it u can feed the horse brush treat muck out paddock cleanout train her or him its spool cool u should get it!!!!!!!!!!
B00133KFGW|5|YES THIS HAS ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED and is a GREAT movie.  GREAT story. i grew up with a young man from an orphanage he was always smiling and laughing but you could see the far away look in his eyes.  i really could see him in this story.<br />Thank you for AUGUST RUSH.
0375414053|5|Another gem from an NPR interview!  I laughed and wept my way through this book!  It reminded me of my young years as  working mum, and showed the esential absurdity of modern life.  Kate's besetting sin is that she is an intelligent, highly competent and attractive woman and she is a better provider, financially, emotionally and practically than her husband.  Will this marriage survive?  Especially given the temptations put in Kate's way.  The tensions between the working mum and the stay-at-home mums are well drawn, and that mother-in-law!  What a character!  Originally I bought this for my daughter-in-law, but now I am not so sure I want her to read it-- yet!
B00005K3OT|5|Interesting romantic film dealing with unsavory aspects of human nature while maintaining a positive feel - a rare thing that!  This is a \\"feel good\\" movie that I would recomment highly.  So highly that this was purchased as a gift!
B0025UHKNS|1|If you buy this product be prepared for some trouble. I have had mine back to Garmin 3 times - once for backlight going out and 2 for the product going dead and would not charge. This is a recurring problem with this product and Garmin has not addressed it yet. They tend to want to blame the customer for not charging correctly etc. After receiving my 3rd refurbished item, the item now will just change screens at random---I will be on a training run and look down and it shows satellites etc. This product is not a reliable performer. To their credit Garmin did replace my unit 3 times but always with a refurbished product. For the money - get something more reliable.
B00C4YZ12C|5|Just an all-around fun game, and VERY well done. If you like classic arcade games (Galaga, Defender, and the like) then just get this game and enjoy it!
B006AX6ONI|5|The whole book confirms the known fact - anyone is able to achieve success with the idea he's passionate about. The passion about your idea, the vision of the product developed from that idea are the key factors in building the successful start-up. Simply written, easy to read and very inspiring.
B006LSZECO|2|Horrible ending!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Good mystery. Hard to put down.
B007PT3QOQ|5|awesome. just wish there wasnt special currency for cool things... but its a lot of fun none the less. the graphics are cute. i wish energy didnt take so damn long to show up too. fix that and the game will be perfect.
B00A2LFXVI|5|Couldn't stop watching this one. Watching the Joker going postal at the amusement park almost seemed surreal with all the shootings we see today. I read this comic a long time ago and it is one of the best. The move doesn't dissapoint. Check it out and you'll know what I'm saying.
B0036S4B6M|5|Loved it! Kerman gives a heart felt account of her experiences in prison. Great read despite heavy tones of white privilege.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I am really enjoying this game. I'm really trying not to look at the hints, and even so the hints don't give much away. Not as challenging as Myst, but I'm kind of glad. Myst was too frustrating and boring.
B000002UAO|5|Not one dull track on this whole album.  George Harrison shines with \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and \\"Think for Yourself\\", which has a great fuzz bass line.  Every song is a classic
B005MYEQ4U|5|This is a movie you will want to watch over again several times.  The character were brought into play in a most interesting and refreshing way.  It inspired me to pull some novels down off of the shelf and re-explore some classics.  A great movie to showcase talents and bring past great authors and their works to life!
B00R2Z32PQ|5|Awesome movie. Great special effects. cool storyline Id definately watch it again !!! :)
B004YKB52O|5|This is definitely one of my favorite albums of 2011. The album is fun and energetic. But there are still some slower songs such as \\"Gone Too Soon\\" and \\"Astronaut.\\" I'll be honest and say I hadn't listened to Simple Plan in years, but this album made me fall in love with their music all over again. Get Your Heart On! is full of great collaborations including Alex Gaskarth from All Time Low, Rivers Cuomo, Natasha Bedingfield, and K'naan.   One of my favorite things about Simple Plan is how much they care about their fans. Once again, they show how much their fans mean to them with the song \\"This Song Saved My Life.\\" Not only was the song written with the help form the fans through Twitter, but the band even had fans come into the studio and sing on the track.   Although I do love their other records, I believe Get Your Heart On! is Simple Plan's best record yet. It was definitely worth every cent and I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Easy to setup, lots of apss supported, easy to use. recommended
B005D9MUWY|5|overall very impressed with this application.  It knows what you want to say.  takes texting to a whole new level. This is my first time reviewing an application.  I typically don't spend the time but this one really caught my attention.
B006GLLXXK|5|Very interesting show!
B0028MBKVG|5|What an amazing story.  I read this while on vacation in Belize.  I couldn't put it down.  Anyone that is a runner or can appreciate the benefits of running should read this.  I have read it 3 times now.  The great thing is that I read a lot of other books about running and runners and a lot of them either refer to this book, or some of the the people within the story.  This should be on every runners shelf.  I also bought the Kindle version so I can read parts over again on the train to work.  It is always an inspiration and sometimes I need a little extra push when the weather get's a bit nasty or life just gets real busy.  I truly is a great read!
B00J2VSS0C|4|This game is good
B007SOQBCM|1|I try to get it but it said that unable to install. :( and I want to do livestreams. :(
B00D8CSVLW|5|Another great story with twists and turns that keep the reader absorbed. The characters are well developed and vivid. Great movie material!
031606792X|5|First let me say, I can't believe how much this book is hated. I was completely unspoiled before I read this, but I had heard people hated and wanted to return the book. I absolutly loved it. There were so many things I didn't see coming. I don't like spoiling anything so I will try to make this spoilerless.<br />The story takes place as Edward and Bella are getting ready to marry. They go on there honeymoon and comeback to Forks with something extra. Something that is going to kill Bella.<br />I love the new character, Renessme. I kinda hope Meyer writes a book about her someday. I can't pinpoint what I really loved about this book, but the more I think about it, the more I think the writing was good and the mystery within the story better. I wish there was more of the series to read.
B007THA4FI|5|I know some people may be taken aback at the content of this book. As usual J.K. Rowling writes a beautiful story woven with many characters. This is not a kids book. This is a book that could easily be someone's reality. No character is sainted. Everyone is flawed. It was thought provoking and sad. I loved every bit of it.
B00PSLQGX6|5|Superb - sophisticated
B00E9A656K|4|I think they could make it better but Is a nice game... a little bit expensive if you want to get something nice but good.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I like this game. I just wish some of them made more sense. I stayed ono one for a while and the clues made no sense
B0001NBMBC|5|Awesome CD. Really enjoy it.  I think I had this CD at one time, but misplaced it.  I am glad I got this again
B0015AARJI|4|There very few controllers with this quality. I just replaced my previous one because it broke and I hope this one last a long time.
B00FRQ32N4|4|I love this game but since the update it has been confusing and the mystery draw is messed up I pressed on one of the cards but it did not pick it so I picked the one next to it the card that I clicked was Zeus but I got a measly 500 dollars instead total waste of points but good game overall
B001PE26QQ|3|OK, I was originally going to give this a much lower star rating, but didn't want people to mistaken it as a negative review of the film itself, because it isn't, the film is a GREAT martial arts film. My low rating is the DVD itself. First thing I noticed is that the subtitles neglected to subtitle the words in the beginning credits. Now I'm not talking about the names, I'm talking about the first paragraph after the names right after you see him practicing Wing Chun, which tells the audience about the city and how it's known for being the origin of China's Nan Tian style of martial arts. And for that reason, it attracts martial artists from all over China to establish dojos and to exchange martial arts culture. It goes on to say that today Fuoshan (the town in the film where Ip Man is from) have become known as \\"THE TOWN\\" of martial arts. If you can't read Chinese, you won't know what that entire paragraph reads, and that's stupid because it's kind of important to the story.    The second thing I noticed is how poor the quality was. It's not so bad that it's unwatchable, but it's FAR worse than most DVD's I've owned.    Then the thing that made me stop watching this was the audio. For some reason they decided they didn't like the original audio stream and replaced it. But the first thing you'll notice is the volume. It's EXTREMELY low, you'll have to crank your system all the way up if you are to hear anything.    Then the next thing you'll notice is the bad syncing of the lips and of the fighting sound effects. The reason for this isn't apparent to those who don't know Chinese. But I do, I understand some Cantonese, which is a dialect of Chinese spoken most commonly by the \\"common\\" people, mainly from Canton. That is the language most of the people speak in this movie, except the Japs of course and those fighters from the North who spoke Mandarin. However, this is the reason why they redid the entire audio stream including the sound effects. They changed the audio from Cantonese to all Mandarin. I don't know why, perhaps this version was printed in China and they consider Mandarin the \\"official\\" dialect and kind of look down on Cantonese, Hakka, and other Chinese dialects.    To those who don't know the difference, this sucks because now the audio is too soft and the syncing is bad (you see a hit, then hear it, or vice versa) and they neglected to add back in some of the little verbal gestures Chinese people are known to make (like going \\"mmm\\" instead of actually saying yes, they did this in the original movie, but they omitted a lot of it in this print, instead, it's just silence).    But to those who understand Chinese, it also sucks because it takes the authenticity away since the film's locale's native language is Cantonese, so in real life, they would have been speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin, and people know this. That's why they had the inhabitants of this city speaking Cantonese and the fighters from the North that came down to challenge them spoke Mandarin. That is how it was and that is how they wanted to portray it. Now everyone spoke Mandarin and it's pretty annoying.    Either that or the Cantonese audio stream is so jarbled that I don't understand it. All I know is that when I first watched this movie, I understood almost all of it since I know Cantonese. When I bought this DVD, I couldn't understand any of it and had to use the subtitles... Not to mention I could barely hear it.    I don't know, the movie is a great movie, it is kind of like Fearless, but a little more historically accurate, Fearless was VERY inaccurate in terms of historical accuracy, this was a bit better, but the fighting is very different because this is Wing Chun, which is purely a close range fighting technique, which is where almost all fights end up anyhow so it's also the most practical of all martial arts in my opinion. You will almost NEVER get into a street fight where your opponent will stay a leg's length away from you so you can do Tae Kwon Do style kicks at them. That is completely unrealistic and exclusive to competition style fighting. In real fights, your opponent will tend to want to close the distance any chance he gets. So Wing Chun which focuses on close in, short arm fighting is perfect for that.    I suggest you watch this film, but I really would like to find a better print than this one, I know it exists because I've seen it not too long ago, a friend had it, but he doesn't have the box or anything and doesn't know what version it is.
B00Q7WBGHG|2|not exactly what i was expecting.....more of a musical. from the looks of the picture on the case it should have been a bit more suspenseful
B00GD9F59S|5|Now that is the way to end a series!  True to the story and characters, yet the reader is happy too!  I absolutely loved this story and these characters. I can't help but think the last two pages left the door wide open for even more to be told about their future.  I have never been disappointed when reading this author's work.  Count me in for the next series!
B00IRISI42|4|Just marginally more cerebral and marginally less violent, Puller pulls off stunts and shoots strait in a book I found difficult to put down.  Highly recommended for the summer reading season when you want to get away from it all with no socially redeeming value other than entertainment.
B0099RFVXQ|5|Excellent movie. Star power works here...
B0089EHWQE|3|It was OK but I wouldn't spend money on it ... a nice story but everything that happened seemed predictable. I had it figured out about half way through.
B00C3HN1RM|5|This, in my humble opinion, was an extremely enjoyable post-apocalyptic series. Suzanne Collins hit the nail on the head with this one. While it was obvious that Katniss struggled over her feelings for Gale, throughout the books.... it was watching her slowly fall in love with Peeta, that I enjoyed. Watching how they worked, separately and together, to survive the two hunger games, and see how others willingly worked to save them, was a brilliant twist, to them ultimately being saved by a long forgotten district. It was there, in District 13, that Katniss found something born inside her... an inner strength, to fight the Capital, and those with evil intention of the 13th District. While I wished for a longer epilogue (as I always do) it was wrapped it in a nice little package, with a pretty bow on top.<br /><br />I would love to see a sequel to this series. To watch the children of Katniss and Peeta, grow up in this new world. To see how Gale lives his live, in a new district, separate from the woman he's loved, for years. And to see how all of the districts face life in this world, after the destruction of the rulers who caused so much chaos in the lives of those outside of the Capital.

B000JMKTLO|2|I had a very hard time getting into Sharp Objects. In fact, I never really did. I just finished it to see what would happen and if I were correct in my thoughts on who the murderer was. I didn't expect to be right since I have not been able to figure out the ending of the other two books by the author, both of which I really enjoyed.<br /><br />Camille gets sent back to her hometown to report on the death of two young girls. She stays with her family who are all crazy and messed up. A lot of people in the town are just...really most of the interactions with most of the people are so strange. It is like a town full of strange people. Pretty quick I had my suspicions as to who the murderer was. It never really changed throughout the book, even though the author tried to make it seem like someone else close to that person was doing it. I never really bought that, even though they were responsible for other harm and death to someone else.<br /><br />I never really connected with any of the characters and I think that might be why I had a hard time connecting with the book in general. As I said everyone is so strange. I couldn't identify with most of the people in the story. I couldn't quite grasp why they were so odd for me, why everything that happened was so off for me. Camille's mom just seems crazy, her step dad like he is just in his own world, her half sister is ferocious and scary, everyone just...I wouldn't want to spend any time in this town. The detective brought in from out of town to help with the case...well he wasn't really any better. I could never get a feel for him, or as I said already anyone. It was very confusing for me as I didn't get it.<br /><br />The one thing I did like about the book was Camille's obsession with words. I found that very interesting. It was interesting how she started just writing down everything, how she would then cut words into her skin, how she clung to words. It was my favorite part of the story. I didn't like Camille though. She was so weak and needy. I understood why, but she never really seemed to grow or anything. She was just all over the place for me and I didn't understand why she did some of the things she did.<br /><br />Overall it was a very strange read for me. The killer was who I thought it was from the start. I just could never get into the story or identify with anyone. I really have no real feelings toward the book. I didn't hate it, I didn't really dislike it, I didn't love it or even like it either. It is one of those books that will just fade into the background for me. Very odd.<br /><br />This review was originally posted to [...]eedy. I understood why, but she never really seemed to grow or anything.

B0031KC8OC|5|Still love this show after all these years. We are watching it again and it is just as enjoyable. Kristen Bell shows girls can be beautiful, smart and pretty darn awesome with her roll as Veronica. This is a must watch. Don't give up after the first episode if you aren't sure as it only gets better as the season continues.

I guess we love our high animal protein diets too much. For those of you who have health problems, take heed to the words inside this book.
B00457WZEI|4|I enjoyed this book about a horse, its travels, and the humans who cared for him.  It was a quick read, and fairly enjoyable.  For me, the ending made the whole thing worth it.  It was very moving and very sweet.

B00CNQ7HAU|3|I liked the book, but it ultimately didn't live up to A Time To Kill. But it would be hard to do that because A Time To Kill was Grisham at his finest.<br /><br />If you go into the book not expecting it to be on par with the first book, you'll enjoy Sycamore Row better. It meandered and dragged a little at times, but I'm glad I stuck with it because Grisham wraps things up nicely in the end (while of course leaving himself plenty of room to write yet another sequel). Ultimately it was a fun, enjoyable read, and it was a good book to read on vacation.
B00VFTAXUC|3|A little predictable. Good plot and action
B007IXWL2C|5|This has to be the most erotic and romantic book I have ever read!!!  I'm usually not into romance BUT this is... UNBELIEVABLE!!! It makes me want to read everything from this author!!!

0316067598|5|Marcus Lattrell and his comrades of Seal Team 10 have taken their place in the pantheon of American heroes.   I could not put this book down, its very well written with action that carries the reader away. What really drives this all home is that its all true.  Marcus starts his story in East Texas-his home where he was brought up with country values and parents that believed in America and what she stands for. At a young age he decided he wanted to be a SEAL. He joined the Navy and began the incredible odessey that would transform him into one of rhose legendary warriors.  Sent on a mission to stake out a camp of Taliban fighters that also contained a very high ranking terror leader, SEAL Team 10 was discovered by accident and all hell broke loose. A bloody firefight ensued between the four members of the SEAL Team and 200 terror fighters. The Seals kill over half of the enemy force but lose three of their own. Marcus is the lone survivor but he`s wounded. Four days of trying to escape and evade the enemy through the brutal Afghan mountains is an incredible story in itself as well as Marcus` stumbling into a place of help.  This is a must read. You will come away with a strong sense of national pride that our armed forces still produces true heroes.    Pat Leslie  Texas

B0093X805W|5|Just finished reading this classic with my 6 year old granddaughter. It was a thrill introducing her to a story I loved as a child. She was fascinated from beginning to end, and wants to enjoy more of Roald Dahl's stories.  Follow the book's suggestion, shut off the tv and curl up with your little one back to the country of imagination you remember.

B006CEKZ4Y|5|Citizen Kane is one of the greatest films ever made. It belongs in any film fan's collection. You probably already know that. The blu-ray looks amazing and sounds very good considering the film's age. The extras are informative and entertaining, particularly the Roger Ebert commentary and The Battle Over Citizen Kane documentary on the second disc. (It should be noted that RKO 281 is NOT included with the Best Buy exclusive digibook).
098478280X|5|I bought this book and elements of programming interview(EPI). Multiple solutions are given for almost every question and what to discuss with the interviewer is presented. Cracking the coding interview is easier to understand, has better explanation and coding style than EPI. EPI has more algorithmic problems. I got summer internship at amazon after practicing some problems in this book, and I suggest this book to every serious interviewee (and practice).
B000002H97|2|This album signaled the beginning of the end for Metallica.  No other band in history &quot;sold out&quot; worse than they did, and this was the start.   Boring songs, boring riffs, boring album. This band died with Cliff Burton.
B002KQ6BT6|5|Another great Robert Langdon mystery.
B000Q6GXW2|5|Frank Miller adaptations are on a roll. First we got \\"Sin City,\\" and now we have the story of three hundred Spartans who repelled a massive invasion.<br /><br />And the adaptation of \\"300\\" is a stunning one -- literally stunning, since it bombards the viewer with larger-than-life characters, smashing visuals and tight direction. It goes a bit too fast for its own good, but it's a truly epic film that takes the historical war movie to another level -- all the more so because it actually happened.<br /><br />As the introduction tells us, the Spartans were the ultimate warrior people. Babies were inspected for weakness or faults, and killed if they had any; as they were growing up, they were taught and toughened by a savage regimen. Their only true hope was to \\"die beautifully\\" for their land.<br /><br />A Persian messenger arrives, telling King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) that the god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) wants the Spartans to bow to him. Leonidas' response: shove the Persians into a pit. But before he can go to war, he must consult the corrupt priesthood of Ephors and their beautiful Oracle. She predicts that Sparta will fall and the gods forbid war at the approach of the Carneaian festival -- courtesy of a hefty bribe from a Spartan traitor.<br /><br />So Leonidas takes out three hundred of his best men, along with their nervy Arcadian allies, and begin trouncing the Persians. But they are being sabotaged, both by a hunchbacked outcast and by a treacherous councilor, whom Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is battling. And so at Thermopylae, Leonidas prepares for a final battle against the monstrous Persian Army -- knowing that their story of freedom will live on.<br /><br />This is not a \\"sensitive\\" movie where you have any appreciation for the bad guys -- it's a glorification of three hundred soldiers who died for their land and freedom. It just wouldn't work otherwise. It doesn't blindly adore the Spartans -- we see their darker side in their \\"weed out the weak\\" policy -- but it does appreciate them. They respect and care about each other, and Leonidas is as kind as he can be even to Ephialtes, the traitor.<br /><br />And it's done in a manner appropriate to its comic book origins -- grimy, bloody and epic, but with a stylized look that is almost like CGI. The battles are shockingly good, and full of fantasy-ish creations like the monstrous creatures or the silver-masked Immortals. Even a wall of corpses. But we also get some beautiful visuals as well -- roiling seas, sunlit battlefields, Spartan cities, and the drugged Oracle in her white veil.<br /><br />While the script gets a bit over-the-top at times, it's hard not to be moved by dialogue that can be darkly funny (\\"It's just an eye. The gods saw fit to grace me with a spare\\") or stirring (\\"He did not wish tribute, nor song, or monuments or poems of war and valor. His wish was simple: \\"Remember us.\\" That was his hope, should any free soul come across that place, in all the countless centuries yet to be\\").<br /><br />Butler and Headey are simply great as Leonidas and Gorgo -- they're both strong, passionate and fearless, and they both do a great job in their separate storylines. But the movie is filled with good performances -- David Wenham as the narrator, Dominic West as a disgusting traitor, Santoro as the decadent, arrogant god-king, and many others.<br /><br />This version contains both the regular and high-def versions, and apparently contains a small wealth of extras -- featurettes about the history of Thermopylae and the 300 Spartans, photo galleries, info on the Spartan culture, commentary, deleted scenes, and info on Frank Miller (who, of course, wrote the original graphic novel). It's sort of the decorative icing on a cake -- not necessary to enjoy the film, but it makes it just a bit better.<br /><br />\\"300\\" is a unique, stirring, stunning movie that pushes the action-movie envelope, and gives a thrilling edge to a real-life story of overwhelming power. A brilliant movie.
B006ID6NDQ|5|I enjoyed this book very much. Not every Jew went into hiding or ended up in a concentration camp. It was interesting to read about the different ways Edith had to change herself and lie in order to survive.
B000HWZ5XI|5|Excellent Robert Plant record.  The remastered edition with bonus tracks works very well for me.  Highly recommend.
B001CTDH4Y|5|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Before seeing 'Beverly Hills Chihuahua' I was expecting a completely insipid comedy strictly for ten year old's. Boy was I wrong. 'Chihuahua' is one of the best comedies I've seen in the last few years. It's got an 'A' story with a cast full of talking dogs and a 'B' story consisting of a supporting cast of humans. The star is 'Chloe', the cutest little Chihuahua you'll ever meet, expertly voiced by Drew Barrymore. Chloe is a prissy, pampered Beverly Hills doggie diva owned by a highly successful cosmetics CEO, 'Aunt Viv' (played by a still good-looking Jamie Lee Curtis). Aunt Viv's only sin is that she indulges her precious Chloe but is basically a very good person. That's evidenced by her warm treatment of the newly hired Hispanic landscaper, Sam (warmly played by Colombian actor, Manolo Cardona). Sam's Chihuahua, Papi (hilariously voiced by George Lopez) falls in love with Chloe and later figures in her rescue.<br /><br />Chloe's counterpart is Viv's niece, Rachel, who also needs to learn a few life's lessons by not talking down to people (Rachel assumes that the 'lowly gardener' Sam, can only speak Spanish). Meanwhile Chloe's uppity attitude is exposed from the very beginning. She's \\"born to shop, not fight\\"--and proudly proclaims she's an heiress; only to be met by one of her buddy's retorts: \\"a hairless\\". Chloe objects: \\"Not a hairless...I have a trust fund.\\" When Aunt Viv has to fly to Italy on a business trip, she leaves Chloe in Rachel's charge. Disaster strikes when Rachel impulsively drives down to Mexico with some of her friends and Chloe ends up getting 'dog napped' by criminals who hold dog fights in Mexico City. The head of the dog nappers is the nasty Vasquez who has an evil Doberman, El Diablo, (menacingly voiced by Ed James Olmos), who all the other dogs fear.<br /><br />Despite all her spunk, Chloe manages to remain out of touch even when she finds herself in the middle of a dog ring about to be chomped on by El Diablo. First off, she mistakes the applause of the seedy crowd as approval when in fact they're laughing at her, expecting her imminent demise. Chloe has some great lines though, inside the ring (\\"Clearly I'm not in the right place--call the concierge\\"; along with telling El Diablo that she knows a great dentist in Beverly Hills who can clean up his yellow teeth!). Chloe is saved by a former police dog, Delgado, a gutsy, world weary German Shepherd voiced by a perfect, gravely voiced Andy Garcia. I was in stitches when Delgado dumps Chloe in the muddy puddle of water and proclaims Delgado has got her scent--and she replies \\"Of course he does, it's Chanel #5\\".<br /><br />Rachel realizes the big mistake she's made and leaves her friends to find Chloe. There's a very funny scene when she gets a call from Aunt Viv at the police station and she has to pretend she's Chloe barking into the phone. Meanwhile, Chloe, now all muddied up, returns to her hotel and gets a taste of her own medicine: a bunch of snobby poodles want the horrible mutt immediately evicted from the premises. Chloe stares in horror at herself in the mirror and exclaims: \\"I'm hideous\\". Now she's beginning to realize that she's not so special.<br /><br />When Rachel meets up with Sam at the police station, the police only have limited information on the dog ring's whereabouts. Sam wants to wait for more information, but Rachel insists on continuing the search for Chloe on their own. Papi states he's with Rachel and utters the film's #1 iconic line: \\"We're Mexican, not Mexican't\\". Soon Chloe discovers the ever so cute con men, Rat and Iguana, and I almost fell out of my chair laughing when Chloe observes them fighting and exclaims: \\"This is just like Animal Planet\\"!!! Then when El Diablo confronts the rat after he pilfers Chloe's diamond collar, the rat has that great line: \\"Please don't eat me, I've got a wife and 300 kids to feed.\\"<br /><br />Wouldn't you know it but coyotes smuggle thedogs over the border! Eventually, Chloe and Delgado find themselves in the desert where Delgado reveals his dark secret: he's lost his sense of smell. Then our doggie heroes have their 'dark moment' when a bunch of mountain lions are about to have them for lunch. The film is just full of so many incredible surprises--there's a sandstorm, kicked up by a pack of Chihuahuas, led by the mighty Montezuma (aka Monte). It's Monte who gives Chloe a dose of 'Chihauhua pride' and the film's loftiest moment is when the Chihuahuas loudly proclaim: \\"No mas, no mas!\\" Rachel still needs to learn a lesson when she and Sam come upon some strays and she says with disdain: \\"Just what we need--stray dogs\\"; and it's Sam who wisely points out: \\"Papi was a stray dog\\".<br /><br />Things are neatly wrapped up when Chloe and Delgado aid in their own rescue by gaining the attention of a couple of Mexican Park Rangers. Soon, the evil Vasquez appears on the scene and snatches Chloe again (he's figured out that Chloe's owner is worth a lot of money). Delgado's arc is complete when he regains his sense of smell and leads the police to Vasquez, saving Chloe in the process.<br /><br />Both Chloe and Rachel have improved their lives after their great adventure. And they're both rewarded with true love along with their respective honeys (Papi and Sam). The further reward is that they get home just in time to prevent Aunt Viv from learning of Rachel's big faux pas.<br /><br />I don't know how Disney does it, but the direction of man's best friends in this film is superlative (undoubtedly some computer enhancement helped things along). 'Chihuahua' is not only funny but it's touching due to the underlying message of tolerance it so successfully conveys.lgado find themselves in the desert where Delgado reveals his dark secret: he's lost his sense of smell.

B0000AMRJC|5|Scarface is the best movie ever made!  Al Pacino is the ambitious young Tony Montana and comes to Miami with his best buddy Manny and also with Angel Fernandez.  Tony works his way from a lowely dishwasher to the biggest drug kingpin in Miami.  Tony kills Hector, Frank Lopez, Mel the cop, Manny, and million other people in the film.  Very depressing movie, it in someways reminds me of Titanic.  Both were EXCELLENT 3 hour long movies that both ended on a down note.  Watch Both Scarface and Titanic, two of the greatest and most amazing movies of the 20th century.
B00BUCXVPI|1|Didn't care for this one, not sure if it was the acting or the storyline, both were not very good.
B005GFPZYK|5|Gripping to read, it was hard to put down. A window into a secluded world. Honest and respectful accounts of actual events.
B005MMYBXI|5|I was hooked by this series--it really illustrates and get deep into the mindset of Spartacus.  I loved the movie so I was happy to see they made it into an awesome series.  I love Amazon Instant Video!
0061353248|5|The book was in great condition, and I enjoyed reading every chapter of it. Thanks for the book!
0316098337|2|I wish I could have given this book more than two stars. The premise - a mother and child held in captivity for years - is certainly great fodder for a gripping story. Unfortunately, the writer chose to use the child to narrate the story and, at least for me, it didn't work. I found myself distracted from the story by watching for inconsistencies in the dialogue and internal discourse. In dialogue, Jack, the child, might say, \\"It hurted.\\" But his internal discourse contained words like \\"besieged\\" -- a word beyond the reach of a five-year-old.  These inconsistencies were so annoying and I got so bogged down by them that I had to put the book down and give it a rest before I could start reading again. I ended up compromising. Rather than tossing the book aside, I read excerpts all the way to the end. What this book lacked was a thorough editing job. I'm surprised that Little Brown released it with all these inconsistencies. Gail Lowe, Author of Former Things
B006LSZECO|5|Helped explain the movie! A lot of details. Did not know who to side with for quite a while. Mysterious!
068817776X|3|This book was just okay. I kept waiting for Edith to do something heroic or memorable and worthy of a book being written about it but that never happened. There are many other stories/ books out there of Jewish survivors that actually did something worth writing about and sadly Edith is not one of them. She went from dating a loser to marrying another loser and did nothing except pretend to be someone else to survive. She did not help any of her fellow people in any way so again I ask...why the need to write a book about her story?

B00006M183|5|As a hardcore Pearl Jam fan, many might say that any review I have is biased, but don't be fooled!  I'm so inspired by this album, I felt compelled to tell the world (a.k.a. everyone browsing this section of Amazon) about how this will be one of the best purchases of your life.  <BR>While I love every other Pearl Jam album, Riot Act is the only one without any weak tracks at all.  Even \\"Arc\\" which is basically just Ed chanting is really moving and magical and painfully honest.  And like classic Pearl Jam, the first couple of spins you aren't so sure about it, but by the 4th or 5th time you hear it, you are hooked.  I can't stop playing this CD.  Vedder's best lyrics to date--inspirational and hopeful and genuine.  So many of these tracks have had their turn once and again as my favorites...it's hard to pick just a few stand out tracks.  <BR>Just by reading any articles or interviews that have been floating around about the band and this album, it is obvious that the guys are really proud of the tunes...and once you give this CD a listen it's easy to hear why.  Pearl Jam is the best example of a band that has truly evolved and has only gotten better with time.
B00I8Q77Y0|3|it isn't a Bad game but it isn't the best game ever, it is a bad representation or flappy bird
B0000025KI|5|The Boss at his peak. Surely, 'The River' has endured the test of time...I like it more now than I did when it was first released so many years ago. Like the work of artists he's always wanted to be like at least spiritually, Dylan and Van Morrison, 'The River' has never been easily digestible. All great work generally falls into that category...it takes repeated listening and sometimes years to grasp what the artist is presenting. And to risk the wrath of Bruce fans everywhere, I have to say that I think \\"Drive All Night\\" is the greatest song he's ever done. make yourself a Bruce mix tape or CDR and end it with \\"Born To Run\\", \\"Racing In The Street\\" and \\"Drive All Night\\". It does NOT get any better...

If you appreciate creative musicians who aren't afraid to experiment with their talent (and who really don't care whether you like them or not), you should buy it. Warning: This is NOT touchy, feel good, honey, muffin, pumpkin music like you hear in airports and dentist offices. It's not feeling; it's attitude, melted, mixed, and amplified.

0446677450|1|I still can't comprehend how anyone thinks that Kiyosaki's garbage is going to lead them to the holy grail of financial freedom.  He has made most, if not all, of his fortune peddling his mindless garbage to idiots worldwide who are all too eager to lap it up.  I'm guessing these are the same high school dropouts with  horrendous credit and no assets who have enriched late night infomercial kings errrr....financial powerhouses like Carleton Sheets, Don Lupre, and Russ Whitney.  Do a little research and you'll quickly find that there is absolutely no documentary evidence to support the investment activities Kiyosaki claims to have excelled in.  Many of these activities, by the way, are required by law to be disclosed in public records.  Some of the sane 1 star reviewers like myself have wisely suggested that if you are truly interested in reading Kiyosaki's worthless ramblings, check out his nonsense from the library rather than buying it.  Saving money by not purchasing his snake oil is far better financial advice than you'll find in any of Kiyosaki's books.  Oh yeah, that qwack C.P.A. who aligned herself with him (clearly just a parasite on his gravy train) should have her license revoked.

B000003S5H|4|Without being pretentious this CD has to be one of the best of the year for a mainstream release.  Gorgeous, floaty, jazzy, trippy at times, harsh and crunchy at others.

I love him when he is dirty and sweaty. He is a believable common man hero. He doesn't go through mud and dirt and fighting and in the next scene be squeaky clean. The price is great and I was pleased with the unrated version.
B00000J7JO|5|The Red Hot Chili Peppers continue to grow musically. The history of the  band is amazing as well as their music. Buy this CD and enjoy it time and  time again!
0439023483|5|This book is shocking, intriguing and different. It's a good book that keeps you interested. There's a point to everything, everyone at all points. Never a dull moment. Great read :)
B00OKYQZDI|5|i love this game
B0000000LI|5|I have some other works of Yanni - some studio recordings of his. They were soft and soothing but at some points they are a sort of bore. Then I bought this title. 'Awesome' is the first word that comes to my mouth. I think it is Yanni's best performance ever. His vibrant tunes are arranged in an exotic manner. The music is good and the arrangement and sequencing is the work of a genius. The bass, violin and bass guitar backgrounds are truly great. I would rate the songs in this order: Within Attraction (best of all, just listen to it! Violins, percussion - it has everything), Swept Away(very good), Keys of Imagination (the rythm pattern is same as that of 'Within Attraction' but the percussion part is great), The Rain Must Fall (depends on your taste, has a nice guitar part), Acroyali (lively) and Santorini (sheer grandeur). The other tracks are good too.
B004GCPJDQ|5|Works great, it's very easy to use, and no more buying batteries! I'm really glad I invested in this product.
B0058VW36U|1|I know how much fun this game can be as I've played it on other platforms but when the game takes 5 minutes to load, it really turns into a dud! So fix what ever you need to fix to make the game not take soooooo long to load &amp; you might get a better review!
B001TCHDPS|5|&#34;Just climb up on my music and my songs will set you free&#34; he sings. &#34;just climb up on my music and from there jump off with me&#34;. And that is exatly what I do listening to this album loving it from word to track and back. Over and over again. His soulful and intelligent songs are easy and mysteriously deep at the same time. Like the magnificent song &#34;Cause&#34; with great poetic lines like &#34;while the rain drank champagne&#34;, &#34;my heart's become a crooked hotel full of rumours&#34; and &#34;how many times can you wake up in this comic book and plant flowers&#34;. His words and music sure are planting flowers in my mind.
B00MIA0L9U|5|If it were vinyl, I would have already worn out the grooves.
B005OT2YVA|5|Good movie. I have this on my amazon account. And I've seen it. It's a good movie.
B0020BUWX2|5|gf liked it
B000002H97|5|I think this CD rocked! I absolutly love METALLICA and I think this was their best album so far. It has so many great songs on it, the lyrics are so awesome they just make you think about stuff. I especially liked Nothing  Else Matters, next to Fade to Black that is my favorite Metallic song.
B00T3DNKIE|4|A good read
0688170528|5|I as unable to put this book down, and when I would it was all I thought about.  Jodi Picoult is an extrememly talented story teller.<br />The Pact was the most mesmorizing story of two young lovers and that grew up together  and shared everything (almost).<br />I have given this book to every single  person I know that loves a good love story, and they have passed it on as  well!
B002WV5A9G|5|Amazing!
B001TKK39S|4|A few years ago DG-Universal reissued all of Bernstein's Haydn recordings for that label as part of their Bernstein Edition.  Those were digital recordings from the 1980's edited together from live concerts (Bernstein's preferred  modus operandi at that point in his career) and from an interpretive point of view they were inconsistent at best--sometimes insightful, but more often heavy and listless.  Bernstein aged badly as a conductor and, regrettably, his decline extended to a composer with whom he always had a strong affinity.  His earlier Haydn recordings for CBS/Sony, however, were renowned in their day for their vigor, rough humor, and boundless enthusiasm.<br /><br />Sony has done Haydn and Bernstein aficionados a tremendous favor by reissuing these now-classic recordings of the *Paris* and *London* Symphonies (plus no. 88), *Creation* and four out of the six late Masses, housed in a fairly sturdy space-saving box. Sony's asking price  is relatively high for such boxes these days (compare with recent offerings from EMI, such as their \\"Complete Oistrakh Edition\\"), especially since the skimpy booklet contains no annotations beyond the usual work-and-track listing. Moreover, within the box the CDs are gathered into laminated and hinged cardboard pockets that make the task of retrieving one more trouble than it should be.  The recordings have apparently not been remastered; that fact may account for the mediocre sonics throughout this collection.  The *London* Symphonies, in particular, suffer from thin, acidic-sounding strings, unduly recessed woodwinds, blaring brass (not Bernstein's fault), and a fair amount of distortion in the louder tutti passages. Moreover, the latest recording included here (a London-based *Theresienmesse* from 1979), though smoother-sounding, lacks bite and focus, largely due to a distant, mushy-sounding chorus.<br /><br />With those caveats out of the way (and they are sufficiently serious to cost my evaluation one star), I must affirm the legendary status of these recordings.  Bernstein brings enormous gusto to Haydn, and the result is an altogether winsome marriage of intellectual and physical vigor.  This is Haydn without the wig.  In the Symphonies, Bernstein favors bold, incisive sonata allegros; deeply meditative and just as often bewitchingly mischievous slow movements; steady and stately minuets, with some delightfully humorous touches; and dashing finales.  Bernstein's earlier, and finer, account of *Creation* is truly a celebration of Nature in all its rough-and-tumble splendor; and the Masses are just as notable for their operatic as for their religious fervor.  The playing of the NYPO in the Symphonies, as well as the singing in the choral works, is quite variable--greater polish would have been welcome.  But Lenny's elemental vigor and warm-hearted embrace of Haydn's always-stunning originality  carry the day.<br /><br />Despite qualifications, strongly recommended, particularly to listeners increasingly dissatisfied with current performance-practice orthodoxies. Those who require more up-to-date sonics and more polished orchestral playing (with no diminution of \\"elemental vigor\\") should check out Solti's set of the *London* Symphonies (a steal at budget price) and Dorati's equally fine set of the *Paris* Symphonies (in an inexpensive \\"twofer\\" from Decca).  In the historical category there is, of course, Beecham (whose inimitable late mono/early stereo traversal of the twelve \\"London\\" Symphonies sounds newly minted on exceptionally fine EMI transfers, available at budget price).tatus of these recordings.

B00G3L6KQI|5|When I bought the first book: \\"A Discovery of Witches \\" I had no idea what I was getting into.  This author is very gifted, she has done a lot of research into human history, poetry, song, DNA research, and the history of witches, daemons and vampires.  She used all this information to write a trilogy of books that I was unable to put down despite each book's length of over 500 pages.  When I finished the first book in the series, I was so glad I had a Kindle and could immediately order the other two books and begin reading again!  Ms. Harkness has perfected the art of leaving the book with a cliff hanger ending so that you can't wait to read the next book to find out what happened to the hero and heroine!  Diana and Matthew were wonderful characters and their love story became richer and richer as the story unfolded.  There were incredible twists and turns in the plot, this was not a predictable read by any means.  So, to anyone who enjoys an engrossing historical romance with engaging characters and no way of predicting how the story will unfold, I can guarantee you will enjoy this trilogy!
B00M7D82E4|3|The story line was good but the extreme violence took away from the story. The twist at the end was interesting.
B002SR2PKG|5|This is the first King book I ever bought, and I still remember the moment I bought it while on a shopping excursion with my grandmother when I was only fifteen. I remember marveling at its size, but I was undaunted: I consumed the words and pages as a ravenous bookworm and had it all read within a matter of days. To date, it is the only King book I read more than once and when the Kindle came out I was disappointed that this book wasn't available. Now that Signet finally made their King library finally available for the Kindle, I immediately purchased it so that I'd have it forever. It is King's best work, and as you can see from the reviews I am hardly alone in that opinion. I strongly urge you to purchase this book. You will be far from disappointed that you did.
B0064MGU98|5|Terrific acting and writing.
B00BRUYQFC|5|I love this album with the exception of 1 song. Aside from that, I'm glad he is back and brings a new sound to the music industry. He is changing the game!
B00ADIT8U2|5|I have always been fascinated by Nikola Tesla and all his amazing work/creations, and innovative ideas. Truly a man out of his time. This game is a neat little homage. Fun to explore and find.  Simple, yet you do need to figure some things out. It's way more rewarding if you don't cheat.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Did not disappoint!
B0000CDL3W|5|love it thanks
1932100660|5|Very interesting study
B000QCQ8Y4|5|In true Reacher fashion. Story builds as Reacher slowly figures out the problem. He is a hard man! Don't mess with Reacher
B002F6FQGK|5|I'm pretty sure I listened to the entire album 100+ times by now. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. Can't wait for the next one. Best songs?<br /><br />-dog days are over<br />-rabbit heart<br />-howl<br />-cosmic love<br />-drumming song
6304233639|4|I SAW THIS THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT ON THEATRES.  I BAUGHT IT THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT ON VIDEO!  NOT REALISTIC, BUT VERY ENTERTAINING.  WHY WRITE A REVIEW NOW? BECAUSE IT'S COMING ON TELEVISION TONIGHT.  I REALLY ENJOYED  THIS PRODUCTION, WHICH I THINK, AND MY FRIENDS THOUGHT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO  RESULT IN A HIGH 4 OUT OF 5.
B00LLQ28LQ|5|This was great. Enjoyed it very much.
B007ZGO7EM|5|this calculator is great I use it every day it is great I love it it is easy to use to and its free so that's why you should get it
B00LD1OHE0|5|My first book by Colleen Hoover. Fast, addicting,  interesting story.  Will be reading more by her asap.
B005CAAVVQ|5|What a joy to find a new expression and genre' from this talented guy and his amazing band
0142419400|5|A very sweet book. It's predictable, but still very enjoyable. The ending will make you smile for hours after you finish it. A wonderful feel-good book and always puts me in a good mood. Plus, the French background is beautiful.
B00005JNTX|5|Lots of stylized, cartoon-like violence.  Great acting...unique film style.  Every story...practically every scene...keeps your gaze fixed to the screen.  I was on the fence but glad I bought it...and have watched it twice in a 24-hour period!
B005HSL626|5|my son and daughter and myself love to play this trying to beat each others high score, we have the one for the Kinect and this one is the same amount of fun for long car rides since u just use your fingers, very fun
B0020BUWX2|2|Thought it was a good book but had a predictable ending and was more for teenagers rather than an adult
B002L3ARRU|5|After all of these years, this was my first time watching the entire movie. I have seen clips, but never the whole thing.
B00004R99L|5|Alice and Wonderland is wonderful in so many ways!  It's so fun and entertaining that it's hard to describe.  You'll get the songs stuck in your head!  OK, ok...  Just to let you know, if you want a DVD collection with classics, you'll definitely have to get Disney's Alice in Wonderland.  It's a great DVD with cool features.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Love this game. I am so addicted to this game stayed up all night playing. Me and my kids play all the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5|this game is so addicting! the graphics are very well done and so far I have had no problems with it
1401234550|5|this was my first time reading green lantern im not all that familiar with him. i have seen First Flight and the live action movie. watched justice league and all that good stuff. but for the most part i don't know much about green lantern. At first i was confused because i thought the new 52 was a reboot so people like me could get into the comics. but i felt like i jumped right into the middle of a already established timeline. i was able to pick everything up the history and what had happened up until that point. they did a good job of filling me in without going into to much detail. i have to say i couldn't put this down! it was that good. loved every second i read this. everything about it is fantastic! now i just need to go and buy Volume 2.
B009NQZVKG|4|Very good story with excellent details. Adding a history lesson along with detailed action made this book hard to put down.
B00DJFIMW6|5|soooooo fun I enjoy it so much. I love this game I am obsessed with this game soooooo MUCH. I have to stop saying much.
B00AZMFJYA|5|The best Star Trek movie in years. The new crew is excellent and the story is good, although it brings back a couple of old enemies in this new reality that skirts off the true nature of their reality and did not explore it suffiently in my opinion.. I will not tell you who this is referring to. All the actors are on their game and seem to understand what Trekkies need and want and don't deviate too much from the original concept.A worhty note:Simon Pegg-EXCELLENT! What a gifted actor. This movies is fast and entertaining. You love it.
B00FRQ32N4|5|Fun so to kill time even though it can be a money sink. I like the lan play option with a forth coming online multi player option.
B009VB97EY|1|Although this movies was watchable, it was not more than that.  You would have to be a very desperate housewife to be turned on by this movie.  It was very lacking after all the build up the media gave it.  The story was weak, and the supporting actors didn't know how to act, they were emotionless robots just reading their lines.  I was highly disappointed.
B00ABGEFWC|4|luv the cute pets! :D it is awesome.  soooo cool. luv it soooo much!  &lt;3 :-P_ me hearts it!!!!!! get it. vewry coot! :D
B003G4W49C|5|Just read it for the 3rd time and still love it.<br />Can't wait for the movie in November with Harrison Ford.<br />Check out Ender's Shadow as well for the same story from a different perspective.
B009T8XBBO|5|I like this type of game. The only thing I dislike is that there aren't more games like this for the kindle fire.
B00WSD2BGS|5|Great movie for the entire family.
B00N6PD3GE|5|Good read!
B00L9B7IKE|5|This book is responsible for my late nights.  I just could not stop reading it.  Loved it!
B00JJV4QZG|5|One of funniest/saddest books I've read in years. David Nicholls is an amazing writer, he made me laugh out loud while reading, which I usually don't do. But there's underlying pathos as well. A wonderful read.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Challenging and addicting!
B00280LYIM|5|My second favorite of the entire Riordan universe. Why? The labyritnth. Genius. Battle. Love. Tension. Grit. Friendship. I think this story must be allegorically parallel to my own. I resonated with all the struggle, confusion, and everything.<br /><br />Thank you, Rick Riordan, for writing such an excellent series.
B004H1V5RU|5|You will not defeat P.E. It will taunt you, mock you... You will plan your strategies and apply them only to be thwarted again and again. You will put it away but in plain eyesight where you will look at it and say to yourself, &#34;soon Perplexus, soon&#34;. Friends and family will also try but their defeat, added to yours will only feed it, make it stronger. So does it hold appeal? It doesn't just hold it, it emanates it.
B004LSO6YI|2|Movie kept stopping and was not in focus,I wil not be renting anymore movie, I just gave money away that night for a bad experience.
030758836X|4|Loved majority of the book. I wanted Nick to get his revenge so bad and for it to end, like that?! HUGE disappointment. As I turned the last page to see the acknowledgements, I literally said \\"WHAT! WHAT?! There better be a part 2!\\" and threw the book on the floor. hahaha. I don't regret reading it, because it was so suspenseful and entertaining but spiraled out of control toward the end, and AT the end it was such a unsatisfying, dull, ending.
B0089LOG02|5|I loved it.
B000JML7EC|5|My quest through the free Kindle classics continued with Treasure Island.Having never read this book it was all new to me.I found it was very well written as it kept me roped in to the story from start to finish and was  perfectly formatted for the kindle.This book should be required reading in school! If you are looking for a good fun read for all ages this book should be on your list.
B0063IH60K|5|Always love this game and having it on the phone keeps my wife busy on trips. Would download again. FREE
B006AZZPCM|4|Works well
B00FKF0F3C|1|A poor ending to this trilogy.  Not like Ken Follett, who has been one of my favorite authors.  And his anti-Americanism sure shows; his facts are very deficient.  All that explicit sex is unnecessary and finally boring.
B000006TRV|5|Excellent
0439023491|4|So Katniss Everdeen survived the Hunger Games, but President Snow has noticed her rebellious streak. She is still adjusting to the victor life, when the President warns her that her rebellious attitude is spreading like a virus throughout the districts. He even threatens that if she doesn't find a cure, uprisings will begin and he will make sure everyone she loves is killed.<br /><br />Then an announcement from the Capitol that the next Hunger Games is the 75th anniversary called the Quarter Quell. This Quarter Quell brings the surprise that the Games participants will be chosen from the Victors. Since tradition says the Games Victors are supposed to be protected from any future participation, Katniss is sure this Quarter Quell is President Snow's way to squash any plans for rebelling.<br /><br />I thought this sequel was a little bloodier and sadder yet still exciting. I would recommend this to possibly older middle grade to young adult and up.
0375805613|5|When we had our daughter last year, my parents gave me a box of MY childhood books, to share with her. In it was the \\"Little Golden Book\\" version of The Monster at the End of This Book. Caroline grabs it every day, and my husband and I love to do the silly voices when reading it to her.<br />Well, I saw in the bookstore one day that it is still being sold! And in \\"board book\\" version! I have bought several as gifts already, and will continue to do so. It's a guaranteed good time for kids AND parents!
1101898437|5|Love this collectors edition book! Its cool looking and you get some fun stickers along with free online download. : )
B00AREIAI8|5|I love this game
B005XQLBU4|5|got it free worth paying for.  very addictive game nice controls. great graphics and sound... top quality game  give it a try you wont be disappointed
B002R88G4U|5|what a delightful read .... I loved the constant flow of letters in particular the exchange between Sidney and  Juliet - their special and warm friendship was with its humor and trust. I miss the days of letter writing ...of the waiting for the delivery of a little envelope holding the prospect of silent moments of sharing. It is perhaps why I loved this novel so much ....nothing of on going story telling but rather the stories of each individual.<br />A positively lovely and delightful read and one which has raised my curiosity of Guernsey.
B00D7Z4GQY|3|Enjoyed the overall human quandaries explored in this book. Several intertwined lives included in this book that did not fully come together. Overall an interesting and pleasant read.
B00EY8A6BC|3|I enjoyed seeing Michael Caine laughing all the way to the bank with his fee for the film. He is still a scene stealer. Ditto for Morgan Freeman, but his talent was wasted in this film. The rest of the cast just didn't hold my attention nor elicit any warm & fuzzy feelings because of the heavy and overwhelming use of the special effects. The plot was interesting but derivative. Entertaining but nothing to write home about.
B0030ZOYHC|5|This is an amazing and unique Blu-Ray. Evangelion is for a long time one of the most seen anime in Japan and maybe in the World. This rebuild shows us how Evangelion should be made from beginning. This is the Ultimate Version so far(even though I think it can't get any better). This is a must buy.
B00C7KXUOE|5|Great show.
B00VFTA70I|5|Loved learning the history combined with great story of a talented team.
B002D0L0R2|5|Hair Spray is a very entertaining musical with great songs, but it also has some great messages of acceptance from loving yourself at any size to tearing down the barriers of racism.  Quality rendition of the show with a number of big stars...John Travolta, Nicole Kidman, Queen Latifah.  It can be hard to find movies that the entire family can enjoy together, but this one is appropriate for kids and grown up enough for the adults, too.  I definitely recommend!
B004FOA84A|2|I enjoy these types of games and this one has great graphics. I rated it low because it is more than 16 MB and can't be installed on the SD card.
B008Q07GLW|5|Just as fabulous as the first time I saw it in 1972!
B00B8M4IMK|4|Unfortunately, I never used this item until the short warranty period was over. The bottom line is it does not work. Do not waste your money. Now, I know why it is such a short warranty. BUYER BEWARE! I would give it 0 stars but that is not an option.<br /><br />Update: Anker contacted me when they saw my first review. They quickly sent me a new unit without cost. The new unit works fine. I was actually impressed with their customer service and willingness to stand behind their product. I have now changed my rating.
B000009VOL|5|It's late, my contacts are drying out and I'm tierd. But I can't go to bed, no I can't. You see my little brother's car has been egged for the past four nights in a row. When I go to get the paper, breakfast is served as well, I just scoop up some eggs which have been cook from the morning  sun.  It's best when they mistakenly come out sunny side up! I've had  enough though of walking on egg shells, I want to retaliate. So right now  Moon Pix (American Flag) the first track is playing.  I am mentally  preparing to strike back with the hose, and put out this rage these kids  have. Moon Pix Doesn't have one bad song on it.  I can listen to this cd  and find a new something each time. Oh man I hear eggs must go fight back  now. Just remember Moon Pix is eggselent. Complements to Cat Power. later  alligators.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|I'm hooked.  Well written and well acted!
B005DNO7MQ|5|Loved it when it came out and it only gets better every time I see it. Only regret was not paying more for HD.
B00000K2W1|5|My childhood friend in port arthur.....tragic and wonderful...nothing today comes close...so missed
B00003CXTG|3|Pearl Harbor is a story of two young pilots' friendship and their love for the same woman, paralleled with the attack on Pearl Harbor. As spectacular as the special effects are, this film has some character flaws. Kate Beckinsale (Evelyn) is a real beauty and is well-cast as her character from that perspective, but her acting isn't believable or moving. She doesn't make us feel her love or her sorrow. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character (Dorie Miller) lacks character development in the screenplay, which is a pity since he plays a real-life hero. Josh Hartnett (Danny) is the real surprise in the cast. He gave the most believable performance, and with his onscreen charisma and boyish good looks, Pearl Harbor will be this heartthrob's big break into stardom. I expected Pearl Harbor's love story to be a real tear-jerker, yet I barely shed a tear. Even though it's sad, it lacks what it takes to drain us of our emotions or make our heart skip a beat. On the other hand, this film gives us a historical look at the devasting attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the sinking of the U. S. S. Arizona and the roll-over of the U. S. S. Oklahoma and from that perspective, it will leave you breathless and break your heart.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|Fun for kids of all ages. I recommend this app to keep your kids busy especially during long car rides.
B0000DD7LB|5|i really loved this cd and love the whole tracklist every song was great and cant wait to see the next cd . iread the track list on [...] and thats great if its the right tracjklist go check it out.<BR>by the way she is so talent and every albu,m she releases is going better and better .
0060523794|1|I have not and will not buy this book.  Gerstner's approach was pure abuse, such as the way some animal trainers get wild animals to perform.  Gerstner was able to rid IBM of company loyalty, sacrifice investment in future products for immediate profitability, and bloat the salaries of a select few while making &quot;the most important resource&quot; totaly expendable.  He is a perfect example of the greedy CEO's who only understand how to pad their personal assets at the sacrifice of the corporation and its employees.
B00AKKGX4W|5|I could not put this book down!! At 5AM I finally fell asleep and I continued to finish the book.
B00GEEB9YC|5|I too was asleep for the majority of my life, however it was individuals like Sam Harris that helped wake me up. Many Christians are in a comatose state because of indoctrination and deep programming since birth and hopefully this book will be the tool that pulls them out of religious bondage.
B00AAQHP66|5|I went and saw this movie in theaters and fell in love fast!  Awesome waves, great actors, and an all out feel good movie! Gerard Butler plays a serious side in this movie and does a great job at it! Plays Frosty who teaches Jay how to ride big waves. Got its funny parts, but it also has its teary eyed parts. If you're a fan of surfing or the beach, check this movie out! Its pretty amazing! The message at the end says &#34;Live Like Jay!&#34;... After seeing how Jay lives with a smile on his face and always in a positive outlook no matter what life throws, Its easy to see why thats the message.
B003Z2LAAO|5|Enjoyed this movie.
B00KA7JIII|5|The game is not very large neither its puzzles complicated. But The idea is awesome and The graphics are beautiful.
B005LAIHSQ|2|The first thing I am going to say is had I seen this movie in the theater I would have been pissed. I think that Chris Hemsworth's and Charlize Theron are two very talented actors( the only reason I did not give it one star), but would somebody please tell me why Kristen Stewart gets millions for doing movies. If sucking in your breath and popping a tear out of your eye and mumbling your lines is all that is required then I qualify to be an actress. I started watching and Snow White as a little girl was alright. Then cut to the grown-up and yuck. As long as she does not talk it is better. Frankly, I could not wait for Chris Hemsworth to show up on screen, and as far as I am concerned he did not show up fast enough. The one funny line has The Huntsman cutting away her dress and she looks at him like she thinks he is going to ravage her. He looks at her and says \\" don't flatter yourself\\". That sums up just about everything about her. Watching them plod through the forest is torture.  The actors who play the dwarves are hilarious, they steal the movie. The scene where the two male leads talk about the inner light of Snow White and how you have to be blind not to see it, made me wonder if they got through that without gagging. To be blunt the most exciting thing about the movie was finding out she was not so snowy white and was sleeping with the director. I saw they were planning a sequel and I would like to know what for? I do believe they are plotting a spin-off for the huntsman, and if Chris Hemsworth is doing it I will be the first in line. Just not more of this same drivel.

B008BQ8VOC|5|I really enjoy the chemistry in this show between the different players. I think the writing is slick and sometimes something comes out of left field that you did not know was going to happen.
B00BUCW54Q|3|Not a bad movie although if you have read Jack Reachers  bboks  Tom Cruise is not exactly Jack Reacher<br />But movie was ok
B00L9B7IKE|2|It was just like Gone Girl. I wanted to throw the book across the room when I was done, but since it was my Kindle Fire, I decided not to.  It is a predictable story with unbelievable characters no one cares about nor would you want to.  Such a disappointment with all the hype.

B005LAJ1O0|5|Well into season two now, I wanted to go back and write a review of the first season of one of my favorite television series - especially as season two makes the first season look like \\"Mary Poppins\\" by comparison!<br /><br />After reading reviews here, I've realized that those who don't like the show tend to really HATE the show - often with nasty/insulting remarks about everything from the writing to the acting to Dylan McDermott's nude behind.  Am sort of wondering if this venom is because the show isn't mindless or gory enough; American fans of horror tend to like butchers and blood, I have a good friend myself who usually defines a \\"good\\" horror film by the body count.  The more people who die, and the more gruesome their deaths, the better the film.<br /><br />If that's you, you WILL probably hate \\"American Horror Story\\".  The writing here is more subtle, and much more clever.  It's about creeping you out slowly, confusing scenes that come to light later on (sometimes even in another episode) - if you just keep with it and let your brain be engaged instead of your visceral lust for blood and bodies, you'll \\"get\\" what's going on and understand the storylines and characters so much better.  It's a show that gets under your skin instead of assaulting your senses (and WOW, does season two amp up things, on this scale, a hundred-fold!), and even though season one and season two are two completely different anthologies - with completely different characters (some played by a handful of the same actors from season one) and story and even time-frame - I do think you're cheating yourself a bit if you don't watch the first season before viewing the second (especially to see Jessica Lange's brilliance).<br /><br />The story's been gone over before: the Harmon family - Ben (Dylan McDermott), Vivien (the brilliant and beautiful Connie Britton), and their teenage daughter Violet relocate from the east coast to Los Angeles, to start fresh after Ben and Vivien's marriage almost ended due to Ben's infidelity.  Ben got an incredible deal on a beautiful home, and only upon the Harmon's arrival do they learn it's because a death occurred in the home.  Well, more than one death.  In fact, a murder.  And suicide.  And more than one.<br /><br />In fact, their home is known as the Murder House due to its dark and macabre history - a history that starts reflecting itself immediately when we (the viewers) learn that the ghosts of those who've died violently in the home all remain there ... and can still have more than a little influence on the living.<br /><br />Jessica Lange MORE than deserved the awards gotten for playing next door neighbor Constance Langdon, a southern belle who is the only living person around who knows the true nature of the Harmon's home.  She has a basket-case of a son named Tate (Evan Peters, fast becoming one of the best actors of his generation working today), and a sweet-natured daughter named Addie (Jamie Brewer), a young girl with Down's Syndrome whose condition allows her to see the ghosts who walk the Harmons home when others cannot.<br /><br />All figure into the a slowly developing plotline that I won't divulge here - but this is, again, one series you cannot only half-watch!  NOT a show where you can get up and make dinner in between, and certainly please pause it if you have to use the john!  No, \\"American Horror Story\\" takes some thought to keep up with what's going on - and to get the meaning of some things that at first may seem meaningless.  It's smart, wicked, bizzare and very adult television (much like \\"Nip/Tuck\\", by the same creators) with a dark sense of humor ... that also becomes horribly addicting.<br /><br />And for gore-lovers ... don't worry, you got that coming in season two.st ended due to Ben's infidelity.

B001GKJ2E8|5|I actually rented this movie before I purchased it and it went above and beyond what I thought it would be. There was plenty of action, cool effects and the story wasn't too bad. If you want some serious acting and drama there are many other movies that James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman have starred in, check those out instead.<br /><br />Overall I had to give it 5 stars, simply because it was entertaining and I ended up having to buy it. Wasn't as predictable as most action movies are.
B001EN71CW|5|Really...whats not to love.  Firefly was an intelligent series that was canceled because of??? (why?)  It's wonderful to have this series on Blu-ray.  If you love Firefly...you OF COURSE will have to own it on Blu-ray!
B00DVKXZBM|1|I just contacted this seller today and they refused to give a me a refund! I made my original purchase on December 18, 2013. The DVDs were of poor quality and appeared to be bootleg! The excuse I received was that I was past the due date. This is poor customer service and I plan on taking this complaint further! I paid nearly $200.00 for copies or DVDs when they were advertised as new or original. This is a total rip-off and false advertisement. I will never purchase anything from this seller again and I have notified Amazon.
B000S1M9LY|5|Put in the time with this book and you will fall in love. Wallace is a genius. I'm not worthy.
B000050FEN|5|Stunningly morbid, Fincher's \\"Se7en\\" is a morose and disturbing flick without senselessness.<br />The plot is rich and textured. On the basis of the seven deadly sins, a serial killer plays out each sin in detail. Murder is the method, gluttony, greed, lust, envy and so on are each the subject matter, and apparent societal depravity is the canvas. Two police officers, a rookie detective, and a seasoned veteran, are left to put the pieces together and to try and stop the massacres from unfolding.<br />A deeply disturbing, and downright frightening, movie, \\"Se7en\\" accomplishes the purpose of this genre in a surprising and intelligent way. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptionally cast in roles each of them excel in, while Kevin Spacey's portrayal is nothing short of chilling.<br />The movie manages to surround you in a sense of morbidness. The rich texture (from, I've heard, the use of an innovative lens that alters the general colour of the movie) elicits a frightening calm, and a certain pitch and level of anticipation that captures the intent of the movie.<br />If you like this genre, \\"se7en\\" is worth more than a cursory look. Highly recommended.
B00FEMJF6O|5|Better than castleville
014242417X|4|Good Book.  A little more chick-flick than I had expected but I enjoyed it.  The first half of the book took me awhile to get into.  I had a hard time connecting with the characters.  But the second half I read in a day.

B00W3V83QW|4|This game has kept me entertained for months now.  My biggest annoyance is the built-in wait times to go into a higher level.  They make you wait a day or so for no good reason.  The shameless offers to buy more lives and/or invite others to give me their lives is somewhat of an unfortunate distraction, but it's not intrusive once you decline everything for each trial.
0439023521|4|Okay, we have seen this idea many times before in various forms.  Still, the author manages to craft a tale of young love, angst, social turmoil and inequality, and survival skills in a deadly battle witnessed by an entire country on reality TV.  Katniss is a sympathetic main character and first-person narrator that you cannot help rooting for as she tries to fend off starvation and care for her family while also being forced to kill people her own age and even younger.
B00DR0PDNE|4|I refuse to pay for cable, b/c I hate commercials and s*** TV. I rely on the interwebs for all my watching - on my terms!!!  A guy in the IT department at work says that people like me are called \\"cord cutters\\".  Sounds cool.  Anyway, I'm also rather low-fi in my tiny house.  We have one laptop and wheel out an AV cart when it's time to curl up to some boobtube.  So, the chrome-cast was a blessing. I can control the TV from my phone or PC, and yet still use the device for simultaneously Instragramming and writing verbose reviews on Amazon.  All while I watch endless series that are a season behind the \\"corded\\" world.    My one complaint - when you watch a series on Netflix, chromecast does not automatically start the next episode. A minor complaint, but seems like something they could fix??
B00555X8OA|5|I really enjoyed this book as it gave me much better understanding of the cognitive biases and how the manifest themselves.
0439023491|5|This is a great follow up to the Hunger Games. Collins shows why everyone loves these books and Katniss Everdeen so much.
B002I9Z89Y|5|Star Trek was one of the best shows ever. And this Blu-Ray does its job. THis is a great set, and brings the show to life. Put is set on a good Blu-Ray player and HD TV and you are in for a great ride.

1401923127|5|This is a book worth rereading.  Draws together the physical and spiritual work in a reasonable manner.  Worth the read!
B0000296SI|5|Blink 182's Enema of the State is a new and more general public friendly cd. The group is receiving an undeserved bad rap just for slowing down their pace, which has gained them a major label and sold them tons of cds. The teenybopper frenzy over them is just as disturbing to me as it is for other punk fans but what did Blink 182 really have to do with that? They are singing about the same topics that they have always sung about just in a light and friendly manner. It should not bother the other punk fans; they did not betray the music. It is still punk at heart. Besides, I would much rather be able to turn on the radio and hear them than some unrealistic boy band that does not write or even play their own music. All of Blink 182's songs are about real life and the experiences you pass through on the way. They are both passionate and honest and it is very refreshing to hear something worthwhile that you can relate to.    The songs often deal with teenage boys' angst of growing up and dealing with the problems every teenager faces. In &quot;Adams Song&quot; a boy faces what his place is in life, thinking of how insignificant he is in the harsh world that surrounds him, and contemplates whether life is worth living. In &quot;The Party Song&quot; a boy finds out that appearances are not always what they seem, and finds out that &quot;some girls try too hard.&quot; It is their beat that helps create the anti- everything rebellion that beats in every teenage heart that makes them appealing, but it is their playful angst and their cry for the truth and answers that really lures people in. They transcend through any genre that people try to catagorize them in. Their lyrical content, great musicianship, and overall true-to-life spirit will keep people coming back for more.
B006Y5H74W|5|Love it!  Wish it never had to end.
B00FKF0F3C|5|Wonderfully later book in the trilogy. Really felt  connected to all the family's.
B003ZSJ212|4|I pre-ordered the boxset back in January as soon as it was announced.  I'm a Star Wars fan and have been since I saw the original in the theater in 1977, and I've owned several different editions both on VHS and DVD over the years.     The set is packaged in a very sturdy slipcase.  Inside the movies are in a book format, with thick pages for each movie.  I was originally concerned about scratches, but the slots that each disc slide into seem to have a coating on them that keep them from slipping around and they actually fit pretty well. I've read that this is similar to the Alien set, but since I don't have that one I can't say for certain.    The films have never looked better on home video.  There may be a few issues here and there, but as opposed to freeze-framing through each spot where a change took place, I sat down and watched them, and had a blast doing it.     I have to admit I wasn't crazy about some of the changes I had heard about in the weeks up to the release. But they aren't as big of a deal to me when watching them in the context of the films.  For example, the new Krayt Dragon call that Obi-Wan makes in Episode IV sounded awful to me when I heard the clip online.  However, when I finally heard it in the context of the movie in DTS-HD sound, I really didn't mind it.     The sound is amazing.  When I first started watching, I felt that I wasn't hearing as much from my surrounds. Ambient sounds were there, but I finally realized it was the fact that everything was more precise, and I was only hearing the \\"punch\\" of the surrounds when I was truly supposed to.    There are a ton of extras and I haven't gotten through them all yet, but what I've seen is great.  Tons of things we haven't seen before, and some of the deleted scenes and animatics are things I actually would have liked to have seen added to the films.       Obviously there are those that changes matter a great deal to and I'm sure we all would have loved a branching option to select your owncustom cut (Crawl/No Crawl,Han does/doesn't shoot first,SE footage/no SE footage, etc.) but unfortunately that's not here.      I would encourage you to consider the set as a whole and not fault the whole over a couple of changes here and there, but if those mean that much to you, this review won't sway you anyway. But these are the best these films have ever looked and sounded and I would recommend them for any Star Wars fan.
0671027344|4|This book is one of the best I've ever read but I wouldn't reccomend it for any one who is nieve.  It pretty accurately depicts the feelings of some teens, but it also throws in some pretty heavy stuff.

1442341769|4|Dawkins book about scientific explanations for rainbows, possibility of life on other planets, and how the earth began. Not for religious folks who have &#34;supernatural&#34; types of explanations without data or puzzlement. Not about myths. Interesting ideas based on evolution and the big bang theory.

B00RVBY8KO|1|Too much time given to very little interesting comment.
B000SW4DXK|4|While the original 1947 movie is still the best...I believe this is the best remake, at least in my opinion.
B008Y73940|5|Saw the trailer and had to see the movie. Matthew McConaughey is superb in this role. A great supporting cast adds depth to the understated storyline that carries through the whole movie. It moves that a good plot line and fine acting all around can carry a movie without the next for wild special effects.
B004XDYJRU|2|No!. It was so nice and now it's green. Plus it isn't as easy to navigate. Updated key lime pie...
B005GY0Y8S|5|Can't believe how great Susan's novels are....loved book 2 .....&#34;Murder a la Carte&#34;. For the price they can't be beat. They are mysterious, not really detective stories and not really gruesome even though there is a murder factor.  I have paid bigger bucks for less so many times.....just one of those &#34;finds&#34; you love!

B001608QVS|5|I have been collecting everything Clint Eastwood for a while now--primarily because he has done a wide variety of movies, many of which I feel are underrated, but also because it's just fun to watch some of the sillier stuff.<br /><br />I already had all of these movies on DVD before I bought this set, and I was on the fence for a while, but I took the plunge and I am glad I did.  This would make a _great_ gift for the hardware fan of either Clint Eastwood or Dirty Harry specifically.<br /><br />The picture quality of _Dirty Harry_ didn't seem noticeably better on my 55\\" TV than the upconverted DVD, but the later movies seemed to benefit more and looked fantastic.  Of course, these don't look as incredible as the modern movies on Blu-Ray, but there's limitations of the original source material.<br /><br />The extra bonus materials come in both the commentaries and video features as well as some \\"toys\\" in the box--some copies of letters relating to the creation of these movies, and a booklet about the movies.  These extras definitely compensate for any lack of improved picture, whether real or imagined.<br /><br />If you don't have these movies already, you'll have to decide if it's worth the 50% premium for the Blu-Ray copies over DVD.  But if you're collecting up Clint Eastwood or have a particular affinity for these movies, definitely get this set.<br /><br />And if you're considering this as a gift for the Clint Eastwood fan in your life, I'd say you can't go wrong.
B007TBZ63Y|3|I hate the fact that these books ARENT PRIME!!!!!!!!!It is something he should CHANGE like RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!I have spent SO much on BOOKS i just cant afford to buy more right now.I luv everything else though.Good read.
B00E9ZAT4Y|5|watching it now
B004Z2TUGE|4|A well written sci-fi movie.  A normal high school boy, dealing with dating, love, high school, class bullies, parents and all other forms of teen-age drama; who just happens to be an alien with special powers!  A fun ride!!!!
B000002UJQ|5|To say you don't like this album out of spite is ridiculous. Even if you don't like the genre of music you can't deny that this album is if nothing less, very interesting musically and lyrically. It may not be completely original but that does not make it any less good.  <br />When I first purchased this album in 1997 I hated it, no joke. It took 10-15 listens before it started to grow on me. This is probably the experience of many who listened to this record. But of the thousands of albums I have listend to in their 'entierty' none have sounded sounded so good, or have captivated me as much as Ok Computer has in the past 7 years.  <br />pretentious, overated......come on, did you actually listen to the record? <br />Any music fan would agree that Radiohead did something special with OK computer, and although it may not be 'everyone's favorite record, it is nonetheless a damn good album deserving of a few listens!
B000007VCM|5|It's hard to classify a tough, rocking set of songs like the ones contained in \\"Love.\\"  For me, it just simply rocks!  And according to Mark Knopfler's Sultans of Swing, they rock in a non-trumpet manner.  I wouldn't call it goth or psychedelic, although elements of both are present.  More than anything, I think that an awesome melodic flow, that is at the same time, punched up by raw energy and vigor in the way that the instruments are played and the way Ian sings, is the glue that binds and also what makes this collection of songs stand out among many, many contemporaries, and current outfits.  I believe after \\"Love\\" the Cult veered more towards a crunchier heavy metal sound (some of which I have in my collection).  If you don't have \\"Love\\" in YOUR collection, please, what the fek are you doing?  Get off your duff, stop twiddling already and get it.  I promise you, it's one of the all-time greatest set of recorded rock songs ever.
B0019CSXAM|4|Nothing wrong with the quality of the set physically, exactly as one expects from a series DVD box these days. An enjoyable season, but that is less objective than the actual item condition.
B00OKYQZDI|5|Fun
B00BQPEIT2|3|I didn't see anything special about it except for the hot air balloon. I like the temple run 2 better

B00C7JFIRC|4|Very good
B000K7VHQE|5|GREAT movie!!!!! Thank you!
B000XUBFE2|5|This was a very surreal yet captivating read. It was interesting that the narrator (Death) could intertwine the innocence of youth and the horrors of Nazi Germany during WWII. I was surprised that this book was classified as a \\"children's/youth\\" book. A very dark book for such a classification....
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Awesome kept me interested loved it can't wait for 3 graphics are great. Great for the mind of the young and old.
B00DHKKN6Q|4|So far it is fun. I have enjoyed it. It is fast paced and would be easy for anyone to play.

B0089AD8IO|4|This season is an excellent Jumpstart to a fantastic new series. The storylines are great, among the best being Dalek, The Empty Child & The Doctor Dances, and the finale. Eccleston's doctor is short, precise, a little too non-compassionate, and at the same time(hee hee-time? Get it?) he has a soft spot for humanity.    SPOILERS! There is an easter egg on DVD 4, but to get to it you have to go to the set up link, but instead of pressing ok/play, go down one more time so that a little circle lights up orange. Press play, and you'll see what it is.
B00CATSONE|5|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  I was amazed by his inventions and how he was so overlooked in the history of this country.  I guess the same old story, money talks and bull walks.  Highly recommended!
B009FZHYKU|5|so far so good. just on 8 th of the season. They better not kill off Daryll I will be hot if they do.
B009XIXVU6|5|This is a must read.  I love historical fiction and this is one of the best epic, historical fiction novels I have come across.  The only negative is that I wish the novel would have continued.  There are so many riveting characters brilliantly intertwined by the author.  I could not put this book down.  I liked this better than &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;
B005OCFGTO|4|My granddaughter had this collection on her Christmas gift list last year and she was very happy to receive it.

B00L9B7IKE|5|Easy to get into and keep me until the twisting end.  At first had to go back and check the dates of each chapter, because they jumped around.  But it was great and I could not put it down.
B002MQYOFW|1|I loved the movie. I was unable to view the bood I purchased online on my Kindle Fire. I have called seven times since August 24, 2012, The reps I talked to all seemed competent, but when I did what they recommended nothing happened. I had over $125.00 worth of books on my kindle. They are all gone. At this point the only thing my kindle is good for is as a paperweight. I would love some assistance in this matter but I doubt I will get it.
B001N3GUIE|5|The Blu-ray DVD is an excellent reproduction of the original, visually stunning. The audio tracks by the Barrons sing out in pristine form.
0553274503|5|I read this for English last year. At first, I didn't understand what was going on in the book, but once it hit me....I was hooked. To see Charlie go from ... to genius was incredible. There was so much detail, so many hooks and catches....it was one of the best books I have ever read. However, I did cry at the end...how can you not? I 100% recommend this to any and everyone!
B00QW8TYWO|5|I think it is so fun and addicting
0007281196|5|I loved this book! The story line is easy to follow and brings tears laughter and joy. It also teaches some lessons in life as well. Highly recommend!

B0091REZMW|4|can be played without making purchases... just takes longer. hidden objects that move each time and good support from developers and other players.
B00BAXFAJC|5|It was a very long book but loved it. So many characters and stories, I thought I would get lost, but stayed right there until the end. I would recommend it to all my friends.

B00006FM77|5|I know there are lot of you who have issues involving the original mix/master of both the 1995 Chicago Records re-issue, as well as the original 1990 Columbia CD release, such as the \\"kazoo\\"-sounding horn section, in which this remaster cleans up.  <br /> <br />I chose the Chicago Records issue, along with their Group Portrait box set (sadly not reissued/remastered when Rhino picked up the Columbia/Chicago back catalog), and Chicago IX CDs from 1995 (as they all have the same signal level for consistant transfer to Sony MiniDisc), for the purpose of making an expanded version, a true anthology, of this legendary band in their \\"glory years\\" (1968-75, I-IX), in which I will include two tracks (\\"25 or 6 to 4\\", this live version absolutely smokes the studio cut from II, and \\"I'm A Man\\") from this ignored masterpiece as well as tracks from III and XIII (also ignored on Chicago IX) to add onto it.  <br /> <br />Note about the mix, especially the brass section, although that \\"kazoo\\" effect was cleaned up on this remaster, don't forget, this album was recorded in 1971 (yes, 1971!!!), and the legendary Carnegie Hall's acoustics were never conducive to electronic amplification, as one reviewer mentioned, but it is raw, first take, and the way a live album should be, not remixed beyond recognition to the point of it sounding TOO perfect, (although this remaster does improve the mix some bit) but instead one done with passion, heart, and something missing, especially in this day and age of \\"homogenized\\" live albums, which are mostly loaded with overdubbed tracks, \\"crowd noise\\" enhancements, and too-perfect-lip-synced vocals: integrity and respect for their loyal die-hard fans, the music business, and 100% effort in every note played and sung! It's not perfect but it is all real, with none of the enhancements!  <br /> <br />Most bands on today's \\"live\\" albums are simply going through the motions, and not really pouring out their heart and soul into making one, they just simply do it to make money, rather than do it for the fans, who they now resort to gouging out of $25.00 a ticket to see what winds up as garbage, and in agreement with one reviewer, this is the best of the 3 live sets Chicago has recorded. No matter what issue of this album you choose, original or remastered, if you are old-school as both a music fan as well as a musician like me, get this one! Highly recommended! <br /> <br />
B005ZOBNOI|5|This was such a pure story of heartache and love. This book gave me a new understanding of death and the loss of love. I feel like I'm a better person for having read this book!
B004GJDQT8|1|Doesn't work.  Pain to install through convoluted proprietary bs backdoor work around.  Amazon hates Android users.  Put your stupid apps on Google play!  This makes me hate amazon.  I know Google is your competition.  Sorry you didn't invent Android.  But if you want your customers to be able to use your product, you're going to need to put it in the Google play store for the vast majority of us who aren't venti laté, Starbucks sipping, Obama loving,  Apple homos.  If you want me to buy a fire phone and Amazon streaming device, i site as he'll won't now.  I'd rather just cancel Amazon altogether!
B00CWY76CC|5|I really enjoyed this game. I love puzzles and this an entertaining addition to my collection. These puzzles are challenging without being overly frustrating. Recommended!
B00AAQRNQ8|5|I have used this for several months now. Arma 3, BF3, Bioshock and many others!<br /><br />You simply cannot find another gaming mouse out there with this level of customization or quality.
B00QROI70S|5|This is a great movie. This is coming from someone who had no knowledge of the Guardians of the Galaxy prior to this movie. Well done and action packed.
B00IU0M85C|5|Excellent show!
B001ANSS5K|2|Very formulaic and uninteresting. I meet felt a connection to any of the characters and therefore didn't care what happened in this novel.
B00C7O8TSM|5|Just listened to this on a road trip and it brought back great memories of my childhood and also a Beach Boys concert 2 yrs ago. Love that Brian Wilson was on this 50th Anniversary Tour!
B002NZK5TG|5|For those who love musicals, you won't be disappointed.  This is a classic movie, with a little bit of dark humor.  Steve Martin's role as a dentist who loves to inflict pain is hilarious.  Great cast.  You will want to watch this movie over and over.
B00DUGCLY4|5|I have had this game for a very long time and I can say that it is REALLY good. I makes me feel smart when I get a hard one correct and it is really crealtive
B000002W9Q|5|Above all, (I've Had) The Time Of My Life is probably the best song ever made. (In my opinion.) This was the theme of our junior/senior prom and after that night, I went straight out and bought the album. The song really  means a lot to me since I graduate next year. A girl I've had a crush on  this year is leaving and I plan to play this for her after graduation. I  also plan to play it after my graduation. It just seems right, doesn't it?  Get down and boogie and have the time of YOUR life today!
6304698798|4|4.5 stars.  In so many words, this is a classic Western.  Anyone who loves Westerns does or will love this film.  The three main actors are all memorable, the story is engrossing, and Sergio Leon's direction is excellent.  The cinematography is superb, ranging from widescreen vistas baked under the Spanish sunshine to repellent close-ups of dirty bounty hunters and the like.  What I did not remember about this film is how incredibly huge it is!  Some of the location shots are extensive and a couple of the scenes encompass Civil War magnitude with thousands of extras(no CGI here, thank the Lord!).  Anyway, I could praise the film, the acting, and all that to no end...but this particular DVD package is fairly lame.  True, it is cheap, but the fact that the sound is only 2-channel is a big disappointment.  With only two of my five speakers blasting that most famous score had me a little deflated, to say the least. However, the picture quality is better than has been suggested, and there is a specail feature of 14 minutes of footage that was flitched off for the U.S. release of the film.  This film is very entertaining, and for the measely price they are asking for one could certainly do worse than this DVD.  Just be sure to wear headphones so you won't notice the 2-channel effect so much.  Take it easy.
B00GMFYX0A|5|Great to see the current and future conditions
B000066NW0|5|This CD, full of guitar driven tracks is one to listen to. Avril has a beautiful singing voice that I'd compare to Fiona and Alanis. Her songs are real.
B00HA8WNZ0|5|Another Amazon &#34;App of the Day&#34; download - I am a big fan of the puzzle and strategy genre, and this game is now one of my favorites to play: I couldn't put it down last night, totally traded my gym night to lay on my couch and play it! It starts off simple enough to give you an idea of the strategy, and then slowly progresses to more challenging levels, adding more shapes and manipulators to the board. I loved getting passed the first two levels and being rewarded with the next set of levels! I highly recommend giving this game a try if your into puzzle games, you might just give up your gym night too!
B009UX2YAC|5|This game had no lag, had lots of exclusive stuff, and there was very neat places on the world tour.I really really really love the game.I always play this game about 24/7. I think you should buy this game
B009ZZDNT6|5|Good app, but a little confusing to set up. If you use different time, you have to disable 24-hour time. To do this, go to your Kindle Option Menu (in the home bar) and tap settings. This is done in the app. UN-check the 24-hour time. Good app, though.
B0083P1QUM|4|I choose this rating because everyone of the Scarlett novels are great.<br />yes I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B009HUB40Y|5|I loved playing a game called Bejeweled and this is pretty close to the same thing, so am having a blast playing it.
B00FAVRFXE|5|I wish John Hurt had his own season, but I am really enjoying Capaldi
B0044DEAUA|4|very good, product- iam satisfied with the quality. reached in time- perfect packing also. keep up the good work. thanks
B0079KGAOY|4|The only set to get since the 4 Film Collection on Blu-ray has flawed video quality.  If you like cop films then get this set and be happy.  Would have been 5 star if they included the Director's Cuts as an option.  Does include all the scenes to view separately and a good documentary with Richard, Mel and Danny up 1st thing freezing outside.  Don't hire that director for documentaries.
B008K6HN8I|5|Very nice, it allows you access to files that normally I wouldn't know how to access through the kindle, especially past downloaded files. Would recommend to everyone.
B001G9F9IW|5|The dvd was a great price for a blu-ray! I enjoy watching this movie! It is a favorite of mine!
B001P575AM|5|Wonderful. Thank you...
B00KG2NGPS|3|The cast is great, but the writing is a disappointment; speech after speech with little about the actual art or why art matters.  don't &#34;tell&#34; us, show us!  and if you cannot, then perhaps rethink the premise?  the ending sequence was okay, but seriously? this was the best you could do with THAT cast? It didn't have to be oscar-winning, but it felt like a thirty minute show stretched to fill out a movie.
B0063M22QO|4|not to bad  play it most days.....You need to put more games on there it only goes up to 98 tiles
B008VBYN80|4|It's a great game and it's fun that you get to build your own kingdom. But the bad thing is that you have to sign into Facebook or Gameloft. Other than that it's a great way to spend your time.
B008Y7N7JW|5|A very action  packed movie. would recommend seeing this one. It continues where the first one left off.  Rent it.
B0032CVAQQ|5|Every couple must read this book, it's a must to have. Powerful statements. I have learnt a lot by reading this book. Lot will be changed in my life, even my wife will be surprise cause after reading this book l will never be the same again....
B00003JRCQ|5|This is probably my favorite Jane Austen movie and certainly my favorite version of Persuasion.  The acting brings out such stifled anxiety and tension that it still feels like a miracle when things work out in the end, even though I've seen it several times!
B005HJ6MRO|1|Can't edit docs from here and on kindle fire it won't open any, saying the file is no supported.
B00EEDJHXA|5|Who would have thought that buttons and scissors could be so much fun! It gets progressively harder and more challenging with each level. You need to mentally map your strategy before you start cutting and even then sometimes you may need to try again. The brain really does get a good workout.  And I love the sound of the scissors cutting the buttons! Ha!
0553386794|2|Good fantasy story wrapped in a vile presentation filled with frequent rapes and crimes against women, and glorifying violence for the violence-porn addicts out there. Not a book series for anyone who cannot stand rape, and cannot stand buckets-of-blood types of books.  I was given the book as a gift a few years ago for Christmas. The giver didn't know my intense dislike for books that include rape scenes, and crimes against women. I was a good ways into the book before I realized what kind of book it was. By that point, the very interesting story had me hooked enough to try to skip over and ignore the rapes and intense violence. By the end of the book, I had endured casual murder, incest, bestiality (the dragon stuff at the end), women treated like chattel, detailed violence scenes, and torture scenes.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, the story really is interesting, and you will want to know what happens next. George R.R. Martin has tapped into that primal well of human emotions where revenge lives, and has you turning pages to find out what happens next, hoping that soon you will see someone get some justice.  The story of John Snow being an unacknowledged (and hated) bastard in his own household, and how he deals with that, the power struggles, the political intrigue, the family loyalty, the betrayals, all of that is page turner stuff.<br /><br />However, I cannot get over the ultra-violence including the rapes.  I do not find such content entertaining in the least -- I find it horrifying. I now have a strict policy to stop reading any book that has any kind of rape scene. If rape is alluded to \\"off camera\\" and not described, and most certainly NOT glorified, then I will continue reading as long as the author doesn't make a habit of it (especially if the rapists are brought to justice).  I cannot skip over such things any more. It isn't entertainment, it is glorifying one of the worst things a human can do to another human, aside from murder, and I will not support any author doing it.<br /><br />If you are able to look past such things (and I do not fault you for it) and are able to enjoy the fiction as fiction without reading more into it. Then the book will probably be a 4 or 5 star book for you.  For myself, however, it was a 2 star book at best. I am only giving it the extra star, because of the strength of the rest of the story, discounting the rapes and ultra-violence.<br /><br />2 stars.upport any author doing it.<br /><br />If you are able to look past such things (and I do not fault you for it) and are able to enjoy the fiction as fiction without reading more into it.

0061353248|5|The author offers experiments as well as concepts to support a premise that makes sense.  This is well worth reading and an easy read at that.  But it doesn't hurt to be an economist with an MS in Psychology either.  You certainly get the jokes better.
B002N5N5LG|5|If you haven't watched this or if you are a fan and haven't purchased this, then you have to go out today and get this!  Best show EVER!
B001BANK32|5|This is one of my very favorite King novels. I've read The Shining probably over 10 times and each time not only does it scare the crap out of me, but I seem to enjoy it more than the previous reading and take more out of the story. I not only love it for the story itself, but because it takes place in my home state of Colorado starting in Boulder and then moving up into the Rockies. Sidewinder is a fictional town where the Overlook Hotel is located, but if you visit Estes Park, Colorado you will find The Stanley Hotel on Overlook Drive which is haunted as well ;-)<br />I just finished reading Doctor Sleep which is the follow up novel to The Shining and I am really happy to know where Danny and Wendy landed after the Overlook and Sidewinder.<br />The Shining is a superb and haunting tale and for those of you with a little 'shine' in ya, I know you'll connect with this book that same way I did.<br />Enjoy it!!
B000001FTA|5|Message to Pitchulo and cd-heaven (see more about me) from Poontang Heaven. Brian Robertson played lead on opium trail and killer without a cause.<BR>Message to A music fan from Silver Spring, Maryland USA. Phil Lynott died of a drugs overdose.
B0055OK2T0|4|I liked the characters, their on-screen chemistry was so palpable that it got me thinking if they in their own lives wanted to change their courses by using free-will to be together and leave their own married partners. The storyline could've been beefed up more. I felt that when the main character was told that by not being with Elise, she wouldn't be a famous choreographer but instead would be teaching \\"6 year olds to dance\\"...is that really enough to say, \\"Okay, gosh, I really must leave her.  She's destined for a life of pain\\"...I would've point-blank asked her...What was more important to her, our love or her career.  I think we all know what the answer would've been and we would have saved about 7-10 minutes of the movie while he blows her off at the hospital, etc...Even with my quips about this, this movie inspires.  It inspires me to embrace my free will even more and make sure that everyone knows they can exert it to maneuver thru life experiences they want to change.  Hope you enjoy the movie!
0062255657|5|I adore this book. It is beautifully written! The mark of a wonderful read...I finished it and felt like I wanted to read it immediately again. The best word I can use to describe it is &#34;lush&#34;. His word painting makes the reading experience almost feel tactile.
1780674880|5|Bought this after hearing the story on NPR.  The art work is beautiful and intricate.  Although I am way past my 4th decade, I love coloring. It is meditative and calming for me.  Her first book is sold out, but I am excitedly waiting for it to be re-issued.
B00HV2KPNW|5|One of the best movies from Disney in recent years. Our whole family loves it. We've already watched it two more times since purchasing it.
B009FZHYKU|5|Stupendous!! Story line is always interesting and easy to follow. Characters and actors are always believable and very talented. Thank you for making this series addictive. Thought provoking, scary, but never over the top.
B000002J1B|4|This album is just mind-blowing, for the most part. For me the climax of Gates is not Soon but Patrick's and Steve's soloing before it. Stunning. And Sound Chaser is crazier than it sounds, you'll love it. To Be Over, well, I suppose it's placed well after the chaos. Alan's drumming is truly horrid on the first half of the song though, it totally ruins what could have been a Yes classic.<br />Get it, for me it's the last great Yes album before Magnification (for all you Moody Blues fans this is a comeback album, not the boring piffle they call Strange Times).
B002ZG980U|5|This movie is destined to be a CLASSIC.  At the Oscars it seemed to be largely overlooked and was nominated only for special effects and the like.  I can only assume that the movie was too cerebral for the Academy, and that they just plain didn't understand it.  Too bad.  It has an excellent script, but you can't afford to not pay constant attention.  Special effects, cinematography, set designs and the like were excellent, but so were the acting and directing. This is one of those rare movies where all violence and special effects were an integral part of the story; they weren't just \\"thrown in\\".  I saw the movie three times in the theater; buying the DVD was a must. A must buy.
0374533555|5|I am only on chapter three but I love this book!
B00ADQCBEY|5|Someone recommended that I watch this.  In some ways it is like the wire but this was made before the wire came out.  I'm continuing the watch the series and very happy someone recommended it.  The acting is very good, good character development and all around good series so far.<br />I can't say that I like it better than the wire but it is definitely up there.
B000YMFCS4|5|This movie is by far one of the best love stories ever! Rachel McAdams is amazing... The whole movie is just phenomenal!!!
B0000TB03W|5|If you caught and enjoyed the live show on NBC, this DVD is an absolute must have.  All the best parts of the show along with the behind the scenes snippets and interviews are all there.  The show was awesome so, if you missed it on TV, this an ideal opportunity to catch it and, better yet, own it!
B003UBTX6S|5|Just couldn't stop. Gripping story that reaches all emotions. Surprises that truly surprised !!!on to book 3 tonight! Thank you
B00DYOOGYK|2|It's kind of annoying but this happens to  spontaneity games on my KF HD<br />and I'd really like to play this please help.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Fun and very cool setting.  It's relaxing to play but keeps you on your toes too.  Will probably play it more than candy crush.

B001NHNG64|4|I'm new to lee child and his hero Jack Reacher...I'm so glad the Amazon ad caught my eye cuz now I'm hooked!!  Just like Lucas Davenport,  Harry Bosch, Eve Dallas and Kay Scarpetta, Jack Reacher has quickly become a favorite...
B0085FF55W|5|This is great music; even an old retired hippie can like a new sound when it's got so many elements of old sounds.  I've listened to this a dozen or more times and still find almost every track enjoyable.  I'd love to say that the guitar reminded me Clapton, the drums like Baker or the harmonies of Yes... but that's not the case.  It's not the outstanding components that make this good, its the composition of the whole.  The music just melds together and produces a very nice sound.  Oh well, I never distinguish cherry or vanilla hints in my wine, I just open a bottle and know when it tastes good.  Loma Vista tastes good.
0735619670|5|read like a novel.
0061547832|5|What an inspiring book... it really got me to think about how the real life business world actually is.. and as for the seller.. great shipping time and great condition of the product A+
B003QTBT5C|5|It was exactly as i expected. though there was a lot more songs with vocals then there last couple cds. It was great nonetheless.
0743457900|4|In the end, a great story with compelling characters. The beginning is quite slow, or maybe it took me some time to get used to the pace. The plot lines and cast of characters are complex. The first time I started reading it, I kept forgetting who was who between sittings, and quickly lost my motivation to continue. But then I started again, this time with a notebook handy to write down character names and bits of jargon. With that small aid during the first third or so of the book, I was swept up in the story; I don't think I looked at the notebook once during the second half of the book. And I am very glad I persevered! The characters are so well drawn, the emotions so repressed, the action so understated... It's really quite a remarkable book. I look forward to reading the rest of the Karla trilogy.
1439156816|5|Honestly, I was not expecting much from this book. I had assumed it would be another drab &#34;how to&#34; from a successful writer. Wow, was I wrong!! Instead, it was not only a terrific insight into the writing process, but also a wonderful look into the life of a great writer. King may not be held up with the greats of literature. However, no one can argue that he isn't doing something right. &#34;Popular&#34; doesn't mean bad. Instead, it means that he has managed to strike a chord with millions of satisfied readers.
B006VY0SEM|5|Soko is amazing.... Bluntly... Beautifully honest. The album is one of the sweetest  most humble work I have heard in tears. Arrived súper fast. Must buy!
B001U0HBPG|5|One of the best movies I've seen in the last ten years. I'm a fan of movies from the 1930s and '40s much more than I am of current movies. Benjamin Button is the type of story that could have been made in that golden era of Hollywood, but with much better special effects. The movie haunted me for days after my first viewing and I had to watch it a few more times to absorb some of the small details that make the movie a lot more fun.    I've recommended it to everyone I know who likes well-made, quality movies with good story lines.
B0052RDHTM|5|This was so good! Couldn't put it down. I loved learning about history. And although so much hurt and tragicties
B00EOARZ4G|5|This is the first Tom Clancy I've read.I can't compare it to others but it reads really well.Just pay attention because the story jumps back and forth.I would read another.Hopefully this series continues.
B00GD9F59S|5|Great book  . I think it was the best one good ending .very happy with it. Everyone get a happy ending
B000002KNI|5|This sound,rhythm and melodies are great. Simon and Garfunkel's performance is magnificent. I had difficulties to have a copy of this album (LP) in early 1982. I found it and got a cassette record. They influenced  to my musical point of view during my university education. Unfortunately  they are not together. But, I think the next generation must listen them.  It will show something different!
B005LAIGLE|2|Disappointing because my favorite actor wasn't portraying the 'good guy'. I loved 'The Shooter' and wanted all his old movies to portray that hero guy I liked.
B00DR0PDNE|5|If my Xfinity wireless internet wasn't so fickle, this option is great, especially because you can use your phone. I use a wired connection if my internet isn't steady.
B00499NHLC|5|Cumberbatch and his watson make an amazing pair in this series.  The production values are movie quality, the scripts are all well written and the number of specials are so few it will make you beg some studio to pay them millions to do a legitimate series.
B0018CENUC|5|This is a great album for anyone who is a Toby Keith Fan.  It is also an album to buy if you want to sample Toby's various styles.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a music fan.
1484710800|5|Neat little book! :)
0316172324|2|Blink is disappointing.<br /><br />The theme is good. The value of snap judgments and thin-slicing is useful. And enjoyable. And entertaining.<br /><br />So what is wrong?<br /><br />Well, Gladwell says it all in the first 5 pages. The rest of the book is examples, and more examples and many more examples.<br /><br />He should have realized that we will 'get it' in a blink. And then left us alone. Except for the beginning, the book is probabaly aimed at satisfying the minimum word count for publication.<br /><br />Just read the reviews and summaries. The book has nothing to add.
B008JFUMDS|5|Loved Now You See Me!!  Bravo Ed Solomon for really good writing and a clever story!!  Superb cast and acting and a very fun time at the show!!

B00475AYJQ|5|First book was really good, but this one is amazing ! A great collection of different events that takes the reader to a diversified world, rich with cultures, races, stories and people. This is a book that not only entertain you,but that also seeks to show you a whole new world. In this sense, it is one of the best out there for fans of escapism. For the entirety of the thousand pages, my attention never faltered. Can't wait for the third book.

B003UYV08E|2|\\"Iron Man 2\\" could have been a great movie.  This is the frustrating fact of the mostly-failed effort of \\"Iron Man 2.\\"  It is not a complete loss, but it is dying of a cancer, a malaise if you will.  It suffers from a malaise that is seeping all over Hollywood over any good franchise.  We all have seen this malaise, felt its effects and lamented its continued presence.  It has brought down titans and peons in the movie industry alike.  The problem is, it is insidious, tempting and truly the devil's fare.  It has gone by many names, but I dub it \\"Sequalitis.\\"  Sequalitis infects any movie that has even the potential to become a franchise.  It has been there since day 1 and will be with us till the day we die since studio executives rate somewhere between dimwits and rutabegas on the intelligence meters. We have been warned since childhood with fables such as the golden goose to stay away, but studio executives must try to kill all that is good in the universe.  They are not responsible for innovation, but they sure can kill it.    Okay, so what is sequalitis, you may ask?  Simple.  It is the mistaken notion that the next installment of a successful movie must have everything the first one did and more.  It must be bigger, more thrills, more chills, more stars and more oomph.  The notion of trying to recreate a formula that worked so well, usually because it was so unique.  Once that uniqueness is attempted again, though, it is no longer unique and therefore loses its magic.  And we can place the blame squarely in the stupid studio executives' grubby little hands.  It is greed unboound.  It is the triumph of commerce over art.  It is...some other metaphor for Goliath beating David.  Movies cost SO much to make anymore, between special effects cost, marketing, talent and executive avarice, union rates and a whole host of other costs that go into the production of a high-profile movie.  Combine that with the slavish devotion to the pre-release focus group feedback and the studios all but strip out any kind of magic or originality into a production until we are left with a bland, flaccid and vanilla avatar of what could have once been something interesting and, yes, fun.    This is the problem with \\"Iron Man 2.\\"    \\"Iron Man 2\\" has approximately 6 good movies in it.  If the producers would have picked 2, they would have had a great movie.  I loved Stark's alcholism, losing his company, a rival nipping at his heels, his assistant taking over, his friend starting a new Iron Man, a wronged villain enacting revenge, a government agent spying on him, a new covert government agency working at cross purposes with him and ---gasp!--- the Avengers initiative.  All of these are interesting plotlines.  But because fanboys want to see War Machine or Black Widow or Whiplash or whatever, the producers tried to put in everything while doing justice to nothing.  It becomes a ham-handed attempt to make a tentpole movie delivered with all the subtlety and finesse of a sledgehammer to the side of the head.  Add to that a stupid, cartoon villain (the rival contractor), frenetic MTV-style editing that ensures you can't figure out what just happened, never mind what will happen, and a story-telling device that makes you think you dropped into a 10-episode show at the 3rd for 4th show.  The executives forgot what made the original \\"Iron Man\\" so good, which was about a very flawed man who has a life-changing experience and tries to make good on his past sins.  The iron suit is merely incidental.  The STORY is what is important here, not the trappings.  \\"Iron Man\\" is fantastic until the last 20 minutes when it becomes the battle of the iron men.  This sequalitis makes me cringe for what is in store with the upcoming \\"Avengers\\" movie next year.  When they throw all of these last 5 or 6 movies into the soup, I fear we will get a confused mess, not a worthy story-line.  Bottom-line, don't think too much about \\"Iron Man 2.\\"  It is like a Victoria's Secret model.  It looks beautiful, but in the end is vapid and devoid of any depth or intelligence.  You want to look, you will have a good time.  You want anything deeper, stand in line just like everybody else and lament the \\"pretty but dumbness\\" of the movie.  It is all sound and thunder, but no rain.  Nothing substantial.  But really awesome to look at.
B004HI84NG|5|Ok
B0089EHWQE|5|I have to agree with other reviewers that the ending is predictable, but that said, the author handles a delicate subject in a humorous and thoughtful manner.  It is a book that will keep you thinking long after you finish reading it.
B003UESJFG|5|A great family dvd, it will be enjoyed many times over.<br />Excellent product with excellent price.<br />Thank you for such a wonderful item.
B001XVCYH2|5|Love the storyline if the matrix and the visual effects are simply amazing ! Great action/ scifi film with a message.
B00HY7YXIM|5|I loved White Queen! The Downton Abby of the 14th Century.
B00NOPQU2K|5|Great. Breathtaking. You are interested from the start to the very end!
B00DGNO3WE|4|For those who love classical music and Maggie Smith, this is a great movie. The plot is a little weak.
B007MNV5WU|5|this game is one of the best games ever! it cost alot but worth it. i have been a fan of angrybirds for a long time and can say this is the best one yet
B00CT2P6VA|5|I loved Quell I and II. This version is even better. I can do it over and over and enjoy it every time.
B0076DCT2G|3|I'm a huge Demille fan. Especially the John Corey series. I found this book a disappointment. I usually like the dry humor of the character, but found it to be aserbic in this book, not really witty. Also, I found much of the dialogue to be very repetitive. Not much action, and a not very intimidating villain. I almost felt like the whole book was just a setup for yet another book.
B00ISJSK7K|4|You know, I love  the Hobbit series and The Desolation of Smaug was no different. Lots of action, great effects, but it's like it ended in the middle and left me hanging, bummer!  I'll look forward to The Continuation of Smaug.
B00GTZJLAK|5|EVERYONE LOVES THIS MOVIE & ID RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY AGE ..100% FABULOUSLY DONE ..COMPASSION & WIT & MORE ..
B003BWNC5E|1|This item did not work for my project.  Construction was poor. No installation instructions were provided<br />I would not recommend this item
B00F4PM6WG|5|My two-year-old granddaughter enjoys this game.
B0061US58C|4|Not quite as good as the first. Good but more attention paid to the plot on this one and my son wasn't as interested.
B007J4T2G8|1|I frikkin' HATED this book. Didn't like it enough to move on to books 2 and 3. BARELY finished book one. Finished it, because I don't like NOT finishing something I have started. Plus, I have heard so much HYPE about this book, I kept reading to see if I was missing something! Nope! Got to the end and was EXTREMELY disappointed!!! I think this book is for &#34;desperate housewives!&#34; LITERALLY!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5|So I am a student in 8th grade and are school got macbook air's and I have this on it and phone its nice for notetaking

0790729628|5|`Blade Runner', directed by Ridley Scott and starring, in one of his most important roles, Harrison Ford, is quite probably one of the best science fiction movies ever. I would easily put it in the top five with Fritz Lang's `Metropolis', Forbidden Planet', `2001 A Space Odyssey', and another Phillip K. Dick inspired story, `Minority Report'.<br /><br />I was originally disappointed with this movie when I saw it in the theatre, as it was based on one of Dick's most famous stories, `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and the screenwriters took significant liberties with the story. But one of the surest ways of identifying a high quality movie is when it `grows' on you after repeated viewings. I have probably seen the original theatrical release on VCR and DVD and on broadcast TV at least five times, and I look forward to every viewing. The things which grow in my appreciation of the film as time goes by are Ford's performance and Ridley Scott's great invention of a very dark Los Angles some fifty years (from the time of the filming) in the future. The dark settings are a Ridley Scott trademark and they show up most dramaticly in `Alien', `G.I.Jane', and `Black Sun'. While the effect is great in the Sci-fi and Horror flicks, it really doesn't work in `G.I.Jane', but that's another movie.<br /><br />`Blade Runner' seems to have embedded itself into our collective unconsciousness. I happened to see an Alton Brown / Food Network special on TV yesterday where our golden boy, AB quoted a line from Sebastian's geneticly engineered minatures in `Blade Runner'.<br /><br />This movie seems to be the sort of work where everything just seems to hang together very, very well, from the set design to the music to the acting. Virtually all the roles in the movie are small compared to Ford's character, the Blade Runner, Deckard, but there are some which make one wish they had larger parts. Joe Turkel fits his part perfectly as the founder of the Tyrell Corporation. M. Emmet Walsh is also perfectly cast as Deckard's former captain of the Blade Runner unit who calls him back into service. Sean Young does well as Tyrell's closet replicant. The greatest little pleasure outside Ford's role is the performance of William Peterson, much better known as the Larry of the three brothers, Larry, Darryl, and Darryl on the `Newhart' TV show. Brion James, a lesser character actor similarly carries his part well. The two most difficult parts to assess are those by Rutger Hauer and Edward James Olmos. I suspect Olmos is given a major visibility in the credits for this movie more due to his widely recognized part in `Miami Vice' than to his role in this movie itself. Regarding Hauer, I often thought this was by far his best performance and that his whole career is based on the recognition he got from doing this movie. But, having recently seen `The Hitcher' again, I sense that while Hauer does well in these very sinister roles, his acting range is really limited and, like Whoopie Goldberg in `Ghost', the acclaim should go not to the actor but to the casting director.<br /><br />Oddly, I suspect one of the biggest differences between the theatrical release and the director's cut is to make just a little more of Olmos' role in the movie. The theatrical release doesn't even add any lines for Olmos, just a few more for Ford / Deckard to explain Olmos' character. In general, the theatrical release added just a little more voiceover dialogue to explain things early in the movie and to give the ending a slightly more upbeat resolution.<br /><br />I was really disappointed with the extras on these DVDs, as missing is my favorite feature, a voiceover commentary by director which explains the scenes in the movie. I suspect that unlike Kevin Smith's movies which make more money in DVD release than in the theatre (and who therefore puts a lot of effort into DVD extras) `Blade Runner' is so good, the DVD producers feel no need to pile on the goodies.<br /><br />This is atruly great movie whose value increases as time goes by and other filmmakers are unable to top it's story and great atmospheric interpretation of a classic Sci-Fi hypothesis./>This is a truly great movie whose value increases as time goes by and other filmmakers are unable to top it's story and great atmospheric interpretation of a classic Sci-Fi hypothesis. <br />
B00PTB7B34|4|Seems good so far
0060899220|5|Have read this before and absolutely loved it.  Recently, I told my son-in-law about it and he seemed interested.  I decided to order it for him to read... then I decided that I would like to read it again, so I bought two copies.  Enjoying the book just as much reading it the second time!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is very addictive, but is very hard!! My high score is only 4. Greta for a ages. Yea
B005IQZB14|5|Very interesting book. Really held my attention. Made me want to go on a backpacking adventure myself (tho not on the PCT)!
B00F8GYC1Y|5|read the reviews... had to try the game... tried the game... love it... the reviews are real and great...!! worth the money!!
B000OLGCI4|5|This is my favorite Disney movie, and the only one I own. Jungle Book is a fun, timeless story with fantastic songs that stay in your head for days. It's truly enjoyable for both kids and adults. They don't make them like this any more!
B008AK8FHM|3|While I am sure the author is convinced of the actual physical experience, it still doesn't explain how he could recall it if his brain was totally non-functioning.  I would like to see interviews of non english-speaking NDE's from different cultures.  I really am curious as to how Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, et al, resolve the dogma and territorial issues, and whether God answers to different names when addressed by those of different culture!  So much we don't know and so much to learn!

B0009VRHLK|2|David Lean once said, describing the scene in Laurence of Arabia where Peter O'Toole rides from the distance towards the viewer that the producers lost their nerve and cut the unblinking shot down by a minute, that the longer version was \\"better\\". In a similar vein, the much maligned scenes looking through a van windscreen in The Brown Bunny, are weakened only by being cut short. This is because the impact of the fleeting human contact between driving is heightened by the endless hypnotic quality of driving. This is the real feeling of driving around: time ceases to be a factor when you are not trying to be somewhere but just keep moving towards a continuously receding point on the horizon. There is a cultural factor here as well: we are familiar with a roadside America via any number of road movies, pop videos (U2 spring to mind) and novels (Lolita is far more absorbing in its descriptions of mid 20th Century motel life than the workings of a paediphile's mind). But spectacular scenery, slick cuts, special effects, draining or saturating colour all romanticize the sheer dullness of travel. By contrast Brown Bunny plays on the familiarity to convey an ordinariness which is entirely lost in films which try to grind out the metaphor of personal emptiness by picking unusually bleak settings. <br /> <br />The people too are ordinary which makes the ultimately revealed back story all the more shocking even though, it is also ordinary in its way. This leaves the message \\"there but for the grace of god\\" all the more indelibly imprinted on the memory. I find it difficult to connect emotionally with characters who show no emotions but Bud shows exactly the kind of pain, indecision and yearning which go straight to the heart of loss. <br /> <br />The other obvious charge levelled at this film is that the fellatio scene is gratuitous. This is a moot point. This is a normal sexual act filmed without any kind of exaggeration; it is dealt with in exactly the same cinematic manneras talking, kissing or driving. If doesn't stand out or jar against the flow of the film. Showing a couple about to copulate and then playing music and cutting to extreme closeups of sweat droplets - that is gratuitous. Moreover it carries the story forward. What most people seem to miss is that this is not pornography in the sense of watching sex to masturbate - this is watching the sexual fantasy of someone masturbating. Sexual fantasies are not coy. This is made all the more evident by the lack of any other nudity or sexual activity up to that point - many European films lose the impact of sex by over-abbundance of nudity (maybe a sign of my Anglosaxon uptight attitudes).  <br /> <br />This is the ultimate guilt trip: on the surface Bud is looking for redemption but at the same time he has the same physical desires as any man, the same desires that caused all the trouble in the first place.

B00BSBR9N6|5|I enjoyed this book very much; I found it hard to put down and finished it in 2 days.  Don is like the Australian version of Sheldon Cooper.  I found myself laughing out loud several times while reading.  Going to see if the author has anything else I can read!
B00B2V66VS|4|I Really enjoyed this game.I played every day.I recommend it to everyone to buy from Amazon is free and most importantly is fun to play anytime
B0001V6ZJ8|5|Although it's difficult to capture any biographical film to the most intrinsic detail, this film does provide a well-developed storyline. I can listen to Jose ferrer's melodic voice forever! He was an excellent actor and a very believable Lautrec. The scenery is authentic and beautiful. The artwork presented in the film really gives a complimentary example of Lautrec's outstanding imagination. Other major stars, like Zsa Zsa Gabor are enchanting to watch! I loved her costumes! Highly entertaining film!

B009NY43NY|1|*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />I have read so many of the reviews that have been posted and I completely understand where people are coming from.<br /><br />I have been a fan of these books since she started writing them. I've followed them all since book one. Spent my hard earned money on these books and the little spare time I have consumed by these books. What did I get in return you ask. Well, I got a slap in the face.<br /><br />In the beginning the books and characters were phenomenal! I couldn't read them fast enough, then about the time that HBO got their claws in the rights to the characters the books started going downhill. Its almost like Harris saw what HBO was doing with her characters and she either got bummed out that she didn't think of it first, or she feared that her fans would like the HBO characters better so she just decided to stop trying. This is the first time Harris blatantly disrespects her fans and followers.<br /><br />I was seeing red when Harris completely emasculated Eric. The fans love ERIC. I'm sorry but let's be honest... we read your books for ERIC, because it sure isn't you creative writing abilities. I would say a good 85% of your fans are fans of  ERIC or ERIC & SOOKIE. Why oh why would you cut him out in such a horrendous way. Eric just walked away from Sookie like she never meant anything to him. He didn't fight for her or fight for what they had. Instead he simply walked away. That's so not like him. If you're going to write him out of her life you need to at least do it in such a way that it's in line with Eric's character. You spent so many books building up to his relationship with Sookie and showing the readers that he really did love her and then he was written off in the contents of a couple of pages.<br /><br />In addition to that Harris spent the previous 12 books showing that Sookie and Sam were just good friends and nothing more. There was example after example where they would have a quasi intimate moment and then Sookie or Sam would bring up that they are just really good friends and they don't want to ruin the friendship. Then suddenly Sam can't hold back how he REALLY feels about Sookie and she couldn't wait to jump in the sack with him. Harris made their feelings towards each other appear as quickly as she made Eric disappear. It felt forced or rushed. Another reviewer said it perfectly when she said \\"Harris had to shoehorn Sam into the happily ever after\\".<br /><br />The other big thing that really bothered me about this book was that its the final book in a series about VAMPIRES, and with the exception of a couple scenes involving Eric/Pam/Karin and a couple scenes involving Bill there are NO VAMPIRES in this book! The majority of this book is about the demons, werewolves, and shifters. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!?!?!<br /><br />The way I pretty much look at this book is that Harris took her characters and did whatever she wanted with them regardless of how her fans/followers would feel about it. She pretty much walked out of our lives and chucked us the bird on the way out the door. Thanks Ms. Harris now I really know what you think about your fans. I will never read another one of your books again.kie or Sam would bring up that they are just really good friends and they don't want to ruin the friendship.

While Barbra's voice may not be what it was in her 20's, it is still one of the finest in humanity ever.

B005G4TJI4|3|This is not a movie review.  If you are reading this by now you have already decided whether or not you like this movie.  I am here to write about the product.  In short, I liked the movie but, I didn't like this product.  All that it provides is the move in three different formats; Blu-ray, DVD and download.  The weakness is that that's it.  No extras, no deleted scenes, making-ofs, or interviews just the movie.  The movie looks good in 1080p which does it good service but, at the end I felt a little jipped when I find out that's all I got.  At $20 you get what you paid for but, if you are waiting for the full home viewing experience I'd hold off on this buy and wait for the full set.
B001BR5NH6|5|Loved it!
B002QE3CTY|1|A good science fiction plot but the characters could not be real.  I could not relate to the descriptions of their emotions.  No one I know of or ever heard of has emotion levels like the central figure..  I gave up after 80 %.  Waste of money at any price except for the plot.
B005ZOBNOI|1|I didn't finish reading this book.  Couldn't get interested in it.
B005KPDAN4|5|All the superlatives you may have heard of this show are accurate.  It is irreverent, sardonic, witty, sad, and on and on.  Truly a fine TV experience.
0767840135|5|Wonderful
B004XUMPFQ|5|Never seen a science fiction TV series so well done. I love how all the characters have a uniqueness and story of their own. Each episode brings something fresh and exciting. I just wished it continued longer.

B00CHSPB8Y|1|take of too much of the memory and power to play... really needs a better format also. that is all I can say about it.
B007J4T2G8|5|Yes I know everyone was gaga over the sex and yes I found it to be shocking and just wow, but their was more to the story and the characters.  I could not put the books down, I finished the first book in a day and the second book in two days and the third I slowed down because I did not want the story to end.  Very easy read and i enjoyed getting lost in the story.
B00N1ZCGWG|3|More of the same.....
B00TU9UO1W|1|Slow, boring, plodding movie.  Even ignoring the massive amount of &#34;bad physics&#34; in this movie, it simply was NOT good sci-fi.<br /><br />Compared to a brilliant Kubrick film like &#34;2001&#34;, this fiasco of a movie can't hold up.  I really don't understand all the 5-star reviews that call this Nolan movie &#34;brilliant&#34;.  It wasn't.  It's a movie that will be quickly forgotten and soon appear in the 99-cent DVD bin at your local Dollar Store.  I was hoping for so much more but this movie fails to deliver at almost every level.  In a word.... yuck !
B005DJREJS|4|about young adults but very adult like themes and situations..best for 17 and older..some of the stories ans situations are pretty predictable, but it is done well enough that it is still enjoyable to watch. Once i get through the whole season I can write a better review..

B009329ZF2|1|Maybe if this movie came out during the 90's it would have been big. Rihanna made this movie even worse off than it already was. Not all the star power could save this one. maybe if they let the aliens win, it would have been good
B00004T0US|3|It goes without saying that in the legacy of rock music, Elvis is among the most important, and that most important in this case does not mean most consistent.  When treating Elvis' catalog for remastering, I can see why RCA would not consider it practical to take Sony's approach and remaster every LP Elvis released as a single album, single disc release.  On the other hand, the sloppy treatment rendered on Elvis' catalog is unforgivable, no matter how wildly varied these albums are.  There are still dozens, if not hundreds, of throwaway compilations on the market, and now to further the problem, RCA is screwing with Elvis' original albums.  The sequencing and tracklist of ON STAGE for instance, is a remastering of the original album with bonus tracks interspersed, and a medley replacing the original version of a song - and is for all intents and purposes a new CD.  What RCA has done to MOODY BLUE amounts to the same damage.    MOODY BLUE isn't a masterpiece, and its history among Elvis fans is very divisble - but in its original form it was a really good record, featuring some excellent performances.  The original album was made up of 3 tour tracks, 6 Graceland sessions, and a live cut from his 1974 live in Memphis album.  \\"Unchained Melody\\" is a more theatrical cut than a straight performance, but Elvis handles the song well.  His two Olivia Newton-John covers \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\" and 1974 \\"Let Me Be There\\" are well-done.  While some reviewers have noted the songs sound alike, that was why they worked as hits for Olivia as \\"If You Love Me\\" followed \\"Let Me Be There\\" up the charts; both written by John Rostill and have a similar style.  Both are good songs, in particular I like Elvis' loose take on \\"If You Love Me (Let Me Know)\\".  \\"Little Darlin'\\" isn't much of a performance though.  The Graceland sessions include two excellent country classics \\"He'll Have To Go\\" (Jim Reeves) and \\"She Thinks I Still Care\\" (George Jones), in particular \\"She Thinks I StillCare\\" is a standout.  The title track was Elvis' last #1, topped the country charts, and is a favorite, though one can detect a slight disco flavoring to the song.  \\"Way Down\\" was a smart uptempo rock song, and the cover of \\"Pledging My Love\\" is beautiful.  Though Elvis didn't intend it \\"It's Easy For You\\" was a beautifully sad note to close his last album.    Given that MOODY BLUE was my first Elvis record (child of the 1980s) I am especially fond of it, which makes RCAs remastering decisions even more atrocious.  Whether or not the record is patchwork, which it is, there's a certain historical/artistic sense that is lost by the reckless tampering with the album's content.  For this edition, RCA cut \\"Let Me Be There\\" which closed side one, and added the entirety of FROM ELVIS PRESLEY BOULEVARD IN MEMPHIS after \\"It's Easy For You,\\" which damages the effect.  While there are some good songs on that album, \\"For The Heart,\\" \\"Hurt,\\" \\"The Last Farewell,\\" it neither works well with MOODY BLUE, nor does it make any sense to tag another album on as \\"Bonus Tracks.\\"    This may be a purists' review, but RCA does Elvis fans a disservice by reorganizing a catalog that has stood for over thirty years.  Its time for the label to show some artistic respect for Elvis' recorded achievements, aside from the hits.  Why not remaster these albums (completely) and sell two-as-ones, keep them intact and identified as different albums.  Rather than a revamped ON STAGE offer LIVE FROM THE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL and the original ON STAGE.  Offer BACK IN MEMPHIS alongside FROM ELVIS IN MEMPHIS.  Rather than restructure the MOODY BLUE album and attempt to pass off a different record as bonus tracks, fix the errors (the missing \\"Let Me Be There\\") and sell them as one set.  This allows fans to appropriately build their Elvis libraries, and treats his catalog with some measure of respect.

0439023513|5|After finishing a book, I always like to go see the reviews of it. Reviews don't make much sense beforehand until you read the book. Let me just say this about all the negative reviews of this book...    They absolutely shocked me.    In my opinion a good book, or a book series for that matter, prevents you from putting it down. When you finish one book, you MUST read the next one immediately or your mind just races. And when your done, its leaves with a feeling  of longing and elation - you want more.    With these books, I read them all in 4 days, the last two in a day each... I couldn't put them down, and when I was done, I had to reflect on them, as I still am.    Every negative review appears to revolve around missed expectations, people expected one thing to happen, the book to end a certain way, or the character arcs to proceed in a certain typical manner.    I don't consider predictable plots enjoyable, nor do I create expectations before I read a book. All I know is that I could not put this book down, every moment was riveting, the plot twists were unpredictable, and my mind never stopped racing.    The key point -  I enjoyed this book as a whole, so It gets 5 stars. If I spend the money, I should enjoy it right? I Highly recommend this book.
1455523550|3|As I started reading this book called Safe Haven, the movie  Sleeping with the Enemy with Julia Roberts and Patrick Bergin came to my mind. Nicholas Sparks re-wrote this idea in his own way and I did enjoy his turn of events to this old idea.  This is something different than what he usually writes and not to make a spoiler but I am not sure I like the supernatural part of the book.  Thank you Nicholas Sparks for a good read.<br />Marie Fostino author of The Silver Locket

B000063DI9|4|Some people claim that \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" (1988) shows Iron Maiden at their creative peak. To me, these kinds of comments have very little bearing because this album is very similar to many others regarding the material. Still, the opening track, \\"Moonchild\\" is one of the bands finer efforts and there are of course some moments here and there when Steve Harris and Co shine musically. <br />The previous album \\"Somewhere in time\\" was criticized for its use of guitar synths and some fans thought it lacked power, that it was a light metal album. But \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" has a couple of lighter numbers as well, and  \\"Can I play with madness\\" is perhaps Maiden's most commercialized track ever. \\"The evil that men do\\" is a rather easy listening track with Harris' galloping bass lines that has become a sort of trade mark, and \\"Infinite dreams\\" is a pleasant song with the characteristic changes in tempo and beat. The title track is an epic one, almost 10 minutes long, and it follow the same structure of many others, both previously and to come. \\"The prophecy\\" and \\"Only the good die young\\" are typical Maiden songs, rather enjoyable without having the ability to stand out from the rest of the material. \\"The clairvoyant\\" is another song built around the tempo and beat changes and even if it's a rather good one, it also gives a medley feeling since the pieces don't naturally fit into one another (but that doesn't seem to have ever bothered Steve Harris).  <br />Over all, this is a fine Iron Maiden album and you certainly get what you expect - there are no surprises! Still, I do think that albums like \\"Piece of mind\\" and \\"The number of the beast\\" are better, but \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" is clearly a stronger album than \\"No prayer for the dying\\" and \\"Fear of the dark\\", or anything with Blaze Baley\\" for that matter. Even if Maiden have sounded very different from this one at times, \\"Seventh son of a seventh son\\" might represent the Maiden approach best.

B00000I8UD|4|I think that David Sylvian is probably one of the finest &quot;non commercial&quot; music of our times. From the meditative &quot;Secrets from the Beehive&quot; to the extraordinary  and strong &quot;Gone to  earth&quot; and his innovative works with R. Sakamoto and Robert Fripp, he  has gave us a real gift of sensitite and unique music. Surely &quot;Dead  bees on a cake&quot; is not one of his best, but it doesn't matter  (although the track &quot;I surrender&quot; worth to buy it). Sylvian  deserves this kind of liberty. He's still an exception in our world, full  of &quot;money oriented&quot; musicians. Thanks David

This fits the book (: I would have liked a more substantial case; glossy cardboard disintegrates in the bottom of a carryall. However, getting it so fast was more important than the packaging.

B0009VTFB0|5|Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly. There is and was only one. It is hard to describe the attraction of this film, yet it still captivates me every time I view it. I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared. I suppose there is some comment being made about the morality of the lifestyles of both Holly and Paul (George Peppard) Varjak. Both seem to subsist on the money of others (Holly from her numerous men friends and Paul from his older female sexual benefactor Patricia Neal). Hepburn gives her character a glossy veneer of sophistication and a detached indifference for meaningful love and relationships from the opposite sex. Peppard in a very good and underplayed performance seems to be her conscience even though he has a difficult time putting his own life in order. Through all the partying and merriment I found Buddy Ebsen's performance as Doc to be the most touching and moving. He seemed to represent a yearning for a much more simpler and tranquil lifestyle, truly loving his Holly to make it all complete. Ebsen's performance is heartbreaking, as he must leave his Holly in a world very foreign to him, leaving the void in his heart still empty on his journey back home. I think Peppard sees this and knows he must change his ways and also those of Holly for whom he is so attracted. This is a truly wonderful entertaining and rewarding film working on so many levels. Adding to the overall effect is Henry Mancini's timely score that is so vibrant, elegant and sentimentally moving and captures the essence of the story so satisfyingly.

B004EPYZT4|5|Conan the Barbarian (2011)<br /><br />I didn't watch this in the cinemas because I was not at all impressed with the previews and trailers. Watched it in regular DVD today. I actually liked it. There is good reason why.<br /><br />This one has no connection nor shared mythology with the wonderful Arnold Schwarzenegger movies of the 80s - this one is a good followup though it failed to reboot the franchise at the box office. It is a good pulp action movie. Everything you would expect from a costume-sword-sorcery-legend. I didn't like the first few minutes with the narration, they should have worked it into the plot. But I guess if they did that, they would have to make long drawn out boring trilogy like The Lord of the Rings which is still not as worse as the boring snoozefest written by Tolkien. But after that brief narration, when this movie starts, it starts in amazing style and drama. You have to watch it to realise it.<br /><br />This is an engaging remake of the original Conan the Barbarian movies. Much better production of course, thanks to improvement in technology and design. I don't understand the criticisms of this movie. Sure, it is a predictable pulp fiction plot. But that is why I am watching it, no? A real pulp no-holds-barred thrill.<br /><br />The pace is good. The story doesn't rush forward. It unfolds its plot well. The action is on a grand scale. Real war. Million times better than watching a bunch of dwarf kids running around with a magical ring in Middle Earth. Conan rises. He is the prodigal son born out of war and death. His father raises him under due discipline. But Conan has wild barbarian blood in him. The child actor playing the young Conan, Leo Howard is brilliant. He does a good job showing the cold-blooded brutality and harsh reality of a savage world of an ancient era. The man playing his father is also a very good character actor here. The son grows up alone and he seeks revenge. He slays and pillages and loots. He has comrades. Butthe man he seeks, he shall fight him alone. This raw energy is well portrayed by the actor Jason Momoa. He is a fresh change from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Of course the image of Arnold as Conan the Barbarian shall be imprinted on our minds forever. But see this movie as a new one, a fresh narration. Actor Jason Momoa is an athletic, intelligent and impressive man, not the bulging angry hulk that Arnold portrayed. Jason Momoa is also quite handsome and delivers his lines well with good amount of emotion and strength in his voice. That dialogue delivery alone takes him up a few notches to match up with the legend that is Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is a more realistic depiction of an ancient warrior.<br /><br />During the making of the Arnold version of Conan, many scenes were cut on the editing table because of graphic violence. This 2011 version doesn't suffer that fate. Here the savagery is naked and startling. But the Arnold version was true to the sword and sorcery genre. This 2011 remake is more mainstream and seeks more \\"realistic\\" depiction of ancient warfare, chaos and belief systems. I like both. I can't pick one over the other. Both as they stand alone are beautifully made and well directed. The 2011 version is in epic proportions, a lot more money having been spent on making this one. The cinematography and lighting is very complimentary to the storyline as it progresses.<br /><br />Jason Momoa is a great find. I haven't seen any other movies of his. I would like to. I hope his career isn't affected by the boxoffice results of this Conan adventure. He has great potential as an action hero in any type of movie, period or modern. His talent shines here and carries the movie on his broad scarred shoulders as he rampages against an evil warlord. He is one good reason to go watch this movie. The other is the costumes. It is not overdone like in Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings. Here the costume doesn't steal the limelight and attention from the actors playing their vicious roles. In Conan 2011, the costumes blend in and become an essential accessory of the storyline. We don't get distracted. It just makes everything more real.<br /><br />The franchise has a real chance of surviving. It needs better brand management among other things. Such as a whole new storyline, updating the ancient Robert E. Howard texts by making it more attractive to modern day sword-sorcery-fantasy fans. This would mean a real reboot of the series. There is so much that can be done. I hope a serious director takes up this project in the near future and rebuilds it as it deserves to.<br /><br />The sets and location of Conan 2011 is spectacular. It overshadows any compliment you could give to the 1982 movie. The climax especially is in epic proportions and righly so. Lot of good work has gone into this movie and this is apparent as it progresses through the second half.<br /><br />Among other memorable characters, there is a real talent in the actress playing the evil daughter-witch - Rose McGowan. She exudes evil and she lives it in the role of Marique. Stunning! The other villains also steal the show. They are more memorable than say Conan's allies such as his pirate-friend or the master-thief. Stephen Lang does justice to his role as a warlord. He is not overtly evil. He is patient and wise and calculating. Well portrayed to bring a worthy adversary to Conan. And of course there is the incredibly recognisable and impressive narrative voice of Morgan Freeman retelling the legend of Conan.<br /><br />Actually, the movie needed better marketing effort. I now wish I had seen this on the big silver screen in 3D as it was meant to be. Never mind! Watch it, you won't be disappointed - it is a entertainer and awe-inspiring effort too. I am giving this 5 stars. The Oscar winners don't know what fun they are missing!<br /><br />Those who are complaining about this movie saying it is a travesty or saying that they liked the 1982 film but this one is horrible - you know, these are the same people who would have given bad reviews to the 1982 film if we were living in 1982. But now, they call that a great movie and call this poor. LOL.

0762449896|5|I bought this Enterprise on a whim at a brick-and-mortar store.  I wish I had checked Amazon to save a few bucks, but I'm too fond of this model to take it back now.<br /><br />Out of the box, the model comes in three parts:  Nacelles connected to square panel of engineering via pylons, Saucer and Engineering with a slot to fit the Nacelles section, and a Delta shape base insignia with a cylindrical tube to support the ship at  Engineering.  There is also a small booklet (3&#34; x 2.5&#34;) with some snippets of information about the USS Enterprise.<br /><br />The model is 4.875&#34; long, 2.125&#34; wide and 1.25&#34; tall and a bit bigger than a 1/2500 scale model.  It has very good sculpted details, with a lot of windows all over the engineering section and the saucer, lines around the nacelles and on top and bottom of the saucer to define the panels.  In addition, the deflector dish protrudes the right amount from the engineering section, the nacelles are parallel to each other and well aligned to the saucer and engineering sections.  Very nice for a hard plastic model.<br /><br />The detail on the paint are also very good.  The lettering is well defined on the name and numbering on top of the saucer, and numbering below the saucer and along the nacelles. The bussard collectors on the nacelles are made of a translucent-red plastic that catch the light very well.  Finally, red lines are painted along the nacelles and the engineering section.<br /><br />However, this model has a few inaccuracies.  The antenna on the middle of the deflector dish is a bit too long, and the fins on the nacelles are pointing straight up instead at an angle.  In addition, the impulse engine is not even hinted.  However, these issues are not that bad for me.<br /><br />This model does include a nice gimmick.  There is a switch underneath Engineering section that once turned on, some windows on the Saucer and the neck between Saucer and Engineering are lighted up by a bright white LED inside.  For a model this small, it adds a really nice touch.<br /><br />The included book is another nicety.  It contains: Introduction, A Five-Year Mission, Ship Schematic, Early Voyages and The Final Frontier.  It is only 32 pages long, so don't expect too much.  For example, there is no actual schematic, but bits of information and nice pictures.<br /><br />I think that the retail price is about right.  In all, I'm really happy with it.side.

0765325950|1|There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. Brandon Sanderson just wasn't a good choice to replace Robert Jordan.  Robert Jordan went overboard on his attention to minutiae, but Brandon Sanderson is even worse on the opposite end of the scale.  No disrespect to Jordan's widow, but I could wish that she had selected an author who more closely emulated her husband's writing style.  Overwhelming detail would be preferable to Sanderson's one-dimensional characters and story-telling, especially in this final installment.

0316168815|4|I was first drawn to this debut novel because my first novel was published at the same time, covering very similar subject-matter and themes. Kudoes to Alice Sebold for an interesting first effort. I found the story premise very original, and the story does linger in the mind for quite some time after you've read it. This is the story of a teenage girl named Susie who is raped and killed one day on her way to school. She goes to Heaven and is able to observe all the events around her dead body--her family's grief, her killer's footsteps, her friends' gossip about her murder, etc etc.  I kept guessing if they would catch the killer.

B009YU62H2|5|Chris Cornell shouts he's \\"Been Away Too Long\\" on the opening track of this amazing reunion album and I couldn't agree more. Hearing Soundgarden was back together sounded like a dream come true - fortunately the album does too. I've seen people say everything from \\"awesome\\" to \\"sounds like 'Down on the Upside.'\\" The indictment that Soundgarden sounds like they are picking up where they left off is not a criticism at all. For me, it's the greatest compliment possible that after over a decade of being apart, they have come back together as the solid rock machine they were through the 90s. They are titans in the same league as rock legends Led Zeppelin in my book, and they continue to hold that spot now. Cornell's voice is still outstanding. Thayil is still a guitar wizard. Matt Cameron still knows how to bring it on drums. Ben Shepherd is...wow...this guy just is an integral part of the sound, and he has not lost his touch either. Standout tracks...well, first let me say there is not a single throw away track on this masterpiece. Favs are \\"Non-State Actor\\", \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\", \\"Bones of Birds\\" and \\"Taree.\\" However, I could list every track. They are all 4s and 5s. Right now at this moment, the album is only $3.99 for download - how can you pass it up? Best money I've spent all year for what could be THE rock album of 2012.

B00CW7KK9K|3|I wanted to like this device, I was trying to convince myself that it was better than the Fitbit One, but it just can't beat 4 years and 3 revisions of experience. I own the Withings Smart Scale, which is amazing, and I wanted to keep within that ecosystem, but it isn't cutting it.<br /><br />I owned both the Pulse and the One at the same time for a few days and I had my gripes with both, but the Fitbit won in the end. I will list how the Withings is better:<br />- Easy to slip in and out of the belt clip<br />- Touchscreen and history is a great addition.<br />- Bluetooth 2.0 support, no need for a dongle for your PC. (I own an Android)<br />- The heart rate monitor is a neat feature, but it is nothing my phone can't do.<br />- Micro USB charging is convenient and you don't need a proprietary device to charge.<br />- Elevation is measured in feet, and not floors.<br />- The battery life is impressive, but isn't any better than the Fitbit One. I never went over a week without the \\"20%\\" notification popping up.<br /><br />Now I will list its drawbacks from the One:<br />- The overall build quality feels cheaper.<br />- Belt clip is not as tight and it HAS disconnected from my body a couple times.<br />- Soft touch plastic scratches way to easy.<br />- No vibrate function, which is honestly very handy with my Fitbit.<br />- No right/left handed options. So when it it clipped on your right side the display is upside down.<br />- No way to calibrate your stride.<br /><br />** 8 Aug 2013 - I don't know if the Fitbit does this, but I lost an entire day of activity because my Pulse didn't turn off of sleep mode. I think that this device would benefit from a firmware update that would automatically turn off sleep mode when it detects steps for a certain amount of time. I was running around airports all day and noticed tonight that I slept for 22 hours...**<br /><br />Sure the ability to view history and take your pulse is neat, but those functions are rendered obsolete whenyou are using the device with a smartphone. I can view history on my phone, take my pulse, track my diet, and much more. Fitness trackers are made to show you how active you are in the day and night. At the end of the day, Fitbit has a much more refined product. Sure it isn't compatible with USB 2.0, but the Fitbit can be synced using the computer. I spend hours of my day next to a computer, and syncing is no problem. Just not immediate.<br /><br />It's the small things that the Withings wins in, but that's what they are, small things. Fitbit has used their experience in the fitness market and made a great upgrade to the older devices that were already fantastic. Maybe Withings will come out with a armband that will blow things out of the water.

B00028HBKM|5|The best art has a backstory of sacrifice and hardship and Mel Gibson's work of art, The Passion of the Christ has such a backstory.  In 2003, Passion producer Mel Gibson, was accused of every sort of malice from the Hollywood elite that is hostile to this movie, Christianity, and Western Civilization in general.<br /><br />The movie is the story of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ and it is filmed in a color tone that reminds the viewer of a Renaissance painting of the same subject.  It is also unique in that the dialogue is spoken in Latin and Aramaic, the languages of the time.  Greek is left out although it was the lingua franca of the Eastern Roman Empire.<br /><br />The movie make a point to emphasize the various smaller Saints that were part of the story.  For example, Pontius Pilatus' wife, an Orthodox Saint, is favorably featured.  An Ethiopian servant is also shown as receptive to the message of Christ.<br /><br />The movie is graphic, torture and blood is featured, however the affair is artfully done.  Violence, after all is a major part of art.<br /><br />Most movies pushed from Hollywood is nothing more than \\"dreck,\\" but this work is high art melding the classic works of da Vinci, Albrecht D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, and Michelangelo with the modern medium of cinema.  This movie should be shown on Network TV every Good Friday.

0765350386|5|Mistborn was the first Sanderson book I picked up, after hearing that he would be finishing The Wheel of Time, which, at that time, was my favorite fantasy series. I was wondering who this kid was, and if he was really any good at all. Needless to say, this means that I went into Mistborn with very high standards, standards that I was fairly sure wouldn’t be met.<br /><br />They were.<br /><br />I don’t think I’ve read a book that has exceeded my expectations by this much since—every new Sanderson I read continues to blow me away, but I already have the highest expectations of those books, and I have decently high expectations of everything else I read too. Perhaps one or two debut novels—The Emperor’s Blades, for instance—have met this mark, but even that is debatable.<br /><br />But what makes Mistborn so great? Well, what doesn’t?<br /><br />Sanderson has brought his signature magic system creation to the table, giving us Allomancy, a skill, generally thought to be genetically passed on, which grants the user the ability to ingest and burn certain metals to temporarily gain magical powers. It’s really interesting, as per Sanderson’s second law of magic, because of its limitations: You can only burn as much metal as you have in you, some metals are incredibly rare, and some metals burn much more quickly than others.<br /><br />Paired with the Allomancy is the world of Scadrial, another brilliant creation. Covered in giant volcanoes (ashmounts), which belch ash into the atmosphere, staining everything with soot and requiring a huge workforce to keep the cities clean, Scadrial is also subject to nightly mists, which cover the entire planet. These mists are the domain of the Allomancers, which gives them—and the book—the name of Mistborn. It’s an incredibly evocative image of a planet, and one that I loved reading about.<br /><br />And he’s filled the planet with incredibly interesting people. The skaa, the slave class, have been oppressed for centuries, and forbidden from mating with the non-skaa, for fear that Allomantic powers might leak through. But, of course, this restriction hasn’t really worked out all that well for the Lord Ruler, the, uh, ruler of The Final Empire, and there are some among the skaa with magical powers.<br /><br />But, of course, the world is nothing, the the story is nothing, without interesting characters. And Sanderson has created a cast of them.<br /><br />There’s Kelsier, a skaa, and yet, somehow, a full Allomancer, with power over all of the metals. He’s survived an incredibly tragic and harsh past, yet he always manages to smile in the face of danger and despair. He wants revenge upon the Lord Ruler, and he is assembling a crew to help him get it. He and his crew are an utterly awesome band with a really cool dynamic—some of my favorite chapters in the book are the planning chapters, where the whole group is in one room, simply talking.<br /><br />The main character, Vin, is a street urchin skaa who is trying to survive as part of a thieving crew. But when the crew’s latest hit goes awry, she’s in mortal danger—until Kelsier decides to recruit her. Vin’s growth through the story, as she slowly gains the ability to trust others, and her sheer resilience to whatever life throws at her make her an instant favorite, and she is a truly kick-ass heroine.<br /><br />Elend Venture is the man I would wish to be if I were living on Scadrial. Born to the nobility, he’s not satisfied with the government, and in an empire where such meetings are declared treasonous by the all-power Lord Ruler, he has a close selection of friends who plot ways to better the government—even if it means going against the Lord Ruler’s orders, or overthrowing parts of his system. He also has an incredible love of books, and an utterly disarming attitude that I absolutely love.<br /><br />The villains, Lord Venture, the Inquisitors, the Lord-Ruler… They are all utterly terrifying, and Sanderson has done them all brilliantly. In a world where GRRM-like books are becoming more and more common, it’s nice to have some villains I can just straight up hate, and some heroes I can cheer for.<br /><br />Although, as Kelsier says, “There’s always another secret.”<br /><br />In summary, Mistborn is the brilliant beginning to one of my favorite trilogies of all time, with an utterly unique Sanderson magic system, a dark, ash-covered world, a spunky, yet flawed heroine, and a cool team of thieves who want to pull of the heist of the millennium, and I can’t recommend it highly enough. Five of Five stars, and if you’ve not read this book yet, I may have to disown you.<br /><br />Review originally from my blog, MentalMegalodon., and Sanderson has done them all brilliantly.

0743277708|4|Going into this book, all I knew was that it was a classic that was about talking bunnies. Now, I've never been a big fan of rabbits, but I decided to give this a try anyway. I mean a five hundred page book about rabbits? I had to see what this was all about.<br /><br />After the initial charm wore off, I was bored. I found all the rabbits to be interchangeable, and some of their folklore confusing. But, it got better as it went on, especially those final 200 hundred pages. I found some of their chapter-long fables distracting, as well as a sudden switch to the human world. There would be random comments about baseball or something to describe a situation, and it would draw me out of the story. I also didn't like the portrayal of does as just sex-objects, which would make me have less sympathy for the rabbits plight. I have to say, for the most part, I forgot they were bunnies. The writing was easily read, and it wasn't to hard to follow. If I was a tad smarter, I could figure out all the parallels between bunny warrens and human government, but I'm too lazy for that.<br /><br />Even though it is usually marketed as a young adult book, I think anyone can enjoy it. Overall, it was a enjoyable fantasy and quite epic.
B00SH04286|4|Good
B00CKJTOHO|5|It's Dexter!  I've been hooked since the first season and never once been disappointed.  The writing is as good as it was in the very beginning.
B000JLSLZQ|5|A must have if you love musical numbers and romance. My sisters and I even all have the soundtrack from the movie. Very catchy songs.
B006DJ2JSI|5|Love it
0694003611|5|This isn't my personal favorite book, but somehow it's become a successful part of LO's bedtime routine. Been reading it since he was born. I'd say it's a must in every house.
B00AEBB9O6|4|For once Hollywood isn't portraying Vietnam era military men as crazed baby killers and drug addicts.<br />This is a story of the courage of US military troops in a real battle which sticks to the facts.<br />The Military Channel did a show on this battle and if you get a chance to watch that show, it will make this movie even more powerful.
B0083H6AQA|5|Well done version of a Guy De Maupassant classic.
B00F9A903O|4|i loved until it stop loading on my kindle

B008JFUQ3O|5|Excellent movie! One of the funniest (and best) CG movies I've seen since Toy Story! Definitely worth buying. It will be hard to top this movie if part 3 drops.
B00GTCECVG|5|I think this game is AWESOME

B002W1UEW4|2|Henry: This week, we're reviewing is GI Joe. As a child of the 80s I have been forced to<br />watch my favorite cartoons being turned into mediocre Hollywood movies for the past several<br />years (Transformers, Speed Racer). Armed with that knowledge, I marched into battle against<br />G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.<br />Sims: Nicely put.<br />Henry: Yeah... Thanks. Now, I wanted to hate, HATE this movie. I had such low<br />expectations I actually went to see this at 11:00 AM. on a Tuesday. But because I had set the bar<br />so low, I can honestly say it is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Directed by Stephen<br />Sommers of The Mummy film series, G.I. Joe has the same energy and style of Sommers’<br />previous work, but none of the story. The action sequences did not disappoint, although with the<br />amount of computer effects used, it could have been re-titled CGI Joe. So what did Sundance<br />Sims think?<br />Sims: I had a GI Joe once. In the second grade. It was stolen from the classroom. True story.<br />Henry: Stolen?<br />Sims: I looked all over for it. Stolen. In my estimation, by a certain Mr. Dirk Pettigrew.<br />Henry: Uh, Sims?<br />Sims: I think once you're named Dirk, it's all over. Might as well just tattoo the word<br />“Hoodlum” in big goth letters between your shoulder blades and call it a day.<br />Henry: You didn't watch the movie, did you?<br />Sims: (after a slightly awkward pause) No. Not at all.<br />Henry: (ignoring response and moving forward) The only stand out in GI Joe, the movie we<br />were supposed to review this week, is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, taking on the campy, yet fun role of<br />the Doctor who ultimately becomes leader of the Cobra. When he is on screen, I felt like I was<br />watching my favorite 80s cartoon again.<br />Sims: GI Joe wasn't a cartoon—he was a soldier. If you want to see a truly great soldier<br />movie, check out “Winter of 1914,” a beautifully-produced short film featuring great sound<br />engineering from Cape May Film Academy instructor and graduate Collin Pritchard. It was<br />featured in the 2007 Film Festival and is available through our office. It tells the true story of a<br />one-day truce on Christmas Day. Join the more than 82,000 people who watched the trailer on<br />YouTube (just search by the title).<br />Henry: Fair enough... I'd like to check that out. Well, in summary, GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra<br />is flawed... but ultimately fun. Would I pay to see this again – no. But now I know where to set<br />my expectations when ThunderCats the movie is released. And as they say, knowing is half the<br />battle.r />engineering from Cape May Film Academy instructor and graduate Collin Pritchard.

B005544TRQ|5|Great characters, quick plot movement, lots of fun!  Somewhat predictable but still a good time.  A great way to pass an afternoon.
B00F8L2VO4|5|It's amazing this is free it actually does teach you a language and its fun. Gives you a sense of accomplishment.
B00DL2W7Q4|3|Very easy reading.  The ending of the book comes a bit as a surprise.

B000003TAR|5|After the pop, classical, melodies of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, NIRVANA goes back to where it all began. &quot;In Utero&quot; brings back the punk rock , pure pre-grunge energy that can be found in NIRVANA's first recording,  &quot;Bleach&quot;. This punk energy can be seen in songs such as  &quot;Very Ape&quot;, the totally pschycodelic &quot;Milk It&quot;, the  hard-hitting blast of &quot;Rape Me&quot;, &quot;tourette's&quot; or even  in the beautifully melodic &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. This record also  has sweet, heart touching lyrics - some of Cobain's best work is resembled  in songs like &quot;Dumb&quot;, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, &quot;Frances  Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle&quot;- despite the fact that most  of the lyrics make references to death, diseases and carry on a  maniac-depressive estethic. Being much less comercial than  &quot;Nevermind&quot;, this record is, consequently, much more pure, honest  and raw. The art work -showing the life cicle- is very nice. It is, in my  opinion, the most beautiful one I've ever seen. To end this review, I'd  just like to say that if you only like NIRVANA's hit songs and you never  listened to a whole album, then you probably won't like this one. But if  you're a real fan, this album is absolutely necessary for you. And,  generally speaking, this is one of the greatest albums of one of the  greatest bands of all time, so it is totally worth every pennie you pay for  it.
B009AMANH4|5|My wife is into the Lincoln era and wanted to rent this movie. At the price here, I bought it as a gift. She now has it in her collection and has enjoyed being able to play it on her TV or computer....
0780622650|5|I loved it, because I saw the tv series. People would say the ending is lame, then instantly they jugde the film bad. Why : because it just suddenly end (not showing that they completed the mission they were sent  for in the film). They should have released it a bit later, working on the  parts of the movie they had to cut ,like the ending of the film (or was the  film to long originally, so they had to cut it ?). Great to se, I will buy  it in my next batch of movies
B00KK0PICK|5|As soon as I began reading and had the basics down, I began tidying. It really was (and continues to be) a fulfilling experience. The book seems silly at times, both in prose and concept (talking to your home and possessions), but in practice is actually quite practical. I have a long way to go, but after two weeks I have donated two cars full of clothing and my drawers and closets look fantastic. My husband was so inspired he did the same thing without my prompting. This is a lifestyle! I love it. Thank you, Marie!

0307383415|5|If you can, forget that Barack Obama is the twice-elected, first black president in American history. This volume, written as Obama was preparing to enter politics in 1995, is a deeply lyrical and intelligent telling of his own story, and that of coming of age as a black man in America. Obama is a gifted writer. He recreates the episodes and voices of his life, including the swaggering street talk of those from his high school and community organizing days. The son of a white mother and African father, he details his struggles to make sense of the absence of his father (who left him at the age of two) and the tortured path of finding his identity. Obama grew up between worlds. His white grandparents were from the Midwest, with its mythos of continuous progress and its memories of horrifying setbacks. He was born in Hawaii, a multi-ethnic blend of white, black and Asian, but felt out of place in its wealthy prep schools. He followed his mother and stepfather Lolo to Indonesia, where he picked up firsthand the rhythms, language and values of the Third World. But it was not until he travelled to Kenya, after the death of his father, that the threads of his life started to come together.<br /><br />As I said, Obama is a fine writer. But he is also a wonderful and honest analyst. His struggles for identity are played against a backdrop of poor project dwellers in Chicago, an aimless college start that didn't presage his future brilliance, and the continued distrust between black and white in America and the ever absent and mythologized figure of his father. Had he never become president, this book could well have become the defining work of the age on the subject of race and identity. It is deeply personal, showing a young man's stumbling attempts to make sense of the world around him. And it is a frank book, with Obama working in references to reefer, alcohol and sexual adventure - the very building blocks of youth in America in the 1960s and 70s.<br /><br />For those who are his supporters, \\"Dreams from my Father\\" anticipates the politician and man he became - cool, cerebral, but with a touch of street savvy and personal pain that make him so engaging to listen to. For his detractors, the book will be a goldmine of attack points meant to bring him own as a man and to prove their theories of black depravity. Forget all the hoohah from those like Dinesh D'Souza (\\"2016: Obama's America\\") who blew up a single episode from the book (and got it wrong, at that) to impugn Obama as a deceiver trying to fulfill his father's supposedly socialist dreams. The true \\"Dreams of my Father\\" has the intensity, longing and honesty that will ring true to anyone who has had to fight a battle for their identity in an ever-shifting landscape, and to attempt to pick up the torch dropped by their ancestors in search of the impossible dream of wholeness.ho are his supporters, \\"Dreams from my Father\\" anticipates the politician and man he became - cool, cerebral, but with a touch of street savvy and personal pain that make him so engaging to listen to.

Thank you so much Dr. Moriarty for writing this book!!!<br />All for L.O.V.E
0316228532|5|It seems this book is one that people love, or they hate. The one star reviews for price isn't fair to the book or its author, nor are the reviews from people who didn't read it, or just a read bit of it.<br /><br />For everyone who insists this book has to have something in common with the Harry Potter books.  The Casual Vacancy is what would have happened to Harry had there not been magic and Hogwarts to save him.<br /><br />The Dursleys were self satisfied, self important, stingy, petty, little people who were overly concerned with appearances, and what the neighbors would say. In the Sorcerer's Stone; Petunia Dursley was described as a gossipy window watcher. Vernon was cruel to Harry. Remember how many times he locked Harry in his cupboard, and later in his bedroom without food? The memories Harry had...of being chased up a tree by Aunt Marge's dogs, and not let down until after midnight. The clothing the Dursleys made Harry wear; all of Dudley's castoffs that clearly did not fit, and Harry's glasses that were mended with tape. His body clearly showed the lack of food.  You would think that any concerned neighbor would have turned the Dursleys into social services, but in ten years no one at his school, or any of his neighbors took  the time or effort to look into Harry's situation. Clearly Harry was an abused and neglected child. The people at school, and the neighbors, were too wrapped up in their own petty concerns to take pity on a neglected orphaned boy. JK Rowling described a desperate living situation for Harry, and I took it as a scathing commentary on social injustices way back then. I think Ms Rowling has wanted to expose the underbelly of social injustice even before she wrote Harry Potter, but you can clearly see the seeds of The Casual Vacancy had been planted years ago!<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a look at people in situations where they can't take care of themselves. Yes, addiction is awful, and ugly. What is does to the innocent children is uglier. The kids have no choice as to who they are born to. Since they have no functioning parent they are left with little choice. They do what they must do to survive, or they don't survive at all. Without help from people with better life circumstances the cycle of abuse and neglect will only perpetuate itself. The people with better circumstances seem to see these helpless little victims as a burden, or worse; somehow they deserve their lot in life. Without help how can they possibly get out?<br /><br /> The Casual Vacancy is a tough book to read, but I think an important one. It is a book that shines a light on how cruelly we human beings can be toward one another. How we can take pleasure tormenting each other, how many of us become so wrapped up in our own little dramas that we become blind to other's suffering, or choose to look away; how we prey upon those weaker than ourselves, and how when we do nothing the consequences can be devastating. I think that is the point of the book. We have to stop looking away.<br /><br />Something to think about; If Harry were a real boy, in the real world, living in the situation described, and showing the anger he did toward the Dursleys; how long would it be before sweet little 11 year old Harry became a snarling, out of control, rebellious teenager?  Given the complete lack of love from the Dursleys what might Harry do to them or to himself? If no one intervened on Harry's behalf there would be no telling.
