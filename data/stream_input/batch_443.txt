B00005221M|5.0|A truly excellent film.  I've owned the VHS and two of the DVD (letter box and panamorphic/DTS) versions.<br /><br />So much good has already been said so far, there's no need to repeat it.  I wanted to mention a few criticisms that I haven't read thus far, cristicisms that prevent this film/DVD from being truly outstanding.<br /><br />* The music was written by two composers, Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman.  They didn't write it conjunction but, rather, Randy Edelman came in and finished up Jones' work after Jones' and director Michael Mann parted over artistic differences.  The truly wonderful, passionate, breathtaking music comes from the work of Trevor Jones.  Randy Edelman, who seems to have only one soundtrack that he uses for all his movies with only small variations, makes you wonder if you're watching other movies he's done (Gettysburg, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, etc.)  Fortunately, in the film Trevor's score is emphasized.  (Sadly, the opposite is true in the soundtrack.)<br /><br />* As mentioned previously, this is the director's cut, where scenes have both been added and deleted.  One thing I really didn't like about the original was the use of a modern, New Age, Celtic sound (\\"I Will Find You\\") during a \\"chase\\" montage toward the end of the film.  It was a great song, but too modern and out of place in the original sequence (it would have been more fitting for the credits).  It thus took the viewer out of the story and the period in which he/she had been so immersed for the first hour and a half.  In the director's cut, this song has been removed and replaced with music more harmonious to the rest of the soundtrack.<br /><br />* The letter box version of the DVD had a nice documentary about how the battle scenes were filmed.  It was a great documentary but it's gone in this panamorphic/DTS version.  (The enhanced video and audio are worth the compromise, however.)<br /><br />* There's no commentary track, which is too bad.  It would have been interesting to learn what is historical fact from fiction, what was invented and taken from Cooper's book, the behind the scenes decisions to add or remove scenes, etc.<br /><br />* The biggest criticism I have about the film, which sadly didn't change in this new extended version, was that the last 20 minutes of the film seems very rushed.  The movie's only 1 hour and 50 minutes long, so there was clearly time to take another 20 minutes and give us a little bit more sense that Hawkeye's search for Miss Munro was something for which he truly sacrificed.  As it is, it seemed as if it was a race run over a very quick span.  After the I-will-find-you scene, this leaves the audience with an anti-climatic sense of \\"Well, she wasn't all that difficult to find after all\\".<br /><br />All these criticisms aside, a truly excellent film and a must have DVD.en interesting to learn what is historical fact from fiction, what was invented and taken from Cooper's book, the behind the scenes decisions to add or remove scenes, etc. <br /> <br />* The biggest criticism I have about the film, which sadly didn't change in this new extended version, was that the last 20 minutes of the film seems very rushed.

B000002OX7|5.0|Dude I was about to bash the living hell out of your Led Zeppelin IV review for dissing the hell out of Black Friggn Sabbath, but with this review you completely redeem yourself. FYI this album really has been kicking ass for the past 30 years I know because I was 8 when this first came out in England. Masterpieces like \\"Baba O'Riley\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" \\"Won't get Fooled Again\\" \\"Bargain\\" and \\"My Wife\\" can all be found here, but there is more on here I'm just labeling what I remember from the vinyl cover. Anyway get this album its a masterpiece, and don't check out that disgraceful garbage trash band Limp Bizkits version of \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", it disgrace a Who masterpiece and I think Fred Durst should be hung for disgracing Pete Townshend's songwriting skills.
B00005JMFQ|2.0|I don't mean to be deliberately narrow-minded when I say this movie made my skin crawl. I went into the theatre excited to see Emma Thompson in a new film role and I left extremely angry at the limited roles women play in this film. They're all seen through the lens of the male and this angered me particularly.<br /><br />Love portrayed in this film is not \\"love actually.\\" It's still love according to Hollywood. The lovers are all beautiful physically. Their situations are idealized--even Emma Thompson's, whose husband cheats on her--and characterization is nil.<br /><br />Skip this movie and watch \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" instead.
0920668372|5.0|I have read this book to my 3 sons hundreds of times and I am still touched by the love shown from mother to son. This is my favorite child book. I have read many to my sons, but nothing compares! I have bought copies of this book and have given them to mommy-to-be at baby showers. Only after they read it for the first time, as they hold their little one in their arms, will they realize how hard it is to hold back the tears.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Excellent Extras.  This very affecting film puts the complex story behind George Bush's War on Iraq into perspective.  It's better on DVD that it was in the theatres - there's so much information to take in you can at least pause and review.  Moore clearly has his point of view, but you can't deny the reality of what your seeing for real in Iraq and at home.
B000002BQK|5.0|Mariah Carey makes yet another GREAT album.  This is a wonderful display of her many talents.  This should be in everyone's radio!  Here's the breakdown: <br />1. Honey-5/5-This song made history, as many of MC's other songs!!  It debuted at #1.  This song has an awesome video and the lyrics are wonderfully written.  Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs, as he was called then, helped out.  This song will make ya bob ya head!  LOL! <br />2. Butterfly-5/5-This is an AMAZING song.  So beautifully written.  Mariah's voice sails and sores through the high notes, however at the beginning of the track, she limits her so way too much, however, by the closing, she blows you away.  AWSOME all around. <br />3. My All-5/5-Great song, great music, great lyrics, no wonder it was #1.  This single sold so well, that it was re-released with different remixes.  This single has sold millions of copies; however, was only #1 on Billboard Hot 100 Charts for 1 week.  Mariah's voice never lets you down, such a beautiful, romantic song. <br />4. The Roof-5/5-Good beat.  Loving it.  It might take you a few times to appreciate this song, but it's worth the few times.  This song stays in your head long after you have listened to it.  It's a laid-back, easy going song.  Mariah's voice is in-tune, but when is it not? <br />5. The Forth of July-5/5-Many people say this song is filler, not a good song.  I totally DISAGREE with them.  This song is a standout track to me.  The beat during the chorus is awesome.  The lyrics are superb as normal.  This is a great song to drive to and just be. <br />6. Breakdown-5/5-This is my favorite song of the album.  I love the lyrics and meaning behind this track.  It is so true and many people can say they have been there.  As Mariah said herself, it's like Always Be My Baby Part 2.  This track has a great video.  The guest rappers are a great addition and only help this already great song.  Mariah's voice is awesome. <br />7. Babydoll-4/5-Missy Elliott and Mariah always make a great team.  They collaborated on the writing of this song.  I read a review back in 1997 that said this was an over sexual song, not for kids, and don't catch this butterfly...come on people, lay off of Mariah.  How many other artist is more sexual or more explicit than Mariah?  This is a great song showing how you want someone.  Great song. <br />8. Close My Eyes-4/5-This is a personal song.  Great lyrics.  I love the music to it also.  Mariah's voice is great as normal, but a little limited.  Great track. <br />9. Whenever You Call-5/5-This is my second favorite song.  I love the lyrics to this song.  Such a beautifully written song.  Brilliant lyrics.  This should have been a single.  So many people could love and relate to this song.   <br />10. Fly Away (Butterfly Reprise)-3/5-I am not a big fan of this type of remix deal.  Great dance number, however, the original is so much better.  Not bad, not great. <br />11. The Beautiful Ones-5/5-I love this remake of Prince's song.  Dru Hill sings with Mariah and makes this song so beautiful.  Their voices are superb together.  This is a standout track and should have gotten more attention than it did.  Mariah out does herself album after album. <br />12. Outside-4/5-I love the lyrics, but Mariah's vocals are way too limited, she sounds like she holds herself back.  This is truly a beautiful song.  One of the best, gives you comfort when you feel so alone, so outside.  A great song. <br />OVERALL-This is a WONDERFUL album.  It was #1 for 1 week.  Has sold more than 5 million copies since 1997.  This is one of Mariah's best ever and will always remain one of her best.  This gave Mariah two more #1 hits, \\"Honey\\" and \\"My All\\".  This album is awesome; you must RUN to buy this NOW!!  You will LOVE IT!! <br />
0765301598|3.0|That thing is the difference between the old way of doing things and the new way of doing things.  The nearest thing I can equate these books to is the difference between the New Star Wars movies and the old.  In fact those movies and these books have a lot of things in common.  They are both set in the same universe(or so we are told) and both have basically the same charecters.   <br /> <br />The old books feel freash and orginal able to inspire the imagination after so many years.   <br />Brian don't you realize that Dune was my introduction to the world of Science Fiction?  <br /> Kevin can't you understand that you write better on your own and not when you are butchering some creation of another person?   <br /> <br />For love of God as much as I liked the book, and i'm not saying there were not good parts there is just on cmparsion between the different books.  You also should be wary of comdeming something out of hand please read this book first(get it from the library) <br /> <br />Overall-I'm going to read the orginal \\"Dune\\" agian bye.
B00000JLWW|1.0|This movie was terrible.  It does not even diserve the minimum one star that I had to rate it with.  All that you honestly do while watching this movie is wait two and a half hours only to see everyone die.  The cheesy love story is a flat out waste of time.  The only enloyable thing that can be done with this movie is to check and see if the physics behind the people sliding around and falling off of the ship is accurate.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I am always apprehensive to buy star-band albums. Velvet Revolver sucked majorly mainly because of Weiland and Slash. Thirteenth step, on the other hand, is great. Its very musical. Its definitely very deep. Effort has been put into this. Its great.     Highlight: Vanishing
B00005JKC3|1.0|Waste of money, waste of energy. all together useless
B0000029DD|5.0|This album (CD) by Jeff Buckley will make you happy you have someone special in your life (In my case- my wife) and will make you fall in love with them all over again. Guaranteed!
B00005JNJ7|4.0|In the process of letting the air out of some VERY inflated egos, Parker and Stone have delivered a film that is a better homage to Gerry Anderson's Supermarionation films and TV shows than the embarrassment that was the Thunderbirds movie earlier this year. The puppet work is both amazingly good and deliberately cheesy at the same time, a combination that works perfectly.  <br /> <br />The deadly seriousness with which our society elevates actors to \\"expert\\" status in every field imaginable _needs_ lampooning, and I loved every bit of Team America's satire. That the film wasn't quite vicious enough in this regard was a minor disappointment to me, but given the insanity that celebrated Michael Moore's nonsense this past summer, Parker and Stone probably went as far as they could. (Maybe it's me - I mean, how much more could I really ask them to do with Michael Moore than what they did?) <br /> <br />The state of Broadway needs an entire Parker/Stone film devoted to it, so I wanted to see more on this subject than the one (brilliant) song in the movie. I really think the movie needed at least one more song somewhere in it - the songs from this team are always great. But all this, I suppose, is a good sign for this movie: I wanted more of everything. \\"Leave 'em wanting more\\" is an old show-biz axiom, and Team America left me hoping Parker and Stone will be in show biz for a good long time, so they can deliver more.
B000002H70|5.0|I've been listening to this one for about 15 years now... Never felt sick or tired and I think I never will...still breaks my heart, even worse than ever before.Best album of the century let me say first...and last...and always...Nothing particularly about the music...So perfect and well done.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I have been enjoying this CD tremendously! I listen to it almost every day while I'm working. It is honest and very pure and I absolutely love it!  <br /> <br />
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I think this could be the best album MK has ever done... <br />In Shangri La you can find rock, blues, beautiful lyrics, poetry as well. <br />5.15am, boom like that, sucker row, trawlerman song, postcards from paraguay and Don't crash the ambulance are all 5 stars song, the others goes from 3 to 4 stars... <br />Want more? <br />And be sure, if you love music you'll love this album!
B0000524E5|5.0|This movie is a pretty touching story that focuses on one persons struggle to reach her dream. A small town girl wants to be a songwritter so she sets her sights on the big city of NY to try and make it big. problem is in NY its who you know and she knows no one. After her low rent apartment is robbed she stays determined and gets the only job she thinks she can get which is the hot bar called Coyote Ugly. The bar is the complete opposite of her as instead of her being shy, she has to act spontanious and wild. won't get all in the details but pretty much leads to her finding the perfect guy, accepted by her father to live her dreams, and well, find her dreams. A movie to definately check out since it has the tenderness for the women and the girls dancing naughty for the guys.
B000000H66|5.0|I finished reviewing all the rest of Death's studio albums some time ago, so I figured it was time I got around to doing this one.  Personally, I prefer Sound of Perseverance and Human, and possibly even Individual Thought Patterns to this album, but it's still pretty damn great.  No, nothing here comes anywhere close to sucking, and most of it puts the best work of most other metal bands to shame.  Definitely mandatory to all metal fans.<br /><br />Here Death continue their stylistic evolution.  ITP was lighter and more melodic than Human, with increased technicality to boot.  On Symbolic Schuldiner increases the heaviness a bit and cuts down on the melody a bit,(though it's still less heavy and more melodic than Human) and expands the song structures, making them a bit more epic and varied than on ITP.  It's also a bit less frantic, and probably not quite as technically accomplished as ITP.(though it's still pretty amazing) Still, despite the changes, it's still the same basic style, which I'd say is progressive/technical death-thrash, with a bit more melody than either of those genres is naturally inclined towards.<br /><br />The line up has changed a bit, once again, but it's still better than most metal bands could dream of being.  Schuldiner is my favorite lead guitarist, and he is particularly excellent here, and the riffs are complex and highly varied.  He doesn't give one of his best vocal performances, but he's definitely still good, and writes some of the more memorable vocal lines of his career, even if he doesn't deliver them quite as well.  Koelble isn't as good as a second guitarist as either Hamm or LaRocque, imo, but he can still shred and has a particularly strong melodic sensibility. Most of leadwork is left to Chuck, however, which is good since he's the best of any of them. Gene Hoglan is unquestionably one of the greatest metal drummers ever, and this is the best performance I've heard from him, and probably one of the 5 best I've heard from anyone. (Unquestionably top 10) He can change tempos on a dime, is both spectacularly powerful and intricate, uses loads of double bass and plays some of the most devastating fills you'll ever here.  Those interested in metal drumming need by this album for that, if no other reason.(though there are plenty of other reasons...)  Conlon isn't as interesting of a bassist as DiGiorgio, and his role is noticeably less prominent than his was, but he still does a good job.  He's plays a supportingly role, naturally, but it certainly isn't easy to support players as impressive as the rest of the band.<br /><br />Although all the songs here follow the same basic structural pattern the songwriting is still quite complex and intricate, as pretty much everything here is going very fast at some times and quite slow at others.  Unfortunately, I don't think that the individual tracks are quite as distinctive as they were on ITP on would be on SoP.  I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this way, but I definitely do, and it is a slight weakness on this album.(pretty much the only one, as a matter of fact)  As I said before everything here is good, but some things really stand out.  1,000 Eyes is the best track here, and is truly an underrated Death song.  It's pretty much a perfect song, with great riffs, the best chorus on the album and a fair bit of melody to go along with some awesome leads.  Crystal Mountain is excellent, with some of the best vox on the album, and some especially prominent and melodic leadwork.  It's not quite like anything else on the album, or anything else from Death's later years.  Misanthrope starts out with a fantastic riff, and is one of the more and intense works on the album until it comes to the particularly odd and jarring chorus.  This is a pretty startling and effective juxtaposition, and it's got another sweet solo.  Great song, once again.  Zero Tolerance is a bit more deliberate and atmospheric than some of the other tracks, and particularlydark and angry as well.  Chuck's vox during the chorus are quite eerie, and the speedier, more melodious instrumental break just thereafter is particularly effective.  More great contrast, and another excellent track.  I could go on, but suffice to say everything on here is excellent.  The final track, Perennial Quest, is the only relative weak point, and it's definitely a good song.  It does slow down a bit too much at a few points and loses some momentum, and just isn't as inspired overall as the other tracks.(This is, however, largely a reflection of how good the album is in general rather than of any particular weakness in the song.)<br /><br />Death were one of the greatest metal bands of all time, and while this isn't quite their best album, it ain't too far off either.  No more recommendation than that ought to be needed..  Chuck's vox during the chorus are quite eerie, and the speedier, more melodious instrumental break just thereafter is particularly effective.

6305212112|5.0|I saw this movie about 10 years after it came out. Loved it! I don't care what anyone says about it.  <br /> <br />I would like to thank the person who explained the relationship between Idgie Threadgoode and Ninny Threadgoode. That did throw me at first, but I do recall that Ninny mentioned that she had a crush on Idgie's brother Buddy and she was also married to Idgie's brother, Cleo, later on.  <br /> <br />As to the person who remarked that everything PC was up front in this movie....well, not completely. White men are NOT depicted as only evil. They forgot about Smokey Lonesome who loved Ruth, the white guy who drove with Idgie and Big George to bring Ruth to Idgie's place (though he was a little cowardly), and most of all, Grady Kilgore who truly loved Idgie even though he got hooked up with Gladys. <br /> <br />I have not read the book, but as to the lesbianism...how come everybody but me picks up on that? I'm a southerner myself and, my god, women have lots of loving relationships without being lesbians. How come nobody writes about straight people who have close relationships with their own kind without being gay? They do exist.

0684135051|4.0|I bought this book at the same time as EZ's earlier ones, knitting around, and a knitters almanac. The earlier books had more of her thinking and stories of knitting than this one which i enjoyed. I feel this has been written for the modern market, glossy photo's, and a clear designed layout. As a result iI found this book less enjoyable and meaty than the others, plus it contains a rework of her earlier methods, and missed some of my favorites, but still fantastic for those seeking to break away from patterns, wanting to learn to knit in the round, and who understand that knitting is fun, and only consists of knitting, sometimes purling (altough elizabeth strongly discourages that - a necessary evil when ribbing), measuring and counting, thats it, simple, strongly recommend, and if you are a reader go on to her other earlier books.
B0001I561E|5.0|This is my favorite Disney animanted film, partly because (and as much as like Cinderella and Snow White) this story wasn't about the helpless female in rags waiting around for Prince Charming to come and sweep her off her feet. It was, in a way, just the opposite. The poor \\"street rat\\" finds \\"Princess Charming.\\" Robin Williams as the Genie was hiliarious and Jonathan Freeman did an excellent job voicing the villian and Gilbert Gottfried as his sidekick parrot. The special features include deleted songs and scenes; interviews with the voice talents, directors, animators and song composer Alan Menken. It takes you through the entire process of making the movie.
055357342X|5.0|George R.R. Martin's 'A Song of Ice & Fire' series has got to be one of the best fantasy series I have ever read.  Period.  It doesn't get any more concise than that, folks.  After a long and strenuous period of time, I've compiled a list of some of the things that I've noticed that sets Martin above most of today's fantasy writers (excluding R.A. Salvatore and Terry Brooks): <br /> <br />A Game of Thrones/A Clash of Kings/A Storm of Swords <br /> <br />- Brilliant introduction to a kingdom of the brink of destruction <br />- Wonderful description of the 7 major houses and their interactions (Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Arryn, Tully, Greyjoy, Tyrell), as well as various lesser houses (Martell, Frey, Bolton, Karstark, Florent, ect.) <br />- A direwolf for each Stark (and Snow) helps make the reader connect more deeply with the Starks than any other character throughout the series <br />- Marvelous crafting of characters you mean to sympathize with (Jon Snow, Bran), marvel at (Tyrion Lannister, Varys, Littlefinger, Jaime, Beric Dondarrion), feel parental connections to (Eddark, Cateyln, Davos), feel akward with (Stannis), hate (the Clegane brothers, Joffrey, Cersei, Lord Twyin, Viserys) and some you just want to strangle (that crazy Lysa Arryn, thank you Littlefinger!) <br />- Sets the stage for mayhem with the Stark/Baratheon/Lannister dynamic and with Bran's crippling <br />- Plot twists and turns in discovering the truth of Jon Arryn's death that you suspect but cannot truly grasp until its revelation <br />(DO NOT READ THE NEXT FEW LINES IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS) <br />- The death of Robert Baratheon AND Eddard Stark at the hands of Joffrey; Arya's shattered life in the wilderness; The countless campaigns and victories of Robb that end in betrayl at the hands of that old bastard Frey and Roose Bolton in the Red Wedding (did not see that coming!); the crusade for goodness and equality led by the invincible Beric Dondarrion; Daenery's blood-soaked trek acrossthe lands-with-no-map (only criticsm) that conclude (thus far) with Ser Jorah's dismissal; The coming of the frosty Others that instills fear inside even the reader; Jon Snow's exodus beyond the wall and Stannis (of all people!) coming to save the Wall from the wildlings ... all absolute plot genius <br /> <br />I am so pumped for the fourth installment, 'A Feast for Crows', and cannot wait to see what wonderful twists and turns the Seven Kingdoms will have to endure next.  With only Stannis and Daenerys left with a legitimate claim to the Iron Throne, will it be the stag with the heart of fire or the Targaryen dragons come-again that prove victorious in this World of Wonders? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00008QSA5|5.0|In 1968 \\"Super Session\\" helped take rock & roll to a whole new level. It pushed the envelope passed the 2 and 3 minute danceable pop songs, creating a longer more progressive rock pallet, paying more attention to technical and subtle aspects of the music. The three musicians that created the super group, Al Kooper (piano/organ/ondioline/vocals/guitars - Blood Sweat & Tears), Mike Bloomfield (guitar - Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", Electric Flag), and Stephen Stills (guitar - Crosby, Stills Nash [& Young], Buffalo Springfield), were all \\"on hiatus\\" from their most recent engagements. The three of them never actually played \\"together\\", instead it was split into sets of Kooper/Bloomfield and the other by Kooper/Stills. The band was backed by a powerful rhythm section as well, Harvey Brooks (bass - Miles Davis, Bob Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\") and Eddie Hoh (drums - The Monkees) as well as Barry Goldberg (electric piano - Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels, Electric Flag).<br /><br />The heavy Electric Chicago blues works beautifully on the Kooper/Bloomfield originals, \\"Albert's Shuffle\\", \\"Stop\\", and \\"Man's Temptation\\". The arrangements are precise, fluid and melodic. Kooper's organ solos provide a groovy melodic edge to the music. \\"Man's Temptation\\" is a very soulful number, reminiscent of Blood, Sweat & Tears. The 9 minute trippy waltz of \\"His Holy Modal Majesty\\" features the longest jam on the Kooper/Bloomfield side. The track also features Koopers electric keyboard-manipulated ondioline, sounding kind of like a tenor sax, although very unique.<br /><br />Due to health issues, Bloomfield was unable to finish the recording of \\"Super Session\\". This is where Steven Stills came in. He's first heard on a rendition of Bob Dylan's \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\". Still's biggest highlight on the album and a personal favorite of mine is \\"Season of the Witch\\". This 11 minute epic song displays the boiling chemistry Kooper and Stills have working together, offering inspired interaction between the two. \\"You Don't Love Me\\" allows Stills to play some heavy amplified distorted lead guitar, sounding a bit like Jimi Hendrix.<br /><br />This is one of those albums that age very well. Upon my first listen roughly a year ago, I was blown away at how fresh it sounded after all these years. It is unlike anything I've ever heard, offering influence in a big way to the Electric Chicago blues and rock and roll movement. I am very pleased to say that the remastered version of this album, done by Al Kooper himself, sounds awesome, loud and clear. That's something that fans of the original vinyl release will be anxious to snatch up.ogether, offering inspired interaction between the two. \\"You Don't Love Me\\" allows Stills to play some heavy amplified distorted lead guitar, sounding a bit like Jimi Hendrix. <br /> <br />This is one of those albums that age very well.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|The other reviews have basically hit upon the best points of the DVD, so I will not waste any more space. By far, the best recorded Dream Theater concert to date.
B000002UVX|5.0|After Hendrix broke up with the Experience in June of 1969, he teamed up with longtime friends Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums for his first and last authorized live recording, \\"Band Of Gypsys\\", recorded on New Years Eve 1969-1970. The recording was partially released in order to get Hendrix out from under a contractual obligation that he'd been plagued with for a couple of years earlier. Jimi's new rhythm section was vastly different from the Experience. Buddy Miles was an earthy, funky drummer in direct contrast to the busy, jazzy leanings of Mitch Mitchell.<br /><br />With a new rhythm section, Jimi was surrounded by new sense of creative freedom. He took advantage of these shows to unleash the new material he had been working on. The mix of rock, funk and R&B worked beautifully together, showing new lyrical direction on tunes like \\"Power to Love\\" and \\"Message to Love\\". Hendrix was on top of his game for these performances; perhaps his best ever. Jimi was known for his crazed on-stage presence (lighting the guitar on fire, playing with his teeth, etc.), but if you've ever seen footage of the concert, perhaps the \\"Band of Gypsys (Live at the Fillmore East) (1970)\\" DVD, you would notice a vast difference in his on-stage presence. Despite the grainy footage, Jimi is comfortable, focused and virtually motionless, resulting in the most riveting live performance unseen by \\"the Experience\\" fans.<br /><br />Equipment problems had plagued Hendrix in past live shows, but everything was working perfectly for the Filmore shows. \\"Who Knows?\\", one of my favs, is an amazingly inventive change, featuring Buddy Miles using his voice as the main instrument toward the end; and stands strong as the album's opener. There is nothing as groundbreaking on this album as the epic \\"Machine Gun\\", a protest song about Jimi's views on the Vietnam war. This was the first time Hendrix used the Fuzz Face, wah-wah pedal, Univibe, and Octavia pedals on stage together. Jimi creates bombs, guns, and other sounds of war from his guitar. \\"Machine Gun\\" is famous for it's groundbreaking guitar solo that rewrote the book on what one could do with an electric guitar. Watching footage of Jimi play the solo as he channels all his energy and focus into his guitar playing, with closed eyes, once again remaining nearly motionless, is a truly mesmerizing experience in itself; much like the earlier years of Jim Morrison playing with The Doors.<br /><br />\\"Band Of Gypsys\\" also features 2 great compositions from Buddy Miles, but the show belongs to Hendrix. Jimi really showed what he was really capable of during these live performance without \\"the Experience\\". \\"Band Of Gypsys\\" is arguably Jimi's finest album ever, not to mention the greatest live album ever recorded.ombs, guns, and other sounds of war from his guitar. \\"Machine Gun\\" is famous for it's groundbreaking guitar solo that rewrote the book on what one could do with an electric guitar.

0425200469|4.0|After reading for the first 100 pages and no murder having occurred, I was wondering if I was reading Agatha Christie or not.  Alas, you can relax, a murder was to occur eventually.  Having just read Murder on the Orient Express just prior to Death on the Nile, I found the two strikingly similar when juxtaposed together: both involve murders on a boxcar traveling with an eclectic, if not bizarre, group of travelers...and of course the intrepid Hercule Poirot to solve the mystery and make the world right.  Good stuff.<br /><br />\\"But thank God, there is happiness in the world.\\"<br />- Mrs. Allerton at the finale
038572179X|5.0|That's what this book is. Why is that I can't forget Briony? Is it because I was her? Maybe... <br /> <br />Iwan McEwan has this gifted approach in putting down words in exquisite fashion that so reminds me of Maugham... a must read.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|and actually composing this review in my bathroom. That's what these movies do for me. They bring out stuff that's been stopping me up. Ok the effects are nice, but Carrie Anne Moss has to go and Keanu looks very unhealthy. He should become a meatatarian so he looks heathlier.
0783225857|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird was originally a novel written by Harper Lee.  The movie, while not as good as the book, was still very interesting.  The story takes place in the Southern United States at a time when racism was still a very common sight.  Atticus Finch, a lawyer, is a single parent and tries to raise his children, Jem and Scout, with the same good morals and values that he holds close.  Atticus ends up defending an African American who was wrongfully accused of rape by a white female.  The story is one in which all the characters are able to learn something new about themselves as well as life.  I found the entire movie to be very intersting and it held my attention the whole time.  I think we can all learn something from the experiences of the characters in the movie To Kill A Mockingbird.  I highly recommend this movie to others.-Christina <br />
B00000099Y|4.0|I got into Tool back in 1996 when this was released, having not heard a single song, and this was my first buy.  <br />It immediately struck me as a dense, impenetrable monster of an album that, while heavy and intricate was for one reason or another, instantly accessible (in parts). Stinkfist, Eulogy, 46&2, and Aenima all struck me upon first listen as having undeniable potential. So, I stuck with this dark and often weird album. I should probably state that I am into a wide range of music. I love Van Morrison, Pearl Jam, Springsteen, The Stones, Deftones, Pete Yorn, Dave Matthews etc etc and I grew up on bands like Machines Head, Korn, Metallica, Pantera etc. <br />This album transcended all the genres at the time and still ranks as one of the best rock albums of the last 10 years.  <br />It is hard to get into it all, but it is a stunning work. In my opinion, their best work by far. Lateralus never did it for me, and Undertow was too patchy to work to this extent. <br />If you want heavy music that is melodically and topically accessible that creates vivid images that we can all slip away into then this is a definite must for your collection. Being a drummer I was always taken by Carey's broad range and exceptional abilities, and the same can be said for all the members and their respective instruments. <br />A beautiful, heavy, meaningful, political, weird, morose, thick album that you should at least give the time to listen to once.
0061015725|3.0|I was not impressed with this book. I've been a long time fan of Michael Crichton, but recently his books have not been that great. I thought he was at his best when his subjects were science and medicine, so I had high hopes for Prey. Unfortunately, the first third of the book was mind-numbingly boring (and NOT suspenseful. Everything was foreshadowed so much that you'd have to be a monkey not to pick up on it). When the action finally got going, it was inconsistent and outrageous. Instead of this book, I would recommend some of Crichton's older novels, such as Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Sphere, and Congo (don't let the horrible movie versions affect your enjoyment of these excellent books). I think Airframe is good as well.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|If I had judged the album only from the singles I would have never got this album. I am glad I took a chance and got it. This album is packed with full of excellent rock vibe. She is for sure valedictorian among Alanis-school rockers.<br /><br />On the whole the album direction got closer to that of Evanescence's Fallen, favorable move because I love the album a lot. FORGOTTEN and TOGETHER particularly has well-polished melancholism some of the current rockers such as Evanescence and Harem Scarem are well capable of. And this is another excellent bridge between classic melodic rock and modern rock just as the aforementioned bands successfully had achieved.<br /><br />Yet you can still find excellent power pop tracks the debut had such as HE WASN'T, MY HAPPY ENDING, HOW DOES IT FEEL, and WHO KNOWS. Personally, however, I would like to dig into rockier side of her more. It's been the heavy rotated CD ever since I have bought this album. For sure one of the year's best.<br /><br />Recommended for wide range of music lovers.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|you know Michael Jackson truly did something incredible in 3 phases of His career. first starting out as a Member of the Jackson 5&also as a Adult Member of the Jacksons&we aren''t even gonna talk about His Greatness as a Solo Artist.this is a truly Ultimate Collection of the Jacksons Work on Motown through sony. you gotta get this ASAP if you are a Jacksons Fan.
B000000W5P|5.0|This is the last great Stones album as many have noted.  After this one they're all a let down.  For the uninitiated, buy this one, Let It Bleed, Beggars Banquet and Exile On Main Street. There are some other good albums (Sticky Fingers) but Some Girls and the other ones I mentioned are what made the Rolling Stones legendary.  After Some Girls they started riding on that reputation and never quite lived-up to the hype again.  Sorry Stones fans but a new album and tour by the Stones is like a visit to Jurassic Park.  Dinosaurs no longer rule the earth.
B00005JNEI|5.0|If you've not yet seen this movie, please watch it ASAP. Some may say this is leftist propaganda and that Michael Moore \\"hates America\\", but they couldn't be farther from the truth. Michael Moore isn't a democrat or a republican and he works to expose the wrongdoings of BOTH parties (he certainly didn't exclude President Clinton). <br />Michael Moore loves this country and it clearly shows in all his work. From his first documentary, \\"Roger and Me\\", that tells the story of GM closing their plant in Flint, Michigan to open factories abroad to \\"Bowling for Columbine\\", a documentary that explores the culture of fear and violence in our country; He is a purveyor of truth and an advocate for change.  <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is no different. Moore doesn't just spew out liberal opinions on the Bush administration and Iraq, he shows you footage and documents that the rest of the news conveniently leave out. A great example of this is the footage of George W. Bush's induction day. Moore shows the huge protests that went on that day in DC - like no other presidential induction ceremony in history.  The media didn't inform us of this. And there are many other examples. The ties between the Bush family and the Saudi Arabians also come as quite a shocker. The footage is there for you to see.  <br />Whether you are democrat, republican, green, or independent - see this movie. Don't let the \\"faux\\" news channel or a partisan reviewer form your opinions. Form your own!

6303686796|5.0|This is one of those milestone films in America cinema about which millions of words have been written, and everybody who's anybody in filmdom has seen. It received a mixed reception when it appeared twenty-eight years ago, and of course the Academy did not reward it.<br /><br />Taxi Driver remains a difficult movie to evaluate. On the one hand there can be no doubt about the brilliance of Martin Scorsese's direction in which he makes excruciatingly real the street level life of a taxicab driver in the big city. Harsh, multi-hued lighting of predatory street scenes, the cheap, bleak interior of the taxi driver's apartment, the vacuous phrases and promises of the politician, the brutality of guns and knives, the sordidness of things left in the backseat of cabs, and the gritty litter of the streets have the effect of immersing us into the cabby's world. Nor can there be any doubt about the brilliance of Robert De Niro in the title role. He portrays the alienated, misfitted psychotic mentality of Vietnam vet Joshua Bickle poignantly, compellingly, and with a larger than life lividity. Jodie Foster is the very essence of a post-sixties flower child morphed into a twelve and a half year old prostitute. Her childlike ability to find sustenance amid the objective horror of her life compelled our sympathy. Foster's flawless projection of the little girl's pathetic street-wise facade rightfully catapulted her to national attention. Cybill Shepherd was also excellent as a post-Kennedy era political strawberry, and Harvey Keitel was very good as the sleazy pimp, as was Peter Boyle as a cabby philosopher.<br /><br />On the other hand, the stagy blood splashing toward the end, and the lingering thereon, seemed a little cheap, as though Scorsese did not have complete faith in his production and thought a violence fix was needed to satisfy his audience. Also the fantasy ending in which the unlikely happens like a cartoon joke seemed a contrivance from someone not sure about the import of his movie. The scene in which Cybill Shepherd enters De Niro's empty cab, seemingly to entice him, plays at first like a fantasy, but after he deposits her on the curb, we know it is supposed to be real. Incidentally, the fact that he doesn't notice her until he sees her in his rearview mirror, although he walked up to the cab with her in it, suggests something hurriedly dreamed up during production as a quick commentary on what has gone before.<br /><br />Nonetheless the ending is transcended because Scorsese had a great movie all along, with outstanding acting and a compelling story artfully shot, leading to a socially-conscience experience vividly reflecting the disillusionment of post sixties America.he import of his movie.

B00005JLEX|4.0|Aaaa, as to the those that complain about the show  being indifferent toward others' well-being - That's the joke! There was even an episode that addressed this premise where all the characters ended up in prison because of their indifference as Kramer filmed a fat man being mugged and the \\"gang\\" just stood around making commentary.  <br /> <br />That's the beauty and cleverness of the show; it pokes fun at people's indifference towards each other while showing the neurotic side of human nature. Those of you that have lived in a \\"big city\\" will definitely understand this. It will leave you saying \\"I can't believe he/she just said or did that!\\" It's a jovial poke at the 80's-90's yuppie/slacker over-analytical crowd. <br /> <br />Warning!!! If you are not into dark/black comedy, don't buy these sets. On the other hand if you are, happy Festivus!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I have played it over and over and don't get tired of it. There is so much talent on this one CD that it nearly blows your mind. I highly recommend it.
6305127646|1.0|I've read that Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue rewrote parts of the film because they apparently had a better grasp of their characters.  They should never be handed a crayon again as long as they live. <br /> <br />The films borders on moronic and juvenile and never attempts to reach higher.  Elizabeth Shue as a fusion scientist provides some comic relief but not nearly enough.  Val Kilmer delves into the Saint as though he is trying to fulfill a contract and ensure there will be no sequels.   <br /> <br />The script borrows from the best of the bargain bin.  There are no attempts to bring intrigue or even concern to the screen as these characters wander aimlessly from one scene to the next. <br /> <br />I cannot even express my distaste for the finale where Elizabeth Shue delivers an important scientific briefing while Val hams it up in the audience.  This scene alone sums up everything wrong in modern film. <br /> <br />I know that this will lie among glowing reviews of this same film on Amazon's website.  My only advice is if you find movies like \\"Independance Day\\", \\"Matthew Broderick's Godzilla\\", and \\"Steven Seagal's Fire Down Below\\" (I put some names before the titles because I believe actors should be held accoutable), then you'll love this fun-filled romp through European espionage.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I really enjoyed some of Michael Moore's other works. However he now seems on a vendetta against Bush. He's not even going to let little things like the facts or the truth get in his way.... <br />Listen if you hate bush you'll love this movie, However if you actually spend some time checking the fact's you'll see that Moore's movie is more fantasy than reality. <br />Oh and Please stop wearing that MSU hat your giving us spartans a bad name... Why not wear a U of M hat instead????
B00005JNEI|5.0|If you have rated this movie with one star, chances are you haven't even seen it.

Chances are you also still belive that Iraq has WMDs and was planning to attack.
B00003CWN2|5.0|This movie really made me think about sexual differences and what it means to have a sex change or to want one, or to be trapped in a gender you don't want. It was very effective to have us see Hilary Swank (who plays Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon) with short hair and male facial expressions and gestures without giving us a glimpse of her as Teena. (Actually we did get a brief glimpse in a photo.) Swank looks like a boy, acts like a boy, in fact works hard to be a boy; indeed that is (sadly) part of what this movie is about, what it means to be a boy in middle America as opposed to being a girl. And then when we have the scene with the tampons and the breast wrapping and we see her legs, the effect is startling, an effect possibly lost on those who knew that the person playing Brandon was a woman. It was when I saw her legs and could tell at a glance that she was a woman with a woman's legs that I realized just how subtle, but unmistakable are the anatomical sexual differences, and how convincing Swank's portrayal was.<br /><br />I was reminded as I watched this of being a young person, of being a teenager and going through all the rituals and rites, unspoken, unplanned, without social sanction, that we all go through to prove our identity, because that is what Brandon was so eager to do, to prove his identity as a boy. I thought, ah such an advantage he has with the girls because he knows what they like and what they want. He can be smooth, and how pretty he looks. It was strange. I actually knew some guys in my youth who had such talent, and the girls did love them.<br /><br />The direction by Kimberly Peirce is nicely paced and the forebodings of horror to come are sprinkled lightly throughout so that we don't really think about the resolution perhaps until the campfire scene in which John Lotter shows his self-inflicted scars and tosses the knife to Brandon. Then we know for sure that something bad is going to happen.<br /><br />Hilary Swank is very convincing. Her performance is stunning, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress. She is the type of tomboy/girl so beloved of the French cinema, tomboyish, but obvious a girl like, for example, Zouzou as seen in Chloe in the Afternoon (1972) or Elodie Bouchez in the The Dreamlife of Angels (1998), or many others. Indeed, one is even reminded of Juliette Binoche, who of course can play anything, or going way back, Leslie Caron in Gigi (1958). Chloe Signvey, who plays Lana Tisdel, the girl Brandon loves, whom I first saw in Palmetto (1998), where she stole a scene or two from Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue, really comes off ironically as butch to Swank, yet manages a sexy, blue collar girl next door femininity. She also does a great job. Peter Sarsgaard is perfect as John Lotter, trailer trash car thief and homophobic redneck degenerate.<br /><br />Very disturbing is the ending. If you know the story, you know the ending. Just how true this was to the real life story it is based on is really irrelevant. I knew nothing about the story, but I know that film makers always take license to tell it the way they think it will play best, and so it's best to just experience the film as the film, independent of the real story, which, like all real stories, can never be totally told.<br /><br />Obviously this is not for the kiddies and comes as close to an \\"X\\" rating as any \\"R\\" movie you'll ever see. It will<br />make most viewers uncomfortable, but it is the kind of story that needs to be told.g, and she deserved the Academy Award she won for Best Actress.

0811826848|5.0|Published a year before George Harrison's death, \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" (2000) is not a revisionist whitewash in comparison to the 1995 video and audio versions of the Fab Four's archival project. The group's autobiographical effort is a compelling and, at times, poignant read - with a treasure trove of never-before-seen photographs and artwork. There have been numerous biographies and critical studies on the group, yet the British quartet's story is doubly fascinating when the members have their say on the subject. Harrison, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr have followed the late John Lennon's \\"warts and all\\" approach in discussing their Beatle past. For all the fame, wealth and plaudits the group received, one also senses the burden placed on each member. Regardless of the mixed emotions, the Beatles succeed in placing their remarkable legacy in its proper perspective. This aspect alone makes \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" a valuable work.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I've now read a bunch of the reviews and my conclusion is that you are a bunch of weenees.  I took the time to do it because I'm enjoying the album regardless of whether it's \\"legit\\" or not...  Just so you know I'm an aging post-punk alternative, yeah..yeah.. bs.  So, this whole discussion about derivative is particularly interesting to me.  The music, melody and arrangement are really good, clever, and well-put-together, and yes derivative  ----- and I know it.  The fun part is that you all have named 40 bands this group sounds like and that is the genius of it.  Pop is about twists and turns not radical departures...a radical departure would be....say Jazz...not pop.. <br /> <br />Yes, I hear Gang of Four guitars all through it. Very noticable and I bet they wouldn't deny it.  Cheating on You is actually Damaged Goods.   Auf Aushe could be New Order.... But, so what....the fact the band has made you think about all those notable bands makes you like them more doesn't it.  What they have done is actually really hard to do friends.  That Blur album was the same thing, you could walk through it and name the bands BeatleBum was the Beatles, etc.... Enjoy it don't criticize it mates!  The band is reading all this and laughing..
B00003CXCT|4.0|When all the red-hot emotions over O-OT vs. changes cooled down, one might wonder that on the long run what did this set contribute to the legacy of Star Wars... <br />I followed this topic for the last 6 months or so, so this is what I filtered down: <br />1. Van Ling, the famous producer of the DVD menus, did an absolutely amazing job, he (and his team) not only deserves 5 stars for this, but much more! This alone makes this set worthwhile. <br />2. At this point it is obvious that the release of this set was rushed and there were some compromises, that hit ANH the worst: the colors in this movie are royally screwed up. You all know about the sound issues, already. You all know about the freezing/skipping problem already. I simply cannot imagine, that GL, this BIG EGO is happy with the result. The question is whether or not he is going to do something about this. I would personally welcome a corrected version of the ANH disc (alone) made available for those who care. We'll see. <br />Other than the first movie, the sharpness and disappearance of VHS/Laserdisc effects make Ep. V-VI. a rather pleasant and refreshing experience. <br />3. The extras are interesting, and they are not going to be repeated on an ultimate version, so again, a worthwhile purchase. <br /> <br />Van Ling: 5 stars <br />George Lucas : 1 star for continuous tweaking and allowing the release of an unfinished, half-made, screwed-up restoration of ANH <br />ILM: 3 stars for the effort <br />Documentary crew: 4 stars for the nice featurettes <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|Like about 80% of the people on here, I believe this was a good, well-done, eye-opening movie. Alot of republicans dont like it just because Michael Moore is a fat, liberal, mofo. Well DUH, didn't you realize that from the previews. <br /> <br />I think that Moore did a good job on his theories about Bush and his administration, but even if you're a liberal against Bush....just remember to take Moore with a big grain of salt. I have heard the part about flying the Bin-Ladens out of the country was proved false by Moore's own source...not that moore doesnt have a point, he just ISNT the man who should have done the film. He has been known to only take one part of a fact and warp it to his benefit. This ruins his original goal ; to convince swing voters to help bush lose the election. But republicans / swing voters decide not to believe a thing moore says, just because michael moore is michael moore. <br /> <br />Remember moore's points, but just take them with a grain of salt, and do your research. There are other ways to prove why people dont like bush other than this movie.
B00005J6UP|5.0|*SPOILER* I really love this movie.  Don't get me wrong it rocks, but the new DVD that has the \\"deleted scenes\\" is a total rip-off.  Those scenes were never deleted they were actual scenes from the original which have since been cut.  I have an old copy and the octopus scene has always been in the movie.  They re-released the movie after cutting out several crucial scenes like the one when they figure out that the coin is actually a map of their own coastline- I mean when you cut that out, how did they ever discover where to look?  Dumb luck?  And if the octopus scene wasn't originally in it, then they did a bad cutting job because at the end when they are all reunited on the beach why are people yelling \\"And the giant octopus...!\\"  I am soooo disappointed in this DVD because it punches holes in a movie I love.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House is a hilarious film about the delta fraternity on the campus of Faber College. Watching these charactors pull crazy stunts and getting away with anything they want was both entertaining and funny. The first time watching this film was the semester before I started college and this film made me grasp a different view on college life that I did not already know. I believe that this film is a classic and I recommend it to anybody, especially someone that is going to college because besides all the drinking and what goes on in the \\"Animal House,\\" these charactors are generally funny, each having a special trait about them that makes you think of somebody that you know. This movie set a stereotype to all college fraternitys, and I believe that that is both good and bad. One thing is for sure, after watching this movie, I made sure I joined a fraternity not only for the parties, but mainly for the freindship I saw in the movie between the charactors. I recommend this movie to anybody. You'll be on the floor laughing and you'll see what I mean.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|It just may be.  Dream Theater outdid themselves with this one. I was expecting something great, but this just blew my mind...    The show itself:  The show is amazing. At 2 hours and 50 minutes, it's a thrill all the way through. They play songs from just about every album (except Awake). Alot of the more recent songs were played. 5 songs from 'Train Of Thought', and 5 songs from 'Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence' were played. They even brought out \\"Only A Matter Of Time\\" from 'When Dream And Day Unite\\", which is one of the highlights of the show. \\"In The Name Of God\\" was the PERFECT closer. For the end of the show, it was so filled with emotion, power and pure raw energy. Disappear was another highlight. Pure Emotion, played wonderfully, and better than the recorded version. Jordan's keyboard solo was excellent, quite different from his older solos. The 'Instrumedley' was an awesome song, cool they pulled it out for this DVD. Hollow Years with the extended solo is so much better than the album version, the solo is just so great, and the whole song played live is a treat to listen to/watch. And finally, the 'Beyond This Life' jam. Wow. Wow is the only word. Incredible how great it was, I cant think of ways to describe it, just watch it. Definately their best recorded show to date. The Japanese crowd, as usual, is pretty quiet except for at the begining and end of songs. The Budokan is huge, and has to be the biggest venue they've played an 'Evening With' show, and it's great they caught it on tape.    The sound:  Now, here lies the problem. There was a production glitch, in which at the halfway mark, when the layer changes at 1:00 into New Millenium, the 5.1 audio malfunctions. The sub channel moves to the left rear speaker, and everything gets messed up. This is a problem on all the copies.  The 2.0 Stereo however, is excellent. The mix is done very well by Kevin Shirley, much better than the 'Live Scenes From New York' mix. Overall, excluding the 5.1 glitch, the sound is very well done.    The packaging:  I love it. Looks sturdy, the artwork is great, and the discs are held in well.    The Bonus Features:  There's a 30 minute documentary on the Japanese leg of the 'Train Of Thought' tour, which is really nice. It has interviews, soundchecks, and other very entertaining bits. The Keyboard and Guitar world parts are excellent, and informative. The drum solo was alright, the reason I still watch it is because Mike brought two guys up on stage to play with him, which was cool. There's a multi angle version of the 'Instrumedley'. Awesome to watch each of the members during the song, even see them prepare before hand! Finally, the video the band put on before every show is on here. 'The Dream Theater Chronicles. 1985-2004'. It's a nice litte video package that showcases Dream Theater's entire career.    The Video Quality:  WOW!  Best looking concert DVD I have EVER seen. It looks like it was shot on film (24FPS) and not on video (30fps) like the 'Metropolis 2000 dvd'. It was shot like it was a full fledged movie. The camera angles, the cinematography, it's all just amazing. This is where DT really went all out.     In all, every DT fan needs this. And if you're not a fan, get this and you will be. It's definately DT's best.  10/10 by me.
B000002J09|4.0|Black Dog- Awesome, sing along lyrics and great jams 5/5 <br /> <br />Rock and Roll- a classic, impossible to hate, man, the opening guitar is worth the $15 for the whole album 5/5 <br /> <br />Battle of Evermore- My favorite led zeppelin is when they depart from catchy rock like \\"rock and roll\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hops\\" but this time, they don't do anything particularly great 3/5 <br /> <br />Stairway to Heaven- epic, not just the best song on this album, or the best song by Led Zeppelin, but the greatest song in rock history 5/5 <br /> <br />Misty Mountain Hops- a great song, would be 5/5 but it signifies the change from blues/hard rock visionaries to pop success, and for that alone, it goes down down a notch to 4/5 <br /> <br />Four Sticks- great song, and different from anything that they had ever done before 4/5 <br /> <br />Goin' to California- Good Folk song 4/5 <br /> <br />When the Levee Breaks- Spectacular, great way to end the album, lets you know that led's still got it 5/5 <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Since the release of Dookie in 1994, Green Day has established itself as a strong name in the alternative/pop punk genre. As the years went on, Green Day slowly began to mature in the songwriting department, moving from angsty punk to more of a classic approach (namely Warning). However, the band's newest release, American Idiot, proves to be a mix of old and new, and is clearly the best of both worlds.     With a strong political statement, such as the title song's lyrics, \\"Maybe I am the faggot America,\\" fans must be reminded to take everything with a grain of salt, for nothing is said without a sense of irony. While Green Day may come off as returning to its angsty teenage years, American Idiot should not be taken at face value and certainly hits home in its society criticism.      The album is referred to by some as a rock opera, as it often mentions a character of \\"Jimmy\\", and there are very few breaks between songs on the whole album. It can definitely be inferred that American Idiot follows a theme and even a story, as we take a cynical look at the world around us through a catchy 13 tracks. From the hard, fast-paced title song American Idiot, to the classic-rock style of Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, to the rock ballad Wake Me Up When September Ends, there is definitely something for everyone on Green Day's seventh (main) and newest album.     Whether you are an old fan, a newcomer, or even if you dislike the band altogether, there is no doubting that the songwriting ability on American Idiot is arguably the best yet for Green Day. For a band that's notorious for its simplistic riffs, American Idiot will pleasantly surprise and keep your finger on the repeat button.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I usually do not review metal albums. I would rather pick at the country fans and make fun of their favorite bands. This album and style of music is different though. I worked in a small independant record store in the early 90's. I made it a place to hang around after graduating college. I can remember a few years ago listening to a group of teenagers argue about, Slipknot, Mudvayne and Mushroomhead. Then there was an older guy there that said that none of these bands were metal. First, this is metal, so is Mudvayne, so is Mushroomhead and all the other bands that have been labeled Nu-Metal. Even Korn and The Disturbed. The fact that there are no solos doesn't warrant making a new genre. This band has the same rage that Slayer had. Sure the lyrics are cheesy at times but did we forget the old Slayer songs and those pictures from the inserts of Tom Araya holding and upside down cross looking like Alice Cooper? This is metal and I think it's impressive. I don't know these guys names or numbers but I know Corey. He impresses me with the different vocal styles. So to all the old metal fans who bash this cd, take it from me, a fan of Saint Vitus, Anniahlator, huge fan of Slayer, give these guys a few listens. Look at it this way, it's better then J-Kwon or whatever. At least there are guitars in it. These guys are Slayer to kids today. They are everything that goes against conventional music. Try it with an open mind.

B0002Z0EYA|4.0|TROY is the latest instalment of big budget semi-fictional period action epic to take the world's cinemas by storm. Great picks of two contemporary Hollywood's most bankable hearthrobs (Brad Pitt, Orlando Bloom), a must-have intactly beautiful new-face model (Diane Kruger), plus some respectable elders (Peter O'Toole, Julie Christie, Brian Cox), the long awaited film had had thousands of millions of movie fans drooling over the trailer all months long as wet as over the poster outside the long queues - which leaves you wonder whether it's a loyal question of the mysterious Greek history, the sun-kissed open lands and wide seas, or is it simply for the sake of the beefcake warriors?!<br /><br />For me, I enjoy every bit of the film in its ever gold-brushed tones: Prince Paris (Bloom) bedding Queen Helen of Spartan (Kruger), an instant slash-down of Troy's giant by Spartan warrior Achilles (Pitt), a life battle of Achilles and Prince Hector of Troy (a gym polished Eric Bana), the brave intrusion of King Priam (O'Toole) to Achilles' camp for the body of his dead son Prince Hector, and a touching moment when Achilles placing coins upon his cousin's funeral. Not forget to mention a full bareback Pitt in his top 40-year old status.<br /><br />For TROY, like it or not, you can't deny that the sex sells some.
B00006RINF|5.0|When it comes to a great metal band with a woman's touch on the mic, Lacuna Coil are one of those bands that do so. Frontwomen Christina Scabbia has a voice that is so dreamy. Comalies is such a wonderful album that gives the band that gothic-metal sound which is so wonderfull atmospheric. One con is that this album can be a bit hard to get into if you're a die-hard headbanger like myself, but I like it alot. Best songs are Heaven's A Lie, and Daylight Dancer. Great album, but it now.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Musical perfection here. <br /> <br />Where Eagles Dare - Of course, taken from the Clint Eastwood movie in the 60's.  Great movie, great song. <br /> <br />Revelations -  Starts slow, ends up great. <br /> <br />Flight of Icarus - The complete story of Icarus and him crashing into the sea put to Heavy Hard Rock.  Great singing from Bruce on this song. <br /> <br />Die with your Boots on -  (Actually, Sonta Arctica made a faster heavier version of this song), still, this song from MAIDEN is a classic.  Catchy chorus part to this song too.  Great singing from Bruce on this one too. <br /> <br />The Trooper -  MAIDEN greatest hit here.  You can't go wrong with this song.  Awesome guitar solo.  There is no chorus part at all to this song.  The guitars ARE the chorus. <br /> <br />Still Life -  Kind of a creepy song.  One of the few songs that Davey Murrary wrote.  A guy sees ghosts at the bottom of a pool, and he is lured in by it and addicted to it. <br /> <br />Quest for Fire -  Many people say that this song is boo-awful.  It really isn't all that bad if you listen to it a few times over.  The chorus part is really catchy. <br /> <br />Sun and Steel -  Awesome song, but many people think that this song is so boo-awful as well.  The guitar solo of this song is similar to \\"Total Eclipse\\" on \\"The # of the Beast\\" CD.  Very catchy chorus part.  The song is talking about a samurai. <br /> <br />To Tame A Land -  \\"Dune\\" from Frank Herbert put to music.  Enough said.  Great guitar work in this song too.  About a 8 minute song. <br /> <br /> <br />If someone likes \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"7th Son\\", then DEFINITELY buy this CD today. <br /> <br />Worth every dime.  One of MAIDEN's best CDs. <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|3.0|OK, it was a summer flick and it was an SFX fest.  The plot, that did exist, was medicore.  It was actually pretty danged funny.  First, the plot that global climate change was entirely the fault of the US is implausible.  How much emissions do Russia, China, and other omit?  And could Emmerich have exaggarated this anymore.  Nobel Prize winners said it would take thousands of years for this event to happen, not a few weeks, like the film.  Second, the US Administration went from cool in ID4 to untrustworthy in Godzilla, to incompetent in Day After Tomorrow.  This is laughable as The President (Blake or Bush) was playing golf when a blizzard hit.  I bet someone screened Fahrenheit 911 when planning this screen play.  The Vice President Cheney clone was an idiot and passive.  The real Cheney yells eat s--t, like the jibjab.com cartoon.  The President dies and no one is sad.  Wow, could we get more political.  Third, the priorities of the people are best shown when the astronauts on the space station look down and see ice cover Europe, N America, and parts of Asia.  One astronaut just says- \\"Wow, it's so much cleaner now.\\"  Hey, weren't your families down there?  Wasn't the ice covering any of the shuttle launching areas and landing strips?  You idiots are going to die up there!  And you say- Wow, it's clean.  Idiots.  This movie would have been fine, had Al Gore not endorsed this, like he did Howard Dean.  We know where Dean is now, probably serving popcorn at the movie plex.  If you are looking for a deep plotted film and deep moral implications, you are barking up the wrong tree.  If you're looking for a summer flick and political farce, then enjoy!
0812550706|4.0|A very good book.  I found Ender's psychological stress to be very  realistic, and truly felt for him. <br /> <br />There are only two problems with this book.  First of all, Mr. Card, you fail to distinguish between intellegence and creativity (creative people tend to have higher than average IQs, of about 120, but many geniuses lack creativity, and vice versa), although Ender was obviously both (which does sometimes happen). <br /> <br />The other problem is that the genius strategies are mostly limited by the fact that the author is NOT a genius.  They're not dumb, they're intellegent, but when you have an entire battle school of geniuses at work I believe you'd do better than \\"in space any direction can be up\\". <br /> <br />Beyond that, the book is pure classic.
B00005JNEI|4.0|I have never written a review before, but felt moved after reading some of the more negative reviews of this film. Here is my criticisms of the film: Moore's use of footage of Iraq before the war of being an idealic place.  The segment on the \\"Coiliton of the Willing\\" depicting very stereotype images of the countries. <br />However, I don't understand the reviews that totally discount Moore's film being a bunch of lies. When Moore uses clips of the president saying  dangerous statements such as \\"Bring it on\\", he is not lying. When he presents the mother of a soldier who has died he is not lying. I was happy to see Moore step away from these segments to let the mother tell her story.  Letting someone share there stories, feelings and experience, especially one that we rarely have the opportunity to hear is not exploitative. The woman at the end of the movie that tells the grieving mother not to believe the protesting woman, that \\"this is all staged\\" reminds me of the negative reviews. The greiving mother tells the skeptical woman that her son died in the war and she discounts it by saying, \\"well a lot of people have died\\". Some people in this country want to believe something so bad that they will say something is a lie even when it is it in their face. Everyone take the time to watch this film so that you can wake up. You don't even have to believe all the assertions that Moore comes up with but please give it a chance. For me this movie was a release.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|Very good CD, but not Nightwish's best CD. <br /> <br />But don't get me wrong, Nightwish does not make bad music. <br /> <br />All of their CDs are worth buying. <br /> <br /> <br />Imagine this CD being a heavier \\"Century Child\\" CD, and many of the songs on this CD having a full orchastra sound and full concert choir singing and the guitars and drumming sounding a tad heavier than \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" on the \\"Century Child\\" CD, and you got \\"Once\\" CD from Nightwish.   (Ms. Tarja's voice is still as beautiful as ever). <br /> <br />\\"Planet Hell\\" is one of these \\"Slaying the Dreamer\\" type of songs on this CD, but man is it catchy and will get you singing to it in no time. <br /> <br /> <br />Some of the songs on here sounds like a soundtrack from a movie:  \\"Ghost Love Score\\" especially. <br /> <br />But, just to hear \\"Ghost Love Score\\" is worth the price of this CD. <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Love Score\\" =  10 minutes of musical perfection. <br /> <br />  <br />One song on here is sung in Finish.  \\"Death Makes An Artist\\" translated in English.   You might not understand what Ms. Tarja is signing in this song, but the song and the signing voice is beautiful.  It is a slow acoustic song with a cello and violins playing in this song too. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Live to Tell The Tale\\" and \\"White Night Fanasty\\" are 2 extra songs on this CD that were really B-side songs on the \\"Nemo parts 1 and 2\\" singles in Europe. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Live to Tell the Tale\\" out-right ROCKS!!!! <br /> <br />\\"White Night Fanasty\\" takes a listen or 2 to get used to.  Ms. Tarja sounds like a little girl singing that song.  But still beautiful singing though. <br /> <br /> <br />So overall:  This CD is the American version of the European import CD.  This CD is on the Roadrunner Record Label  (Same record label with nu-metal bands like Slipknot, although Nightwish is NOT nu-metal.  Go figure?)  Anyways, this CD has potential to be huge in the U.S.  It is already huge all over Europe.  #1 CD in many European countries right now. <br /> <br />If you support Nightwish, just as I do, and if you want to see this band get big here in America, or if you are just looking for really good Symphony Movie Soundtrack Metal; GET THIS CD.
6305508550|3.0|This movie is wonderful, as you can read in the reviews below. If you've ever worked in an office, this is a must see. <br /> <br />My problem? The DVD. Virtually no special features. For such a cult classic, the fans really need a special edition DVD. I guess I will just have to wait and read my office's latest memos until a better version comes out.
B00005JL96|4.0|This movie has the best portayal of family values that I have seen in a movie.  It shows the importance of staying together to achieve what is best.  The only thing that I found disturbing was that the sister always seemed to be away. No wonder Lilo got into so much trouble, she really did not have very much self control. I also think that the little girls had  way to mature attitudes about who could be thier friend and not it just did not seem real to me.
B0001FR3IQ|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  No movie has made me feel so trapped?!  This movie is not for the light-hearted, there are many pop-ups and they occure when you least expect it.  This is one of the reasons I enjoyed the movie so much. Some scary movies just aren't that scary anymore, but \\"Gothika\\" got under my skin. <br /> <br />Halle Berry played an amazing role in this movie.  She had a great set of co-stars also, like: Penlope Cruz, Robert Downey Jr., and Charles Dutton.  The relationships in the movies, at first, were confusing but as the movie progressed they all fell into place. <br /> <br />I would see this movie if you are looking for a good scare or just to see another great movie by Halle Berry.  All in all the movie was great!  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in being a little frightenend.  If you do decide to watch this movie, ENJOY!
B00005A0N5|5.0|\\"Oceanborn\\" pretty much is the essential Nightwish CD, and if you want to start to listen to and get into Nightwish's music, this is the CD to start with. <br /> <br />Not a bad song on the whole CD.  One of those types of CDs that you could listen to a million times in a row and never get tired of. <br /> <br />You really don't even know that there are other songs on this CD, because you listen to the first 4 or 5 songs so much. <br /> <br />(Yep, I am a die-hard Nightwish fan). <br /> <br /> <br />Awesome piano and keyboard playing from Tumoas. <br /> <br />Awesome double bass kick drumming from Jukka. <br /> <br />Awesome guitar playing skills from Emppu. <br /> <br />This was before Marco came in the band, but the bassist before Marco came is really good. <br /> <br />Ms. Tarja, as always, is heavenly and beautiful with the opera-style singing on this CD. <br /> <br /> <br />Enya put to Metal music that is SO powerful and driving = Nightwish. <br /> <br /> <br />I can't actually say that there is a best song on this CD. <br /> <br />No bad songs to begin with. <br /> <br /> <br />European Metal at its best.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|So laid back and relaxed with tunes you can whistle while sitting on the front veranda bare foot.Knopfler has always been and continues to be nothing less than amazing.
B000023X9W|2.0|This is a very mellow album by Young which features some nice vocals and guitar work in generally minimalist arrangements.  In sound, it's somewhat reminiscent of \\"Harvest Moon\\", which I thought was easily superior.    The problem here is simply that the songs aren't very good.  All are originals, some have been played in his stage shows for years without going on to CD, but I didn't find even one to be moving or memorable.  This is a bland recording by an artist who has done far better; I would recommend it only for hardcore Young fans.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Here is a young man with a big voice.  Anyone hearing him without seeing him on his album would think they were listening to a grown man.  His voice is deep and soulful, full of passion and ultra-rich, as he sings his heart out in the four languages of English, Spanish, Italian and French.<br />My favourite is of course You Raise Me Up sung in English, and I can hear it over and again and again it only makes the tune better, and of course Oceano sung in French.<br />What remarkable talent!!! What a remarkable voice!!!  I love it.<br />Heather Marshall  Sugar-Cane  Bridgetown  11/10/04
B000000HHE|5.0|if you are one of those people who listens to Ludacris and all the other junk that's out there. In fact, if you even own any of the awful \\"Hip Hop\\" that they play on the radio today, please DON'T buy this album. It would only be wasted on you and taken off the shelf for some other person who may appreciate and understand what De La Soul means.  <br /> This album is goofy, fun, groovy, light, interesting, yellow, pink and light blue. <br />
B000001ESP|5.0|This album is one of the all-time greats - any band any time. Why? It is unique. It is exceptionally powerful, visionary, personal and accessible.<br /><br />I, the listener, can relate to many of the messages in this album. I, the musician, can relate to simply outstanding playing.<br /><br />And what's absolutely wonderful, they can still do it! Like no one else in all my 40+ years of listening to rock music, they can still play this material in concert and I still feel its absolutely here, now, relevant, and mindblowing.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I think that the musical highlights here are legion, even though not necessarily the best in their work. There were a couple of tracks (those leading to Signals and beyond), that I didn't like to start with. They are actually my favourite tracks now - Vital Signs for example.<br /><br />While its not my favourite Rush album (hard to say which is), Moving Pictures is probably the standout in the canon of Rush, and a standout in the entire canon of rock.
0316666343|5.0|Am nearing the end of The Lovely Bones, oh my.  Disturbing, compelling, intimate.  It is emotionally candid & raw w/o the need for sensationalism to \\"make up\\" for the usual lack of candor or depth.  The author is just that good.  I can't recall a book that has kicked my emotional (...) all over the map like this one has.  It is potent and stunning.  I was startled to realize that I saw myself a little in each character, recognized that each possess their own quiet longing, and awestruck with the depth of understanding the author exhibits in writing about the pursuits of each character trying to fill their emptiness'.  Am darn glad to own the hardback of this one because I will read and reread it regularly.  Naturally, I will be reading Sebold's Lucky, A Memoir very soon.
0156027321|1.0|I wasted my time reading this. It has no value to me at all. <br />It's not even worth rating. I would give this a null rating except amazon requires it. Don't waste your time or money on this. You have been warned.
6304493681|5.0|I don't watch much anime, but this is the best I've seen.  The plot is well thought out, the voices are good, and it has a realistic, if somewhat moody, atmosphere.  This movie isn't rated, but it should get an R at the very least.  The only problem sith this movie is the overdone nudity.  There are two characters who go nude in this movie.  The first is a cyborge body, which is busted up for most of the movie, but you  can still see its breasts.  Yes, it's a \\"female\\" body.  The main character, also a girl, is naked on three diffferent occurences.  On the seccond you don't see anything though.  Technically, she is  wearing a body suit, but it does little more than hide her lower private parts, and is also skin colored. <br /> <br />All in all this is a great movie, however if nudity offends or distracts you, stay away.  Also hide this from your kids.
0156027321|4.0|It was hard for me to get through the first hundred pages of this book. I do like good starters, but honestly I didnt feel that it picked up until Pi goes on his amazing adventure that I know Ill never forget. The symbolism is amazing and it related to my everyday life. I would often get done reading a chapter of the book and have long discussions with my friends. I loved it till the very end. Even when I questioned if this book and story was for real. <br /> <br />I over all thought it was a well writen book and worth anyone reading.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie would be laughable and otherwise ignorable if it wasn't for Michael Moore's attempt at trying to manipulate facts to change the outcome of an election. He is perpetuating a deception on the American people through this movie. His distoraiton and outright lies of facts is deplorable. At a time when America is fighting for its survival as a free society, this movie is a serious disservice. For an honest appraisal read FARENHYPE9/11 or see the DVD by the same title. The light of truth always causes the lies to fall.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is a must get! You could listen to this CD over and over and over...you will never get bored. My favorite songs are 2, 3, and 4. I would rate this CD over 5...but I cant :( <br /> <br />One of my friends doesn't like Avril...but she said her sis got it and that she admits some of the songs were really cool. <br />Personaly, I donno how N E 1 could not like Avril!

B0002OERI0|5.0|Man - I can't believe some of the negative reviews here man.  Green Day is Punk - I should know, I've been buying Punk albums like charlotte and Green Day at Wal-Mart and Best Buy for almost 3 years.  Besides, if you see them on MTV and all the other major media, they have green hair, and ripped clothes and spikey hair, and all the other things Punks wear - see they ARE punk.    If you don't like Green Day, then you don't pass, what we here like to call the \\"Green Day Litmus Test.\\"  That means, that you are either (A) A Republican, or (B) an eltist punk.    Man, if you can't handle the political message on this album, then you can't handle it.  I mean, its so ... political!  Man, I mean Bush and Iraq, and stuff, man that's bad!  Why?  Because I saw Fahrenheit 911 and believed everything in it without question and it showed me that Bush is bad. Plus, some of my high school teachers said he is, and I want to be cool with my friends at school and they all say he is, so bush is bad.  That's called \\"thinking for yourself.\\"  You better get down with it.    Next, to all you elitist punks, you better start dealing.  Just because your punk experience wasn't going to a stadium with 50,000 other \\"punks\\" using the $60 ticket your parents bought you from Ticket master, to go see the Toyota Punkfest, doesn't make you the great keepers of knowledge of all things punk.  This ain't your father's oldsmobile!  Man, I mean, we are dealing with some serious Angst here.  Bush, and Iraq, and Enron, man, - I can't articulate or process any of those things other than the sound bytes I've picked up here and there, but those things are not cool.  Even the Internet says Bush is bad!  So you know its true.    Just had to get that off my chest.  Now, onto the ablum.    In every possible way, this album rocks.  It rocks hard.  It rocks long.  It rocks with conviction.  Punk rock, that is.  Take the title track.  I mean, that track rocks.  And if you don't like it, we know what YOU are (see above).    The whole idea, and lyrics, and messages on this ablum, are SO deep.  I mean it blows my mind, that someone has the courage to put out an album like this.  They are PUSHING the bar.  Just because every other band, and my parents and teachers and friends and michael moore, and al franken, and everybody else is saying the exact same thing, i.e., Bush is Bad - doesn't mean that green day isn't rebelling or being non-conformist by saying it too.  They are - being rebellious, that is.  Green Day's taking some serious chances here, as you can see, by the album going quadruple platinum in 3 weeks.      My mom needs to get on the Internet now, so I'll wrap this up.  But when I go to college next year, I am SERIOUSLY looking forward to being indoctrinated in how to think correctly, like hating bush, because that's how it is if you want to be punk and think for yourself.    Green Day forever!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This  film takes the \\"what if\\" question to an extreme, and in order to illustrate it, it uses extremely radical situations to provide the story line.  Of course, mundane life changes wouldn't make much of a movie, so I didn't have a problem with the subject matter, which includes child molestation, child porn, suicide, mental institutions and the like.  I didn't find anything too graphic or too disturbing, and I think the directors got the point across without crossing any lines.<br /><br />The script for this film was excellent and I believe the acting was first rate.<br /><br />Without going into the actual story, the basic premise is that a college student studying the human memory and how it works, finds a way to alter the past and thus change the future (his current present state).  Unlike basic time travel stories, where the person traveling in time actually goes back (or forward) in his own body, in this story, the character simply shows up in a scene in his body as it was at the time, but with his \\"current\\" mind and knowledge.  From that vantage point, he tries to alter a horrible event by saying or doing something that will change the event enough to change the future for the better.<br /><br />Of course the film, like all good drama, is an interesting movie because every time the character tries to reach his goal something gets screwed up and things get worse.<br /><br />I think the power of this film, and its redeeming quality, is the fact that while we (or at least most of us) believe that it is impossible to change the past, the reality is that small choices we make today can have dramatic effects on our future and those around us.  The real message of the movie (in my opinion)  is to make the right choices now, in the present, because even small errors in judgment at the present can mushroom into major problems later.<br /><br />I give a strong recommendation to this movie, it is disturbing in many ways, but well worth seeing.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|First, I should say that this review is biased since I'm a HUGE Knopfler fan. That's not to say, however, that I think every album he has released is an instant classic. Some are better than others, Shangri-La is one of the good ones. Ragpicker's Dream and Sailing to Philly were both fine albums, but weren't solid all the way through. Shangri-La offers up a very enjoyable 60-something minute listen. In my opinion, MK's songwriting ability is second to very, very few. The songs on this album are evidence of this. Several of them are among some of his most melodic work ('Shangri-La', 'Everybody Pays', and 'Postcards from Paraguay' among them). All in all, a very mellow album, with intricate guitar work and great lyrics. He is a master at telling stories with song. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron maiden are one of my favorite bands and there's no other  like them. After  been a fan for so long and listing to every single album by im? I came to the coclusion, that, \\"powerslave\\" is maiden's best effort todate...Even better then the masterpice \\"number of the beast\\" and thats saying alot, i know. On \\"powerslave\\" you've speed,originality, unmatched riffs, the best vocals in metal ever and  amazing lirycs. I recommend.
0316096199|4.0|The book \\"Lucky\\" by Alice Sebold was very good. I liked it because it gave you insight on her life and how the rape affected her. She also proves that you can overcome something in your life that's hard. She is a very good role model for that.

B00005JMAH|4.0|Remember, these are all my personal thoughts and don't apply to everyone. <br />For the most part, this is, I'll admit, a very good movie. I know that it is the movie and not the book and that directors are always going change something, but really, get some things right. <br />Now I'm not saying that this was a bad, untrue movie, it was excellent. But they changed things that really didn't need to be changed. For example, the layout of the castle and the grounds. And Fred and George's and Malfoy`s hair, and the outfits. It shows their style and stuff, but just leave it!  <br />I do like how Cuaron added a bunch of scenes that showed how close Harry/Ron/Hermione and the Gryffindors were. And that they are getting older and such things, which helps you get to know the character better. <br /> <br />But here come the complaints: <br />1. There was hardly any Quidditch! And no Quidditch Cup!!! I know the plot is getting thicker, and there isn't a lot of time but really, give the kid some fun! And the Cup is a very cool thing, especially in Oliver Wood's last year. <br />2.I think that the Sirius/Harry scene at the end should have been a bit longer but, as I said before, there isn't a lot of time... <br />3.They didn't even tell who made the Marauders Map!! That is a VERY important thing, I think. I think that people should read the books before they see the movies anyway, but if you didn't then you would not know. <br />4. I do not like David Thewlis as Lupin. I know this is up to personal opinion, but I thought he was too old and too creepy. Just not someone that I could get close to and I think that you have to get close to a character that important. <br />5. The werewolf and Patronus! The werewolf looked more like a man-wolf to me. Werewolves are supposed to look like a very wild wolf. Look at any of Mary Granpre`s illustrations and tell me they got it right. And the Patronus, they didn't even say that it turned into Harry's dad... <br /> <br />Oh, I really liked Gary Oldman as Sirius Black though. At first I was worried that he wouldn't be right, but he as close to perfect as I think that you can get. And I like Buckbeak and the new Dumbledore. He brings out the joker side of Dumbledore. But I am definitely buying this movie, no matter what complaints I have. It is still Harry Potter and still a good movie. It has its faults though. <br />
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Yes. Avril Lavigne is by far the worse music to ever be created and also ? She cannot sing to save her pathetic  loser life. Whats so appealing about a  stupid,nerdy,skinng,ugly,white girl ?Another thing...She looks sick too. Mtv is the worse music channel ever and dont know good music if it was fed to them.Avril lavigne's \\"under my skin\\" is a waste of plastic in every sentence of the word. Dont support trash.
B0002VKZL6|1.0|If this a relaxed album from the guitar master,--well, the \\"master\\" must have got the recording date wrong, this is very boring, almost sing-song in places, almost as bad as some of the junk the \\"BOSS\\" puts out these days, save your money.
B0000027RL|5.0|When I bought this album I was skeptical. I heard some people say that pearl jam was better than nirvana, and I am a die hard fan of nirvana. They are my favorite band and probably always will be until I find something better. So, naturally I was offended, I mean look at how popular nirvana is compared to pearl jam. Pearl Jam still records albums and tours; Kurt died in 1994 and who do we remember? <br /> <br />To be honest I didn't think this album was grunge at first; it didn't sound anything like other grunge bands that I had become used too. It was a lot different, and at first glance I didn't like this album at first. I only liked Jeremy, Alive, and Even Flow and only moderately. It wasn't until about six months later I gave the rest of the album a second glance and boy was I surprised. <br />Once- Over all it's a good song, and pretty catchy, and well thought out but not my favorite 8/10 <br />Even Flow- originally my favorite song from pearl jam, the chorus is so beautiful, and I love how it just explodes with emotion towards the end just pretty much all the songs on this album. 10/10 <br />Alive- Amazing, This one a few songs that  I had already heard this once before I bought this album and the climax towards the end with that great solo fills me up with adrenaline every time I hear it. 10/10 <br />Why Go- This song gets a lot of flack for no reason I think, sure its lyrics aren't as good as others, but the vocals are great in the chorus and it tells a interesting story, which is another thing I like about pearl jam. Nirvana only has a handful songs that have a story (Polly, paper cuts ect.) and they tend to be my favorites. 9/10 <br />Black- Truly touching, the lyrics are well thought out, Eddie seems to almost cry out the lyrics towards the end, its very beautiful and powerful 10/10 <br />Jeremy- There isn't much I can say about it that hasn't already been said, easily one best songs ever made, the video tells its story perfectly. I will never get tired of this one. 10/10 <br />Oceans- I love this one, the vocals are so well done it makes you want to cry. Even though it's mostly just a lot of oohs and aaahs it's so beautiful. 9.5/10 <br />Porch- My least favorite song off the album, its too poppy (similar to Even Flow) but with out enough effect to make me want to listen to it more. 7.5/10 <br />Garden- Defiantly underrated. I would almost consider it as good as Jeremy when I first started to listen to it. It basically my favorite song currently from pearl jam. It's perfect. The vocals are southing and powerful at the same time. 10/10 <br />Deep- Kind of poppy but it is catchy enough for me want more of it. The guitar if very catchy and probably the best guitar work of the album. 9/10 <br />Release- I hated this track at first; but now its one of my favorites. Its starts off slow and then really explode with emotion from Eddie's Vocals while the rest of the song stays calm. 9-10 <br /> <br />Over all its Pearl Jams best album in my opinion, I'm not as fond of there later work as I am of this album with the exception of VS. So that's my biggest complaint to someone who says pearl jam is better than nirvana. Nirvana's in Utero was better than their much more popular album nevermind in my opinion, which only made it seem like nirvana was just starting to realize their full potential. Pearl Jam nowadays only seems to be fading away, even though they still tour and occasionally record material, they haven't ever been able to come close to ten's perfection in many years, and I don't think they are trying to anymore, but just want to appreciate there carrier instead of trying to improve it. <br /> <br />I don't respect a nirvana fan who says pearl jam sucks or they are overrated (which it about the dumbest thing I have ever heard) because they don't know what they are talking about and they are stubborn, but I also don't respect pearl jam fans who say nirvana sucks or say that they are overrated for the same reasons. <br /> <br />Bottom Line Get this Album, you won't regret it! <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|This album was a shocker to me. The first song was decent (Bring Me to Life), but the instrumentation was pretty well done. The second single was more emotional driven (Going Under). That song was real good. I still slept on it until My Immortal came out. That is a deep song with emotional chords and melodies. One thing about hip-hop (rap) is no one raps with emotion since PAC. I love rock because it hits home when you need it to hit.  <br /> <br />Top 3 Songs: Going Under, My Immortal, My Last Breath <br />Bottom 3 Songs: Bring Me to Life, Haunted, Hello <br />Sleeper: Whisper
B0001XTIUO|5.0|With her hauntingly beautiful album, \\"Parallelograms,\\" Linda Perhacs offers each listener a stunning gift:  a magical journey into the world of psychedelic folk music as the gods meant it to be.  Her lyrics and music mirror a love of nature, along with the personal and most intimate parts of her soul.  Listening to her, one is continually struck by the perfection of Linda's voice; you cannot help being emotionally moved.  This wonderful CD personifies perfection...with taste, warmth, sensitivity, feeling, perception, and all the womanly virtues. <br /> <br />When it comes to this singer/composer, I confess to a large dose of bias that might influence my objectivity about \\"Parallelograms,\\" or at least render it suspect.  You see, Linda and I are dear friends and were high school classmates together in Mill Valley, California.  Some reviewers claim that Linda was a Love Child of the 60s, but in high school she embodied all the attributes of the classic \\"girl next door;\\" all the boys wanted to date her, and all the girls wanted to be like her.  Linda was head cheerleader, an honor student, sang lead in the school musical (\\"Pajama Game\\"), and was homecoming queen.  By any measurement, she was a sensational 17 year-old girl.  Now, years later, she is an even more beautiful woman, still brimming with talent and spiritual insight.  It wasn't by accident that \\"Mojo Music Magazine\\" picked \\"Parallelograms\\" as one of its 67 all time best lost albums.  Let's hope Linda favors us with another masterpiece---soon.
B0001I561E|5.0|...I still have to chastise Disney for caving in and editing the lyrics in the opening tune (Arabian Nights): they removed \\"Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face\\" and replaced it something like \\"Where the desert is immense and the heat is intense.\\" (You can hear the correctly sung line on the CD soundtrack and on the laserdisc version.) The redubbing of the line sounds stilted and noticeably out of timbre. <br /> <br />Wimps! All the same, it's one of my favorites from Disney and still makes me laugh ten years after I first saw it.
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie was perhaps one of the funniest I have seen in a long   time.  Will Ferrel gave a great performance and the jokes just kept coming.  The movie did not have a strong plot, but the humor was out of control.  I found myself gasping for air half the time, thanks to Brick, the less than average weatherman.  Besides the overwhelming amount of humor this movie had, the cameos were fantastic. <br />   Having so many actors adds alot to the film.  Not only does the movie have a wide variety of actors, but each actor takes on a completely different persona.  The movie is absolutely amazing with an unlimited supply of laughs.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|elf is my favorite christmas movie by far.and will ferrel did an awesome job acting and he had a great sence of hummor.one of the things i didint like about thit film is that its taking so long to arive on dvd. but this was an awesom family movie.and trust me  it was hilarious.
B00005JNEU|5.0|There was a lot of hype around this movie, and it delivers. The movie focuses on a high school football team in 1988, and the pressure put on them to succeed. Things start out great then their star player gets sidelined for the season with a torn ACL. The movie focuses just as much on football as it does outside of football.     The best scenes in the movie are when three of the teams stars are out shooting, and after the team's injured superstar finishes cleaning out his locker. Each of these scenes demonstrate the fact that these players are just kids and they are only playing high school football. In the shooting scene, one player says \\" we're only 17\\" then his buddy says \\" do you feel 17, I don't\\".     The scene with the injured running back is probably one of the saddest scene I have ever seen in any movie. He cleans out his locker and heads out to his uncle's car. As soon as he gets in he starts crying and saying \\"what am I gonna do now, I don't know nothing but football\\". It is so sad because it's true. Earlier in the movie he is going through letters from colleges, he has another player there helping him because he can barely read.    Those scenes are great and so insightful to how intense it is in that town and how high expextations are, and how much pressure is put on the kids. There are many other scenes that demonstrate this, but this movie is well worth the price of admission, so I don't want to ruin it.    This is a football movie, and a lot of great football is included. This movie demonstrates the power of motivation, confidence, and team work. Although the story doesn't end as many of us would hope, the final game is still amazing.    Friday Night Lights is a great movie, and I agree that this may be the greatest sports story ever told. The football scenes are amazing, emotional, and easy to get into. While the non-football part of the movie helps you easily identify and feel for each character. Characters are easily defined and greatly acted. The football scenes are beautifully directed also.     Every mintue of this movie is worth watching. It is amazing, and a must see for everyone.
B000067J1H|5.0|This was a beautiful flick. After the first time watching it, it seems quite confusing. But just going back to it, listening, and understanding, it all comes together. This is like no other movie you have seen, and it really takes a different look at things in life.  <br /> <br />If you have ever watched the matrix, this would be about its equilivant in mind blowing. After the movie there is that chat of what really happened, and understanding it is what the fun part is.  <br /> <br />To watch this movie, you need to listen carefully. Words and sayings used in this movie are very clever and complex, but very intresting and fun. If you are looking for a movie to mess with the mind, but still entertain you and a few of your guests, this is the movie to choose. The ideas and thoughts put behind this movie keeps it very intresting to watch. If you have the time, watch the commentary, it will help it make more sense. If your looking for a funny, sit back and not pay attention to half the movie, I would NOT suggest this.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Roland Emmerich has come out with another great idea with some more great special effects. But once again, the story falls flat and will most likely leave you thinking, this movie could of been so much more.    This movie is fun to watch one time, but after that it's pointless. Every event is set up for a \\"shock\\" or \\"surprise\\", and that kind of thing is only good for one go 'round. The shocks and surprises are worthwhile the first time, but it's no fun watching a movie again if there is nothing to look forward to. Like a jack in the box, it's only good for one time, because it is no surprise that the jack is going to come out again at the same time, with the same look on his face.     The global warming idea was good, and so were the special effects. The actors did a good job also. Those are the high points of the movie. How the events happened in the movie weren't all that great though. But the movie is worth watching one time.    Overall, the movie just doesn't have any replay value. There are no actions sequences that were amazing, jokes that you'll tell your friends about, and the story isn't deep enough that anyone will have to watch the movie again because they missed something.        Rent even you haven't seen this movie, rent it. It is a fun and entertaining movie to watch.....the first time.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Some might dismiss this movie as a sappy romance only to be viewed by women holding a large box of tissues, but the storyline and cast list of Cold Mountain brings to life a story of our history as Americans. Brought to life by its characters, this movie tells a story of our cold, turbulant past, and it opens our eyes to the horrible acts against our fellow countrymen during the Civil War. The cast of the movie fit their roles well. Rene Zellweger and Nicole Kidman were a perfect duo in the movie that helped bring the story alive. Each character, however, had their own place in developing the story and the emotions of the war. The music in the movie also attributed to the overall feeling of the film. Many elements went into this movie to make it an outstanding film. I highly recommend this film. It will not be a disappointment.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Very good. Nice slow songs, I used to not like slower songs <br />Best Songs: Jesus of Suburbia and Shes a Rebel <br />Don't get why they keep mentioning ohwhatshername and jimmy <br />The whole album is weird but good, I liked it a lot
B00005JM1F|5.0|Before ever viewing the outrageous comedy with a star studded line-up in \\"Old School,\\" I went in with an open mind, not expecting to be blown away, but only expecting to simply \\"like\\" it.  I felt like any movie starring Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn is at least worth watching.  Within the first 5 minutes of the movie I had cracked my first laugh, a subtle laugh that seems to be ongoing through out the entire film. <br />The basic storyline of the movie is about one of three middle aged men who moves directly onto a college campus into a house that would soon become one of the biggest party houses the college had ever seen.  The house is later threatened to be rezoned by the university because it is not providing for the school in any way.  The three men then decide to form a fraternity, which leads to a series of outrageous and hilarious events that all the members of the fraternity experience.  The movie never loses interest; there is funny part after funny part, and even a couple of guest star appearances.   <br />\\"Old School\\" is hands down one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen.  The star studded lineup adds a lot to this movie and makes it that much more entertaining for me personally because I recognize each of the characters from different movies or shows.  There are non-stop hilarious scenes from the movie, the laughs just never stop.  I would recommend this outrageous comedy above any other, I guarantee you wont find a dull moment.  It is a movie that can easily be seen more than once, and will leave you with more and more laughs each time you see it. <br />
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|First of all Im not sure I saw the same movie that all these nay sayers have seen. That some didnt like this movie is understandable, but to call it a \\"bad movie\\" or \\"boring\\"? I just think that's a giant stretch even by the harshest of critics.<br /><br />Troy, is a wonderful modern-day interpretation of Homer's \\"The Illiad\\" which must be one of the most well known story's of all time. The Trojan war was long thought to be a myth, which no basis in reality. Untill one historian spent his life searching for the city of Troy and found what he believed to be it's ruins. This sparked a lot of debate on whether such a tale might well have it's roots in real events.<br /><br />\\"Troy\\" is born of this desire to contemplate \\"what may have really happened\\". It doesnt have any God's or Godesses, nor does it really stick firm to Homer's tale. What it does is take Homer's work and reintepret it through the mindset of \\"hey this is what might have really went down\\". This is why many such as Robert Ebert didnt like \\"Troy\\", because they were expecting Homer.<br /><br />But the storyline of troy has all the essence of homer only portrayed in a more realisitic version. Helen, wife of the king of Sparta, falls in love with Paris Prince of the powerful city state of Troy. She willingly sneaks out of Sparta and from a loveless marriage to the trojan boat and returns with Paris to Troy. This sparks a chain of events culminating in a massive war and the fall of a city. The King of Sparta is outraged and appeals to his brother - Agamemnon - who has just finished uniting the cities of greece under his rule. Using his brother's misfortune as a pretext for war, he assembles a 40,000 man strong army and sails them to troy on 1,000 ships. And so begins the trojan war.<br /><br />The acting throughout the movie varies from acceptable to spectacular. Brad pit gives an excellent performance as the hero Achilles. But Achilles of the movie is not immortal or divine, just an amazing warrior with a complex personality consisting of strong narcasism and some true honor (they dont always mix well). The character of hector is brilliantly portrayed as a man who has seen war and knows there is no glory in it, the antithesis of achilles. While Peter O'Toole (yes from Lawrence of Arabia!) does a FANTASTIC job as the Trojan king Priam. One scene is truly dramatic as he begs achilles for the body of his fallen son, proclaiming \\"even enemies can show respect\\".<br /><br />The battle scenes and special effects are amazing, and the battles in troy are second to none. But it's not all action, in fact much of troy is a look at the nature of war and politics. How the macro affects the micro. How small events trigger big ones. How ordinary people can play a part in larger than life stories. And how history plays out similar stories again and again. There's a strong anti-war message underlying the film. There's also a lot of unfinished ideas and holes in troy that never get filled. The end feels rushed and thrown together, and some interesting ideas brought up by the film are never fully explored. This is made up for by some truly GREAT scenes. Such as when the Greek fleet apears on the horizons of Troy. Bells are sounded, and all the characters react when they look out to see the horizon clouded with enemy ships. This scene is so well done it amazed me.<br /><br />All things considered I found Troy to not only be a great movie, but a great analysis of how the world works and how the greed of the few culminates in the suffering of the many. It wasnt as powerful as gladiator, and it isnt going to have the broader appeal of LOTR (it's not that kinda movie at all, completely different genre in fact), but while it's no Brave Heart, troy is the first movie in a while to come close to being in that class and is certainly an excellent movie.ith a complex personality consisting of strong narcasism and some true honor (they dont always mix well).

0345452577|3.0|I read everthing Jonathan Kellerman and I'm a great fan but this outing was not his best.  I agree with many of the reviewers who were dismayed by the lack of character development of the CCC members, the long drawn out path to the final conclusion, the somewhat irritating and whiney main character and the quick resolution of the plot.  The story line was great but the execution was puzzling.  But--as someone else said--Jonathan is allowed a stumble or two.  We still love him!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Van Helsing Sucks! <br /> <br />I cannot believe that people actually give this movie high praise. Not only is this movie an insult to horror fans, this movie is an insult to movie lovers.  <br /> <br />It appears that I am officially out of the demographic. Not the usual 18-35 demographic (I'm 32), but the demographic that enjoys overly loud, obnoxious films with bad acting, horrible writing and special effects that make Jason & the Argonauts look cutting edge. Actually now that I think about it Jason & The Argonauts does look better. <br /> <br />I don't even know where to begin with explaining how bad this film truly is. Van Helsing screws up major movie monster lore. I am not even an expert in the lore of these old movie monsters, but I do know that Dracula is not just supposed to change back and fourth at will.  <br /> <br />Let's start with Dracula; this version of a classic movie monster has to be one of the worst of all times. He's completely silly and not convincing at all. The actor Richard Roxburgh is perhaps the lamest Dracula I have ever seen. He is truly awful and uninspired. Let's hope this guy finds his nitch playing bad guys in straight to video Richard Grieco action flicks. What's a matter the production couldn't afford Julian Sands? Not to mention these Dracula's have gaping mouths, which look completely silly. The Count has 3 female servants; they are so over the top and downright horrible. They scream and shriek, for what is basically  of the entire picture.  <br /> <br />Frankenstein is another atrocity. His silly sympathetic character is truly awful. His look is downright comical. He Did nothing in this movie to make it any more enjoyable. How can a thing made up of seven different people, swing from cables with all the dexterity of Tarzan?  <br /> <br />The accents by everyone involved were horrible. I expected better of Kate Bekinsale. While looking extremely hot, it was not enough to make me care about her boring character spewing out thishorrible dialogue that is given to her. I understand why Hugh Jackman took the role. I think he has about 12 lines in the entire film, and probably made about 10 million dollars. We can't expect him to just sit around waiting for X-Men sequels.  <br /> <br />When I see a movie I understand what it means to \\"suspend disbelief\\", but the logic (if you can call it that) is not even based in reality in the slightest. There are moments that look like they are right out of a video game, including 1st person shooter perspectives. Not to mention the moments that look like they are paying tribute to some of Warner Brothers best Willie Coyote cartoons, compliments of The Wolf man characters (yes there is more than one). Not to mention that the ending is so bad that it does not even make you forgive the rest of the film. The worst part of all at a mere 2 hours this film feels like it will NEVER END!!! <br /> <br />This film is easily one of the more disappointing films I have ever seen. I didn't even pay for it...I saw it free, and still felt like I was ripped off. After walking out the crowd had a collective feeling of \\"What did we just see\\"-type vibe. VH ruins any love one had for these movie monsters. Universal should be ashamed for green-lighting such a piss poor product, that basically spits on anything they have accomplished in the past. I think the saddest part of all this is the amount of money 15 year olds will spend to see this movie, it will actually garner a sequel. This movie is not even a fun bad movie; I can enjoy a fun bad movie. It's a shame when films like this receive so much attention and a much better movie get lost in the shuffle (i.e Sky Captain and the World of TOmorrow). <br /> <br />The only thing that would have saved this movie is if it were completely animated by a non Disney company. Something of a cool dark look. Then the movie would be great. I could buy the things that happen in this film if it were a cartoon.  <br /> <br />Any comparison to Indiana Jones is completely inaccurate. How dare these people compare a FILM CLASSIC with this piece of crap? The creators of VH do not have near the passion invested that is involved with even the first 15 minutes of \\"Raiders\\". Please do not drag this feces that is VH anywhere near Indiana Jones. The mainstream films today are not made by passionate filmmakers, these are corporate \\"yes\\" men getting paid to crank out these expensive \\"kiddie\\" flicks instead of putting heart and soul into great works that will actually be remembered after 2 weeks. Next time I will go with my gut instinct and stay away from movies where even the trailer looks like it sucks. <br />
B00005JMXX|5.0|This is a new way to destroy the world. No alien invasions (Independence Day), and big lizards (Godzilla), the new villans: the humans. We are destroying our planet, and this is one of some things that will destroy it. <br /> <br />I have bought yesterday the region 4 edition, here in Mexico, and the metal-package is outsanding. The two discs, widescreen edition and the metal-removable-lithograpic in 3-D in the front are very good. I have bought Independence Day and Stargate and the packages are too amazing, thanks to the design crew.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|I think that some people come to be a little harsh about what Aphex Twin (Richard D. James) can really do.  I once read a review on the internet with Aphex and this reviewer.  He was asking Aphex why people should sit down and listen to his music and he somply responded with some smart-ally remarks, which I don't blame him because he can really create something remarkable with his ambient tunes.  'Selected Ambient Works 85-92' takes you through a journey of Richard's ambient textures along with other light styles including a track with jungle-like background beats and warp (Green Calx).  'Xtal' was beautiful as if was the perfect way to kick off the album and it only gets better with 'Tha' and 'Pulsewidth'.  I would also say that 'Actium' was a nice ending for the CD as it's a very lazy track that is perfect to listen to while you are sleeping/napping or on dark days.  For those who have not really liked or appreciated Aphex Twin's warped techno music/beats, give this one a try.<br /><br />That's my review, thanks!
0553573403|5.0|Im not beating around the bush here folks, im here to deliver a short and sweet review of a Game of Thrones.I have read many many books, many of those in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. this book is practically FLAWLESS. sad and demoralized after finishing Robert Jordans travesty WOT book ten, i was reluctant to pick up another 700 page fantasy novel. to my surprise and delight i found that a Game of Thrones surpasses all other competition in the fantasy genre. character development, plot, and action are unspeakably well crafted. many complain that this series is impossible to read, and that G. Martin just keeps on senselessly killing off character after character. LIES! the book constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. characters are very seldom killed, and when they are you can be damn sure it plays a crucial part in the plot. for god sakes i never even had to skip chapters (hint hint Robert Jordan) to get through this one. other fantasy lovers may claim the bbok doesnt contain enough magic and spells to suit their fancy. though it is true that the book is more realistic and less \\"magical\\" i guarantee you love it anyway. though the material is a bit dark and suited for more mature readers only,this book is a must read at all costs.<br /><br />the end

B00028HBKM|5.0|There have been many Movies that have depicted the last stages of Christ's life but none like this.  This movie was identicle to the bible, even every little detail.  With the great acting and an amazing set up for the  movie, this was the most touching movie that has ever been released.   <br />I went to see this movie in the theatre, and left a different person.  I never felt so into the movie, and felt like i should have helped or done something to help.  I have always been a huge believer and follower or his words, but while watching this movie i felt as if i was there with him, feeling his pain.   <br />While in the theatre i had never seen so many sad teary faces.  I could tell the whole theatre felt the pain i felt the whole time he was betrayed.  I will forever remember first watching this movie and as walking out of the theatre, hearing silence, and seeing so many grown people crying. <br />
6305126062|5.0|I agree with all the glorious things said about the film-making - the panorama of the landscapes, the story of the injured horse and the 'wounded' child, and also the romantic subplot.<br /><br />I am writing here with the singular purpose, however, of suggesting that viewers be prepared for a very, very startling beginning. The accident is graphic enough to upset, but I feel that advance notice may help the sensitive or the young to prepare for it or to have a viewing buddy preview it and maybe 'edit' for them.<br /><br />Aside from that brief sequence, the rest is wonderful.
B00005JMAH|4.0|I went and saw Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and to be honest I was definitely a little disappointed. I absolutely loved the books and the first two movies, I feel, really did the books justice, but this one lacked in detail. I know that that condensing plays a large part in making books into movies but come on! The movie missed out on a lot of important features that were in the book.  <br /> <br />I have really never been keen on the idea of the book set becoming a movie set mainly for the reason of important features. The books let you create your own images from your imagination. The movies really take the fun out of your thoughts. <br />
0553212737|5.0|Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.     How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.    Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.    Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.    There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.     I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.    Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie.
B0002234LS|2.0|Stephen King story about a frustrated writer should tell you all you need to know about this dormant suspense thriller from the \\"Sixth Sense\\" school of logic. It plods along until it's not so surprising climax with little distinction between it and other similiar movies. Johnny Depp is cool, the film is not.
B000001EKX|4.0|Many point to this album as not being one of Kiss' better efforts, or that it was a career \\"misstep\\"; in a way, I agree with the first, but I definitely don't agree with the second. Yes, this is not one of their better efforts, but it certainly doesn't suck by any means; the \\"sophomore jinx\\" didn't apply here as Kiss returned with a vengeance not quite 8 months after their classic debut was released.<br /><br />During this period, Kiss were still trying to find their sound and establish their identity (or rather, conceal their identity!); they were touring at a near-constant pace and also facing a lot of pressure from their record label and management to deliver a \\"hit\\" album. So considering that this was rehearsed and recorded very quickly on their rare days off from touring (and not to mention that this was their 2nd album released in the same year), it's a consistent and rewarding album.<br /><br />I absorbed \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" pretty heavily back in the day, but I've recently began re-absorbing it and have developed an even greater appreciation for it 30 years later. I agree with the many people who have said that the sound quality and production on this album are substandard and primitive, but perhaps that was the point of it all; a majority of the basic tracks were recorded live in the studio, and the liner notes on the CD state that with this album, Kiss succeeded in achieving the \\"untamed\\" sound they had been searching for.<br /><br />Musically, the one member of Kiss who shines on this album is Ace Frehley; he began to make his presence known and stepped up to the plate to deliver some of his best guitar solos as well as some of his best and heaviest songs. \\"Strange Ways\\" is a prime example...the guitars are loud and leaden-sounding, and the plodding rhythms in the intro provided by the drums & bass make it sound like a sort of heavy metal Indian war dance. Ace furiously picks a frenetic, Hendrix-like guitar solo that will positively rip your head off at high volume!<br /><br />My next favorite track is the somewhat disturbing \\"Goin' Blind\\", where Gene Simmons puts himself into the mind and body of a 93-year old man who is having a sordid affair with a 16-year old girl. As bizarre as the subject matter of the song is, it's classic Gene Simmons through and through; again, Ace Frehley delivers a short but effective guitar solo. Other standouts are the concert classic \\"Watchin' You\\", the slow and slurred title track and another concert staple \\"Let Me Go, Rock & Roll\\". Lastly, the oriental influence that dominates the album cover art gives it an \\"imported\\" look; at first glance, I thought that the album was a Japanese import and not an American release!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is a definite progression from the more \\"tame\\" sound that characterized their debut album. Give it another listen and rediscover a true diamond in the rough!gh volume!<br /><br />My next favorite track is the somewhat disturbing \\"Goin' Blind\\", where Gene Simmons puts himself into the mind and body of a 93-year old man who is having a sordid affair with a 16-year old girl.

B0000035E7|2.0|Nirvana has proven to be the most influential rock band of the current rock era.  On this CD you can very much hear the hints of something brand new being born, something clearly demonstrated in \\"About A Girl\\" and \\"Scoff\\", but through the rest of the album they seem to be searching for that revolutionary sound. I'm not in any way lowering their status as musicians, but I am saying that this album was a prototype, and just as Beethoven labored endlessly through draft upon draft upon draft to reach his desired sound this too shows that process. \\"Bleach\\" seems, to me, to be more of a draft of a new sound rather than the new sound itself.  On more of a side note I almost detected some Metallica influences in this album, particularly in regards to some of the drumming and choppy guitar breaks that are not as prevelant in later Nirvana albums.
B000001DYJ|3.0|This really isn't up to par enough to be called \\"Alive III\\", but for what it is, it isn't too bad; it has its' moments. What ultimately makes this album fall a bit short of the mark is the sound quality; Eddie Kramer was enlisted again as the producer, since he produced the classics Alive I & II, but his production here is rather uneven. The crowd sounds were too loud and the explosions are even louder, which could possibly damage or blow your speakers at high volumes. Musically, Eric Singer's drums are flat and low in the mix, and Gene's bass is even lower at least half of the time. About the only exciting thing is Bruce Kulick's guitar playing; he really steps up and delivers some great leads, but that's about it.<br /><br />Kiss was just going through the motions at this point and bowing to pressure to produce another live album; the previous years' \\"Revenge\\" was a strong comeback and return to form following the untimely death of Eric Carr in 1991, but this album was like taking a step or two backward. Kiss really should've waited 3 more years when Ace Frehley and Peter Criss returned for the 1996-1997 Reunion and recorded another Alive album from that tour; that at least would've been more true to form and memorable.<br /><br />And don't even get me started about the \\"Alive IV Symphony\\" fiasco...
B00006JDU9|5.0|Before I start on this review, let me tell you that I am a relatively new fan of star wars, so my opinions may be slightly different than those loyal fans who have been with these movies from the very begining.<br /><br />I saw this film a few days after watching the original trilogy, and although I still prefer the original, I think this is amazing too. It is incredible to see Annakin Skywalker as that little innocent boy, and unnerving to remember what he becomes. It goes to show how even the most evil villains began life as a normal person. They weren't born evil.<br /><br />The plot is interesting, and I think the acting is pretty good. But my favourite thing about the movie is seeing the younger versions of everyone, what they were like before they became the well known charactors we know today. Obi Wan seemed so different from that confident and expereinced old man that you meet in episode 4, but Annakin still amazes me the most. Throughout all the movie I just kept remembering his face in episode 6, when Luke removed his mask, and wondering how could anyone so sweet become something so pitiless and cruel? It was kind of sad.<br /><br />Overall, I give this film a 5, because even though it wasn't as good as the originals, it was still a very good film.
B00005JNEI|1.0|If you have any inteligence at all, you will not waste your time on this garbage. I wish that I could give it less than one star. Mr. Moore is full of B.S. It takes very little time to research the material to see that most of his \\"facts\\" are LIES. There is no truth in this \\"movie\\", it should be listed under fiction. If you watched any T.V. during and after 9/11 you would know there is no truth in this \\"movie\\". It's full of misquotes and outright lies. Moore should not call Bush a \\"liar\\" while he himself is lying. One example, Moore says \\"There are no terrorists\\" well I don't know about anyone else but when I turned on my television on September 11 2001, and seen two hijacked planes crashing into the Towers, I damn sure believed there were terrorists in this world. If he is right and there isn't then how come New York has a different skyline? And where did those 3,000 people go? If there are \\"no terrorists\\" then why are those people dead? Come on give me a break! Tell the survivors there are no terrorists! Some one needs to introduce Michael Moore to reality!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Look folks, I really don't understand how anyone could really say that the film contains lies.  All th facts presented are true.  It's Moore's opinions drawn from these facts that people can choose to believe or not.  Moore presents the Bath connection and the connection to the Saudi royal family to support his claims that Bush's loyalty to the Saudis and the Bin Ladens presents a strong conflict of interest in his dealings with terrorism pre and post 9/11.  Moore shows the way the military preys on the poor for recruiting.  He supports his claim that the terrorist threat to the US is not what the Bush administration would like you to believe by showing the lack of protection at most of our borders.  When he talks about the 2000 election Moore shows the connections Bush had in Florida that helped him block the recount.  He presents strong arguments supported by facts, which is more than what can be said about the president.  There are a lot of reviews where people lament over all the \\"lies\\" in this film but don't present any examples.  You can disagree with Moore's conclusions, but I don't know how much better anybody else's conclusion would be.
B000059Z8J|5.0|We will miss you, Christopher Reeve, and we will mourn your passing as we would any other noble soul's.  We loved you as Superman, you were perhaps the only actor we would have \\"bought\\" in the role, both as dweeby Clark Kent and the chisel-chinned \\"Man of Steel,\\" and your floating over Metropolis taught us all that if we found the right love we too could fly.  You won America's heart playing the part with all the conviction and vulnerability in the world, and so when your riding accident happened we were there for you too and we cheered on your fight against immobility and pain.<br /><br />You fought against government inertia and inaction, and you made ordinary people aware of the great divide between the able-bodied and the disabled, a divide that doesn't have to exist.  In some ways you were even more splendid a hero in your later years than when you were mightier than a speeding bullet.  Losing you is an event we were none of us prepared for, because I think we were all expecting one day to see you walk again, so titanic were your reserves of heroism and courage.  Alas, that day was not to be, but now you are in the hall of the Valkyries, flying high overhead with the other heroes we have loved and lost.  Sail on, sail on, Superman!
0679735909|5.0|I had read all of A.S. Byatt's work, but avoided \\"Possession\\" because it was a bestseller, and I somehow thought that meant it would be a lesser work. I was mistaken. This is a masterpiece. When I finished the last page I just *embraced* this book. I wish I could read it for the first time again.
0780020685|5.0|The idle child is asked, \\"If you pity these suffering villagers so much, why don't you help them yourself?\\"    Then the flashes of illumination dawn upon us.  A scoundrel, a gambler, a rotten peddlar understands and expounds the glory of sacrifice in a sudden moment of revelation.    In an age of boundless materialism and hostility, it is a breath of the freshest air to absorb a film like this one.  Its pace, its peace, its glorious morals shine on the heart and remind us of our fellowman, of his beauty, of his likeness to us.  We are reminded of the virtues of Love.    Through powerful strokes of artistry, the greatest movies invite us to reflection, to learn more about ourselves and our world.  In this light, Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is an epic invitation to fall in love with humanity all over again, to realize the glory of sacrificing ourselves for our brothers and sisters, and to pick the sword in the most honourable ways that we might finally know what it means to love and to be loved.    This is, personally speaking, my most cherished cinematic experience and one which moves me in new ways each time I watch it.  With this, his masterpiece, Kurosawa has achieved something unique: art which transcends its own medium, which elaborates the human condition with genuine compassion, purpose, experience.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|Ok, most people say the 2nd and 3rd films \\"suck\\" or \\"were terrible.\\" I liked the series and I thought they were very cool with the point that they were trying to make which is pretty bland except for a great action series. ANYWAY, WHERE IS THE DAMN DTS!!!!! I own a home theatre system and i used to show it off with the original matrix until i got titles like JURASSIC PARK in DTS and GLADIATOR in DTS and the holy grail for DTS and sound enthusists everywhere SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. I CAN F**KING WATCH THE BREAKFAST CLUB in DTS but no matrix. Someone explain please
B0001YRVN4|4.0|All 3 classic are on this DVD. Digitally remastered with better picture and sound. It has a one level demo of battlefront, for all of you with an Xbox, a 9 minute preview of episode III, a 150 minute documentary on the star wars  films, and more. I bought this DVD because I wanted to see the 9 minute preview of episode III and I wanted to see how much better the sound and picture were. I'm glad I bought this because Now I don't have to rewing or anything when I wanna see a certain part. Also, Hayden's body has replaced Sebastian Shaw's in Return of the Jedi. I think that is alot better because technically, \\"Anakin\\" died early in episode III. Vader dies in return of the jedi. Trust me, you want to but this DVD.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|must admit, I underestimated Ashton Kutcher's talent. In fact, the reason I refused to see the film in theaters was because I thought that there was no way he could pull off a good performance. Yes, I was wrong. Though I do not think the role that he played was too hard, I do think that he was more than suitable to star the role.<br /><br />In this provacative film, Kutcher plays the role of a person who is basically able to travel through time which in turn, alters the outcome of his life, as well as the lives of the people closest to him. In his youth, he represses a lot of disturbing memories, but keeps them stuffed in journals, in hopes it may decrease the number of blackouts that he has (which seemd to come conveniently at times when he'd cause trouble). By the time he reaches college, the blackouts are gone. Then one night, he stumbles across one of his old journals and reads it aloud, resulting in his first blackout in years. He soon discovers that he holds the power to travel through time back! In particular, he is able to race back through time to the points in his life where he blacked out. He plays with his power and learns that he can change the past and does so multiple times in order to change the future--mostly to change the outcome of a person he loves most. It seems as though no matter how many times he goes back to change something, it all leads to something dramatically different than what he expected.<br /><br />Entertaining and mind boggling. The art in this film does not necessarily come from the cinematography, the editing techniques, or the directing in particular. I would say this is more of a film that challenges the mind to think about the longterm consequences of our actions. Something so technical as the words and the order that we use them could in turn effect the outcome of a person's life. Even more so, one action at a single stage in a youth's life can dramatically effect the outcomes of others. I'd recommend to everyone to at least watch this film once...I believe it did it wonderful job to send out its message.east watch this film once...I believe it did it wonderful job to send out its message. <br />

B00005JMAH|4.0|Well, it made me sad to see so many people dissing on poor Alfonso Cuaron, so I thought I'd try to lighten up the situation a little bit. <br /> <br />I honestly like Prisoner of Azkaban more than the first two movies.  I know, time to dodge the tomatoes right?  But let's be serious.  When any book becomes a movie, you have to anticipate that things won't be able to translate perfectly and communicating the same story in a 2-3 hour time limit is rather difficult.  Just look at Lord of the Rings.  They failed to mention a character entirely for the sake that Arwen could rescue Frodo in the first movie, but I rarely hear anyone having fits over that. <br /> <br />I think Alfonso took what he needed, the essence of the Harry Potter book, and made that into a fun and exciting movie for the kids that love the books.   <br /> <br />What's more, Alfonso created a whole new world for Hogwarts. The artistic qualities of the sets and cinematography are something the first two directors failed to really create. <br /> <br />The only people I hear talking about how horrible the movie was is the older fans, and lets face it, the movies are created with a younger audience in mind, and obviously they're still happy as ever with the third installment. <br /> <br />So if you are a Harry Potter fan or parent of said fan, while the movie is not the same as the book word for word and scene for scene, Prisoner of Azkaban is still a great choice.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|I think those that are true Prince fans must understand that he is forever changing along with his music. What do you think what kept him in the game so long? He is unique and so is his music. Besides if he never changed his style he would just be another boring artist.Prince doesn't compete with other artists he competes with himself and that is what makes him great. Just like The Rainbow Children.
B00062IDCO|5.0|Here we are, it is May 2001--September 11th is 4 months away.  The America that I grew up with faced an uncertain future as we were not sure where we were heading with this new president who came to office under none of the best circumstances.  The dot-com bubble was bursting and people who made money off of it were realizing that this was just all paper to begin with.  This is the backdrop of the end of \\"Star Trek:  Voyager\\" as a TV series.  This was the first of the \\"Star Trek\\" series where I saw it from beginning to end as it was aired.  This was the season where they were going to tie loose ends up. <br /> <br />Communications between Starfleet and Voyager strengthened as Barclay found a way to contact Voyager in the Delta Quadrant.  We would find Neelix leaving to stay with a colony of Telaxians in an asteroid field where he would stay with the woman of his dreams and then become the Federation Ambassador to the Delta Quadrant. <br /> <br />As usual, the season began with a cliffhanger as Janeway and crew find themselves needing to outwit the Borg.  It even required Janeway, Tuvok and Torres to become assimilated in order to do it.  Speaking of Borg, 7 of 9 and Chakotay discovery they have feelings for each other and that might pose problems at the final episode. <br /> <br />The importance of heading home weighs most heavily on Tuvok, when he discovers he has a disease that can only be cured by brain tissue from a member of his family--which would be very simple if they were in the Alpha Quadrant, but not so simple in the Delta Quadrant. <br /> <br />Of course, there is later in the season a pregnant Torres, who winds up giving birth to hers and Paris' first child in the final episode, as Voyager manages her way out of a Borg Ship sent by the Queen to stop Janeway from taking a transwarp conduit home. <br /> <br />At the end, it was great that they ended the series the way that they did--they finally made it home inside a Borg Ship that they wind up destroyingfrom the inside at Wolf-359 in front of a Federation fleet not sure what they would encounter.  \\"Endgame\\" also displayed Janeway's continuing obsession with finding a way home and that even after she got there, she was finding a way to get her crew home faster in another timeline. <br /> <br />What happened to the crew after they arrived?  We know about Janeway--for some reason, Starfleet promoted her to Admiral, where we would see her reprise her role in \\"Star Trek:  Nemesis\\".  She should have faced a court martial and/or a board of inquiry first for getting that ship and that crew lost in the badlands 7 years earlier.  Whereas\\"DS9\\" seemed sentimental and sappy in its final episode, we find \\"Voyager\\" triumphant--destroying the Borg (...or did they?) and getting home in 7 years as opposed to the original 16.
B000002BHE|5.0|Man i just luv Celine's CD's aye. This CD is really cool, i really luv River Deep, Mountain High- that is such a cool song! this CD is really good. anyway, i'll just give you the basics of my faves on this CD:    Dreamin' Of You- One of my personal favourites, probably my second, very beautiful song.    Falling into You-  Title Track Song, very cool ballad i guess you would call it..    Call the Man- Another of my faves, very beautiful song, probably my fourth fave song    I Just Don't Know- Probably my third favourite, very good song    River Deep, Mountain High- originally by Tina Turner, my absolute favourite song on this album    and those are just a few of the songs. Mrs Dion has definitely done an excellant job in the making of this CD.

B0000BYM3K|2.0|Brave New World has to be one of the greatest comebacks for a metal band ever.  It featured a combination of classic, fast Maiden with a newer, melodic, and ultimately progressive Maiden.  The album did a great job of balancing these two different approaches to the music.  Dance of Death, however, is complete melodramatic overkill. <br /> <br />Wildest Dreams is Maiden's worst album opener since Futureal, and Rainmaker, despite a catchy chorus, sounds more like a Christian rock anthem than Iron Maiden.  No More Lies is a good song, but it takes nearly three minutes to get going, which is just ridiculous.  With Montsegur we get our first taste of old-fashioned Maiden on the album.  It's a great, heavy rocker where every single instrument is audible (unlike much of the album), and therefore sounds fantastic.  My only complaint is the chorus, where Bruce goes way over the top with the falsetto thing.   <br /> <br />Dance of Death is Maiden's silliest song since The Angel and the Gambler -  just look at those lyrics.  The solos are good, though.  If the title track is one of Maiden's silliest, then Gates of Tomorrow is simply one of their worst.  New Frontier is a step up, but not enough to save the midsection of the album.  At least it isn't laughable, unlike the previous song. <br /> <br />Paschendale is an epic war song which has such incredible composition and guitarwork that it's a shame its wasted on the terrible production on this album.  Again, Bruce's vocals aren't up to par, either.  Face in the Sand features some synth overkill and really over the top vocals.  Age of Innocence is the album's most underrated song, and also one of the best.  Thundering guitars, adequate vocals, and an old-fashioned chorus make this one really stand out and overcome the simplistic lyrics.  Journeyman is an acoustic song that's relatively uninteresting. <br /> <br />This album bears little resemblance to classics like Number of the Beast and Powerslave.  It's a more pretentious Maiden than we've seen before, except maybe with the disastrous X Factor.  The orchestral effects are cheesy and overbearing and Bruce's voice is simply too high and even a little scratchy.  The production muddles the guitars, bass, and drums together and creates a confused, murky sound.  The annoying Celtic influence that the band has inexplicably maintained since The X Factor doesn't help, either.  Only get this one if you're a diehard fan.
6304362498|5.0|Look, few movie adaptations ever touch the book (Jaws, The Shawshank Redemption are exceptions) but that is no reason to go into a book-adaptation looking for the flaws and differences inherent in turning a brilliant piece of literature into a film.  Take this movie for what it is, an exceptional adaptation and piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have agaisnt the film is that it might be a little confusing to a viewer who hasn't read the book.  However, I truly mean that that's my only complaint about the film.  John Hurt is spectacular as Winston Smith, perfectly displaying Winston's inner turmoil and gaunt appearance.  Eqaully spectacular is Richard Burton, in his final film role, as the enigmatic O'Brien.  Suzanna Hamilton is decent as Julia, not unrealistically beautiful and with a flippant sense of rebellion that is her charm.  The sets of a bombed out London are extremely convincing: never does the viewer question this decrepit and depressing dystopia.<br /><br />Although some of the things added to the film were surprising (the physical crossing of the arms to make a \\"V\\"), some actually improved on the novel, an example being the set-up of Winston's deep fear for rats.  The physical likeness of Big Brother, an amalgam of historical tyrants, is well done, and the soundtrack (done by Eurythmics of all people) perfectly suits the film.  If you loved the book, you owe it to yourself to see this.  9/10
6304712936|5.0|After only being able to see the Director's Cut, I just had a chance to view the original theatrical cut of Amadeus, and now, I'm able to compare both versions.<br /><br />This is my review of the Director's Cut.<br /><br />This Academy-Award winning film based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791), my favorite composer of all time, is very well done, in terms of costume and set design (as well as the make-up job on F. Murray Abraham, who won the Oscar Best Actor, beating out his fellow actor Tom Hulce, who portrayed the man who was \\"Beloved Of God.\\") The brief bits of opera which were shown were staged very well by the legendary Twyla Tharp (especially \\"Don Giovanni\\"). For that and the utter beauty and timelessness music of the Master itself, I give it three stars. I withold the fourth and fifth stars because of some HUGE historical inaccuracies AND the unneccessary nude scene (inserted for the Director's Cut). I shall begin.<br /><br />I. I have read several biographies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, including one by Victor Seroff, and NEVER did I read of Mozart cheating on Constanze (as is implied in the film) or vice versa. If Mozart had done such a thing, his wife would have left him and, as far as I know, she did not desert him for another man (she married again after his death after waiting the decent interval).<br /><br />II. Constanze and Mozart had six children, of which only two survived to adulthood (but they never produced children of their own). In the film, only one child is depicted (I'm not sure which, as he is never named in the damn picture). Serious blunder.<br /><br />III. Constanze NEVER destroyed any of Mozart's work; in fact, she published them herself, recognizing her husband's God-given gift to write sublime music.<br /><br />IV. Mozart was a vulgar man, as shown, but he \\"Never spoke a crude or coarse word\\" to Constanze, as the movie clearly shows.<br /><br />V. The scene where Constanze undresses in front of Salieri was unneccessary and NOT TRUE. Constanze loved Mozart with all her heart and would NEVER have done such an atrocious thing.<br /><br />VI. Mozasrt DID NOT die in the morning. He died on the night of December 4, 1791. That morning, he gave his pupil (somehow, the movie skipped the fact that he HAD pupils) Franz Sussmayr instructions for the completion of the \\"Requiem Mass\\" and that night, the great Mozart died. According to a photograph I saw (and the biography I mentioned earlier in my first point), he died surrounded by his family. He was given a pauper's funeral because HIS FAMILY WAS POOR, NOT because a noble (Baron Von Sweiten, in the play and movie; they omitted his line for the funeral from the script for the movie) sugessted that it was \\"Vain Show.\\"<br /><br />VII. Why the devil would Salieri want to help Mozart, if his ultimate aim was to destroy him \\"By any means neccessary\\"? THERE IS NO PROOF OF THAT!! Please see my previous point for more information on this.<br /><br />VIII. Mozart briefly taught the young Ludwig Von Beethoven (1770-1827) and immediately recognized his genius. Another HUGE error in not depicting this fact, though the boy Mozart winks at during the masquerade ball whilst performing is supposed to be the young composer (another error, as Beethoven was seventeen years of age when he probably met Mozart, with the composer recognising the young man's genius and saying to his friends, 'Keep an eye on this young man. He will make a noise in the world some day.')<br /><br />IX. At the masquerade ball, Schikanedar requests that Mozart play their little tune in the manner of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Even though Mozart knew of Bach's music through his friendship with Johann Christian Bach, Bach's music was unknown to mostly everyone in the late 18th century. Also, Mozart says that Gluck is boring, and he didn't like Handel. In fact, Gluck & Handel were two of Mozart's favourite composers, and he even arranged some of Handel's works, including his famous oratorio 'Messiah.'<br /><br />Excellent period piece, but I DO NOT recommend it as a history lesson. The nude scene, as I stated earlier, was unneccessary and has no basis in actual fact. Rated R for crude behaviour, suggestive content, moderate language and brief nudity.<br /><br />Now, for my thoughts on the theatrical cut.<br /><br />As originally released to cinemas 30 years ago, Amadeus is a brilliant, though somwwhat inaccurate (see above) historical drama. The scenes deleted from the film don't really serve a purpose, and it's a good thing they were cut, especially the nude scene, which made no sense at all (story wise and from a historical perspective, as noted above). Also, the scene where Salieri finds out that Mozart & Katerina had a tryst ends perfectly in the theatrical release, and the scene where Constanze goes to Salieri to implore him for a post on Mozart's behalf was perfectly edited in the theatrical cut. It makes Salieri seem cold-blooded as the rest of the movie shows, and Constanze is not made out to be a whore, as is in the Director's Cut (see above). I'm also sure that Mozart was not vulgar in public, as it's inconceivable that even a wunderkind could have gotten anywhere in the world, had he acted like that without the privacy of his own house. Historical evidence also shows that Mozart and his father had a good, though strained, relationship (particularly regarding Constanze).<br /><br />Best to regard this film as historical fiction.<br /><br />Rated PG for some crude behaviour, moderate language and suggestive content.<br /><br />My advice: stick with the theatrical cut and view the Director's Cut once.lesson.

B000001GK9|4.0|This is the first recording of Mahler's music I ever heard.  I was a relative newcomer to classical music at the time and thankfully had no idea the \\"experts\\" had christened this the greatest of all Mahler ninths.  Well, years later I can see why they say that; this is assuredly one of the most beautifully played performances, but is it really the best?   <br /> <br />Maybe the Karajan worshippers think so, but let's not delude ourselves -- they loved everything karajan did, even his laughable baroque recordings.  Yes, Karajan gave us a good -- at moments great -- interpretation here, but it is not the best, or the \\"ultimate Mahler 9.\\"  All of the great symphonies demand alternative views, and we would be cheating ourselves by locking into just one vision of a work.   <br /> <br />So, may I suggest Leonard Bernstein's Mahler Ninth, also a live recording, and also with the Berlin Philharmonic.  Karajan may have introduced me to Mahler's Ninth, but Bernstein helped me make it my own.  Whereas Karajan is more aesthetically pleasing to behold, and lays out the logic of the piece, Bernstein's is a more dramatic, visceral, and apocalyptic experience.  Bernstein's performance really burns in the soul, while Karajan is just a bit cooler, and seeks to smooth over the jagged edges of the music.  Karajan wants to cure Mahler of his neurosis while Berstein is suffering with him.   <br /> <br />The ensemble is not immaculate as with Karajan, but Mahler is not Mozart, and if you are a stickler for precision, then Mahler's probably not your man anyway.  Caution: Avoid Bernstein's dreary Concertgebouw reading on DG -- his Berlin recording is the one to get.  <br /> <br />Unfortunaltely the folks at DG are still charging top dollar for both the Karajan and Bernstein versions.  Bruno Walter on Sony  is great for those on a budget, and I've heard good things about Bernstein's earlier New York version, also on Sony at midprice.  David Hurwitz recommends Ancerl and the Czech Philharmonic on Supraphon, and I trust him over the Penguin Guide any day.       <br /> <br />
B0002QXAD6|5.0|Now people know why the Orchestra used here won any Ocser for best Score in a movie. :) <br /> <br />Ok know on to the CD it's self. <br /> <br />1. Dark Chest of Wonders: Nightwish always starts off with a heavy song. That has never changed. I found this to be a very good song. I love how the guiter is used right from the get go. I also like how choir is used. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Wish I Had An Angel: This is very different for Nightwish. I don't really know what you would call. It's metal but I don't really know what kind of metal. This is also the first of four songs that Marco sings in. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Nemo: This was there first single. It's a good song and makes good use of the orchestra. I like it but it's not there best song. It's not as heavy, but it's also not that slow. 8/10 <br /> <br />4. Planet Hell: This song starts not with guitersor drums or any other member of Nightwish. It starts with the choir and the orchestra. Marco starts singing here and then Tarja starts in. Great heavy song. Far more heavy then Wish I Had An Angel. 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Creek Mary's Blood: I like this song. Nightwish got John Two-Hawks to preform with them for this one. This is also the first song where the orchestra really seem like they were in the same place at the same time. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. The Siren: Tarja singings a few lines here. The rest is Marco singing and the band and the orchestra singing. 10/10 <br /> <br />7. Dead Gardens: The first of two heavy songs in a row. It is very good. The last minute has some very heavy riffs. It's a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Romanticide: Best heavy song that Nightwish has every done. Marco has a really great part at the end of the song. This is for metal fans. If you don't like heavy songs like this then pass over it. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Ghost Love Score: This song uses Nightwish, the orchestra, and the choir. It is very long and would fit great into a movie. 10/10 <br /> <br />10. Kuolema Tekee Taiteitijan: This is song in finnish. So it's hard to know what they are saying. The orchestra is just used here. 7/10 <br /> <br />11. Higher Than Hope: This song is for a fan of theres that they knew very well. He dead so this song is for him. It is a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />12. White Night Fantasy: This song is odd. It is Nightwish playing. But it does not sound like a Nightwish song. I just have to hear it for your self. 7/10
B00005BCOL|5.0|Between Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer (who were famously enemies at the MGM Studio) and Rosiland Russel, this film is a Must-See movie which stars an all-woman cast (no men in this movie) who are catty, bitchy, back-stabbing, and gossipy. The fashion show is amazing. There is no person who shouldn't see this movie.
B0000025YM|4.0|This is classic music here folks. It's my third favorite Judas Priest album behind \\"Painkiller\\" and \\"Sad wings of Destiny\\".  <br /> <br />This gem is full of many masterpieces. The classic fast rocker \\"Freewheel Burning. The song that will get any rocker pumped up \\"Rock Hard Ride Free\\". The last two tracks Heavy Duty/Defenders of Faith is always sun to listen to also. <br /> <br />Classic album. You must buy!
B000002L42|3.0|I have seen Steely Dan live a few times, though not on the 1993/1994 tour, from which this live set comes. On the one hand, in a Steely Dan concert you know what to expect beforehand, namely the songs will be recreated as closely as possible as the studio version, which in a way is nice, comforting perhaps. On the other hand, you wish for something unpredictable to happen with the live arrangements, and it never happens, but for the rare guitar solo or horn solo. In the lines notes Donald Fagen writes, when asked why they decided to tour again after so many years: \\"We wanted to hear what 'Babylon Sisters' would sound like live\\". Good enough for me, but then again you could've replied \\"it just sounds like the studio version\\".<br /><br />\\"Alive in America\\" (11 tracks, 66 min.) provides pleasing versions of some of Steely Dan's best known tracks, including \\"Babylon Sisters\\", \\"Bodhisattva\\", a swinging \\"Peg\\" (one of my all-time fave Steely songs), \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" and even oldie \\"Reelin' in the Years\\" is included. The best is saved for the very last, namely a 9 min. majestic version of \\"Aja\\", just beautiful. For the Steely completists, also included is \\"Book of Liars\\", one of the few Steely Dan songs ever where Walter Beckett sings lead.<br /><br />In all, this is certainly not a \\"necessary\\" purchase for the Steely Dan fan. But if you've seen them live, this is a nice souvenir, nothing more nothing less.
B000063DI8|3.0|\\"No Prayer for the Dying\\", the 8th studio album made by Iron Maiden truly does have some quality tracks, yet it is not up to par with most of the other Maiden albums. If you take this album and compare it to Maiden's 7th studio album \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\", it's really a no contest. <br /> <br />The good tracks on the album are \\"Tailgunner\\", \\"Run Silent Run Deep\\", \\"Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter\\", and \\"Mother Russia\\". And just about all of the songs on \\"Seventh Son\\" are better then those 4. \\"Bring your Daughter...to the Slaughter\\" is a hit single from Maiden, and it is more of a fun joking type song, something that we don't really see from them very often. \\"Mother Russia\\" is my favorite from those 4, and it is a great way to end the album.  <br /> <br />Another one that I like alot is \\"Hooks in You\\", the thrid song from the Charlotte the Harlot series. It's actually the worst of the 4, but it is still a fun catchy quality song. <br /> <br />The rest aren't very good. Song titles like \\"Public Enema Number One\\" can really tell you why.
B0002OERI0|5.0|i loved the album and ive been listening to it nonstop for days now. it takes a few listens to really understand, but billie joes lyrics never cease to amaze me. everyone has pretty much said everything im thinking. <br /> <br />sorry but i had to post this one comment on the reviews that talk about greenday selling out or not being punk anymore. these annoy me greatly, but NOT because their views are different than mine, but becuase they are clearly elitist snobs and need to get over themselves. lets stop worrying so much about wahts punk or not and just love the music for what it IS. so i thought id share this section of an online interview, straight from the mouths of the band.... <br /> <br />GW [Magazine]: What's it like to have to live up to someone else's definition of punk. Or being told that you've betrayed that ideal? <br /> <br />ARMSTRONG: I can't think of anything less punk than establishing a set of rules. I don't set any rules on myself. I don't live up to anybody's expectations. I'm totally self-sufficient. That's what punk is about to me, not some elitist attitude. I'm not an elitist at all. I have different kinds of friends. I'm into strange people and different lifestyles. Even if someone is a Republican, I could still sit down and have a discussion with him and talk about life. I think the elitist, maximumrockandroll punks are a lot more conservative than Republicans. <br /> <br />DIRNT: They're afraid of change. <br /> <br />
B00005OWEG|5.0|I think this movie is a masterpiece of cinematography-period. This is not really so much a war movie as it is a study in human nature. If you are looking for a war movie see \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\" This is a visual translation of Joseph Conrad's book \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and it amazes me how many so-called fans of this movie don't even know that. The book can be a very difficult read and has ignited over 80 years of debate among literary critics as to its real meaning. The movie does a faithful job explaining the journey of one man into the heart of darkness. This isn't so much a movie about a commando on an assassination mission as it is a story of a journey into madness, despair and the battle of good vs. evil within us all. This movie transcends the mundane explanation of war and delves into the psychology of man the animal while doing an excellent job of comparing it to man the divine. This version does have many deleted scenes not included in the 1st that will only really be spotted and appreciated by fans of the original. If you understand the philosophy of the original movie you will definitely appreciate this movie, otherwise you might just think this makes an already long movie drag out even more. The additional footage of the French plantation is a priceless additional as it truly conveys the ultimate futility of war as cryptically shares with us certain facts of the Vietnam War not readily known by the public and easily misunderstood as conjecture by historians. It gives us a unique perspective into the French story as they were occupiers of this selfsame land before we were and were driven out with equal determination. The dialogue is a bit wordy and the accents of the actors really hard to understand, but it adds more texture to the story by far. The true meaning of this movie will become lost to those who are unaware there is one. All in all a masterpiece of a psychological thriller whose true horror is heard again when one reflects eerily of the situationin Iraq today, for mans causes and ideologies may vary, but the motives always seem to stay the same. A true classic.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My boyfriend recommended this movie to me.  At first I was not very interested because it was Anime.  I had never watched a movie like this before.  You have to have some prior knowledge of Japanese customs to fully comprehend the concept of this movie.  There are points in this movie where it makes you jump.  Some scenes you feel so bad for the characters.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a sensitive yet slightly action-filled movie.  This is really a great movie.  I liked it so much that I bought it a week after I first saw it, and as you can see its no cheap buy. But I recommend that you get yourself a copy, it's worth it.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is what classic albums are made of. Just plain gorgeous. The lyrics are so beautiful and thought provoking, I've literally stopped in my tracks to absorb them. Keane's sound is like if Queen fused together with Coldplay. It's simply lovely.
B00005JNEU|4.0|Friday Night Lights is being billed as the best sports movie ever made.  That's a hard title to live up to.  The problem with sports films is that they - almost by necessity - follow the same arc; the tough coach who nobody supports comes in to a small-town team and leads them to the state finals.  Could be the plot of Hoosiers, right? <br /> <br />What sets this film apart is that is based on true events.  Far from romanticizing the game, this movie makes the life of a high school football star seem like a nightmare.  It is too much of a responsibility to place on the shoulders of a 17-year-old to give meaning to an entire population's existence.  The director, Peter Berg, is an actor who is distinguishing himself with films like this and The Rundown.  He shows tremendous visual flare.  The movie has a documentary feel.  One of the great devices he uses is to have the constant talk radio chatter in the background; we know that the town's citizens feel that the problem with the local high school is that they \\"care too much about learnin'\\".   <br /> <br />I have never read the book, but I am told that the film is an accurate representation.  I am given to understand that they both capture what it is like for a small town sports star.  Even though it is hard to come up with new twists in sports movies, it does manage a few surprises.  It makes a fascinating and enjoyable movie.  <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie for many of the same reasons as the other reviewers, and some of my own. I picked this up on a whim from my local video store, and was blown away. Not only is the storyline compelling and somewhat shocking, the cinematography is such that it adds to and influences the viewers interpretation of the movie. The way they picture the characters doing drugs, for instance, is effective and unexpected. The turn of events is unpredictable, but not to the point where the movie gets confusing. Despite how desperate and ill (both mentally and physically) the characters may be, it is easy to pick out things about all of them that one can relate to. The message that the movie leaves you with is deep within the plot, and I am certain that it differs from person to person. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00005MP58|5.0|since i first read the book a few years ago, i became hooked and have endlessly read pride and prejudice over and over again. I dont get tired of it. The miniseries stayed true to the book and brought to life the characters i had come to know and love.
6305949980|4.0|This movie is a great classic for the gothic community. It's dark, funny, and doesn't take too much brain power to appreciate it. Being a Disney movie, of course it has a simple love story hidden within the chaos, but it isn't as sappy as the usual love story goes. It's actually quite refreshing.  <br />Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is simply fun. It shows how one should appreciate the small things in life and how you should always be yourself.
0385720920|3.0|This is an unforgettable book, and that's why I found it somewhat disapointing.  It's the story of Victor Mancini, a sex-addict developing a con scheme to pretend to choke in restaurants to pay for the medical care of his dying mother, and the author certainly pushes the envelope hard.  Victor had a wild childhood which consisted of his mother escaping from prison or metal institutions to teach him important life lessons while engaging in reckless activities such as stealing school buses.  Palahniuk creates a number of memorable scenes, especially those when he visits his dying mother.  A few chapters about Victor's sexual exploits come across as Penthouse letters taken to the highest possible art form.  There are numerous witty and scathing observations throughout the book.    The problem I found is that it never came together as a story.  The characters are effectively without much further dimension than their various dysfunction's.  Various scenes barely connect.  It becomes hard to care about these characters with a plot that barely hangs together, and the slightly gimmicky ending has a muddled payoff.  So as with Victor's countless sexual encounters, something is missing which prevents satisfaction at the climax.
B00006879E|1.0|I hate to admit that I was initially attracted by this band.  Adam Levine has an incredible voice and the musical orchestration was catchy, funky and cute.  But after a few more listens, I became really disappointed with the lyrics; they were trite, vapid and basically put together to link up with the musical phrasing.  There is no semblance of meaning behind any of their lyrics, and they read like a stream-of-consciousness diary entry written by a 9 year old.  For example, the much overplayed \\"She Will Be Loved\\" confuses pronouns (he, she, I) and point-of-view so much that it is completely divested of significance (just WHO are you asking to \\"look for the girl with the broken smile\\"?) and becomes an overbearing chore to listen to.  The horrible lyrics diminish the excellence of Levine's voice and the musical orchestration, which makes me wonder how good this band might be with some decent songwriting.
B000002LND|5.0|This CD has every essential Madonna hit you could dream of, from \\"Like a Virgin\\" to \\"Vogue\\" - it's one of those albums that you could listen to for the rest of your life, and it sounds superb on a stereo, with groundbreaking Q-sound technology.<br /><br />Also the album packaging is exquisite, featuring beautiful Madonna photos by Herb Ritts and a great write up on her career to that point. Great buy!
B00003CXS4|5.0|It is such a relief to see some unusual and interesting characters in a movie. This is a unique movie that takes you into an interesting world. It is so different than your usual world  that it makes you wish you had a real life. <br /> Get lost in this world and go to a different place. Isn't that why you see a movie. Live a little!
B0000C1733|5.0|This cd is beyond any cd I have ever heard. All these songs are unskippable and there's a reason this band has been around for so long. I have always liked TRHCP but never owned one of their cds I just heard there songs on the radio and just downloaded (legally of course) some of there songs. So when I saw the cd on the racks I just figured what the **** and just bought it. Starting with Under the Bridge and ending in a never before released song that equalled any of the songs on the cd. The cd was great but what was even greater, the greatest, was the DVD full of RHCP videos. For months, I souly rocked out to that cd and dvd. Run of the mill fans will like this and appreciate it. Just like this run of the mill fan turned into Chili pepper fanatic.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|Ever since George Fischer joined this band I have been utterly bored with Cannibal Corpse after Gallery of Suicide.  That was a very technical experimental album from the band.  Unfortunately since then the band has been overly repetitive, the lyrics have gotten stupid.  I loved Chris Barnes American Psycho style lyrics of murder and mayhem of the psychology of a serial killer.  At least on this album the lyrics try to go back to that atmosphere.  I wish they had guitarists like Rob Barrett back in the band.  You can clearly see the Bleeding and Vile were good with him being in the band. (For further reference get Malvolent [sic] Creation's new album.)  Perhaps the reason why Jack Owen left was because he felt he was stuck in a creative box.  I just can't get into the post-Barnes Cannibal Corpse.  Chris Barnes always brought a certain atmosphere to this band.  It's like Judas Priest withough Halford or Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson or for those who likes him Arch Enemy without Johan Liiva.

B00008NRI8|4.0|According to the tabloids, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant were not lovey-dovey on the set of Two Weeks Notice. But they certainly did have chemistry when acting together. Their timing was perfect and their characterizations made the movie. Both have wonderful facial expressions and body movements and used these to make the interaction come alive. For fun, laughter and entertainment watch this movie, then watch it again.
B00005JNEU|5.0|Friday Night Lights is by far one of the best football movies ever.  The only one that might best it is Remember the Titans.  I played football in high school and the movie captured the heart and emotion that all football players, not just those in Odessa, Texas feel.  Billy Bob Thornton played Gary Gaines pretty well I thought.  Although the movie did stray from the book at some points it was still an excellent film.  I do wish the movie went into the history of the town, school, and the football program some more.  Also it could have gone more into depth about the players lives off the field and how they were treated around town.  This DVD will definatly be part of my collection when it comes out.
B000005DSN|5.0|Stratovarius' 6th studio album, Visions (1997) is by far their best, having listened to \\"medleys\\" of all their albums from Fright Night to Infinite on their website, this one I liked best. Everyone plays their part best on this record. Vocalist Timo Kotipelto soars. Guitarist Timo Tolkki is amazing at freestyle and melody solos. Bassist Jari Kanulainen is perhaps my favorite bass player on the Finnish power metal scene, and a pretty big influence on me (I am a bass player.) Keys man Jens Johansson, who I think is the brother of Hammerfall drummer Anders Johansson, is amazing, he is not as good as Janne Wirman or Mikko Harkkin, but almost there. Drummer Jorg Michel is not the best of drummers, but as power metal goes, he's great.<br /><br />Perhaps the three highlights of the album are as follows: opener \\"Kiss Of Judas\\" is a great number, at a middle tempo, it's actually quite catchy. Second track, \\"Black Diamond,\\" is by far my favorite on the album, it features an eerie keyboard melody solo at the beginning, then becomes a fast, frantic thrasher. And \\"Coming Home\\" is easily the band's best ballad. I definetely plan on picking this up. A couple of other records I have that will definetely tide me over are Timo Kotipelto's first solo record, 'Waiting For The Dawn,' and the newest record from Sonata Arctica, 'Winterheart's Guild.' Other bands that might appeal to Strato-fans: Thunderstone, Nightwish, Children Of Bodom, et al. Just avoid Timo Tolkki's dreadfully un-metal solo stuff!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This concert exudes style on all fronts.The best filmed concert DVD i have ever seen.From the beggining, when the band is not yet on stage and we only seen the japanese crowd sitting, this feels like a stylish filmed movie.The definition on the image is incredible, plus is widescreen for those who care about it.The sound: inmaculate.The performance of the band is the best recorded on film and i believe is the best i have heard from James LaBrie.And i thought Scenes from New York on DVD was great! This show easily blows that fish out of the water:The stage is like 4 times bigger, the lights are like 4 times bigger in size and number.Hell! Even the screens on the back of the band are bigger and there are three of them!They even show much more better clips to go with the songs. <br />The bonus material is freaking great!I mean, Petrucci and Rudess telling everything about heir gear is great.Portnoy and his solo that then become plain funny (you will know what i mean)is also great.But what i found the most gratifying of the bonus features is the documentary (the discusion and rehearsals of The Number Of The Beast album from Maiden is a highlight)and the 5 angles that you could choose from to watch Instrumedley is beyond cool. <br />Bottom line: i could nitpick that the didn't play songs from Awake or that they did't play more from the Images and Words album.Or say that the case that holds the DVDs grab them TOO WELL and is complicated to extract them out of it.BUT the truth is that if you are a Dream Theater fan, you will be in musical heaven with this precious treasure of a DVD. <br />
B00005JKNC|5.0|I saw the promo for this film some time back, and I have been chasing a copy ever since. My main reason to get this DVD was Martin Landau. I totally loved the charm of the scenes involving Landau. The rest of the film was entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. I don't care that the film was in anyway political... the key thing for me was that I enjoyed Martin Landau's peformance immensely, and was pleasantly surprised that Carrey delivered a great  performance through the film. <br />Maybe I am a sucker for the \\"B\\" film, but in this case, the \\"B\\" stands for Beautiful. Totally worth it to see Landau, and the supporting cast is stellar.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I have been into Marillion for many years and I can honestly say that Marbles ranks right up there with sheer emotion and intense dark edge music as well as some very mellow and beautiful music too. So much that I would compare this to Brave and Afraid of Sunlight in production and overall creativity. It captures the magic and should not be labeled (like much of their music) as just Prog Rock. I can't think of many bands that are so great live and have such authentic and original vocals as in the case of singer Steve Hogarth. I do agree that Marbles needs multiple listens for some people to really appreciate as well as it is the kind of album that works even better when played start to finish(like Brave). But there are several tracks that deserve single attention and have already in Europe. Don't Hurt Yourself and You're Gone are two standouts of that as well as Fantastic Place(I think they should have released this one as thier 3rd single personally instead of The Damage.) The long Track Neverland is really amazing and probably one of 2 or 3 standouts on the album individually as well. Steve Rothery's guitar playing is one of the most amazing things I have ever heard in 31 years of Music listening. Maybe only David Gilmour of Pink Floyd is even close in that particular style.(wish he was doing more these days but he is almost 60 I think) I think you will enjoy this album and of course I want everyone to buy the 2 disc version. But before you go and get it from a friend or maybe online from somewhere I think people should buy it from the band directly through their website because with a Fan-based band like this it is nice to put a couple bucks in the plate of these musicians directly because I can tell you it really does go right to them as they have produced and managed themselves nicely the last few years. It really makes you feel you are involved in something special and important to give direct support to the band. But however you can....get it now!
6305897786|5.0|Before Seeing this film, read LE CLUB DUMAS. The writers of the film teased out one aspect of the book, brought together some elements, and expunged others. <br />The film on it's own is superb, and if you read the book as well, you will see the film in an even more awe-inspiring light. <br />Both Book and film have many layers, many depths. <br />The DVD  commentary is fun, and quite enjoyable ... almost like you are sitting down with Polanski and watching the film together. <br /> <br />In so many ways, the palette used in both mediums is somehow cross-hatched. An absolute delight to watch, and an absolute joy to read. I wish I could read LE CLUB DUMAS in the original language, since I have been told of some of the verbal puns that Polanski plays with visually, but I have to make do with the english... but the translation is beautifully and lovingly done. <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This album is every bit as good as other reviewers have asserted. I know from reading other reviews on Amazon.com that certain people can't stand the thought of five stars being given out, because nothing is five-stars perfect, etc. Boring! This album is amazing and deserves its rating. The songwriting is raw; the delivery is honest; and the recording, in all its reverbed/room-ambience glory, is sublime. This album is full of dynamic musicianship and feels honest-to-God like something was experienced in the studio. It does sound like the Pixies; it also sounds like the Black Heart Procession, Roxy Music, etc. It sounds like those bands and many others because they've all made great music. But reference points are not necessary; this record's appeal goes much further than splendor by association. There's a strong chance you'll love this regardless of what other albums will keep it company on your music shelves.
B00005JMH2|5.0|I saw a sneak preview of \\"Shall We Dance?\\" tonight and I loved it!  It was one of the best movies that I have seen in a while.  Richard Gere was great!  The movie was funny and sweet.  One minute I was laughing and the next I had tears in my eyes.  My favorite part had to be when he came up the escalater dressed in a tux and carrying a single red rose.  He took my breath away.  I really enjoyed the dancing in the movie.  All in all it was a great movie. I will definitely go see it again!
B00005JN7O|3.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a homage to the \\"air comics\\" of the '40s, in which daring aviators battled dastardly villains, the fate of the free world - and sometimes just the world - resting in their sure and steady hands. Parts of this movie are absolute delights for fans of the old air comics. Spotting the influences is fun. Jude Law plays H. Jospeh \\"Joe\\" Sullivan, the Sky Captain, leader of a band of mercenary - though America friendly, of course - airmen, obviously inspired by the Blackhawks, a very popular comic of the '40s (and even later though not so popular) about a band of mercenary - though America friendly, of course - airmen. The enemy aircraft with hinged, flapping wings remind one of Birdy, the batwing airplane from Airboy. One of the movie's most elegant images, a flying aircraft carrier, comes from a somewhat later comic, the '60s Nick Fury, Agent of SHIELD.    All the backgrounds in this film are CGI. It works. The imagery is convincing, imaginative, and beautiful. The entire movie is set in pastel tones that, while not technically black and white, evoke the feel of an old black and white movie. This almost monochrome look makes the few spots of color, like Polly Perkins' lipstick, the Union Jack on Franky Cook's ship, etc. really stand out. Visually it's hard to fault this movie.    The worst thing you can say about SC&TWOT (that cost it a full two stars with me) is that its two main characters are weak. Though I like Jude Law as an actor, and I'm happy to see his recent success, he simply comes across as too pretty and wimpy to be a tough-as-nails leader of men like Joe Sullivan. This role calls for an actor with the charisma and roguish charm of a young Harrison Ford, and Jude Law ain't it. Reporter Polly Perkins is simply a....well, you know that word that begins with \\"b\\" and rhymes with witch? She's self-centered, deceitful, untrustworthy, a serial liar, pushy, verbally and even physically abusive, and impossible to like, sympathize with, root for, or even enjoy her company for any extended period of time. Joe Sullivan has to have a hole in his head for (a) taking her along on this adventure - she nearly gets him killed, again and again, and (b) finding her attractive. I mean, really, all this woman has going for her as a human being is that she looks exactly like Gwyneth Paltrow. As I said earlier, it's hard to fault this movie visually - the filmmakers just needed to put more interesting, admirable people in front of all the pretty pictures.    The good news here is Angelina Jolie as Commander Francesca \\"Franky\\" Cook, a British fighter jock/commander of the aforementioned flying aircraft carrier who comes to Joe and Polly's aid. Angelina-as-Franky has more charisma and cool than Joe and Polly put together - and she pulls off the Brit accent well. Franky Cook is distilled grace under pressure, a take charge officer, but still so all about loving adventure she has a little girl grin for Joe just before they take off into danger. Given the option of Polly or Franky, only a fool would choose the former. And Angelina Jolie looks great in Franky Cook's head-to-toe black uniform. Franky Cook was obviously inspired by a '40s air comic character called the Black Angel, a gorgeous raven-haired female British fighter pilot who dressed all in black. Replace the Black Angel's hood with a black eye patch and you've got Franky Cook.    Unfortunately Franky's not in that much of the movie, then it's back to more witchy Polly and wimpy Joe. If ever there's a sequel to Sky Captain, it should be called Sky Commander and focus on one Commander Franky Cook, aka Angelina Jolie.

0316168815|4.0|It's difficult to classify The Lovely Bones as a mystery.  On the first page, the reader discovers that the narrator is dead, has been murdered, and by whom.  I suppose the mystery is in watching the family of Susie, the victim, find out what we the reader already know. <br /> <br />Rather, this is a human interest story.  Sebold delves into the ways that a family and community deals with tragedy.  Some never move on, some forget easily.  Some see the dead in the living.  Some go on a quest to solve the mysteries of other dead young women.  Some families break under the strain. <br /> <br />Certainly the story is a tragic one; in an age of Amber alerts and where images of missing young women flood our news shows, The Lovely Bones is a timely story.  These true life stories parallel this fictional one in many ways; the communities have pulled together, people with no connection to the deceased feel one after her death, etc. <br /> <br />A touching novel, The Lovely Bones will make you feel for the characters.  You will celebrate in their triumphs and recoil in their miseries.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I really enjoyed the first Star Wars movie \\"A New Hope\\". I enjoyed how George Lucas developed the storyline by taking past experiences that had not been covered, such as leaving the open ended question on who Luke Skywalker's parents really were. I also think that I can relate to Luke being a older teenager and growing up within a matter of months. I thought the Mos Eisley sequence was done very well. I do like very much what Lucas did in the re-release of the films. I think the small add-ins did a lot for the film. Overall I would strongly recomend this film to any film buff or sci-fi buff.
B0001XWV12|4.0|I thought that euro trip was a very funny movie with a catchy song in it. It was alot like Dude wheres my car in how the main characters go on this wild trip in search for one thing. In thier trip they go all over europe in search for this one girl and all they know is she lives in berlin geremany. This movie is great for a good laugh.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's The Beatles. It's an undeniable (literally, undeniable) masterpiece. People knows, people say, since the day of it's realease. Jimi Hendrix was plaing one day after it's realease, Brian Wilson went to bed for a few years (not that he needed, being himself a musical genious), the Stones could never done it, neither other rock band (in fact, what other band did it ?), if you can consider rock and roll music as an artistic movement (or, considering today's musical scenarium, artistic whatever), you own that to Sgt. Pepper's. From the front cover till the backwords in the very end of the album, from Chuck Berry to Thom Yorke, it is indispensable. If you love good music, and need a review to buy this album, don't buy it. Try Milly and Vanilly.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|What a shame that this second release in the Matrix trilogy couldn't continue to deliver on the manic and original fun of the first. To be honest, I only watched the first hour, I was so bored by the weird semi-religious nonsense and the tiresome delivery of pompous dialog and the repetitious stunts that I never developed enough interest to see the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Only for the true devotee.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is the CD, that ended it all. (Not counting the Greatest hits, box sets, singles).  This CD was Kurt's last published, and I still think it's amazing.  Although, \\"Nevermind\\" probably is the most listened CD of Nirvana's it just dosent suit me enough as \\"In Utero\\" has.  With a set of Rock, grunge, and just new genre of the 90's.  I think it's stupid how people have decided to say it was Nirvana's fault for starting a new crappy rock of the 90's-00.  They didn't, they created their own thing, He became an idol over the nation, it wasant \\"his\\" fault.  Although Kurt's music isnt under the genre of \\"Punk Rock\\".  I felt the power of Punk rock emotion of their first debut CD \\"Bleach\\".  Im sick of tons of (...) saying \\"Guns and Roses\\", \\"Van Halen\\", whomever can \\"beat\\" Kurt up.  What the hell does beating up a artist prove?  It proves mock of jealousy.  Kurt was an amazing person, In Utero was amazing.  Kurt had a weak soul, stomach pains, but when he was up in stage he was someone new.
0345349571|5.0|Barbara Tuchman does a masterful job of sifting through reams of medieval manuscripts to create this fascinating portrait of 14th century Europe. First, I had no idea that there was still so much original material for a historian to work with. Second, I didn't realize how much could be gleaned from reading  between the lines of these precious documents. Tuchman delves beneath and behind the recorded words to shine a light on the truth of living in that calamitous time. It was a century in which the Black Death and the Hundred Years' War combined to demoralize and radicalize a weakened populace. It was a century in which the pillars of society, both secular and religious, seemed lethally pervaded with corruption and incompetence. It was a time of peasant revolts that prefigured the popular revolutions of the 18th century and a time when the Church's utter lack of spirituality set the stage for the 16th century reformers. Yet it was also a century of crusading heroes and prophetic witnesses, in which national identities were solidifying.<br /><br />Tuchman focuses on a single figure, previously unknown to me, who found himself at many of the critical events of the century. Le Sire de Coucy, thoroughly a man of his time, exemplified the great strengths of his day and (to a lesser extent) its weaknesses. Proud, noble, courageous, discreet and intelligent, Coucy is the epitome of the knight in shining armor, in a time when the virtues of that calling were more sung about than lived. I came away from \\"A Distant Mirror\\" with a great admiration for this previously anonymous \\"chevalier.\\"<br /><br />Tuchman calls the 14th century a mirror of the troubled 20th century. The parallels were less clear to me, and this is the sole weakness of the book. We will have to see whether the calamaties of the 20th century (genocidal world wars, global economic disruptions, decolonialism) will set the stage for a wholesale power shift on the part of present-day society.<br /><br />That said, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a sparkling jewel of the popular historian's art, bringing to life a time and place that are otherwise known only through myth and romance.t said, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a sparkling jewel of the popular historian's art, bringing to life a time and place that are otherwise known only through myth and romance.
B00014X8KO|5.0|I'm still pretty new to this wide new world of anime, so I can't really compare Memories to other works in the genre.  I can say that it is a most interesting and impressive production made up of three very different short films from some of the leading names in anime.  I don't think the visuals are quite as dazzling as that of more recent anime films, but the artistry of these three episodes certainly does help define the very different worlds in which the action takes place and demonstrates the compelling, visceral powers of anime.  We have the celebrated Katsuhiro Otomo to thank for this project; each of the three films, if I'm not mistaken, was adapted from a short manga piece in Otomo's graphic novel Memories.<br /><br />Episode One is Magnetic Rose, directed by Koji Morimoto of Animatrix fame.  This is a beautiful, haunting tale of a most unusual space rescue mission.  The crew of a space garbage collection ship responds to a distress signal from a dead part of space.  Two crew members board the debris-shrouded vessel and enter a completely different world, one fueled by the memories of a beautiful young opera singer who apparently retreated to the isolation of space following a tragedy in her life.  I won't pretend to have understood every thing about this story, but it is wholly captivating.  The men encounter lavish rooms including opera houses and living quarters fit for a princess, holograms and other visual artifacts of \\"the young Madam\\" Eva entertaining guests and audiences, and decayed artifacts that sometimes come to life in front of their eyes.  Each man is soon drawn into the vivid, colorful world of Eva's memories, but only one recognizes the unreality behind the vivid scenes he encounters - in his case, though, memories of his own wife and child serve as fuel for the increasingly realistic episodes he experiences.  Much of the story takes place to a soundtrack of beautiful opera music such as that of Puccini, and the combination of such grand music and the amazing visual miracles that define anime of the highest caliber make this a most powerful film indeed.<br /><br />Episode Two, Stink Bomb from director Tensai Okamura, goes in a completely different direction.  Existing in some nebulous space between dark comedy and grim political satire, Stink Bomb is certainly entertaining but much less powerful than the other two films.  In this story, a young scientific researcher takes an experimental fever pill that turns out to be something else entirely.  He awakes to find everyone in the building comatose or dead (it's never really clear to me), and panicked company executives order him to find the pills and the secret documentation related to them so that he can bring everything to them in Tokyo immediately.  He does just that, but he comes across death and destruction everywhere he goes.  He does not understand that he has become a biological weapon emanating deadly gas from within his own body.  It's almost comical to see the military firepower brought to bear - quite fruitlessly - against him as the military seeks to stop the spread of the noxious gas.  The ending is also somewhat comical, on a dark level.<br /><br />The last and shortest of the films comes from Katsuhiro Otomo himself.  Cannon Fodder is an extremely dark film that vividly portrays a day in the life of a militaristic society along the lines of a post-modern day Prussia (i.e., pointy helmets are big in this world) dedicated solely and completely to the continued firing of gigantic cannons against some nebulous enemy.  The obvious interpretation is one of the insanity of warfare, and the dark tones and grimly drawn characters bring the message home in a powerful fashion.  Interestingly, the entire action seems to consist of one continuous shot that moves fluidly from one scene to another.<br /><br />Memories dates back to 1995, but it is certainly an impressive example of anime's unique strengths and possibilities.  The music, I should mention,plays an integral role in each film, especially Magnetic Rose - I think this DVD is worth owning just for this first amazing film alone.  Otomo, Morimoto, and Okamuro are the same masters of anime who gave the world such wonders as Akira, Animatrix, and Ghost in the Shell, so anime newbies can rest assured that Memories will not disappoint.uld mention, plays an integral role in each film, especially Magnetic Rose - I think this DVD is worth owning just for this first amazing film alone.

B00005JNEI|1.0|While I think Michael Moore is an absolute idiot, and his \\"documentary\\" nothing more than a collection of lies, half- truths and out of context quotations creatively assembled in the editing room, I must applaud and respect the fact that we, as Americans have the right to speak our opinion, however biased and mean spirited they may be. One can only hope that the truly enlightened will see this movie for the waste of film stock and electricity it truly is. Better yet, they will know what to expect from Mr. Moore and not have to put themselves through the ordeal of watching this trash.
B0002F1CO6|3.0|The Universal Migrator double CD set has finally been rereleased containing both the Dreamsequencer and Flight of the Migrator albums. The musical genius Arjen Lucassen decided not to put any bonus tracks on the disc as to be fair to those who have already purchased the albums separately, although the selling price is a lot cheaper (2 for 1). The storyline is that of a Machine called the Migrator that takes the inhabitant through a mind journey of space and time, the first disc seems to me that of exploration, and the second is where the story becomes more intense. It's a little tough to follow because there aren't character roles as in Arjen's latest Album \\"The Human Equation.\\" This time he's got different vocalists like Lana Lane, Russell Allen, Bruce Dickenson amoung others. <br /> <br />The first disc \\"Dreamsequencer\\" is the softer of the 2. There are lots of 70's influenced prog rock elements taken from such bands as the Beatles (late) and Pink Floyd but all basically kept at a very spacey level. While his latest album \\"Human Equation\\" he takes more of a diverse approach including all influences from Prog Metal, Hardcore, Celtic, Folk, 70's Prog Rock, this album is more of an abundance of synthesizer melodies, atmospheres and effects as tied well w/ the futuristic, intergalactic storyline. The music is very atmospheric, and not really about instantly catchy moments but more of stretched out melodies from the use of vocals as well as instrumentals. The opening instrumental isn't all that big a deal but the first real track \\"My House on Mars\\" is an incredible song, w/ it's beautiful futuristic main guitar lead and swapped vocal chorus is a track that'll be repeated over and over. Other great songs are the Beatles influenced \\"The First Man on Earth\\" and female sung \\"Temple of the Cat.\\" There are a few skippers on this one. Now, even though the not so good songs aren't good b/c of their rather slow undiverse choruses, there is still plenty of depth and good momentsw/in them, which is still able to be appreciated. An example would would be \\"Carried by the Wind\\" which even though has a pretty catchy guitar melody, it's repeated too many times giving the song almost no diversity. Also, some songs are just too long for their own good. I'd give the first disc 3 stars. Some fantastic songs worth owning, some skippers, but nothing BAD.  <br /> <br />The second overall better disc \\"..Migrator\\" is the heavier of the two. This one's got a mix of heavy power chord prog metal and spacey atmospheres. After the just OK opening instrumental, \\"Dawn of the Million Souls\\" is a good song as sung by Sir Russell Allen but really only has a good chorus backing it up, which I guess doesnt qualify for a GREAT song. The good songs continue w/ \\"Journey on the waves of time\\" and the best song on both discs \\"To the Quasar,\\" which has got a beautiful pulse rhythmic synth progression along w/ a \\"twilight\\" guitar melody during the verses and a hypnotic chorus which just oozes w/ imaginative inspiration. This is one of the few songs you can let play w/ your imagination.  <br />The next few songs aren't as good but still worthy, such as \\"Through the WormHole\\" and the melodically sung \\"to the solar system.\\" What I didn't like about this disc inparticular was how at some moments Lucassen just seemed to get too carried away w/ the continuous keyboard and guitar runs. the 10+ minute \\"Into the Black HOle\\" is a decent song but not enough to sustain such a length, plus i feel it gets too complex for its own good (as are a few other songs on this album). this disc ends weakly w/ the unmelodic and plain chorus of the final track \\"The New Migrator.\\" I'd give this disc 4 stars, mostly great stuff, some that is really \\"too much\\" but again, nothing BAD.  <br /> <br />The great thing about Arjen's music is that no matter what type of music you're into, there is something to love on his albums, a good amount to love to warrent a purchase. When this guy write a good song,it becomes a beautiful, fantastic song. Sure there may be some skippers on this album (i really like about 11 or 12 of the 20 tracks), and it's not all really a drive in your car type of thing, but more of a lay back and enjoy type music, but overall I still think Arjen's a musical genius, and w/ the $15 price tag for 2 discs, it's definitely a no brainer. Sure it's not as diverse as the latest, but the story line calls for a such a sound, and w/in that particular sound, the album is incredibly diverse. I mostly gave this a 3.5 star review b/c after being completely blown away by \\"The Human Equation\\" I guess I was expecting the same, but 3.5 isn't a bad review, it's good, just w/ some \\"not as good\\" spots.  <br /> <br />

B0002Y4TTC|3.0|After all these years, BG has released their first DVD! Now, I was as excited about this one as anyone else, but though I feel I got my money's worth in terms of extras, I don't feel this DVD really went deep into BG as people or wasn't as diverse in terms of the content.  <br />The first dvd is a live concert they played in Germany during their last tour as part of a festival they had set up, and it's 20 tracks long. Thier playing skills were fine, and some songs stuck out better than others, but they aren't really a \\"showy\\" type band, which means that you're not going to see a whole lot of running around or talking, and on top of that, a lot of times the band just doesn't seem into the music, they're just playing for the sake of finishing a song. The band seems to become more relaxed about halfway into the concert, where the show gets a lot better (I was blown away at their ability to play \\"...And then there was silence\\" the 14 minute diverse as hell track from their latest album,they performed it brilliantly to say the least). But other than the concert, the first disc has nothing else. The picture is very sharp and looks fantastic, but the sound quality was a little rough, although that might have been either the recording, or the band just being somewhat sloppy at playing. they're able to pull off their older thrash metal songs MUCH better than their later songs. Those older tracks are a lot quicker, louder, heavier, and \\"fuller\\" thus really getting the crowd excited, whereas the newer stuff they hardly played any of and when they did there seemed to be more \\"holes\\" w/in the guitar lines taking away from the fast and furious excitment. On top of that, the newer stuff calls for a lot more high pitched elongated vocals, which Hansi cannot pull off live, taking a huge bite out of the excitement.  <br />The second disc has got a pretty long \\"making of\\" section. But it's not the \\"making of\\" any album or anything studio, but actually showing the band setting up for the festival and going into technical jargon on what their roadies are doing (which is pretty uninteresting), although there were a few scenes of BG hanging out w/ fans before the festival, which was fun. One important thing to point out, since this was all filmed in Germany, EVERYTHING, except for the songs themselves is spoken in german, you can set up subtitles but sometimes it isn't enough. There is also a BG interview where they get asked really only a handful a questions which are pretty boring and unneccessary (ex: how do you stay fit? does touring take a tole on your family life? how do you set up before playing?). BG didn't elaborate all that well on answers either, which makes the one part of the DVd where you actually get to know the band pretty much wasted. There is also a boring slideshow which has nothing but far away shots of the concert itself.  <br />the thing that bothered me the most was the german speak. During the \\"making of\\" section, BG basically narrated what they filmed and a lot of times there would be scenes w/ them hanging out together but the subtitles wouldn't show up so you heard them making jokes and stuff but unless you speak german, you have no idea what the hell was going on. There is lastly a few bonus live songs (4 of them) taken from 2 other concerts which were pretty cool and I enjoyed.  <br />So though this is cool to watch maybe a couple of times (the first DVD really) I was upset at the diversity of the disc. In Opeth's \\"Lamentations\\" DVd you at least got to konw the band a little better by going into the studio and having depthful questions being asked and interviewing the members individually. This BG dvd is all about the festival though, and though it was a good show, I simply cannot see the replay value of this, even though there are a handful of good moments. Plus, the $22+ sale price is a bit too much for what you get in return. Not bad, but not great either, just pretty good. For hardcore BG fans only.
0385336810|5.0|I got this book the day it came out and I could not put it down. Sophie Kinsella is a great writer and she makes me addicted to her books. Emma is a great character and I really felt for her. I heard that they are making this into a movie with Kate Hudson and they better not mess it up because I loved it. I recommend this book to people who like chick-lit books.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I understand how some viewers may interpret Sofia Coppola's film, \\"Lost in Translation\\" as a meaningless collection of sights and sounds with a couple of underdeveloped characters.  <br /> <br />Now I don't agree with this, but I am not going to tell them they are wrong, just encourage them to look beyond the perhaps  mundane plot of this work and reflect on how it so truthfully represents the actual experiences of everyday life.  <br /> <br />Life's mundane, not everyday is exciting and that Sofia Coppola wasn't afraid to express that idea interested me.  That's what touched me, how real it was.   <br /> <br />Now granted we all don't go to Tokyo everyday, etc. but there is so much truth in the way the characters interacted with the world around them.  They didn't need to be completely explained, we didn't need to know their entire background or how they spent every moment of their day, they are just understood and recognised as true people searching for their place in this crazy world.  <br /> <br />In recognising that idea, I was able to feel a realistic connection to these lost souls, much more so than the characters in a typical melodrama or action adventure.   <br /> <br />So, if you can appreciate the idiosyncrasies of life and the humor within all that is around you, you will probably enjoy this unique glimpse into these character's lives. <br />
B00000FZ1V|4.0|The beauty of this film is that it's sole reason for existing is just to make you laugh.  It's utter lack of pretense is downright refreshing. When this film was released in 1984 it must have hit some kind of nerve with the public who were in need for a good laugh because it raked in a domestic gross in excess of $200,000,000, an unheard of sum for a comedy at that time.  Basically, this film is a throwback to the films of Abbott and Costello or the Bowery Boys where they find themselves in some supernatural setting and comic hijinks ensue.  What differentiates these films is that \\"Ghostbusters\\" has the droll comic prescence of Bill Murray to comment on the proceedings and state-of-the-art special effects.  Though \\"Ghostbusters\\" is an ensemble effort(and a good one at that)this is essentially Murray's show.  This is not to diminish the fine work contributed here by Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Sigourney Weaver, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton but they are overshadowed here by Murray's prescence.  Enough cannot be said about the special effects here, that are both dazzling and funny.  The reason I point this out is that the special effects technicians on this film lost the Academy award to what I feel was the lesser effects of \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\".  My feeling about special effects are you can have the most impressive light show in the world but if they don't service the story, so what.
B00028HBKM|4.0|I will be honest, I am not the most religious person out there. I decided anyways to watch this movie in the theatre. The story line is very similiar to that in the bible but when i read this in the bible, i felt this was a harsh punishment and did not think too much of it. After watching this, one can get a better appreciation for Jesus. I was speechless half way through and I just tried to take in as much as I can. This was a horrendous act and by watching The Passion of the Christ, this changed my views on my religious background. I insist on everyone seeing this movie even if you are from a different religion.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|When \\"Animal House\\" came out in 1978 it ushered in a new genre, the slob vs. snob film.  It also bought to the silver screen a prescence that unfortunately burned brightly and then burned out all too soon.  John Belushi was such a massive comic force that you laughed hysterically at the turn of one of his eyebrows.  The film is graced with an excellent young cast (Tim Mattheson, Peter Riegert, Karen Allen, Tom Hulce, Stephen Furst) but it's Belushi that elevates this film to comic nirvana.  The humor holds up remarkably well today, rather, some of it seems a little innocent in light of what the Farrelly brothers and the \\"American Pie\\" creators have brought to the screen.  Enjoy the innocent fratboy humor of this film and take it for what it is.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is filled with classic after classic. There is just a ton of stuff on here, and they are more than just 1:30 minutes long (at least most of them). But I just want to say that I like this album because of the music on it, not because DUR IT HAS 30 SONGS ON IT, DUEERRRRRR!!! The reason why I'm writing this down is because someone wrote a review on how the Beatles are better than Led Zeppelin (kind of funny they are not even the same type of music) just because the White Album had 30 songs on it and the fourth Led Zeppelin album had only 8. Here's a list of some of the greatest albums in history that have 10 or less tracks: <br />1.All of Black Sabbath's early 70's material (except for best of) <br />2.All of Van Halen's albums before 5150 <br />3.All of Metallica's albums before the Black Album (funny how this product is called the White Album!) <br />4.I could list a ton of great albums here but at least every major rock act has released a 10 or less song album and it kicked. <br /> <br />Besides the numbers arguement this is a really great album. In fact, the 30 songs on this album makes me wish it had 300! You can make great music with only 8 songs but in the end the huge albums that are great are better because you get alot more great content on one album. I'm a f-f-f-f-ootball playurrrr!
6305922756|5.0|This ranks as one of the great satires ever committed to film and one of the funniest comedies ever.  What distinguishes this film from other satires is that it knows it's subject matter in and out and despite the inherent humor of the heavy metal music genre it has affection for it's main characters.  There is so much good stuff here that to give away the surprises would be criminal.  Kudos to Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer for such an ingenious collaboration.  The numerous cameos here (Ed Begley Jr., Billy Crystal, Angelica Huston,etc.) are also a joy to behold.  Tony Hendra as Ian Faith, the cricket-bat wielding manager of the band and June Chadwick as McKean's girlfriend-astrologer also make a major contribution to the film.  Even Rob Reiner as director Marty DiBergi( a sly reference to Martin Scorsese and his rock film, \\"The Last Waltz\\") adds something to the film.  This was Rob Reiner's directing debut and despite numerous successes(\\"Stand by Me\\", \\"When Harry Met Sally\\",\\"A Few Good Men\\") he never, in my mind, attained the heights that he reached with this initial effort.  I think the collaboration with Guest(who had subsequent success to a lesser degree with this \\"mockumentary\\" format), McKean, and Shearer just brought out the best in everybody.  As far as the DVD package, there's a great running commentary from \\"the band\\" as well as some interesting faux rock videos.
B000002J09|5.0|OOOHHH I LISTEN LED ZEPPELIN, UUURRR! THAT MUST MAKE ME STTTTOOOPPIDD, URRRRRHHH!!! All joking aside, what is so bad about Led Zeppelin guys? Just because they are one of the most overated bands in existence doesn't mean they suck. Here's how I look at it: <br /> <br />1.Robert Plant: His vocals are not legendary, BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY NOT CRAP!!! He should get credit for being one of the few British frontmen who can get away with sounding like a moaning woman. <br />2.Jimi Paige: He is not: OH MY GOD JIMI PAIGE IS A GOD, HE IS THE GREATEST EVER! However: JIMI PAIGE IS NOT A SCRATCHY BLUES GUITARIST METALGOD!!! The man is a great guitarist and at least belongs in the top 20 guitarists. <br />3.John Paul Jones: Everyone always says: oh my goodness that bass playuueer from Led Zeppelin is the greatest! Here's what I ask: How can he be so great if you don't even know who he is? His name is John Paul Jones and even though he is not the greatest, he definitely left his mark. <br />4.Jon Bonman: Anybody who hates the living crap out of Led Zeppelin will say that this guy was the only good member out of all of them. Other people would say that he is the greatest ever. I disagree with both statements because he is a great drummer but he is only overated because he died. <br /> <br />So overall, not a bad crew, but they do get praised like they are the greatest invention since light. I notice that anyone who hates Led Zeppelin usually makes comments on this product and most of the people who hold Led Zeppelin superior to all things and have the guts to insult Black Sabbath make their comments here. First of all, the review is on the fourth Led Zeppelin album not the band Led Zeppelin. If you want to make a hateful comment, make it about how you hate the fourth Led Zeppelin album and not how you hate Led Zeppelin just because they are overated banklaughers. Secondly, dude what is up with die-hard Led Zeppelin fans insulting Black Sabbath?! It not only happens here, it happens on the Black Sabbath product reviews! Why do Led Zeppelin fans hate the Sabbath?! Let me give you a piece of advice, before you insult a product actually listen to the whole thing before making biased comments! You can keep the biased comments on your product review, but before you make a negative Sabbath review it better include a real reason besides:'Led Zeppelin is better!' If you make biased reviews that are negative on another product without actually listening to it, you are falsely turning someone away from a product they might be interested in! Anyone noticed how Stone Cold's review has been removed? That is because he did nothing but bash the McPrueter kid to death with negative reviews! But the damage doesn't just stop there, this guy named metalgod wrote a negative review about the fourth Led Zeppelin album, and then Stone Cold goes on about how crappy Ozzy-era Sabbath was! I personally don't blame whoever got rid of his review. <br /> <br />Now, here is the real review for the fourth Led Zeppelin Album. You maybe wondering, why is he calling it the fourth Led Zeppelin Album and not just Led Zeppelin IV or ZOSO. First of all, whoever came up with ZOSO is on crack. Second of all, some guy got all granged up at the fact that people were giving it a name, so this is so he doesn't get constipated when he reads this. You maybe wondering, why is he giving it four stars if he has been calling this album overated the whole time and the band overated? But here's how I look at it: <br />5-stars: <br />1.Overated band <br />2.Overated album <br />3.But the music is still great so just shut up! <br />Here is the reason why its 4 stars: <br />1.Do you really need to hear Stairway to Heaven for the 1,988,376,074,992nd time!?
B0000DJZA5|5.0|before i bought this album, i was just a casual fan of the beatles <br /> <br />they had some good songs, i liked them, but i never went out of my way for it <br /> <br />first off, i always loved the song \\"let it be\\" and when i heard they were rereleasing the album, i wanted it <br /> <br />my local oldies station played the CD one night, and i had troubles staying awake to listen to it, but i am INCREDIBLY glad i did <br /> <br />i got this as a christmas present from my ex-g/f, and since then, i want more and more beatles <br /> <br />about this CD though, i thought it all sounded amazing, every song was perfect, especially \\"the long and winding road\\" because paul no longer sounds sick and whiny <br /> <br />and \\"let it be\\" oh man, what can't i say?! this song freakin rocks!! <br /> <br />i like this version of \\"across the universe\\" better, it's not as rushed and it's just a beautiful song <br /> <br />overall, this is an amazing album and it brings the beatles back to their rock and roll roots, which i like the most <br /> <br />BUY THIS CD IF YOU LOVE THE BEATLES
0425152251|4.0|This book attempts to do an overview of philosophy suitable for teenagers or older, with an intertwined story to keep the material from getting too dry. It's a great idea, and succeeds to some degree (since it kept me reading until the end), but has its problems: <br /> <br />- The fictional characters in it are for the most part are unconvincing cardboard cutouts that trot around agreeing with and sounding like the author, and the story they're involved in is kind of dull for the first few hundred pages. <br /> <br />- Part of the message toward the end of the book is that we're now living in a global society, but the philosophy is almost entirely the standard European fare, with only a couple limited references to Buddhism giving it a wider scope. A big point is made about how tragic it is to not be aware of the last 3000 years of (Western) philosophy, but apparently it's not so tragic to be unaware of the last 3000 years of non-European philosophy. <br /> <br />- The book purports to value sexual equality. But the mothers depicted in the book are vapid and dismissed almost contemptuously, and the bulk of the book consists of wise old learned males pontificating to the young female protagonists. And the young female protagonists are often reduced to short exclamations about how amazing the things the wise old learned males are saying, or otherwise generally agreeing with the opinions of the author. <br /> <br />- There's much complaining about philosophy not being taught in schools, which sounds like a reasonable gripe. But also much whining about how nothing truly important is being taught in schools, which is odd considering the young female protagonists wouldn't be able to read any of their philosophy course that goes on throughout the book without having attended school. Reminds me of a dumb but successful businessman who claimed everything important he learned in school was on the football field.  <br /> <br />- The young philosophers are often admonished tonever leap to conclusions, but the author does so all the time. He seems to be someone who is interested in philosophy, but not very good at doing philosophy, so the book weakens as he drifts off from communicating what previous philosophers have said and starts saying his own stuff. <br /> <br />All in all, I would recommend it as a quick overview of pre-modern Western philosophy, useful for getting the reader sufficiently oriented to do further reading on specific subjects.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a brilliant film.  What is most damning is not any political slant that Moore may be projecting, but the video footage of George W. Bush.  Nothing Moore could say could make him appear any more incompetent and foolish than he already is.  I also loved the numerous clips where Bush, Cheney, Rice, Powell and Rumsfeld all link Iraq to 911 and Al Quaida.  Juxtapose that with Cheney's whopping lie during the VP debate where he denied linking the two.   <br /> <br />The connect the dots with the Saudi's and Bin Laden family was fun.  But the film has a lot of poignant moments as well, including the military mom that lost her son in Iraq.  Perhaps the scariest moment of the film wasn't the sound and footage of the terrorist attack of 911 or Karl Rove putting spit into his hair (yuk!), but Bush sitting there for 7 minutes continuing with his photo op after being told the country was under attack.  Most people would have politely excused themselves and looked into what was going on.  AWOL again.  The man who is sworn to protect us and this is how he handles a crisis? <br /> <br />Very revealing film, a must see for every American. <br />
B00006L9ZT|4.0|This has all the makings of a classic but ultimately it falls short; unlike a ring it is not perfik. <br /> <br />Firstly, I would like to say that I am delighted to be able to see a proper traditional staging of the Ring of the Nibelung instead of the usual half-baked, unintelligent modern productions I am treated to at my local opera house. Who wants to see Wotan as a mob leader and the Rhinemaidens as lap dancers!?! In what sense do such interpretations conform to Wagner's ideology that his operas, layden in symbolism as they are, portray worlds that exist outside space and time and hence outside any historical period. To impose a contemporary setting on a Wagner opera is to show a complete lack of understanding as to how these operas can be produced. <br />Anyway, it certainly makes a difference having such a traditional renditon of 'der Ring des Nibelungen' and there is no doubt that there are moments in this opera when I do feel drawn 'outside space and time'. <br /> <br />Now for some gripes. <br />I have perused many of the reviews of this DVD box set and I am in agreement that there have been some miscastings. I suppose over four operas it is almost inevitable that one or other of the lead performers is not going to be ideal or is not going to be to everyone's liking and I am willing to accept that the challenge of Wagner's staging and acting/singing requirements are unlikely to be ever completly met to my liking. Nevertheless, I feel that above all Siegfried Jerusalem, whilst excellent as Loge in 'das Rheingold', doesn't convince as his namesake in operas 3 and 4. Firstly, he is about twenty years too old which really does detract from credibility. Secondly, his acting is overly hammy; i know that Siegfried is something of a caricature but I think such an enthusiastic and grinning performance would be more commensurate with a tenor in his early twenties. Jerusalem also lacks the stature of a Siegfried-esque hero. He needs to be more upright and arrogant, in sum more gravitas needed.  <br />I think Hildegard Behrens is another who doesn't quite fit the bill. The basic problem is that she seems too feeble to be Brunnhilde. She lacks power in her presence and also in her voice and is also devoid of a nymphish arrogance so important to the lead Valkyrie. In her defence I would say that her essence of vulnerability contrasts well with the authorative performance of James Morris as Wotan particularly in the culminating scene of Act 3 of 'die Walkure' which is excellent. <br />These are the most essential problems. <br />Other lesser gripes include: <br />Lack of stage action during 'ride of the Valkyries' to synchronise with the power of the music. <br />Dodgy acting by Gary Lakes as Siegmund in 'die Walkure' - his eyes are all over the place presumably looking at the conductor, which is very distracting. <br />Obvious lack of physical resemblance between Siegmund and Sieglinde. <br /> <br />Gripes aside I think there are many positives about this production.  <br />The performances by those playing the parts of Wotan (as mentioned), Alberich, Mime, Sieglinde, Gunther, Hagen, Erda and the Rhinemaidens are all very good I thought, in terms of both singing and acting which are frankly of equal importance. The staging is generally top notch with a particularly spectacular finale in Gotterdamerung and a beautifully ethereal Valhalla, not to mention a well used apparent holographic effect on Erda and the Norns.  <br />I disagree with a popular opinion amongst reviewers here that there is a lack of movement and energy on the set. I don't think serious Wagner operas generally require a lot of running around and pointless animation but when it was required there were good dynamics e.g. the relationship between Siegfried and Mime, Loge's character. I don't really want to see Wotan running around in circles after Brunnhilde or Fricke frankly. I also thought Levine did a good job of conducting and I much preferred his interpretationof the pivotal 'Siegfried's funeral march' to the typically brass drowned Solti version.  <br /> <br />So all in all, this is certainly a worthwhile purchase and for serious Wagner fans to be preferred over any pretentious and paradoxically trivial modern staged version. With the exception of some cast changes I think this version is about as good a version of 'the Ring' as you're going to get though I think an animated version would be a very interesting idea as mentioned by another reviewer here. <br />Ultimately, no one version of the Ring is going to be to everyone's liking. Nothing is perfik, not even my spelling.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This is a must-have item for anyone who loves watching Gene Kelly as I do.  SINGIN' IN THE RAIN was the high point of his career and also put Debby Reynolds, Donald O'Connor and Cyd Charisse on the map to be noticed for more important roles in the future.<br /><br />The quintessential musical, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN seamlessly moves from story to musical numbers, from humor to romance, and shows the brilliance of Gene Kelly and others in the \\"Freed Unit,\\" the name affectionately given to those who worked closely with producer Arthur Freed--the only producer who was given free reign at MGM by Louis B. Mayer during that magical time.<br /><br />If for no other reason, this movie gives you a chance to see Gene Kelly's SINGIN' IN THE RAIN number on a sprinklered, tarp-covered backlot street.  Although technically not his best or most spectacular, it is certainly his most memorable for the sheer exhuberance he shows over being in love.  You can't watch it and not smile.  As Leonard Bernstein said when he first saw the number, \\"That is an affirmation of life.\\"  Truer words were never spoken and, even today, that number and the rest of the movie feel as fresh and enjoyable as they were 50 years ago.<br /><br />Regarding the 50th anniversary edition--there are many special features worth having, the best being the documentary on Disc 2 called WHAT A GLORIOUS FEELING, a documentary on the making of this fantastic movie.  Other features include a documentary on Arthur Freed and his many contributions to songs and musical pictures over the years, as well as older footage showing the original film debuts of the songs from SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, all of which were written and showcased in the 1930's, with the exception of Donald O'Connor's showstopping number MAKE 'EM LAUGH.<br /><br />SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a classic among classics.  It is a culmination of Gene Kelly's choreography and performance, Donald O'Connor's comedic skills, Debby Reynolds' charm and innocence, Stanley Donen's directorial skills, Arthur Freed's production abilities, and Comden and Green's collaborative genius that will stand the test of time.

0393035158|1.0|Religion is not just about believing in God. Religion was started to create order and have a set of laws to help the world. You can't just get rid of religion with more science. People hope and pray for good things around the world and to blame the idea of religion for a few people reading the holy books the wrong way is no way to justify that religion is not needed. Reason can come with religion. People don't have to choose reason over religion, but accept both. Looking at other religions such as Buddhism, it shows an acceptable society that lives with religion and reason. If God exists or not isn't what religion only talks about. They teach moral guidelines to live by and they make you understand how to live a good life, for example, to steal something is wrong and morally you should understand why you should not steal; while if we got rid of religion we wouldn't steal because it is illegal and punishment will follow the crime. Also most of the world lives well with religion in their lives it's only the few acts of violence we hear about in the news that shows misguided people viewing their religion from a wrong stance.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is again out there fighting for middle america.  My wife and I saw F9/11 at a local theater, and were pleased that we were turned away on the 5th night because it was still sold out.  We walked away elated, not frustrated.  When we finally saw the movie, it was very hard-hitting.  Information that was gathered from newsreel and public documents.  It's all there.  Moore uses a little bit of his schtick in D.C. trying toget Congressional offspring to sign up for Iraq, but all in all, he showed that the president and family are not forthcoming in most aspects of their lives.  The coverup of Halliburton and Saudi connections is very real and available.   <br /> <br />Hey! All of you naysayers, even if it's 90% or 80% true, which factcheckers were utilized to make SURE that it was not faulty information, then it's STILL a SCARY REALITY that our President could be sickenly outside of the public interest.
0385335482|3.0|Kinsella writes beautifully. Her book is a quick and easy read. My complaints are a result of staying up into the wee hours of the night to read this book with the thought that she was going to get into some real drama and fantastic fun. To my disappointment, there wasn't any. I kept reading with hopes that something marvelously profound was going to happen and in the end, it all just seemed to be a love story that had a happy ending. However, if this is your kind of thing than by all means read this book. But beware...from one true shopalholic to another...it's a disgrace that she calls herself a shopalholic at all.
B000059XUI|4.0|I first saw this in the theater for in 1981, I recall the audience as a whole actually giving a joyful shout when a graphic at the end of the movie proclaimed Superman would be back soon in a sequel to Superman II.  This is not just the faulty  remembrance of a child since I was 24 years old when I saw this movie.    Reeve subtlety balanced the strength of Superman with the mild-mannered nature of Clark Kent wonderfully.  I was never too fond of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane, but to be fair she played a driven reporter well, so my lack of fondness is superficially driven by me not understanding her physical appeal to another.  Gene Hackman played the evil sociopath Lex Luthor with a joyful exuberance.      Those who are overly critical of this film may forget that special effects in 1981 were not up to today's standard.  Of course, dialogue in today's movies are rarely up to older film's standards since conversation was more important then in a time before today's brief e-mail mentality where communications disappear with a keystroke into a spiral of  computer generated special effects explosions.      Older movies were often journeys.  Today's special effects driven movies are roller coasters, taking you nowhere and leaving you exactly where you started when the ride is over.  In Superman II, your imagination had to fill in some of the holes, but I never witness today's audiences applauding something in the movie proclaiming the movie hero will be back.  That is the standard by which this film should be judged.
B000002MP2|5.0|<br />Nowadays, punk is way too commercial. After listening to all these guys talk about cars and cash and all that crap, it feels good to pop in a Green Day CD and listen to some good, old-fashioned punk. These guys have stayed true to the music since their '92 debut and they're still running strong, even with their seventh album \\"American Idiot\\", which is also a great classic. These guys defined what punk should be, with their blunt lyrics and unwillingness to change. My new goal is to buy all the Green Day CDs and have a great collection of punk. I recommend you buy this too. Best song is \\"Pulling Teeth\\".
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Awe-inspiring, thrilling, interesting film about the developement of the railroads in the west, and three men entangled in the affairs of one woman. Of all of Leone's great great westerns, this is the \\"other one.\\" In scope, quality, story and effect it only stands with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. I highly recommend it, and like it even more than The Good, The Bad....Henry Fonda is a badass here, Charles Bronson, still cool and quiet, Jason Robards gruff and funny and Claudia Cardinale very sexy and grounded.
0140277447|5.0|Honestly, I didn't have the stomach to finish the book. This book can be enlightening to those who are psychologically unattached to the subject but to a resident of South East Asia, this book is liable to stir up hatred against the Japanese.  <br /> <br />On the book itself, I wish though that the book concentrated more on why the massacre occurred. As in one review I read about this book, the explanations on why the massacre took place are inadequate if not inaccurate. To me, analyzing the cause of this massacre is much more valuable than the gory details of rape and mayhem described in the book. One unfortunate incident detailed in the book was that of a young girl strapped publicly to be raped by any passing Japanese soldier. It was said that her sexual organ became so infected that it emitted a foul odor... How would you feel after reading such?  <br /> <br />More importantly though, by the way the Japanese government is handling this issue, we know that a nation can protect its war criminals and that atrocities can go unpunished. This is a message to other nations that you can commit atrocities as long as you have the \\"right political moves\\".  <br /> <br />The truth is that in the future, we can expect the Rape of Nanking to be repeated. What nation? We don't know. When? It's just a matter of time. <br />
B00030590I|5.0|I saw Hero in theaters and I will most definitely purchase this excellent movie on DVD in the near future.  <br /> <br />I noticed many reviews did not enjoy the acrobatic maneuvers in the combat scenes, but I found them to be completely tasteful and incredibly beautiful. The combat stunts using ropes and such are pulled off seamlessly and done very well leaving it on par with movies like The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The fight scenes themselves are just so artistically orchestrated that you will be left in awe with unblinking eyes. <br /> <br />The storyline is rich and involved, due to the multiple perspectives that make up the bulk of the story. There are many twists and turns making the movie not as simplistic as one might originally think at first glance. I found the story and interaction between characters to be compelling and heartfelt.

B00005JNEI|3.0|Jeeze ... this film has become such a lightening-rod, I'd like to be as careful as I can in my review to leave my own political opinions out of it. <br /> <br />There were certain things I wanted to see when I sat down to watch the film.  I've always felt that in a documentary, structure and integrity are absolutely critical to the success of the piece.  That may sound fairly obvious, but Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' took a LOT of liberties with a TON of the facts it was using to build it's argument as well as jumping all over the place, subject wise (Tim McVey/NRA/Lockheed Martin/the media/K-Mart ... dammit Mike ... pick one and stick with it).  I wanted to see it demonstrated that Moore was past that and trusted his facts enough to present his argument. <br /> <br />So how did he do?  Well ... it's better then 'Columbine.' I still think Moore hit his high-water mark with 'Roger and Me,' but it IS better then the irresponsible 'Columbine.' For the most part, it passed the smell test.  On Moore's web-site he made sure to present the sources he used for his information so the audience could see where he was drawing his conclusions from.   <br /> <br />Granted, several facts have since been de-bunked by the 9-11 commission, but GENERALLY speaking he's much more accurate here then 'Columbine' was in its best moment.  The habit that Moore seems to have developed that drives me crazy though, is that he's too prone to (not always, but sometimes) build a particular argument on HIS INTERPRETATION OF facts, instead of the facts themselves.  This occasionally leads Moore to start getting really carried away with a few of his conspiracy theories (... a pipeline though the middle-east?). <br /> <br />The thing that Moore really has a knack for, is capturing the ridiculous side of human nature and being able to make people laugh at themselves during the worst of times.  I'm thinking of the segments with the \\"office parachute\\" or the sealed \\"anti-terrorist pot-a-john.\\"  There's not enough though, I would have loved it if there was a little more of this kind of humor. <br /> <br />Moore still jumps subjects a little too much.  I'd love for him to just sit down and make a film on JUST the 2000 election or JUST FOX New's right-wing bias or JUST the way fear is used in today's society.  As it is in Fahrenheit, Moore tries to cover every subject and as a result, some interesting work winds up feeling half-finished. <br /> <br />As a whole, if you take this as an Op/Ed piece, it instantly becomes a lot better.  For Bush supporters, you have to realize that this piece is NOT the least bit \\"fair or balanced\\" as Fox News would say.  For the Left, you also need to remember that Moore HAS an agenda and he's been proven in the past to be a little loose with the truth to make his point.  Just because it's such an open-handed slap at Bush, doesn't mean that it's good.  Don't be afraid to challenge Moore and to research his facts on you own.  What you may learn will only strengthen your own convictions. <br /> <br />There in lies the value in a piece such as this.  It will incite people who may not normally follow the political process to get involved and educate themselves.  The challenge for either side is to not just take it at face-value. <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first heard this cd driving in someone else's car and i heard 'paranoid android.'It has got to be one of their best songs. I eventualy bought it and realized that every song rocks. Every song's a winner. Seriously. Top ten albums ever. Period. Because of this i got every radiohead album. they rock. if you dont have any of their albums yet, then get this or hail to the thief. Then get the others if you like. This is a MUST buy. there's a huge booklet inside w/ all the lyrics too. radiohead is one of the top ten greatest bands ever... if you haven't discovered them yet then now is the time.
B00028HBKM|1.0|It bored me so much that I couldn't even watch the whole thing, and I can handle some pretty boring stuff. Not much more to say about it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Quality: The picture in all 3 films is absolutely superb!! (especially apparent when you look at before and after photos)  The sound is also top notch...though I've heard people talk of a few inconsistancies (though I didn't hear them myself).  The box art on the outer case and the individual cases is awesome!  They go perfectly with the already existing prequel dvd cases.<br />The Changes:  Personally I think that the Special edition is better than the original.  George Lucas improved on a lot of things (and also left a lot of things that still needed improvement for that matter)<BR>For the DVD release, he has improved a great many things.  Many of the smaller changes people don't even realize.  <br />For those of you that are too stubborn to realize this, I will explain why you see a YOUNG Anakin Skywalker at the end of Return of the Jedi and not an older Anakin.  When Anakin became Darth Vader, the good that was in Anakin ceased to exist.  When they become one with the Force they take their true (good) form.  In Anakin's case, it was when he was still young.  George Lucas explains this himself in the Commentary if you're willing enough to listen...instead of just turn your head in disgust without putting any thought into the matter whatsoever.<br />Overall, this is an EXCELLENT trilogy of superb quality.  2 Thumbs Up and 5 Stars.
B0006213WG|5.0|Ever since their 1st major record was released I have listened to Sum 41 and really never thought much about them cept that they were a gimicky canadien punk band. Chuck on the other hand was about the best CD I have bought in a long time. A great step toward making good music. :thumbs up:
1401301010|3.0|First off, I am a longtime RHCP fan.  I've been to 7 shows over the years, and I love the band and their music.  I was incredibly excited to read this book, but the finished product wound up being a bit lacking. <br /> <br />THE GOOD:  The book is definitely a great read, and it is hard to put down.  In fact, I finished it in one night!  Kiedis provides a very honest view of his childhood and his life-long struggles with drugs and women.  He comes across as being somewhat self-absorbed and prone to addiction.  Surprisingly, the book seems to suggest that Kiedis will never truly be free of his heroin addiction, as he has slipped many, many times over the years.  Neither his best friend's overdose death nor his visit to the Dalai Lama prevented him from using again, so there is really no reason to believe that he will stay clean now.  This is not a negative comment--rather, I think that Kiedis's honesty allows the reader to draw these less-than-positive conclusions.  Kiedis does not pretend to be something he isn't, and that should be commended. <br /> <br />Kiedis also gives exceptionally detailed accounts of every girlfriend he has ever had--unfortunately, they all blur together.  Each one just seems like a co-dependent for his drug use, with no real identifying personality.  Towards the end of the book, I could have used about 50 pages less about his most recent girlfriend, and about 50 pages more about his music.  This leads to...  <br /> <br />THE BAD:  There is not nearly enough info on the band!  Obviously this is Kiedis's autobiography, but he spends barely any time discussing his lyrics, his performances, his creative process, etc...  Instead, we get chapter after chapter about girlfriends and drug abuses.  These chapters are interesting, but they really needed to be balanced with more info about his music.  We get almost no information about the writing/recording of \\"Californication\\" or \\"By the Way\\", as if Kiedis feels that these albums are inconsequential.He only mentions his bandmates in relation to various confrontations about his or their drug abuse.   <br /> <br />In a similar vein, Kiedis never mentions his film appearances.  It is like his artistic life was off-limits for this book, while only his sordid sex & drug stories were deemed worthy for publication! <br /> <br />Overall, I do not know whether or not to recommend the book.  I don't want to give it a bad rating, because it is a good read and many people will find Kiedis's life an extraordinary tale.  However, the book could have been much, much better. <br /> <br />
0345350499|5.0|This book shows another way of viewing the myths of King Arthur that we all know and love. Not only does it spin the old myth on it's ear in the religious sense, but it does so in a social sense (as far as the relationships between men and women go) as well. It is wonderfully intricate and full of fantasy, romance and intrigue. I highly recommend this book to anyone! Don't let it's enormous page-count scare you off! I read this book about once a year and every time I do, I get something different out of it. The Mists of Avalon touched me very deeply and continues to do so on a surprising regular basis. This is a MUST read!    I do highly recommend that you purchase the hard-cover edition, as the paperback version seems to fall apart pretty quickly.    It is also important to note that there is not a sequel to this book which is anywhere near as well-written or profound. Read The Mists of Avalon, but do not bother with any of the sequels.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Oh, the plot is good. Paltrow, is great and  Judy Dench is great. Even Ben Affleck is great - he's cast as an egocentric twit, so he brings all the right skills to the role.<br /><br />What I really like is all the little side-comments, somtimes when Will hears an odd phrase as he passes through the marketplace. They are the phrases that eventually  build up into his scripts. To see this movie, you'd think that all his finest lines were stolen. Well, so be it. The finest craftsman takes the greatest pride in the quality of the material that he steals.<br /><br />The 'confession' is wonderful, a workable analogy to modern psycotherapy. Dench is wonderful as Elizabeth, esp. in the final ten minutes or so. The nurse/maid (Imelda Staunton) is a quiet favorite - she serves her lady well, even when she might prefer not to.<br /><br />Paltrow is lovely and catches the cadence of Elizabethan language well, even in the hottest scenes of played passion. There are a few moments, however, when it really looks as of Paltrow has implants and that they are squeezed badly out of shape by the flat-fronted costumes. I prefer the natural figures, even if there's less of them.<br /><br />The movie, as a whole works. But why? \\"It's a mystery.\\"<br /><br />//wiredweird

B00004XPPB|5.0|After reading Joseph Pistone's wonderful book Donnie Brasco I couldn't wait to see this movie. Although this movie is based on Pistone's book, many scenes are fiction. The main difference between the book & the movie is that it WAS NOT Lefty Ruggiero that Pistone became so close to, it was Sonny Black. That's okay, though, this movie is very entertaining & features an outstanding cast: Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Anne Heche (who gets FAR too little screen time but is terrific nevertheless), & especially Michael Madsen, who's one of my favorite actors. The acting is great, the script is believable, & the music is fabulous. Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances & Al Pacino is awesome as usual. The special edition dvd has two brief but informative documentaries as well as deleted scenes, director's commentary, photo gallery, & trailers. For those that enjoy mafia movies this is an absolute must-have.

B00009L1UP|5.0|Everyone knows that this album was released in 1990, right after their successful and amazing \\"Operation Mindcrime.\\" It seems weird to me, though, when people say that this was Queensryche selling out, just because the album sold high. If you look at it closely, you realize that this album should not have sold at all because it is criticizing the same generation that made this album so successful commercially. Here we go: <br />1. Best I Can 10/10- Great opener which shows a Queen influence, even if it's a small one. A heavy, adrenaline-pumping rocker has great performances by Tate and DeGarmo. The highlight of the song is the line \\"AND I WON'T LET GO!\\" <br />2. The Thin Line 6/10- Their most commercial sounding song is pretty good, but does not live up to the previous song. <br />3. Jet City Woman 9/10- One of the many songs on the album that received significant airplay, this is more of a straightforward rocker with not as much of a progressive song structure. <br />4. Della Brown 5/10- A much slower, blues influenced song. Is too monotonous and drags on too long to be enjoyable. <br />5. Another Rainy Night 10/10- As close as Queensryche gets to a ballad on the entire album, still they do not abandon their heavy edge. A very good song that received a ton of airplay, Tate gives a great performance on vocals. <br />6. Empire 10/10- A true masterpiece which criticizes many of the people who bought this album. Starts out with an airhead leaving a message that goes \\"sorry.... It just sort of hit me, like a...two ton...heavy thing.\\" Hahaha. At first seems dated because it has statistics from 1986, but many of the percentages used are similar still today. Chris DeGarmo is amazing on guitar and delivers a great solo. <br />7. Resistance 9/10- A really good song that just does not have the emotional impact that the previous \\"Empire\\" had, still has a good guitar solo. <br />8. Silent Lucidity 6/10- It seems strange that this was such a big hit, incorporates an orchestra, but is really slow. Still, it is a good song, especially since it stays away from the sexism that was synonymous with ballads of the day. <br />9. Hand on Heart 10/10- Another masterpiece with a chorus that only Scrooge himself could hate. A very touching song that is in NO WAY sappy or phony. Throughout the song there are great performances by the entire band, but especially Tate and DeGarmo. <br />10. One on One 6/10- Nothing really wrong with it, just doesn't do anything for me. <br />11. Anybody Listening 10/10- Possibly one of the greatest songs ever written. One problem that I have with it is that in songs like this, it is supposed to build up and up and then about  of the way through, have a guitar solo that builds up and up for the climax. This song has the solo at about half way through and the solo is more like a mountain: it builds up and up, but half way through, works its way back down again. Those are small complaints compared to rest of the song, which is incredible. Great lyrics, vocals, and a still even more outstanding solo by DeGarmo make this Queensryche's best song ever. I just wish that they had shaved a minute off of the end because it serves no purpose whatsoever, it's just the sound of wind blowing. <br />12. Last Time in Paris 6/10- Many fans searched long and hard to find this before it was released as a bonus track. I never really cared for it because by the end of the song, there is nothing memorable about it. <br />13. Scarborough Fair 9/10- An excellent remake of the slow laid back Simon and Garfunkle song. Geoff Tate's voice is the main attraction for this song; just when you think that it can't get any higher, it does, and it never sound like he's screaming. He is truly and amazing singer. <br />14. Dirty Little Secret 4/10- Completely pointless to add on except for diehard fans because it is just a routine song. <br /> <br />Even with the more commercial sound, Queensryche does not abandon the progressive side of their music. It's ashame that they did not keep this sound and idea for their later albums. Even so, this is truly a milestone in both heavy metal and progressive metal. <br />
B00005JMCN|5.0|Seabiscuit is a heart warming story about how a horse, a businessman, a cowboy, and a lost jockey find each other and succeed when no one thought possible. This movie is based on actual events that happen during the depression in the 1930's. The director, Gary Ross, does a fabulous job on showing how the 4 separate stories all eventually run into each other. Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), makes a fortune in selling automobiles in the American West, also owns a small horse called Seabiscuit. Charles runs into a horse whisper named Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), who becomes the horse's trainer. Howard and Tom team up with a struggling jockey and boxer named Red Pollard (Toby Maguire). During the Great Depressions the American public's moral was down, but the story of Seabiscuit gave them hope for a better future. <br /> All four of the main characters were faced with problem. These problems would have made other people give up on the dreams or even their lives. Nothing was looking good until they slowly found their way to each other. It is fate that the four eventually run into each other. Charles Howard's life takes a dramatic twist and he finds himself lonely, until he meets his future wife, Marcela. With her, Charles is able to see life in a different view. He decides he would like to purchase a horse to race, but first he needs a trainer. Charles runs into Tom Smith, an old cowboy who is trying to survive in an ever changing world, and together they start looking for a horse. Tom finds a small horse named Seabiscuit. Seabiscuit is beaten up and very angry at everyone, there seems to be no one who can ride him. Until Tom meets a young man named Red Pollard. Red, just like Seabiscuit, is beaten up and angry at the world. With all the pieces together, the foursome learns and grows together into a powerful force in the racing world.  <br /> This is a classical cheering for the underdog story and I loved it. I thought the movie was very well edited and the acting from everycharacter was awesome. I went into the movie thinking it was a \\"chick flick\\", but I was completely wrong. Toby Maguire did a wonderful job at being a broken down jockey and boxer who is mad at the world and Jeff Bridge was also very convincing as the new businessman of the American West. I really liked how Chris Cooper portrayed Tom Smith, the old cowboys trying to make it in the new West. He is an amazing actor and I loved his character. A really cool part of the movie is when we get shots of the jockeys talking to each other on the horse during the races. It looks very convincing and I love how the actors have a casual conversation in the middle of the race. I would recommend this movie to everyone young and old.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The cancellation of this show only goes to prove one, undenyable fact:  the Fox execs ride the \\"short bus\\" to work (though, are any of us really surpised by that after the cancellation of \\"Futurama\\"?  Didn't think so).  Buy this set, and you won't regret it.  I bought this set and just receintly loaned it to a friend, who never saw it when it aired.  He is now in love with this show and has watched a few of the episodeds more than once (Now, I'm not sure if I'll ever get my set back.  lol).  The special behind-the-scenes stuff is great, too.  They talk, of course, about the cast, but also about why people speak English and Chinese, as well as about the theme song, and a bunch of other stuff. <br /> <br />C'mone.  Just put it in your cart.  Look at how many stars it has.  Look at all the stars the people have given it that've commented on it.  It's well worth it.  The only thing you'll regret about getting this set is that there are no more episodes coming out.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|I have a feeling that the book by Phillip Roth is a good novel.  The story is full of the complexities of a man who lives with a deep secret all his life.  And it questions political correctness and all the assumptions that go along with it.  It's a deeply human story, which brings up questions for which there are no easy answers.  And I'm sure that if I had read the book I would have embraced it completely. But I didn't read the book.  I saw the DVD.  And so I have to judge it on its own terms.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is cast as a college professor in New England.  He's been there for many years and is well respected.  And then he makes the mistake of saying something in class that is not politically correct because it seems to offend African Americans.  He loses his job over this.  And the upset causes his wife to have a heart attack and die.<br /><br />Somewhere along the line he makes a friend of Gary Sinese, a writer to whom he reveals his life story.  Through flashbacks, we learn that the professor is actually an African American himself who has crossed the color line in his youth and never looked back.<br /><br />Meanwhile, while the back-story is told in flashbacks, the professor has an affair with Nicole Kidman, a young woman half his age who works as a janitor.  Her ex-husband is deranged and abusive and actively pursues her.  She, too, is troubled deeply, and has led a difficult life with a lot of sadness.<br /><br />This is a serious story and is very depressing.  The acting is excellent too.  But I just couldn't get into it.  First of all, Anthony Hopkins does not look black.  And I never believed that Nicole Kidman was a working-class janitor.  The young man, Wentworth Miller, who is cast as the professor at a young age, doesn't look like Hopkins.  And the whole situation just didn't seem real.<br /><br />It was a very ambitious try on the part of the filmmakers to bring this story to the screen.  It is certainly a worthwhile film.  But there were just so many problems with its believability that I find it difficult to give it more than a lukewarm recommendation.But there were just so many problems with its believability that I find it difficult to give it more than a lukewarm recommendation. <br />
B00023B1LC|3.0|DO NOT BE FOOLED: This is not a bona fide \\"extended\\" edition. All they've done is scotch tape an extremely poor hard drive quality transferred opening and ending sequence onto the film itself. There is NO seamless branching. Not only that, but director Liman's commentary has been ELIMINATED. <br /> <br />To be sure, this is a quality film, but understand this release for what it is: an enticement to rile up attention for the sequel - nothing more.
B0001US62I|3.0|Religion, sex and violence are a potent mix and director Parker makes a meal of all these.  The bits - and some of them are quite striking - are better than the whole and the film does not quite hold together.  Mr Rourke is brilliant in his cream linen suit which suffers considerably by getting thrown down a lot, splashed with blood, kicked, whacked, beaten, and bitten until it clearly needs a serious dry cleaning by a top New York laundry. Mr Rourke, though playing a loser,  is also reasonably fit, and funny - when asked by the ravishing Ms Rampling whether he speaks French he replies, with a wry grin  \\" Lady, I'm from Brooklyn\\" and when questioned by the rather overweight N'Orleans Constabulary who eye his activities suspiciously, he retorts\\" I'm not up with all this Voodo s...!\\"  He also has some VERY bad dreams.  Atmospheric and weirdly wonderful, with surreal urban and rural landscapes making Louisana a really WEIRD place, this a film worth repeated viewings despite its weaknesses.
B00005M91K|3.0|This film changed my life. I watched this in a theater and was completely mesmerized by its awesome scope. You can't find much fault with the editing, music, and overall presentation. <br /> <br />What I CAN find fault with is the abysmal transfer to dvd. Its initial release was beyond atrocious, it was excrement. Now, this transfer improves upon it, but when you consider that this film was shot on 70mm film, which inherently offers supremely better resolution than standard 35mm, and its anamorphic coding, the picture quality AGAIN fails to deliver. Who in the HELL was (ir)responsible for working this? <br /> <br />Not only that, but fans are slapped in the face with a meager 8 minute \\"featurette\\". THAT'S IT. Something this gorgeous and deep should have had so much more. Personally I would have liked to have seen a subtitling option naming the locations of each shot, all the better to appreciate the majesty and mystery of our world. <br /> <br />To the producers of THIS home video version: GO BACK AND TRY AGAIN!!!!
B0006213WG|5.0|Sum 41 has always been a band that I listened to occassionally but didn't really care about.  They were fun when I was wound up, but I really did not think highly of their musical skills.  This album changes all that. <br /> <br />With Chuck, Sum 41 are able to capture a sound that makes their music feel much more alive and meaningful than it has on their previous albums.  The boys have matured not only emotionally, but instrumentally since their last album and it shows.  The songs are harder, louder, and fiercer than ever before.  The music seems to possess a passion that was missing from all their previous albums.  I think they did a great job on this CD and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it.
0790729628|2.0|Have you seen this? It looks HORRIBLE. I have nothing against windowboxing, but here it is rather severe. Not only that, but the image quality is VERY grainy. <br /> <br />I've heard a new edition is finally forthcoming. If Warner Bros. has a brain among them they will issue this with BOTH original theatrical AND \\"Director's\\" cuts. Commentaries, isolated music scores are also musts.
B000002H6C|5.0|Tracks 1-4 ALONE can carry the album. Its a metal masterpiece. Its so hard to choice my favorite metallica albums in order. all the first 5 are so good. but this has to be the 1st or 2nd on my list
B00004VXF2|1.0|All the people that take this as a serious statement of art are blind Lou fanatics or they love pure nonsense.  Even Lou in his American Masters documentary said that he was \\"stoned out of his mind\\"  when he did this.  It's nothing but noise with the sole purpose to stick it to his record company.  The true Lou fans will love him for such masterpieces as \\"The Blue Mask\\", \\"Transformer\\",\\"Legendary Hearts\\" and \\"New York\\" but they will plug their ears at the first glare of this pile of garbage.  This album works the best for me when i am constipated and i need something to make myself regular.  I just pop this baby in and bam...the monster morning dump happens just like magic!!!!!!  Bravo Lou!!!!   PLEASE NO ENCORES!!!!  from a most loving fan.  O.F.
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums. i dont skip a single track on the CD, and I have a hard time deciding which is my favorite song. There are quite a few \\"edgy\\" songs that are fun to crank up the volume to, such as \\"Harder to Breathe\\" and \\"Shiver\\", then there are songs to mellow out to such as \\"The Sun\\", and \\"Secret\\".  The lyrics add to the quality of the songs.  A lot of them are quite sexual, but in a very sublte way.  You cannot compare this \\"boy band\\" to the likes of the Backstreet Boys or *NSYNC- the overall quality of the songs are just that much better.
B000003TA4|5.0|I love this album its great. too bad fake dumb bands like pearl jam had to rip off nirvana. pearl jam was influenced off tis album and riped if off and said lets make it look like we it. lousy people.
B00003CWL6|1.0|What drives me nuts about this piece of snot--what gets my blood really boiling--is the way it deconstructs what are essentially Hollywood sins and then has the brazen gall to attribute them to suburbia. It's the Champagne set snickering at the yokels with slick condescension: \\"We also may lust after young flesh, pursue gross materialism and sell out to superficiality, but we are among the chosen elite and do it with so much more style that we are entitled to our vapidity.\\" <br /> <br />I dare Hollywood to show me a better example of what it is that this flick purports to deplore than the behaviour of their own mewling overpaid oversexed self-worshipping stars. \\"Hypocrisy\\" doesn't cover it; the word \\"atrocity\\" comes close. Out-of-control mid-life crisis? Hollywood. Nubile young goddesses with trash mouths? Hollywood. Arrested adolescence? Hollywood. Manic materialism? Hollywood. Self-absorption? Hollywood. It beggars belief how many thinking people have been hoodwinked into going along with this perversion of reality. <br /> <br />This flick stands as a shining example of everything that is wrong with modern cinema. It is sanctimonious, stereotypical, pretentious, derivative, trivial, dishonest and phoney. Ohhh, let me count the ways: <br /> <br />Sanctimony--Annette Benning plays Carolyn Burnham, a grotesque parody of a domestic diva. She is a Stepford Wife run amok: so driven by appearances that she sells her soul to bourgeois hell. This flick wants to tell us that it is doing us a favour shoving its distorted mirror in our face. What a vile insult. <br /> <br />Stereotyping--A poor misunderstood dork has a father: who doesn't understand him; who is a sadist; who is a neo-nazi; who is a homophobe; who is a closet GAY sadistic neo-nazi homophobe; who is--gasp--a marine colonel. Why not also show him making blood sacrifices on a pentacle by the moonlight? <br /> <br />Pretension--\\"Beauty is not to be found in the perfect curves of a teenage goddess. Turn and look where you least expect to find it. See the plastic bag floating in the breeze?\\" In the context of a better movie, this might have amounted to something. Here, this film's tin-sentiment paper-thin superficiality just underscores the imagery's wretchedness. <br /> <br />Derivation--From \\"Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\\" to \\"Pleasantville\\" to \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", the supposed emotional bankruptcy of suburbia has been picked to complete and utter death. As targets go, it would be more challenging to hit the broadside of a barn. <br /> <br />Triviality--A man does not have the maturity to find the answers to the big questions in life by looking within himself. Instead, he blackmails his employer, lusts after a cheerleader, gets a McJob, gets high, gets a muscle car and gets dead. We are given to understand that this is terribly profound. <br /> <br />Dishonesty--The catering budget alone for this pestilent excretion exceeded what any suburbanite could hope to spend on a lifetime of redecorating, self-absorption and mid-life splurges. I wonder how much Kevin Spacey got paid. Hypocrisy, thy name is Hollywood. <br /> <br />Phoniness--Why do we need the fiction of an advertising man regressing to adolescence when we can see the real thing shining before us modeled by such luminaries as Jack Nicholson, Madonna and Cher? Muscle cars are, like, so pass. Travolta pacified his mid-life crisis with a private jet. <br /> <br />There are innumerable examples of good films that challenge us to re-examine our lives. But they do so with grace, with wisdom, and most of all, with humility--none of the smarmy, superior, condescending sanctimony that pervades this flick. Had this obscenity been set in Beverly Hills, with Kevin Spacey playing a director, Annette Benning an actress, Thora Birch their Hollywood brat, and Mena Suvari a rapacious starlet, it would have still stunk out the place. But it would have had the single grace of at least aiming for the right targets.
B0006213WG|4.0|If you listen to Sum 41's previous album, \\"Does this Look Infected?\\" almost every song has an underlying subtle political message with the exclusion of Still Waiting, which is an obivous cry for peace. <br /> <br />This CD however, is obviously political, with songs like \\"We're All to Blame\\" which you may not like because of it's style, but it will definitely make you think, because of parts like the amazingly written chorus, \\"...and we're all to blame, we've gone to far, from pride to shame, we're hopelessly blisful and blind to all we are; we want it all, with no sacrifice\\". <br /> <br />The songs are by far darker and progression from the pop-punk radio classics from previous CD's, which nonetheless command respect. The songs on this album in a sense are reminiscant of the sad and angry songs of Linkin Park, and are more emotionally moving, because of their rythm and melodies. <br /> <br />This is an amazing CD, with a great 48 second instrumental song, titled, \\"Intro\\". I know, I know, I have an idea of why it's called that. <br /> <br />Buy this CD, or at least borrow it from a friend, and take a listen, and if you like it, buy it right away, and don't use Kazaa.
B00005JLCI|5.0|There is a moment at the start of this film when Hamlet, until then holding himself rigidly erect through sheer force of will, seizes a moment of privacy and literally deflates with exhaustion and despair. In itself, this perfect gesture would mark Branagh's portrayal a masterful work. But what follows raises his performance to the sublime: He embarks on the \\"O that this too too sullied flesh would melt, /Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew...\\" soliloquy not with Burton's anger, Olivier's melancholy or Gibson's bitterness, but with an exhalation that embodies the emotion most genuine given the circumstances: overwhelming grief. This is a perfect note, and what follows shows an understanding of the play's mental and emotional landscape that puts other portrayals to shame. <br /> <br />I have seen many performances of Hamlet, but I have never seen one as perfectly pitched as this. Branagh's Hamlet is strong, resourceful, thoughtful and restrained. Branagh purposely rejects the psychological poses that other actors find so hard to resist. After all, Hamlet and Richard III are the two Shakespearean plays that afford actors the most range. It's hard playing the Dane on a leash when one can go wild with existential abandon and not only dodge the charge of overacting, but actually attribute such excess to the character. There are few meatier roles in the repertoire that simultaneously offer the actor such depth on the one hand and such leeway on the other. <br /> <br />For me, such moderation exemplifies Branagh's devotion to Shakespeare. It must have been tempting for a man of his talents to show off. But to forego such gestures, to offer in its stead restraint, is to put service before self. <br /> <br />For, of course, Hamlet is restrained. His very life depends on it. His whole course of action is based on it. His safety revolves around it. Hold off the will to strike, restrain the impulse for vengeance, apportion each action in only the most miserly measure. The wallshave ears, conspiracies abound and death lurks around every corner. In such an environment, is it plausible that a man of Hamlet's intelligence would show his hand by indulging in excess? A restrained performance feels right because a restrained course of action is the only course possible for our hero. <br /> <br />This does not stop Hamlet from making bold gestures. But such gestures must always be made under cover, and here again, Branagh shows his creative mettle. The Player King scene provides a counterpoint. Branagh lets go here and shows his excitement when the occasion demands it. Likewise, his graveyard response to Ophelia's death: the cover of madness conflates with reality because Hamlet's act cannot be sustained forever. Branagh knows exactly when to allow the cracks to show. <br /> <br />Those used to earlier works may find Branagh's version overly long and laboured. Many directors have cut out scenes and soliloquies in a misguided attempt to \\"tighten up\\" the production. Branagh makes what I believe is the right decision: to leave them all in because every scene, every soliloquy adds texture and is indispensable to the whole. <br /> <br />The best Hamlet I have seen.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was invited to go to A Perfect Circle concert with some of my friends and I decided to go.  Of course I hadn't listened to them much before, so I decided to buy both CD's since I was asked a couple of months in advance.  The first CD Mer de Noms had a couple of good songs on it, but I quickly fell in love with the second CD, Thirteenth Step.  The first CD is harder rock than the second CD with the exception of Pet and The Outsider.   <br /> After going to the concert I learned that A Perfect Circle is a unique band, but the show was amazing.  I say unique because they are like nothing I have ever listened to before.  At the concert, the singer faced the back the whole time and never faced the crowd, but as weird as that sounds, it only made me more intrigued.  For me it took a couple times of listening to actually start enjoying them.  You will quickly learn that this band has talent.  The music is quite mellow and the lyrics are pretty symbolic.  I personally think that even the name of the CD is symbolic.  There are 12 steps to recovery for alcoholism and each song could be thought of as the effects of alcohol or some other substance maybe.  All of the songs demonstrate this idea, but the most obvious are Weak and Powerless, The Noose, and Vanishing.  The last song, Gravity, makes me believe that there was a decision to stop the substance abuse and take a road to recovery because of the line \\"I choose to live.\\"      <br /> There are three singles on the radio.  Weak and Powerless was the first, Blue was the second, and The Outsider was the third.  Blue does not have a music video.   <br />To be completely honest, I have a new favorite song from the album every other week.  The one song I could do without is number five Vanishing, the lyrics are too repetitive.  My ultimate favorite is number three, The Noose, because the words are compelling all the way up to the last sentence of the song which gives me shivers up and down my spine when I actually think about.Number ten, Pet, is one of the tracks that is heavier than the others and it is awesome.  I believe that they even put a little humor on the album with number nine, The Nurse Who Loved Me.  All of the songs have great lyrics and are so powerful that you will not be able to listen to only one of the songs on the CD; you will have to listen to the whole thing.      <br /> All in all, this is a tremendous CD; you should definitely give it a chance.  If you are looking for something new and different it will not disappoint you.  If you do not like it at first, give it another chance because I guarantee that it will grow on you.  Ending up that you like this band, I suggest you give the band TOOL a try, because it is the same singer.       <br />
B00028HBKC|1.0|It takes a lot of gall to say that this movie is almost straight out of the Bible, as there are MANY places that are grossly exaggerated.  The flogging scene was one such place, where the number of strokes received was simply absurd compared with what is actually in the Bible and what a body can withstand without blacking out.<br /><br />Additionally, the directorial choices left much to be desired, making the scene where Jesus carries the cross last about 3 or 4 times as long as it needed to have in relation to the rest of the film.  I found myself saying to the screen more than once during that time, \\"Will you just get there already??\\"  It was like watching Frodo with the number of times he fell down in a single scene.<br /><br />I also don't understand why the director chose to ignore well-documented historical facts such as that crucifixion was done through the wrists and not the hands, as the hands would not be able to support the weight of the body when nailed the way Jesus is depicted in this movie.<br /><br />I also found it odd that even though the director was supposedly going for accuracy, the crucified men were not naked, as historically was done by the Romans.  Apparently it's okay to watch violence on one's deity but not nudity of that deity for whatever bizarre reason?<br /><br />My summary:<br /><br />This is a poorly directed snuff film with little regard for historical accuracy; but since it's a religious film, it is zealously defended by those who don't care to actually THINK about it.

Nicholson stars as Jack Napier, an underworld crime boss.  Keaton stars as Bruce Wayne, a millionaire business man who's alternative personality is that of Batman.  Kim Basinger stars as Vicki Vail, a magazine photographer.  She comes to Gotham to check on Batman.  Robert Wuhl stars as Alexander Knox, a reporter for the Gotham newspaper.  He has written a story about Batman, and Vail proposes that they combine on another follow up story.

The police are tripped off by his boss Carl Grissom, played by Jack Palance, that Jack is at Axis.  Soon, Jack and his thugs are cleaning out Axis when the police arrive.  A gun battle between the 2 groups starts.  Commissioner Gordon, played by Pat Hingle, shows up and says he wants Jack taken alive.  Batman shows up on the scene as well.  Jack punctures a large container, spilling chemicals all over while he tries to escape.  A blast of hot steam hits Jack in the face and he falls over a railing and into a vat of chemicals.  He emerges with a totally different appearance.  He now has a permanent smile on his face due to nerve damage suffered from falling into the chemicals.  Also, he now paints his skin white and dyes his hair green.  He has become the Joker.  His first act is to kill Grissom.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vicki and Bruce are becoming very close and Vicki spends the night at Bruce's house.<br /><br />Joker has taken over the crime scene in Gotham.  He has all other crime bosses under his contol.  Soon, bullets are flying and people are running for their lives.  Joker begins tampering with the chemicals in certain types of cosmetics which results in several deaths.  He has also become infatuated with Vicki after seeing her picture.  The next stop is the Gotham museum, where several valuable artworks are destroyed. Vicki had planned to meet Bruce at the museum, but Joker got there first.  Batman arrives just in the nick of time to save Vicki from Joker.  After another run-in with Joker's thugs, Batman and Vicki head to the Bat Cave.

Bruce tells Joker that he knows who he really is.  Joker appears to have shot Bruce, but when Vicki turns around, Bruce is gone.  Meanwhile, Knox has been doing some research and tells Vicki that Bruce's parents were murdered and Bruce witnessed everything as a small boy.<br /><br />The mayor postpones the 200th anniversary festival, but Joker interrupts the broadcast to inform the citizens of Gotham that he's planning his own festival where he will drop $20 million in cash on the crowd.  He also calls out Batman to reveal his true identity.  After having a chance to study his parents' police file, Bruce realizes that Jack Napier is the one who killed them.

A large balloon floating above the float begins to release a cloud of poisonous gas on the crowd.  Soon, people are running and trying to escape from the gas.  Batman swoops down in the Batplane, cuts the ropes on the balloons, and pulls them away.  However, Joker manages to shoot down the Batplane.  Batman emerges from the plane and sets off after Joker, who now has an unwilling Vicki with him.<br /><br />Will Batman arrive in time to save Vicki, or will Joker succeed in his quest to have Vicki for himself?<br /><br />This is a first-rate superhero movie.  Jack Nicholson turns in one of his all-time best performances as the Joker.  His one-liners are great, and his performance is truly spectacular.  Michael Keaton and Kim Basinger are excellent as well.  I wish that Keaton would have portrayed Batman in the whole series of Batman films.  The special effects are great, and Batman's \\"toys\\", such as the Batmobile, Batplane, and his utility belt are all extremely cool.  I highly recommend this great movie.  The action is non-stop and the acting, especially by Nicholson, will leave you wanting more.  Watch and see a cool superhero movie and the beginning of an excellent series of movies./> <br />Will Batman arrive in time to save Vicki, or will Joker succeed in his quest to have Vicki for himself? <br /> <br />This is a first-rate superhero movie.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|Straight off the bat, I must admit that I am not a die-hard Slipknot fan.  I enjoy listening to the occasional group of their past songs, such as Wait and Bleed, Left Behind.  So really, songs which aren't predominantly screaming (however, I do recogise that this is a song form and NOT rubbish). <br />The genre of music that Slipknot originally associated themselves with was not particularly my taste, except for the occasional song as mentioned above.  However, I decided to have a listen to this new CD to see whether it was worth a purchase or whether it was screaming and swearing like past albums.  Needless to say, I was stunned!  I learnt on that day that Slipknot have more than one dimension to their style of music, and tracks such as Vermillion Pt 2 and Circle have become favourites of mine. <br />Other tracks on the CD were a lot more heavy than the two mentioned, however, there was style, rhythm, structure and credibility to what they have created.  They did not contain pointless yelling, but rather expressed deeper meaning and subtle emotion... and not a single swear the entire CD! <br /> <br />Remarkabley, Slipknot's new album is not simply directed to one particular genre.  They have expanded their horizons to entice more listeners into accepting their music, and I for one am part of that transition!  Many of my friends have listened to this music and loved it, not realising that Slipknot could create such concentrated music.  Well, they showed us!
B00005JNJ7|1.0|I thought that this movie was going to make fun of America trying to be the world police but instead seemed to make the most fun of action films, Michael Moore and the Screen Actors Guild by calling them F.A.G.s. Hehheh, hehheh. Now that's just really funny calling someone a fag. NOT. Well maybe if you're a teenage, homophobic boy. <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that the only real people in the film are Michael Moore, Hans Blix, North Korea's Kim-Jung-Il and a host of progressive actors protesting the US war in Iraq. Seems that many in need of roasting were left out of the film: O'Reilly, authors of Patriot Act, proclaimers of the Christian right, etc. Perhaps what is really scary is that the film censored out any real right-wingnuts because they were scared or Parker and company have become O'Reilly \\"undecided\\" ditto heads. It's truly a film worthy of Fox-downed TV. <br /> <br />And, saying that something is funny because it is satire, does not make it so. Lampooning progressive actors who are speaking out against a current war was simply a humorless cheap-shot. But perhaps that's the point, the whole thing is meaningless. This movie is a sell-out to the almighty buck, not satire but nihilism at its finest. <br /> <br />But then, if you can't get enough of banal plots, dolly sex, projectile barf, political confusion, bad music, racism, and potty humor with no redeeming quality or humor, then this is the movie for you.
B0000013GT|4.0|I like this, but it is not a southernplaya.....  It's hot and a must have if you like the OLDSCHOOL OutKast.  Not this Roses, Prototype bullcrap they got out now.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I knew I wanted to see this movie immediately when I learned it was taken from a previously published science fiction story about someone going back millions of years into time, accidentally stepping on a butterfly, and then returning to the present, only to discover the entire course of future history was changed because of that mistakenly killed butterfly.  <br /> <br />I thought originally the movie would be based on the written scifi  story due to the title containing the word 'butterfly', given the stepped-on butterfly in the published story. I was also told 6 months before this movie hit movie theaters by another friend who keeps up with the movie industry that it was connected to the published scifi story. When I saw the TV ads, they made me realize the movie would have nothing to do with the written scifi story; it would still touch on Chaos theory, but in a different way.  <br /> <br />Now I realize the butterfly is also a reference to the fact that every time Chaos theory is described, invariably the example is invoked of a butterfly's wing's moving air in one part of the world that ends up causing a hurricane in another part of the world. So, two different sorts of butterflies being invoked here simultaneously in the title.  <br /> <br />But I noticed that the DVD in its interviews refers to the butterfly of Chaos theory, and nowhere in the DVD is anything said about the science fiction story with the stepped-on butterfly in its plot, the only indication of its influence is how changing the past unavoidably changes the present too and the word 'butterfly' in its title.  <br /> <br />(Sorry, I don't have that written scifi story's title or author of that story with me off the top of my head as I'm typing this. I don't think the title of that story is 'The Butterfly Effect', it's likely something else. Maybe someone else's review can provide that information.) <br /> <br />Back in college I had many talks with one friend in particular (we're both fans of scifi) about whether we could go back in time, but wouldn't that cause problems? When I saw this movie, I also watched with those past conversations in the back of my mind.  <br /> <br />Because I'm deaf, however, I was forced to wait until this movie reached DVD format, because I did not hear of it being shown with captions in movie theaters anywhere in my area. <br /> <br />When I finally saw the movie on DVD, I felt it was well worth the wait! <br /> <br />There are some scenes in the first half of the movie that seemed to make no sense. When I got to the second half of the movie the logic of those scenes that I thought strange suddenly became clear.  <br /> <br />I did hope that the real life Ashton, who plays the main character, would be a lot better than he is in his TV program. His program I don't really care for and have nearly always made a point of quickly clicking past it with my TV remote. I just don't understand how such drek is even allowed to exist on TV. Well, surprise! In this movie I think he's really terrific, a very serious and dramatic contrast to how he looks on TV.  <br /> <br />Hard to believe how many different versions the real life Melora (who plays Ashton's girlfriend in the movie) can act, are they all really the same person?? In one time line I barely even recognized her, I had to look twice, she was that incredible. She's obviously a marvelously skilled actress. I don't think I ever saw her before this movie. <br /> <br />After Ashton goes back and changes time, there is a sudden rush of scenes in a brighter color, signifying new events and memories being formed as a result of some event in the past being changed, then the movie returns to normal colors and a newly-changed present. Those lighter-colored scenes occur very fast and I wasn't always sure of what I was seeing. When those particular scenes appear in the movie, you really have to have your eyes on the ball; look away just one instant or even merely blink, you've missed it. It was sometimes simply too rapid to cognitively process, at least for me, so I will have to go back and re-watch those scenes on the DVD to understand what I was seeing. <br /> <br />I have to doublecheck to make sure I'm right, I could very well be wrong, I think the first time those lightly-colored scenes appear, the scenes flash by a little slower, later on in the movie I think they go by faster now that we know their meaning. <br /> <br />About the three different endings on the DVD -- I didn't like the director's preferred ending that appears in the director's cut. I say this even though it was much more dramatic than the other two endings and left me thinking even more about what could go really wrong with changing one's past. In contrast, the theater release's ending, and the other ending that wasn't used, I preferred either of those. The best ending I preferred was the third alternative ending that was not used in the director's cut nor in the theater release, because it left open new possibilities. <br /> <br />I devoured the entire DVD, not only watching the original theater release but also the two alternative endings and all of the other extras such as how the movie was made.  <br /> <br />Thank you, thank you, thank you, New Line Home Entertainment, for choosing to close caption the entire DVD including the interviews and how the movie was made! I really hate it when DVDs close-caption only the movie or TV episodes, then leave the rest of the DVD or DVD set (the interviews, etc.) virtually uncaptioned. (Perfect example: In Showtime's Queer as Folks' 2nd season DVD set, the episodes are all closed captioned on the first 5 DVDs, but nothing on the 6th and final DVD is closed captioned, and this is where the interviews, how the film was made, etc. are, and as a result, even though I enjoyed watching the first 5 DVDs in the set, in the end I felt upset and pissed off with Showtime.) <br /> <br />I liked the Infinifilm version of the movie, a new technology I haven't seen before, thought it was interesting. The movie can be seen both outside and within the Infinifilm format. Don't remember which cut is the main one shown inside the Infinifilm format, the theater cut or the director's cut, but you can see the other two possible endings while within Infinifilm. At various points in the movie where a certain indicator appears briefly, if you choose to click your remote at that point before the indicator disappears and the movie then resumes, you get automatically and briefly switched to a portion of whatever interview touched on that part or a film short about how that part of the movie was made. At the end of that clip you get switched back and the film automatically resumes where it paused before.  <br /> <br />Speaking as a deaf person, the interview clips in the Infinifilm however are easier to understand and to follow only if the original interviews from which those clips were taken is seen in their entirety. (These interviews appear in full elsewhere on the DVD; I saw the clips first, before I saw the interviews, and then realized the clips had come out of these interviews.) The reason I emphasize being deaf here is that the close captions get messed up in the film clips inside the Infinifilm, while in the full interview format the same closed captions come across completely. Within the Infinifilm, sometimes the first sentence that's said and which should be closed captioned, doesn't appear in some of the film clips. The rest of the captions within each clip come out just fine.  <br /> <br />I finally realized this is probably an artifact of the Infinifilm technology that definitely needs to be fixed, and not a result of sloppy captioning, because the clips were clearly taken from the filmed interviews after the latter were already fully captioned, since the captioning in both is virtually identical.  <br /> <br />This problem disappeared if I ran the Infinifilm, and then used the remote to fast-forward straight from one short film clip to the next clip, and made a point of skipping watching any part of the movie itself within the Infinifilm format. <br /> <br />If you're someone who seeks or needs captions, or know someone who's either, and seek a DVD that provides full access to all parts of it, not just the movie portion, this DVD is terrific. The closed captioning is top quality, and the accessibility of this DVD (aside from the small problem with the Infinifilm technology) is 100%.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is a very wonderful and is a piece of movie with much intense and suspense scenes. The background scene of this movie especially on the Titanic(the scenery) is truly admirable. It is so beautiful and it's perfect to symbolize romance that this movie is focusing on.    Besides, it is an unbelievably touching story. The story line moves slowly and I could really understand the entire movie(the message and overall meaning that it brings) well. Generally, the messages that this movie brings are FREEDOM, HAPPIENESS and HOLD ON! The performence by the great actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are very amazing and they capture my attention to this movie. I can feel the presence of real feelings and romance in their characters throughout the movie. I mean it is not just falsely made. I would be happier if Jack Dawson(DiCaprio) didn't die in the movie. It could end with a better ending instead of the really sad one.    Other that that, I also like the soundtracks of this movie. The songs in this movie are so soothing and sweet(especially 'My Heart Will Go On'). So, in overall this movie is well-acted, got a beautiful story line(touching as well) and sweet soundtracks. It is PERFECT!. With all the great aspects in it, I have no idea who can reject this movie. Those who hasn't watch this movie should really go and watch it. It is a movie that not to be missed. Until now, there's still no other movies that can be better than this one. This is a movie of true standard and quality! A great MASTERPIECE!!!
6305127638|5.0|\\"First Contact\\" is the eighth Star Trek film, and hit the movie screens in 1996. Directed by Jonathon Riker (Will Riker), it was the first in the series of movies to focus solely on the crew of the Next Generation. Following the events of \\"Generations\\", it was also the first to feature the Sovereign-class Enterprise-E. <br /> <br />The film opens in 2373, as the Borg launch their second invasion of Federation space. The Borg are a ruthless and highly adaptable enemy. Part organic, part machine, each drone is connected to a single hive mind - allowing for no individual reasoning, thought or action. Their quest for perfection has led them to assimilate thousands of other civilisations into their collective. Their first invasion - 6 years previously - had been covered in the TNG episodes \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" Parts 1 and 2. During that invasion, Captain Picard himself had been assimilated and renamed Locutus of Borg. He was eventually freed from the Collective, though there are certain scars he still carries.  <br /> <br />As a result of Picard's previous ordeal, Starfleet's top brass order the Enterprise to stay away from the battlefield. Picard, however, disobeys the order, and takes command of the fleet engaging the Borg Cube. The knowledge he gained as Locutus allows the Starfleet vessels to destroy the invading ship, though not before the launch of a smaller sphere-shaped vessel. This vessel creates a temporal vortex and disappears into the past, with the Enterprise following in its wake. The two ships emerge in 2063, close to Earth - the day before the legendary Zephram Cochrane's first warp flight. This flight led to the first meeting of Humans and Vulcans, which eventually led to the formation of the Federation. The Borg mean to prevent this flight - in doing so, the Federation will never have existed and will allow the easy assimilation of Earth. Picard divides his command crew - some, led by Riker and Troi, work on the surface to ensure the success of Cochrane's flight. Picard, however, leads the fight against a group of Borg who have invaded the Enterprise.  <br /> <br />\\"First Contact\\" is my favorite of the Trek movies. There's plenty of action and humor - not only do the Enterprise officers have to battle the best 'bad guys' in the Star Trek universe, they also have to deal with Tequila, Rock 'n' Roll and a very different Zephram Cochrane to the one they learnt about in school. It also shows a very different side to the usually diplomatic Picard and a very clear route for Data to become more human. <br />

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I think that this album is the best thing to come out of Scotland since the kilt. Hell, I don't think it would be any better if the guys were wearing kilts when they recorded it. Although the album is catchy, espically when you're listening to it while walking to school in the morning after a night of drinking, it's the live shows which really determine if a band's got it. And these guys have it. Any band that bows after a show has got some creditablity in my opinion. It's such a great thing to dance in your room to \\"darts of pleasure\\" and not feel embarassed one bit because this music was made for girls to dance to. Certainly this album is enjoyable in the dark of the matinee and everywhere else in town.
B00005JN7O|4.0|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" represents the triumph of style over substance, the P-40 Tomahawk over mechanical monsters, and computer generated actors over death itself.  That last part is actually the tip of an ethical iceberg that has the potential of being the biggest point of contention in Hollywood since Ted Turner broke out his box of crayons and started colorizing black & white classic films.  But for now we can just enjoy director-writer Kerry Conran's tribute to both the decade and the serials of the 1930s done with enough digital magic to make going over the rainbow seem like an unnecessary journey.<br /><br />The story begins in a New York City untouched by either the Great Depression or the madness of Hitler's Nazis.  But there is still a Teutonic threat beginning to encroach on the civilized world courtesy of the brilliant, mysterious, and apparently evil Dr. Totenkopf (enjoy the surprise).  Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), an intrepid reporter for \\"The Chronicle,\\" stumbles upon the first significant clue about the good doctor only to be distracted by the legion of giant killer mechanical men walking down the streets of New York City.  In defense of the city comes Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), the Sky Captain himself, whose P-40 Tomahawk with its Flying Tiger teeth has been souped up by his sidekick, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi).  Of course Polly and Joe had something in the past, so there is a lot of subtext to her backseat driving as they go merrily along.<br /><br />In the grand tradition of the Saturday morning serial the hero and his gal get on the trail of the bad machines, fueled by Dex being kidnapped by a mysterious Asian woman (Bai Ling) and helped by a few old friends, most notably Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), the commander of a most unusual British airship.  The running gag for the second half of the film is that Polly has only two shots left in her camera and keeps bypassing visual wonders, such as the real Shangri-La, because there could be something better around the corner.<br /><br />Visually, \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is a visual treat, filled in the same sort of sepia tones we associate with the first reel of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" a film that is clearly a reference point for Conran.  Much is made of the fact that the actors performed in front of a blue screen to which Conrad added all the dazzling images of the mechanical creations in the art deco style of a lot of the architecture we see in the film, all glowing with a blue light.  But Law, Paltrow, Jolie and the rest of the cast get credit for playing these roles straight without ever getting too tongue in cheek.  This is an earnest homage and not parody, and while the result might not be great cinema it is still as much fun as any of the Saturday morning serials it wants to emulate.<br /><br />This film wants to be \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" for a new generation of filmgoers weaned on computer generated images, but it is not up to that level.  The difference can be simply quantified by saying Kerry Conran is not Steven Spielberg, but it would be more worthwhile to point out that in his first film Conran has a much better handle on the cinematic over the dramatic aspects of movie making.  His next project is the long awaited adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's \\"A Princess of Mars,\\" with a screenplay by Mark Protosevich (\\"The Cell\\"), which should help firm up the dramatic half of the equation.  Given the stunning eye candy provided in his debut effort, whatever Conran does in the future will certainly be worth a look.there could be something better around the corner.   <br /> <br />Visually, \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is a visual treat, filled in the same sort of sepia tones we associate with the first reel of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" a film that is clearly a reference point for Conran.

0375422307|5.0|History of a young girl, blossoming into a rebellious and freedom-loving teenager, first during the days of protest against the Shah, then under the greater repression of the mullacracie. Would be hard to find a book that goes straighter to the essential points. Written in black-white comic book form.
0739313126|4.0|This was a great read but not worth all the hype it received.  I'm not going to reiterate the plotline because it has been done here, many times.  You don't need to be religious to read this book.  It's more of a suspense/mystery novel that will be sure to please everyone.  The end was a bit choppy and seemed to jump all over but overall, this is a highly recommended book.
B0006213WG|3.0|Although I really like sum 41, this album does not show the creative spark of their first three albums. According to the cd insert, the cd has something to do with war, somthing about the congo. If there is a story, if they are trying to get a point across, i am not getting the picture. Are they anti-war?  anti-american? the cd relies too much on rhyming day ,away, and way and the lyrics aren't focusing on anything in particular across all the tracks. the guitarwork is great as usual, even if nothing creative or new from the first 3 albums. there were some stringed instruments on one track, nothing too fancy, similar to green day's use of strings <br /> <br />to me, it seems like the band was greatly affected by some experiences with war in some poverty-stricken nations, but they lack the social vision and maturity to convey exactly what is important about what they saw. they need some deep reflection and a larger vocabulary in order to grapple with topics like war. it doesn't really add anything to say \\"there's no solution\\", although day clearly rhymes with away as they demonstrate on at least half of the tracks. the band could be angry, or they could be making on stand on an issue, but i'm really not sure.
B00006BTCA|5.0|This album is pure mood, a beautiful, haunting, even disturbing burst of energy and zeal. It's the kind of music that you have to listen to while in some kind of motion - whether it be in a car, on foot, whatever... Interpol's debut album is definitely worth owning.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a book written by Harper Lee.  The story is narrated by a girl named Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout.  The Finch family lives in a town called Maycomb, Alabama during the Great Depression.  Scout's father Atticus is a lawyer in town.  In the story Atticus Finch has chosen to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.  This is a very serious crime in these times especially because Maycomb is a very racist town.  The Finch family knows that Robinson is innocent, but the tricky part is getting the rest of the town to believe it too.   <br /> <br /> At the trial, Scout and her older brother Jem sit in the colored section of the court to prove that there is no difference between black people and white people.  The book is a very good book about racism during the Great Depression.  One family takes matters into their own hands to try and solve the nation's problem and let everyone know that everyone is equal.  The family encounters many problems because the rest of the community is not willing to listen to them.  The rest of the community feels that Atticus is wrong in choosing to defend this man. <br />  <br /> Another character in the book is Boo Radley.  Boo lives in a big, creepy house on the corner of the street and no one has ever seen him come out.  Throughout the book Scout and her brother, Jem, have many encounters with Boo.  While they still think he is really creepy, they also realize that he is a person just like you and me. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite books.  The book is narrated by Scout, a child.  I always admired the innocence of a child.  Scout looks at Robinson and doesn't see a black man but instead she sees a man who is being wrongly accused.  When she looks at Boo she see a normal man.  I think this is a book everyone should read.  So many times we judge people without getting to know them.  That is what the book is really about. <br />
0790729393|2.0|This movie has been out for years and somehow I had missed it. I picked it up recently at the movie store and boy it gives new meaning to the term &quot;renter&quot;.<br />Let me begin by stating that the film was mildly entertaining, thus the two stars I have given it. However, the rest is down hill.<br />The overriding problem with this movie is the contrived plot. This could have been a serious drama, with excellent actors, about horendous child abuse, but it was reduced to a second rate revenge plot, that wasn't even convincing.  The court scenes were pure non-sense, no Judge in his right mind would allow a trial to unfold like that, I haven't seen a confession from a witness like that since the old Perry Mason episodes on TV, did anyone else want to yell at this guy and remind him of his 5th amendment rights.  I'm not even American and I could have figured that one out!<br />The young actors were very good, but the story was weak. Some have described the movie as brutal yet what we actually are presented with is a lot of voice over and flashing around. I agree with one other reviewer that a much more compelling and realistic movie concerning institutional abuse was the Boy's of St. Vincent. In that film we feel the victims pain, see the crushed lives and see justice done in a court room, but not in some contrived plot.<br />Deniro's character also troubled me.  I like Deniro a lot but I was not convinced that this priest would throw away all of his ethics and lie to protect a murderer in this revenge as morality play.  Perhaps I could have been convinced but this movie did not convince me that this faithful priest would participate in this crime. <br />The actual DVD is also a disappointment with a double sided format that needs to be flipped half way through.  If you want to see this movie I would suggest you rent it.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I had first heard of this band when checking out that a lost prophets tour was coming with a few other bands in my area... <br /> <br />I heard a few samples from these guy, went and bought the cd right away, I have been completely blown away and these guys have truly changed my entire view on music...I was beginning to get bored with music as a whole...but after listening to this cd I've discovered an entire new sound...amazing... <br /> <br />1. Helena - At first was a little iffy, but has grown to be one of my top 3 or 4 on this whole cd, builds up to an amazing chorus and ending... <br />2. Give 'Em Hell Kid - Didnt really like the beginning, but the chorus is so catchy and crazy I just cant get enough :) <br />3. To the End - Im loving the lyrics in this one, so many great lines and of course catchy and creative... <br />4. You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison - Starts out cool, and just explodes later in the song, loving this song...Life..is...but..a...DREAMM!!!! I love it... <br />5. I'm Not Okay (I Promise) - I figured this would be the most mainstream track on the cd, I like it alot though, I see they made a video for it, personally I hope it doesnt get out there and air on MTV because every little kid will think its the greatest...which I guess these guys deserve it, so yeah...great song, very catchy <br />6. Ghost of You - Im not a fan of their slower stuff, but I still love this song :) <br />7. Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You - Great song, starts off quiet, then just explodes later, lovin it <br />8. Interlude - not much to say about this one <br />9. Thank You for the Venom - Has been my favorite on the cd for SO long, but another track has been recently taking it over! But man this song, I cant say enough about it, just great... <br />10. Hang 'Em High - Starts out cool, sounds almost westernish...another great song <br />11. It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish - Here it is, the battler for my favorite, Its just so ENERGETIC, amazing! <br />12. Cemetery Drive - Another great, love the lyrics, the beats, everything <br />13. I Never Told You What I Do for a Living - Awesome way to end a cd, great song, heck every song on this cd is worth listening to over and over again <br /> <br />This cd has not left my player for months, and Im not getting sick of it yet, Im seeing them live in a few days, I CANT WAIT <br /> <br />I recommend this cd to anyone who likes to get pumped up (driving to school in the morning), it wakes me up for anything... <br /> <br />All around best cd i've heard for a while, GO MCR!
B00009UW0N|5.0|Carpenter stroke in the middle of a  myth and became it in a horror story . It is more than obvious the remarkable influence of Hitchcock in the behavior of Michael Meyers as a murder whose mental breakdown is ruled stiffly by serious and disturbing prejudgements installed in his psiquis a long time ago . He punishes all those people who deflect from the right way of the moral and good customes .<br /><br />Halloween is a fundamental ritual in all the western world . It allows us drowning in the underworld and enjoy just for a night this funny encounter with the otherness , a brief moment with the unreality .<br /><br />When Jean Cocteau filmed Orpheus in the last forties , he showed with outstanding  mastery the otherness behind the mirror . That jump to the dark world was absorbed for Carpenter and employed with all the available effects in that age .<br /><br />The result was amazing. Having earned $50 million on a meager $320.000 investment, Halloween still ranks as one of the most  winner movies of all time .<br /><br />Carpenter plays hard around the concept of dislocation and lack of ubiquity. He made the most significative use of the wide frame which allowed him to obtain some frightening visuals . Notice these two related circumstances : Jamie Lee Curtis is the daughter of Janet Leigh the victim in Psycho and the inner dragons present in the disturbed mind of Michael Myers are very similar to those in Mr. Bates in Psycho. Notice Alan Bates murdered Leigh , who was an adultery and besides stole $ 40.000  , while Myers in its puritanical morality cleaning murders the sexually promiscuous Judith, Annie and Lynda and forgiving? The only virgin of the group : Laurie .<br /><br />Obviously there are another points of view my kind reader , such as the fact of opening the gate for future sequels .<br /><br />Pleasance as Loomis is great and Curtis wonderful in her role . An instantaneous cult movie from its initial release.
B00000IGGA|4.0|The worst thing you could possibly do with any Tom Waits record released in the last twenty years or so is to judge it on just one (or even two) listens. I could almost bet my life on the fact that the great majority (all?) of the one-star reviews that Waits' albums tend to get here and there, dotted in between the glowing praise, are from people who did just that - listened it to once, and made up their minds. <br /> <br />Waits is an artist that always evolves from album to album, always explores new ways of expression, new instrumentation, new atmospheres and soundscapes. He is never complacent, nor does he try to appeal to us through familiarity, and it is exactly this that often means that to \\"get\\" a Tom Waits record you have to let it seep in; the first spin of the album will often leave you in \\"sensory overload\\" after the first few songs and make you deaf to all that makes his music so brilliant. Mainstream music can rely on it's generic familiarity to get it's hooks on you quickly, while music with more depth and character will inevitably require a little more patience initially.  <br /> <br />When Mule Variations came out, I bought it immediately, with high expectations... and after the first listen, I felt disappointed. The album sounded much too Country/Folk to me, and Country music is something I'm not particularly fond of to say the least (Though my tolerance has increased much due to Waits - \\"A Little Rain\\" from the Bone Machine album even makes it among my favourites). Big in Japan felt abbrasive, many of the songs felt too simple somehow, and I think that my disappointment clouded my vision. Had I been asked afterwards what the highlites were, I'd have been hard pressed to come up with any, and that would have been my failing, not the albums; since the highs of this album are very high indeed.  <br /> <br />With several more listens, I began to see things a little differently - the songs I didn't like I still had to admit were good, in some objectivesense; I'm not so arrogant as to suggest that any kind of music that doesn't strike a chord with me couldn't possibly be good music - there is good music out there that just isn't my kind of music, and that's due to my limitations, not the music's. Perhaps some of the one-star reviewers just haven't grasped this concept.  <br /> <br />This album is perhaps a somewhat surpricing divider among Waits fans, in that some view it as a slight lapse on Waits' part, whereas others view it as one of his best works - and interestingly, I've found that people that don't much care for Mule Variations, tend to view Alice as a \\"return to brilliance\\", wheras the fans of Mule Variations often denounce Alice as a slight lapse from Wait's top form. I think the difference can be explained by general musical tastes and backgrounds - for people who don't listen to country/folk outside of Waits, or only listen to very little of it, like myself, Mule Variations has an uphill struggle to reveal it's strengths; there's little chance of instant liking. (This is perhaps why Mule Variations appears to be so much better liked in North America than in Europe; Country music is a very minor genre in Europe, wheras it is hugely popular in North America) <br /> <br />Similarly, those without a predisposition towards misty, Jazzy moods, may find Alice difficult to get into - and those who have sympathies towards that sort of music will immediately recognize Alice as a masterpiece. <br /> <br />For the patient, that are willing to give it a second (and a third) chance before passing judgement, Waits will reward them by expanding their musical horizons and opening brand new vistas for exploration. Mule Variations did this for me. <br /> <br />My favourite songs on the albums include  \\"Cold Water\\" - an achingly simple folk song with a real chickenwire-feel; \\"Chocolate Jesus\\", a brilliant, compassionately funny song about a man (woman?) who combines a chocolate addicition with an aversion for the rigorsof traditional religious worship; \\"Take It With Me\\", an absolutely beautiful ballad, a Waits classic; and \\"Come On Up To The House\\", a gospel-influenced song that always brings a smile to my face with the line \\"Come on down from the cross, we can use the wood!\\".  <br /> <br />Still, I can't claim that I unreservedly like this album: there are some songs there that just don't do it for me, and one - \\"Pony\\" - that just makes me gringe. That one just won't grow on me, no matter how many times I've heard it. I've tried, honestly! :)  <br /> <br />So in conclusion: <br />(False) Initial impression - 2 stars, After 3+ listens - 4 stars, and an understanding why for some people this may be among the best of Waits.
6302662648|4.0|SNEAKERS is about a group of security analysts led by Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) who are hired by the National Security Agency to steal a special black box, created by a world renown mathematician, that has the capability to breaking all cryptographic codes.  However, the group soon discovers that they weren't working for the NSA and instead are caught up in a twisted game of espionage with a man who wants revenge against Bishop.<br /><br />SNEAKERS is a really entertaining movie to watch.  The plot is somewhat far-fetched, despite being more realistic than the typical spy-thriller movie.  The movie is made even more enjoyable because of top quality acting from an All-Star cast:  Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley, Sidney Poitier, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Timothy Busfield, and Mary McDonnell.  Besides the acting, another element that makes this movie just a notch above the typical spy-thriller is it's score. The music really elevates the movie and helps hide some of the minor discrepancies with the plot.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie.
B0000026NC|3.0|The Delicate Sound of Thunder is the worst live album that Pink Floyd, or any incarnation thereof, ever released. Not, as some would have you believe, the best live document of a band whose 27-year recording career was dwarfed by their fantastic stage shows. Jernau (two reviews down) has several things wrong in his 5-star review. Perhaps he should take a look at a proper discography, or maybe just actually read the liner notes to those albums he professes such misplaced affection for. <br /> <br />Most of the reviews here compare the Delicate Sound of Thunder with  PULSE, two virtually-indistinguishable post-Roger Waters live albums. Jernau rightly points out that Pink Floyd have another live album, 1969's Ummagumma. But Syd Barrett, the \\"Crazy Diamond\\" alluded to in practically every Floyd album since his departure, was long gone by that time. The live material on that quaint old 60's double-album has a very strange nervous energy-- the band are working like gangbusters to put on that they never needed Syd in the first place. Kind of like what is attempted on Delicate Sound, only it takes an army of session players to replace Syd AND Roger. <br /> <br />What's this about material from The Final Cut on the Delicate Sound disc? I don't see any, maybe because none was played. Richard wasn't even around for that record, and Nick was hardly there at all. Why should they trot out cuts from a record that they had so little to do with? Like, say, A Momentary Lapse of Reason? Oh, I know, because David Gilmour tells them to. Momentary Lapse is so grossly over-represented here: this is one of many cases where Pink Floyd were releasing a record simply to make a point about what they were capable of doing without one of their former members. <br /> <br />Now, for PULSE on the other hand (which is, despite what Jernau claims, EXACTLY the same band, except for the saxophonist and backup singers who do much better jobs respectively), we have a finer balance between the old and newsongs, with more polished and considered performances. A complete run-through of Dark Side of the Moon (instead of the disjointed, muddled performances here on Delicate Sound) is a feather in PULSE's cap. Plus the sound is shimmering with brightness and clarity, traits nowhere to be found on Delicate Sound of Thunder. However, since by this time Pink Floyd were all about visuals and not, God forbid, breaking new musical ground, the video versions (soon to be DVD for PULSE) are superior in both cases. <br /> <br />Olly Buxton (immediately below me) has it right in his review. DST is still a guilty pleasure, for a great many reasons... not least of which is the inclusion of \\"Dogs of War,\\" widely considered the most humiliating Pink Floyd song in their whole canon. Well, the Floyd at their worst are still better than most bands at their best. But maybe Mr. Buxton should listen to Roger Waters's \\"In the Flesh - LIVE\\" album or better yet the DVD, where his session men actually manage to capture the intimacy and warmth of the pre-Wall Pink Floyd far better than David Gilmour & Pink Floyd 1987 Ltd. could ever hope to do.

0446310786|5.0|Growing up, my mom was a high school English teacher. Every year I would hear her talk about 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and how wonderful of a book it was. I always thought she was saying 'Tequila Mockingbird', so I never really understood. It wasn't until my 7th grade year, when I was assigned to read this book, did I 1) realize how right my mother was and 2) what the actual name of the book was. I have to say, I was quite apprehensive to read it, due to the fact that the title seemed like the whole book was going to be about killing a mockingbird. I guess I judged a book by it's cover, which is mainly what this beautifully written book is about. <br /> <br />Scout Finch (Jean Louise Finch was her birth name) is a young girl growing up with her older brother, Jem, and her lawyer-dad, Atticus. As the only girl around the house, besides their African American help, Calpurnia, Scout is an entergetic tomboy. With their new friend, Dill from Meridian, Mississippi, Jem and Scout go on many adventures, mainly including the town-mystery, Boo Radley. <br /> <br />This book is not just about a young girl becoming a young lady, it's about her having to realize that not all of society is as understanding to change or different people as she and her family were. The case of Tom Robinson (an African American man accused of raping a white woman) had a huge effect on Scout's life.  <br /> <br />I don't want to give away too much of this book, so I believe I will stop there. All I can say is that Harper Lee, a friend of my grandfather, really hit the spot with this one. This has always been and will always continue to be my favorite book of all time. <br />
B0002DKCMG|2.0|What's up with Hollywood and not doing her homework on European culture? I'm Dutch and so tired of hearing 'Dutch' characters in American movies speak German!! <br />In Eurotrip it's even more redicilous. I know the film it's not a serious character study or drama but I don't think that Americans should be fooled so much. For instance, what the hell was that 'stop word' in that S&M scene?? It didn't even look Dutch. And why was their German music in the background?? The Netherlands are DUTCH not German!! And where the hell was that scene situated?? Amsterdam?? That was no Amsterdam. I don't even think that was the Netherlands were they shot that!! And then oddly enough I see a Dutch traffic sign in the 'collage' edit when we enter Berlin. And then flying east from Berlin to Rome?? Since when did Italy move up north/east?? And since when is the San marco bell of the San Marco church in the Vatican Museum? Or actually was it the Saint Peter or maybe some other place?? Cause when our hero Scott finally sees his German girl through the window whe see a reflection of the St. Peter in the window but when he enters the balcony it turns out that that balcony is from the St. peter as the camera zooms out......It was all a bit of confusing for me. <br />I had a few laughs but honestly I think this movie is a waist film industry money. <br />Oh yeah, ....and Europe is not a country!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|Movies can be depressing, exciting, expressive, influential, and the list goes on.  The key as a director is to capture as many of these traits as possible while making a simple modern film.  Some have accomplished feat, however not many.  Mel Gibson, with hard work and descriptive work accomplished when he directed The Passion Of Christ.  The film can be described with countless adjectives, including depressing, motivating, and accurate -to name a few-.  Mel takes you through the last days of what are known to be Jesus Christ's life.  He uses direct interpretations from the Bible, while adding his own opinions on what he believes happened thousands of years ago.  I recommend every person in the world to watch this movie.  Even though at times it can be gruesome and very gory, the theme and idea of the film are the key importance.  Even though half the world may not be Christian this film will definitely broaden the rest of the world's minds'.  Many directors have attempted to recreate the stories of the Bible, and most of them have failed with little or no success.  The Passion Of Christ took modern technology to the limits and excelled by being accepted by the current audience.  This film has taken historical interpretation to a new level.  My only request is that kids under the age of 18 should not be able to see this film.  For one, they will be more likely to understand the meaning behind the film if they are of age.  Second, modern children have been exposed to a great deal of violence; they should witness this film when they are able to distinguish between what is fiction, and what is plausible.
B00005JNEU|3.0|First of all, the book on which this film was based was the best football book that I have ever read.  But, the viewer should realize that the movie is \\"based\\" on the book's story and takes liberties so as to have a climactic finish. <br /> <br />I fully support another reviewer who was troubled by the shaky camera style of filming.  Unfortunately, this seems to be new method of filming football movies since Any Given Sunday.  It's meant to have the viewer \\"feel\\" the emotions of the frantic life of the football player, but it only leads to motion sickness for me, and it makes me doubt the strength of the script that shaking the camera is needed to draw the audience into the scene.   <br /> <br />The acting is generally good, but while the coach's character was central to the film, no attempt was ever made to better understand him.  How, for example, did he really feel about the racist comments made in his presence, and was he as ambivalent about his players outside of their playing abilities as he was portrayed in the film.  Because he is a real person and the film used the coach's real name, it is possible that they did this film without his cooperation and this would be why not more is given to us by the filmmakers.  That's a shame since he is made so important in the film.   <br /> <br />I also would have liked to have known more about the only Mexican-American character in the film since he was obviously a positive figure.  For those wanting more information on the character Boobie check out the Sports Illustrated magazine for October 4th.  In sum, I recommend the film, but not as strongly as I had hoped when anticipating its release.  For those who have not read the book, do so soon, the movie does not give you half of what's in the book. <br />

Even though half the world may not be Christian this film will definitely broaden the rest of the world's minds'.  Many directors have attempted to recreate the stories of the Bible, and most of them have failed with little or no success.  The Passion Of Christ took modern technology to the limits and excelled by being accepted by the current audience.  This film has taken historical interpretation to a new level.  My only request is that kids under the age of 18 should not be able to see this film.  For one, they will be more likely to understand the meaning behind the film if they are of age.  Second, modern children have been exposed to a great deal of violence; they should witness this film when they are able to distinguish between what is fiction, and what is plausible.
B000059Z8J|5.0|The little known actor Christopher Reeve became a household name when this movie, Superman, hit the theaters.  That was about 25 years ago.  We all know of the horse incident, and now... <br /> <br />The story of a boy from the planet Krypton who came to Earth;  given special powers due to a different colored sun in this solar system, that's the story. <br /> <br />There were some great scenes in this film -- the helicopter scene, the love story with Lois Lane;  the dealings with Lex Luthor, and everyone's favorite:  the flying around the world to bring Lois back alive.   <br /> <br />This movie spawned three sequels, of course:  part two featuring three people we met at the beginning of this movie (who were on trial);  part three, which featured my favorite comedian - Richard Pryor, and involved the story of a computer, and some oddball kryptonite which changed Superman;  and then there was part four:  where Superman disposed of the nuclear weapons on the planet, and Lex Luthor returns with his own Superman - made from the DNA in a strand of Superman's hair. <br /> <br />Rest in peace, Christopher Reeve...we'll miss ya.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is, by far, the best movie I've ever seen. I have watched it dozens of times and intend to watch it dozens more.  It tugs at your heart and you find yourself hoping that the prisoners, even though most are guilty of their crimes, find some peace in their lives.  And the ending is super!!  Good for Andy and Red.  (Zihuatenejo is gorgeous!) <br />
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I never thought I'd say this about a Green Day album, but man is this a perfect album.  From start to finish, there isn't a weak moment. Most bands have a hard time producing one great track on an album, let alone twenty-one. <br /> <br />As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the greatest rock album ever created (The Clash's London Calling), it's pretty incredible that Green Day would come up with this politically and socially barbed rock opera. <br /> <br />The great thing about American Idiot is that it can be enjoyed on the surface for being the rocking \\"anthem\\" album that it is.  Or, dig into the lyrics and be amazed at the insight of the group that created \\"Dookie\\". <br /> <br />ebhp
0060512806|5.0|I bought \\"Cryptonomicon\\" after I finished \\"The Diamond Age\\" by the same author.  However, this book sat unread in my to-read pile for more than a year.  After I started it, I wondered aloud why I had waited so long to start it; when I finished it, I flipped back to the first page and began re-reading it.  Although the 900+ pages are daunting to see in your to-read pile, the book is immensely satisfying. <br /> <br />Stephenson crafts a tale of the past and present.  About half of the story takes place before and during World War II; the other half follows the descendants of the characters from the other half in their struggles in the present-day.  Each chapter follows a different character, and the book weaves the chapters from the past and present flawlessly.  We see how characters interact, and can draw parallels between the present characters and their ancestors.  We see how events from the past shape today, in ways both readily apparent and more difficult to ascertain. <br /> <br />Now that I have finished this book, I'm off to dive into his latest series, which I understand has some characters and themes in common with this book.  It certainly has the length in common, but I'm looking forward to another well-crafted story.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This has to be the worst movie I have watched in recent memory. <br /> <br />
B00005JH9W|5.0|Without a doubt the most disturbing and haunting film ever produced as it used real live \\"freaks\\".  Tod Browning instinctively used these individuals for the most horrific effect and it works on many levels.  Even the star who is a \\"short person\\" gives us a few terrible faces which play off his so-called deformity.  Absolutely brillant in effect and has lost none of its impact even though it was produced over 70 years ago and competes with the 21st century's idea of horror.
B00000J7SS|4.0|This is the kind of jazz that really gets under your skin. If any Miles Davis album deserves to be called \\"psychedelic\\", it's this one. It shows Davis at his most progressive, and although sparser than some of his other efforts, Bitches Brew still satisfies. This is a type of project I could see Hendrix doing in his later years had he lived longer. The title really says it all - this is one wicked album.
B000008LOV|5.0|The line up is amazing, the music above average. Furthermore, is a luxury to have together the voices of Roy Orbison, one of my favorites ever, and George Harrison, one of the best and underestimated voices of rock and roll.  <br /> <br />Although relatively unknown in my country, remains timeless in my heart
B00003CX9E|5.0|It amazes me still that CK failed to win best picture in 1941. Well, I guess I am not that amazed, since the Academy has a long tradition of flawed judgement. Scorcese's three greatest movies: Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and GoodFellas, were all snubbed by the academy despite being the best movies of their respective years, but the snubbing of CK certainly deserves attention. Perhaps the academy was simply intimidated by the powerful and petty William Randolph Hearst, the real man who inspired much of the film. Whatever the story is, CK is a must-see for anyone who still believes that film is art.
B000000OA6|5.0|I remember when this album was released, a friend of mine told me he saw a TV special about Queen.  He said that Freddie, in particular, looked very unhealthy in the videos for \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives.\\"  Well, I think we all know what happened to Freddie Mercury just months after this release.  Although he was a fairly private person, the performance and the lyrics are Freddie's most personal.  \\"Innuendo\\" features Steve Howe of Yes on the acoustic middle 8th.  Freddie sings \\"Don't take offence at my innuendo (probably more in reference to his playful side than anything else).  Some people have compared this to the middle 8th in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\"  \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" is a more humourous song, with hilarious lines \\"I think I'm a banana tree\\" and \\"I'm riding only 3 wheels these days, my dear, how about you?\\"  John Deacon closes with a fast bassline.  \\"Headlong\\" is more like the oldschool Queen as is \\"I Can't Live without You,\\" both featuring some great guitar work from Brian May.  \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is a more personal song, warning people to do their best but not kill themselves in the process. \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" is reminiscent of \\"Don't Lose Your Head,\\" with Roger Taylor's fast and furious drums and opening narration \\"Push the envelope, don't sit on the fence!\\"  \\"All God's People\\" sounds a little like \\"Somebody to Love,\\" with its waltzy tempo and Gospel flavour.  \\"Rule with your heart and lead with your conscience,\\" Freddie preaches in the song.  This song also features the operatic harmonies that graced earlier albums like A Night at the Opera.  \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" is a sensitive ballad about growing old with the one you love.  \\"No use wondering what you did when you can sit back and enjoy it through your kids.\\"  \\"Delilah\\" is a humourous song about Freddie's cat and Brian makes cat sounds with his Red Special guitar.  \\"Hitman\\" is almost a heavy metal rewrite of \\"Another One Bites the Dust.\\"  This song isprobably meant to be tongue in cheek, as it seems uncharacteristic with the rest of the album.  Brian plays a lovely romantic solo at the beginning of \\"Bjou\\" (which means \\"sacred jewel\\").  Finally, we come to the closing track, the ultimate farewell song \\"The Show Must Go On.\\"  Freddie probably knew his days were numbered but stayed strong, as you can hear with lyrics \\"Empty places, what are we living for?... I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\\"  Though Queen parted ways after Freddie's untimely death (except for the Concert for Life, the song \\"No One But You\\" and work on the Made In Heaven project), Queen's legacy will go on.
B00005AAFS|5.0|When Rammstein released their third album \\"Mutter\\" (Mother) everyone thought that it would be the last release of the group- that is until they listened to it. When the critics and reviewers put it on they found what was really the bands strongest CD yet. There's a lot less of the techno (except for really cool mixing) and alot more rock in this album. All of the band memebers themselves they were really happy with it- especially Till because he was able to really sing to the songs (and his singing voice is phenomonal). <br /> <br />The opening song \\"Mein Herz Brent\\" (My Heart Burns) is the best opening, starting with strings (REAL strings, not sythesized crap) and Till reciting lines from an old childrens TV show dalled \\"The Sandman\\". It picks up quickly and the music is incredible, and the chorus is beautiful. One of my favorites on the CD. <br /> <br />\\"Links 2,3,4 (Left 2,3,4) Is the biggest hit from the album in america, an army march like song (hence the title). Rammstein uses the word \\"sinister\\" to describe their music quite alot, and indeed I can't think of a better one. <br /> <br />\\"Sonne\\" (Sun): This song is one of the prettiest they have ever done, a song about a boxer that counts \\"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9- OUT!\\" in the background while Till sings. To let you know just how pretty this song is, the music video for it was filmed as the story of Snow White (in a sinister sense, of course). The woman singing in the background is wonderfully mixed in as well. <br /> <br />\\"Ich Will\\" (I want): This song is one that Rammstein wasn't sure they really wanted to right, but is one of their best. Till wrote the lyrics so that he would sing \\"Can you hear me?\\" and the audience would sing back \\"We hear you sing!\\" during live shows. It's brilliant and clever and... again, sinister -_- <br /> <br />\\"Feuer Frei!\\" (Fire at will!) was used in the movie \\"XXX\\" with Vin Disel. This song is so energetic it's great. I could rave to this song forever- in fact most people probably could-so that's most likely why they only made it about three minutes long (which is enough after much injury). I just love whenever they call out \\"Bang! Bang!\\" It's so hard core, great song. <br /> <br />Mutter (Mother): Oddly enough one of the quietest songs on the album follows one of the hardest. It's very sad and pretty, my favorite part is after Till screams out \\"Mutter!\\" and the key changes higher. It's beautiful lyrically as well, the song about a person born from a lab with no parents. Very brooding and emotional. <br /> <br />\\"Spielurh\\" (Musicbox) This is one of THE BEST songs on this CD. It wasn't a single, but I can understand why (they had 5 fromt he album anyway!). The song has a beutiful musicbox part playing in the background of it while Till sings of a child who was no longer wished to live. It's sad and pretty and has a creepy child voice singing with him in the chorus. I love Till's speaking in the beginning and mid-end of the song. He sounds like he's ready a story to children! <br /> <br />\\"Zwitter\\" (Hermaphrodite) This is the most alternative sounding song on the albumn, but that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact it's again, one of the best. It makes you want to dance. It makes you sing along \\"Zwitter Zwitter!\\" The lyrics are so amusing about a complex relationship where he's in love with himself (the character in the song being a Hermaphrodite after all). Brilliantly crafted by the whole band! <br /> <br />\\"Rein Raus\\" (In, Out) THis is a song about having sex. It's one of the hardest on the album, and has this really pretty part in it before the last chorus. MOST HARDCORE. It's natually sung in German, so if you don't want your parents to know what their saying you should be safe... unless your parents are german -_- <br /> <br />\\"Adios\\" The farewell song of the album is surprisingly not the last. This one has the best guitar parts in it (well, solo wise) where they solo turns into the song and goes back into the main riff. It's brilliant and really catchy. Till does a good job singing in this one (as usual). <br /> <br />\\"Nebel\\" (Mist) THis is one of the saddest songs on the albumn, the only other REALY slow one other than \\"Mutter\\". THe story of a man and a dying woman's last kiss, which he can't remember. The melody is really different for them and proves that they can write any kind of music they want- and be successful in doing it. Till's melody line is haunting and pretty, and very heart breaking. He sings with a very raw earnestness and I think I'm ranting a bit here. Anyway, it's good -_- <br /> <br />Yes! So, this is one of the top five albums of all of the hundreds I own. It's incredible and beautiful and altogether proves that Rammstein is still going strong! Get it and you won't be disappointed in the slightest. Everyone's a sucker for beauty- especially in music.
B0006213WG|5.0|I have all the sum 41 albums and I feel that this is by far their best effort to date. Although Does this look infected? will go down as one of my favorite CD's ever I feel this album is a massive improvement on previous efforts. And to everyone who is saying this is typical pop punk, have you even heard this album, I think it's far from it. Now onto the CD. <br /> <br />1.Intro- Just an intro nothing special : 7/10 <br />2.No Reason-Good way to properly kick-start the CD with its mega riffs and immense chorus,probarbly the 2nd best on the cd : 10/10 <br />3.We're all to blame-First single most people have heard it.Very good song : 9/10 <br />4.Angels with dirty faces-Another great song, quite simalar to some songs off does this look infected? : 8/10 <br />5.Some say-This is where sum 41 have changed most, a quite slow song with very meaningfull lyrics : 9/10 <br />6.The bitter end-A very different song coming from sum 41, very fast paced with some kickass solo's : 8/10 <br />7.Open your eyes-My favorite song on the album, some rapping on this song on the verses leading into an amazing chorus, a good solo on this song as well : 10/10 <br />8.Slipping away-Another slow song quite similar to Some Say, they've even used violins at the end of the song : 8/10 <br />9.I'm not the one-Another song with rapping on the verses and cool chorus : 8/10 <br />10.Welcome to hell-Very fast paced song only goes on for less than 2 minutes, probarbly the weakest song on the album : 7/10 <br />11.Pieces-Another slowish song that picks up the pace later on in the song : 8/10 <br />12.There's no solution-Another great song with an immense chorus, another one of my favorites : 9/10 <br />13.88-Starts of loud then goes quiet then goes loud again very good song another one of my favorites : 9/10 <br />14.Noots-Another great song, a good way to end this album : 9/10 <br /> <br />So overall this is a brilliant album that I'm sure will be in my CD player for a very long time. I'd describe it as a mix between Linkin Park, Blink 182, Green Day and Metallica but you can judge that for yourself. Buy it, if you're a fan of sum 41 or rock music in general you probarbly won't regret it.
B000003TA4|5.0|but i love this album. If people like AFI K James don't like it, then just post one review and get over it! no need to keep coming back [what a sad, pathetic thing to do] and try to brainwash people into liking YOUR music...everyone likes what they like for a reason, so face it, they are not going to listen to some twerp like you tell them what's good and what is not. [just a little FYI - i love the fabulous 4 grunge bands for equally different reasons....sure Nirvana didn't have the guitar chops that say, Soundgarden had, but what they had was true passion and soulful lyrics which i would take over a testostrone-fueled solo any day..] If your a sad, middle-aged hair metal thrasher you most likely will not like this album and are still moaning about how it killed off your genre [*sob*sob* how horribly tragic that was...]all in all...it may have been their most \\"teenager-ish\\" album, but it is still a classic. You can still listen to it today and marvel at how unstale it sounds...this is timeless music.     FootNote: before someone gets me on it, i'd just like to say that i did not intend to imply that Soundgarden was a \\"testostrone fueled\\" band...[sorry Kim!] I really do love them. so just thought i'd clarify that.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I had never been a huge fan of Madonna, but after seeing the video of \\"Material Girl\\" on MTV, I have become full-throttle with her vibes. The refreshing sounds of \\"Ray of Light\\" cannot touch the guitar and ultra-techno rythms of \\"American Life.\\" <br /> <br />The melodramatic/punk lyrics of the title song and even it's video (well-worth watching for on MTV) are a slyly symbolic reference to finding a place in the chaotic mass we call the US of A. <br />From the soft trajedy of 'Hollywood' is a blunt statement made from a star who's definitely speaking from her heart, as is clearly implied in her lyrics. My top song is the light techno-ballad 'Love Profusion' which describes a type of hopelessness about life, direction, and true absolutes in the world.  <br /> <br />Madonna has been referred to harshly for years by critics, as a leader in controversy and musical innovation, but I can both truly appreciate and empathize with her journey through stardom and rejection, as will other listeners. Although Madonna has only won a Grammy for best music video  (\\"Music\\"), she unarguably deserves ten times the recognition for her persistent effort. <br /> <br />The buyer of this album will come to fully realize that her reference to American culture as an illusion, is a true artistic gesture. If anything, the smash-success 'Die Another Day' will definitely make for some serious driving music.  <br />In the professional opinion of this fan, Madonna's music will not disappoint the listener, and leave lasting impressions. Plug it in and give it a whirl, <br /> <br />Heard it, Loved it, bought it, still loved it, <br />--GIGI <br /> <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|When i heard that The Mars Volta consisted of Cedric and Omar from At the Drive-In, i was anxious to hear the sound they prodiced with their side project.  When I heard this album, i was completely and utterly blown away by it's creativeness, how imaginative it was, it's unique sound, and the story it tells.  The album itself is actually the story of a friend who is in a coma from a suicide attempt and his experiences there, according to the band.  Omar Rodriguez, the guitarist is absolutely amazing and his skills are displayed perfectly on the album.  Cedric, the vocalist soars into new depths and sounds, in contrastr to his voice from At the Drive-In.  This is one of the greatest cds I have ever heard, and is a modern day classic.  You definately need to get this cd.
B0006213WG|5.0|This album is great, my friend downloaded the whole thing and it came with extra tracks. It says that there are Bonus Tracks: <br />14 - Noots <br />15 - Moron <br />16 - Subject to Change <br /> <br />I was just wondering if these tracks are on the official CD that you could buy in stores. Thanks a lot.
B00003CX5P|5.0|For true Star wars fans this movie is a dream. People shouldn't jugde it as a sole movie. It's just a small part of a six part story. For a Star Wars fan's the story is great, the f/x are amazing and it makes me love star wars even more then I ever have before. I've been a fan for 15 years and my love for star wars has never been stronger.
B00000K0E5|5.0|How they could take sexy Sean Bean put him in a Bond flick as 006 and have a boring movie, I have no idea.  But they did.  It's not that back, but the film is just so forgettable.  I have watched this several times, giving it every chance. <br /> <br />It's still forgettable.
1400049628|2.0|I checked this book out from the library, (the rating would have been lower if I had bought it) and I was disappointed.  Even on the book jacket it is listed as a \\"humor\\" book, but it is not even remotely funny.  Some people claim it is a parody, but even as a parody I don't find this funny.  It seems to me like the author is trying way too hard to create something that isn't meant to be taken seriously.  Even for lovers of zombie films, this book is too verbose and isn't worth shelling out the dough for.
B0006213WG|4.0|I jut picked this album up an hour ago. And it is good so far. Haven't listened to it. Just kind of skimmed it. But it was cool. How dare people label these guys pop-punk. They play fast, loud, and heavy. If you like sum 41 you will like this.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Do these guys every stop getting better? I've been a Dream Theater fan since I heard \\"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory.\\" This band is utterly amazing. The technical brilliance of this band is not of this world. The sheer power and beauty of their music lies within the hands and hearts of four memebers: Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci, John Myung, and Jordan Rudess. James LaBrie's singing, in my opinion, is just a diversion. NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE WHO LIKES JAMES!!!! I like his singing, but I think he's there to satisfy those fans who believe you must have vocals in the music for it to be music. Oh, how stupid people are.....just kidding!<br /><br />Anyway, on with the review of this concert DVD. This DVD absolutely smokes!!!! From start to finish, this DVD is jaw-dropping. I think the whole concert is very well done and put together. The audio and video are tight. Very crisp picture and audio. Good seperation of the instruments, which I'm very happy about.<br /><br />The content of this DVD are also something that any DT fan should get excited about. One true highlight for me was the \\"Instrumedley,\\" which absolutely blew me away. Dream Theater are probably one of the best bands I've ever heard. I mean I rank them up there with other progressive giants like Genesis, Yes, and King Crimson. These guys can pull out all the stops in the studio and live. They are a fantastic live band.<br /><br />The bonus material is also worth watching. There is a very cool documentary of the band on tour in Japan. John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, and Jordan Rudess take us into their worlds and show their equipment setup. There's also an interesting video history of the band that takes us back to the beginning where it all began!<br /><br />This DVD is inspiring and at the same time makes me realize that these musicians are some of the best in the world and anyone who don't know who they are need to pick this DVD up.
B000002AVF|5.0|Maybe I'm a bit biased because #1 I'm a MASSIVE Mariah fan and #2 I happened to get this CD at a rather low point in my life in 1995, and it was so uplifting for me, but I'm sure you'll agree this album is Mariah at her best. Recorded at the height of her soaring career, Mariah played with different music styles, and she gave us a taste of what was to come in future releases (e.g. \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\") with her first foray into serious R'n'B/Hip-Hop. Once again her amazing lyrics (which have an uncanny way of reflecting experiences and feelings of my own) shine and THAT voice soars throughout most of the songs (unfortunately not something that happens so much on her more recent albums.) <br /> <br />1. Fantasy - 10/10 - Sensational musically, lyrically and vocally. Upbeat, funky and a bit different to what were used to from Mariah, which makes this track all-the-more fantastic. The famous ODB remix rocks as well (lucky me was treated to the live version in Perth 1998!!) <br /> <br />2. Under The Stars - 8/10 - I used to think this song was rather boring but I absolutely love it now! Sounding like it could very well have been released in 1978 (which is probably one of the reasons I love it so much), UTS is smooth and sexy. <br /> <br />3. One Sweet Day - 9/10 - I guess it helped that both Mariah and the 'Boyz' were enjoying their own massive successes in 1995, but I'm sure that if this song was released in any other year, it still would have been the world-wide record-breaking smash it was then. What an amazing collaboration! - so powerful, moving and passionate. I especially love the A-Cappella version on the CD single (if you're lucky enough to have a copy - be sure to have a listen!) <br /> <br />4. Open Arms - 8/10 - I hadn't heard the original Journey version of this track prior to Mariah's (I have since rectified this music faux-pas) - and both are beautiful in their own right. Where Journey's version is passionate, Mariah's is sweet and heartfelt. As with this track, even on the softer, slower songs, Mariah's voice truly SOARS (something she does less and less of these days, unfortunately) <br /> <br />5. Always Be My Baby - 9/10 - Funky, groovy track with cute lyrics and Mariah's voice sounds amazing. I can't help but have to get up and sing along (although I can't sing!!) <br /> <br />6. I Am Free - 8/10 - I gained a whole new respect for this song at Mariah's '98 concert in Perth - she read out a letter from a member of the audience who'd recently lost her best friend (also a Mariah fan) to cancer and mentioned that this was their favourite song and was played at her funeral (Mariah then sang One Sweet Day for her.) I couldn't have thought of a song more fitting. This gospel-like song is truly uplifting and beautiful. <br /> <br />7. When I Saw You - 9.5/10 - simply beautiful lyrically, vocally and musically, this is one of my very favourite Mariah ballads. Her voice is simply amazing.  <br /> <br />8. Long Ago - 8/10 - I wasn't a huge fan of this track at first, but it's definately grown on me over the years. Especially when it later described a situation with an ex! I also love the groovy beat...a great mellowish song. <br /> <br />9. Melt Away - 7.5/10 - as with \\"Long Ago\\", I didn't like this track so much for the first year or two I had this album. But it really is beautiful - quite sensual. Quite obvious that BabyFace co-wrote and produced, though! His style is easy to pick out! <br /> <br />10. Forever - 8/10 - this was one of my favourite songs when I first purchased the CD, but where some of my lesser favourites have grown on me, this one doesn't do the same for me that it used to. However, I do love how she played with the 50's/60's ballad sound (and simplicity of lyrics)and her vocals are spectacular throughout! <br /> <br />11. Daydream (Interlude) - 7/10 - not ODB's remix, nor the Def Club mix (an 11-odd minute remix which completely rocks - crank it up if you have the Fantasy CD single!), but not too shabby. <br /> <br />12. Looking In - 7.5/10 - musically, this track is stirringly beautiful.  <br /> <br />As always, Mariah's lyrics are powerful and moving. Musically, this album is stunning - particularly the ballads, where Mariah collaborates with the amazing Walter Afanasieff - If there was an instrumental version of this album, i'd have it! And as mentioned over and over, Mariah's voice doesn't let up at all. Daydream is definitely one of my favourite Mariah Carey albums! No true Mariah fan should live without it!!!
B00006CXXU|4.0|\\"I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better, Meet the real me,\\" Christina says on the first track of her album, Stripped Pt. 1. Christina is finally moving up from pop star status, with the release of her latest C.D, entitled Stripped. By \\"Stripped\\" she doesn't mean naked, she's referring to the real Christina Aguilera, or as she's more formerly known, X-Tina. When Christina's music first came out she was a pop icon and didn't portray her true self. With the debut of this album everyone can have a peak inside the real life of \\"X-Tina.\\" <br /> Christina's life has changed drastically since her fist self titled album, \\"Christina Aguilera\\", came out. In her earlier days she was this sweet, young blond girl who was once a member of Disney's, Mickey Mouse Club. Her music mostly consisted of love ballads and up-beat dance songs, most of them written by someone other than herself. Not only was her music different than it is now, but also her entire look. She had cute, short, bleached blond hair and wore midriff baring tops and super tight bottoms. Today you can find her with the same type of outfits, but showing a lot more skin than before and her pants have gotten tighter and lower. Also her hairstyles are way more exotic than before. Not only is her hair color constantly changing, but so is the style. This is what makes her so unique. She has a style unlike any other.  <br /> Behind those short skirts and tight tops comes an amazing voice. Christina has a wonderful talent and can reach even the highest notes. If you were not a big fan of her last C.D, give her another chance. This C.D is very different from her first. She writes about real happenings in her life, including her abusive father on the track \\"I'm OK.\\" She also does a wonderful job on the anthem \\"Beautiful,\\" a deep song about how every ones beautiful in their own way. One of my favorite songs from this C.D would be \\"Walk Away.\\" It's a love song that is so beautiful and touching and the lyrics are amazing and very well written. Another song I would recommend listening to is \\"Can't hold us down\\" featuring Lil Kim. There's a part where she sings, \\"This is for my girls all around the world, who've come across a man who don't respect your worth, thinking all women should be seen, not heard.\\" Basically, she's singing about double standards for men and women. How men get away with certain actions and behaviors, but if a woman was to do the same thing it's unacceptable. I think many women can relate to not only this song, but also the others. To me, the C.D \\"Stripped\\" is a womans anthem. No matter what mood I am in I can always find a song to relate to and that is important to me in picking out a great C.D. <br /> One drawback of this C.D would be the tracks \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Get Mine Get Yours.\\" As you can probably tell from the titles of these two songs, they are very mature and have a lot of sexual content. Although they are catchy, if you have younger children you probably would not want them listening to these songs. Don't get me wrong, they are nice if you just want to dace, but if you're looking for a song to actually listen and relate to then I wouldn't recommend these two songs. <br /> Overall I loved how Christina completely opened up and let us explore her life as she sees it. Her songs are really inspiring and the way she sings and presents them is great. Some people have bad opinions of her because of how she has changed, but I admire her for this. It's a hard thing to do, finding your true self, and she did it. If she's comfortable and happy this way then who are we to criticize her? I love her and her music and I can't wait for her next C.D to come out. Her music has inspired me and helped me through some rough times. Keep up the good work Christina! <br />
B000002MP2|5.0|The very standout songs on this album are, Welcome to paradise and She. They are the hits but every song on here is great, they are all definately worth listening to. In my opinion out of every band in the world this drummer is the best drummer ever. and expresses his full talent on this album. if you are a drummer, buy this album. if you not a drummer, BUY THIS ALBUM! Even the hidden track on F.O.D is great, most hidden tracks are like D-Side material. This music is also great for people like me with short attention spans, every song (except for F.O.D because it has the hidden track) is under 4 minutes. The cover art and inlet kept me entertained for a while. It was like one of those where's wally books. The best songs on this album are found on Shenanigans (a great compilation). If you like blink-182 listen to this they're like blink, except better.
B0002CTSVS|1.0|Like its source book, this movie is kitsch and schmaltz, the coarse and the crass - cloaked in imitation profundity.<br />The Jesus figure is a man-made symbol of fatherly-brotherly altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. This myth is utilised to feed a mental loop of unfulfilled yearnings, guilt and shame.  So the movie is built on self-referring, primitive, goat-herder stories, wilfully mistaken for something meaningful.<br />The movie's source book of primitive stories depicts fantasy figures called `Jesus' and `God' - invented by humans many centuries ago. It is purely and solely the drives of human culture and the products of neurological phenomena and obsessive thought-loops that produced the Bible. `God' is the product of neurological quirk, fused with ego-driven cultural obsession.<br />To believe the movie's source book as the word of `God' is merely to fail to recognise its solely human sources: emotional, neurological, cognitive, cultural, sociological. Man's habitual self-deception and delusional, repetitive thought patterns generate religious belief. If a baby's fixation on the all-powerful, all-providing, all-knowing parent figure becomes mentally fixed - the result is rigid, fixated Christ and God-belief in adulthood.<br />So given both its ancient and contemporary creative sources, it is no surprise then that this is a gaudy movie - a blunt instrument - lacking finesse and subtly. It is makes crude appeal to crude emotions and is vulgar in its execution.<br />The Bible is bogus, spurious, and a garish concoction: a crude, blunt, vulgar appeal to amorphous concepts and broad-brush emotions and desires. For example: fear of death, the feeling of being lost and needing rescue, the psyche's desire for immortality, hunger for an upwardly directed relationship.<br />Longings that merely end up as self-comfort mind-loops.<br />If only this movie had been ignored - but it is just too difficult for people to break out of the neurological quirk that is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is. The movie is merely a contemporary manifestation of a relentless tradition of self-deception and delusion - of Bible-swill and God mush - and the desire to spread the mind washing cult-virus that is Christianity.<br />Someone called `Jesus' might or might not have existed but - manifestly - he was not the `Son of God'. As such, this movie's core claim of `the Christ' is bogus and spurious.<br />Humans wish to make sense of suffering. For some, `the Christ' on the Cross is a culturally potent man-made symbol of altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. Constructs of sin, fallen man etc all illustrate that Christianity is merely a fabricated construct employed by humankind/people to:<br />- understand their own suffering<br />- come to terms with their own suffering<br />- justify suffering by the person(s) experiencing it<br />- justify suffering by the person(s) inflicting it<br />If all of humankind were extinguished, so would 'Jesus' and 'God' - since this is their sole locus of existence. Truly it is manifest to all that: on the 7th day, man created God in his own image.<br />Chances are that people who dislike this review will promptly generate ever more fierce and tight circles of belief thought-loops in order to dismiss it.<br />At the foot of the end credits, we are accurately and truthfully informed that:<br />&quot;Characters and events portrayed in this motion picture are fictitious.&quot;is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is.

B000000WA4|5.0|Everything on this disk is great. From the sort of classicalish \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness. (the song)\\" to the distorted \\"Tales of a scorched earth.\\". If you like bands like Green Day and Nirvana then you'll probably like this. The lyrics are truely excellent, like, real poetry. My favourite songs on this were f*** you (an ode to no-one), bullet with butterfly wings, zero, we only come out at night and where the boys fear to tread.\\". If you hate nasal vocalists then just don't buy this, the vocalist is one of the most nasal people i've ever heard. Sometimes it gets annoying. the songs, i believe that weren't on the greatest hits are some of the best. buy this instead of the greatest hits.
B00008NG5V|4.0|If you like to listen to a more relaxed and mellow type of music, then Jack Johnson is the person for you.  His type of music falls into the alternative genre, but it also has folk sound to it.  This type of music and these lyrics will put you in a relaxed mood, and help relieve all your stress from a hard day.   <br /> Jack Johnson's CD Brushfire Fairytales is the first CD he has out, the second being On and On.  Unlike some artists, who's CDs both have a different sound to them; Jack Johnson's two CDs have relatively the same type of sound to them.  They both have a laid-back, mellow feel to them; his second CD having more of a smoother feel to it.  The majority of his songs on this CD are slower and more low-key feel, but there are a few songs on the CD that have a more upbeat feeling to them.  Many of his songs are more of an acoustic ballad, but once in awhile he will throw in an upbeat song, like \\"Bubble Toes\\", which is one of his more famous songs, along with \\"Flake\\".  All of his songs though have a laid-back feel to it, that makes it easy to listen to if you are trying to relax, or if you are trying to concentrate on something; its not like other types of music that has so much going on in one song that you cant think. <br /> If you listen to the lyrics of his music, some of them have weird rhymes and crazy metaphors to them.  But some of his songs are about important issues.  One of his songs, \\"In the News\\", talks about the News and why people never feel sad for events that happen in the news.  \\"A billion people died on the news tonight, but not so many cried at the terrible sight\\" starts out the beginning of this song.  I think it means that we watch what happens in the news, but we don't really don't do anything about it.  <br /> Another song, \\"Posters\\", talks about how we view ourselves, and how we never feel content with ourselves.  The song starts out by saying \\"Looking at himself but wishing he was someone else. Because the posters on the wall they don't look like him at all\\".  I think he writes about this because people in the world look at pictures of other people and are never satisfied with who we are.  <br /> One more song, \\"Its All Understood\\", talks about how society tends to spread rumors and gossip around, even thought it may not be true.  \\"Everyone knows  what went down because the news was spread all over town.  And fact is only what you believe.  And fact and fiction work as a team\\".  His songs, especially the three above, are all about issues we can relate to about how we view society, ourselves, and even others around us.   <br /> Overall, On and On is a great CD to listen to if you need to relax yourself, and have a good time.  I enjoy listening to this CD when I am stressed out or if I am working on something.  I can concentrate even when I'm listening to this CD because it is laid back and an easy listen.  If I am working on something important, it makes the time fly by, and I always feel better after listening to this CD.  Even though some of the songs sound the same and are a little repetitive, I never get bored of listening to this CD.  You will not be let down if you buy this CD. <br />
B0001DI0FI|5.0|If you are looking for a movie to make you think while still providing a riveting story line, you've found it.  This movie will bring you right into the actual life aboard a British vessel of war during the Napoleonic wars.  If however you simply want to be \\"a-mused\\" (literally translated \\"no thought\\") then you will probably be disappointed.  If ALL you expect to see is bullets, sabers, cannonballs and blood, don't waste your money -- you won't get it (the movie).  (BTW, there is some of all that.) I loved this movie because there were no \\"bad\\" people that in most movies always seem to spoil everything.  I loved the movie because the ending left you in suspense.  I loved this movie because the interaction between characters was well-done (I never read the book-s so was not predjudiced by a more lengthy character development possible in printed form).  I highly recommend this movie.
0440241413|4.0|If you love to shop and you love fashion, then you will definitely love this book, Confessions of a Shopaholic.  This book is a hilarious story of a single woman living in England, who is trying to get herself out of the financial mess she got herself into from shopping.  The worst part is she is a financial advisor for a local magazine. <br />Becky Bloomwood lives in a well known apartment complex in England with her best friend Suzy.  She writes for a financial magazine, giving information on how to use smart banking, and saving your money well.  She doesn't even like her job, and she is always finding ways to get out of press conferences, and writing the articles. <br />  Becky could take some advice from her job on financing though, because Becky herself has a hard time managing her money.  She is a shopaholic; spending her money whenever she can, and even sometimes when she can't.  Her credit cards are maxed out, and she has no more money left, but somehow she finds the money to buy that beautiful sweater in the department store window.  The bills are always pilling up in her mailbox, but she manages to find new ways to get rid of the bills.  She \\"accidentally\\" looses them, throws them out without looking at them, or hides them, because she doesn't want to know how much of a debt she is in.  She knows that she has a trouble spending money, and even tries to make herself a budget to manage her money better.  But Becky cannot fight the urge to shop when there is a sale, and sometimes is a foolish spender, buying things she doesn't need and will never use.   <br />Soon, she meets a man, Luke Brandon, from a highly successful financial company, and soon realizes that she likes him.  Then she finds out some important information about his company, that not only saves her financial situation, it changes her life, and saves Luke's company. <br />The author of this book, Sophie Kinsella, is the author of 3 different books.  She has written 2 other books in the series of the Shopaholic, Shopaholic Takes Manhattan, and Shopaholic Ties the Knot.  Both of these books go on the same adventures with Becky on spending her money and her job, but she also goes on newer adventures, traveling to America, and even meeting someone of her dreams.  Sophie has also written another book called Can You Keep a Secret? that stars a totally different character.  Sophie is now a writer, but like Becky, she used to be a journalist for a financial magazine also.   <br />This is a great book only if you are looking for a light summer read.  It's a book you would enjoy to read if you were just relaxing.  It doesn't require much thinking about what is going on in the book, because it is easy to follow what the plot is.  Also, this is not the kind of book you would read to go into big depth.  It's just an easy, fun book to read.  It is about fashion and shopping, rather than any other serious subject.  But the book is hilarious, that will keep you laughing, and wondering why and how she does the things she does.   Her hilarious acts keep the book going and you will find yourself waiting to see how she gets out of the messes she gets herself into.  I personally enjoyed this book because of I was just looking for an easy read over the summer too.  I liked how Becky always got herself into those hilarious messes.  She does some crazy things that I would never think to do, and she does it all just to get out of paying a bill, something we all have to do in our lives.  I would recommend reading this book, but just for something to sit back and relax to, and also to laugh about. <br />
B00005JMCW|5.0|This movie is a really great family film!  I was surprised at how well Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis worked together.  The chemistry between them really made the movie...and of course the line \\"I look like the Cryptkeeper!\\" is an instant classic!  A definite must-see!
B00005JMX6|5.0|Definitely an outstanding comedy, The Girl Next Door, brings to the screen exactly what the title indicates: the story of a high school senior who meets and falls madly in love with his next door neighbor, who happens to be a porn star! <br />Emile Hirsch, Elisha Cuthbert, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.  The Girl Next Door is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's (young and adult alike) every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.   <br />In short, the Girl Next Door is a movie definitely worth watching! <br />
B0001I561E|4.0|Aladdin has a little bit of everything....a princess....a charming lower-class man...a funny genie....an evil villain...and a right comedic little parrot.  This is the next to last great Disney animated film (just before THE LION KING) before political correctness and fear settled into the Disney corporation.  The color and animation are vividly done, the music is outstanding, and who could forget the timeless classic by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson, \\"A Whole New World\\".  Yes, this is definitely a modern classic...right next to SNOW WHITE, SLEEPING BEAUTY, FOX AND THE HOUND, and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.
B0002MB7QW|4.0|ok seeing the previews of this I was expecting massive destructive movie with lots of action and chaos. Amazingly enough, theres only a few scenes of that in this movie. no joke, 80% of this movie is about a father trying to reach his son in frozen NY and his son trying to win a girlfriend over. Actually, I just realized, this movie resembles Titanic so much. The only problem with that is that it should of shown more destruction and not have most of the focus in the United States. We see Los Angeles destroyed (yet everyone runs south towards the tornados) and NY covered in water then frozen. Was Canada completely lost? What about Europe or any place else? Yeah I know in Independance Day they didn't show too much other nations getting destroyed but lets see the Effiel Tower summerged or something. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but it wasn't exactly what I expected, it is worth a watch though.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Like him or not, Michael Moore makes people get out there and think with his documentary about the War on Terror-F 9/11.  I believe this movie to be an important one, no matter what side of the fence you stand on, just because it is forcing the American public to take a long, hard look at some issues that people do not necessarily want to face.  One thing a documentary should do is make you think about things, and investigate the issues for yourself.  Whether Mr. Moore is lying or not, if he presents \\"facts\\", and someone disagrees, they should go out and do research to refute the \\"facts\\", not just rant and rave about how BAD the movie is!  You have to give kudos to Michael Moore for getting out there and putting the issues in our face.  Whether or not you buy into what he is saying, this movie is quite interesting and worth the money.  Watch the film...and judge it for yourself....
B0000CABBW|5.0|I had never seen this movie until recently, because it never really looked interesting to me, you know, just a girl, and some whales, etc.  Now that I have seen it, all I could think was, WOW!  Beautifully acted and wonderfully shot and directed, \\"Whale Rider\\" is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It's a great story about one little girl and her mission to prove her patrilineal culture wrong by trying to prove herself as the next leader.  I strongly suggest this film for anyone, all ages, all cultures, just anyone who likes a great story that is filled with heart and soul.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Just about anything by Quentin Tarantino is bound to be interesting. This is a cross between \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but not as good as either. I couldn't give it five stars because it wasn't creative enough. It just didn't grab me. The soundtrack was great, as usual. The acting was pretty good. It just seemed too much like other movies that have been out recently (hint: too much like \\"The Matrix\\"). Still, recommended and I will watch the sequel.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I went into this movie thinking I'd get a few laughs but I almost wet myself in the first 10 minutes. If you like stupid humor along the lines of Tommy Boy and Happy Gilmore, then this movie is right up there. If you're looking for clever humor, it's probably not going to satisfy you.
B000002LVB|5.0|This Velvet Underground album is just plain awesome.  Oh sweet nuthing is possibly my favorite close for an album.  Every song is perfectly placed on this album.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Even though it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Moore is not only a fantastic film maker, but an excellent researcher, don't take my word for it.  Watch and make your own opinion, but don't comment w/o seeing it first.  It's plain to see from some negative views below, most who criticize it have not.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Love him or hate him Michael Moore really puts it all out there in this film. But one must watch it with an open and honest mind to grasp its true value to America. <br /> <br />After months of anticipation and media hype (most of it bad) I couldn't wait to watch this DVD. I will say that one should watch this film after having formed their own opinion because I imagine it has the ability to make up the mind of the entirely clueless. Moore portrays President Bush as an arrogant bumbling idiot without one good quality. Personally I don't believe that to be so but I also have a healthy perspective on where his administration has erred America as well. Every one can be filmed during their worst moments and made to look foolish so the scenes filmed by Moore about President Bush didn't impress me. I don't believe ANYONE could have known how to react on 9/11 and not look foolish, we all paid a price on that day that shouldn't be mocked, it is history and that day will never be changed it is only our futures that stand a chance. I believe this film will force you to get involved, to take a stand and to care how America is represented, the fog has been lifted and now we are all responsible. <br /> <br />This film does not get interesting, unless you like to \\"Bushbash,\\" until the Iraq war comes into play. We see children playing on swing sets and women going to market, Iraqi smiles and laughter and then BOOM! For people who have chosen to watch the war only through the eyes of our popular media this film will open your eyes to a truth really too horrible for any of us to imagine. Moore manages to show the devastation that Iraq has felt because of American decisions. Their blood drips on each and every one of us especially our precious soldiers. It is important to realize here that the poor and uneducated are fighting the same. An effective moment in this film is when Moore attempts to recruit the children of American congressmen for service in Iraq.....and the answer is? Asfor our soldiers they are trained to kill, asked to kill and faced with death every day something unfathomable to imagine dealing with. Moore presents the difficulties that our soldiers face in Iraq as well as the abuses that Iraqis are suffering. The footage is not easy to get through without feeling touched and often ashamed. Watching a mother read a letter from her son killed in battle is almost impossible to endure but we must in order for it all to change. Regardless of your political beliefs allow this film to affect you! <br /> <br />This DVD has many very interesting \\"extras\\" that further the horror of what is taking place before the world's eyes in Iraq. But what can be done? Moore is doing something, taking a stand is doing something, developing compassion is doing something and asking questions is doing something. The only bad question is the one not asked! Moore asks and even answers many questions with this extraordinary film. The fact that it was accepted so well internationally must mean something. Like it or not being a proud American doesn't just stop at our own borders, our pride exists in the universe as well and maybe after watching this film that fact will matter. Allow your temperature to rise with knowledge and compassion and realize that the answer cannot and must not be found in hate. <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I have enjoyed Michael Moore's work in the past - Bowling for Columbine was particularly brilliant.  His most recent film was educational to me - I hadn't realized it was the President's cousin at Fox News who originally called Florida for Bush in 2000.  No matter what your political perspective, this is a fascinating film.  I highly recommend it!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Exellent movie(s: I and II). Quentin rules! If you havent watched these movies then do watch them. Not recommended for violence disliking audiences
B00003CXCT|1.0|Does George Lucas have the right to add silly, out of place, crude-looking special effects to these movies decades after their initial release? I guess he does, because here they are.  <br /> <br />If da Vinci had gone back to the Mona Lisa years later and painted a mustache on her, would it still be a work of art? I guess it would, but it would not be the Mona Lisa anymore. So these DVDs may be works of art and may still be worth watching, but to label them \\"Star Wars\\" is nothing short of a lie. <br /> <br />You could buy these DVDs today, or you could wait (maybe forever) for ol' Georgie to release the original versions of the movies on DVD. Personally, I'd rather watch a faded, grainy VHS copy of the real movies for now. Eventually the real versions of these movies will be released on DVD; if there's money to be made in doing it (and there is) it will be done. <br /> <br />Stay away for now. <br />
B00005S6K8|5.0|Before seeing the re-make of this movie I saw the original Sabrina and found it to be very good (but, I think all of Audrey Hepburn's movies are). I love both of the Sabrina movies and I seriously doubt I could choose one over the other. Ford and Ormond both act wonderfully in this re-make. I usually seldmon re-watch movies but, after seeing this one in only 1 week I've seen it 3 times
B000002KIE|4.0|I love Anarchy in the UK. It is an anthem for the angry. I just don't get the whole best of punk reviews. Don't get me wrong, they have some great songs for the short amount of time they were out. I don't know if anyone has said this in a review of the Sex Pistols but this is their only real studio album. The others are thrown together messes. I love EMI, Anarchy in the UK and like the rest on this disc. My favorite song by them is not on this, Friggin in the Riggin. I hate to do this but maybe check out the hits disc, it has all of these or at least all of the songs on this worth listening to and has Friggin in the Riggin.
6305428042|5.0|I went to go see Hocus Pocus when it first came into theatres and I enjoy it more each time I watch it!  Who in God's name says this movie is horrible??? It's halarious!  Bette Midler is supurb as Winnie! And everyone else in this film is great as well!  I honestly don't know one person who saw this film and didn't love it!  So give it a try!  It will not dissapoint!
B0001WTUH6|2.0|Before one can properly criticize Underworld, one needs to excise the elements lifted whole cloth from \\"The Matrix:\\"<br /><br />01. Leather/Urban Chic costumes<br />02. Lighting design<br />03. Characters reflected in other character's sunglasses<br />04. Comic book \\"look down\\" shots<br />05. Bullet Time effects<br />06. Muted Color Scheme<br />07.

Character: Selene (IS Trinity)<br /><br />I think basically Len Wiseman (director) saw the Matrix, phoned some film executives and said: \\"let's take the most original SF movie in years and remake it, this time with Vampires and Werewolves.\\"<br /><br />Now that we have gotten that out of the way, we can critique what's left of \\"Underworld.\\"<br /><br />The Mythology.<br /><br />Nice job here.

The extended cut really expanded on this.<br /><br />The Visual Ideas<br /><br />Aren't we all sick to death of Vampires being tragic, doom-obsessed goths? Puts the 'ring back in BORING. For a spectacular re-imagining of the genre, rent the British miniseries \\"Ultraviolet.\\" It's the best thing to happen to Vampires since, well, immortality.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />They actually did a nice job of trying to keep it fairly believable. I have to give credit here. It seems that since so many of the other elements had already been developed (and previously filmed) they had time to really sit down and hash out the story. Kudos.<br /><br />The Performances<br /><br />Trinity vs. Selene<br /><br />The very quality that Carrie-Ann Moss gave Trinity is what Kate Beckinsale did NOT give Selene. There is a vulnerability and a sense of things going on behind the eyes with Trinity that makes her an intriguing character rather than the mindless video-game killing machine that is Selene. There is nothing interesting about Selene; she's is one note affair from beginning to end. There were rumors that Beckinsale spurned some convention fans by saying of Undwerworld: 'it's only a bloody comic book.' Well, if that's the extent of the thought she put behind Selene, it really shows.<br /><br />The supporting cast were stellar. Michael Sheen as the lycan leader and Shane Brolly as the vampire leader were very good.

B0000067L2|4.0|While Eric Clapton gained enormous fame as a monster guitarist in the '60s with his band Cream, it was not readily acknowledged that what he was doing was nothing radically new. Granted, Clapton had a solo style that was both bursting with power and possessed a strange lovliness; however guitarists had been achieving this particular combination for some time. What Clapton did was to crank the volume way, way up so that the ensuing frenzy really did sound like the heavens were exploding. <br /> But that's not to take away from the album's essential listenability, even if its originality is suspect. While Clapton was not destined to be the pathbreaker than Hendrix, and to a somewhat smaller extent John McLaughlin was, he had more than achieved, by the time he was in his 20s what most other musicians would never do even if they lived to be 90.  <br /> And we must not forget Baker and Bruce's contributions. The propulsive force of Baker's drum solos were as much a definition of Cream as Clapton's fire was. While guitarists of Clapton's caliber can be encountered now and again in the rock world, Baker had almost no rival--not until the emergence of jazz-rock, when Billy Cobham's harder and more \\"masculine\\" style, one with an emphasis on outrageous power and a more cerebral approach, would set the standard.  <br /> As for the album itself,its a good one, but like I said before,its good less for what it is than what it helps us understand. In that sense its more musicology than music.Still, its a great listen
0880389052|5.0|I think this book is a great beginning to the story of Drizzt. As for reviewers like Zach who like to think they are smart and enjoy using big words to somehow validate their oppinion, I would say that you think too much and your over-analysis is unfounded and inaccurate.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I have been listening to the Ramones since I was 5 years old, 1979. I have never tired of them. It's not about obvious talent. If I want talent, I will listen to Tool or so many of the other great bands that I do listen to but when I want something fun and simple this is it. I do consider myself a fan of punk. Even though most of my cds are metal. The Ramones shouldn't be put in the punk genre because there is so much more to them then the Sex Pistols. I will say that I think this cd started punk. I don't get a punk feel from any of the Stooges releases or even the MC5. This is what I need when I want to have fun and be silly. I would even tell parents to buy this for your kids who want the newest Good Charlotte. I find as much, \\"talent\\" in this cd as I do any that I own because I never skip a song. That to me is talent not how well they can sing or play their guitars. Give it a try and you will be singing a medley of the songs all day. Very catchy and as good as anything on this site.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|What do you expect when you hear that Cline Dion & Anne Geddes are going to work together? Well I expected much but I got more. This project is very beautiful Anne's pictures with and without Cline are absolutly stunning. But then what we here for the cd. I have always been a huge fan of Cline and this makes me an even bigger fan I respect her so much that after all she has done she knows to come up with something new. <br />This album is beautiful, it's one of the albums where the voice is bigger than any instrument it is the instrument. The genre of the album is maby not my most favorit they are lullabies with some exception of songs who can be on just any Cline album.

B000063DHL|5.0|Iron Maiden's golden age started with \\"Killers\\" and pretty much ended with \\"Somewhere in Time\\". All of the songs on \\"Somewhere\\" are ambitious, adding new elements to Maiden's sound. The guitar synth's found on \\"Somewhere\\" are present, but not as overpowering as on the follow-up cd \\"Seventh Son\\". Everything Maiden fans enjoy about the band are present on \\"Somewhere\\". Steve Harris' bass lines crackle, and Dickinson's urgent vocals really carry the album along. The guitar riffs are catchy, and hook you right away. The thing that always impressed me with Iron Maiden, was that, during the 80's most metal bands like Ratt, Posion, Motley Crue etc, were busy playing and singing about rock n' roll, girls and partying. Maiden often based their music on literature; \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", poetry: \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\", history; \\"Aces High\\", \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Run to the Hills\\"; religion; \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", \\"Number of the Beast\\" and mythology \\"Icarus\\" and \\"Poweslave\\". The great epic metal tunes on Iron Maiden disks defied the conventions of the time, where most bands stuck to radio-friendly, 5 minutes or less rock anthems. Iron Maiden was, and is more than just a standard metal band, and if you are a music fan, you are doing yourself a great dis-service if you don't pick up the disks from the heyday. \\"Somewhere in Time\\" features 8 great track, each better than the one before it. Listen to \\"Alexander the Great\\" and ask yourself if any other band at the height of their popularity would have been able to put that song on a cd. The guitar riff on \\"Wasted Years\\" will be running through your head all day, and you will be humming the chorus of \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" for a long time. This is a great album, from a band that always brought a little more to the table than just catchy rock anthems.
B000000H66|5.0|This is my favorite album ever and most of my guitar work is heavily influenced by it.  It has my favorite drummer, Gene Hoglan, one of my favorite bassists, Kelly Conlon, and my favorite musician, Chuck Schuldiner.  Symbolic is the perfect mix of melody and relentless, thrashy metal.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you like Tool, and you are looking to buy your first Tool album, this is the one. Much of the work is allegorical and each time you listen to it you get a deeper and deeper meaning. Maynard's writing on this album is spectacular. The title song \\"Aenima\\" is a kick in the face of modern Hollywood-centered society and Maynard holds absolutely nothing back in his description of this \\"three-ring circus.\\" There are many other notable songs on this album including the accusatory \\"Eulogy\\" Maynard sings to (presumably) a hypocritical preacher (but who really knows). \\"Forty-six and 2\\" is about Jung's view on pyschology and evolution itself; a simple search on yahoo explains a lot about what 46 and 2 presumably means. \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" is a brilliant song about those who criticize Tool as a band that has sold out; He makes a point that if Tool sold out, and you bought the album, what does that make you? <br /> <br />Although the music isn't really as hard as a lot of other bands out there, fans of Peter, Paul, and Mary would be turned off by heavy guitar riffs, pounding drums, reverberating bass, and often vulgar language; however Maynard only uses \\"offensive language\\" to express his primal rage and frustration, and boy can he get frustrated. <br /> <br />Be prepared for a lot of randomness too. The song \\"(-)Ions\\" is just the sound of buzzing electricity with wind in the background. The song \\"Die Eier Von Satan\\" is one that I use to defend this type of heavy industrial-like music. The song is in German and Maynard screams a few verses intermixed with a steady chant. At first listen many neophytes of Tool would suggest that it is some gothic devil-worshiping chant, but those who speak German would be surprised to find that it is a recipe for cookies. Thus is the humor of Tool's frontman, Maynard James Keenan.
B00000099Y|5.0|I do not know how anyone could put Tool's talent down. Maybe you don't agree with the lyrics, maybe Maynard's voice isn't your cup of tea but Tool is the most talented band out there. Their cds are full of everything you could want, Maynard going from soaring screams to haunting whispers. Lyrics that will make you think way more then you probably should. I would love to see the concert that had Meshuggah with Tool. You can't go wrong with any of Tool's cds. I listen to at least one Tool cd everyday, usually on my drive to work. The lyrics may be a problem for some, especially the songs that go into religion but I don't think that Maynard intended for the songs to be sacreligious in the way Marilyn Manson does, just to shock. I believe these are his true feelings towards organized religion and the matyrdom of Jesus. There is no band out today that has more of my respect then Tool does. Anyone who likes metal, rock, alt-rock, industrial, even country should own this cd. It will make you look like a music expert.
0062502182|5.0|Reading some reviews I felt that people, who sounded disappointed with the book, had unreasonable expectations about it. If you are looking for a recipe how to change you life it might take much more than one book.  The Alchemist touches your heart makes you wish you followed your dream and became a different person, however it is a wonderful fairy tale and has nothing to do with implementing a great American practical dream of how to become successful and happy. If you are after a sweet masterpiece without immediate practical implementation, enjoy it.  Also people who are upset with author talking only about riches, money, greed they just lack imagination.  Who says that your treasure is money?  It is only what you, yourself, choose it to be.
B00005JMJG|5.0|What a big WOW this movie was. Simple, moving, intelligent, well written, and perfectly acted, what more could one ask for?! <br /> <br />I have read some reviews that said that the plot was complicated, but I must fiercely disagree; the plot is as easy to follow as it is easy to watch. Woman erases man, man wants to erase woman, man changes his mind. The real fun is in watching them escape from memory to memory in a funny, tear-jerking move to save his love from extinction. <br /> <br />This movie is perfectly acted. Carrey gives, easily, his finest serious performance, and probably his best overall. One can literally see the pain in his face, which is looking its age I might add; never-the-less, for the first time I was moved by one of his performances. Other great jobs in the film were done by: Dunst (perfect for the cute, free secretary), Ruffalo (looking good in the undies), Wilkinson (in a role that nearly mimics that of _In the Bedroom_), and Wood (great as the unlikable thief). However, these, to me, pale in comparison to the superb (and hopefully Oscar winning) performance of Kate Winslet as the off the wall girlfriend with a thousand haircolors. She really blew me away (as she always does). <br /> <br />See this move, bottom line. It is not just a crazy \\"art movie\\" like so many I have talked about. Just see it and you will see the beauty that is locked inside the \\"Mind.\\"
B00005ABIP|5.0|Pretty damn good effort by Cake, with the best track being \\"Sheep Go To Heaven\\". That song is what brought me a slice of the cake in the first place, and it is still my favorite Cake track. Song ratings: <br /> <br />1. Satan Is My Motor - 8/10: I didn't like this song at first, but after a couple of listens, it grew on me. The song's a bit slow at times, but steady -- very, steady. <br />2. Mexico - 7/10: Pretty sad and slightly depressing. Good song to listen to if you're feeling down. Me? I tend to skip it. <br />3. Never There - 10/10: One of the most catchy songs ever. An essential listen if you're into the band. <br />4. Guitar - 10/10: As the name might imply, this song is mostly John McCrea, a guitar, and some drums. The song also has a slight Mexican accent to it, which makes it all that better. It's a great tune to listen to if you're feeling down or if you just want something playing in the background. <br />5. You Turn The Screws - 9/10: Good song. Confrontational. Demanding. Catchy hook. Something to listen to if you're feeling angry. The piano pieces also fit very well, and gives the song that extra spice. <br />6. Walk On By - 9/10: Sad, slightly depressing. Awesome music. <br />7. Sheep Go To Heaven - 10/10: This song is what I define Cake by. It's goofy. It's catchy. He's singing about goats. What more do you want? <br />8. When You Sleep - 8/10: Slow, yet somewhat uplifting. Great music. Interesting lyrics. <br />9. Hem of Your Garment - 10/10: Good hook, catchy music; definitely something you'll bounce to. <br />10. Alpha Beta Parking Lot - 7.5/10: I didn't like it the first time I heard the song, and it hasn't really grown on me yet. It's not a bad song, but there are much more better ones in the pool. <br />11. Let Me Go - 10/10: Very good music; I think I've heard it before I got into the band, but I'm not sure. It's very familiar, with a hint of Country and old fashion Rock. Lyrics are slightly depressing, but you'll find yourself singing thethree words in the title. <br />12. Cool Blue Reason - 8/10: Similar to \\"Alpha Beta Parking Lot\\", but a bit more upbeat. I also didn't like this song right away, but it's grown on me. <br />13. Where Would I Be? - 7/10: Slow, confrontational, and depressing. One of my least favorite Cake songs.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is a complete album. I am not a diehard fan of The Clash, Sandinista killed it for me but this is the best. I cannot believe that Lover's Rock was not on the the newest 2 cd hits package. I had lost alot of my cds from constant moving. I couldn't find any of my Clash cds. I go and buy the Essential double disc without even looking at the songs. I get home and listen, no Lover's Rock so I go back and buy this album. It is a better listen from start to finish then the double cd is. One thing I will warn to anyone who hasn't heard it, Lost in the Supermarket, will be stuck in your heads forever. Then there is the title song which is still the only punk song that sends chills up my spine. This is the perfect present for anyone. It is a cliche to say it has something for everyone but this cd truly does.
B0002IQHY8|3.0|I've got all the APP and the AP's albums... Even the related ones like the Woolfson's ones or the Michael Ernst's Excalibur. The Woolfson's era are the best but this is over... But I don't think I'll miss Andrew Powell and Ian Bairnson this much. <br /> <br />The two remixes, for my part, saves the CD. It reminds me of the good time. The last song on the album, Chomolungma, is the best new songs. Except for the dogs barking... <br /> <br />The song We play the game is interesting with Bairnson's style guitar. <br /> <br />The rest of the CD, specially the bad song More without you (I just can't believe that's Alan Parsons' music). <br /> <br />Maybe it's time to move on and let the son play the music... (Can you think of a big Remixes album by Jeremy Parsons ?)
B000002B35|5.0|I had never listened to a Pink Floyd cd before Pulse.  I originally thought that they were dead relics of an age which I had no part of.  On a long road trip, a buddy of mine jacked this cd in.  Normally I detest live shows on cds, with the exception of S&M.  However, this collection totally blew my mind.  Disk two, as I now know is mostly comprised of Dark Side of the Moon, left me in total awe and even haunted by the sound.  How many other bands use strange voices and sound effects like Speak To Me, Breathe, Money, or Us And Them?  Definitly worth purchasing and leaving in a 5 disk changer.
B000003CKH|5.0|Typically known as the best Cake album ever, and I don't disagree. All of the songs in the CD are great, and they all stand out from one another. Song ratings: <br /> <br />1. Frank Sinatra - 10/10: Very catchy beat; excellent music; prepare to hit \\"repeat\\" or \\"replay\\" over and over for this one. <br />2. The Distance - 10/10: The casual fan's favorite. Everybody's heard of this track, and if you haven't.. what are you waiting for? <br />3. Friend is a Four Letter Word - 9/10: Cake slows the pace down with this song. Interesting lyrics. <br />4. Open Book - 10/10: Very confrontational. Witty lyrics. McCrea sounds pissed. <br />5. Daria - 9/10: The music sounds weird during the first few listens, but it gradually becomes better and better with each play. <br />6. Race Car Ya-Yas - 10/10: ...and back to the speeding highway we go. Literally. This song is... uh, bizarre. Weird. Yet catchy -- VERY catchy. Too bad it runs at around 1:20 seconds, which is an insanely short length for such an awesome song. And I won't even comment on the lyrics. <br />7. I Will Survive - 10/10: This song is, of course, the cover of the infamous hit that everybody and their great grandmother has heard of. Cake puts an interesting spin to the song, with a lot of guitar and bass.  <br />8. Stickshifts And Safetybelts - 6.5/10: Well, there had to be one flawed song on the album, and that's this. It's a little bit too Country to me. <br />9. Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps - 8/10: Catchy hook, nice music. <br />10. It's Coming Down - 8/10: Another confrontational song; the music is alright, but not too memorable. <br />11. Nugget - 10/10: Whoa. Whoa. McCrea is pissed. Music is awesome. <br />12. She'll Come Back To Me - 9/10: Very depressing music and lyric. Very fitting for the subjet in question, however. <br />13. Italian Leather Sofa - 9/10: Heh, lyrics are pretty funny, and the song is upbeat and lifting. <br />14. Sad Songs & Waltzes - 9/10: Wow. The most depressing song ever -- you can almostfeel John's pain as he sings. Lyrics and music match one another very well, and it's almost guaranteed that you'll feel a bit down after listening to this.
B00005JNEI|1.0|There are no true grounds for any of the claims made in this film. <br /> <br />It's trash.  Though I suppose you could use the DVD as a coaster. <br /> <br />
0553573403|4.0|A great book and series, although definately not for all.<br /><br />Fantasy books too often are full of holes from sub-standard writing, poor character developement, and hackneyed plots--a poor story that is a medium for magic, swords, and the supernatural.<br /><br />You will find none of that here.<br /><br />The colorful descriptions of Westeros and its inhabitants are more than enough for any fantasy fan to enjoy, and the tired magic/flaming swords are replaced by a more intelligent and subtle kind of mystique.  The suberfugue, backstabbing, and politics of the plot help rise this series above other fantasy epics and allow for appreciation from a broader audience.  The writing, again, is one of the best I've read in fantasy thanks to the efforts of such an accomplished and experienced author as George R.R. Martin.<br /><br />That being said, although I would rate this book 5 stars among other epic fantasies, I still found a few major flaws that prevent it from appealing to many people unfamiliar with the genre.<br /><br />As with all epics, fantasy or no, this book/series is long. I personally enjoy long books and huge, epic plots,(W&P, Hyperion Cantos) but one of the bitter complaints I hear with epic fantasies is that they NEVER END. Other epic fantasies I've finished could keep my interest because of my fresh mindset at the time. Unfortunately this genre has been on a long downward spiral from over-ambitious authors and profit-hungry publicists. They keep the audience attracted with the huge scope of the story and the layers apon layers of sub plots, side stories, perspectives, etc. As I said before, Song of Ice and Fire is far above the others, but still suffers from the fundamental flaws of a fantasy epic.<br /><br />If you like suberfugue and politics, good, long, story-telling, have patience, and are tired of the same-old same-old in fantasy, I would recommend this book.<br /><br />Those of you who are squeamish of violence and sex and expect to see an ending or closure of some sort within +2000 pages of writing, beware.and expect to see an ending or closure of some sort within +2000 pages of writing, beware.

068987474X|1.0|I read one chapter of this book and it made me want to heave.  According to the author's premise, I've been happily married for twelve years to a man who \\"just isn't that into\\" me--which I happen to know is untrue.  There are lots of ways to be \\"into\\" someone and human behavior can't be reduced to a set of simplistic rules.  Like any magic solution, this book is bound to disappoint ultimately.
B0000666DW|5.0|Mastodon's Remission is simply phenomenal. It's got everything from angry shouting vocals, loud crushing guitar riffs, pummeling bass lines, and very intense drumming, I mean it sounds a lot like doom metal to me. The album kicks off with two very intense numbers \\"Crusher Destroyer\\" and \\"March Of The Fire Ants\\" which show the band's tight muscianship. The 6 min+ epic \\"Ol'e Nessie\\" starts out slow and moody, and really heats up when the insane riffs take command. \\"Burning Man\\" is another great song with some insane drum work at the opening part of the song. So anyway, if you're into some real heavy technical metal, this album is yours. HAIL MASTODON!!

0156027321|5.0|Not that I measure a book by it's ability to elicit emotion, except that I do. I'm not much of a reviewer so I'll be brief. I loved this book because the author allowed me to fall in love with the characters. I got to know everyone deeply, meaningfully and once I was properly entranced, I was clobbered over the head with a kind of brutal reality I seldom encounter in modern fiction. I'm going to try and understand it all as I go to bed tonight, grateful for my bed and shower and refrigerator full of goodies. I'll be pondering my own limits and capabilities as I go about another civilized day of comfortable existence. This book is a master work of storytelling and it is so loaded with meanings and symbolism, I could go on for days raving about the eloquence of each reference. But of course, I won't do that. <br /> <br />Enjoy, escpecially the laughs at the beginning.
B00003CXCT|5.0|O.k., I know I'm going to be lynched for saying this, but here goes, \\"These movies do NOT belong to the fans, they are GEORGE LUCAS'S just as they have always been.  We PAY HIM for the PRIVELEDGE of watching them.\\"    As for the SE, they are all superior to the originals.  As for the \\"Greedo shot first, so Han was defending himself, and wasn't redeemed at the end\\" argument.  GREEDO WAS POINTING A BLASTER AT THE MAN IN BOTH VERSIONS, IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE EITHER WAY (if you have any other arguments against this please e-mail me...seriously, I don't believe an argument that dumb could be what's fueling this complaint, I must be missing something)!    Now, while I was re-watching these movies for the Idon'tknowhowmanyeth time (although I haven't watch them much in the last few years, since my copy of ANH broke), something happened.  While I have always enjoyed both trilogies, they finally came together.  And not just the Special Editions, but scenes that remained exactly as they were in the original became part of a larger saga.  Suddenly Darth Vader was transformed into Anakin Skywalker (as was reinforced by the new ending).  I began to see touches of Amidala in Leia, and Luke became a mixture of his father from both \\"Phantom Menace\\", and \\"Attack of the Clones\\".    These movies are the greatest ever made.  In fact the Star Wars saga is currently composed of the five greatest movies ever made in reverse order (\\"Return of the Jedi\\" being the best, and \\"Phantom Menace\\" being number five).    By the way, Jarjar is no goofier in the new movies than C-3PO was in the old ones.

The thing is, it is all based in fact. With the Bush administration offering no transparency in regards to the war what-so-ever, everything is speculation. Fox news and all the cheerleading pundits are speculating, too. Take the facts, leave the facts, twist 'em how ever you want.

B00003CXCT|5.0|When I first saw Star Wars at age 7 it was at a drive-in theater and though I enjoyed a great movie the picture and sound pretty much was a bomb.  Now I can watch it on my beautiful TV and hear it through my surround sound system and enjoy it even more then I did when I was a kid.  I could go into the whole thing about Lucas changing things and playing with Star Wars, blah, blah, blah but lets face it no matter how many times he changes things we will keep buying it because it si Star Wars BABY!!!!  It is a part of our life at this point, be it if you were alive when it first hit the silver screen or when it was rereleased in theaters.  Star Wars has gone beyond generational at this point and has become a part of Americana just like apple pie.  Buy the set, order a pizza, sit back in your pjs and spend a day watching Star Wars.
0393035158|5.0|While everyone is reading The Da Vinci Code and other so-called page-turners, I bought The End of Faith, based solely on a review I had read. Talk about a terrific read. (I've underlined and highlighted so much in it, I probably should have only underlined those very few passages that I DIDN'T feel were worthy of the spotlight.) The footnotes and bibliography bespeak the research and documentation that are so often absent these days from the non-fiction rants that are flooding the bookstores. Here, amazingly, is an author who seems to value scientific thought and process: reason over voodoo. What a refreshing concept, then, given the fact that our so-called role models in DC seem so retro that they'd have us cure diseases with leeches and blood-letting if left to their unchecked philosophical devices! Ron Reagan, of all people, on Larry King a while ago, stated he could never run for president because he's an atheist. (And Harris echoes a similar thought about the type of person who is apt to be elected these days.) How many folks out there are secretly pondering the same themes as Harris and wishing a voice of reason would boldly rise up to say what needs to be said. This author has given voice to those who savor intelligent commentary, as free from spin and dogma as possible, and who believe America is currently on a dangerous track in a dangerous world too complex for the simplistic ideas and narrow world-views of the current Administration. The End of Faith should be on everyone's MUST READ list, hopefully not to get lost, as the diamond it is, in the published manure being churned out by so many hacks. This is one book that I'd give a sixth star to if such a rating were available.
B00003CXQY|3.0|I can't say I was particularly jumping over the moon to see this. I haven't seen a Disney animation since Pocahontas, and don't particularly care to see one ever again, apart from the old classics, like Cinderella, Snow White and Peter Pan. (Just don't sit me down in front of Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty or any of the Fantasia stuff).<br /><br />The characters are all like previous characters in previous Disney animations. Kuzco was a longer haired version of Aladdin, the male characters apart from Kuzco all had the square jaws reminiscent of the guys in Pocahontas, and Yzma is a mixture of Snow White's evil stepmother and Cruella De Ville. And some of the landscapes look very familiar.<br /><br />I did like the ending, but the rest of the movie didn't really do it for me. And I nearly died when it started, you know a film's gonna be bad, when Tom Jones does the title track! Considering the makers of the film originally wanted to get Sting to sing the opening song but he said he was too old, they need someone more hip and younger. So they went with Tom Jones. Sting is in his 50's, Tom is in his 60's.<br /><br />This is also the first Disney animation to show a pregnant woman, that being Pacha's wife. Never mind falling slightly behind the times, there's also all the hooha about Kuzco and Pacha being slightly more friendly than kids will understand!<br /><br />Like many other Disney films, this one contains a number of hidden Mickey Mouse images. One is in the bushes when Kuzco gets pulled from the water and another is Yzma's head and earrings (upside down).<br /><br />In the scene where Yzma is searching through the various potions she says, \\"Lions, tigers and bears...oh my!\\" a line from The Wizard of Oz. According to producer Randy Fullmer and director Mark Dindal, they were forced to use this joke, which they detested, by then-head of Feature Animation Thomas Schumacher.<br /><br />There's one great line I really did like, you'll probably have to see the film to enjoy it (not that I'm condoning that you understand): \\"Who's in my chair..?\\" \\"Ooh, ooh, I know! I know! Yzma's in your chair!\\"<br /><br />There's loads of extras on this DVD, if you can actually have the time to watch them all. Frankly, they all look frightfully tedious, but if you're into that kinda thing, then goody for you.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this DVD, but I'm still giving it a semi good score. If you wanna see it, go knock yourself out. Kronk by far overshadows Kuzco. And the ending's funny. That's about it.film to enjoy it (not that I'm condoning that you understand): \\"Who's in my chair..?\\" \\"Ooh, ooh, I know! I know!

B0000DD7LC|3.0|I don't think it sucks, but it's nothing special either. I own it, but i don't listen to it very often. Alicia Keys is one of those artists that are hyped up by MTV and the media like they were the greatest thing since sliced bread. I bought this CD because is was on sale, but I would never spend 10-15 bucks on it. <br />
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I can only agree with everything positive that's been said here. But what struck me most about the movie is that, although at first it doesn't seem like it, Eastwood's character really does earn the title of 'good' throughout the course of the film. Leone establishes that virtue consists of more than being the one most wronged in a situation or killing the villains with some small amount of reluctance. Although he is no great samaritan, The Man With No Name is willing to go to great and elaborate lengths to do the right thing and give someone else a chance at redemtpion. In the end, I think this movie is really about Tuco - caught between the extremes of Angel Eyes and TMWNN, he lives a life of crime out of neccesity, because life is more difficult for him than for an unreal character like TMWNN, but he has the potential for both good and evil.
038551123X|3.0|A different serial killer. Our hero. Though the ending is seen from far ahead, this is worthy of following.
B0002IU988|5.0|Totally addicted to Myles Kennedy's voice.  Incredible.  I've had this CD about a month, and played it constantly.  Tried to listen to Creed but couldn't stand Scott Stapp.  This is NOT Creed.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Love him or hate him, Moore has fashioned a powerful indictment of a president who probably has never been on the \\"internets\\". There is also real power in the stories of some average people, you will not forget.

B00007ELEL|5.0|Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are perfectly cast in this weird offbeat buddy film. The plot is implausible and often bizzare but the performances are great. Reminded me  little of Pulp fiction in terms of style and very quotable dialogue. I'm not saying it isn't original but it definitely is in that category of weirdness. Ultimately Bridges character The Dude is one of the most memorable he's ever done. Goodman is very funny as a  partly deranged vietnam vet friend of the Dude as he manages to be both offensive and sympathetic at the same time. Very cool movie.
B0006213WG|5.0|ive had this cd for a few days now...and it packs a punch like never before. they have been moving further and further away from pop punk ever since \\"ALL KILLER\\" with many metal moments on they last release \\"INFECTED\\" and are now more metal than punk. but fans wont be dissapointed.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|The bonus material is not essential, but it does give the film an edge that was missing from the theatrical release.  The deleted footage of William losing his virginity and the silent \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" makes the pace of the movie completely different.  Commentary by Crowe and his mother reveals where a few scenes came from with additional details.  Overall, I think \\"The Bootleg Cut\\" is one of the best extended edition DVDs with both versions of the film and the Stillwater CD.
B0002MPU1K|3.0|If you're looking for some quasi-jazz, pop-music, reminiscent of Michael Buble and Norah Jones, then you've found it in Peter Cincotti's ON THE MOON.  I enjoy listening to it , but not for the same reasons that Cincotti's self-titled debut has become one of my favorite albums.  The sophomore project lacks the quality of Cincotti's first project; the driving bass that embellished many of the songs on the first album seems to have disappeared as have Cincotti's timeless vocals. The very timbre of his voice seems different from track to track on the new album.  The song selection seemed hopeful, paraticularly the first track, which is the best track from ON THE MOON, but it's downhill from there for individuals looking for a good contemporary jazz album.  I'll still listen to ON THE MOON, and enjoy it, but it is a disappointment after Cincotti's smashing debut.
B000003TAR|5.0|alright, nirvana is my favorite band of all time, the guitaring isn't insane, the lyrics sometimes don't make sence but they still kick a$$. Anyways, Everyone talks about nevermind, like it was the only album that mattered (Don't get me wrong, i love the album) but, in my opinion, In Utero, is there best album. Bleach, wasn't there best, but what could you excpect for 650 bucks. Nevermind, of couse brought nirvana out, so theres no way that i can say it's bad. But then they made there last studio album, In Utero, The album want as popular as nevermind, but it still sold, I found nevermind to repeat a bit. But in Utero had all of it, The meaningful yet simple \\"Serve the servants\\" the raw screams of \\"Scentless Aprentice\\", It also three of my davorite Nirvana songs, \\"Rape me\\", eith it's wierd name, and i'm not sure if it has to do with rape, \\"Pennyroal tea\\" witch is'nt thats complicated but is just nice to sit down and listen to, and my all time favorite \\"Heart shaped box\\" It's got a sweet guitar lick for an into, its slow, and then hard..it's perfect. Another reason i think In utero didn't catch on, was because polaces like Wal MArt and K mart, would not sell the cd originaly, because of the pictures of the unborn babies and plastic bodie parts on the back cover (Witch 6 year old science students see)(And wasn't nevermind a naked baby?) Anyways, In Utero has aeverythign and i recomend it to everyone espesially nivana fans!<br />RIP Kurt
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. But I would like to highly recommend the many extras on this DVD. Many times the extra items on a DVD are just fillers, but each and every one of the documentaries, cartoons, radio shows, and trailers, are worth the price of the DVD even beyond this excellent classic movie. You have an audio track commentary that goes along with the movie that really gives you insight and trivia about the movie instead of just being a prattling nusisance. Then there is a complete documentary on John Huston hosted by the late Robert Mitchum. There is a piece by Leonard Maltin. There are 2, count 'em 2, Bugs Bunny cartoons. One on each DVD. There is a copy of an old radio show where Bogart and Walter Huston reprise their rolls. There were other short features from the era in their entirety. <br /> <br />I'm probably missing something, there was so much to enjoy. The quality of these extra features really made an already enjoyable movie even better.
B00005JMXX|1.0|This movie was too stupid and unrealistic to enjoy.  That's all I have to say.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I have never seen a film that has impressed me more than this one.  In addition to being clever and extremely well-done, it is well-documented and just plain fascinating! <br />  <br />Before seeing the film, I tried to show some understanding of Bush supporters.  No more.  I want all of them to see this film and then tell me if they will ever be able to look at the Bush dynasty the same way as before.  Even if only a tiny percentage of the facts presented in this film were true... even if only one fact were true, we have the wrong man in the Whitehouse! <br />  <br />I will recommend this film to everyone in America.  See it before November 2, 2004!!
B0006419J6|5.0|How can ANYONE HONESTLY NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE?  It litterally had everything. Sure, it doesn't really live up to the original book, but this movie is still pretty freakin' good.  I loved Will Smith's one-liners and smart remarks.  One of my favorite lines was \\"I'm allergic to bullsh*t\\".  I (and the rest of the theater for that matter) was rolling with laughter.  And the villain in this movie came as a suprise to me. <br /> <br />YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT!  I give I Robot a 5 out of 5!
B00005JMXX|2.0|What can I say about this movie? This is another great example of a Modern hollywood release that uses lots of marketing to make lots of hype about a very crappy movie. <br /> <br />The day after tomorrow is about the concept of \\"what if global warming happened tomorrow and ruined the whole world in a few days\\". Coneceptually this is not genious, but could have made for a pretty good disaster movie. I for one was very excited when I heard that this was coming from the same guy who did \\"Independence Day\\". Plus the trailer looked cool as all hell and there was a lot of hype going around about this movie. I went to the theater wanting to like what I saw.  <br /> <br />The problem was that what I saw was beyond a mere disapointment and bordered on robbery. I cannot tell you how badly I wanted back my 8 dollars after the credits began to roll.  <br /> <br />For starters the acting is just pathetic. As is most of the storyline, characters, and diologue. Now let me tell you - I had no disillusions either. You only expect so much from a movie of this sort in the way of acting and diologue and such - which is how I managed to enjoy independence day, I liked it for what it was. But \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" Lowers the bar so much further that it is bad in these areas even when compared to other pictures in it's own genre! The best part of the movie was the special effects and the action - which is sad as you will soon find out. <br /> <br />This is one of those cases where the trailer is actually better than the whole movie. The special effects are very impressive at points, but short lived. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the cool parts of the movie. Everything good about it could be condensed into that 3 minute preview - so save yourself the trouble.  <br /> <br />The rest of the special effects are lame, I didnt goto the theater to see CGI wolves that go crazy and they never explain why!. And the super cold air that freezes things on contact os just stupid... original, but stupid. The action sequences are poorly put together - especially since you absolutely dont care about any single one of the charaters (by the way the 'love story' component of the movie is just pitifully portrayed). At times you may actually be wanting them to die so the movie will end. <br /> <br />This not to mention the entire film continually shoves an environmental moral down your throat. The sad thing is the movie would score better as a political message against the dangers of messing up the planet than it does as a special effect disaster flick. <br /> <br />The Day After Tomorrow could have been everything Twister, INdependence Day, Deep Impact and Dantes Peak was all rolled into one. But instead it turned out to be a very expensive popcorn snack and 2 hours of my life I'll never reclaim.
1400032717|4.0|He's actually older than he seems. He likes Maths. He knows when it's going to be a good day, a super good day or a black day. He's not your typical teenaged protagonist, that's why you keep reading, that's why you feel like you can't leave him... on his journey to discover the end to a mystery, unlocking his own truths while writing his own book.<br /><br />Logical, calculating (literally), and burdoned with a mind so unlike our own, this jem of a novel is a cry for those who can't stop thinking, can't stop noticing everything, can't stop being what they are... and they're sorry.<br /><br />He just wants to feel safe, and you will be when you read Mark Haddon's book. It's an instant *~FAVORITE BOOK EVER~*
B000000JO3|4.0|The first thing you must realise about minor threat is that they are horribly overrated. When I first heard this album, I was dissapointed as it was not as great as everyone kept saying it was. There are much better bands to listen to when it comes to hardcore punk. <br /> <br />Saying that though, this is still very good. Ian McKaye, Brian Baker and the rest of them have created an essential hardcore punk album that everyone who enjoys hardcore should hear. If you arent a fan of hardcore, stay away, you will probably find this quite innaccessable, as with most hardcore bands, minor threat are an aquired taste. Highlights here include Minor threat, Salad Days, I dont wanna hear it and of course straight edge.
B00005JMAH|4.0|This movie was definitely better than the other two.  While all are in my favorite movies list, this one really hit me.  People are complaining that it wasn't what they expected, well, sorry folks but that's bound to happen when YOU'RE not directing it.  Roughly a 400 page book into what Warner Brothers gave Alfonso (141 minutes) is a very hard thing to do.  One page of script is rougly equal to one minute of screen time.  You obviously cannot fit a 400 page book into a 141 page screenplay.  There are going to be things left out. <br /> <br />The filming is 100x better, the use of colors, scenery, and costume are top notch.  You see Harry, Hermione, and Ron (including all others) in a different light, you see them for once, as teenagers, not as students 24/7.  Even if it's not in the book, these kids DO have a life outside of Hogwarts.  You see Malfoy in an entirely different light, as the coward that he is deep down inside (and you WILL find examples of that in the books...)   <br /> <br />The introduction of Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore is harsh at first, but adds a lot to the character.  He loses the \\"caring\\" touch that Richard Harris had, but is very funny.  He is wise, and kooky, and you can see why Harry is so fond of him.  <br /> <br />And people, keep in mind, the decisions are not entirely based on the director.  The production is also affected by the PRODUCER, which is CHRIS COLUMBUS, who directed the first two.  Not to mention, the screenwriter, Steve Kloves, who dearly devotes/devoted years of his life to bringing Harry Potter to life.  He is booked all the way into, at least, 2007 with the movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  <br /> <br />Overall, I would give this 4.5 stars if possible, but cannot here on Amazon.  It did lack a sort of magic that the first two had, but Harry, Hermione, and Ron are growing up fast.  Hermione blossoms and Ron and Harry are clearly growing into adults.  Malfoy's voice deepens and he even sports a new hair cut.   <br /> <br />Final note:  If you are not a fan of change, you might have a hard time with this one.  It's very different than the first two, but don't go into it, if you haven't seen it, with high expectations.  Let it all happen naturally, and you'll be in for a magical time.
B000002O03|4.0|It is certainly a great album. It's not a really historical album, but still it shows the geniality behind this band, that represents really well the Southern rock. The album has some really great hits such as \\"Tuesday is gone\\" and \\"Simple man\\", also featuring their best song ever, \\"Freebird\\", which is just fabulous. The longest, and one of the most spectacular guitar solos, a real guitar duel, not talking about the drums: just makes you fly like a freebird. The album starts really well with \\"I ain't the one\\". In \\"Gimme three steps\\", \\"Things going on\\" and \\"Mississipi Kid\\", they show us the power of Southern rock. \\"Poison Whiskey\\" is just fantastic; a mix of country and hard rock, really well played. Ronnie Van Zant's voice is the typical southern man voice and it gives the band that good ol' red neck taste. And besides, these guys are able to combine three guitars wonderfully well, making the sound complete. Don't forget to pay attention to keyboards, especially when it comes to that old western piano: just amazing.
B000002U9L|5.0|This album has the single most excellent song ever known to mankind ... \\"Magic Dance\\". The deep chord changes and sounds just are ... amazing. Words really cannot even begin to descibe the artistic greatness. This song is legendary. The lyrics are so deep. \\"Slap that baby make him free,\\" there is so much meaning behind that. I mean, deep down inside we all have a baby that needs to be slapped and made free. I want to set my baby free everytime I hear this song. This album will go down in history as the best soundtrack ever known to mankind. The reason why I gave this album 5 stars is there weren't anymore stars to give. If I could I would give this song a 30 or 100 stars. I would give it as many stars as there are in the sky. I have listened to many songs in the course of my life and I'm 29 years old, that's alot of songs, and I walked out of the church on my wedding to \\"Undergtound\\". But \\"Magic Dance\\" is the greatest song in the world. If you haven't bought this album what are you waiting for!!!! It truly rocks my face off.
B0000025AI|5.0|I like to put this album in the CD player and improv/jam away with it.<br />Some songs like TV Mama which is a Slide+Steel guitar tune gives you a litlle break. You'll need it for 'Walking Thru The Park' with Muddy Waters.<br />The album is lively and has certain Bluesman sense of humour that's very characteristic to Johnny Winter.<br />Anyone that likes a more Power Blues, Johnny Winter and/or Slide blues can not be disappointed with this album.
6305609705|5.0|One of the best war movies ever made, Apocalypse Now chronicles Lt. Willard's travels upriver through Vietnam and into Cambodia to assasinate a renegade Colonel.<br /><br />Coppola's film is a master of the seemingly incongruous.  In the middle of a bloody attack is a Lt. Colonel who loves surfing.  In the middle of the dark green jungle is an orange and white tiger.  Out of the darkness comes the brightly lit Du Long bridge.  Among the sea of soldiers in an army base are two playboy bunnies in a USO Show.  Amid the destruction and madness at the conclusion of the film is a poetry-quoting colonel and a grungy-looking photojournalist.  The contrasts add much to the film, never out-of-place for the sake of shock value, just adding to the anti-war sentiment that is prevalent throughout the film but rarely overtly declared.<br /><br />Even on the surface this is a very good film.  It follows the basic concept of a road movie (travel from point A to point B, with adventures along the way), the characters are interesting and sufficiently developed, the voiceovers never redundant or too expository, the war scenes very well done, with special notice to the helicopter assault on the village and the chaotic, frenzied but strangely beautiful scene at the Du Long bridge.  9.5/10
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Here I am, a 47 yr. male who gave Slipknot a try for the first time with buying Vol.3 (The Subliminal Verses), as well as reading all the positive reviews on this album.<br /><br />Ya' know what? Where has Slipknot been all my life! I've had the CD for about 3 weeks now and have been unable to put it down! It seems to get better each time I listen to it. I had gone to Ozzfest 2004 and had seen Slipknot at an extreme \\"stage left\\" view standing on a picnic table and was impressed with there looks and sound, and the lead guitarist(s)\\"headbanging\\" style was awesome!! I had seen a \\"clown\\" banging a drum back and forth on stage. Big deal........I now understand clowns part as well as the rest of these extremely talented artists.<br /><br />There are really no words that already haven't been spoken about just how good Vol.3 really is. The guitar riffs are to me much more explosive and heavy as say Black Sabbath's (Vol.4). Now there's an album you won't be able to put down either!<br /><br />By the way, I ordered \\"Iowa\\", and I hope that I am as happy with that as I am with (Verses).
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Although the phrase \\"I don't see what all the fuss is about\\" will no doubt earn me scores of non-helpful votes from fans of the film, I must say that I was surprised at the reception received by this film.  Beyond the solid direction, there's very little original territory here.<br /><br />I must say that I knew nothing about this movie when I walked in.  I did not know that Tom Cruise was the villain, something that people have payed way too much attention to.  If they cast Michael Jackson as a missionary it doesn't make it neccesarily a good film.  Similarly, casting Jamie Foxx as a non-comedian is no bolder than casting rap stars on Law and Order Special Victims Unit.  Casting two actors agaisnt type won't overcome a hackneyed script.<br /><br />Is there any doubt that Jamie Foxx will survive this movie?  Is there ever a question that he will be reunited with Jada Pinkett Smith by the climax of the film?  Is there any reason to have the cop-who-knows-there's-more-to-the-story-but-his-fellow-cops-won't-beleive-him?  There is nothing original here, and solid performances and superb direction by Mann don't elevate this beyond a standard thriller.  5/10
B00005JNEU|4.0|Based on H.G. (\\"Buzz\\") Bissinger's book with the same title and directed by Peter Berg, this film focuses on the Permian (Texas) High School Panthers' 1988 season which ended in the state championship game played in the Houston Astrodome against Dallas Carter High School. Frankly, although I have lived in Texas for almost 30 years and am well aware of the passion which football at all levels generates throughout the state, I still find it difficult to believe the nature and extent of pressure which otherwise sensible adults place on the importance of winning games. Permian coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) is a case in point. If we are to believe Bissinger's account, Gaines was in real danger of losing his job if the Panthers lost the state championship game. (Interestingly, he and his team won it the next year.) The quality of acting throughout the cast is solid but several characters (e.g. Charles Billingsley played by Tim McGraw) seem stereotypical. For whatever reasons, Berg fails to develop any of the leading characters (notably Coach Gaines) beyond what would be revealed in a brief encounter at the local Dairy Queen. In fact, for me at least, the only sympathetic character (if there is one) is the team's star running back, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), and that's a bit of a stretch, given his peacock personality. The on-field action seems authentic, especially in the championship game. Among sports films, I rate Friday Night Lights comparable with Rudy (1993) and Remember the Titans (2000) but a notch or two below Hoosiers (1986), Varsity Blues (1999), and Miracle (2004). In terms of sustained suspense and dramatic impact, I rate it lower than, for example, The Last Picture Show (1991) with which it shares a few issues in common and Field of Dreams (1989) which, in contrast, celebrates innocence rather than denigrates it as Friday Night Lights does, albeit by implication.
B00000DCER|3.0|Author Stephen Thomas Erlewine once said something like this about \\"The Best Of Friends\\":   \\"This is for people who like to think they like Hooker, but really just want to hear Eric Clapton wail away.\\"    It sounds a bit like the point of view of an old blues purist, perhaps, but one with a lot of truth to it. Many people who aren't attracted to John Lee Hooker's raw, gritty 40s, 50s and 60s recordings will certainly find these guest star-heavy re-recordings much more accessible, and who knows...maybe some of those who got to know John Lee Hooker when he suddenly popped up on MTV at age 73 can use this music as a \\"gateway\\" to the REAL blues.    This is a compilation of songs from the Hook's last five guest star-heavy albums (plus a couple of previously unreleased recordings). There is really nothing here to match Hooker's magnificent VeeJay-recordings, his best ever band backed material, but this is certainly not bad music...with the possible exception of two stylistically challenged numbers, \\"Chill Out\\" and \\"The Healer\\".  Van Morrison appears on two numbers, \\"I Cover The Waterfront\\", and a slow, soulful \\"Don't Look Back\\", playing guitar and singing a verse or two, and his contributions are really the only ones which add something new to the songs.  Eric Clapton plays relatively restrained guitar on a pretty good \\"Boogie Chillen\\", and \\"This Is Hip\\" and \\"Dimples\\" get a nice swaggering groove going, although neither of them come anywhere close to surpassing the original recordings.    \\"Burnin' Hell\\" is marred by the monotonous guitar playing of Ben Harper, and \\"Baby Lee\\" and \\"I'm In The Mood\\" are too slick, but \\"Tupelo\\" is classic John Lee Hooker, just the Hook himself and his guitar and a piece of plywood to stomp on! And \\"Big Legs, Tight Skirt\\" is really good as well, although not as good as Hooker's definitive rendition which he cut for VeeJay in the mid-50s.  Again, this is a pretty good album, especially for \\"casual\\" blues listeners, but it does fall a little flat when compared to the gritty and powerful waxings Hooker made when he was in his prime.
0312263120|3.0|Dan Brown is a master of piquing his reader's curiosity, and then delaying its satisfaction for hundreds of pages. Typical of Da Vinci and Angels and Demons, this book portrays characters deciphering codes to save the world, assassins attempting to kill of the academic heroes, and villains working from the inside. <br /> <br />The depiction of the National Security Agency in this book sounds credible, although it's hard to judge, as the NSA is by nature very secretive. I trust Brown created much of the detail, which I accept as this book is after all, fiction. Brown did a good job suspending my disbelief, and while I had a fairly good idea how the book would end by about the halfway point, I enjoyed reading it. The last few chapters string the suspense out well, although some of the reviewers here felt that part was overdone. <br /> <br />This book is not up to the level of Da Vinci and Angels and Demons, and it does not invovle religion to the extent of his more popular titles. This suspense/thriller is more along the lines of a Clancy novel, so people should not buy it expecting the inside look at Catholicism they may be accustomed to with Brown. The book deals with U.S. intelligence operations and code breaking, excusively. If you ar enot into military/CIa type intrigue, don't get this book.
B000001EL7|4.0|\\"Love Gun\\" is the last great Kiss album where all 4 of the original members play on it. The studio sessions were quite intense because Kiss had been on a virtual non-stop roller coaster for the past 2 years, only now the roller coaster was starting to veer out of control.<br /><br />The Kiss merchandising empire was in full swing by this time and generating a fortune in profits, but the after-effects of this massive success were beginning to take their toll on the band; inner turmoil was developing as well as alcohol and substance abuse problems with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.<br /><br />But in spite of all this, Kiss still managed to remain focused on their music, and it produced another great album; with the exception of the silly \\"And Then She Kissed Me\\" (don't know whose idea that was!), the album is filled with scorching hard rock classics.<br /><br />\\"I Stole Your Love\\", the great title track, the overlooked \\"Almost Human\\", which features growling vocals from Gene Simmons and another Hendrix-esque feedback guitar solo from Ace Frehley, and the equally overlooked \\"Hooligan\\", which is a nod to Peter Criss' youth growing up in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Last but certainly not least, Ace Frehley makes his lead vocal debut on \\"Shock Me\\"; legend has it that Frehley recorded his vocals while lying on his back so no one could see him singing! Don't know if that's really true, but as flaky as Ace could be sometimes, I wouldn't be surprised if it were!<br /><br />\\"Love Gun\\" belongs in any Kiss fans' CD collection as well as fans of hard rock!
B00005JNEI|2.0|Before I get started, I have to say... I have no political affiliation. I vote independent. Both parties are so far gone from normal Americans, it's high time we removed them both.<br /><br />That being said, this apparently is an important film, because people are talking and that is ultimately what every film hopes to achieve. Yet!! Remember something. Many of the antidotes and messages portrayed are products of keen editing and conjecture by a democrat. Films are illusions and Fahrenheit 9.11 is plain and simple propaganda.<br /><br />Because President Bush sat thinking in front of a classroom of children after being told of the attack on New York. We're supposed to believe there is something wrong with that? What is he Superman? Supposed to spring up and run out of the room? CHILDREN!! Would any normal person not think about how to carefully walk this line sitting in front of a classroom of children?  Yet, the movie spins a different tale, VOICED OVER by Michael Moore who TELLS US what Bush is THINKING!!<br /><br />Osama Bin Laden's family was flown out of the country despite all planes being grounded. What's the assumption here? How about looking at the real truth. Bin Laden's family denounced Osama long ago. They are peaceful people and after what happened, they feared for their lives, rightfully so. Besides, the FAA has since stated that there is no record of this flight or any other.<br /><br />Bush knows the Bin Laden family. So what? Wealthy people like the Bushs, the Bin Ladens, the Kerrys and the rest of our politicians make up about 2% of the worlds population. Is it so shocking and scandalous that they know each other?<br /><br />Politicians putting on makeup for the camera... uh... that's normal. Anybody who knows anything about T.V. would know that. Cheap shot.<br /><br />Another cheap shot was showing the video of the people of Iraq, playing and shopping before the war. Awful? Yes. Sad? Yes. War is awful, but I'm sure you could have seen the very same thing in Germany before WW2.  Was removing Hitler wrong?<br /><br />Is it wrong that security was guarding the Saudi Arabian embassy? Maybe if it were a tank, or a S.W.A.T. team, but one guy!!  Come on Michael!!<br /><br />Documentaries in their truest form are UNBIASED and tell us stories with CAMERA, not with VOICE OVER. Moore took his video and talked over it, inputting his own biased democratic opinion.<br /><br />Bush meeting with Al Queda before 9.11 is called a President's job. Presidents meet with all leaders and heads of states at various times for various reasons. Clinton had many cordial visits with Yassar Arafat, does that make him a member of Hamas?<br /><br />Ever heard the phrase: \\"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer\\"?<br /><br />Michael Moore took stock video of Bush and others in these meeting and subjectively inserted his own words.<br /><br />The best moments of the movie were when he let the camera speak for itself. Like when the politician admitted that they never read entire bills before passing them, or when he asked politicians about enlisting their sons. That's documentary film making!  Unfortunately, most of Fahrenheit 9.11 is Michael Moore voice over propaganda.<br /><br />A true documentary would have also told the story of the Priest and his congregation that went to Iraq to protest before everything happened. When he got there, he was faced with an onslaught of Iraqi's who told him gruesome stories of the things that Saddam had done to the people of Iraq, and they wanted to know when we were coming to remove him. He promptly returned to the U.S. with a publicly changed mind.<br /><br />Moore proved something though. The power of film is great. You can show images and voice over nearly an entire film with your opinions and many many people will believe everything you say.<br /><br />In my opinion, treat 9.11 like today's biased network newscasts. Make sure you know which network your watching and don't believe everythingyou hear.<br /><br />If you truly want to get a view of the FACTS behind Fahrenheit 9.11, watch it, but also watch FahrenHYPE 9.11. Another documentary that shows how much of Michael Moore's speel was based on lies and baseless information.<br /><br />Finally, if any democrats came out of watching Fahrenheit 9.11 and thought that members of their own party were immune to the same shifty government practices and BIG MONEY favoritism, think again!  Both parties are guilty of these things and if you think otherwise... YOU'RE A FOOL.<br /><br />I was sort of a fan of Michael Moore before 9.11. But, after watching this, I have lost all respect for him. He has ABUSED his power, disgraced our military and has at numerous times in this film, lied about things to suit his agenda, or maybe JUST DIDN'T DO HIS HOMEWORK, and that to me is irresponsible and unforgiveable.<br /><br />Moore should be excited about one thing though, apparently Osama Bin Laden has now seen his movie... and has given it two thumbs up.11.

B000001EL3|5.0|Well, I've been on a Kiss kick here lately, so I couldn't pass up the chance to review \\"Destroyer\\"! After the surprise massive success of \\"Alive!\\" the year prior, 1976 marked the arrival of this album and \\"Rock And Roll Over\\" which found Kiss at their creative peak.<br /><br />\\"Destroyer\\" pushed the envelope at the time in terms of experimentation, and proved without a doubt that they could experiment with various things and gain new fans while satisfying their hardcore fan base at the same time; no easy feat by any stretch of the imagination!<br /><br />There isn't a bad song on this album; every one is a remarkable achievement. Beginning with the charging guitars of \\"Detroit Rock City\\" (complete with the devastating car crash sounds at the end) to the sublime orchestration of \\"Beth\\" to the angelic choirs on \\"Great Expectations\\", Kiss leaves almost no stone unturned.<br /><br />Some of the standout tracks are the great \\"Flaming Youth\\", \\"Do You Love Me?\\", \\"King Of The Night Time World\\" (my personal favorite), and Gene Simmons' ode to S&M, \\"Sweet Pain\\". It wasn't until several years ago that I learned Ace Frehley did not play the nasal-sounding guitar solos on \\"Sweet Pain\\"; they were played by Dick Wagner, who was the guitarist for Alice Cooper. I thought at the time that Ace was experimenting with different guitar sounds!<br /><br />As I often like to say, you can't go wrong with this CD! Pick it up if you haven't already!
0316168815|5.0|Review 1: \\"The Lovely Bones\\" <br /> <br /> The book The Lovely Bones is a wonderful coming of age novel.  It is an exceptional story of a young girl and the tragedy that turns her world upside-down.  The main character in the story is a young fourteen year old girl named Susie Salmon (like the fish).  The story takes an unpleasant turn when Susie is rapped and murdered, by someone you would have never guessed.  But, don't think that I will give that away in this review you will just have to read the book for yourself.  This was before milk carton photos and public service announcements, she tells us; back in 1973, when Susie mysteriously disappears.  She is speaking from heaven and tries to contact her friends and family.  Become part of this young girls struggle to find out who she is and how she must grow up. The author Alice Seabold goes on to tell of Susie's struggles to let her family and friends live on without her.  She knows she has hurt them all so very much, but there is nothing that she can do but stand there and watch them from her heaven.  Susie describes her heaven as her \\"comfort zone\\" a place that has everything she needs and that makes her happy.  However, Heaven is lacking her most valuable possession; her family.  With love, longing, and a growing understanding, Susie watches her family as they cope with their grief and begin the difficult process of healing.   <br /> This book was an incredible novel.  It was an unbelievable story that moved my heart and made me value my life completely.  It makes one assess the significance of growing up and the life that we as humans sometimes take for granted. This book will be sure to teach you to live each day at time and to live for the moment.  If you are looking for a page grabber that keeps your eyes glued to the pages with mystery and excitement this book is for you.  This book was a complete success!  I feel thankful for the chance to have read such a different book.  It was a very inspirational book,one that makes the reader truly think.   This book is tearjerker that tells the enormous journey of a girl form earth to heaven and back again from a different perspective.  It was amazing! <br />
B000001ELF|5.0|By this time, the division bell was already ringing behind the scenes within the Kiss camp, and nothing made the fact more evident that the cookie was crumbling than when Gene, Paul, Ace & Peter released solo albums simultaneously. This also coincided with their movie debut in the made-for-TV disaster \\"Kiss Meets The Phantom Of The Park\\" shown on NBC in October, 1978.<br /><br />Frustrated with the direction that Kiss was headed in at the time as well as with his limited role in the band, Ace Frehley clearly had a statement to make, and he did it with a vengeance on his solo album. Ace's was by far the best of the four albums and definitely rocked the hardest!<br /><br />With the snarling, rabid guitar intro of \\"Rip It Out\\", Ace wastes no time in getting right up in your face to let you know how pi**ed off he is by letting loose with some strong vocals. From this point right through to the end, Ace goes straight for the jugular and doesn't let up a bit.<br /><br />My personal favorite is the echo-laden \\"I'm In Need Of Love\\", where Ace spits out his vocals like venom and in my opinion, unleashes his greatest and most powerful guitar solo since the live version of \\"Shock Me\\" on Alive II.<br /><br />You can clearly hear all the way around just how inspired and motivated Ace was, and this trend continued on even into Kiss' 1979 \\"Dynasty\\" album, the first for the band after regrouping. But shortly thereafter, it was clear to Ace that he would never be completely happy within the confines of Kiss, and thus began the chain of events leading up to his departure in 1982.<br /><br />Every track is a winner here, including several odes to Ace's lifestyle (\\"Ozone\\", \\"Wiped Out\\", \\"Snow Blind\\"), and ends with the great instrumental \\"Fractured Mirror\\", one of the first tracks to contain the use of a guitar synthesizer.<br /><br />This is Ace's finest hour...for some excellent rock & roll, look no further than this!
B00003CY6M|5.0|Review 3:  Movie \\"Serendipity\\" <br /> Do you believe in love? Do you believe in Fate? That everything happens for a reason?  This film brings out elements of all of these questions.  The movie Serendipity is an exceptional picture.  The irresistible casting of John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale highlights this predictable romantic comedy.  It all started a few years ago, when New Yorker Jonathan meets the British beauty Sara. Cuscack & Beckinsale play a couple of New Yorkers who accidentally meet up one night.  They share a few perfect hours together before parting ways, leaving future encounters to Sara's peculiar obsession with fate.  Due to a sequence of unlikely events, they are separated and go their separate ways.  A few years later, they are about to marry their respective fiancs and urgently hoping for destiny to bring them back together.  Luckily fate brings back this insane duo, and suddenly it is love at first sight. <br />This movie is incredibly romantic.  My boyfriend said that this movie reminded him of me.  If people only knew how much fate and destiny truly had to do with our lives, maybe some would make smarter choices.  This movie tends to make one long and hope for the type of love that these two people are looking and longing for.  In the end they finally find each other and the type of love they both had been desperately searching for.  If you are looking for a movie that is going to take you into a crazy unexpected spell with romantic twists this movie is for you.  It is a laugh out loud comedy as well as the most romantic movie of the year.  I would give the movie five stars.  The acting is incredible by all.  Believe me, it is worth seeing! <br />Reviews Like/Dislike...After reading all of the eighteen reviews I have much debated the idea if reviews do indeed help people.  I have come to the conclusion that not all reviews are helpful or even a pleasure to read.  Some reviews are distasteful as well as unwanted.  However, I feel that many people do truly look at whether or not the more highly sought out give the movie/book/music two thumbs up.  In other words they are important. <br />First of all for example, the book reviews were much more positively written.  I found this to be very helpful.  The book I sought out was The Lovely Bones.  When looking for a book to read one may look at the simple things of how long it is or who the author is.  But most often others look for the reviews on the piece of writing, whether the majority are good or bad and if bad if it was based solely on opinion or if the subject was rather drab.  If one reads more reviews on how the book was bad than one will probably choose not to read this book.  Thus, they will spend some more time trying to find a book that has more of a positive review.  I think that book reviews are far more important than the music and movie reviews.  The reason that I feel this way is primarily because listening to music or watching a movie is far easier and thus takes up significantly less time than reading a book.  Therefore I find that most people will look at the book reviews far more closely than the movie and music reviews.   <br />Second, the music reviews weren't very helpful.  I studied reviews for Sara McLauchlan.  These reviews were very broad and basically cynical as well as pessimistic. For this reason I did not enjoy reading the six of these.  I was amazed.  They were all short and critical of her as an artist.  Only a select few had nice things to say about the artists.  I was very surprised.  I found myself wondering where all of the fans of these artists were.  If the only critics reviewing these artists were negative, I couldn't quite grasp this concept.  It just didn't seem right.  I wondered how these critics could critique the world's musicians this way when they don't even know what it takes to be a musician.  I was flabbergasted.   <br />Lastly, the movie reviews tended to be about half and half, equal.  I researched the movie\\"Serendipity.\\" The reviews weren't all disagreements or arguing with the artists or authors.  Some were very positive and others were negative.  I thought that they balanced each other very well.  This was what I had expected originally.  I thought that the majority would have been responses/reviews going both ways.  This was something that I thought to be a very good quality.  It gives the reader a few reviews in like or dislike of the movie.  I liked reading all of the different opinions of all of the critics.  It was helpful and intriguing.   One of the reviews was wonderful it described the movie just as I would have described it.  It stated that it was a fun and romantic comedy that makes fate and destiny a huge part of our lives.  It makes one wonder what life holds in store for us.  This review was great mainly because it did its job; it made me want to watch the movie again.  There were a few reviews that I found to be sort of surprising they were for the movie Serendipity.  They stated that they movie was stupid and awful.  This I found hard to believe because it is my favorite movie.   Most of the reviews were good but some really second guessed the director and these reviewers hated the movie. <br />
B0006213WG|2.0|<br />   It would be very easy to come up with a silly pun involving the album title \\"Chuck\\" and the word \\"suck.\\"  But I'm above that.  Instead I'll use the word \\"Chuck\\" itself, as in:  \\" Sum 41's new album is called \\"Chuck\\" which is exactly what I did after about 20 minutes of this crap.\\"  The music itself isn't that bad. Unfortunately most songs sound the same, with some minor changes.  They did some little double-timed, palm-muted riffs to show off that they really do know metal music, but they're just metal cliches.  This is still pop-punk.  What really drove me crazy about this album was the lyrics.  Every song sounds like it was written using a self-help book, a rhyming dictionary, and some cut and paste work.  None of the songs have any real meaning.  They're all just filler.  Not one outright, direct statement about anything.  Like for example, \\"Think before you make your mind up/ You don't seem to realize/I can do this on my own/ And if I fall I'll take it all/ It's so easy after all.\\" There's not one point in all of that, and that's a chorus for chrissake's. Especially unforgiveable since there's supposed to be a message behind this album.  If you want to hear good metal/punk music with a message, listen to Boy Sets Fire, or even Red Tape. If you want meaningless drivel written without much effort or heart, you should buy this.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Review 2:  Music \\"Sarah McLachlan\\" <br />The music by Sarah McLachlan is enchanting and extraordinary.  I am constantly amazed each and every time I listen to her music.  My favorite piece of her work is Surfacing this is the title of her first piece of music.  I have since fallen in love with everything that this artist has recorded.  Everyone has some sort of music that they like to listen to when they are angry or upset and of course in between.  This is the perfect type of music for all kinds of moods.  I find myself dumbfounded when one of her songs comes on the radio or I hear it off in the distance.  There is something about the sound of her voice.  Her tone is very moderate and serene just enough to give one complete piece of mind.  It is the type of music that can give complete and utter piece.  This music is also romantic in all types of ways.  Some of Sarah McLachlan's greatest hits are Angel, which is a reflection of people receiving second chances and going up to heaven.  Make no mistake about it: This is a landmark album. It's close to flawless in terms of the production. This is also a subtle concept album, which travels the places of the heart in ways that surprise, frighten, and comfort its listener. Small details surface with each listen; for example, the song \\"Fear\\" ends with the lines, \\"But I fear I have nothing to give... I have so much to lose.\\" Then, the next song begins with the line, \\"All the fear has left me now...\\"  This album will definitely grow on you, with each patient listen.  I noticed that the guitar playing and rhythms on this album are very exquisite.  I love the many modulations and echoes that Sarah's voice moves through.  She also shows that she is comfortable in a variety of musical settings.\\"  If you are looking for a peaceful yet stimulating and romantic album Sarah McLachlan's music hits the spot.  You will wonder what you were listening to before.  This album is a definite must have because it will offer comfort to every willing listener. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It seems this movie is lost on a lot of folks. It is a good hearted film with well written characters and talented acting.<br /><br />  The humor is very obvious at times and subtle at others. I thought that the actors had great timing with thier movements and speech.(like the way Uncle Rico tosses his napkin before he says, \\"I dumped her.\\")<br /><br />  I also think that there are some great themes in the movie that people miss. Like, follow your heart, be a good friend, find your soulmate.<br /><br /> Also, I enjoyed the PG rating. It was great to see a very funny movie that I could recomend to anybody.<br /><br /> Not for everybody...but, if you have not seen it, give it a shot.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Although it may have competition from it's 1984 counterpart \\"Terminator\\" as a movie about a human cyborg, 1987's science fiction classic \\"Robocop\\" is an extraordinary achievement in sci-fi like almost nothing before then.<br /><br /> Starring Peter Weller and Set in future Detroit, crime is spiraling out of control with massive drug gangs evolving from just mere street gangs into violent predatory militant organizations that are terrorizing the city population, a policeman named Murphy (first name?) has been tracking down a violent drug cartel and his thugs with the help of a fellow officer (Nancy Allen) they reach into an abandoned industrial complex, the lair of a corporate criminal named Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith from That 70s Show) and his vicious gang. The bust however goes horribly sour and Murphy is brutally gunned down and left for dead by the gang he faced off against. His body is partially-saved and what parts of his body that they saved is integrated into a state-of-the-art robotic humanoid machine, part of his humanity restored, and now in his `new life' Murphy is resurrected as Robocop, a new state of the art weapon against crime in Detroit and is now ready to fight the explosion in crime throughout Detroit and hunt down the killer who `killed' him before then. Now Robocop is out to revolutionize the war on crime and protect the citizens of Detroit.<br /><br /> \\"Robocop\\" is without a doubt one of the best action movies of the 1980s and while parts of it do show it's age, it is still quite an impressive movie to watch today, a full 17 years after it was released. I can actually remember although vaguely actually seeing this at the theatre and enjoying it. The special effects are really amazing even by 1987 standards and the whole concept of humans being built into mechanical humanoid machines, while far-fetched is something worth thinking about even if it's on the border of being impossible.<br /><br /> The movie however is incredibly violent so parents should strongly caution their kids about watching this as well as it's two sequels. The scene of officer Murphy meeting his `first end' is very bloody and one of the most disturbing scenes I've ever watched (I do have a tendency to be a little sensitive towards scenes of cops being killed). One scene however towards the end which I'm not going to mention out of fear of spoiling it however is one of the best `bad guy meets his end' scenes ever filmed.<br /><br /> This is a must-have movie for those who love action movies as well as sci-fi but be warned that it is a rather graphically violent film that younger kids should not be allowed to watch without parental supervision.iolent so parents should strongly caution their kids about watching this as well as it's two sequels.

B00000D9TQ|4.0|When you think about it the 1980's was a terrific decade for popular music.  I would compare it to the sixties.  There were so many creative forces at work and pop music was vibrant and a lot of fun.  When I think of the eighties I think of Phil Collins.  He was not only churning out hit after hit as a solo artist but he was also hitting the charts on a regular basis as the lead singer of Genesis.  And it seemed that every time you turned on the TV there was Phil performing his latest hit.  He was everywhere and to be honest the unlikeliest of rock stars.<br /><br />Atlantic Records released \\"Phil Collins.....Hits\\" back in 1998.  And in spite of the fact that another new 2 disc collection was released in 2004 if you are primarily interested in his biggest hits then this is still by far your best buy. I particularly enjoyed Phil's upbeat pop offerings like \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"Sussidio\\", \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and perhaps my favorite tune of the decade \\"Easy Lover\\".  You'll also find #1 tunes like \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", \\"Against All Odds\\" as well as the highly annoying \\"One More Night\\".  How I hated that song!!!!  Am I the only one?  Then there is the unlikely remake of the 1966 hit \\"Groovy Kind of Love\\". Phil managed to take that one all the way to the top of the charts in fall of 1988. Speaking of remakes I also enjoyed Phil's version of the Cindy Lauper hit \\"True Colors\\".  In fact, I think it is far better than the original.  I also wanted to make you aware that a couple of Phil's biggest hits were left off this disc including 1985's \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" and one of his last big chart hits \\"Do You Remember?<br /><br />This is a fine collection of one of the seminal artists of the 1980's.  However, I stopped short of a five star rating due to the complete lack of any meaningful liner notes.  Instead of the usual 8 or 12 page booklet Atlantic instead chose to make this a fold out mini poster. Some may enjoy it but it does nothing for me.  But in spite of this shortcoming I am certain that pop music buffs will enjoy this disc.  Recommended.hat pop music buffs will enjoy this disc.  Recommended.

From Compass International Pictures.<br />First film in the series.<br /><br />Choice of Widescreen or Full Screen.<br /><br />Halloween (1978) is the all-time classic horror film and it still works.  It will scare the goosebumps off of you.  We all remember Janet Leigh (who passed away October 3, 2004) from the Alfred Hitchcock film, [[ASIN:B003IWZ1D8 Psycho (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]] (1960).  Her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis (also of Tony Curtis)  is the star of Halloween (1978) in this her first film.<br />  John Carpenter was a struggling filmmaker who made this film on a budget of $320,000. For an independent film, it became the most successful released independent film ever made.  They shot the film in 4 weeks for 20 days. The art of suspense, dark shadows, sound, close-up shots, building the story, ultimate surprise and the emotional acting of the actors all make this horror film the greatest scary film ever.<br />  Jamie Lee Curtis plays a high school student, &#34;Laurie Stode&#34;.  There is a stalker, Michael Myers, in the neighborhood.  He killed as a child in 1963, was sent to a mental hospital, escaped as an adult, and is now out to kill again in the same neighborhood.  Michael is a stalker, voyeur, and a cold-blooded killer.  It is Laurie he is truly after.  While Laurie is babysitting two young children on Halloween night, Michael gets his real chance.<br />  This film is the all-time favorite to watch on Halloween night, but due to its effectiveness, it is NOT FOR CHILDREN TO SEE.  There are scenes of sexual situations, female nudity, as well as, intense-violence.<br /><br />  Also in the cast: Donald Pleasence, Nancy Stephens, Nancy Loomis, P.J. Soles, Charles Cyphers, Kyle Richards, Brian Andrews, John Michael Graham, Arthur Malet, Mickey Yablans, Brent Le Page, Adam Hollander, Robert Phalen, Sandy Johnson, David Kyle, and Peter Griffith.<br />  Nick Castle played &#34;Michael Myers&#34;, Tony Moran also plays &#34;Michael Myers&#34; as his face is revealed.

B000002AH9|5.0|Some people hate the strings recordings from Billie Holiday. I love this recordings with the arrangements of Ray Ellis. Most songs where perfect for Billie's voice. Only the last one didn't fit with her. But al over the result is smathing.I thank God I changed the LP with this CD.There were countless clicks in the Lp.
B0002VL0KQ|1.0|How much more can this woman sell out?<br /><br />Chrysler commercials, tacky Vegas act and now Anne Geddes?!?!<br /><br />Celine has zero credibility in the music industry. What's next? McDonald's commercials or \\"Eat At Joe's\\" plastered to her back?
B0002OERI0|5.0|before i get on with my reivew i would like to say something to the idiot who reviewed this cd, tyler nelson. Greenday is not punk! and never will be! second, thinking for yourself is the complete opposite then hating bush to fit in. YOU ARE A MORON!  <br />  Now on with the review. This is a great cd from one of the best bands of our time. it contians some classic sounding greenday songs like, American idiot, shes a rebel, and st jimmy. However, with american idiot they take there sound to an all new level. from inidie rock on Extrordinar girl, to folk rock on Bolivard of broken dreams.  <br /> Another added feature on this cd is that it is a rock operah. Now many bands have tried this and in my opinion only two have been successful, these being The Who, and Pink floyd. Now i think a band is on the way Green Day will go down in history thanks to this cd as one of the greatest bands of all time.  <br />
B00003CXA3|5.0|Let's just get the plot synopsis out of the way: Popeye Doyle and Cloudy Russo are to NYPD detectives who make the largest heroin bust of their time.  As the title implies, heroin is being smuggled in by a prominent Frenchman and sold through middlemen in Manhattan.  Doyle and Russo do an amazing job of tracking down the bad guys, but unfortunately, the bad guys still claim somewhat of a victory in the end. The movie's based on a true story, but of course, many liberties are taken. Alright, that's that. <br /> <br />This is simply one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Gene Hackman never topped himself with his Oscar-winning performance as Popeye Doyle.  He's able to channel the obsessiveness, harshness, and faux racism of the actual person he's based on so genuinely that you wouldn't doubt that he's an actual hardened detective. Roy Scheider does an outstanding job as Popeye's sidekick Cloudy. He plays Cloudy a bit more mellow than Popeye, but you can tell that he's just as good a cop as his partner. The cast also includes Fernando Rey who turns in a great performance as the French villain. <br /> <br />Of course, the acting is superb, but the cinematography and the action are equally great.  Since Friedkin wanted the movie shot in a documentary style, the on-screen action takes on a very realistic appearance.  This enhances our appreciation of the New York that is seldom portrayed - the non-5th-avenue, real, heroin-infested backstreets of the 60's.  And, yes of course, one of the greatest chases in the history of movies - Popeye in a car chasing the French hitman who's on a train.  There's no CGI here.  And as you'll learn from the commentaries, the crashes you see are real since the filmmakers didn't bother to obtain permits to shoot on the streets and instead just stole the shots. <br /> <br />That brings me to the DVD extras. The commentary by director Friedkin is excellent.  It really gave me a new appreciation for this movie.   Friedkin talks at lengthabout the 2 detectives the main characters are based on, the difficulties in making the movie, and probably most interesting to a film fanatic, the correlations between the movie and the actual case itself.  The commentaries by Hackman and Scheider are also great, but unfortunately, each only speak for about 20-30 minutes. The DVD also has an insightful documentary produced by the BBC about the movie and the actual case. <br /> <br />I'm sorry I'm talking so long, but there's still more to say. There are seven 7 deleted scenes and accompanying commentaries on the DVD. After viewing these, I realized just how revolutionary the ideas behind this movie actually were. The final cut of the movie was controversial enough in its portrayals of drug use, police behavior, and Popeye's racist attitudes, but one look at the deleted scenes will convince you that Friedkin would have pushed the envelope farther if only audiences were ready for it. The most striking of the scenes depicts the French hitman enjoying sadomasochistic activities with a prostitute. That may be par for the course for today's movies, but just imagine what it would have been like back then. <br /> <br />I've rambled enough, but it's only because I love this movie and this DVD. Make sure you pick it up next time you go to Blockbuster or wherever.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|M. Bernocchi's review from Old Windsor is bang on: \\"Blues Deluxe\\" is fantastic!  That the title track is an old Rod Stewart tune from back when he mattered makes the British review all the more tasty.  And about that track: in the midst of an album packed wall-to-wall with excellence, Bonamassa's guitar work in \\"Blues Deluxe\\" takes the back seat to no player.  When you hit the 4 minute mark, your hair will light on fire and your synapses will melt as Joe explodes into incendiary brilliance.  Be careful if you play it in your car.  Hide the children if you crank it up at home.  Joe Bonamassa now has a chair at the table of the masters and that smile in your soul is testiment to his excellence.

B00005JMH2|5.0|I hope everyone will see this movie.It's uplifting and fun. <br />   Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere danced beautifully together. <br />   Miramax Films has taken an endearing story(foreign release,1997)and keep the heart of the original storyline intact. <br />   Director,Masayuki Suo,did a superb job as screenwriter and director of the Japanese film. The cinematography as well as editing were equally grand.The majority of those who have seen this version give compliments to the quality of this film. <br />   Director,Peter Chelsom,has paid homage to Masayuki Suo,by keeping true to the messages he was trying to convey. As did Screenwriter:Audrey Wells.The cinematography and editing of the U.S version (2004) are equally superb... <br />
0380789019|5.0|I see that 437 others have reviewed this, so I'll leave the description and reasoning to them and just add my five stars and my encouragement. This book made me look at the subways with much different, much fonder eyes... and it made me look harder at the world, too. It's the sort of book that does that to you. It's the BEST kind of book, that can make you see very normal, every-day things in such a new and exciting light.
0754003663|2.0|I loved this BOOK and would give it 5 stars.     The audio book, though, is very disappointing.  The reader uses voices for the characters that are silly.  The voice she uses for Hero Wantage, the woman protagonist, is high and squeaky, and the voice she uses for the male protagonist, Lord Sherringham, is loud and affected.  Also, the narration bits are rather low volume, where the conversational bits are very loud.  It's hard to get the volume set right to get both parts without getting a headache.      Too bad the Audio Edition is so poor, since it's a wonderful book.
0380789035|2.0|I'm sure this would have all made a lot more sense if I were, say, a specialist on gods throughout all cultures all over the world during every time period ever studied by man.<br /><br />However, I am not.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the main character was underdeveloped, the story was drawn out in painfully pointless details and scenes, and the climax was utterly pointless, especuially in light of the ending.<br /><br />Ultimately, I found the book to be well-written but not my style.<br /><br />Read \\"Neverwhere\\" if you really want something fun. This just lacks color.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|First, I'd like to say that this story line was everything I could've asked for. It started off ending the possible love theme, and carried out an intense action film where Bourne truly lives up to his training and experience in evasion and ingenious. However, I thought the camera work was confusing. I rated it 5 stars due to the great story line, acting performances, and suspense, but the camera work was absolutely frustrating. I couldn't tell who was who in the fight scene where Bourne went to the house of the last remaining partner in Treadstone, and the blurred frames and changing camera angles every second were completely unnecessary. I realize this is a \\"fast-paced action film\\", but I like to be able to see what's going on. I can't wait for The Bourne Ultimatum, but I can only hope the camera work is like it was in The Bourne Identity.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|It's odd to think what sort of changes Star Trek has brought to our world. Only now are we realizing that concepts like antimatter, space and time travel, multiverses, parallel dimensions are in actuality possibilities that really exist. This DVD set is a classic, as are the other two seasons of the original. Make sure to check out The Next Generation and for a wild ride Deep Space Nine.
0780619609|3.0|I'd really like to give this movie 5 stars because I love and have loved the ninja turtles since they came out in the late 80's. The movie is well done, the costumes look better in the second movie then they do in both the first and the third movie, and the overall tone of the movie is upbeat. <br /> <br />However there are several glaring flaws that caused me to wonder if the editors were sleeping when this movie was on the cutting room floor. <br /> <br />Things like their bandanas kept getting caught up under the spot where the turtle heads went over the neck on the costume. Costume malfunction? Constantly. Also there are SEVERAL scenes where they would have weapons strapped to their backs, then they wouldn't have them, then they'd have them again. I mean come on, what kind of ninjas would go into battle without their weapons? And at the end...when Shredder dumps the ooze on himself and mutates into SuperShredder....why in the world did his armor and clothes mutate also? (besides the fact that someone thought it would look 'cool'?) <br /> <br />Overall, the scripts were done well, even Ernie Rayes did a good job as Keno, AND did his own fighting sequences. Casey isn't in this one, we can only assume he's goongalla gone for a while...maybe he went back up to that house in the first one?  <br /> <br />Two of the turtles voices are the same, Leo and Donny. Raph has a different actor in each movie, and Donny....only because Corey Feldman was working out his cocaine issues. His voice actor was good still, and I rather liked it better then Corey's voice, though Corey's voice was much more distinctive. And Leonardo's voice actor is the same guy who voiced Bunji from the Bionic Six cartoon (anyone remember that one?) <br /> <br />And don't forget to watch out for cameos by three of the four turtle actors. In order...Mikey is the guy with the snooty wife that talks to April outside her apartment \\"You're that newslady...\\" Leonardo is the foot who says something like \\"the junkyard was our fallback spot\\", and Donatello is the guy in April's newroom who's saying there is a phone call from the guy who \\"says his name's Donny...\\"  <br /> <br />But I ramble. As I said before...I'd love to give this movie a 5, it being my favorite of the three movies, even though I will always be a fan of the NT comics moreso and would like to see a fourth movie done in true martial arts style, dark and angsty....like the comics. But... this movie was cute and very cartoony and great to watch with your kids. A good buy.
630575067X|3.0|Getting straight to the point, This film is beautifully CGI rendered and has moved the goal posts of how modern day films are made. <br />It has some exciting moments and the best sword fight in movie history so far but ultimately lacks substence. It is poorly acted, the computer effects are too much at times and has a storyline that will baffle most people. One of the main characters in the film, Jar Jar Binks, is one of the most ruinous aspects overall because of his Disney-like stupid, incoherent nature. I genuinely cringe whenever he opens his mouth. Another huge dissapointment was the lack of screen time or dialogue for the new bad guy Darth Maul with only three lines in the film and they're short. The Podracer sequence is over-hyped but is still an impressive moment none the less. The lightsaber fight at the end is worth buying this fim for. It is very dramatic with stupendous choreography and brilliant use of camera angles to capture the peril of the scenes. <br />Overall the film has it's ups and downs but you must see it at least once. Preferably twice to try and get the plot sorted out in you mind. It makes much more sense that way. Possibly Rent First

B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney Spears' 3rd album is good, but uneven in some places.  The first half is funky and edgy with songs like I'm A Slave For You, Boys, Overprotected and others.  But the second half sounds too '80s like.  Cinderella sounds too Bon Jovi like, Bombastic Love would have sounded good in 1986, and the Wade Robson and Justin Timberlake produced offerings are lame and sound like rejects from her '99 debut. Her I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman is a pretty, gorgeous ballad--sounds like she's lived it in the lyrics, despite the Dido-songwriting assist. Her offerings with Rodney Jerkins and Neptunes give the Max Martin and Kierulf/Schwartz songs some stiff competition.  But it is not her best album; she seems lost in some of the production and music of the songs. Sometimes the music is louder than Spears' voice, what with the heavy beats and basslines. And as for her calling this her most mature album, it isn't--that belongs to her 4th, In The Zone. This album just saw Britney struggling to stay afloat against the competition--it's really missing something, lacks the pizazz of Britney's first two albums.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I give this album four stars because it is an excellent metal and Maiden album, but not one I would say merits the utmost honor and rating.  First of all as a Maiden album BNW is different than others. If you like Maiden's early, middle and later periods (Iron Maiden and Killers, Number of the Beast through Seventh Son and Fear of the Dark to the present) or a combination of those then I would suggest this album.  If you only like a few Maiden songs, this would not be your best bet.  Go look for Rock in Rio.  Secondly, if it is not obvious Maiden has evolved, whether in your opinion for better of for worse.  This means this album cannot easily be compared with other Maiden albums, but maybe songs.  I will use Maiden songs as a breakdown for comparison (except songs from Dance of Death, too easy).  <br /> <br />The Wickerman- Great album opener, bass is obvious, catchy, simple chorus.  Anthem like.  Compare it to The Evil That Men Do. <br /> <br />Ghost of The Navigator- Another great song, builds and culminates in a nice breakdown into the chorus, catchy riffs, biting. Compare it to The Fugitive. <br /> <br />Brave New World- Slow, melodic start, builds rather slowly, sad almost poignantly, heavier than most on this album.  Compare it to Fear of the Dark. <br /> <br />Blood Brothers- Orchestral accompaniment, slower, melodic as well, simple chorus, nice ending solos and vocal harmonies.  Compare it to Infinite Dreams. <br /> <br />The Mercenary- Great track, fast-paced, basic verse/chorus/solo/bridge pattern, shredding solos, great sing-a-long.  Compare it to The Trooper. <br /> <br />Dream of Mirrors- slower, longer, heavy breakdown with killer solos and vocals, takes longer to fully enjoy.  Compare it to The Clansman. <br /> <br />The Fallen Angel- Very heavy, crunching, like Mercenary in style, but opposite in speed and rhythm, good middle track.  Compare it to Caught Somewhere in Time. <br /> <br />The Nomad- long, repetitive, deep/low/slower, melodic solo section with orchestration in middle (rather cool).  Compare it to To Tame A Land. <br /> <br />Out of The Silent Planet- more up-beat, builds nicely, great chorus and opening break to verse, awesome guitar work (harmonies, solos, and obvious three parts).  Compare it to  <br />Two Minutes To Midnight. <br /> <br />The Thin Line Between Love and Hate- Crushing, slower, optimistic, nice vocal range show off for Bruce, very melodic and slow almost acoustical seeming at end.  Compare it to Still Life. <br /> <br />Overall great album if you like Maiden a lot, if you don't wait a little.  If you have Maiden albums from early and later periods this is most likely the best from their last four studio albums.  If your a new fan get one of the first two albums, Number of the beast, Powerslave, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son before Brave New World.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Crime author Dennis Lehane extended genre boundaries with Mystic river. A drama exploring the repercussions that crimes against children have in their adult lives. There is actually no mystery as to why this meaty novel, brimming with tragic characters, attracted top-flight talent in director: clint eastwood for their commitment. <br />As kids, Jimmy, sean and fave ran together in a workingclass Boston neighborhood, until the afternoon their young lives are ripped apart by the actions of paedophiles. 30 years later, the three have pretty gone their own way. Jimmy is a devoted husband, Sean is a detective and Dave is a family man. When Jimmy's daughter is murdered, three old friends are reunited as Jimmy swears for vengeance. DAve is under suspicion. <br /> <br />This movie is incredibly gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat. You can see the emotion which bring actors like sean penn bursting out. very beleivable acting and makes the film more powerfull. The other cast members also contributed to this.  <br /> <br />This movie is such a good movie and a near masterpiece.  <br /> <br />MYSTIC RIVER is powerful, painful and deserving of its praise as one of 2003s best movies
B00005JMJG|5.0|ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is as original and fascinating as anything Charlie Kaufman has written previously. Kaufman has the ability to take a tiny thought/idea and trace it through the minds of his characters much like the way synapses propel sensory input.  And in doing so he provides more intelligent insights about personality variations and relationships and the vulnerability and neediness of contemporary man than just about any person writing scripts today.  This is 21st Century existentialism delivered in the most cogent manner.<br /><br />But the story would be only half told were it not for director Michel Gondry and his enormously gifted cast of characters:  Jim Carrey finally demonstrates his innate thespian gifts with the role of Joel, a laid back, fearful, needy cookie-cutter piece of a man who finally finds someone who loves him in goofy Clementine (the always superb Kate Winslet) only to have the 'business' of memory erasing (run by Dr. Miarzwiak - Tom Wilkinson - assisted by his technicians Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood) destroy his new found happiness and drive him to the same extreme that drove Clementine to have their memories of each other erased.  Despite the apparent linear storyline this film begins to act like the confusion of electrical stimuli to brain cells and for the remainder of the the movie we are not sure how the idea is playing out until the magic ending which is so fine that it should be withheld from those who have not experienced this film.  This is cinema of the first rank, up there in the echelon of Resnais, Fellini, Almodovar and others who have been practitioneers of the bizarre yet wholly committed art of mind manipulation.  This film may take some work from you, may require a couple of watchings, but it is time well spent.  Let's hope there are more collaborations between Kaufman and Gondry - and even this cast - in the future!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, I bought the STAR WARS Trilogy DVD and I just got through watching all the movies, special features, commentaries, etc. And it was lots and lots of fun.  <br /> <br />The image and sound quality are top notch, of course. These movies no doubt look and sound better here than they ever have before.  <br /> <br />As for the changes made by George Lucas: they're jarring, but most of them I think I will get used to. A few tweaks here and there aren't really all that bad -- I like the shots of the different planets celebrating at the end of RETURN, along with the new music that replaces that awful Ewok chant, and it's nice to finally get to meet Biggs right before the big attack on the Death Star. I'm even beginning to accept the addition of Hayden Christensen as Annikin alongside Obi-Wan and Yoda at the end of RETURN. And I don't mind the original bug-eyed Emperor in EMPIRE being replaced by Ian McDiarmid, because he didn't match the character in RETURN anyway. (One thing I still can't figure out -- why does there seem to be a crudely-drawn black spot next to the Emperor's right eye during his final scenes in RETURN? It looks as though it's masking something, but what?) <br /> <br />Some of the additions were unnecessary -- I really didn't need to actually see a hand-puppetty-looking worm coming out of that hole that Boba Fett falls into on Tattooine during the scene on Jabba's barge. Nor does seeing a herd of Banthas, or stormtroopers riding around on digital beasts, add anything to my enjoyment of the movies. Most of it is just George Lucas' irritating tendency to forever tinker around with his creations. However -- <br /> <br />Some of the changes that particularly irritated me are: <br /> <br />1. Greedo still shoots first, although they made the time between his shot and Han's shot shorter -- but who cares? I liked Han better when he just pre-emptively shot first. That totally fits his character at the time. <br />2. The scene where Jabba confronts Han beforethe Millenium Falcon takes off is all wrong. Jabba always struck me as a creature who is naturally too huge and bloated to be very mobile -- as in RETURN, where he lounges authoritatively in one spot and everything and everyone comes to HIM -- and it just looks dumb to see him bopping around like this.  <br />3. The rebel fighters heading toward the Death Star are digital now. I liked the old ones. George -- I LIKE seeing how the FX guys conquered challenges using the resources available at the time and managed to produce great effects that STILL LOOK GOOD. <br />4. Boba Fett's voice is now the voice of the actor who plays Jango Fett in CLONES. So how come the stormtroopers don't all sound like him too? <br />5. The dancers performing for Jabba the Hut do a digital song-and-dance sequence now. It's pretty bad -- like something out of a third-rate Pixar movie. <br /> <br />I'm sure I'll think of some others later, but you get the idea. The changes are there, and we're stuck with them, so we might as well get used to them. Although this is why I wish the DVD's came with both the original versions and the \\"special\\" editions.  <br /> <br />The commentaries are pretty interesting for the most part. Lucas, Dennis Muren, sound designer Ben Burtt, and Carrie Fisher appear on all three, with the addition of director Irvin Kershner on EMPIRE. There aren't many dead spots, but that's mainly because Burtt goes on and on about how he obtained various sounds from dumpster lids, movie projectors, and whatnot. It's interesting in small doses, but he goes on about it too much during scenes where I would like to hear commentary from Lucas or Muren. Kershner is a genial old guy who seems genuinely enthusiastic about his part in the STAR WARS saga and it's fun to listen to him, even though a lot of his commentary is simply him excitedly telling us what's going on as it happens. Fisher pops in now and then with a few anecdotes.  <br /> <br />Lucas' commentary contributions, of course, are the most substantive, yet he frequently made me want to throw things at him with his constant griping about how unsatisfied he was with various shots and how this or that could've been done better digitally. Before it was over I was thoroughly sick and tired of the word \\"digital.\\" I feel that, like myself, a lot of the people watching these movies, who have loved them for decades, are entirely content with the way they look and how the FX artists of the time were able to solve certain problems and present incredible special effects that, as I said before, STILL LOOK GOOD even after the advent of CGI and other advanced techniques. I wanted to hear how these movies were made, not how much better they could have been made today. Lucas, however, seems totally oblivious to this and often speaks in a regretful tone during the commentary, which is a real turn-off. He just doesn't seem to get the fact that these movies are so popular because of what they are, not because of what they could have been. <br /> <br />As for the additional disc of special features, there's a wonderful documentary about the STAR WARS saga that lasts around two-and-a-half hours. There are also three featurettes of interest, especially the one which features the likes of Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and Peter Jackson talking about the effect STAR WARS has had on them. In addition to the usual trailers, TV spots, etc., there's a preview of Episode III that shows Hayden Christensen and Ewen MacGregor practising what promises to be a major lightsaber dual between their characters, and the construction of a new Darth Vader costume. The video game preview is interesting too, and contains more of Christensen going through his moves for the benefit of the game designers.  <br /> <br />An Easter egg which can be found on the \\"Video Games And Still Galleries\\" menu features some outtakes along with the DVD credits. It's not very long and it seems as though more of this material could have been dug up forthe DVD. (You can access it by punching in \\"11\\", which activates a light next to R2-D2, then \\"3\\", and then \\"8\\".) The still galleries contain photos from the discarded sequence in which Luke hangs out with his friend Biggs Darklighter at Tosche Station in Anchorhead (surprisingly, Koo Stark was in this scene as well) which makes one wonder why Lucas couldn't have included these scenes on the special features disc as well. One possible reason is the fact that a special, SPECIAL set of all six films is already being planned and they're saving stuff like that for it. Which means, I guess, that I'm going to miss out on it because there's no way I'm buying these movies AGAIN. <br /> <br />Well, that's my disjointed review of the new STAR WARS DVD set. All in all, despite its flaws, it's definitely well worth having and is a huge amount of fun for the Star Wars fan. <br /> <br />
B0002VKZL6|4.0|I consider Knopfler the only guitarist that can still make the overused Stratocaster tone sound interesting.  That said, I've only sporatically liked his own work, and I usually prefer his music when he's backing someone else like Steely Dan or Dylan.  Shangri La proves to be an exception.  The songwriting is very solid and strikes a great balance between blues rock and Knopfler's recent British folk interests.  The consistancy rate is high enough that I can't really pick out highlights.  I want to hear the whole album when I put it on, and my attention span is sometimes a little short.
1565847032|4.0|Few other books could offer such an accessible and wide-ranging critique of US foreign policy and corporate capitalism. The interview format allows for an ease of reading often lacking in other texts with similar themes. In particular, the idea of placing the book's 500 pages or so of footnotes on the Web (rather than in the book) provides a factual basis to Chomsky's arguments without rendering the book an impossibly heavy tome. <br />Despite my overall admiration of the book, I have a couple of minor objections. First, Chomsky continually attacks or dismisses European 'intellectuals' (like Althusser, Derrida, Marx etc) but could probably benefit from engaging with their works at some level. Writers like Foucault have demonstrated eloquently how power and control are exerted not merely by corporations and governments, but by science, education, and mental health, topics that Chomksy largely does not address in this book. Also, like all too many social scientists, Chomsky seems to suffer from a degree of 'physics envy', whereby he sees physics as the 'ideal' model of science, and argues that political analysis (and other disciplines) should look to physics for methodology when attempting to present their 'proofs'. This notion is patently false, and whilst Chomsky is correct in asserting that much theorising that occurs from non-empirical standpoints (such as that done by European intellectuals) is utter claptrap, he runs the risk of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and pre-emptively dismissing potentially valuable ideas, such as those regarding ideology, for example. <br />Nonetheless, these are relatively minor quibbles in what is an otherwise outstanding introduction to a critical perspective on US gorvernment, corporations, and media. That Chomsky continually refers his arguments to concrete facts makes this book's political agenda particularly potent: one can disagree with Chomsky's arguments, but one cannot disagree with the death tolls for Haiti, or for the destruction of unions in America. Even the most thoroughly indoctrinated capitalist apologist would be hard-pressed to refute his or her way out of the facts and arguments contained in this book.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|How can I describe this album... I've had it for months and I still listen to it every day. It's without a doubt one of my top three albums of all time.  <br />The first song I heard was \\"Paper Bag\\", I was instantly swallowed in by the incredibly laissez faire mood of the song. So relaxing and fun to sway to.  <br />\\"Fast As You Can\\" (the album's first single), takes you through a fast, groovin' track ripe with emotion, then breaks into a down-toned interlude with the most beautiful vocal work I've ever heard before it pulls you back into its chaotic groove.  <br />\\"I Know\\" is relaxation in its purest form. This song suits any time of day, any mood, any weather. This song is for everyone. The piano just washes away every care and worry.  <br /> <br />There's no point in my describing the rest of the album because I know all of you would enjoy it. Did you like \\"Tidal\\"? I'm 100% sure you'll find \\"When the pawn...\\" a PERFECT sequel to it.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|The breakout movie for the 80's brat pack is one with many teenage issues  <br />that can still be attributed with teens today. John Hughes' signature film  <br />focuses on the harshness of high school social groups and how they affect people,  <br />especially the teens who don't really know who they are yet.  <br />\\"The Breakfast Club,\\" is a movie that brings together 5 socially different  <br />teens from fictitious Shermer High School, based on Hughes' high school  <br />Glenbrook North in north suburban Chicago. The movie is about these students during  <br />an all-day Saturday detention and their struggles with authority and accepting  <br />one another. At the beginning of the day, they are given an assignment to  <br />explain who they thought they were. And by talking to each other and baring their  <br />souls, they realize, they are what everyone see's them as, and that it doesn't  <br />matter what anyone else thinks, as long as they are happy. As said before,  <br />all these students come from a different social group; each filling a  <br />stereotypical role; the popular girl, the jock, the rebel, the nerd and the  <br />weirdo. <br />All while sitting through detention, they realize how similar they are,  <br />despite their obvious differences. Each of these teens are trying to figure out  <br />who they are, all while trying to prove themselves in the eyes of those most  <br />critical of them (parents, teachers, friends, coaches, etc.) By spending one magical day together, they learn and grow close through experiences and talking, even though they would never talk to each other normally. As the film winds down, you can't help but wonder if this would ever happen in real life. As much as the fantasy of movie life is intriguing, you know  ti can't be real. And the movie gives false hope to the thought that judgmental teenagers will all get along and work through their problems. But who said a little fantasy is a bad thing. Thinking of one's own high school experience brings back the memories of the cliques and social groups that were there, and this is the movie that defined each group in a high school.  <br />Some of the issues that are brought to attention in the film are drug abuse,  <br />parental divorce, peer pressure, and attempted suicide. Each of these issues  <br />can still be and are easily issues that are present today among teens. As seen in the film, high school is stressful enough, but with outside pressure and forces it can make it the hardest time in anyone's life. This movie not only described teenage angst in one generation, it defined it for all  <br />teenagers at any time.  <br /> This movie is a great reference point for high school. Granted it has since been spoofed for its generalizations and full story line, it is still an 80's classic. If you have not seen it it comes highly recommended. \\"The Breakfast Club,\\" is a great movie, but just don't take my word for it, see it for yourself! <br />
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Hands-down, this is the best concert DVD I've ever seen. Every aspect is perfect. The sound is gorgeous ... I love the mix, whether in 5.1 or stereo. The performances are perfect and inspired (there are none of the usual 'flavor of the week' acts that typically show up at tribute concerts, not out of respect or friendship with the deceased, but rather because some manager decided it would be a good career move). Eric Clapton did it right by holding weeks of rehearsals and forming a core band that anchored the musical procedings. Finally, the camera work and direction really make you feel as if you are there. The shots are steady and long. No jerky movements, no quick cuts for the sake of 'art'. <br /> <br />This is one DVD you will treasure for a long, long time.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|In this introductory effort by newcomer Gavin Degraw, he has nailed it! By  <br />trying to stick to the genre of laid back and easygoing music, Degraw has done  <br />what he set out to do. Each song on this full CD was easy to listen to, and  <br />had great new melodies and good lyrics.  <br />On the first track, \\"Follow Through,\\" Degraw get right down to the point by  <br />saying, \\"this is the start of something new/don't you agree.\\" You can't help but smile and nod because it is something new and exciting. His music is new and different and sets himself apart from from others such as Jack Johnson and John Mayer. By being his own  <br />critic, Degraw points out that his music is not some cookie-cutter piece of  <br />musicianship. On the track, \\"I don't wanna be..\\" Degraw let's critics and fans  <br />alike know that he will not give into the ever popular sellout artist. By  <br />saying, \\"I don't wanna be anything other than what I've been trying to be  <br />lately/All I have to do is think of me and I have piece of mind\\" <br />Each song shows more and more emotion, as Degraw has said that his music is  <br />based on his personal experiences. The soulful lyrics and range of Degraw's  <br />talent adds to the content of the cd, making the listener want to hear just what  <br />treat is coming up next. On the track, \\"Just Friends,\\" the listener can almost feel the emotion of the song in Degraw's voice.  Every word sung evokes a feeling in the listener that cannot be ignored. By putting into words the emotion felt by unrequited love, Degraw has nailed the feelings of anguish and hopelessness along with anger and quiet desperation. <br />Gavin Degraw's style can be described as a laid back John Mayer type, with  <br />the uniqueness of indie rocker Ben Kweller, with the instrumental talent as good as Dave Matthew's Band.  As you can only describe a band with comparisons to another, it has to be said that despite the comparisons, Degraw sets himself apart from them. His style is unique, yet familiar, comfortable but modern, interesting but impressive. The poetry and the flow of the wordsmake the listener want to sing along at all times. The melody, the words, the beat: all of it is good and nothing on the cd was a disappointment.  <br />If your in the mood for an easy listen with soulful and poetic lyrics, look  <br />no further than Gavin Degraw's \\"Stripped.\\"  For somber moods, happy moods, angry feelings and just plain frustration, the emotions in this cd are for anyone at any point in their lives. If Gavin Degraw continues to make efforts that are half as good as this one, we can expect great things from this artist. <br />
1590866347|5.0|Mitch Albom was a student at Brandeis University in the late 1970s, who had a sociology professor named Morrie Schwartz. In 1994, Albom saw Schwartz on Ted Koppel's Nightline, talking about his struggle with Lou Gehrig's disease. Albom was then a sports columnist for the Detroit Free Press and he decided to visit Schwartz in Boston every week until the older man died. Their dialogue is the subject of this audio book where Schwartz shares his regrets, feelings, insights and appreciation for life. The audio also provides a vivid record of the teacher's battle with muscle-wasting amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease and all of its side effects.
B000024C7W|5.0|This album is so incredibly beautiful it brought me to tears when I heard it the first time.  <br /> <br />It is absolutely an album that you HAVE to sit down and listen to all the way through...you can't just pick songs. Start at \\"Earth's Creation\\" and go all the way to \\"Finale\\". You will be taken on a trip through the history of life on Earth, and you will be enlightened with insight into a true visionary's mind. <br /> <br />The entire album is one long song, it has recurring musical themes that are presented in the introduction and conclusion, as well as their positions in the core of the work. This album is so well planned that if you listen to it from beginning to end you will be absolutely mesmerized. <br /> <br />A couple favorite songs: <br /> <br />Come Back as a Flower - Gorgeous. Incredible. Beyond words. <br />The Secret Life of Plants - Simple and powerful. Sums up everything marvelously. <br />...also Outside My Window, Send One Your Love, and Ecclesiastes. <br /> <br />This is the most powerful album I've ever been exposed to. I have given numerous copies of this to people in times of need, or even just as friendly presents. <br /> <br />I strongly advise you to buy this, sit down with it and just listen from beginning to end. You will walk away refreshed and with a completely different outlook than you had when you sat down.
B0002TSZK6|1.0|Moore proves he's a liar and a dangerous one at that. There are an unbelievable number of mistruths, half-truths and bold-faced lies in this mislabeled \\"documentary\\". It is amazing anyone can believe it. If you were a fool enough to view this garbage, at least do yourself a favor and view \\"FarenHYPE 9/11\\" for an explanation of the whole truth of what really happened and how Moore lied to us. I am ashamed for Moore in that he has marketed this film as a documentary and that so many people seem to have been fooled into believing it. \\"Peter Pan\\" is closer to the truth than Moore is.

B00005JNEU|5.0|One of my friends saw the film last night (she is a so-so BBT fan, having loved \\"Sling Blade\\", but thinks BB hasn't topped it yet).  She liked \\"Friday Night Lights\\" OK, but thought her overall disappointment in the film was due to it being much too hyped by the media.<br /><br />No surprise that my reaction was the opposite.  I though FNL was an even better film that I expected.<br /><br />This true story would have lost something if it had been written as fiction I think.  Script writers seem to be driven to make life even out.<br /><br />The idea that what the viewer is seeing is 'reality' lends grit and substance to this story of Odessa and the town's obsession with football in this highlighted year of what is a very long history.<br /><br />There are so many issues brought to light and the issues themselves offer so many varied sides to the facts, it leaves the viewer with much to ponder and certainly with mixed emotions and reactions.<br /><br />One thing I was definitely not conflicted about was Billy Bob's performance.  It was sterling.  To all the nay-sayers who I have heard say, \\"he always just plays himself\\", this year alone should point out the error of this belief.  He was: Davy Crockett, a frontiersman; Willie, a unique Santa Claus; and Gray Gaines, a true southern high-school coach.  Is Billy Bob actually all these people?  Perhaps now it will come clear to many new fans, he only 'seems' to be portraying himself because he is such a tremendous talent he totally makes the viewer believe he IS the character.<br /><br />This film was very well cast all around.  Tim McGraw (and I am not a TM fan, so I can appreciate talent other than because of my obvious bias when it comes to BB) was excellent.  I have to admit, I kept picturing Dwight Yoakam in the role, but that didn't distract me from recognizing the acting talent of Tim.  Who would have ever thought it?  Much the same way Dwight emerged as a fine actor in \\"Sling Blade\\", McGraw revealed a side of his creativity we have never before seen.<br /><br />Lucas Black (Mike Winchell) was a true find as a young actor ('Sling Blade' and 'Crazy in Alabama')  and he continues to grow in his craft.  In his easy acting ability, he reminds me of a young Billy Bob.  Garrett Hedlund (Don Billingsley) and Derek Luke (Boobie Miles) were extremely well-cast and did amazing work.  Grover Coulson, not a well established actor by any means, was very believable as Boobie's uncle L.V.<br /><br />I am so thrilled for Billy Bob's continued growth in his film career and that he is finally getting high-profile film roles and the respect of the film makers.  The down side is that I miss seeing Rick Dial, Brent Briscoe, and other familiar faces from Billy Bob's movies.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\", as BB has mentioned in interviews, was filmed in a more chaotic, kenetic style than most of his films, but it was perfectly suited to the subject.  The awesome vintage cars were great to look at and lent a real air of reality to the actual era of the film.  The music, while not my favorite genre and not true to the time of the story (at least by my recollections) did, much like the photographic style, definitely match the flavor of the film.<br /><br />I have heard FNL compared to 'Hoosiers' numerous times.  I liked 'Hoosiers' very much, but I thought 'Friday Night Lights' was a far superior film in all aspects from casting, photography, editing, and storyline, to performances.  This is a touching story that makes you care about the town, the game, the coach, and most of all the kids living these stress-filled lives as the heros of their misquided town carrying tremendous responsibility under the guise of young folks have fun.  My emotions were stimulated from the opening scenes to the ending updates about these real-live-characters.<br /><br />While much of FNL was bold and in-your-face football action, there were subtle moments as well.  Coach Gaines' look and 'kissed-fingers' relayed to his wife after the game definitely spoke volumes, but not near as much as the total relief expressed so loud and clear in the subtle, easy, sweet smile of Mike Winchell when he finally realized that the weight of eight years of playing the game of youth football was finally behind him and he could face the challenges of living his 'real life', which in comparison surely felt like it would be 'child's play'.<br /><br />I predict this classy film will a classic sport flick in much the same way \\"Bad Santa\\" will become a classic cult Christmas movie.  Of course Billy Bob is going to be in our minds and hearts for years to come as his body of work, as well as his fan base, continues to grow.t not near as much as the total relief expressed so loud and clear in the subtle, easy, sweet smile of Mike Winchell when he finally realized that the weight of eight years of playing the game of youth football was finally behind him and he could face the challenges of living his 'real life', which in comparison surely felt like it would be 'child's play'. <br />I predict this classy film will a classic sport flick in much the same way \\"Bad Santa\\" will become a classic cult Christmas movie.

B00005JMAH|3.0|I've read some of the other reviews -- some are thrilled by this film, others think it failed badly.  My votes falls on the \\"failed badly\\" side.  First, the character development is poor.  Granted, and as noted, Warners chose to compress a long book into a watchable movie.  However, the HP books transport readers and there multiple levels of detail in the simplest things (and shows why JK Rowling is a fantastic writer).  Here, a lot of character elements are simply not brought out.  For example, the growing tension between Ron & Hermione does not exist (this will become important in later books, so it creative license CANNOT take it out).  Ron & Hermione are simply non-entities; they fill the scenes, but they have no depth at all.  Unlike some reviewers, I thought the new Dumbledore was very disappointing.  Richard Harris offered a twinkle in his eye and he served as a warm, understanding mentor.  If you've read the books, Dumbledore is irreverant, all powerful, but very protective and understanding mentor to Harry.  I felt that Richard Harris captured the spirit of Dumbledore very well.  Here, the new Dumbledore doesn't offer that sort of character at all.  He is in scenes, but he doesn't seem to convey any emotion.  His glances and gestures do not suggest \\"warm, irreverant, powerful\\"... they suggest nothing beyond that he fills scenes (much like Ron & Hermione).  I must admit, however, that Lupin's relationship to Harry is very strong.  On that mark, the director got it right, and the actors pulled off the scenes well.  I can go on and on... <br /> <br />Visually, this film has taken a VERY different approach than the previous films.  For example, the color scheme (muted, dull grey), the \\"darkness\\" of the film, the wardrobe, Hogwarts locations, etc., have all changed dramatically.  It's not subtle.  There is NO warmth in the film.  In the first 2 films, there are a lot of scenes that convey warmth.  There is NO warmth in this film at all.  The books are going to get darker, colder, and more serious.  This film leaves very little room for further \\"coldness\\" because it is so dramatically different, both in tone, palette, and style.  I also do not like the fact that the kids do not wear robes, Dumbledore wears simple robes, etc.  Part of being \\"transported\\" into the world of Harry Potter (the world JK Rowling has created) is their DIFFERENCES, not their similarities.  They wear robes while at school, not Levi's.  This is one little quibble, but if you add up all of the subtle changes, they add up to a very DIFFERENT film than the prior films and, perhaps more importantly, the books.  The film simply does not seem true to JK Rowling's vision. <br /> <br />Anyway, for what it is worth, I will likely buy the DVD for my collection because I like the books a lot, but it really does the Harry Potter world, and fans such as myself, a disservice.  I give 3 stars because I am a fan.  If I were not a fan, I would give it 2 stars. <br /> <br />Word to Warner Bros: extend each of the future films into two segments like the Lord of the Rings.  Business-wise, this makes sense because you now have a GUARANTEED audience for TWO films, not just one.  It will do service to the books, to JK Rowling's vision, and to the fans.
B00009RDGA|4.0|I remember watching this movie as a little boy, at the end of my moms bed late at, and even then i was drawn in to it's story. I don't remember a lot of it, but i am ordering this DVD really soon.It's very sad to hear that the real life father and Daughter relationship was not as loving and clse as the movie.
B00000K19E|5.0|Ah yes, the classic Matrix.  You can truly call this movie one of the most influencial movies of the past ten years, dazzling all with it's amazing special effects, its amazing plot and top notch action sequences.  Now that all three movies are finished and released on DVD, I thought I'd take an in-depth look at all three movies and how they work together. <br /> <br />My experience with the Matrix did not really begin until the third movie was released on DVD.  I decided to see what everyone was talking about and find out what this whole Matrix thingy was.  When I first saw the Matrix on DVD, I was stunned.  The movie presented a plot that was very Sci-Fi, yet at the same time there was a horrible possibility that it was entirly possible.  If a movie makes you question your own reality, then its bound to be a pretty influencial movie.   <br /> <br />The things that stuck with me the most after watching the movie for the first time was the action and the enormously cool agents.  But after watching the movie multiple times I've come to appreciate little things.  How the crew of the Neb is a small collective group of people from different backgrounds come together for a common cause.  How we can identify with Cypher, because lets face it, the Matrix is a lot nicer then the cold hard real world.  I also liked how Neo eventually accepted who he was and what he could do (interesting fact:  Neo does not say anything over five lines long until the end of the movie).  The action sequences are of course top notch and hold up quite well five years later, except that the sentinels look a bit plain and cheap.   <br /> <br />The Matrix will probably be remembered as the start of one of the hottest debated trilogies in movie history (Along with the Star wars prequels).  On its own, its an incredibly good movie that's well worth seeing.
B0006213WG|5.0|their best album, no hesitation! <br />no more pop/rock radio, 90% of the album is metal/metalpunk , voices are heavy and guitars plays fast and loud..... <br />a very good work was done on this album and it deserve to be listened
B00005JNEI|1.0|I will start off by saying that I am not a fan of Michael Moore's. That being said I felt that this film was pure sensationalism from a disingenuous film maker. Fahrenheit 9/11 is a one sided self serving film from a man who thrives on calling himself a political activist. Mr. Moore is often times misinformed and blinded by his dislike of President Bush. With Fahrenheit 9/11 Michael Moore has 2 uncensored hours to force feed us out of context statements and his own political commentary.  <br /> <br />After seeing this film the only questions on my mind were, how can I belive what I just saw from a man who openly critises the President of the United States any chance he has and what about the other side of the story? All of the reasearch for this film seems to have been done with one intention and that was to subject viewers to Mr. Moore's views and not on the facts of what happened. <br /> <br />Michael Moore should be congratulated, not because the film opened my eyes to the world but because the film served one purpose his own. Mr. Moore made a bundle of money with this bit of propoganda. If you enjoy fantasy and sensationalism this is your movie!
6305499365|4.0|<br /> \\"Office Space\\" gives a hilarious point of view of a cubical office job where one day you just get sick of working all together. After working over time, getting less respect and less recognition, Peter Gibbons decides he will take no more of it. This movie really will make anyone laugh their socks off let alone those who actually have cubical jobs that they go to everyday. <br /> Ron Livingston and Jennifer Aniston make a great couple in the movie and even add a short love story to the plot, although never really hinting at even loving each other. Stephen Root and Gary Cole bring out your stereotypical roles of the \\"nerd\\" and the \\"foreign co-worker\\" which adds more comedy to the everyday workplace. Peter (Ron Livingston) does a great job of portraying what many cubical workers really want to do, just stop working and caring about their job. This movie does a terrific job of creating a comical view of an everyday office job and anyone that has ever worked any job can relate and have a ball watching it. <br /> This movie is definitely one that can not really be compared to any other movie. You have to go out and see it for yourself. This type of \\"office comedy\\" can be extremely funny when used as it is in \\"Office Space\\" and no movie duplicates it. <br />A movie like this could be compared somewhat to the comic \\"Dilbert\\" since one of the characters in the movie is actually based of the comic. The character Milton plays the role of the nerd in the office and does a good job of being the one who is always overlooked and criticized. Milton, although he doesn't play a very important role in the movie adds a great sense of office comedy to the plot. <br />\\"Office Space\\" is a great movie and although it is for a mature audience many families can still enjoy it together. I can watch this movie over and over again and I think it will really stand the test of time. You will love \\"Office Space\\" and every hint of office comedy that people see everyday. <br /> <br />
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|This is one of the best concert dvds I have ever purchased. This band has so much life in them as well as the fans, you will literally get off your seat and sing along to it if you're a fan. The power metal kings never disappoint. The quality and sound is perfect, the setlist has been varied from battalions of fear to night at the opera. Extras include a documentary the making of the festival, featuring stage setup, rehersal and camping grounds/the fans. There is also a pretty long interview with the band, sadly its all in deutsch but there are subtitles. Then there is additional concert footage from Wacken festival, and Sttutgart. I give it a 5, this is definatly worth a look at for any metal fan of all genres .
B00005JNEI|5.0|(...)    For forty years I've wished to God a constitutional way existed, to REQUIRE qualified children of those serving in our Congress (and White House, preferably) to be sent to war before anyone else's children.  IT WOULD PUT A STOP TO MILITARY ADVENTURISM AND UNNECESSARY WARS TOMORROW.  AND FOREVER.    George W. Bush, like every other U.S. President since WWII is very adept at sending other people's kids to fight and die in a needless war; I guarantee Congress would not have given Bush the war powers they did, had they been required to send their own kids first.    Kudos to Michael Moore for pointing this out to the American people.
B000003TBP|5.0|Odelay is a hiphop high watermark of the nineties. Beck's vision of folk meets hip hop is fully realised and seameless. This is one of the most essential, influential albums of recent years; see  Everlast, eels etc. The rhymes are ironic wordplay art and even the samples are original Beck even samples Bob Dylan on Jackass. If you want emotion and more oblique songwriting see Beck's more recent work if you want a brilliant album listen to this.
B000002UAX|5.0|First off .. a lot of these &quot;reviews&quot; are just plain silly!  Someone complained about the fact that &quot;Paint It Black&quot; isn't on this album .. that is a ROLLING STONES song .. and gave &quot;The Beatles&quot; a one-star rating for that reason.  Is that dumb or what?!<br />This album goes to show why the Beatles have to be one of the most respected bands of all time.  Sure, they could have put out poppish sounding records again and again (I want to Hold Your Hand, She Loves You, you know, all the 1964 and previous stuff) and made even more money that way, but they wanted to experiment and change the way music was made.  In a way, you could say that they were an &quot;alternative&quot; band way before that whole genre even started in the 90s.  I respect bands and artists who are willing to try something a bit different without regard for their recording being considered commercial!  Thank you &quot;Fab Four&quot; for this album!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|<br />Big Fish <br /> This movie, by Tim Burton is by far one of his best. I have enjoyed most of Tim Burton's movies in the past such as, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Edward Scissorhands; so when I saw the commercials for Big Fish I was instantly drawn in. Not to mention, Ewan McGregor is in it, so I was in love instantly! When I saw this movie, I was not disappointed and that is obvious because I saw Big Fish in theatres three times while it was there and the day it came out on DVD, I bought it.  <br /> The movie is the story of a young man named Will (Billy Crudup) whose father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying. They had not spoke for a few years after Will's father took the spotlight at his wedding telling one of his outrageous tales. Now, while is father is lying in bed at home, Will who has grown up being told the many miraculous stories and tales of his fathers life, wants to find out the truth about all of the stories. Will does not believe that any of the stories that his father told him throughout his whole life are true and he feels he does not know who is father really is. As the stories and the movie unfold, Will learns more about his father and himself, as well as the reasons for the stories that his father told. <br />The movie goes back and forth between the present, and the stories being told as back-flashes. Young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) is the center of all the tall tales that include a witch with a glass eye that shows how people die, a perfect little town called Spectre with no road to it and even a giant named Karl. Each story is told with Tim Burton's usual sense of imagination, sensational imagery and darkness. The stories all revolve around events that happened in Edward Bloom's life, but each tale in the movie reflect a real tall tale.  <br /> The actor's in this movie are all wonderful at the parts they portray. Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young, charismatic Edward Bloom. Albert Finney makes the old Edward Bloom glow, even though he is sick in bed most of the time. The contrast between the two actors as young and old is perfect. Jessica Lange as Will's mother and Alison Lohman as a young Sandra Bloom are also wonderful in this movie. The casting in this movie was amazing and adds a lot to the rest of the movie as a whole.  <br />Although Big Fish is a wonderful spectacle to see, I don't recommend watching it while you are tired because then it will seem a little slow. Believe it or not, I watched it once when I was tired and actually fell asleep. Every once in awhile there are parts that seem to kind of drag. That is made up for, however, in the great storyline and the colorful imagination and display of each story. I recommend this movie to be seen by everyone at least once and bring a box of Kleenex for the first time. Big Fish is a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and genders. Since there is very little profanity and slight, but tasteful, nudity, this is a good family film and one that I even thought was appropriate to watch at a church youth group event. If you love Tim Burton's older movies, you will definitely love this one. Even if you didn't love his other movies, I still recommend everyone to rent this movie and see this outstanding spectacle at least once. <br />
B0000C0FJB|5.0|This is the definitive (I think) live album by one of the greatest prog rock bands ever...RUSH of course!  This spans over three discs and is over three hours of kick butt live rush in Rio!  All their big hits like Freewill, Tom Sawyer, Limelight, 2112, etc are here and more!  It's just astounding to here such an epic preformance. <br /> <br />Now the only downside to this is that the sound quality is not the best.  There were some bad weather conditions during the preformance which could have cause that.  Plus there wasn't any in studio remixing.  It just makes it sound more authentic, like you were there in the mass croud, screaming for more Rush and yelling when they play your favourite song, and singing along, etc.  If you like Rush and want to have a cheaper experience than paying for a ticket.  Get this!

B0002J4X1Q|5.0|Blood flows and the Dead walk and chomp in Paul W.S. Anderson's charnel house of a videogame-to-movie zombie opus \\"Resident Evil\\", a hyper-kinetic, supremely stylish, super cool barrage of living Dead and corporate wickedness.<br /><br />Instead of plowing its profits and R&D budget into detergents and oven cleaners, the nasty Umbrella Corporation has built itself a big bad virological bug. But as go the best laid plans of mice and men, the Big Bad Bug gets out into the uber-secret underground laboratory/think-tank/weapons factory that is the Hive, and the Hive's super-genius super-computer called the Red Queen gets all twitchy, snuffing all hands on board---with extreme prejudice.<br /><br />The fun is just getting started. Cut to former shiny-happy Umbrella Corporation employee Alice (played tastily by actress-model-singer Milla Jovovich) waking up in the shower of a mansion with no memory as to how she got there. Not to worry, as she soon has plenty of company: a crack-squad of commandos sent in to do a by-the-numbers infiltration: get in, shut down the psychotic Red Queen, get out. Simplicity itself, right?<br /><br />Dead wrong. Everybody in the Hive is dead---but they just don't seem to want to stay down. Slaughter, high-style, ample blood and goop, and a note-perfect Marilyn Manson score ensues, and our marines have to look sharp or find themselves turned into zombie chewtoys.<br /><br />If you're looking for insanely high style, zombie chewing goodness, some nice scares, a good workout for your home entertainment system, model-actress-singer Milla Jovovich in a torn mini-skirt kicking wire-fu butt against undead Doberman pinschers, and all of this served up with a generous side-order of the Red Sauce---well, brothers and sisters, you've come to the right flick! Make sure the safety's off your 9mm Ruger, sling the double barreled shotgun at combat ready---that's you, Soldier!---and let's head deep into the zombie-haunted hallways of the Hive.<br /><br />Zombie purists were concerned when original director, and zombie Grand-Master, George Romero turned the reins over to Paul Anderson, who had a choppy directorial resume: he had previously helmed the lackluster \\"Soldier\\" and the grisly if silly space-opera gruefest \\"Event Horizon\\". They need not have fretted; from the opening credits to the apocalytpic coda, Anderson proves a master stylist, working with cinematographer Dave Johnson (who worked with Anderson on \\"Alien versus Predator\\") to deliver ample zombie-chewing fun with a tight editing technique that serves up the carnage with a mix of brutality and flair.<br /><br />The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James \\"One\\" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the digusting \\"Licker\\".<br /><br />But look, the real delight here is the way Paul Anderson, cinematographer Johnson, and composer Marilyn Manson all work together to play out their gory magic on a palette of silence. Can you beat the scene where the Red Queen is first shut down, the blast doors all slide open, and there is that palpable hiss against the tomb-like quiet of the Hive---and then the groans of the shuffling, shambling, *very* hungry dead? Or when, after a second's reprieve, the survivors cower in a control room from an undead bio-engineered abomination, hungry to get in, pounding at a bulkhead blast-door? The movie is at its best when it is a series of gorgeous shifts from dead quiet to blood-thirsty crescendo.<br /><br />The Hive and its environs are so brilliantly executed that Anderson effectively creates another character in the set-pieces alone, from the parquet and marble digs of the Mansion to the sleek, techno-sexy sterility of the Hive, to the goth-industrial Road-to-Nowhere that is the train---all of this adds to the horror and frame the desperation of our heroes as they war against the Living Dead (the train station and Hive Entrance being an actual underground system in Berlin!). Few films manage to bring everything together like \\"Resident Evil\\", and Anderson is to be commended in making it all work out in spades.<br /><br />Finally, kudos to Anderson's team for mixing up effective CGI with animatronics: in the last few years, horror directors have taken the easy road with cheap computer-generated effects, and happily Anderson opts for tastily gory animatronic models that give beasties like the \\"Licker\\" the respect they deserve.<br /><br />A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completists, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson.<br /><br />The billion dollar question, of course, is---is \\"Resident Evil\\" scary? Imagine being locked up in the wilderland of the cubicle with flesh hungry co-workers, armed only with your wits and a 9mm automatic. You tell me, Soldier---you tell me.r?

B000001XO3|5.0|The virtues of this Ring have been analyzed to death.  No more of that.  The sound is adequate, and rather better than that of the comparable Furtwaengler set.  The cast is astonishingly good.  No opera house in the world today could come close to matching it.<br /><br />By all means, acquire Rings produced more recently and play them for your friends who are deaf to anything but mere sonic reproduction.  Listen to this one on your own, and hear for yourself what Wagner's Ring is all about.  Just one among many glorious sequences, the big awakening scene at the end of \\"Siegfried\\" with Varnay and Windgassen will take your breath away.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is a very good CD from an excellent band.  Christina Scabbia's voice is amazing and she fits effortlessly with the music, which is outstanding.  What I love about this CD is that all of the songs are outstanding and the two singels aren't the best on the album (which is always a plus). <br /> <br />A few of the reviewers were disappointed, but I think it's because they read too much into the hype.  Everyone seems to compare Lacuna Coil to Evanescence.  Sure, both bands are gothic metal bands with a female lead singer but so are Darkwell, Lullacry, Nightwish, and Flowing Tears.  All of these bands are very different from each other (some may not be as gothic, but you see my point).  One reviewer mentioned that this music wasn't heavy, it just sounded like nu-metal.  The problem with the \\"heavy\\" label is that when a lot of people hear it, they start thinking of Slayer and other such metal bands.  Lacuna Coil is VERY much not that kind of metal.  As for the nu-metal classification, I can't really argue for or against that because everyone has their own definition of \\"nu-metal\\", so it kind of loses all meaning, just like \\"alternative\\" did.  The most common definition of nu-metal that I'd heard was the whole rap/rock thing, which Lacuna Coil doesn't do at all. <br /> <br />Everyone is entitled to their opinion of this CD.  Personally I love it, I've heard it too many times to count, I never tire of it.  Don't listen to anyone who claims this band ripped off Evanescence or vice versa, though.  One band came from Italy, one from Arkansas.  They are in the same genre but are different bands.  I love Evanescence as well, so I recommend this CD in addition to their CD and if you like Evenescence, you will probably like this.
0060245867|5.0|This book, written by Laura Joffe Numeroff, is a story about a greedy little mouse and a very generous young boy.  When the polite young boy offers a cute little mouse a cookie, it naturally asks for a glass of milk to go with it, and then he takes the boy on a ride for all he's worth.  The mouse wants milk, a straw, scissors, a place to sleep crayons and many other things.  The young boy, trying to be a good host, grants all of the mouse's requests, and just when he thinks the mouse is finished, he asks for a glass of milk. Oh no... here we go again. <br /> With its graphic and colorful illustrations from Felicia Bond, this book was, and still is an instant hit.  Written in 1985 \\"If you give a mouse a cookie\\" became a favorite among children of all ages.  Every page contains illustrations which are brightly colored and keep the reader interested.  Even the end pages are a bright blue color and invite the reader in and welcome them to enjoy the book.  The text is simple and the story is easy to follow.  The only problem is, the story leaves you kind of hungry.  By the way.... do you have a cookie? <br />
B0002OXVDW|5.0|As a fan of the MGM musicals, I have always loved all three THAT'S ENTERAINMENT! films, especially the first (because it started the resurgence in love for these films), and the third (because it was so innovative and creative in taking us behind the scenes). I've owned them on VHS, I've owned them on LASER DISC, but this new Warner DVD boxed set puts everything that has come before it to shame! <br /> <br />The new 16x9 widescreen transfers are stunning! The colors jump off the screen and the clarity is dazzling. <br /> <br />The 5.1 surround sound is equally amazing. It envelops you! <br /> <br />Best of all is the incredible assemblage of extras Warner has brought forth for the bonus disc TREASURES FROM THE VAULT. You get amazing documentaries (many not seen in years or brand new), vintage TV specials, and 17 additional OUTTAKE MUSICAL NUMBERS that were not included in the original MGM features. What a treat! <br /> <br />It's obvious this package was put together with a great deal of care and passion. Long live the MGM musical, and thanks to this DVD set, that mantra can be a reality!
B00000DGUY|5.0|This is the best compilation album ever! I liked 11 out of 16  but didn't like 5 out of 16. Dire Straits may have the best music  ever heard in my life. Now song by song review.    1.

0345350499|5.0|I may be a woman, but I know men who have read this and loved it. I read this book at fifteen, and it has been the best book I have ever read. I had seen Excalibur, and read Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, but I felt as if the paterfamilias Male and His Christian beliefs had minorized the women-- making them dumb, brainless; imbeciles by nature. Example: when King Uriens had been attacked my Morgan Le Fay (Malory), all she could say was \\"The Devil made me do it.\\" I felt as if they were almost being shoved out of the Arthurian legend, simply because the men were the ones to make the story. But Bradley made me realize that the women were INTEGRAL to the legend of The Boy King and his Knights; they made this story what it is. Each character is given a human face, and is portrayed brilliantly.

0385486804|5.0|This reads like a mystery novel, but where you know the ending right away. Well-off young man ditches all of his money and possessions, cuts of all family ties, and treks off into the wilderness, then winds up two years later dead.  <br /> <br />The fascinating aspect isn't just how but why? The writer does an excellent job painting not just the plot and turn of events but the characters, the people that Chris McCandless touched, and who he was, what he believed in. He also interweaves parts of his own story so that we can better understand the character's motivations and reasoning. <br /> <br />I could completely relate to McCandless on a number of levels. Anyone who's ever felt wanderlust, or bored of dissatisfied with the everyday and the life that society proscribes, or the desire to just get away...  most of us just put up with it. It's inspiring to read about someone who absolutely rebels and follows his ideals of what Life could be, and sad to see how it ends... Both a tribute and a caution.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|This is one of Dire Straits' best albums ever did. 5 songs look  very interesting into rock on this CD while the rest are as slow  as they could be. It even has my all time favorite song, Heavy Fuel. I own this, and the Sultans compilation album.     1. Calling Elvis: This is a long song but really good. 7/10    2. On Every Street: A nice slow song then gets rock and rolling after 3 in a half minutes. One of the best. 8/10    3. When It Comes to You: This is a calm song. Seems more like  country insted. But good rock. 6/10    5. The Bug: One of my favorites, this a fast rock song is really  creative and fun to listen to. 9/10    7. Heavy Fuel: This is the greatest song on this album ever. My  favorite song of all time on this album ever. Great rock and  roll, great work. 10/10    I enjoy listening to this album. Better than Brothers. Get this.
B00005JLT5|4.0|Based on the book by real-life pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, the film traces a single man, surviving on wits and luck through dark, cruel years of World War II Poland. Szpilman is a classical pianist whose middle-class, affluent Jewishness is not much of a liability until the Nazis arrive. From that point on, he and his family endure the slow tightening of the Nazi noose -- yellow armbands and petty restrictions -- leading up to the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto and the deportation of his family to the death camps.<br /><br />Like many Holocaust films, \\"The Pianist\\" fails to serve up the raw terror of the times. We are asked to view terrible scenes of mad cruelty, but as viewers, we are too detached to actually feel the unending sense of dread that must have been part and parcel of everyday life. It may be too much to ask a film to do this for us, but they must at least try.<br /><br />\\"The Pianist\\" is quite true to its namesake book. Both serve up hellish ad bizarre images that if they were not witnessed, would not be believed. The Polish partisan shot in the back and slumping to her knees in the street; the communion-like division of a tiny dime-candy among 6 doomed people; the Bizarre Waltz forced by bored Nazi guards on Jews waiting to cross a barred street; the young lad beaten to death trying to crawl through a storm drain; starving elderly Jewish workers fighting over a pot of beans. These are powerful images that convince because of their relative insignificance. The Holocaust and resistance were a compendium of such small yet telling moments of horror.<br /><br />While Adrian Brody well deserved the best-actor Oscar for this film, \\"The Pianist\\" is an extraordinary ensemble movie. Szpilman's family is very real -- by turns bickering, calming, worrying, sharing. Thomas Kretschmann, who plays German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, is extraordinary in his depiction of a man torn between duty and humanity. The Pianist brings to the screen the memories of a man who survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war -- the liquidation of the ghetto and the Warsaw uprising. It's a testament to the thousands and millions who played their small parts in a gigantic drama that shaped the last century.o survived two of the most extraordinary events of the war -- the liquidation of the ghetto and the Warsaw uprising.

B000069HKH|5.0|\\"The Rising\\" is, as noted, built around the attacks on September 11th, 2001, which are woven seamlessly through songs that express grief, anger, resolution, whimsy and even joy.  Bruce Springsteen has made a career out of writing and performing songs that speak for Everyman.  Here, his songs not only do the speaking, they do the mourning as well.<br /><br />The album opens up with the melancholy string introduction of \\"Lonesome Day,\\" which quickly kicks off with a driving beat and lyrics that get your attention.  \\"Better ask questions before you shoot/Deceit and betrayal's bitter fruit,\\" warns Springsteen, and it's hard not to not your head and agree, even as that song is followed by the gospel-infused \\"Into The Fire.\\"  From wanting revenge, the listener is dropped into heartfelt mourning.  The chorus \\"May your strength give us strength/May your faith give us faith,\\" could be directed to our neighbors around us as well as those who gave their lives to save others.<br /><br />The album gets into deeper ground with songs that speak to more general experience than just that one day, but still are starkly about the September 11th tragedy.  \\"Nothing Man\\" could address anyone who steps forward to help someone else, someone who can't quite believe that they didn't do something that no one else would have done.  \\"Counting On A Miracle\\" is heartbreaking--from another singer, we'd call it an elegant analogy; from Springsteen, it sounds like plain truth.  \\"Empty Sky\\" is quiet but seethes. \\"Worlds Apart\\" (with Ali Khan, whose vocals make this song) and \\"Further On Up The Road\\" could be bookends, one a passionate plea for understanding and union, the other a grim-eyed crusader's promise of a greater reward to come.  (\\"Further\\" is one of the best driving tunes ever.  Put it on while you're doing the speed limit and you'll find your foot getting heavier on the pedal while you pound out the beat on the steering wheel and belt this out for all to hear).<br /><br />\\"Let's Be Friends (Skin To Skin)\\" and \\"Mary's Place\\" are old-fashioned rockers in the Springsteen tradition, all straightforward charm and grace allied to an irresistable beat and melodies.  But then we get back into darker territory:  \\"The Fuse\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" conjure up images of loss, love and disaster, although these could also apply to any situation.  Springsteen doesn't hammer his point into your head; he sets up the scene and lets you draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />The best of the final three songs is the homonymous hit \\"The Rising,\\" which with its sing-along refrain and energetic tempo is the album's most uplifting and rousing cut.  (When it premiered on Los Angeles radio in 2002, I was carpooling--all of us joined in on the chorus and applauded at the end).  But while \\"Paradise\\" has an eerie, empathic atmosphere (and haunting lyrics that will have your skin coming up in goosebumps), the final song, \\"My City In Ruins,\\" just doesn't fit.  The tone is wrong when compared to the live version Springsteen performed for the fundraiser held on September 14, 2001.  That performance held more emotion and urgency than the cut on this album.  However, it doesn't detract from the album itself; once you've listened to all the tracks, you'll find yourself listening to them again.<br /><br />Like \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\\" \\"The Rising\\" is going to be known as one of Springsteen's masterpieces, and deservedly so.y's Place\\" are old-fashioned rockers in the Springsteen tradition, all straightforward charm and grace allied to an irresistable beat and melodies.

B00012QM8G|4.0|Steven Spielberg never met a human emotion he couldn't trivialize on film. Applied to the Holocaust, this inability to convey deep and complex feeling should have sunk this film. Luckily for us all, Spielberg was delivered from cinematic ignominy by a superb cast and story.<br /><br />Spielberg uses \\"Schindler's List\\" to tell the story of the saving of hundreds of Jews by one man, and the Shoah in general. While I commend him for taking on this difficult and important subject, he is the wrong man for the job. Spielberg often shows us scenes that should horrify us, but don't. Watching the Nazis line up a group of Jewish men, then shoot into them should convey the helplessness of the Jews and the sadism of the Nazis. Instead, by preventing his cast from interacting with the scene, he allows it is to play without emotion. Spielberg's fascination with shooting people in the head becomes more a study in the ways that human bodies react to being pierced by bullets than a study of the grotesqueries and randomness of genocide.<br /><br />Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler is what gives this movie the weight and heft that otherwise elude Spielberg. Neeson's Schindler is a rich, charming goy, willing to go with the political flow to make a few more dollars from whichever regime happens to be in power. Neeson does underplay Schindler's roguishness, I believe, which is a bit of a disappointment and an inaccuracy. He is already a *mensch* when the film starts and doesn't have far to go in his transformation in the face of Nazi horror. Yet his basic humanity, which eluded so many others during the war, allows him to save many.<br /><br />\\"Schindler's List\\" succeeds because of its story and on the performances of its cast. Liam Neeson, as noted, is superb. Ben Kingsley is masterful in his portrayal of bookkeeper Itzhak Stern. Ralph Fiennes delivers a cool and controlled portrait of German commandant Amon Goeth. This was a movie that had to be made. Though Spielberg was not the ideal man to direct it, better to have an imperfect depiction of the Holocaust than none at all.was not the ideal man to direct it, better to have an imperfect depiction of the Holocaust than none at all.

1567302017|5.0|First of all, I teach a semester course on the Holocaust in a Florida high school. I wrote the course and the curriculum for it. Teaching this course has become one of my passions, for it teaches concepts that move beyond history. Lessons like compassion, the true impact of hatred and tolerance and respect. The first time I read about Lanzmann's film was in the book \\"Explaining Hitler\\" by Ron Rosenbaum. I finally bought the VHS which was horribly expensive ($300), and later bought the DVD. The DVD was less expensive and a great deal easier to work with in the classroom format. As I began to study this document, I was prepared to disagree and not to like it at all. Rosenbaum's comments seemed to put me in that mindset. But as I worked with the film, over several years, I began to see what Lanzmann was doing and how he accomplished it. Today, it is a film that I use selected parts of in class, and I wouldn't be without it. Also, in my Master's program in Liberal studies at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, SHOAH is required viewing for their course on the Holocaust. <br /> <br />In the film, Lanzmann does some remarkable things. He first has you listening in several languages, while reading another (esp if you speak english). You get a whole education in European languages. Then, he does many interviews with both survivors and scholars. Some of these are long sections, but well worth the time, for the deep learning involved. Another thing I developed watching this film as a phobia about railroad tracks! To this day railroad tracks absolutely haunt me! Also, the interview with the barber has had a profound impact on 5 years of my Holocaust students. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this DVD for the person just beginning to study the Holocaust. I think one needs some knowledge, and some experience, especially emotional, with the material before attempting this. But once there, I recommend this film enthusiastically. Watch all the other films, and there are manyout there, but come back to this one! <br />
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This was Van Halen's fourth album with DLR that was put out back in 1981 and is possibly their best one ever. Eddie's guitar playing is amazing. He is defintly one of the best guitar players around. DLR's vocals are very good also to tell you the truth all of the Van Halen cd's with DLR are awesome so don't even bother with any of the sammy ahgar ones. So if you are looking for a Awesome Van Halen cd buy all of the one's with DLR.
B000002JSP|5.0|In Through The Out Door(1979). Led Zeppelin's Eighth And Final Album.<br /><br />In 1979, after releasing the well-received albums 'Precense' and 'The Song Remains The Same', Led Zeppelin took to the studios to record their last album, 'In Through The Out Door'. When the album came out, it was an immediate success, debuting at the top of the charts and spawning huge hits like \\"In The Evening\\", \\"Fool In The Rain\\", and \\"All My Love\\", and easily going multi-platinum over the years. Unfortunately, after the album's release, Led Zeppelin's long-time Drummer John Bonham suddenly died, and Led Zeppelin decided to disband. While Jimmy Page and Robert Plant each went on to successful solo careers, everyone agreed neither man could equal their early work. Oddly, when 'In Through The Out Door' debuted, it came wrapped in a paper bag, and had 6 alternate covers, each one showing the man at the bar from a different angle. So, is Led Zeppelin's final album mediocre or a amazing? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />In The Evening- Taking a cue from the emerging New Wave and Punk trends, Led Zeppelin crafted \\"In The Evening\\", a song that blends the genres flawlessly. Page's guitar lick seems to come straight out of \\"Rock And Roll\\", and his insane solo proves to be one of his center-pieces. Bassist John Paul Jones adds in synthesizers and keyboards to \\"In The Evening\\" to give it that Devo and Billy Idol feel, all the while  Page sings about love and relationships. Imagine Eric Clapton's 80's material, and it might give you an idea about this obvious classic.<br /><br />South Bound Saurez- Almost a take-off of Swing and Big Band music, \\"South Bound Saurez\\" sounds like rock n' roll's answer to bar singing. John Paul Jones puts in a frenzied keyboard beat(not unlike what you hear at bars), and Page gives the song it's bluesy and hard rock edge. Bonham and John Paul Jones do an excellent job of keeping the beat and pace of \\"South Bound Saurez\\", and this song proves to be surprisingly great!<br /><br />Fool In The Rain- Clearly, Bob Marley was at work on \\"Fool In The Rain\\", a heavily Reggae-influenced classic. Jimmy Page gives a breathtaking performance, ripping out those now-all-too-familar Reggae chords, not to mention incredible guitar arpeggios and solos. Robert Plant's vocals fit *perfectly*, and his love-lorn vocals seem to breathe compassion, while John Paul Jones' keyboarding remains solid throughout. Bonham does *magnificently* on the percussion, and \\"Fool In The Rain\\" is a song that's perfect for parties and wedding receptions; it's hard not to like!<br /><br />Hot Dog- I may profess to hating Country, but Country/Rock, like The Eagles, I can enjoy, and Zeppelin's \\"Hot Dog\\" finds them singing a smokin' Country and Bluegrass ditty. Page's addictive and toe-tappin' guitar and banjo melodies combine with Plant's sarcastic and joking vocals, and John Paul Jone's bassline is hard to forget. Basically, \\"Hot Dog\\" is a Country/Rock song that's just plain fun!<br /><br />Carouselambra- Zeppelin's last epic, \\"Carouselambra\\" sounds inspired by New Wave, with Jones' disco-y synth beat combining with Plant's blues power chords to create a song not unlike The Cars. Midway through, \\"Carouselambra\\" turns into a a spacy, dreamy song, and Page's epic and beautiful chords help the song along well. Yet again, \\"Carouselambra\\" turns into a song not unlike Madonna, except with Plant on vocals instead of her. Throughout, the song never falters, and \\"Carouselambra\\" is an epic masterpiece, even if it's not as cherished as \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\".<br /><br />All My Love- A timeless Led Zeppelin hit, \\"All My Love\\" is one of Zeppelin's most emotional and creative songs. Page combines a soulful rhythm guitar with Jones' moody synthesizer beat to create a tone of a lonely but hopeful person. Plant sings this melodic rocker perfectly, and \\"All My Love\\" is an emotional roller coaster that remains one of Zeppelin's best to this day.<br /><br />I'm Gonna Crawl- Oddly enough, \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" seems to contain influences of R&B and Soul, yet still remaining undeniably a Rock song. Plant's guitar lick is spacy and slightly Bluesy, and you get the feeling you're listening to a Pink Floyd song. Robert Plant sounds a like a sober James Brown(I do not kid!), and even so the song remains an odd, yet excellent song. How can it not be with these incredible musicians?<br /><br />Overall, 'In Through The Out Door' is Led Zeppelin's final album, yet that didn't stop them from making one of their best and most memorable albums of their illustrous career. Plant's bluesy guitar and Jones' New Wave synth beats collide on many of the songs to create a magnificent and totally original album that differs from almost every album before 'In Through The Out Door', and I even saw influences of Country and Reggae. Despite what many claim, it's not Led Zeppelin's weakest album, and it's not flawed: I like this one just as much as any of their first albums, which traditionally seem to be their most praised. Unfortunatly, after Bonham's death, we were left with the thought of what could have been, and what great music Led Zeppelin would have continued to make. While Page and Plant went to successful careers of their own, they will always live in the shadow of Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF ROCK AND LED ZEPPELIN! DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICISM, THIS IS ONE OF ZEPPELIN'S BEST! I URGE YOU TO PICK IT UP!<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Houses of the Holy- Led Zeppelin<br /><br />LA Woman- The Doors<br /><br />451 Ocean Boulevard- Eric Clapton<br /><br />Thanks For Reading!<br /> <br />I'm Gonna Crawl- Oddly enough, \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" seems to contain influences of R&B and Soul, yet still remaining undeniably a Rock song.

B000002L99|1.0|This was sammy hagar's first album with Van Halen after Diamond David Lee Roth was kicked out and let me tell you this CD is so bad I threw mine in the trash can as soon as I heard the first song. Eddie Van Halen's choice of throwing DLR out of Van Halen was the worst decision of his life.
B00000GUZP|5.0|KooKoo is the END ALL PROOF of how ahead of their time, and simply brilliant, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein are.  Three short years later the same collaborators, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of CHIC ('70's disco), produced Like A Virgin for Madonna.  It is interesting to wonder if she ever would have acchieved the stratisphere she occupies today without THEM (Rodgers & Edwards) on THAT release. <br />At the height of Blondie's international domination Debbie Harry meant to create something different.  Unfortunately it came with built-in expectations - and under ridiculous scrutiny.  My own included.  At 15 years old I wasn't ready to give up my favorite ROCK star to the R&B world. - even after AutoAmerican.  I remain doubtlessly convinced if KooKoo was the beginning of Debbie Harry's career it would have occupied more shelf space than the Material Girl ever has.  KooKoo's relative failure in 1981 is the public's loss and NOT Debbie Harry's.   <br />After 23 years of adulation it is impossible for me to list stand out tracks.  Each one is so perfectly executed.  But I can PROMISE if you give this selection a few listens it will reward you with a rich and indescribably satisfying experience.  I would ALMOST guarantee your $$ back from my own pocket.  ENJOY!
B0001Z52RU|2.0|Why do people in Hollywood try to take a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone and stretch it out to almost 2 hours??  <br /> <br />This movie is way too long.

B0006213WG|3.0|I listened to this CD on MTV's The Leak, and it was okay, i guess. Sum 41 is not really that pop-punk, i don't think they have been since \\"Does This Look Infected\\". To me \\"All Killer No Filler\\" was their pop-punk CD and \\"Chuck\\" is their more metal sounding CD, with \\"Does This Look Infected\\" bridging the gap. I liked Does This Look infected better, it was a nice mix, pop-punk with some metal, the kind of stuff I wished Sum 41 did longer. This isn't a bad CD, and well I haven't really listened to it multiple times, only two, really. I like the songs \\"Some Say\\" and \\"There's No Solution\\" the best from this CD, but hey, I might change my mind after a couple more listens. I had expected and hoped somewhat of a \\"Does This look Infected Part 2\\" but the boys  progressed and this is what they're doing now I guess. If you like metal-sounding stuff get this, if you're an \\"all killer, no filler\\" fan then maybe you should check out another CD, and if you're a \\"Does This Look Infected\\" fan then listen before you buy.
B000286S8S|5.0|This is the album that Van Halen didn't have the guts to give us when they made that piece of crap Best of Volume 1. I do got to say they did have some pretty good new tracks, but so does this one so if you have to pick between the two, take this one. Sure the first best of may have come with three bonus tracks, one Sammy Hagar and two David Lee Roths, but this one comes with three awesome new Hagar tracks. I am a little disappointed that they didn't release the new tracks from the first best of album because they were really good, but there are definitely improvements: <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />1.Balanced representation: This album is as balanced as possible unlike the first best of album which was heavily Lee Roth stuff. This one gives both eras equal representation even though there are a few more Hagar tracks than Lee Roth tracks, but what you expect, there's 39 songs on this! <br />2.Cool Cover <br />3.Great new songs <br />4.Great live tracks <br /> <br />Cons: <br />1.There is absolutely no thanks to David Lee Roth anywhere in the album booklet. All it says is:\\"exit Roth enter Hagar. What happened? Anyway Van Halen...\\" and when they have their thank you section no one thanks Diamond Dave at all!! Come on, even people in Hagar's solo band get thanked and David Lee Roth gets nothing!? <br />2.Too booklet emphasis on Hagar. <br /> <br />Overall a great deal, just don't be angry when you read the booklet, cause I warned you.
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|<br />i still have some of my original tapes from the '85 broadcast and believe that poor performances may have been blocked from re-release by the artist.  A few of the performers at Wembley had trouble playing on Freddie Mercury's Steinway -- Phil Collins had one or two embarassing screw-ups on \\"Against All Odds,\\" which was left off this DVD.  And Simon LeBon's vocals were at one point reduced to a tortured squeal on \\"A View To a Kill.\\"  I also read that they doctored Paul McCartney's performance of \\"Let it Be\\"?  At the original concert, his mic was completely off during the first verse.  Due to the complexity of the production, most bands went onstage with little or no time for sound checks!  I would've preferred to see the mistakes left in the DVD.   <br /> <br />

B00006BNDI|4.0|Burzum has definitely made some name for himself back in the day. Some people may be turned off by Varg, b/c though he does have some genuine intentions, it's the violently extreme means he goes about solving what he sees as problems which cause lots of metal fans to not take that Burzum step. Being my first album from him I was pretty much ready for what it was going to throw at me, and I'll definitely say I'm very pleased with it.   Varg takes us into his mind through this extreme atmospheric form of black metal, by means of archaic sadness and blackened pleasure w/ this 4 song 45 minute journey. The music isn't the verse/chorus structure we're all used to, nor is it the progressive non-verse/chorus structure we're all used to. The music flows through by its own accord, uncaring about ending or giving way to expectancy or mercy until it wants to.   the album kicks off great w/ \\"Dot Som En Gang Var,\\" which opens w/ a static-like dirty guitar in a slow rhythm, along w/ a smooth, dramatic and desolate keyboard melody giving way and repeats for about a minute over the guitar. the simple and angry chord progression kicks in and what flows next is a 14 minute track of pleasure and pain. Varg painfully passionate screams don't follow a real structure but seem to kick in when he feels it is appropriate. The repetiveness of the keyboard melody hypnotizes you slowly into Varg's dark universe, and if you're open enough to go in w/o calling Varg on being non-creative (which he is, creative i mean) by repeating the same line over and over, you'll reap great benefits. Later on the song gives way to a different keyboard melody but guitars stay similar. There is a lot of repeating lines somewhat like in the vain of Ministry, but not anywhere near its mainstream sound.  The second track starts quick w/ a pummeling drum beat and simple 2 chord guitar line. the tempo is faster and more violent than the first. this simple drum/guitar progression repeats for pretty much the entire song (about 9 or so minutes, i think)but soon the percussion changes beats and a second guitar is heard, underneath the first, w/ rasping melodies like a rusted razor, as well as keyboard hums beneath. The drum beats once again hypnotizes as do Varg's screams. the music layering on this song reminded me of Nine Inch Nails' same layering formulas, but much,MUCH more raw and violent. Probably the song I like least on the album.. but still like it, a lot.   \\"Im I Slottet Fra Droemmen\\" follows and is similar to track 2, but w/ a slower pummelling guitar line. Later in the track an amazing and once again razor sharp guitar melody, or shall I say aura, takes lead and drags your ears into their own violent intentions - pictures of dark and medieval grand evil castles and dark Lords come to mind. Those progressions just suck you in like nothing else. Awesome song.   The ender \\"Tomhet\\" is somewhere w/in the 12-15 minute length (i honestly don't know, the song is too hypnotizing and beautiful for me to even care) and is basically all arranged w/ keyboards. the opening melody is simple and sounds like 2 keyboards playing together, the first is laying the sad atmospheric foundation while the other is expressing a certain \\"happiness\\" or \\"peace.\\" This repeats over for about 5 or 6 minutes. The mood changes as keyboards become somewhat more \\"cutsy\\" (dont knoww if that's the right word) sounding. this is a song so peaceful it could easily put you to sleep.   This album seems to take the listener into some kind of journey through sadness, despair, pain, death and eventual peace. The music is unlike anything you're ever going to hear. It is simple yet complex, painful yet pleasureable, chaotic yet peaceful, forceful yet saddened. This isn't the type of drive-in-your-car-to album, but more one you need to experience alone w/ a clear, OPEN mind. most people will throw this aways as being unbearable noise (as some of it is a lot of \\"noise\\") but only the most accepting will be rewarded it'spleasures. if there is one thing that bothered me the most about the record, it had to be its length, I only wish the songs were longer in some cases (tracks 1 and 3). Track 2 being a great song, could only gain from some much needed diversity, so it's not perfect, thus the 4.5 star review. Still though, this is a fantastic atmospheric album that any fan of dark music could appreciate.

It was only through the stories of Jules Verne and George Melie's \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" that we were able to venture to that celestial body that is the Moon. But between 1968 and 1972, nine missions from NASA's Apollo Space Program traveled the 200,000+ mile distance to the moon, bringing alive the dreams of Verne, Melie, Robert Goddard, and many others.<br /><br />Tom Hanks' \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is a riveting and exceptional miniseries that covers, for the most part, the missions that took us on that thrilling adventure to another celestial body. The program takes you back to that time when mankind's dream became a reality. It features superb performances (too many great actors to name) and excellent production values in all areas involved.<br /><br />While the whole miniseries is a classic, the standout episode is '1968,' which deals with Apollo 8. After eleven months of hell (The Tet Offensive in Vietnam, the Riot at the Democratic National Convention, the assassinatons of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, and so much more), the world stopped to watch the first three men make the historic first orbits of the moon. This episode makes it clear: Apollo 8 saved 1968 from being a terrible year overall.<br /><br />\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" is an exceptional miniseries. Those who view it will not be disappointed. It truly was \\"the most hazardous, dangerous, and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.\\" Grade: A+
0679735259|5.0|When I first read \\"Dispatches\\" I was amazed at how it really just yanked me along and having gotten a new copy along with \\"Rumor of War\\" and \\"The Bamboo Chest: An Adventure in Healing the Trauma of War\\" it would be one of my all time three bests book on Vietnam, Caputos and Herr's recapturing the main part of the war, and Graham catching the worsts part of the war and what Vietnam was like because we lost there, learned while held in Vietnam as the first American political prisoner held by the Socialist Republic of Vietnam since the end of the war. Two old books and one that just came out this June. Get them all and you'l have a respectable collection on Vietnam that will answer every question! <br /> <br />What I was most ironic is that Graham was drawn back to Southeast Asia as a teenager to become a combat photojournalist like his idols, Sean Flynn and Tim Page, two wild men photogs that that hung around with Michael Herr. What a time described by Herr, it's no wonder Graham was drawn back there after the war.
B00004R99J|1.0|We all sat down one Sunday evening with our two children - a little over 2 and almost 4 - to watch Pocahontas.  We were all enjoying it very much - beautiful Pocahontas, the funny racoon and hummingbird and the majestic scenery...  Then the violence started.  The Indian was shot DEAD, the people were angry, the Indians were called \\"savages\\" then John Smith was seriously injured.  I thought this movie was pointless and violent.  I do not recommend it to any one much less any one under 8.
B0000025DT|5.0|I won't repeat what others have said already, except to add that this album means as much to me at 41 as it did when I was 16 - possibly even more. Not only is it ELO's finest album, it is one of the most pleasurable recordings ever made in any genre - and I say that as someone whose listening tastes are dominated by classical music and jazz. One suggestion: could Sony do a new digital remastering of this (and \\"Out of the Blue\\")? The current release, albeit at a budget price, feels a little spartan, and this album merits so much more!
B00005JMXX|1.0|In other news, I've been watching The Day After Tomorrow - the disaster picture in which the world gets turned on to a whole new ice age.  This movie is pure liberal propaganda.  Disgust you to see it.  In the beginning of the movie there is much drama about the US not signing onto the Kyoto agreement, and how this is basically the cause of the havoc that the movie is all about.  Then we are treated to the main human interest characters:  a scientist couple who are divorced (natch) and have a somewhat hostile relationship but who are bonded by their common interest in the welfare of their only child - an unmasculine teenage boy who is afraid of flying in airplanes and who grips the hand of a teenage girl companion for comfort during a bumpy flight.  Real he-man stuff.  It seems to me typically liberal that the scientist couple only had the one child.  Why strain yourself, am I right? And the girl he's got the hots for seems strangely moribund, like she doesn't get enough fresh air or something.  In the scene on the plane, the boy is trying to combat his fear of flying by gobbling candy.  Typical liberal behavior.  Moving right along, once the ice-age storm really gets going, and threatens to engulf North America, there is footage of Americans in droves trying to cross the border into Mexico.  Much reporting on the irony of this \\"flood of illegal immigration INTO Mexico\\"  The Mexican government is sealing the border until the US President cuts a deal whereby the Mexican border is opened to desperate gringos (\\"Ju e-like me ahora, eh gringo?!?\\") in exchange for - get this - the US forgiving latin American debt.  I'm not making this up.  Yet another example of how meddlesome liberals are.  You can't even see a freaking movie without it turning into a liberal indoctrination center on you.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Anime has grown into a popular genre for many people, both young and old, across the world. In some western universities, a striving undergraduate can now take it as a major, even taking the subject further as a research project in the attainment of a Masters degree. One of the more popular anime film features is `Spirited Away'. In fact, in my opinion, it is a good introduction to the genre, as it is a work of pure art, made with compassion and detail, a beautiful film in every respect.<br /><br />At first glance, the story echoes other well known stories, such as `Alice Through the Looking Glass' and `The Wizard of Oz.' Although similar on the surface, in terms of a little girl finding herself in a fantastic land, searching for a way out, `Spirited Away' has it own unique signature. The cast of strange characters are legion, the strangest being `No Face', a black hooded, masked demon-like phantom who, in more ways than one, is the central character, who reveals that greed is within all of us, contrasting the lead, Chihiro, the brave and compassionate little girl, who must pass a series of tests in order to free her parents from the clutches of a terrible spell, brought on, by the way, through their own greed.<br /><br />The story begins with Chihiro and her parents driving through the countryside. They stumble upon a peculiar structure and walk through a tunnel into what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro, of course, is reluctant to enter the place, but her parent's curiosity wins out. In the park they come across shelves upon shelves of delicious food. Mother and father cannot help themselves and begin gorging the food until they're transformed into massive pigs. This is our first clue as to one of the film's central themes: greed. Thus begins Chihiro's journey into a fantastic land of creatures, spirits and evil witches.<br /><br />What I found astounding about this film was the care and attention to detail in every scene. All too often we take for granted just how much work in involved in creating an animated film. There are indeed some astonishing scenes in this film that would of taken days, weeks or even months to create. When viewing this film with this in mind, my appreciation for anime and animation in general, moved straight to the top. Anime is certainly a burgeoning art form in many ways.<br /><br />`Spirited Away' is a film for all ages; a wonderful example of anime and perhaps a good introduction to the study of the genre itself - absolutely five stars.take for granted just how much work in involved in creating an animated film.

B0002CTSW2|1.0|Like its source book, this movie is kitsch and schmaltz, the coarse and the crass - cloaked in imitation profundity.<br />The Jesus figure is a man-made symbol of fatherly-brotherly altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. This myth is utilised to feed a mental loop of unfulfilled yearnings, guilt and shame.  So the movie is built on self-referring, primitive, goat-herder stories, wilfully mistaken for something meaningful.<br />The movie's source book of primitive stories depicts fantasy figures called `Jesus' and `God' - invented by humans many centuries ago. It is purely and solely the drives of human culture and the products of neurological phenomena and obsessive thought-loops that produced the Bible. `God' is the product of neurological quirk, fused with ego-driven cultural obsession.<br />To believe the movie's source book as the word of `God' is merely to fail to recognise its solely human sources: emotional, neurological, cognitive, cultural, sociological. Man's habitual self-deception and delusional, repetitive thought patterns generate religious belief. If a baby's fixation on the all-powerful, all-providing, all-knowing parent figure becomes mentally fixed - the result is rigid, fixated Christ and God-belief in adulthood.<br />So given both its ancient and contemporary creative sources, it is no surprise then that this is a gaudy movie - a blunt instrument - lacking finesse and subtly. It is makes crude appeal to crude emotions and is vulgar in its execution.<br />The Bible is bogus, spurious, and a garish concoction: a crude, blunt, vulgar appeal to amorphous concepts and broad-brush emotions and desires. For example: fear of death, the feeling of being lost and needing rescue, the psyche's desire for immortality, hunger for an upwardly directed relationship.<br />Longings that merely end up as self-comfort mind-loops.<br />If only this movie had been ignored - but it is just too difficult for people to break out of the neurological quirk that is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is. The movie is merely a contemporary manifestation of a relentless tradition of self-deception and delusion - of Bible-swill and God mush - and the desire to spread the mind washing cult-virus that is Christianity.<br />Someone called `Jesus' might or might not have existed but - manifestly - he was not the `Son of God'. As such, this movie's core claim of `the Christ' is bogus and spurious.<br />Humans wish to make sense of suffering. For some, `the Christ' on the Cross is a culturally potent man-made symbol of altruistic sacrifice and of suffering. Constructs of sin, fallen man etc all illustrate that Christianity is merely a fabricated construct employed by humankind/people to:<br />- understand their own suffering<br />- come to terms with their own suffering<br />- justify suffering by the person(s) experiencing it<br />- justify suffering by the person(s) inflicting it<br />If all of humankind were extinguished, so would 'Jesus' and 'God' - since this is their sole locus of existence. Truly it is manifest to all that: on the 7th day, man created God in his own image.<br />Chances are that people who dislike this review will promptly generate ever more fierce and tight circles of belief thought-loops in order to dismiss it.<br />At the foot of the end credits, we are accurately and truthfully informed that:<br />&quot;Characters and events portrayed in this motion picture are fictitious.&quot;is religious belief, embedded and fused into culture as it most surely is.

B000002J09|3.0|Led Zeppelin are the be all and end all of rock. They singlehandley started hard rock, and rock died when they split. Bands like Black Sabbath, Van Halen, Nirvana and AC/ DC are just pale imitations of the mighty Zeppelin. No band has ever come close to the sheer talent they had. I don't know who they were, but they must have been either aliens or Gods to give us music that great. <br /> <br />That's the accepted wisdom. Except that I personally think it's a crock.  Part of Zeppelins enduring popularity is due to peer pressure, especially among high schoolers. Among the rock culture not liking Zeppelin is practically heresy. The Emperors servants in The Emperors New Clothes fable spring to mind. They couldn't see the Emperors clothes either but didn't want to say so for fear of seeming stupid. So they tag along gamely. In earlier centuries heretics were burnt at the stake. These days thankfully measures are not so severe but not liking the Mighty Zeppelin is still a serious matter to rock fans. Insults are hurled at the offenders  and the culprits street cred plummets. If you don't like Zeppelin you must be a filthy Avril/ Korn/ Metallica/ Stones/ Sabbath /N Sync loving b*****d! Soon nobody invites them to parties anymore. Misery. Oh well they'll just have to buy \\"Early Days\\" and \\"How The West Was Won\\" and show them to their friends. Replies of \\"Dude, you've finally got taste!\\" are uttered and the storm blows over. Phew! You've joined the One True Faith! <br /> <br />I don't think that any single one band started heavy metal. Whats the definiton of heavy metal?  Probably most would say amped up guitars, high pitched impassioned vocals and a headbanging riff. But can't you bang your head to Purple Haze, Spanish Castle Magic or even My Generation? Amped up guitars? Hendrix, Cream, Jeff Beck. High pitched vocals? Well I'd say that Paul Mccartney on Helter Skelter did a good job there. And Rod Stewart singing for The Jeff Beck Group could get a mention. The thing with Zeppelin is that they didn't start anything at all, they were more of a melting pot of influences. You could say that their first two albums defined their sound, which is mainly fiery blues rock I suppose. But what's so revolutionary about blues rock? They just made it more intense. For their era. People often say that no band has ever touched Zeppelin, which is adorably ethusiastic and naive, but how -and I stress this point- can you  make that judgement if you haven't heard all of what's been happening in the 35 years since Led Zeppelins debut? Just because stuff like Limp Bizkit is, erm, \\"unimpressive\\" it doesn't mean that everything these days is bad. And hidden gems await the bold from more obscure albums from the 70s, 80s and 90s.  Nobody's going to make the effort of listening to the thousands of other hard rock albums that have been released since 1969 however so I'm afraid it's going to be more of the \\"LED ZEPPELIN ARE UNTOUCHABLE\\" mantra. It's a nice crutch for the lazy and subservient.  Led Zep could play thier instruments well and churn out a decent song but so what? How many other bands could that apply to? Led Zep are a middle of the pack band to me. I've heard maybe 500 or so rock/ metal albums from 1970 onwards and to me Led Zep stand out in no department as the best of its kind. <br /> <br />They have their place in rock history but the pedastal they're on is so high that they'll need some oxygen breathing masks. And unfortuantely as they years roll on the Led Zeppelin mythology is going to get bigger...and bigger.....bigger. Maybe in the year 73424 when our desendants have colonised the furthest reaches of our Galaxy an expedition will return to the dust choked legendary planet \\"Earth\\" and find evidences of popular culture and say \\"Dear Bonham in heaven , so this is where Zeppelin was created!\\" <br /> <br />Oh and by the way I think that Misty Mountian Hop and The Crunge are the two worst songs I've heard in my life.  And I mean laugh out loud bad.The fact that they're even taken seriously by some is a good indication of how overrated Zeppelin really is!  Stairway To Heaven isn't bad per se, just boring, even the first few times. Although I like Plants Bee Gees impersonation on the finale.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY.  THIS MOVIE WAS VERY UPLIFTING AND APPROPRIATE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS.  THE ACTORS WERE PERFECT AND SO WAS THE STORY.
B00003CXCT|2.0|I used to be a fan of George Lucas - that is until he started messing around with computer graphics and forgot just what it was that made his films so charming - the people.<br /><br />After seeing the Phantom Menace, I just had to accept that we have lost a major film maker. Then when he started messing with the original series from 1977 - I just couldn't believe it. Yes a director should have the final say on their work, but.....I have lost interest.  What made Star Wars special to me was the humanity of it - it had an almost mythological significance to our culture - it wasn't something we went to see simply for the special effects - it was deeper than that. Unfortunately, George Lucas has lost sight of what made his films special - and he is trying to 'improve them'. Sorry George it just does not blend together and it is like seeing a fake copy of an original painting - please restore it the way it was before- it was so much better!
B00005JMXX|3.0|Not nearly as bad as most reviewers said, but still pretty bad. Looks great and some amazing effects, but very slim in the sustance department. The story is non-existent. Watch it with a friend and have fun with the horrible dialogue and the stunning looks - of the effects and the cast.
B00005JMXX|2.0|For being called a disaster film i expected more disaster.  All that happens is theres a few tornadoes, some water, it gets cold, then everything goes back to normal, o yeah and some people freeze in the process.  Wow i havent seen that before (the core, deep impact, its been done).  Sure its about global warming, but then why is it so damn cold... im not saying it wouldnt be cold, but if it is so cold then why do the wolves last so long out in the blizzard, and the people and buildings feeeze in a second, are the invincible wolves, NO.  The rest of the movie makes sense they did a pretty good job with science and explained what they needed to.  The visuals are good but not oscar worthy, i mean come on what was with those wolves, the hyenas from exorcist the beginning looked realer (and that was a much better overall film too, much better), and all those shots of NY covered in snow and ice looked hand drawn almost, the tidal wave looked the best out of them all, the tornadoes were alright but you only see them for 2 mins.  Overall the film is decent, decent performances (not good) decent, no intense situation of peril (all the disaster stuff takes up like 10 mins of the movie all together, not impressive), the visuals are pretty good, there is too dramatic of a score for the movie because there is no drama, we need more background info on the characters, ID4 and Godzilla are better, Rolands best film is the patriot, its pretty good.  Ill give it a 5 out of a 10 for the attempt at some good mayhem, but it falls alittle short.
B00006LWSF|4.0|Eminem has some unique poetic tricks in his writing that are even more surprising than the words and topics he employs. But this mix includes artists who are good but much more comforting (such Macy Gray, still underrated as a vocalist) and others are much less comforting and much less talented (such as 50 cent, vastly overrated as artist of any kind).<br /><br />In toto, this \\"soundtrack\\" (itself a misnomer, since it includes many trakcs simply \\"inspired by\\" the movie, rather than from it) includes a fabulous first track, and then fifteen tracks that mire in mediocrcity. They're fine as background for cubicle work, but don't mark any unique or interesting turn in cultural history.<br /><br />Yeah, we've had enough of Shady. But are cameo collections all that will follow?
0553583182|5.0|This book has changed my life by attuning me to how life really works.  I am convinced of the truths presented in this book, and I believe anyone can do anything if they apply the methods in this book.  It explains what the Bible is really trying to say; the truths in the Bible are the same as the truths in all the great spiritual books thoughtout time.  A must read for any human being.
B0000640VN|4.0|Kate and Leopold is the story of a handsome and noble British duke from the 1800's (Hugh Jackman)who accidentally comes to present-day Manhattan due to a scientist's discovery of time travel.  Leopold meets the scientist's jaded corporate ex-girlfriend Kate (Meg Ryan), and the two fall in love.  The problem is that no one, including Kate, believes Leopold is a genuine article.  Will Leopold ever get back to his time?  What of their relationship?<br /><br />The movie drags in the middle, but is still a wonderful undertaking.  The film would not have been as good without Liev Schreiber as the brilliant but odd scientist, and Breckin Meyer as Kate's warm-hearted wanna-be actor brother.  Schreiber has some of the best lines in the film.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman carries the movie single-handedly.  His portrayal of the chivalrous duke will make women sigh and men whip up breakfasts in bed.  Hugh is so dreamy, drop-dead handsome.  The Duke contrasts well with Kate's tough single career woman image.  A message in this film is that modern times are sorely lacking some things from the old days, like slowing down the hectic pace of life, really tasting and enjoying your food, and finding truth and meaning in today's confusing, ad-ridden society.
B0000048CP|5.0|...A classic album, from bathory with no weak tracks and blackmetal at its purest form,i might add. I mean, its realy fast,heavy,insane,haunting, and, most of all ? Original with the best satanic lirycs to ever be writting.  Bathory's \\"blood fire death\\" is twenty years old and it still reigns high as the best blackmetal album ever created. Recommended!
B00005JMXX|3.0|Why do talented movie people spend so much time and effort on a feature in which we know the actors' every move before they even make them?<br /><br />Daddy leaves behind his post and everyone who counts on his expertise, to come to the rescue of his son. The son gets the girl, and everybody that's somebody survives.<br /><br />Yawn.<br /><br />And how many movies display the Statue of Liberty broken down, frozen up, flooded, or damaged in some way? Another yawn.<br /><br />One entertaining facet of the plot, thought, is the prediction model the main character, Dennis Quaid, uses to predict the catastrophe. As well, the special effects are high quality and the acting is solid.<br /><br />Like I said, effort, talent, and quality went into that movie. It is really unfortunate that the plot is predictable as to diminish the experience.
B00005JMXX|4.0|i got my dvd today, and boy was i pleasantly delighted!  a great disaster flick that is wildly entertaining and thought provoking, especially with the current boonies in the white house, who could care less about global warming! the disc is superb looking, as is the dts sound! get it you will be entertained-not disappointed!  it's a winner.........
B0000C8AVM|5.0|There's something about this album that sends chills down my spine. Bob Dylan is a great poet and his lyrics are amazing. I find that I can't let this album serve as background music. When I listen, I listen to each and every lyric so intently. Like my favourite musician Joni Mitchell, there's just something special about Dylan's songs. They grab at you, make you think about the lyrics once you're finished. Dylan's songs are fun to listen to at the same time. The best on the album are 'Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts', 'Shelter From the Storm', and 'Tangled Up in Blue'. Man, what a great album.
B00006AW2P|5.0|This was the Rolling Stones first album, and it was an excellent debut.  Having not yet developed as songwriters, nine of the twelve songs here are covers of American rock, R&B, and blues songs.  The album gets off to a great start, with a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\", which was the Stones first UK Top 10 hit.  Then the band goes through several other great covers, which they probably had played many times at their live appearances.  As for the original material... \\"Now I've Got a Witness\\" is an enjoyable instrumental jam, with the title obviously being a play on \\"Can I Get a Witness\\", the Marvin Gaye song that they cover here.  \\"Little By Little\\" is a fun bluesy number, which Phil Spector shared credit for writing with \\"Nanker Phelge\\".  The real gem of the original songs is \\"Tell Me\\", which is a tender ballad that probably caught a lot of people by surprise at the time.  \\"Tell Me\\" went on to become the Stones first US Top 30 hit (it was not released as a single in the UK).  A great debut by one of the greatest bands of all times, and highly recommended.  Oh, I should mention that despite this CD being labeled as \\"stereo\\", it is actually in mono.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|One of the best musical groups in history now has a 'greatest hits' album that does them justice. Every song from 'Rumours' is on here except for 'I Don't Want to Know' and 'Oh Daddy'. It spans Fleetwood's entire career (well, when it started with Stevie Nicks and Chrissy McVie that is) and has all of their great songs on two discs. We get classics like, 'Go Your Own Way', 'Dreams', 'The Chain', 'Gypsy', 'Little Lies', 'Landslide', etc... but this really was an introduction for me because I only knew all of their popular songs. I was so happy to discover that almost every song (excpet for 'Hold Me', 'Family Man' and 'Sisters of the Moon') is amazing. Stevie Nicks has the sexiest voice in the business and it's stamped all over this album. Chrissy McVie writes some great pop-friendly songs and Lindsey Buckingham's work on guitar is nothing short of amazing. Now this... is music.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore obviously can't stand George W. Bush, and goes out of his way to make him look bad in this film, but making him look bad doesn't seem to take much of an effort. <br /> <br />The most amazing part of the movie was the film of the president sitting in a classroom, listening to kids read a story, when one of his aides told him the country was under attack.  He sat there for seven minutes, frozen, before getting up to do something about the attacks. <br /> <br />We always hear about the \\"liberal media\\" in this country, but if the media is so liberal why didn't we ever see his failure to react to the news until this movie came out?  Obviously, there was no time to show this at the time, but why didn't the networks go back and show us this lack of reaction a month or two later? <br /> <br />Anyway, if you haven't decided how you will vote you should watch this movie and it might help you decide.  A few of the points Moore makes in the film include: <br /> <br />1.  There was no reason to go to war with Iraq.   <br />2.  Only one member of Congress has a child serving in Iraq.   <br />3.  Most of the soldiers are from poor areas like Flint, Michigan <br />    where there are no other jobs. <br />4.  The Homeland Security Act makes very little sense.   <br />5.  The greed of companies like Haliburton is disturbing.  They  <br />    are the big winners in this war. <br /> <br />Of course if you back Bush, you'll say the film is totally biased and a waste of time, so you probably won't want to bother with it.  On the other hand, if you're a Bush backer with an open mind you might learn a thing or two from this film.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is it. 'Blue' captures so much feeling and love, loss and heartbreak. And no one writes this material like Joni. This album contains her most beautiful songs, 'The Last Time I Saw Richard', 'River' and her most catchy, 'Carey', 'California', <br />'All I Want'. Every track is stellar. Bob Dylan gets most of the credit for being the greatest lyricist/poet we have, but Joni proves with this album, that Dylan can't even touch this stuff. It's a great album to listen to when you're driving at night. Recently, I took a long trip and this album was perfect to listen to with the windows down, 'wind is in from Africa...' -Well not quite, but you get the idea. If you don't have this in your collection, by all means, buy it.
630503723X|4.0|The best of the original trilogy, I think. Those are the ones where Sylvia Kristel starred (i.e., had more than a moment on screen), and vastly better than the tripe that followed in the Emmanuelle name.<br /><br />This is a warmly sensuous film. This might even be the one to use for introducing a shy viewer to movies about physical happiness. Emmanuelle is fully her own woman - every scene lies well within her consent and enjoyment. A new character, Anna Maria, is a sweet, innocent young thing. Emmanuelle, of course, broaches that innocence in an elegantly filmed sequence of encounters. A few scenes, like the infamous \\"Jade Club\\", come across as crude, but only when meant to. Still, they don't seem threatening. That's another aspect of this film that I like better than the first.<br /><br />It's too much to say that this movie has a plot, but it does have a story line of sorts. The movie is really just about happy eroticism, though, the kind that relies more on your imagination than on actual imagery. It's sort of like a musical where I come out humming the tunes even if I can't remember the words. Couples might like this movie, even bashful couples, and might like playing along with the actors on screen.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002GWN|4.0|I've always loved 'live' albums and this one really impressed  me. I liked how 'Big Yellow Taxi', 'Woodstock' and 'Carey' were really sped up and more upbeat. I think that's important for a live audience. When you go to a concert, you want to jam, and there's a lot of that on this album. The song collection is great, including great live versions of 'People's Parties' and 'Woman of Heart and Mind'. 'Love and Money', the new track is just okay but it's always nice to hear something different. In between songs, Joni offers a little interaction with the audience and proves quite humorous. It's a fun album to listen to but also brilliantly captures the beauty of her songs.
0393035158|5.0|I would rate this a MUST READ for anyone with the curiosity and courage to examine EVERYTHING. The relevence of this book in a time of global war with Islamic terrorists makes one's heart race as you read it. <br />It is IMO a courageous piece of work that gives \\"political IN-correctness\\" a new benchmark. Harris's arguments are as entertaining as they are thought provoking and page after page . . . compelling. Unlike all the philosophers I studied as an undergraduate, Harris constructed solid arguments that effectively fused the strict requirements of science with the very different empirical study of the consciousness, in a defensible model. Something I know from experience is possible.  <br />I respect his bold use of examples current to the point of being incomplete events when he wrote - so I can forgive a few that are playing out differently than how he illustrated them in example (Afghan elections look pretty good by Islamic stds eh?) The whole book is worth the read just to get to the rhinoceros analogy.
B000002KGT|5.0|This was the best of Fleetwood Mac's efforts and wow, what a great collection of songs! 'I Don't Want to Know' is one of the most catchy songs ever written. It's impossible to get it out of your head. We get some of their most popular songs ever like 'Go Your Own Way', The Chain', 'Don't Stop', and 'Dreams'. There's a great contrast between the songs/lyrics of Stevie and Chrissy. Whereas Chrissy writes all the radio-friendly, pop tunes, Stevie's lyrics seem deeper and mysterious. Everything about this album is great and I recommend it to everyone who wants to hear some great rock music.
B00001QEE6|5.0|I love Lady and The Tramp! It is definetly my favorite Disney movie of all times! I love Lady. I always watch the movie with my cocker spaniel dog Sophie laying next to me. Its funny too because everytime the part with the dogs howling in the kennel, Sophie starts howling with them ha ha. I give this movie 5 stars! I'd give it more, but 5 was as high as it would go.
B000002KOQ|5.0|This was the first Joni Mitchell album I ever bought. It contains her most popular song, 'Big Yellow Taxi' but there's so much more to appreciate here. Songs like 'Rainy Night House' and 'The Arrangement' are so lovely that you stop what you're doing just to listen to the lyrics. This is a great album to listen to when you first wake up in the morning. I mean, what better way to start the day off than with 'Morning Morgantown'? I can't say better things about this album. It's very calming at times and cynical at others. 'The Priest' and 'Rainy Night House' are haunting. This album solidified Joni as one of the greatest artists of all.
B00005JNEI|4.0|No body in Hollywood is smarter than anyone individual.... Well, I guess Ronald and Arnold don't count.  May be they are exceptions because they're republicans. I don't care what Republicans or Democrats say.  Buy this movie then read a book, a newspaper, watch TV, etc.  Or, you can read a book, a newspaper, watch TV and then buy this movie.  I think individuals are smart enough to figure things out for themselves and this movie helps to shed light in areas never explored.  Regardless of how this movie is slanted there are many undisclosed and disturbing FACTS about the events of 9/11 and the war in Iraq presented here. This movie doesn't dog America! Don't twist the facts! It dogs the decision to take America into war for reasons other than those that threaten(ed) the country.  I don't support Michael Moore or either party but I do support informed voters. Read and watch what you like but you should recognize that there are messages in between the lines of every piece of political material out there! We have the freedom check out the facts/opinions presented in this film ourselves. Many people don't know what their looking for when they research the background of the candidates. I think that Michael Moore did a good job gathering info on Bush. He could have done more but he chose not to. The facts presented in this movie should serve as a base for investigative/informative voters.  Watch the movie and take it with a grain of salt but not a bucket like all the Bush groupies below me.
B00005MCX3|5.0|This album represents my first Hawkwind listening experience, and I'm proud of that. While it isn't the only good album that the band ever released, it was the perfect gateway CD into a more intense obsession with the band's music. Compared to Doremi Fasol Latido, this album seems somehow more balanced. It is full of crazy spacey sound effects, yet in my opinion doesn't overuse these effects. The use of mellotron, calimba, oboe, and all the other more expected instruments work together perfectly. And, to be honest, while I didn't care much for the remixes, two of the bonus songs (&quot;Paradox&quot; and &quot;It's So Easy&quot;) add great value to this album, as well as what in my opinion is a better ending (assuming the original edition ended on &quot;Goat Willow&quot;). I review my musical purchases two ways: by whether or not I want to listen to it over and over again after I get it and get into the music, and whether, after I've given it a rest for a while, I can pick up the album and experience the same satisfaction from listening to it. &quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot; passed the test with flying colours.<BR>The first song had me hooked. &quot;Psychedelic Warriors (Disappear In Smoke)&quot; is my favourite track on the album. Long before I got a feel for other great songs like &quot;D-Rider&quot;, &quot;Web Weaver&quot;, &quot;You'd Better Believe It&quot; and &quot;Lost Johnny&quot;, I was listening to the opening track over and over again.<BR>I used to love putting this CD in my discman and going for long walks in a nearby park, in the bright afternoon sun. It seems the perfect soundtrack for such days.
0316776963|5.0|I though this book was amazingly funny and brought out new ideas for me, and new ways to look at the world im living in, not just on te surface but beneath every little thing we do. Everything he talked about, his friends, family, lifestyle was well detailed, and never verbose.Wonderful writer.
B00005MCX2|5.0|Hawkwind's music was recommended to me by a friend in the alt.devilbunnies newsgroup a long time ago, and I don't regret following up on their advice. This was the second album I had ever purchased from the band, and since the first was &quot;Hall of the Mountain Grill&quot;, I had high expectations of live material. And, while I can't know if my friend's assessment of &quot;this is the only live Hawkwind album you'll ever need&quot; is true because it's the only live Hawkwind album I have, I can say it was worth the shipping wait, worth the money, and then some. And, might I add, the almost art deco cover art captures the spirit of the album perfectly. This is hands down the best live album I've ever purchased, and a must-have for any Hawkwind fan.<BR>It begins with intrigue, with &quot;Earth Calling&quot;, a seeming jumble of noise, and that enters perfectly into &quot;Born to Go&quot;. From then on, all of Disc 1 works together seamlessly, from the actual music to Robert Calvert's spoken poetry (written by both Calvert and famous sword-and-sorcery novellist Michael Moorcock). Disc 2 is more of the same greatness. While the bonus material isn't seamlessly connected to the rest of the songs, it does add value to the album as a whole.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|I enjoyed this film thoroughly. Perhaps more for its few subtleties and heart-twisting moments of pathos than for all of the outrageous and shocker elements. Contrary to most of the reviewers, I thought Macauley Culkin was suberb. He made the absolute most of each scene, performing with the camera in the most symbiotic manner I have seen since Anthony Perkins in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Seth Green was a knock-out, totally compelling as the witty, jaded, but basically decent James St. James. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the film itself needs much rework. In order to be a latter day 'Cabaret' as I am sure this film aspires, on some level to be, it would have been a good idea to look to past film masterpieces that address historically decadent times and places in the most effective cinematic manner. Too much of Party Monster needs polish and much better editing. <br /> <br />No regrets though, I will watch it again if only for the chance to experience a world that was here and gone as fast as a Fourth of July fireworks display.
B000059XY5|5.0|Michael Keaton returns as the dark knight in this thrilling sequel to the smash original movie.  Its Christmas in Gotham City and there have been sightings of a creature called the Penguin, who is living in the sewers underneath the city. <br /> <br />Christopher Walken stars as Max Shreck, a businessman who wants to build a power plant in Gotham.  Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Selina Kyle, Max's secretaty, but she has her own alter-ego. <br /> <br />Max is giving a Christmas speech when suddenly, a group of mobsters appears and begins shooting everything in sight.  The bat signal is flashed to summon Batman's help.  Soon, Batman is speeding on his way in the Batmobile.  But is Shreck really as he seems?  Is he the \\"Santa of Gotham\\", or is he really collaborating with the Penguin, played superbly by Danny DeVito.  Penguin asks Shreck's help in \\"finding himself\\", and he resorts to blackmailing Shreck to get what he wants.  Max agrees to help Penguin in his scheme. <br /> <br />Selina does some research on Max's proposed power plant and she discovers that the plant will not be producing power, but sucking it from Gotham instead.  Shreck, after finding out what Selina knows, throws her out of a window.  However, Selina survives the fall and is soon surrounded by dozens of cats.  She appears to have gained power from them.  Next, she is making a very sexy leather cat costume.  She has become Catwoman. <br /> <br />Penguin appears in Gotham Square and states that he wishes to find his parents and ask them why they abandoned him.  He goes to the Hall of Records to see if he can find any information.  Bruce Wayne is also digging up information on the Penguin.  Penguin discovers that his name is Oswald Cobblepot.  People throughout Gotham are embracing Penguin as a hero of sorts. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Catwoman makes her first appearance in Gotham. <br /> <br />Bruce and Max have a meeting and Bruce explains that he won't be supporting Max's power plant.  Bruce also tells Maxthat he believes Penguin is the head of the Red Triangle gang.  Max then tries to convince Penguin to run for Mayor of Gotham.  Penguin agrees to run. <br /> <br />Catwoman is wreaking havoc in a department store and Batman and Penguin meet just as the department store explodes.  Catwoman and Batman have their own confrontation. <br /> <br />Catwoman then goes to Penguin to form an alliance to get rid of Batman.  Bruce encounters Selina on the street and invites her to his house where things get a little heated up between them. <br /> <br />Another battle ensues between Batman and Catwoman, and Penguin's thugs have sabotaged the Batmobile.  The Ice Princess, played by Cristi Conaway, was captured and released by Catwoman and left on the ledge of a building.  She slips and falls off the ledge, but the onlookers below think Batman pushed her.  In the meantime, Penguin's and Catwoman's alliance seems to be coming apart. <br /> <br />Penguin continues his campaign for mayor, blaming the current mayor's reliance on Batman as the source of the city's problems.  Bruce uses his computer to break into Penguin's speech transmission and play negative comments Penguin made about Gotham over the speakers.  Soon, the crowd is booing Penguin and leaving.  Penguin seeks refuge back in the sewers, where he hatches a plan to kidnap all of the first-born children of Gotham. <br /> <br />Max is hosting a party, and Bruce attends, along with Selina.  Selina has a plan to kill Max.  She repeats something to Bruce she said as Catwoman, and Bruce does the same to Selina.  They both then realize who the other is.  An enormous explosion rocks the building and Penguin arrives on a large rubber duck.  He reveals his plan to kidnap the children of Gotham and takes Max's son Chip with him, but Max convinces Penguin to take him instead. <br /> <br />Penguin has strapped small missiles to the backs of his penguins to launch into Gotham, but Batman manages to jam the launch signal and turn the penguins around.  He homes in on the origin of the signal to find Penguin's hiding spot.  Penguin tries to escape, only to be confronted by Batman.  the bats attack Penguin, and the penguins' missiles are launched at Penguin's hide out, reducing it to a pile of rubble.  Catwoman shows up and confronts Max.  Batman arrives and says that Max is going to jail, much to the chagrin of Catwoman.  Batman removes his mask, revealing his identity as Bruce, but Selina is not interested in becoming involved with him.  Max has witnessed everything and fires shots at Bruce and Selina.  Bruce's body armor protects him, and Selina electrocutes Max. <br /> <br />Penguin, having fallen into contaminated water, dies from the exposure to the contaminants.  In the end, we see the bat signal with Catwoman underneath. <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie.  The special effects are great, but the best part of the movie is by far Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.  She was the perfect choice for this role.  Watching her sneak around Gotham in her black skin-tight outfit is definitely fun to watch.  Danny DeVito is excellent as the Penguin, and Michael Keaton is great as Batman.  I highly recommend this movie.  It is a dazzling adventure that will leave you breathless.
0465043550|5.0|Finance is a difficult and recondite subject, perhaps second only to mathematics in its inability to inspire excitement in most readers. Yet Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson, co-authors of this book, manage to turn financial math into a great yarn, full of interesting characters and dramatic events. Some of what the book actually says will be old news to market professionals, but it says it quite interestingly. Mandelbrot did some of his most important financial work in the 1960s, but his ideas about leptokurtosis (which deals with the shape of probability functions), fractals (which deal with repetitive patterns) and such have received quite a bit of subsequent attention in trading rooms and in the finance departments of major universities. So, perhaps, it is merely a dramatic device that this book presents Mandelbrot as a solitary, clear-thinking prophet struggling against a blind and hostile economic orthodoxy. That presentation certainly succeeds as drama - the story races along and the reader keeps rooting harder and harder for Mandelbrot to win. The co-authors have spun an excellent saga that says important things in a new way. We think every investor, every business journalist and every financial professional ought to read this book.
B000286RNY|5.0|One of our children saw an ad for this movie on TV and was intrigued because it sort of resembled Kung Pow by Steve Odekerk.  We obtained a copy and were delighted.  Shaolin Soccer is fresh, funny and the special effects are great; it was better than Kung Pow and not nearly as cheesy.  Stephen Chow spoofs films from the Matrix to Kill Bill in his own inimitable Chinese way.  The story takes place in Asia, where main character Sing leaves his shaolin temple to seek his way in the world, specifically in the world of soccer.  His foot of steel and bad shoes leave indelible impressions on those he meets---and beats---along his journey to the world cup games.  He unwittingly captures the heart of a young woman and remains blissfully ignorant of her attraction to him, even when she repairs his tattered shoes with cute little Japanese animal stickers and patches.  The bad guys crop up predictably enough, but are nasty and it's great to see them gloat first and lose later.  The best scenes involve the other shaolin brothers when they emerge from their spiritual seclusion to join Sing in his quest for a championship.  Our family really enjoyed this movie and are glad we made the investment to own it.  It's a real pity that the film never made it big in the USA.  Obscure or not, Shaloin Soccer is a real treat of a genre comedy and will no doubt develop its own richly deserved cult following.
077106506X|5.0|This was a wonderful book. I collect books of short stories because I like stories I can read in one sitting and this is up there with the top ten series of short stories I have encountered (right up there with Bedtime Stories for Women and The Best of Edgar Allen Poe).  The writing is brilliant, the stories are interesting and intriguing. I think it is geared more towards women but men would enjoy it too.
B00005JNEI|5.0|(...)    If there are so many lies in this movie, why are there no lawsuits against Moore for defamation?  The fact is, everything in this movie can be traced back to cold hard facts, if it couldn't, it would not be allowed to be released as a documentary, and there would be tons of lawsuits against Mr. Moore right now, but there aren't, because you can't disprove anything.  (...)  Did he come up with his own conclusion after reading and assembling the facts?  Of course!  Did G.W.Bush come up with his own conclusion after reading and manupulating the facts on WMD's in Iraq?  Of course.  C'mon, Everybody's doing it.  Peer pressure rocks.
B000683VI4|5.0|I knew this movie would be good as soon as I read the synopsis for it. The acting is flawless, the story is very moving, I'd recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see a phenominal love story. There aren't very many movies of this magnitude made nowadays. If this picture doesn't get best original screenplay and best actor James Garner, then I'll have lost faith in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. I don't care what movies you are mainly into, you have to rent or buy this when it comes out. It truly is a beautiful film.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I think Sarah deserves 5 stars for this album. The more I listen to it the more I like it.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|My rating is for the show... for the 5 great guys in the band... but not the greedy record company and the worst DVD production team. <br /> <br />The production is crap regarding 5.1 surround sound. The half of show after \\"New Millenium\\" is unbearable. It seems that the DVD mess up with the 5.1 channels. How come there is major sound problem for a concert DVD? Did the production team really see/listen the DVD sample before mass production? <br /> <br />I just wonder why it is still selling and not recalled. I really warn you not to buy this crap before record company fix the problem. BTW, I suggest to mail back the flewed disc to record company after u get the new version.... hope it will go stright to the responsible person....
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I was very apprehensive about seeing this movie, believing that Ashton Kutcher in a beard has to mean that he is trying too hard to market himself as something that he's not.  People probably thought the same way when Mel Gibson played \\"Hamlet\\" in the '80's.<br /><br />But Mel Gibson was great in \\"Hamlet\\", and Kutcher is actually pretty good in \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", as well.  He avoids for the most part Keanu-esque awkward moments that make the viewer cringe and pulls off a believable-enough performance as a college student whose realities just aren't what they used to be.<br /><br />The story follows his character for 13 years from childhood to college, during which times he is prone to blackouts that he can't explain that have great effect on the direction his life takes.  In his desire to determine their cause and to regain the memory he lost during their occurrance, he finds that he has the ability to literally revisit his childhood (as well as his adolescence), returning to the exact point in time when he lost consciousness before...only upon his return he maintains the consciousness and the knowledge he had as a young adult.<br /><br />Ultimately he decides that with the hindsight of an adult, he can, as a child, change the course of events that brought unhappiness to himself, his mother, and his friends.  This has the effect of changing any number of other things that happens consequently, and as a result the present that he realizes changes each time he \\"wakes up\\".<br /><br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" comparisons are inevitable...the afflicted yet brilliant young man, the malicious company he keeps, the \\"stitch in time\\" plot in general...anyone who was a fan of one movie should definitely appreciate the other.  The \\"director's cut\\" edition is particularly satisfying if you're looking for an ending that is essentially the antithesis of the moral found in the Christmas classic \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\".<br /><br />It's a good movie.  The continuity obsessives will no doubt have a field day complaining about every little detail that the producer missed, but this is only a movie and the suspension of at least SOME disbelief should be accorded.  I don't think I'm totally sold on Ashton making his living in dramatic roles, but he was a lot better than I was initially willing to give him credit for, and it does show that he's a lot more versatile than the other teeny flicks he's made outside of \\"That '70's Show\\".ill no doubt have a field day complaining about every little detail that the producer missed, but this is only a movie and the suspension of at least SOME disbelief should be accorded.

(im steph, cushla's 14 y.o. daughter) ever since i was a little kid, i LOVED it! i was 2 years old when it came out. i have no recollection of watching it, (it mustve been before i can remember) but i remember that i wathced it because i recognized what people or books or whatever were talking about it, or in pictures n stuff. <br />i forgot about the whole thing for a few years when other stuff was on my mind, but lately im practically obsessed with it! :P LISTEN TO ME: YOU HAVE GOT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE, NO MATTER HOW YOUNG OR OLD! PARENTS, MAKE YOUR KIDS WATCH IT THEY WILL LOVE IT! THIS IS A CLASSIC! EVEN TODAY PEOPLE LOVE IT! HOT TOPIC STORES ARE FULL THE STUFF! GO THERE AND GET IT! <br />Kingdom Hearts, a video game relaesed last year er sumthin has Halloweentown in it. It has all the characters n everhthing. great game.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Okay. First the complaints. <br /> <br />There were some totally obvious computer graphics shots thrown in, like the one where the wolf lunges at the bars of the cage in the zoo or whatever. That stunk.  <br /> <br />Also, some of the scenes kind of predictable. Like in the beginning set, in Alaska or Antarctica or wherever, and the shelf begins to break, the main character has to of course jump across the already large gap, make it, grab some beloved test tube thingies, and jump back just in the nick of time. That was incredibly stupid of him. <br /> <br />One last minor complaint I have is the cover of the movie. It looks like a cover for a low-budget film. Don't go by that. <br /> <br />Okay, that's all the complaining I have for now.  <br /> <br />Now the good points. One thing that exceeded my expectations was how they thoroughly explained why the world was supposedly heading into a new ice age. That was very cool. It proved that whoever wrote the original book/script knew what they were writing about. Very believable. I don't want to stray off topic but another movie with that cool aspect is Alien Vs. Predator ;) <br /> <br />I also liked those dramatic shots of the tsunami waves hitting the Statue of Liberty. They were awesome. Actually, I liked the whole part with the tidal waves rolling into New York City, though the couple of shots with the Statue of Liberty were still better. ...And I thought the waves at Jones Beach were huge O_o.... <br /> <br />I also liked how the movie wasn't totally intense. I mean, it wasn't what you would call 'light', but it still allowed some people to crack a couple of jokes. I don't know about you, but I can't watch a movie that doesn't pause to take a break with the non-stop action. <br /> <br />There are more good points to the movie; but those are just a couple for you to ponder. My advice is that you watch this movie. It really is great. It exceeded my expectations, and it should do the same for you.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Know before you view it that Fahrenheit 9/11 is a powerful film that brings home great suffering and even greater absuridity.  Moore does a good job of dealing with subjects that are unpleasant by mixing in humor, but you still walk away with a sense of tragedy and anger over what this government is doing to people. I saw it three times in the theatre and will buy it this week and watch it again. It opens your eyes to what is going on. It's heavy, makes you cry, makes you angry, and motivates you to implement some regime change right here at home.<br /><br />It portrays the truth most Americans, especially the right-of-center ones, do not want to see. The reactionary right HATES Michael Moore because he exposes their fundamental strategy: the use of fear to divide and manipulate people. Like he did in \\"Bowling for Columbine,\\" Moore shows how fear is a powerful weapon that can be used to trick people into believing things that are not true and acting against their own best interest. The fact that Moore can deliver this message with wit, flair, and most amazingly, in a way that is entertaining, is iodine in the wounds of the reactionaries.<br /><br />For me, the most poignant moment in the film is when Lila Libscomb is weeping over the death of her son, a soldier killed in Iraq, and a nasty woman jumps in front of her and the camera shouting \\"this is all staged.\\" Then she demands Libscomb to tell her where her son was killed. When Libscomb replies without hesitation and gives the exact time and place of her son's death, the nasty woman recoils realizing it isn't staged at all, then stomps away angry. That is an allegory of right-wing reaction to much in the world.<br /><br />Moore can be criticized for jumping through the facts too quickly and of not going into depth when called for. However, he can not be faulted on the factual content of the film. The reactionaries rail and moan but they never can find anything in Fahrenheit 9/11 that is untrue.<br /><br />Bless you, Michael Moore for showing such heart and such courage.>Bless you, Michael Moore for showing such heart and such courage.

Compared to the book, the film is about as humourous as Schindler's List. <br />Bridget's low self-esteem, parental and relationship issues are instantly relatable and told in such a witty way that I found myself bursting out with laughter while reading it. <br />Beware of drinking hot beverages while reading this gem, as poorly timed laughter may cause them to spew forth from our nose!

B0002MB7QW|5.0|The Day After Tomarrow was a good movie. It was about a really big storm that puts the entire northern hemisphere into a iceage and a scientists son is stuck in it and the scientist guy goes to get him. The only bad part is that some parts in the begining are boring but the rest is really good. If you like movies about storms and stuff watch this movie.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|At first glance I saw Celine Dion and Anne Geddes... my heart kind of sunk. Did it mean that she was going to be singing with a photographer about babbies? I was a little unsure. Yet, it is a Celine Dion album and I am a big fan of her work, so I bought it and popped into my car CD player. There was no loud bombastic opening anthem or chest thumping declaration of life. Instead, my ears were greated with soft stringsand a simple melody. her voice was soft and delicate and I loved it instantly. \\"Miracle\\" is an album of well crafted songs and the instrumentation serves to compliment her amazing voice. A little disapointing was the inclusion of three songs that have appeared on her other albums. \\"Brahms' Lullaby\\" is the exact rendition that appears on her holiday album, \\"A Mother's Prayer\\" is the same song that appears on the Quest For Camelot soundtrack, and \\"The First time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" was on her greatest hits collection. While each of those three songs are beautiful they only serve as missteps on this collection of \\"new\\" recordings. That aside, i love the music. It's theme is so soothing in concept that it acctually makes me feel so relaxed and ready to live my own life. Sure, these songs are meant to signify new life, and they do that so well. Celine Dion does an amazing job of showing restraint and blasting her vocals in her trademark fashion. \\"Miracle\\" is chocked full of songs that I'm sure critics will clamor to call shlocky and syrupy sweet, but what is to be expected on an album dedicated to the beauty of newborn babies! A great album... all the way.

B00000255F|5.0|Born to Run ranks, IMO, just behind Born in the USA and Darkness on the Edge of Town as The Boss's best work. You can't beat songs like Born to Run or Thunder Road, which are still popular to this day. Night, Backstreets, and Tenth Avenue Freeze Out are great songs in their own right. Don't forget Jungleland, with that violin opening that makes it a unique song in Springsteen's work.<br /><br />I recommend this album if you're just getting into Bruce Springsteen's music. Also, check out Born in the USA and Darkness on the Edge of Town.
6300267881|3.0|its a bit slow in parts i think.a little girl gets posessed by a demon and a priest comes to try and exorcise it.it looks all low budget.theres a few versions.i think this one is best.its pretty intense,many people get scared off.the very fact that a little girl is the victim is pretty lewd i think.its supposed to be true but somehow i doubt it.its very psycologicly tormenting.theres the girls mom whose no spring chicken and a little girl,so the chick element is non-existant!the demon acts as the clerics assistants mom and really messes with his head.the important message is,dont mess with demons,but if you must,be prepared!the entire movie is extremely intense!the special effects blow.every so often they redo this movie.theres been 3 so far so maybe by 2015 0r so there will be another one.
B0000025D0|5.0|While I still think Born in the USA is The Boss's best album, Darkness on the Edge of Town is right behind it. This album is loaded with great songs, including Badlands, Adam Raised a Cain, Prove It All Night, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Candy's Room, and Racing in the Street.  <br /> <br />If you're just discovering Bruce Springsteen's music, I definitely recommend this album, along with Born in the USA and Born to Run.

B000002513|3.0|This isn't a bad album, but not one of my favorites from The Boss. It's better than Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ, but pales in comparison to his later albums. The best songs on this album are Rosalita and Fourth of July, Asbury Park (Sandy). Both of those are very catchy tunes.
B00005NKW3|3.0|this story is about santa claus coming to a town and being comitted and even tried.the kids will like it.a cool saying from the movie is\\"youve heard of the french nation,and the british nation.well this is the imagination\\".thats pretty clever!its one of the top 10 best x-mas movies.santas out trying to prove hes the real deal.its an abselutely magical and touching tale.the important message is....do you really knowwhat reality is?could you?
0393035158|1.0|This book reminds me why Faith needs to be so strong.  When you have Faith, the small-mindedness of this author cannot fail to touch you as ignorant--and this book as pitiable at best.  <br /> <br />In an attempt to explain away the sheer strength that Faith brings to our lives by replacing it with an anti-belief, is merely trading one faith for another.  And to believe in nothing is the weakest belief there is. <br /> <br />The multitudes who have collectively hailed this book as exceptional seem to miss the point of Faith entirely, as the author himself has, bringing a different type of dogma into being.       <br /> <br />Just another bandwagon philosophy (like so many religions are), made obvious by the peanut gallery of reviewers listed here.  <br /> <br />
B00005Q4GV|3.0|this is about the greatest general in the second world war,george patton!he gets in,shapes up the platoon,and goes (...)!its an excellent war movie too.there are better though.full metal jacket,deer hunter to name a couple.any history or war buff should dig this one.its true.patton belived in reincarnation and even wrote poetry.of course,he belived he was a warrior in many of his past lives and thats innaccurate as far as reincarnation goes.well,spiritual lesson aside,its good.watch it!
B0002Z0EYA|1.0|A waste of $200 million dollars Plus. I cannot see how some people raved about this film. I went in looking forward to seeing this immensely and was terribly disappointed. I had scant knowledge of Homer (never read any of his books) and the only knowledge I had of Troy was from various films and history lessons etc. All I was after was an enjoyable experience for a couple of hours. I came out wondering how anyone could make such a kipper of a film while trying to do the opposite. It was massively to long and every time anyone of any importance died we went over to the funeral pyre scene again and again and again and again, if someone died then we could have shown this once to let the audience know how they were disposed of after death but to do this EVERTIME was just ridiculous (they must have been running out of coins to put over the eyes by the end of this turkey). Julie Christie's scenes could have been cut in their entirety and the story would not have missed a beat and I could have got out 10 minutes sooner. I have nothing against any of the actors they all did what they were supposed to do, Brad Pitt was heroic, Orlando Bloom was vain and selfish as the part required and  Eric Bana having the best part of Hector was suitably brave and self sacrificing - and yes we saw his funeral pyre as well. The people who were to blame were the director Wolfgang Petersen (awful), the editor Peter Honess and the scriptwriter David Bienhoff's. The cinematography is awful, with night-time shots so dark you can't see a damn thing, but by the end I wasn't complaining. Where is it said that for a film to be called an epic it must be over long and if they wanted to make this long they should have spent more time on building up the characters and less on burning them. The saving grace was the excellent secondary actors who made this film a one star rather than a no star review
B00000F3KL|3.0|bill clinton did this horrible military work.we couldnt hang with some rebels in africa?are you serious?thats why draft dodgers shouldnt be president.i didnt vote for him.the u.s. goes to africa to calm down some rebel forces and cant hang.its too much for small kids.as far as military movies go,it outranks many of them but doesnt hold up with war greats like full metal jacket and deer hunter.those interested in real life stories,history or the military will really like this movie.theres one part where the troops have to do a civil war style amputation on a wounded soul.its pretty nasty!its definately true.who could think about chicks during guierilla warfare?that dude,matt damon is in it.i dont like him but hes in a number of good movies like dogma.dogma is better id say.the important message is strike hard strike first strike fast.if they would have just gone in and laid the smack like nixon,we wouldnt have this black mark on our otherwise  near perfect record.

6300216039|3.0|theres one real flaw in which this guy gets stabbed and every time the camera gets back on him the bloodstain is in a different place.romeo and juliette are from fueding families.they are forbidden to see eachother but do anyhow.they eventualy elope.they end up killing thierselves much later each thinking the other had perished.of course the man or myth william shakesspere wrote this one.its considered the greatest love story ever told.personaly i like mickey and mallorey knox better.i think the fact that they killed thierselves over eachother is repulsive.no chick would really do that since they are all so stuck on thierselves and the guy is an idiot too for chicks only love themselves.its emotional if you are.some of the chicks are ok in a 100 year old plus kind of way.im sure thier style made them real lookers at the time.another thing is their stupid parents need to chill out as do all parents.girls are going to grow up,get thier hormones raging and get down with a guy.get over it!its part of life!
B00008AOS5|3.0|I have to be completely honest.  As interesting a character Hannibal Lector is, I really haven't enjoyed the Hannibal Lector movies that much.  This goes against the popular vein, but other than the acting and some interesting cinematographic effects, I wasn't impressed by SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; MANHUNTER (the original film based off of the novel Red Dragon) was a colorful piece of cinematic art quite creative in its use of lighting, sound, and color; and though I enjoyed HANNIBAL the most of Lector movies, it is very violent and unbelievable absurd.  Nevertheless, I was looking forward to watching RED DRAGON, the prequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and remake of Michael Mann's MANHUNTER. With Anthony Hopkins back as Dr. Hannibal Lector, the brilliant Edward Norton playing detective Will Graham, and the mysterious Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dolarhyde (aka \\"The Tooth Fairy\\") I thought the movie would be the best of them all.  I should be used to movie disappointments by now.<br /><br />The movie begins with prologue illustrating how Will Graham was able to successfully capture Dr. Hannibal Lector. The movie then fast forwards in time three years. A new serial killer is loose killing entire families one an evening when there is a full moon. Graham's former boss at the FBI asks him to come out retirement to help track the madman down.  After some internal conflict, soul searching, and weighing the risks Graham agrees. The case proves more difficult than anyone thought and even with the assistance of Dr. Lector, no major leads are discovered.  But the killer, \\"The Tooth Fairy\\", like the legendary Frankenstein's monster, ends up falling in love with a blind girl.  She is oblivious to his flaws.  Touched by grace, the killer falls deeper and deeper into a confusing downward spiral of self-loathing and bittered anger.<br /><br />On the surface, the movie is interesting and entertaing enough. The prologue at the beginning of the movie is brilliant and makes the movie watching solely for that. However, the deeper elements I was expected from the film just weren't there. Edward Norton is a great actor, but he's much too young to play Will Graham and just wasn't able to capture the internal epic struggle that Graham feels throughout.  Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always. However, Ralph Fiennes' talent wasn't used as the role of Francis Dolarhyde seemed to be cut down to a cardboard caricature more than a real life flesh and blood character. Philip Seymour Hoffman (Freddy Lounds), Emily Watson (Reba McClane), and Harvey Keitel (Jack Crawford) did wonderful jobs in their supporting roles, but it isn't enough to counter-balance Norton's miscasting and Fiennes' lack of a meaty role.<br /><br />Also missing in this film were any elements that would lend it some credibility as a crime drama/thriller. I didn't enjoy MANHUNTER very much, but Michael Mann at least played around with light, color, and sound to produce an ode of moving art. RED DRAGON has none of that.  There aren't any outstanding images and the movie's score and soundtrack are seriously lacking. Besides the prologue at the beginning, the pacing of the movie also seems slow, almost too slow for a thriller such as RED DRAGON.  In fact, for all intense purposes, RED DRAGON is basically the same type of movie that Hollywood churns out all the time, only with a talented (but misused) cast and a very interesting prologue.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series, RED DRAGON is worth watching. Other than that, the film really isn't a must see, but is fun to watch on a weekend if you have nothing better to see.solely for that.

B00008DDHY|3.0|back many many years ago,the english took over........well pretty much everything.ireland included.the potato famine is really just some bull they put up to cover for the fact that they were starving the irish to death by attacking or taking all thier food sources.the irish are still under english rule now.theyre mad as anything,understandably.the ira and just about anybody else fights guierrilla style all the time against the english.the irish wanted to do a march in northern ireland commerating a victory over the english which was really inconsequential now.the english armed guards were everywhere and this irish guy led hundreds of people out to this march against unbeatable odds and unlawfully.his reasons were half baked,like martin king was his idol.first of all,martin king was a guy who cared nothing for the irish only africans.they marched and as expected,they were shot dead.its sad and sorry but you dont peacefully assemble against armed guards.its a documentary type film.its cheaply done.it is quite true.for the irish,its got to be indescribably horrible.the important messages are many.FREE IRELAND!many other once english ruled places are free now like china and india.theyve made thier point.give it up already!and lastly,the only real difference between a fool and a hero is wether or not you were sucessful.no one is going to remember the irish king wanna be as ca hero for leading his lambs to slaughter.

0385512104|5.0|This book was told from the point of view of a autistic fifteen year old boy who understands numbers, animals, science and shapes more than humans. He can be both logical and illogical at the same time. To him, a lucky day, is a day where he can see 4 yellow vehicles on the way to school. And the day would be an unlucky day if he sees 4 red vehicles! His favorite food is defined by colors! He hates food that are yellow and brown in color. And, he notices and remembers everything. He memorizes details like the number of cows on the field as well as the patches on the cow. So, new places terrifies him... <br /> <br />It's full of humor and the author did a fantastic job in relating the story from the point of view of a autistic boy. <br />
B00001IVOF|5.0|This is a must have for any Mobb Deep Album. The beats are straight up gangsta and theres no sign of any mainstream on this album. Most of the new rappers today have destroyed the true meaning of hip hop and have turned it into hip pop music. What is up with this garbage. The beats in this album are the scary type and grimy gritty and unpleasant as it represents the true streets of gang life and New York/Queensbridge streets. Although I presonally think  The Infamous is the better one, this is definetely worth taking a look at. BRING THE TRUE HIP HOP BACK!!
0316921173|5.0|This is a great book, and im not going to go into the many reasons for which it is, in fact, a great book, because there are plenty of other reviews here to do that.  However, in order to tackle this behemoth effectively, you are going to need a few things: <br /> <br />A Dictionary.  Yes, i know you are smart and well read but trust me here.  I didnt even OWN a dictionary... i went out and bought one. <br /> <br />Two Bookmarks.  Thats right, 2!  One to mark your \\"active\\" page and one for the footnotes section.  That way, you can jump right to the corresponding footnote page, without losing your active page, because some of those notes are quite involved. <br /> <br />After I finished this book i came across the companion to it, which i thouroughly enjoyed.  However i prefer to enjoy the book on its own, then peruse the companion, but suit yourself.
B0002JJBZE|4.0|Anyone who buys, just be aware that you get the DVD's in a simple binder that is held together by a single strip of tape.

B000001FTQ|3.0|Buying time in the midst of the two-and-a-half-year hiatus between THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE and THE JOSHUA TREE, U2 dropped this four-song, half-live/half-studio EP on its American audience in the latter part of 1985. Like most such offerings, it's really designed for fans of the group, but it works reasonably well as a souvenir of the UNFORGETTABLE FIRE tour, not to mention a chance to hear a couple of B-sides previously unissued in North America.     \\"Bad\\" and \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" were two of the stronger tracks on THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, but these live versions are really only essential for the completist, as the first song has actually become a far stronger concert number in the years since its release (Check out the version on the ELEVATION 2001 - LIVE IN BOSTON video for a comparison), while the second definitely loses something without the Brian Eno/Daniel Lanois studio tweaking that gave the original performance its effecting atmosphere.     As for the studio songs, \\"The Three Sunrises\\" is a prime bit of FIRE-era U2: bright, poppy, joyously anthemic and altogether different from the moody album the band had just released. The self-produced \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" is somewhat slower and more somber, but still a truer song with a stronger beat than some of the ambient experiments on THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE. Both of these tracks were reissued on the B-SIDES disc which accompanied the first pressing of THE BEST OF 1980-1990, but unfortunately that collection itself is now six years out of print, leaving hardcore fans no chioce but to add WIDE AWAKE IN AMERICA to their collections.
B000002MP2|5.0|I never thought I'd see another good punk album after 'Rocket to Russia' and 'London Calling' but I was proved wrong with this masterpiece. This is true punk of the ninties...and its mainstream too! I never thought I'd see a good punk album that has hit it big, thats so rare to find now especially with poseurs like Gay Charlotte, S*!*ty Plan and especially the biggest poseur ever AVRIL LAVIGNE!!! ARGH, I HATE HER!!! I know this was released in the mid-ninties but still there were very crappy punk poseur bands back then too (Blink 182 anyone?) and no true punk band ever got attention since the early eighties. Well about this album: Its just plain freakin' awesome! Thats the best way I can describe it without reaching the vulgar point and getting my review erased. This is a punk classic among punk classics! The only punk albums that I can think of that are better than this are Rocket to Russia, Never Mind the Bollucks and London Calling, which are all masterpieces. Every song on here is at least a 7/10 with many 9s and 10s, that means that basically every song on here is inspired and you will most likely have no filler. If you are new to Green Day then start here, at the best one, then go to the next ones until you hit the new Retard, or Idiot or something like that, 'cause I heard it wasn't as good but you should still get it anyway. Just buy this great album, you wont regret it...seriously.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I have never actually seen this movie, but my friend ed(not his real name...security reasons...I think you understand....whatta you mean if you really loved me you would tell....why do you always have to bring that up?  Look I told you, it was a scavanger hunt!  Nobody was too upset, the only one who really dwells on it is you; and you weren't even supposed to see that), anywhoo, Ed said this movie was really good.  And trust him (finest sonuvabitch to have in a foxhole with you). One time he told me about this place that served Italian Beef that was the best ever.  Well I went there, and it was good but not great.  So I get home and I say hey ed, it was pretty good, but what the heck?  Well turns out I had gone to the wrong place, so I went to the actual resturant that Ed had recommended, and it was dang good.  So the moral of this story is TRUST ED!  Also, if you happen to find a day planner at this restaurant..it's denim, got a picture of a kitten on it and says hang loose. Tell me.
6305633177|5.0|Oh how I miss Master Burton. Its so unfortunate that he died when his tour bus flipped over and it was all the more sad that I found this out when I just became a huge fan of his. He is God of bass and can really be matched by no bass player, not even John Deacon (Queen) or John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), hell they dont even come within a hundred lightyears of Cliffs godliness. Cliff deserved so much more than what he got and its videos like these that remind me of the good old days of Metallica, not when they and they're music went to hell with 'Load'. <br />   When Cliff died it only led me to believe \\"What if?\\" and that question has been plaguing my thoughts ever since. If Cliff hadn't been killed than it seems to me that Metallica WOULD release the follow up to Master of Puppets called ...And Justice for All but wouldn't release crap like the Loads or St. Anger. Maybe they would have made thrash popular and destroy hairmetal before horrible grunge (besides Nirvana) and nu-metal surfaced. Cliff you were the heart of Metallica and without you the band will never relive what they started, may God rest your soul and lead you to...ETERNAL THRASH!!!! YEAH WE KNOW YOU WANT THAT! <br />  Right, about this DVD. This really brings out the Godliness of Burton with 'Sanitarium' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' being the best live songs. James, Kirk and Lars arent half bad themselves in fact they really are quite amazing here as well but its Master Burton that really shines on this DVD. I couldn't really say anything that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece. So this is for ANY Metallica fan that is willing to spend $20, which shouldn't be too difficult. Just buy it dammit and see the Jimi Hendrix of bass!

B00004S6GL|5.0|i owned figure 8 for two years and hardly ever listened to it. i preferred the elliot smith of either/or and could not get into these big musical ballads.  The only song that stuck was, \\"Everything Means Nothing To Me.\\"     <br /> <br />Finally after 2 years i left the cd in my car stereo for a week and forced myself to get to know it.  I was a total tool.  This is a beautiful albulm and I don't know why i couldn't see that before.  When Smith sings \\"why are you staring into outerspace crying, just because you came acrossed it and lost it?\\" and stretches 'lost' into three syllables my heart breaks.  He was growing so much musically and not many people really 'got it' at the time.   <br /> <br />The metaphors may not hit so deeply on this albulm, but they are there - cloaked by a pop sensibility.  Lines like, \\"I have become a silent movie...can't make a sound,\\"  \\"If I didn't know the difference living alone would probably be OK.  I wouldn't be lonely,\\" are coupled with a range of music that might take a fan of the earlier albulms some time to get used to, but it is well worth it.
630460288X|2.0|Sylvester Stallone slurs his way through another explosion-encased attempt at a movie.  Good God, I'm sorry--but deep down, you know that's how it goes.  I just feel sorry for the guy who has to clean up the bullet blanks at the end of each take (and Stallone's acting coach--ZING!).   <br />Wesley Snipes is in this too as a flamboyant, clown-like gangster with bullets and guns and the intention of wearing parachute pants...that's how his character acts.  But hey, it was the 80's version of the future, so if you didn't have parachute pants or metal shoulder pads, you were pretty much a loser. <br />I think there is a woman in this to, but it was hard to tell through all of the gun smoke. <br /> <br />Stallone would be at the bottom of my list if it wasn't for people like Steven Segal and (most of all) Jean-Claude Van Damme.  Human meatloaf....GOD! <br />

But the 'sound' isn't everything.  The key in music has always been intergrity, honestly, and truthfullness of expression.  For that, Elliot was a true musician.  <br /> <br />This is a great albulm and my favorite.  For a long time I really felt to connection to his later material.  Then, after two years of owning it, I left 'Figure 8' in my car stereo for a week.  Suddenly, i began to realize what an amazing albulm it is.  It might not hit you over the head with it's sorry like Either/Or, but there is so much going on and his talent really shines.
0783225849|5.0|I love this movie.  Anthony Perkins is great as an insane noodley guy.  And the shower scene always makes me fear showering, so I end up loofa-ing instead.  The scene where the detective is killed always makes me fear going up stairs for fear of an unstable killer waiting for me behind a door.  And the last scene always makes me fear turning a chair containing a corpse, then almost getting killed by that same knife wielding killer...Whatta movie.  The mother is definately NOT the son.  Nope.  Definately NOT, so don't try to guess.
B000002BBY|5.0|Say what you will kids, but this was the album of the year 1995. The fact that I still enjoy every single song after 9 years tells me that. Wonderwall, Some Might Say, Don't Look Back In Anger and especially Champaigne Supernova are simply great songs and I admire Noel Gallagher as a songwriter still today. This is one of those albums that I grabbed as soon as it came out, rather than coming to it after a period of time, which I seem to do alot. I'm happy to have it around.
B0001ADAVK|4.0|Here's the rare film from Hollywood that features a cast full of beautiful (mostly young) woman...and is about ideas! A chick flick with feeling and intelligence. Quite the rarity!<br /><br />Based on ideas stolen from Ayn Rand's famous book, \\"The Fountainhead\\", this movie pits new wave scholar Julia Roberts against all-woman Wellesley College and its ultraconservative ways in the 1950s. Roberts seeks to bust out of the mold by teaching modern art, while the students and management of the university seek to keep her in her place. The ending is about what you might expect as both sides get what they want.<br /><br />What I found most remarkable about this film is the cast is full of young woman -- most of whom that made their mark in cheerleader movies -- playing intelligent young Stepford wife sexpots doing intellectual battle with the new teacher. Roberts wins over many of the youngsters but fails in her larger effort -- to fast forward their thinking to the independent women's movement style two decades ahead of the time portrayed in this film.<br /><br />In this way, the flick is akin to a female remake of \\"The Man In the Gray Flannel Suit\\", where Gregory Peck sought to fight against the traditions of his time...and failed. Still, the heroic effort, mated to the relationships and dynamics created by the female cast, is reason to watch this movie. All the beautiful women that cascade to and fro becomes a delightful sidebar.<br /><br />I did not expect to enjoy this film -- much less respect it -- and I avoided it when it came out. My wife wanted to see it, of course. When we finally saw it together, she said she was glad she didn't spend money at the theater on it. In contrast, I found the battle of ideas won me over in a way I did not anticipate.<br /><br />I wish someone other than Julia Roberts played the lead, a more realistic intellectual risk-taker, but that's small potatoes. If you like chick flicks, feel good movies and/or message films with substance, there is much in \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" for you.tance, there is much in \\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" for you.
B000000WA2|5.0|I just recently bought this album, the second blur album i've gotten,(Parklife is the other) and am totally impressed by i'ts cleverness, both lyrical and musical.  Any professed rock music fan who listens to this album and says that it is no good is completely off base. Every song has tags that will stick in the memory. Brilliant music. I will be checking out some more blur!
B000002JKS|4.0|I love this album.  Not that I don't like other Plant solo albums (\\"Pictures\\" and \\"Principle\\" are outstanding) but \\"Shaken\\" is pure Robert Plant (with his original and best band) without any hint of his past or any other influences.  Actually, to be fair, the one influence shown here is the times in which it was recorded (dead center of the 80's).  That happens to be my favorite period in pop music history (late 70's and 80's) just because it was the last truly original period.  Everything since then has been a rehash of other decades.  \\"Shaken 'N Stirred\\" is Robert Plant's final, pure, artistic statement.  All of his efforts since then (although note-worthy on their own) reeked of capturing past glory or desperately searching for pop hit status.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I finally saw this supposed masterwork a short time ago. (Like about 45 minutes.)  <br /> <br />First of all, the movie is downright boring, the last half only shows some interest because of the heart strings being deliberately pulled.  <br /> <br />Secondly, think of the story you're being told.  Not oh-my-god Bush is connected to Carlyle or the war is bad message.  Look at the conspiracy theory Moore is showing us. <br /> <br />Bush and the Bin Ladens were in cahoots and they decided to \\"screw\\" Bush with the 9/11 attacks.  Why?  To gain what?  And after this he helps the Bin Ladens get out of the country.  The war in Afghanistan was really a cover to build an oil pipeline, and Iraq was a peaceful and happy place which we invaded for no reason.  There is no war on terror, and no terrorist threat.  We're kept in fear to to keep society together and the \\"war\\" is only meant to continue.     <br /> <br />That was the message I got from Moore's film, and he can present all the \\"facts\\" and rich people know rich people innuendo he wants but this is ridiculous.  Has anybody who loves this film actually realized this?  Or does it just give so much they want to hear that the unbelievability just doesn't matter?  However, I have a bridge and a plot on the moon I'd like to sell his fans.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Did Universal do this?  I forget.  I cannot believe that they would allow their classic monsters to be turned into NEWSPAPER for the giant pet-store parrot \\"Van Helsing\\". What a joke.  The only good thing this movie did was spark the re-release of the original Universal presentations of Dracula, Wolf-Man, and Frankenstein which were previously un-available for about 2 years or so.  This movie is suck.  Don't waste the cash.  Skip it.  How many more ways can I say it?!  This movie was balls! ZERO STARS!
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|A Fusion of incredible talent.  Dion, with her gift of music and Gedees with her gift of picture. Miracle is indeed a groundbreaking, landmark project.  A project that reminds the listener of exactly why Dion is a global superstar.  <br /> <br />A collection of songs celebrating the love between mother and child.  Dion gets her point across in 13 soft and subtle arrangements.  John Lennon's \\"Beautiful Boy\\", which is particularly enchanting, is the lead single from the album.   <br /> <br />Other familiar hits are sampled on Miracle like Roberta Flack's \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\\" and Barbara Streisand's \\"If I Could\\" along with 9 original compositions for the project.   <br /> <br />Dion is stripped down on this album, no power-ballads here, just Dion's smooth and polished vocals. Miracle is set to be a celebrated, commercially successful, and industry recognized project.  Artists, Critics and music listeners alike who have never given Dion credit for any of her accomplishments, this project will be very hard to ignore.
B00005JLYW|4.0|The first one introduced you to their world, this one picks up and shows the girls loving life and moving through their world with supreme confidence.  'Course there are some bumps in their personal lives and each character has a satisfying thread throughout the movie.  Demi was FANTASTIC as the fallen angel.  The action was kick butt, the stunts were awesome (I loved the Coal Bowl sequence with the professional bikers), and the colors were vibrant and glittery.  Good fun!  I would have given it five but there was a little too much gratuitous nudity and sexuality.  Completely unnecessary.  Other than that, great! <br /> <br />The DVD design could have been a lot better.  LOVED the design of the menus and animation on the first one.  This one misses that boat.
0321213351|5.0|Patterns have always been the domain of the 'architect type'. This book turns that around. It provides practical insight at the code level in how to improve code structure using patterns. What's more it provides these insights on existing code bases. Most of us don't start projects, we extend existing projects. This book tells us how to refactor this existing code in practical ways that will end up making the code more maintainable and reliable. <br /> <br />I can't hold the GoF responsible for the architectural bias in patterns. The original Design Patterns book was very practical in nature. Design patterns just had better penetration in the architecture world. With this book Kerievsky brings patterns back to the front line implementers. <br /> <br />I recommend this book for any software engineer. Thank you Joshua! Great job.
B0000028VT|5.0|It's not hard to see (or hear, rather) why Music Box is Mariah's best-selling album. This was not only the first Mariah album I purchased, but the very first CD I bought (I finally graduated from cassettes in May 1994!!) - and what a stunning start to my CD collection!  <br /> <br />1. Dreamlover - fun and uplifting pop track to open the album. Never fails to get my feet going and put a smile on my face (9/10) <br /> <br />2. Hero - despite being seriously overplayed on radio when it was released, this song is Mariah at her absolute power-ballad and song-writing best...even better is the spin she puts on it when she sings it live, especially with the gospel choir backing her up (e.g. \\"Fantasy\\" concert Madison Square Gardens 1995; the \\"Butterfly\\" concert, which I was truly blessed to go to in 1998 in Perth.) Will always be considered a Mariah classic. (album version 9.5/10; live version with choir 10/10) <br /> <br />3. Anytime You Need A Friend - gospel-like track in the spirit of \\"Lean On Me\\", but more powerful and passionate, Mariah-style. It wasn't my favourite when I first bought the album, but it has grown on me over the years. Mariah's back up singers are fantastic (go Melonie and the Price sisters!!) (7.5/10) <br /> <br />4. Music Box - the title track is simply stunning. The heavenly music, beautiful lyrics and Mariah's amazing, stirring vocals make you feel like you're drifting away to a better place. Just gorgeous. (10/10) <br /> <br />5. Now That I Know - after the calm tranquility of \\"Music Box\\", Mariah teases us with a brief, sweet little piano riff before you're hit with a thumping, upbeat track about finally feeling secure in a relationship. Turn this right up...you won't regret it! Remixes of this track would have been great if was released! (10/10) <br /> <br />6. Never Forget You - almost like a country-pop ballad, but beautiful nonetheless. The lyrics are just beautiful, and reflect perfectly how I felt just after losing my first serious boyfriendat the time (didn't last long though!!) As I've said in previous reviews, it's almost as if Mariah reads my mind with most of the songs she writes. Just amazing. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />7. Without You - this Nilsson cover is the reason I fell in love with Mariah, and why Music Box was my very first CD. Once I heard this, I had to get my hands on the album ASAP! Still my very favourite Mariah song of all time, and I can't begin to tell you how absolutely INCREDIBLE it was to hear her sing it live in '98. So passionate, so powerful, yet so bittersweet. Mariah shines (11/10!!!!) <br /> <br />8. Just To Hold You Once Again - everytime Mariah's stirring lyrics and melodies are blended with Walter Afanasieff's beautiful instrumentations, magic happens! It's truly a musical match made in heaven. This is one of those. (10/10) <br /> <br />9. I've Been Thinking About You - another upbeat pop song to break up the ballads (I'd have still been just as happy if this was a ballad-only album!) Lyrically, I love this track. If it was cut more as a dance track (like \\"Now That I Know\\") rather than pure-pop I think I'd like it a bit better. (7/10) <br /> <br />10. All I've Ever Wanted - Mariah's vocals soar in this beautiful, moving song about unrequited love (again, something I experienced around that time.) Another Mariah/Walter magic moment. (10/10) <br /> <br />11. Everything Fades Away (not credited on album) - I'm not sure if this was a late inclusion or simply a bonus track, but I'm so thankful it was added - and so fitting as the final song! Beautiful music, gorgeous, heart-breaking lyrics, Mariah singing with amazing conviction, and the fabulous backing vocals finish the album off perfectly. (10/10) <br /> <br />A MARIAH FAN MUST-HAVE!!!
B0002DB52M|2.0|Having watched 'Dogville' I was impressed by the methodology used to tell the story. It was ambitious achievement by the director but ultimately I felt the pace of the film to be ponderous and pretentious. What annoyed me most was the narration to the story which grated me. I liked the idea of the story-an almost Kafka like merger of fable and artistic license. But unfortunately relating this to film proved too difficult to achieve and what we end up with is something that fails to deliver. <br />A valiant attempt at creating something different, worth watching for the innovative filming techniques but as a movie it just does not work for me.  <br />As for the criticisms of being anti-american, well the thought never crossed my mind because the setting could be anyway in the world. The story is a fable of human conditions and failings whatever nationality.
B0002DB52M|2.0|Here is the gist of every Trier movie.  Take a woman and make her suffer excrutiatingly for as long as possible.  Any attempt for the victim to showcase their innoncence, even if it matters to say only 3 words, will not happen (this film and Dancer in the Dark). There you have it. <br /> <br />I would describe Trier as a \\"Brilliant\\" sadist.  Nothing more.  Everyone knows he takes his actors and litteraly tortures them.  As a result of Dogville which has great performances and an ingenious execution, but goes on far too long, finishes in a feat of pure nihilism, and ends with a giant what the?? <br /> <br />The guy is a lunatic people.  I dare YOU to watch this movie. <br /> <br />Rating 2.5 stars
B0002KVUKM|3.0|The thing that makes this movie float even a little is Kate. She is easy on the eyes.
B00003CXCT|5.0|The only downside of buying this DVD apart some scenes which would have been nicer if left alone is the money you'd be spending on a THX certified system... overall fabulous collection, its almost like watching a whole new epic.
185984054X|5.0|It is astonishing how many intelligent, skeptical people have fallen for the legend of MT as saint and epitome of selfless devotion to the poor.  Her actions are indeed judged in light of her \\"reputation;\\" not the other way around as for most of us.  Regardless of one's opinion of her life, she was a master of self-promotion to an unparalleled degree.<br /><br />Had the young Agnes Bojaxhiu chosen to make her living in the same manner as John Gotti, it's doubtful that Hitchens would have paid much attention to her.  However, she presented herself as a deeply religious person, the founder and leader of an order of nuns, and as such must be held to a higher standard than we hold criminals and gangsters.  Even an atheist like Hitchens can expect a certain level of decent behavior from religious celebrities like MT.<br /><br />The real tragedy is that MT chose to use her position of power and influence in such a negative way.  The excuse that she was a \\"Catholic Nun\\" and therefore would be expected to hold certain beliefs is disingenuous.  We have the example of Archbishop Romero in El Salvador, and other priests in Central America who espoused \\"liberation theology,\\" and even Pope John Paul II who supported the Solidarity movement and apologized for the Church's past mistreatment of Jews.  Religion at its best has been an ennobling influence on humanity, and at its worst, an excuse for the lying, hypocrisy, fraud, and oppression exemplified by Mother Teresa.
B00005JNEU|4.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" has a number of very powerful scenes both on and off the gridiron. It combines these scenes with a few touching, poignant moments which makes for a very good movie. <br /> <br />High school football has reigned supreme for decades in Odessa,TX. The Permian high school team has had several state champions. Echos of those teams can be seen everywhere: in numerous signs around town, in the stories of the locals, and in the championship rings that some now paunchy middle-aged men flash as they order a beer or drive around town.  <br /> <br />In 1988, Permian fielded a very good team (it's based on a true story) with one outstanding player, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), a flashy running back. The team's coach (Billy Bob Thornton) has designed his offense around Boobie and the city has pinned their hopes (and the survival of Thornton in his job) for a state championship on Boobie. In the first game, Boobie suffers a career ending injury and the rest of the team must now play beyond their potential. The player expected to step up the most is Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), the quarterback. He's a talented player but an unsure individual who feels the pressure placed on him by the town intensely. Meanwhile his fellow teammate Don Billingsley, the son of a local legend Charles Billingsley (Tim McGraw), not only must deal with the pressure placed on him by the town, but also with his abusive, alcholic father who humiliates him at every turn.  <br /> <br />The performances are outstanding. Standouts include Thornton, Black, Luke and McGraw. Luke has a scene where he completely breaks down in a doctor's office when he realizes that his dreams of playing in the pros may have ended and he has little else in his life. McGraw astounded me with his ability to balance scenes of violent rage with ones of more thoughtful introspection.  <br /> <br />The football scenes are graphic and gritty. The viewer feels that he is not only at the game but that he is actually playing in the game!  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this film to lovers of good sports movies--or just good movies in general.
0790729628|5.0|Spot-on about corporations going too far....great sets and<br /><br />music. All great to watch even today and after seeing it over<br /><br />10 times it's still powerful!

0131177052|5.0|Martin Fowler's book on Refactoring showed us how to improve the design of our code. We learned to make changes safely, by taking small, rote steps, and by ensuring that we ran our tests after each small change. But what if we're working on the typical ugly system with no tests? In Working Effectively With Legacy Code, Michael Feathers tackles the problem that most of us end up dealing with.<br /><br />Feathers does an excellent job of articulating the problems and scenarios, using clear examples from C, C++, Java, and C#. Many of the code examples look a lot like real examples I come across all the time--they don't appear to be fabricated.<br /><br />Working Effectively With Legacy Code contains a catalog that provides a wealth of solutions. The catalog shows how to resolve concerns like, \\"I'm changing the same code all over the place\\" and \\"how do I safely change procedural code?\\"<br /><br />The book is highly entertaining and comes across as a conversation with a really sharp, really patient guru developer. Often, it's a chore to slog through code-heavy books. But Feathers manages to keep my attention with interesting stories, loads of examples, and well-written text.<br /><br />I think that Working Effectively With Legacy Code is an important book. The vast majority of existing code presents the classic catch-22: you can't change it safely because it doesn't have tests, and you can't write tests without changing it to easily support testing. It's not an easy problem, and most people will give you high-level ideas for solving it. Feathers is the first person to dig deep and present a wealth of knowledge and insight on the problem, all in one place. I'll be pulling this book from my shelf for years to come.
1591840562|5.0|I have read (and loved) all of Guy's book, and think this is the best one yet. It is extremely focused and practical; it tells you how to do all of the things Guy talks about. It also gives the reader a sense of the reality of the process of bringing a startup to life; Guy doesn't sugarcoat things.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I have such a hard time talking about this whole topic since two members of my family have had to go and fight in Iraq.  My sister's husband was there for a year and my nephew is still there; his wife is due this coming week with #2.  *update* Her baby girl was born on Thursday!    Some people remark that Bush looked like he didn't know how to react to the news in that classroom without someone telling him how to react.  I did not vote for that man, but I think he looked destroyed; as we all were.  I wish he had done something sooner, but I relate to the feeling of helplessness he was going through.  It's unfortunate he wasn't quite strong enough to get up and go, but it was a little understandable.  I'm trying to be nice, here.    The hard core facts presented here are irrefutable.  I can't understand it when those who disagree do so saying \\"he made that up.\\"  How do you make up a private meeting with just Dick and Bush in front of the 9/11 commission which Bush had been against forming in the first place.  Why wasn't Bush able to face the commish on his own?  Strange that.  Also, why all the flights for Saudi family members on 9/11 when nobody else was allowed to fly, including Bush's own daddy?  Strange, that.      There's a whole lot of strange here.  The one emotion every single viewer of this editorial documentary will assuredly come away with is anger.      If you are a conservative, please consider renting this and watching it with some friends.  I know you hate to give money to the guy, I've heard you.  Just, consider a group effort, and try to hear him.      That way you'll be sure to be against him for what you know and not what you've heard.  It will also fire up your validity if you fall that way, for Bush.  I can't understand a vote for Bush, but I realize it's really a vote for Cheney, so OK.    This DVD has more than the movie had.  We particularly enjoyed the comedian skits.  Quite funny stuff.
0671027387|3.0|This is the first Dan Brown novel I have read, and frankly, I was not impressed.  But unlike others, I still enjoyed the book, and the author was good at surprisinging you.  I found the plot to be very intersting, although I couldn't help but think how much better it would have been if it had been written by a better author.  The book really only takes a turn for the worse in the second half.  When the action should be picking up it is playing out.  There are no more great discoveries (you know from reading the title and the back cover that it is already a deception, so it is just stupid to try and use that in the book to surprise the reader).  A lot of the action scenes against the Delta forces are unimaginitive, lack description and are not suspenseful.  In addition, the portrayal of the Delta force didn't feel accurate.  And I seriously doubt they would have killed such a high-profile target, but I am not Delta, so who can say.  But I think that the Delta forces would not have acted as they did in this book, it just felt \\"wrong\\".  The author is barraging you with new technology in a way that is just boring and I was asking myself why he was telling me how the special forces skis were powered, or many other little asides that just broke the flow of the story down.  In addition, the author switches characters/storylines about every 2-10 pages and alwasy ends it without telling you what had just happened, wanting to leave that as a surprise, but when you do that every 10 pages it gets old really fast and just makes the book a chore to read.  I agree with other reviewers, that the book just felt like it was technically inaccurate.  I found most of the characters to be cliched, as was the whole attractive and single male/female setup.  But all of the negative aside, the book is still an interesting read.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I chose not to see this movie in the theater mainly because I did not consider Nicole Kidman to be a very talented actress. She is quite nice to look at, but I do not recall any of her previous films being very good.    Well, I must say, she was actually pretty convincing in her role as the pampered daughter of a minister in the Civil War south. Of course, Jude Law is worthy of his acclaim as an up-and-coming actor, having previously performed quite well in Gattaca. And Renee Zellweiger was totally deserving of her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. All the minor roles were cast and performed delightfully well.    Two things about this movie stand out (and are making me seriously consider purchasing it): the music score and the excellent cinematography. I was amazed to learn much of it was filmed in Romania, which made a very believable North Carolina. The music score is similar to O Brother, Where Art thou, with  Bluegrass, American Spiritual, and a bit of Celtic mixed in. I love the main theme, performed by Alison Krausse and Sting.    Not only is this a high quality film, but it is fun to watch. Law's character has many Odyssey-like adventures as he fights to return to his lost love. A preacher caught up in Sin and a hick Bounty Hunter (cast perfectly as Giovanni Ribisi) provide a nice element of comedy to an otherwise dreary story. But overall, I did not find myself saddened or depressed at the end, but rather satisfied that life went on despite all the tragedy that occurred. After all, Cold Mountain is not just a place, but a state of mind.    Do not let the bad reviews, or Academy Award snubs, fool you. This film is extremely entertaining and will definitely leave a lasting impression. Hopefully you will find it positive like I did.
0061015725|4.0|In the heirarchy of Crichton books, I would place this in the second tier, behind my favourite from this author (Jurassic Park, Great Train Robbery, and Timeline).  Crichton has, for me, always been an uneven writer, with duds like Sphere and the Lost World alternating with the gems. <br /> <br />The story is basically a monster fable, and superficially appears to be like Jurassic Park.  It is not as detailed, there are fewer characters, and the technology is not as believable (or as well explained).  The monster: swarms of nanometre-sized machines that are programmed with a swarm intellegence.  Due to an engineering error in the building in which they are being manufactured, vast quantities of these nanomachines are released into the Nevada desert.  Out there they start to evolve and develop to the point where they are attacking living creatures (including humans) to drag back to their lair as raw materials for producing more machines. <br /> <br />Because they are a swarm of very small particles, they are virtually impossible to destroy - you need a weapon that can fry/irradiate/magnetise all the particles in a particular swarm simultaneously.  This is the connudrum that our hero, Jack, finds himself in.  He's a software programming consultant specialising in modelling pack hunting.  His wife is a top VP at the nanomachine company.  As in all of Crichton's books, most people have their own hidden agendas and secrets that can turn the reader's whole perception of what's happening upside down. <br /> <br />The book is written in the first person, which means we know the main character survives until the end.  However, because he is an outsider brought in to solve a problem he didn't create, he is in the dark as to what's going on.  Not only is this a technological thriller (how do the nanomachines work and can this knowledge help defeat them?) but a psychological one (why does Ricky keep lying to Jack?  Is Jack's wife having an affair?  Have Ricky and/or Julia allied with the nanomachines to advance some hidden agenda?).  This only works because of the 1st-person telling of the story. <br /> <br />At the same time, this is a very fast read, due to Crichton's writing style.  He uses \\"quick cuts\\" (to borrow a film term) to generate a hyperactivity in the action - short sentences, short paragraphs, and each chapter is subdivided into small subsections, usually less that 2 pages long.  And the story is well-crafted, the science believable (mostly), and the characters unsually varied for Crichton. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have commented, the ending leaves a little to be desired.  That some plot points are totally unresolved (and unabashedly so) at the end is fine - if the narrator doesn't know something, there's no reason to think he should become miraculously omniscient at the end.  However, it does feel at times that Crichton laid one too many twists at the end, and one plot point (the question of whether Julia is having an affair) is concluded in such a way that it leaves more questions than answers.  Better for the author to have left it open than to give a seemingly contradictory explanation. <br /> <br />At any rate, of Crichton's books, this rates about a #4 overall (around Airframe on the enjoyment scale).  Not as well-crafted as Jurassic Park, the book it most closely resembles, but a very enjoyable and thrilling read.
B000001E29|5.0|it makes this album amazing and make sense.  The show has only played in the US once (this past fall in San Francisco)-- so it is hard to see, but if you ever get the chance you should.  It is really an amazing collaboration of three brilliant artists.  Like any musical cast recording, the record is hard to understand the full story or make perfect sense of why the songs sound the way they do when you can't see the visual or hear the rest of the text.  Because I did, I love the album.  I can understand why you might not get into it if you haven't seen it, but I think approaching it like you would a sountrack to a musical is helpful.   <br /> <br />And just an FYI -- it's the story of Faust told in a crazy freak show kind of world.  The hunting and the bullets comes in because the devil can give you 12 magic bullets that will always hit their target if you sell your soul.  Plus it ties in in a creepy way to heroine and Burrough's (who wrote the text) shooting his wife.
0780619587|5.0|A film so good that even though the leading man only appears in a half-hour or so of the film, he wins about every award known to film actors.  The rest of the film didn't do so bad either.  There is some hyperbole, the \\"Rach 3\\" isn't unplayable, but everything fits to get the various points across.  I think what impresses me most is the overall quality of the production and acting.  Not a comedy, not a psycho-drama but a rather joyful one hanky view of someone's rather screwed up life.  Lots of good music too.
B00005JMJG|5.0|A company markets itself as helping folks to brighten their lives by completely erasing the memories of people who bring heartache.  Jim Carrey puts on a fantastic performance as a guy who is first erased, then erases back.  I don't think that's giving away too much. <br /> <br />What it reminds you is that technology is not the way to solve your depression or your relationship problems.  It also reminds you that there are probably equal amounts of good memories in your past relationships, even if the bad ones are so bad they hurt.   <br />At times painful, at times a tad bit confusing, and at other times funny, this is a departure for Carrey.   <br />I enjoyed the movie, even finding myself wiping away a little tear. <br /> <br />Now, for the other half of me.  My husband did not like this movie.  Apart from being an extreme stretch of the imagination and too much of a notion to accept (regarding the memory erase:  why not just erase the one bad memory?  why the whole peson?  An end to all the problems of the movie.....), he also thought there were some serious flaws in the continuity of the film.  For instance, we are led to believe that the characters have known each other for like hours or maybe a couple of days when he goes in to do the erase.  Not saying too much, but the time frame is a little wrong.  Watch out for the two versions of the picnic at the beach. <br /> <br />Anyways, though, this is my review and I really liked it.  I love how it ended, though perhaps it fell on the slightly hokier side.
B000683VI4|5.0|I can't say it enough how much this film means to me. It was one of the most touching stories I have EVER heard. I read the book which was wonderful, but seeing it on screen helped bring out the true emotion brought forth in the story.  <br />  I loved the way the actors were portrayed. It was not a typical love story where everything is happy and everything works out. The characters, Allie and Noah, have a unique chemistry that is believable. They have REAL moments where they fight, break up, fall in love, and also those moments where they look into each others eyes and know that everything will be ok.  <br />  I loved the scenery, the cinemetography, the story line, and most of all, the characters. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are truely a once in a lifetime couple that will lift your spirits, and once again make you remember your first love. <br /> I can't wait to own this movie on DVD. It will definitely be a prized possession. Too bad it's not going to be released before the Christmas holidays. What's up with that!?
B0002S65W2|2.0|Okay, this movie had all the ingredients to be a really good thriller but maqn did they screw it up.  First off, Halle Berry's acting was horrendous.  Everyone else (Robert Downey Jr., Penelope Cruz and Charles S. Dutton were believable.  For some reason I had the feeling that Halle Berry felt that she was too good for horror.  That she was beyond this.  When you can't feel for the main character you already have a movie in trouble.  Then when you take the plotline from Stir of Echoes and twist it around a little bit you come up with this terrible movie called Gothika.  If you want to see a good movie with a similar plot watch Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon.  You'll be happy that you didn't waste your money and time on Gothika.
B00005JMAH|5.0|WOW! Harry potter's third try at being a movie- and this time they succeded! Everyone does GREAT in this film, especially the three leading actors who have previously struggled with becoming their characters believably. Alfonso did a really well job directing it, taking to places that Chris Columbus didn't seem to want to take the first two. It's alot better filmed, with alot better effects, and altogether it's alot more enjoyable to watch (despite it's length). Of course in movies one can't include everything, so there are somethings that are sadly left out, but everything that you need to know is there, so that's better than having all the fun moments and none of the pot. Oh my, I meant \\"plot\\".   This film is great for all ages, though the younger ones might be a bit scaresome moments. Luckily in todays's society most children are desensitized to things like scary creatures and should be just fine. This one will be enjoyable for ages!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Well, for a start, forget about Bram Stoker. In `Dracula' of course, van Helsing is a scholar, fighting the forces of darkness with his intellect not his muscles. Here suddenly he is a hulking action hero. He isn't even allowed to be a scholarly type with muscles. Rather he's just a grunt, relying entirely on his sidekick Carl whenever there are any books or stuff that need reading. Now it's not really  any kind of virtue in a movie to be too deferential to literary source material. But all this is about as ridiculous as casting Arnold Schwarzenegger  in a loin cloth to play the lead in a movie and then calling it `The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'.  <br /> <br />WE could still forgive this readily enough if the van Helsing on offer was an interesting or engaging hulking action hero. He is not. As played by Hugh Jackman he is almost entirely lacklustre, wooden and uninteresting. No flair, no imagination, no wit, no style. Much the same goes for Kate Beckinsale as the one-dimensional heroine (tediously stereotypical exotic princess type). And, well, I thought Gary Oldman was safe in his tenure of the award for all-time least scary Count Dracula in movie history but just watch Richard Roxburgh snatch it away from him here. But if Dracula is feeble, his brides are just laughable. (It's hard to say if they are feebler in their human version or when they take flight and become entirely computer generated. I'd go for the latter: here they are naked but in a peculiarly daft fit of prudishness they have been permitted neither nipples nor genitals.) If David Wenham as Carl stands out among the cast it's not because he's particularly good but just because he's not positively awful like everyone else.  <br /> <br />The film is directed by Stephen Sommers who gave us the two `Mummy' movies. These were both utter silly nonsense but, in their undemanding way, immensely entertaining. This movie has the same vice but fails to share the redeeming virtue. Perhaps the reason is partly because in `The Mummy' we had Fraser, Weisz and Hannah as something roughly recognizable as an approximation to ordinary human beings, finding themselves confused and at a loss in the face of an unfamiliar supernatural terror. Whereas here we just have superhuman comic book heroes it is very hard to identify with or much care about taking the whole thing very much in their stride. But then that's true of the `Blade' movies which are a lot better than this. A better diagnosis is that this is just a totally crap movie, one in which writing talent, imagination, decent acting and more or less everything else a  movie needs are lazily neglected in a woeful over-reliance on tediously overdone CGI fireworks. Some horror movies,, notoriously, succeed in being crap in a rather fun, campy sort of way. This one, I fear is just a painfully slow way of waiting for two hours to go past. <br />
B00000I1OY|5.0|\\"The Swimmer\\" is Sidney Pollack's brilliant adaptation of John Cheever's great short story of the same name. Neddy Merrill, perfectly portrayed by past-his-prime Burt Lancaster, is ostensibly a successful businessman and family man. But, as the film progresses, something darker begins to be hinted at, and then begins to emerge. Not all is as it seems in this surreal story. As Neddy makes his way across his suburban world--via his neighbors' swimming pools--the drinking and partying become less pleasant, to say the least. When he (and the viewer) reach the harrowing ending, we realize that the fears and dreads that plague Neddy stem from his denial of his reality. <br /> <br />Underneath the plot of \\"The Swimmer\\" is an allegory about alcoholism. The drinking that goes on in every scene is the comfort that Neddy seeks to conceal his failures and avoid his responsibilities. By the end, we can safely assume that Neddy's alcoholism destroyed his finances and his family, and he just cannot face up to it. Burt Lancaster's performance ranges from the happy-go-lucky, to the completely mystified, to abject fear and pathos. Pollack's understated touch only intensifies Lancaster's performance. This is as important a movie to watch, as the story is to read.
0671027387|5.0|This book is a personal favorite because it hits on a beloved topic: the search for life on other planets.  I'm not saying I believe in intelligent life, but moving on: This book deals with an unbelievable discovery.  This amazing meteorite with life in it is discovered.  Almost immediately, it is surrounded in secrecy so it can be adequately identified as such a profound scientific find.  If you know Dan Brown's books, you know that before anyone gets a nap something has come up.  In fact, during the next twenty-four hours or so, a whole lot of evidence points to something wrong with the meteorite, but I can't tell you that.<br /><br />It's a fun romp, more on the scientific side than Angels or Code, but that's what I dig, anyways.  I learned a bunch, as you always will reading Brown.<br /><br />An enjoyable, suspenseful, page-turner-and-a-half, I think you'll have a heck of a time reading this one.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|First of all I really enjoyed Underworld, and I think that the plot is a good.  There's enough action to keep everyone interested but the movie involves more than just gruesome violence.  There are twists in the plot and an interesting story line.  Also, the performances by the actors/actresses are good.  Another thing I enjoy about Underworld is that it's not disturbing or scary.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes the Blade movies, the Crow and Frailty.
B00003CXCT|4.0|This review supposes that you've watched all three movies -- in their various incarnations -- at least a dozen times. If not, what are you waiting for? And only the sheer love I have for these films precludes me from rating the whole shebang less than four stars. Otherwise, this is a three-star product... <br /> <br />First of all the presentation and packaging was noticably sub-standard for such a hugely anticipated, landmark DVD launch: cheapily thin cardboard volume box with the DVDs shoved in. No booklets, no tchotchkes, no nothing. Some people may not care about such things, but it immediately signalled to me that Lucas really didn't give a hoot about how it looked -- people were going to buy it anyway. For such a lanmark piece of cinema, it compares poorly on packaging with the awesome care put into the &#34;Band of Brothers&#34; boxed set, or even the LOTR films. <br /> <br />While I'm not a sound or video expert who can pinpoint minute errors, there are noticible color correction problems in Episode IV, which may be a holdover from the quality of the print. But I'm sorry, in this digital age, someone at Lucasfilms should have picked up on it. It's most annoyingly apparent in the opening Tatooine scenes. There were also some DVD static too which to me signals a poor transfer. It's a sad fact that for 'A New Hope' my VHS copy has better picture quality in some scenes... <br /> <br />The best is the Death Star battle -- the cgi remake is IMO superior to the original. <br /> <br />Episode V was a vast improvement in transfer with no noticable color issues, f/x artifacts, etc. Same with Episode VI. Music in both is given a stronger boost (in a good way) that really lets you hear it tell the story along with the visuals. Whether this was an error, or not, it sounds magnificent. <br /> <br />The special seatures, including the much-hyped two hour documentary, aren't all that, to tell the truth. There's little offered in these extras that most Star Wars fans don't already know, nor is anything beyond the usual full-length feature, some featurettes, trailers and production stills. I did get a kick out of the old trailers for their amusing cheesiness. However the quality of the extras is such that once you've watched the extras, they're not worth a second viewings. <br /> <br />The commentary tracks are so-so as well. Lucas does provide some interesting bits about his inspirations and about the evolution of the story. By far the most fascinating commentary comes, once again, from sound designer Ben Burtt. Carrie Fisher contributes really nothing aside from typically cynical showbiz comments. Harrison Ford is a grouch anyway, so he's not missed, but where was Hamill? His interviews on the extras were quite good. Or Anthony Daniels? I'd would've loved to hear John Williams discuss his musicial score and cues. As far as commentary goes, it really should have had something along the level of what was on the LOTR extended DVDs where there were multiple tracks for the filmmakers, the cast, and production/design teams. <br /> <br />All told, if this is the best Lucas could do, it falls short; I think it will be disappointing on several levels for many die-hard Star Wars fans because it feels like a half-baked effort to present a legendary work of film. At least I wasn't getting gouged on the price. <br /> <br />Like many fans, I regret not having theatrical versions of the Trilogy included. If so, I would have gladly paid over $100 for some sort of &#34;Ultimate Star Wars Edition.&#34; &#60;hint, hint...&#62;
B000002H70|5.0|There are a few records that you wish you could hear again for the first time, to remember that feeling of pure ecstasy you feel when you hear a record that pretty much changes the way you look at things. And for me, \\"Disitigration\\" is one of those records. <br />\\"Disinitgration\\" was the third Cure record that I heard, friends having played me the horrid \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" and the uninspired \\"Blooflowers\\", so I wasn't a fan of the Cure. But a friend of mine insisted that I burn this record and give it a listen, so to make him shut up and leave me alone, I did, but waited nearly two months to listen to it. And when I did, my jaw feel on the ground and stay fixed there until the end. It took me two and a half hours to listen to this record, because I couldn't believe what I had just heard and I had to hear it again. And since that day, almost two years ago, this record is rarely away from disc changer. <br />What you can expect from \\"Disintigration\\" is pop music played on a truly epic scale. Most of the songs go over four minutes but its too the Cure's credit that nothing on this record that should've been changed even by a single note. \\"Pictures of You\\" is the perfect example of how this record works: If you've heard the single version of it, that runs four minutes rather than seven, the song is nice, but not great. But the real version on this record builds to a point over two minutes of euphoria, so once it actually starts with Robert Smith's impecable singing, your all ready hooked. <br />The songs are gothic psychedelic, cold and dark, but not as much so as \\"Pornography\\" or \\"Faith\\". \\"Disintigration\\" invites you into its sadness to make you feel better about it all. This record is like a friend with good advice on a bad day: everything might be bad now, but it has to get better than this. <br />There aren't enough words to say how strongly I feel about this record. To me, the songwrittng, the lyrical content, the production, to packaging, the whole thing is flawless. <br />Even if I can't hear it again for the first time again, everytime I hear \\"Disintigration\\" it reminds me of why I love music: it can give you hope.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Maybe this quote will help all you critics of free speech and alleged anti-Americanism: <br />\\"Patriotism is supporting your country all the time and the government when it deserves it.\\" -Mark Twain, author and humorist (1835-1910) <br /> <br />Of course, Twain was probably a leftist radical, too - what with his attitudes about black people having rights and all.  What was he smoking? <br /> <br />And Ray - it's really schoolyard bully behavior to attack someone's personal appearance. Nice touch when you run out of salient arguments. Like Rush Limbaugh isn't fat? oh, please.  <br /> <br />\\"Zaza\\" is the name of my dog. I didnt' think she had actually seen the movie, now I find out she can post messages on the Internet. Wow.  <br />
B000286RNY|5.0|\\"Shaolin Soccer\\" is high on the list of my favorite Chinese-language movies.  I had no idea that it would be so good when I bought it.  It had been a while since I had seen a movie that I found so original--certain scenes blew me away to say the least.  I took very little of the movie seriously as the title and the first scenes indicated that this movie is supposed to be viewed as a light-hearted farce.  This movie will take you for a ride if you let it.  Though some people, understandably, simply won't \\"get\\" it, the humor is fairly universal--largely physical comedy and slap-stick gags. \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" was the first Stephen Chow movie that I watched and it made me seek out more of his films.    If you like this movie, and if you do not mind subtitles, try to get your hands on a copy of Stephen Chow's equally irreverant \\"God of Cookery\\".
068987474X|5.0|Excellent book! I wished I had read this book a year ago when I dated a frog!<br />It's so simple yet Greg is right, we make it complex.
B0006213WG|4.0|If you are a fan of Sum 41, then their newest album shouldn't disappoint.  This album is pretty similar to their last album \\"Does this look infected\\" (DTLI) as it has some heavy guitar riffs and fast-paced punk-sometimes bordering on metal.  There is also some rapping in the verses of some of the songs like in DTLI.  However, this album has some slower, more mellow songs unlike DTLI.  So, if you liked Sum's first two poppier albums but didn't care for DTLI then I wouldn't recommend this album, but to all those who enjoy Sum's last album, I think you'll enjoy this one also.  Chuck is a solid 38 minute long album with heavy guitars and catchy hooks.  As far as content goes, the lyrics seem to be a little more serious than on prior albums and seem to be more influenced by current world occurences.  But it all comes down to the fact that Sum 41 has done what they do best and put out a quality punk album.
B00005JL78|5.0|This movie is very captivating. I gotta admit, i saw the 2 1/2 hour runtime and was thinking how boring at least an hour of it will be, but I was wrong, action all around. Yeah the beginning is boring (first 5 minutes i'd say) but just like every movie, we have to get introduced to the story. (yeah i love getting right into the action). All the other reviewers already told you the story so i won't dwell on that, rather on the great reviews it has received. Trust me, don't be fooled by the runtime or the \\"its a sci fi boring movie\\" cause this is a great movie. Definately get this movie as it is a keeper.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I won't bother writing another review, everyone has an opinion.  Some people liked the Matrix series, others hated it.  I think most people reading this have already seen the movie and are just looking for a review of the DVD's and the boxed set.  I couldn't tell you since it's not out yet, but I plan making this purchase the day it's released. <br /> <br />I do have something I would like to share with fans though.  I watched THE CROW yesterday and While I enjoyed the Matrix movies and I think Keanu Reeves does a good job as Neo, I could not help thinking what if Brandon Lee was still alive?   <br /> <br />Is it just me or does it seem like Brandon Lee would have been Ideal for this role.  I can't help but wonder how a change of actors might have effected the overall outcome of the film. Again I don't wan't to take anything away from Keanu, his performance was excellent with regards to this particular role, but what if? <br /> <br />I find myself entertaining such fantasies often, I must have too much time on my hands but I was curious to know what others think.  Feel free to write me with your opinions at memphisprime@yahoo.com <br /> <br />\\"And suddenly I heard a rapping, a rapping at my chamber door.\\"
B00005JMXX|5.0|This movie begins where it ends. It is a poem in a form understood by so many, yet so few choose to listen. This is the foundation for which, I have seen, this movie, form and build into an epic scale of colossal music. I can understand why people would not like this. A compassionate premise for a movie is not an entirely good movie you would want to make. Yet I believe this is a classic, timeless, in its beginning, and ending, and beyond even truth. <br /> <br />The constant merging of reality and unreality is called Imagination, which is the only purpose of visual effects, and this, the director and actors have proven true. <br /> <br />That is why it is beyond truth, in my opinion. Yet the utter lack of clarity as to what global warming is can be yelled at for years; even hundreds of years, as scientists predict chaos from global warming may ensue; yet the constant struggle between trying to define truth and what is clear about global warming is something that no film can declare absolutely. Having said this, I believe the only purpose of the film is to be epic, compassionate, wonderful. <br /> <br />It is a mystery to me why people overlook this. Perhaps it's the reason why we fail to notice, for instance, the floods are unnatural in our times; too many floods happen and have occurred too recently and too close for us to justify as natural; real people have died in these floods. <br /> <br />Another thing: Hurricanes increase in frequency when we use fossil fuels. They have now for the past thirty years, since the rapid expansion of fossil fuel usage around the world. I think of the people who have died in hurricanes, lost their homes, memories, had their basements and upper levels even, flooded. I think of those I read in the newspaper, and think, we don't need a full catastrophe like an Ice Age to prove that global warming should be acted on now. And if the science isn't exact, why should we avoid the truth that the absolutes determine our fate? If we use thesis and antithesis as reminders of our value; so does the time of change, which is our will, need to understand these two concepts must be battled out within the emotional sphere. <br /> <br />A movie's only purpose is to be emotional. The people watching this hate the nonscience, the unrational, almost boring nature of seeing no facts with which to debate over. I like the candid use, however, of laughter, as it heightens the evil within the film without making you think of science. <br /> <br />You would find these people identically wandering over their pleasure centres with no regard for time, as you would find them criticizing the movie's premise. It is sad to think that less people will watch this film because of a few candid remarks. I hold no belief against those who choose not to however; but I urge those who are struggling to understand that it is not science that compels this future, but human beings, and to do otherwise is to place machines ahead of humanity.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about buying this album.  There was just something about Celine having to team up with another person/group to do an album.  However, I decided to give it a chance.  At least she was teaming up with famous photographer, Anne Geddes, instead of a multi-million dollar corporation like Chrysler.  While ONE HEART is a mixed bag of faster-paced songs and ballads, this new CD is chock full of slower odes to motherhood, and not surprisingly, Celine does a MUCH better job in execution.  Her voice is in fine form here...not too strong and overpowering...and not to whiny either.  What we get here is a harkening back to the days before her 2 year hiatus...back to the days of LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE.  The result is a nice album full of Celine's signature ballads that deserves to be in any fan's collection.
068987474X|5.0|This book is da bomb. I read it in 2 days because it was so engaging and interesting.  Greg and Liz's points of view were delivered in a clear and concise manner.  This book is a wake up call for any woman who keeps having to make excuses for the behaviour of the men in her life (i.e. the ones she's romantically involved with). The book teaches but not in a preachy manner - It's hilarious the way things are expressed and made me agree with just about everything in there.  It is worth the money and I enjoyed it and will read it again to keep the lessons learned fresh in my head.  The bottom line of the book is not to accept BS from men.  I agree!!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance has quickly become my favorite band, or at least in the top 3, and from first listen I was hooked. I don remember why or where I heard them but I am glad I did. Three Cheers is every bit as good or maybe a little better than their debut, I Gave You Bullets, and mostly every song on here is catchy. There is a great combination of heavy screaming songs and a little bit softer side on Ghost of You. Also check out a cool video for Im not okay and that is a good judging point on whether you will enjoy this band or not. I suggest this for fans of good rock/emo music that are tired of being limited to what you hear on the radio. Most of the good stuff doesnt get a whole lot of air time on the radio and My Chemical Romance falls into that category (though Im Not Okay may change that). So the best songs on here I would say are Helena, Im Not Okay, Ghost of You, Thank You For The Venom,To the End and Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You. And Its not a fashion statement. Hell they are all great so check it out for yourself. And while you are at it check out their debut cd for the 2 best MCR songs in my opinion, Honey this mirror isnt big enough for the two of us and our lady of sorrows.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Over the years, Mark Knopfler has carved out a niche as a master guitarist, from his lead in \\"Dire Straits\\", to his artistry as sound track composer, and solo albums such as \\"Golden Heart\\", \\"Sailing To Philadelphia\\", and \\"Ragpicker's Dream\\". Although Knopfler's guitar has a more subdued presence on \\"Shangri-La\\" in comparison to other works, his choice of subject matter, and lyrics, are still first-rate. We know him as a guitar genius, but this guy has a way with words, as well. He's a story-teller, who puts himself in the other guy's shoes, and spins dark, seedy, and sometimes humorous tales. His knowledge of history is evidenced in his \\"Song For Sonny Liston\\", and \\"5:15 a.m.\\" If it's Knopfler's smooth, slick guitar you're after, then \\"Boom, Like That\\" will not only remind you that this guy has greased fingers, but his musical compositions are, well... \\"catchy\\", for lack of a better word. <br />   This song collection is a bit more polished than some of his other works, which is not a bad thing, and, granted, most of this material is not dance music. And it lacks the long, soaring endings that Knopfler has been known for in the past, when he finishes a number with a three-minute solo. You won't find that here. When he does sing a love song, as in \\"All That Matters\\", the music suddenly becomes dull and lifeless. Let's face it: Standard love songs have never been Knopfler's forte. Still, Knopfler's style is as recognizable, and enjoyable as ever. It may not have the power of the album \\"Golden Heart\\", but I found myself cranking up \\"Boom, Like That\\", (which is a first-person look at the success of Ray Kroc, and his McDonald's franchise)and rattling the windows. Time will be the judge, but this single may be his best work yet. <br />   No doubt... Knopfler still has all his fingers, and this album will stand with any of his past works.
B00005JMXX|4.0|If you were expecting this movie to be a repeat of Independence Day, you are sorely mistaken!  This movie was really entertaining!  Even though the plot could have been better, the awesome special effects make the two hours simply fly by!  I found myself just sitting in the chair staring at the TV.  I have to admit, the director did push the envelope a little bit with the global warming/instant horrible weather slant, but I think that what he was after is to illustrate the point that everything we do effects us in some way.  Everything has a cause and effect.  I am not an environmentalist by far, but you have to appreciate Emmerich's approach in what he is trying to say in the film.  Bill Paxton gives a great performance too.  All in all, this is a mighty good flick!  Anytime you have massive tornadoes in L.A. and the Statue of Liberty flooded and then frozen, it has to be good!!! <br /> <br />The only problem I had was that there weren't enough special features, hence, the four stars.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this one!
B00005JMX6|5.0|This is a very sexy and steamy movie,  <br />perfect for a hot date that you want <br />to get even hotter.  Especially if you <br />are inteding to use the techniques in <br />the DVD \\"NEW SEX NOW\\" to your <br />advantage.  Buy it.
B000007T1M|5.0|System of a Down, whether you agree with their message or not, are a talented band that gets better and better with each album. But it started with this one in 1998. I first heard of them through the video for Sugar, which was great because it was definately different than everything else at the time. They combine meaningful lyrics about real issues with other lyrics that seem funny. The vocals here are really good going from singing to screaming even to a high pitched scream. Now I know that not everybody likes them because their stances on some of the problems in our world today disagree with some. But you have to hand it to them, they are musicians with a purpose. This first album is mostly heavy all the way through and when is that ever a bad thing? Sugar is a classic as is Spiders, but songs like Know, War?, and Suite pee should not be overlooked either. SOAD is an amazing band and I am looking forward to the new album which may come out this year. Although I dont agree with necessarily everything they say on here, I respect other beliefs and I like what they are doing right now for rock music. And for KarlMarx below, SOAD is not all about the money and if you really listened to this you would know that. And SOAD kills Rage Against the Machine any day(even though I listen to them also.) Chances are if you have SOAD before you know it is good stuff, but check out the debut if you have not already.
B00005LB50|3.0|That's the only explanation I can think of that's plausible.  I have no idea if any of the former band members were involved in this release -- I can only hope they would have more integrity than to be a part of this.<br /><br />First of all, I'll state that Buffalo Springfield was one of my very favorite bands from the 60s -- in a time of rich musical expansion and experimentation, they showcased some of the most imaginative, poetic AND melodic songwriting around.  They combined intelligence with well-written pop tunes, incorporating influences from folk, country, blues and just plain rock-n-roll into their music.  I gave this 3 stars for the sheer integrity and lasting qualities that make their music so special -- if some thought had gone into the compiling and packaging of this set, it could have easily rated more than the 5 start limit.<br /><br />When I saw the release of this set some time ago, I mentally put it on my 'to buy' list -- I was certain that it would be an indespensable part of my collection.  I couldn't have been more mistaken.<br /><br />Some of the reviews below have cited some of the same factors that disappointed me so much -- mainly, why in the world would over half of their final studio album be left out?  Why would the 4th disc in the set be made up of tracks that had already been included on discs 1 - 3?  The tracks from the first album that are repeated are labeled 'mono version' -- but even on headphones, I can't tell any difference between them and the tracks that are unlabeled (which I would assume are supposed to be stereo).  There are quite a few demo tracks included here (most of which are of dubious quality at best) -- but no live tracks.  The live shows this band did were legendary -- surely somewhere there exist re-workable tapes of some of these performances...?  Even without any live tracks, the set should have at least included all the tracks from their three studio albums -- the fourth disc could have been made up of the demo tracks, if the producers felt the need to include them.<br /><br />For the price the releasing company (it's credited to Rhino/Elektra) is asking for this, even a readable booklet filled with good information would have made it a bit more palpable -- but at $60, you'd be better off buying the individual single-album CDs.  You can get them right here, from Amazon, for $9.98 each, plus shipping -- and you'd wind up with all the studio tracks for half the price of this set, with none of the excess baggage.

0920668372|5.0|It's interesting, I have been reading through all of these reviews and to be honest I was pretty much shocked by the comments made against the book. <br /> <br />I am a teenager and I was writing a report on a childhood book that influenced my life. \\"Love you Forever\\" has influenced not only my childhood, but also my teenage years. When I see an adult read it, a tear always forms right in the corner of their eyes. The book changed the way I saw life.  <br /> <br />This book was about understanding the way we grow older and helps children understand that their parents will grow older too.  <br />Some of these reviews look at the book from too much of a stiff adult prespective. It is sick and perverted to insinuate that the message in the book is about a creepy mothers sexual behaviour. The book shows the loving relationship between mother and child. <br /> <br />I read this book to my nephews and I wil read it to my children.  <br />It is perhaps one of the best childrens books ever written becuase you will remember it for the rest of your life. <br /> <br />Enjoy it.
0156027321|4.0|I would most certainly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys journey tales and likes to dabble in philosophy and theology.  The Life of Pi is a convincing and wonderfully written tale that follows the main character (Pi) accross the Pacific in search of land and himself.  But just be careful not to go too deep with him or you mind find yourself at the bottom of the ocean with no life preserver!  But do judge for yourself.  I have recommended this book to a few people and they have enjoyed it very much, and we have had lengthy conversations about it. So go ahead, read it.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|For years i thought Slipknot was garbage that was untill Vol 3. the first time i heard Duality i was shocked that it came from Slipknot i think that Duality is the best song they have right now anyways i listened to the whole cd and i found some good tunes and some vintage slipknot which isnt a good thing but if your into that kind of stuff then i guess its alright n e ways peace
0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones was a great novel. I enjoyed it so much because of it's mysterious and random ways of writing, or narrating. The narrator is the Susie, a girl who was raped and murdered. She talks about how life on earth goes on without her, and she just says it so beautifuly and peacefully, even though the worst things are happening. The story was strong, and so interesting, I couldn't stop reading it, because of it's mystery, you wanting to know what happens to the characters you now love, or the murderer himself. Susie talks very descriptively about the rape at the first chapter, I shuddered at what little I read, and skipped ahead, it was just to horrible, and spine chilling. I really recommend this book to anyone who wants to be glued to the pages, and find a beautiful story written by a great author.
B0006213WG|5.0|This is another solid CD from Sum 41. Its softer than their last CD, but harder than All Killer, No Filler. The best songs are No Reason and Pieces. Other good songs are Some Say and Open Your Eyes. Its an awesome CD and I highly recommend buying it.
B000002IGV|5.0|This is such a fun album. I just broke it out again today after not listening to \\"Stay Hungry\\" for a few years. This is just a really solid rock album, and every track sizzles with early 80's metal angst. I remember being a Pre-Teen when this came out and watching the video for \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and being blown away. I ran right out and picked up the cassette of this album. I have to say that this album really set the trend for hair metal bands of the 80's who would produce maybe one really good album and then disappear; Slaughter, Firehouse, Winger etc. But Twister Sister led the way, and with songs like \\"I Wanna Rock\\", \\"Burn in Hell\\" and \\"Horror-Teria\\" they really tapped into a \\"new\\" sound that quite a few of me and my friends at the time were looking for, and couldn't get enough of. If you enjoy 80's metal, then you have to have a copy of this disk. It's a shame that the band became too cartoony, and losing all of their anger, to be taken seriously with the follow up album \\"Come Out and Play\\" because it's obvious there is talent here, just not enough to overcome \\"Leader of the Pack\\".
0441172717|5.0|I read DUNE a few years ago and I really enjoyed it.  It was written in a style hadn't read before and it was the first Sci-Fi/Fantasy book I had read that really engaged me in any way.  After I had finished reading it I moved on to a different book and discovered that DUNE had spoiled me.  It spoiled me in that it became my benchmark that I've been comparing all other stories to since then and, while I might not be the most completely well-read person in the world, I can honestly say I haven't come across another story (book, movie, or otherwise) that has equalled DUNE.  LOL, when I began reading DUNE (I had just graduated High School) I was a Star Wars geek and now I'm a DUNE geek!
B00005JNEI|5.0|President Bush is the wrong man in the White House! Michael Moore's film was extraordinary and it shows that President Bush lied to the American people. Why would he go to Iraq and capture Sadaam and he wasn't even the one who committed the 9/11 attacks, it was Al Queda in Afghanistan. Afghanistan/Iraq have no connections and he swore that Sadaam had weapons of mass destruction! And troops were sent over there to die for nothing and it was sad to see the Limpscomb family hurt about there child's death. They haven't found any weapons of mass destruction and troops and civilians are dying for nothing! People are getting beheaded and so forth. There was an interesting scene in the film where Moore and the marine tried to hand out flyers for the military to the Congressman to see if they would send there children in harms way! You should have saw the look on the Congressmans face. That whole administration is corrupt and Moore did a very good job of letting out the truth! And why didn't they have cameras in the room when the 9/11 COMMISION INTERVIEWED PRESIDENT BUSH AND DICK CHEANEY?? There is a special feature with Condellezza Rice answering questions from the 9/11 Commission and she said, \\"BUSH WAS AWARE OF THE SECURITY REPORT FROM THE FBI BEFORE SEPTEMBER 11.\\" But Bush was too focused on playing golf at his ranch in Texas! 9/11 could have been prevented and Moore gets a standing ovation from me on this film because it is the truth! What is America coming to if Bush is elected again? By me reading some of these reviews, people are just blinded that Bush is a liar and that he is corrupt just like his dad! Great film and I wish Micahel Moore the best! <br /> <br />
0441172717|5.0|This book and the first three Foundations are the zenith of science fiction. But Dune is more. I've never read a book that delves so deeply into the psychological and inner thoughts of the main characters. Simply put, this book creates a new universe, a new metaphysical reality that no other book can touch. I recommend that you read this book; not once, but over and over again. The whole series allows you to feel the immensity of both the universe and the human mind. Please read this book.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 is a documentary not about 9/11/2001, but about what Moore sees as a large scale corruption and incompetence on the part of the current federal administration. Moore unapologetically criticizes and questions the dubious outcome of the 2000 Presidential election, Bush and Cheney's ties to Saudi Oil Money, The real purpose of the War in Iraq and the large scale War Machine that stands to profit from 9/11 and the Iraq War. <br /> <br />Michael Moore asks the questions that are on most people's minds (or would be if we scoured the news as painstakingly as Moore has) and shows us answers we may or may not like. Why did the U.S government allow the bin laden family to leave the country after 9/11 when all other planes were grounded? Did Bush ignore warnings that Al Qaeda was planning an attack? How much does Saudi money effect the United States economy?  <br /> <br />Moore pulls no punches, but if you think the democratic party comes out looking any rosier than the republicans, you need to think again. Moore is critical of our entire government as a whole and wants to know (as we all do) where the government went wrong and what they will do to protect us. <br /> <br />Moore's documentary may shock you, and it will definitely open your eyes and get you thinking about the facts he presents, whether you agree with him or not.  <br /> <br />Love Moore or Hate him, his factchecking is nearly flawless (his website gives every citation you need) and his movie is uproariously funny. Moore simultaneously scares me about our nation's future enough to incite me to action (this IS an election year), and makes me laugh harder than I have at any comedy. <br /> <br />The movie shows us everyone from soldiers in Iraq on Christmas Eve, to Taliban leaders, of course to our president himself. <br /> <br />The special features have added scenes and extended interviews, including Condolezza Rice's testimony before the 9/11 comission. Moore doens't twist your arm, but he does present a convincing argument for why he feels the way he does. This movie is a must see for anyone interested in politics, anyone who cares about this nation, or anyone who wants to give an EDUCATED opinion about the movie, or just wants to know what the fuss is all about.

Instead, I fell asleep going through the first few chapters. Poor arguments which sometimes shoots itself in the toes. Here is one disarrayed writer instead of a lawyer proving his case. Sheesh... if I could return this book.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Cherub Rock- Amazing, lets you know what this band is about, power 5/5 <br /> <br />Quiet- a little heavy, but the band pulls it off so it doesn't sound too neavy-metalish 5/5 <br /> <br />Today- Classic, i can't describe how great this song is, just see for yourself 5/5 <br /> <br />Hummer- this is 90's alternative at it's finest, A hard distorted guitar with a classic jam 5/5 <br /> <br />Rocket- A truly innovative song on an innovative album, shows the bands creative side while sticking to the scheme of the album 5/5 <br /> <br />Disarm- Everything about this song is perfect, the guitar, choise of instruments, lyrics 5/5 <br /> <br />Soma- pretty good, but kind of goes downhill once it turns hard 4/5 <br /> <br />Geek U.S.A.- Now this is what rock is about, energy, I'm surprised this wasn't put out as a single 5/5 <br /> <br />Mayonnaise- good, but a bit Cheesy 4/5 <br /> <br />Spaceboy- Sensetive, but not boring, it's soft but it keeps your interest 5/5 <br /> <br />Silverf___- Masterpiece, combines everything good that other bands have done into one 9 minute experience <br /> <br />Sweet Sweet- Fun but kind of a filler 4/5 <br /> <br />Luna- A soft masterpiece, great use of mellotron 5/5

B00004WEJZ|3.0|I think this is one of the most erotic movies ever made. Not just the stars but the film in general has a vibrant, erotic quality and lots of sexy women flirting to the camera in the background. <br /> <br />Very obvious chemistry the overpoweringly sexual Barbara Carrera - as sexy a woman imaginable - and Connery during their initial heavy flirting and the resultant love scene is one of the most erotic I've seen in any film. <br /> <br />How did this get a PG? Is there any hot footage still available that was left on the cutting-roonm floor?
B000055XMF|5.0|Quadrophenia is an overlooked coming of age movie. It is the type of movie that is usually always available at you local video store, because most people don't know about it. This film was made by the Rock Group THE WHO!! Completely different format than THE WHO's Tommy. Quadrophenia is also historically acurate, in that it takes place in Great Britian during the Mod and Rocker gang riots. Quadrophenia is about a mod teenager named Jimmy who is questioning authority and life in general. He is taking drugs, kicked out of his house by his parents and is contimplating sucide. This film is very relivent even today to most teenagers.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Everyone involved in this movie was absolutely perfect.  The film itself is a dark war comedy.  There's not much to say about it that hasn't already been said.  It's amazing.  Definitely recommended to anyone who likes Kubrick.  Recommended to anyone at all.  Great film. <br />This DVD is great also.  The best version you'll find for a while.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|The best concert DVD I've seen. <br /> <br />These guys are simply amazing on all fronts. <br /> <br />Buy this DVD.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I liked the stuff I heard over the years, but never picked up a proper album.  Figured I'd just listen to the Buzzcocks.  I did eventually get that greatest hits CD.  Listening to that made me realize what a consistent and catchy band Green Day has been for over a decade.  I heard good things about this album, so I picked it up.<br /><br />Stunning.  From start to finish this album is a keeper.  The two \\"rock-opera\\" medleys, ballads, etc.  All grounded in the pop-punk Green Day is known for.  Insightful (and topical!) lyrics, strong melodies, catchy riffs.  Not really a bad tune on the album.  And it all ties together beautifully.  This quickly made my short list for Top 5 albums I've heard so far this year.  And I am more of an indie-rock guy.  Highly recommended.
B00005B6N7|1.0|This film should be the last war film you ever watch. What a waste of time! If I had paid to see this I would have demanded my money back! Many other reviewers have picked holes in the film itself and the many technical mistakes so it is pointless repeating it here.  <br /> <br />The real story of \\"U-571\\" is far more exciting and captivating than the fiction within this film. At least the film refers to the real heroes at the start of the credits, but I guess Hollywood doesn't like the idea of foreigners being heroes!  <br /> <br />In short, just don't watch it.
B000001ELL|3.0|\\"Dynasty\\" was where it all started to go wrong for Kiss; although the atmosphere surrounding this album was unfocused and disjointed, it still contains some good moments. First and foremost, Peter Criss was absent on most of the album, his drum parts completed by session drummer and David Letterman band member Anton Fig, who would turn up again on the entire \\"Unmasked\\" album in 1980, and later joining Ace Frehley's solo band after he left Kiss.<br /><br />Peter Criss turns up on the track \\"Dirty Livin'\\", his lone contribution to the album; ironically, the song sounds a bit like a \\"cry for help\\", reflecting some of the things he was going through and feeling at the time. Immediately following the 1979 Dynasty tour, Criss was dismissed from the band or quit himself (depending on who you ask) due to his increasingly erratic and unpredictable behavior, or his unhappiness in the band or both (again depending on who you ask).<br /><br />On \\"Dynasty\\", Kiss changed producers to Vini Poncia, who gave the album a more glossy pop sound, even on the heaviest rock tracks. They began experimenting with disco, especially with \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\", which ironically turned out to be their highest charting hit up to that time; even surpassing \\"Beth\\" from just 3 years earlier.<br /><br />Disco was in full swing in 1979, and rockers such as the Rolling Stones and Rod Stewart also embraced it with open arms, both chalking up huge hits. The aforementioned \\"Dirty Livin'\\" also has an unmistakable disco beat, and even Gene Simmons gets into the act by playing some funky pop/slap bass patterns on the song.<br /><br />Of the rest of the songs, the best are contributed by Ace (\\"Hard Times\\", \\"Save Your Love\\" and the Stones' cover \\"2000 Man\\"), and also by Paul Stanley (\\"Magic Touch\\" and the shoulda-been-a-hit \\"Sure Know Something\\"). Gene is surprisingly restrained on the album, contributing only 2 tracks, the self-glorifying \\"Charisma\\" and the strange \\"X-Ray Eyes\\".<br /><br />\\"Dynasty\\" would not be the end of Kiss' experimentations with other sounds, as the trend would continue through the next 3 years and as many albums. Along the way, this would have a devastating effect on the band, first losing Peter Criss and ultimately Ace Frehley, but more importantly, alienating a majority of their hardcore fans in the process.uld not be the end of Kiss' experimentations with other sounds, as the trend would continue through the next 3 years and as many albums.

B00005JMJG|5.0|Quite simply put this movie saved my marriage. <br /> <br />That's all I need to say about it.
B000001ELP|2.0|Kiss hit an all-time low with this album; \\"The Elder\\" was derived from a short story written by Gene Simmons, and the \\"Music From\\" part alluded to a feature film planned to accompany the album, one which never was made; but this was not the only project to be considered. Kiss had planned a full-scale tour based around the story, with each member of Kiss playing a role in the proceedings; that never happened either, and in hindsight, that was probably a good thing.<br /><br />Prior to this, Kiss knew that their fortunes were slipping fast and had to return to their hard rock roots on their next album; pop producer Vini Poncia was thankfully nowhere to be found this time and \\"Destroyer\\" producer Bob Ezrin was called in. The band had recorded rough demos of straight-ahead hard rock songs that they brought to Ezrin, who promptly rejected them all. Four of these songs, \\"Nowhere To Run\\", \\"Partners In Crime\\", \\"Down On Your Knees\\" and \\"I'm A Legend Tonight\\" surfaced a year later on the then-import only \\"Killers\\" album.<br /><br />After Ezrin canned their original songs, he told them that they should record a \\"concept\\" album; when Gene Simmons relayed his story of \\"The Elder\\" to Ezrin, he suggested that Kiss write new songs around it and this would be their new album. Simmons & Paul Stanley were warm to the idea, while new drummer Eric Carr and especially Ace Frehley were strongly against it.<br /><br />When Simmons, Stanley & Carr proceeded to Bob Ezrin's studio in Canada to begin recording, Frehley refused to accompany them and opted to record his parts at his home studio in Connecticut and mail the tapes back and forth to the band.<br /><br />Kiss' new material for \\"The Elder\\" became more \\"progressive\\", relying on orchestration and choirs; somewhat in the same direction as 1976's \\"Destroyer\\", only a lot less focused. The hardest rocking tracks are \\"The Oath\\", \\"Only You\\" and \\"I\\", which was the only single to be released from the album. Songs like the lame \\"Under The Rose\\" and the god-awfully embarassing \\"Odyssey\\" dragged down the proceedings almost to a halt.<br /><br />Frehley's only contributions were the fantastic \\"Dark Light\\", which features arguably the best guitar solo Ace ever recorded as a member of Kiss, and the instrumental \\"Escape From The Island\\" (the flipside of the \\"I\\" single), which really kind of goes nowhere within the context of the album. Frehley has often complained that Ezrin cut out many of the solos he contributed to \\"The Elder\\", some he felt were the best he'd ever done.<br /><br />This is a pretty misguided and strange effort, but even though Kiss should be given some credit for even attempting this, it didn't come without a price...losing many of their longtime fans.and the god-awfully embarassing \\"Odyssey\\" dragged down the proceedings almost to a halt.<br /><br />Frehley's only contributions were the fantastic \\"Dark Light\\", which features arguably the best guitar solo Ace ever recorded as a member of Kiss, and the instrumental \\"Escape From The Island\\" (the flipside of the \\"I\\" single), which really kind of goes nowhere within the context of the album.

B000002UWF|5.0|This is a \\"must have\\" CD for any fan of Louis Prima. This album really SWINGS and even ROCKS at times! There's not a bad cut on it. Backed by his excellent tenor sax man, Sam Butera, Prima blasts through a series of cuts in his own inimitable style, on occasion abeted by the great Keely Smith. Prima was a one-of-a-kind performer whose career spanned the big band era, post-war jazz era and the rock era. If you only get one Louis Prima album, make it this one!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah McLachlan's last effort -- Afterglow -- is brilliant.  It will move you to experience emotions you may not have experienced before.  The lyrics are enticing and the music more so.  I recommend this album whole-heartedly!
B000002OX3|4.0|\\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" was the Who's second album released in 1966.<br /><br />Compared to their first album it's very obvious that Pete Townshend and the band had matured during 1965-66.<br /><br />There is a wider variety in their song-writing, and technically the album are miles ahead of \\"My Generation\\".<br /><br />All members wrote songs to the album, and though both John Enthwistle and Keith Moon contribute strong material like \\"Boris the Spider\\", \\"Whiskey Man\\" and \\"I Need You\\", Pete Townsend is clearly the prolific song-writer in the band.<br /><br />Townshend's mini-opera \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" may not be his most succesful piece of work, but it's quite entertaining and it gives a good hint of what was to come from his pen in near future.<br /><br />Pete Best songs on the album must be \\"So Sad About Us\\" and \\"Don't Look Away\\". Even stronger is the psychedelic \\"Disguises\\", which oddly enough was not included on the British version of the album. Along with the single-version of \\"I'm a Boy\\" and \\"In the City\\", \\"Disguises was included on the European version, which was simple just called \\"The Who\\". \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" was exchange with these great songs, and in my opinion this exchanged made the European album a much better buy. Unfortunately the single-version of \\"I'm a Boy\\" is not added here, which would have been a logical inclusion. Note that the version found on \\"Meaty Beaty . . \\" is an alternate, less powerful version.<br /><br />\\"Man With Money\\", written by the Everly Brothers is a great addition; and the acoustic version of \\"Happy Jack\\" is quite charming.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Check out this movie if you want to find out.  This film did a great job of laying the groundwork for things to come.  It is in a sense the history of how Spiderman came to be, but it is not nearly as boring as your normal history class.  The casting was great in this film from Spiderman/Peter Parker to his Aunt and Uncle to the high school bullies.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.  You will definitely want to watch this more than once.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is such a deep album that it is almost a greatest hits <br />album all on it's own... <br /> <br />You have \\"You really got me\\" that is a cover, but the band <br />sounds so \\"together\\" that it makes this cover great. The <br />you have Runnin with the Devil that just hooks you in! Then <br />you have \\"Ice cream man\\" with is Dave's song really and he <br />does this one really well and I need to give him credit for <br />that. And Jamie's Cryin... I can't understand why this song <br />is disliked! And Eddie just teams it up on \\"Atomic Punk'\\" <br />and the rest is decent or filler. <br /> <br />To me the two underrated tracks are \\"Little Dreamer\\"
B00003CX95|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  The lesson taught about fighting for what you believe in is great.  I've owned it for several years now and I always pop it in on a rainy day.  While it is not the most historically accurate movie it still is very entertaining and enjoyable.  Mel Gibson really did a lot with this movie I must say I was very impressed.  I would highly encourage everyone to see this DVD the commentary by director Mel Gibson and the Behind the Scenes Footage is great.  Definitely worth all 5 stars.

B00005JKL8|4.0|I must say I'm not usually a fan of war movies but this one was quite entertaining.  I'd have to give this movie extremely high marks in cinematography, action, and casting however it was somewhat lacking in plot.  Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman give a great performance.  The only reason this movie did not succeed in the theatres was that people are tired of all the war movies.  This one is better then most.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|After hearing this Album, well, i've been a Celine Fan forever,but i am now a Grandmother of 6, Three of my daughters just had boys this month. I sent the \\"Collection Box of MIRACLE because ,well, i love Anne Geddes as well. But the music. Just the titld song made me reach for the tissues,this is truly a Mothers Heart singing to her child. The song, IF I COULD.. Tells how you would sacrifice everything for them, even till they are grown. If you have a child,baby,know someone who would love such a personal gift of music for their Baby Shower, This IS the gift. I just keep playing it over and over..If your own child just had a baby,what a gift from one Mother to her own.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Wow, I haven't felt this emotional at the end of a movie since Dead Poets Society.  Sean Connery and Rob Brown combine to deliver a stellar performance.  This is truly a touching movie.  It forces you to reflect on who helped you to become the person you are as well as makes you wonder how many missed opportunities there have been to meet someone new that could change your life.  You have got to see this movie.
0596000480|3.0|JavaScript: The Definitive Guide is an excellent reference book. Unfortunately many (if not all) of the examples use Internet Explorer extensions instead of standard methods/properties. For a newbie this can be frustrating when the example in the book does not work. And even then I discovered I had to make changes to some of the examples to work on Internet Explorer 6.0. If the examples used the standard (and only the standard) methods and properties this headache would be reduced and, maybe, eliminated.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Who would have thought that you could combine a teen movie with parts of a Shakespeare play?  I'll be honest I've never been a fan of teen movies but for some reason I really enjoyed this one.  The way this film combined both the seriousness and the unpredictability of high school relationships was great.  In addition the casting and the cinematography was fantastic.
B00005JMXX|4.0|I seldom go to theaters and I rarely rent a DVD... I usually just buy the movies I like and perhaps one in a dozen turns out to be a turkey... I recently had a few that I deeply regretted buying.... \\"Independance Day\\", \\"Armagaddon\\", \\"The Core\\" among the bombs I took to the used CD counter. <br /> <br />The Day After Tomorrow was a real surprise. Yes, it has amazing special effects, but the film does not rely on dazzling effects as entertainment alone. It has a story that involves a few very developed characters. It has atmosphere, authenticity and a great story. Add to that, expert and sensitive foley, sound, and a gorgeous fully-orchestrated symphonic score and you have a huge epic that will keep you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />I give it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I don't know if it will stand the test of time as a classic and I usually only give a GREAT movie 5 stars.... but this film is great fun, great entertainment and gives you a lot of adventure for the buck. Highly recommended.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I like special effects more than most people, but if the story is supposed to be serious, it should not be punctuated by episodes of complete absurdity - it breaks the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" you have to have when watching improbable scenes. <br /> <br />Batman's Mister Freeze worked fine in Batman, because Batman was that kind of story, but the fantasy freeze monster in this movie clashed horribly with the serious climatologists and metorologists.   <br /> <br />It is fine for children and others with no clue as to how weather works.
B00008WG3U|5.0|this was the first punk album i really liked. after one of my friends tried for months to get me in to punk, he gave up, and then i herd errorism and thought it was awsome. that might be due to my likeing of the offspring, because of thier similer styles, but even then, i have never liked any punk eccept nofx and the offspring. this album is not only my favorite punk album, but one of my favorite albums of any kind of music, and i like lots of different types (clasic rock, punk, hard rock, blues, disco, soft rock, funk, folk, ect.). well, anyway it kind of worked as an intro to punk for me, and its so good. It uses the comman fast pased rythem and grinding gritty distorion that most punk has, but the vocals are pretty uniqe. the singer slows it down in to something more easily listenable, with a more structured melody and obviously more understandable lyrics. he still screams and grunts and stuff, but theres something about it that gives a more relaxed fealing, like he's not forcing you to take in his opinions like lots of punk, but hes just sitting on a couch somewhere telling you what he thinks about polotics and stuff, but with bold powerfull music to back him up. of course if your not looking for the whole political message, this is also something great to just have going in the backround of what your doing, and something great to rock to.

B0000026UV|5.0|This album from these two masters of guitar fingerpicking will leave anyone who loves the guitar, country, blues, or melodic rock delighted. I have been a Mark Knopfler fan since early Dire Straits, and learned about Chet Atkins from Mark. Anybody Mark thinks is great is definitely worth a listen. I became a Chet Atkins fan a bit late in life, and this album was a big part of that.<br /><br />This CD shines precisely because it is not flashy or showy; rather it is imbued with craftsmanship and quality musicianship in every bar. The whole album is strong, but I am especially fond of \\"There'll Be Some Changes Made\\" in which Chet and Mark trade good humored jabs about their musical heritage, \\"I'll See You in My Dreams\\", a mastercrafted classic, and the laid back \\"Tahitian Skies.\\" Throughout the CD the vocals are relaxed and effortless, and although Knopfler has an appealing if somewhat gravelly voice, Atkins is a little more atonal and wavering in his singing style. Of course the focus here is not vocal performances, but guitar virtuosity, and that is abundant.<br /><br />This is a CD that will be appreciated by all guitarists who grasp how truly difficult it is to produce a recording this melodious and synchronized, regardless of how easy these two masters make it look. \\"Neck & Neck\\" is highly recommended.
0767827902|5.0|Larry McMurtry is among my favorite contemporary authors and this film is one of the best of those based on his works. Others include Hud (1963), Terms of Endearment (1983), Lonesome Dove (1989), and Texasville (1990). Directed by Peter Bogdanovich and set in fictitious Anarene (Texas) but filmed in Archer City, the focus is primarily on Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges), Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), and Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms). When the film begins, there are several separate but related plots which focus primarily on Duane and Jacy as well as on Sonny, a senior at the regional high school who becomes sexually involved with Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), the love-starved wife of the school's football team coach. Leachman received an Academy Award for her performance in a supporting role as did Ben Jonson for his as \\"Sam the Lion,\\" owner of the Royal Movie Theater. It is worth noting that the last picture shown in it is Howard Hawks's Red River, a director and film which Bogdanovich greatly admires.<br /><br />The acting throughout the cast is outstanding. The film received nine Academy Award nominations and all were deserved. Much as Bogdanovich admires John Ford and Hawks whose western epics are among the finest films ever made, he chose to work  on a much smaller, more intimate scale. (Hopefully there will be no attempt to \\"colorize\\" The Last Picture Show. As with On the Waterfront, for example, it is inconceivable to me that it would be seen other than in black-and-white.) There are moments in this film when poignancy is almost unbearable. Anarene is dying a slow, relentless death. Many adult residents as well as their sons and daughters express frustration and even despair. Anarene's best qualities are revealed by Jonson's portrayal of \\"Sam the Lion\\" but he, like the town, is deteriorating. Because there is more passion (and sometimes lust) than tenderness in most of the personal relationships, his integrity is even more significant. In terms of character, his \\"Sam the Lion\\" provides the film's gravitational center. Credit Bogdanovich and McMurtry with collaborating on a brilliant adaptation of McMurtry's novel and Robert Surtees with (as always) stunning, indeed compelling cinematography. Those such as I who have already seen this film several times can easily recount defining moments in so many memorable scenes. We envy those who see The Last Picture Show for the first time.<br /><br />If those who are curious to know what happened to several of the lead characters many years later, I recommend the sequel, Texasville (1990). You may also enjoy Splendor in the Grass (1961), American Graffiti (1973), and Mystic Pizza (1988) as well as Fried Green Tomatoes and Rambling Rose (both in 1991).Sam the Lion\\" provides the film's gravitational center.

B0001OGVQ2|5.0|WrestleMania 20 where it all begins again!! <br /> <br />Twenty years after the first Wrestlemania in 1985 makes it return to Madison Square Garden, this was overall a decent Wrestlemania, not a great Wrestlemania but decent enough to watch. <br /> <br />Two things that really ruined people's expectations for the anniversary was the lack of Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart at the event who were rumored to be there, but no so. The Big Show vs. Cena match was laugher as Big Show dominated, yet Cena, got a cheap win by hitting Show with brass knuckles. This Wrestlemania <br />also marks the last appearence of Bill Goldberg and Brock Lesnar. Contract disputes between Vince and Goldberg (due mostly to the WWE despite being a million dollar company being cheap) and not wanting to pay the money he ask for. Brock Lesnar left the WWE to try out in the NFL, but that dream has been <br />an utter failure. <br /> <br />Anyhow the card: <br /> <br />Big Show vs. Cena for the US title (already mentioned), somewhat good but a cheap ending spoils. <br /> <br />CruiserWeight invitational: (Featuring one of the last apperarences of Ultimo Dragon) <br /> <br />This was one of the best matches of the night, a great lineup of contenders line up to fight for a shot <br /> <br />at Chavo Guerrero's title : Kidman, Ultimo Dragon, Jamie Noble , Rey Mysterio and many more. Good match.. <br /> <br /> <br />Evolution (Batista , Randy Orton , Ric Flair) in a handicap match against the Rock and Sock Connection <br />(The Rock and Mick Foley) <br /> <br />I have to say pretty disappinting, the Rock has gone Hollywood and he's heart doesn't seem to be in the business all he does is promote his new movies instead of delivering a good show. Mick Foley, despite being the hardcore legend , like Ric Flair, is way too old to wrestle, and the further he stays in the ring, the more damage he does to his body. <br /> <br />The match was made between a good rivalrry between Orton and Foley, where Foley received a brutal beating at the hands of Evolution, a concussion. <br /> <br />Foley and Rock gain a measure of revenge, but the match itself, eh, the ending was never in doubt. <br /> <br /> <br />Evening Gown Match: Sable and Tori Wilson vs. Jackie and Stacey Kiebler. <br /> <br />Enjoyable!!! Say what you want but these matches are what gives the WWE some of their biggest ratings. <br /> <br />The Divas despite having limited talent can draw an audience since most of their audience are male viewers. <br /> <br />Molly vs Victoria for the Women's title. <br /> <br />Victoria is definitely one of the sexiest women to ever grace <br />the squared circle. Not only that but she is very tough in the <br />ring reminiscent of Chyna. Good match, oh yeah the loser also had to get their head shaved. <br /> <br />Christian vs. Chris Jericho <br /> <br />Great match, everyone knows Jericho can bring it, always has , always will. Christian has really come to his own since his old tag team days, but he is now a legitimate singles wrestler. The setup for the match was that Christian has stabbed Jericho in the back and has tried to go after his girlfriend Trish Stratus  and thus we have the match. The rivalry wouldn't end here, Jericho and Christian would deliver the goods  at Unforgiven in a unforgettable ladder match. <br /> <br /> <br />Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero for the WWE title.. Good match though I am not a fan of Eddie Guerrero I think his heel character and his persona is insulting to the Hispanic Community. <br /> <br /> <br />Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar. Good match, though its obvious  that both wrestlers know their both leaving. <br /> <br />Stone Cold was the referee, but in reality he shouldnt have been placed here as Austin is nothing more than a show stealer. <br /> <br />Golderrgs lays a spear and a jackhammer to finish of Lesnar coming of his embarassing defeat to Eddie Guerreo <br /> <br /> <br />Triple Match for the World Title Sean Michaels vs. Chris Benoit vs. TripleH. <br /> <br />Outstanding!! Chris Benoit has always been a main event player, he has been cheated over the years, putting over guys yet never getting his shot at the title. Triple H is overrated and continues to embarass himself by resorting to cheap moves and weapons to secure his title. <br /> <br />Sean Michaels well is Sean Michaels, but Chris Benoit is the highlight of this match since he would win the World Title and etch himself into Madison Square History by winning the title. <br /> <br />A long time coming for Benoit the best technical wrestler in the WWE since the days of Bret Hart.
0789723107|5.0|Steve Krug wrote this book a couple of years ago but the advice is timeless and easy to understand.  You won't be overwhelmed reading this book because Steve writes in a breezy, humorous common sense way.  He spends a great deal of time explaining the what, how and why of useability testing.  I own several websites and never heard of this term until I read this book!  Now I know excactly how to do the testing on a tiny budget.  There is lots of good advice in this book for entrepreneurs and corporations alike!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I do not really care for Green Day that much except for a couple songs off Dookie back in the day a long time ago. And when I thought I'd give the album a try (besides the title track) I was completely astounded. It's absolutely marvelous from start to finish. To tell the truth. The title track doesn't fit the album! It's not really punk at all, as I'm not into punk music in the first place. The songs are very melodic, catchy riffs, some deeper lyrics and just stuff the normal rock n roll person can like without being \\"punk\\". I like a couple slow songs on the album too. It shows diversity and I definitely see more hits on this album. I CANT STOP LISTENING TO IT!!! Every song blends into the next one and it's just pretty cool. GOOD JOB GREEN DAY! DEfinitely one of the best albums of the year! 5 stars!!!
0393035158|5.0|This is an engrossing and thought-provoking book written with intelligence and passion.  One is almost tempted to declare it first-rate historical entertainment but for the importance of its message and the sobering nature of its content.  The book reads quickly, its like taking in a vivid historical mural, millennial in scope, splayed out before the reader, it's filled with action, broad-ranging insights, and focusing ideas.  The narrative is well researched and masterfully punctuated with intimate scenes from period documents recounting the twisted rationales and chilling details of assorted barbarisms visited upon multitudes of unfortunate souls, tortured and exterminated by the religious fanatics of the time.      Mr. Harris' thesis is straightforward, in a nutshell: The fanatical faithful have historically been and continue to be given intellectual credibility and license by moderate leaders and adherents of the various religions.  Who themselves put their faith in the same unaccountable supernatural deities and the latitudes of their scriptural directives.  And while this may have only occasionally lead to mass hysterias and slaughter on a grand scale in the past, in today's world, with the growing list of methods of mass devastation manageable by a few neophytes, clearly the prospects for the growth in such horrific events will be magnified.  The end of faith in baseless ignorant beliefs may not stop every act of misguided horror, but for those that it does, it'll be a well-appreciated triumph of objective knowledge and reason, over ignorance and superstition.    Can we, will we, continue to continence the wholesale teaching of backward baseless beliefs to the world's children?  Mr. Harris has misgivings that we will.  Nevertheless his book is a top-down call for a new direction in thinking, the beginning of a broad global dialog to understand the human condition, one that seeks to explore and find a common understanding that relies on evidence first, subjective impressions second, and on unaccountable supernatural deities never!  `The End of Faith' is timely, vital, and important, not to read it, is to miss a turn in the road.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I feel a bit like comic book guy from the simpsons writing this review, but really the movie had plot holes big enough to cover the distance from washington d.c. to philidelphia (which appearently you can traverse most of that distance on foot). Seeing this movie I seriously began to believe the world might come to an end, not from global warming but from an economy crashing because of millions of dollars being spent on horrible movies (ed wood must be rolling over in his grave for not recieving an oscar for plan 9). But please, I beg you, if you are to purchase this movie you will be contributing to the decline of western civilization, and could very well assist in the crash of global economies and who knows, maybe it would cause wolves to chew their way through metal fences to escape from zoos. Terribly unacceptable portrayal of an intelligent societies reaction to nature. Worst movie ever!
0393035158|5.0|I'm too old to be frustrated anymore by people who begin with a premise such as, \\"I hate religion,\\" or \\"I hate America\\" and then work backwards to rationalize their conclusions (which were not conclusions at all). Does Mr. Harris really believe that crazy people will stop acting crazy in the absense of religious faith? The fact is, there are nutty people in the world. Men, women, Democrats, Republicans, Iraqis, Americans, religious fanatics, agnostics. To condemn the person's affiliations because of his actions does nothing more than insult millions of people and misdirect the problem onto something about which Mr. Harris doesn't understand yet has abundant contempt.

B000000I0Q|5.0|Steve Hackett's first solo disc is a beautiful, complex alternately entrancing and terrifying first effort.     Freed of the constraints of Genesis (who were, according to Gabriel becoming VERY set in their ways, plus Steve's contributions were rather minimalized in the context of the band), Steve wrote a set of very personal music encompassing many moods from beautiful and pastoral (\\"Hands of The Priestess I & II\\") to terrifying (\\"A Tower Struck Down\\"), frenetic (\\"Ace of Wands\\") pensive (\\"The Hermit\\") and so much more.     Unlike many guitarists solo discs, Steve doesn't set out ot blow you away with displays of chops but rather lets the songs be the star. He gets plenty of capable help from his bandmates Phil Collins (also singing on the beautiful \\"Sirius The Star\\"), Mike Rutherford as well as other notables on the English prog-rock scene at the time (for instance Mike Oldfield's sister Sally does an amazing vocal turn on \\"Shadow of The Heirophant\\"). In particular, Collins' drumming here just smokes, especially on \\"Ace Of Wands\\" {listening to this however makes me sad to realize that his drumming has since gone completely down the sewer, it hurt even more to hear him in interviews years later totally slamming Genesis' work from this period as that \\"silly progressive music\\", but that's another rant).     Back to the subject at hand, this was the start of Steve's rather varied and ecclectic solo career. Some Hackett discs are brilliant, some are rather cheesy but this one is a five-star barnburner! Highly recommended    PS: Great Halloween-type cuts include \\"Tower Struck Down\\" and the last part of \\"Shadow of The Heirophant\\", play these and watch the spooks come flying out of the speakers.
0767817478|1.0|this movie is the only godzilla movie i do not like. the story is dull and uninteresting, and the characters are 1 dimensional(meaning they have no qualities or reason to watch). It was a good idea to make an american version of godzilla, but dean devlin and roland emmerich did'nt carry the idea through. They erased godzilla's(the real godzilla)little respect he had in the states. the new design for \\"godzilla\\" looked too dinosaue like, raptor to be exact. plus, a majority of the destruction in the film was caused by the helicopters trying to destroy godzilla(and everytime i am forced to endure this films horribleness, i wish they do). also, in the original, godzilla was a metaphor for the atom bomb dropped in hiroshima, and had value, character construction and a good message, this film has none of the qualities of that film or the series that followed. i urge you not to waste your money on this film, instead go by a real godzilla movie.
B00028HBKM|1.0|A lot of reviewers are writing reviews that read like novellas, so I am going to say it simply.  Mel Gibson's movie would have been better named THE PASSION OF GORE & VIOLENCE.  Ultra-violent to the extreme, it completely ignores WHO Jesus was.  This is a movie for idiots.<br /><br />Go rent Halloween or Friday the 13th instead.  At least they have plots.
B00006690G|5.0|I just had to stand up for my boy after reading the bad reviews that some of you are giving him.  I'm not that much of a fan of his other cds but this one is DEFINATELY worth owning.  every rap fan should keep a spare in the visor of thier car and their cd case at home.  Best rap cd out.

B000008HZB|4.0|Armchair Theatre appeared during a lull in the music world, (which in Cincinnati could mean any day,) and as a result, it got absolutely zilch as far as airplay.  It deserved better.  Jeff Lynne's collection of friends alone should have earned some airplay, but the fact of the matter is, very few people know who Jeff Lynne is.  ELO aside, he was never quite a household name, but he demonstrates his uncanny ability to bend and shape even the distinctive guitar of George Harrison into his signature sound.  Far and away, the best cuts on here are \\"Every Little Thing\\" and \\"Blown Away\\", but there is nothing that isn't at least listenable on this album.  OOP or not, this is a pretty decent effort, guaranteed not to offend anyone within listening distance.<br /><br />Happy Birthday, Mom.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|This CD okay, but it is not all of that. Being, the great artist that she is, I expected a lot more form her. Some of the songs on the CD were so boring they would put you to sleep. They sounded like they were from the early 70's. WAKE UP, no-one wants to listen to this anymore. If she would have had some more songs on there like her two singles, then here CD would've been off da chain.  She is very talanted and she has a beautiful voice, she needs to use it a lot more than what she is doing now.
B0000025FG|3.0|While Out Of The Blue hinted at the new direction for the band, Discovery grabbed the wheel and forcibly steered ELO toward a more dance oriented sound.  \\"Shine A Little Love\\" and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" received major airplay, but also heavy rotation at discos all around the world.  Long time fans were left feeling abandoned, and the band's fortunes began a slide that slowly ate away the foundation that had been built on Face The Music and A New World Record.  After this, things would never be the same.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore's film is basically a propaganda piece.  He out right lies in this film.  There are several things that moore had to know were not true, and could of corrected and didn't.  However, I STILL RECOMMEND THAT PEOPLE SEE IT.  Then watch FarienHYPE 9/11, the rebuttal.  Watch them both together. I believe in political speech, and I think you should hear what Michael Moore has to say.

B0000025DV|4.0|Coming on the heels of two killer albums in Face The Music and A New World Record, Out Of The Blue was the album that formally introduced the masses to ELO, while making longtime fans ask just where it all was headed.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great album, but in all of it's slick studio polish it the band loses some of it's charm.  While not as disco influenced as the next album, Discovery, it shows an alarming and unfortunate tendency to sacrifice the band's \\"electric classical\\" approach for a more commercially slick sound loaded with synths.  A pretty good album on it's own merits, but the old guard had a feeling something ill was being borne on the wind.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is the most controversial film of the year. To the media and public memory its worse than The Passion of the Christ. The movie has images and files not seen on the news with humor and sarcastic points. But this is Moore's most serious film where he knows that the facts mean more than the candid apperances. You can hate Bush or love Bush but hating this film without ever seeing it makes you a hyprocrite. Whether you are Democratic or Republican or in between go see this movie. This is the best thing to independent media.    Here are some points on the film and American society:  1. If you dont believe Moore's claims then go to his website (...) with factual back up  2. It's not anti american to question the president. Thats what Moore did and our founding fathers did in 1776.  3. Why do people only question Moore than these other books and films? Is it because he has personality?  4. Remember that Saddam did not attack us, Bin Laden did and he is NOT in Iraq.  5. The title Don't Knock It Before You Try It are a reference to a Ben Harper song  6. GO VOTE!
B0000025DR|5.0|On their fifth album, Jeff Lynne and company finally put it all together.  Face The Music is the band's first bonafide masterpiece, eight songs without a clunker in the bunch.  \\"Evil Woman\\" and \\"Strange Magic\\" are the two big hits from this album, but the instrumental \\"Fire On High\\" may well be the best known song, having been used for years as the ABC Wide World Of Sports closing theme.  \\"Waterfall\\", \\"Night Rider\\" and \\"One Summer Dream\\", while never huge radio hits, help round out what it the band's first front to back classic.  With the exception of the odd but endearing \\"Down Home Town\\", Face The Music is a smooth, seamless spin that leaves you wanting more, the perfect setup to A New World Record.
B0002IU988|4.0|Alter Bridge knows how to paint the genre \\"Emo Rock\\"... and paints it well. For a long time, I have not heard such passion and sincerity from any band, not even its disbanded predecessor, Creed. The New Singer's voice is embroiled in energetic optimism; rather than being disgruntled, Alter Bridge conveys hope and joy. \\"Open your eyes\\" is an outstanding track, both melodically appealing and thematically thought-provoking. \\"Burn it down\\", \\"In loving memory\\" and \\"Shed my skin\\" are other standout tracks, capturing not only the sweet, crispy voice of myles kennedy, but shows off (in a positive sense) the superior technical ability of guitarist Tremonti. <br /> <br />If you're in any way a rock fan, Alter Bridge is likely to be immensely entertaining. Or, if you appreciate brilliant guitar solos, then Mark Tremonti's inclusion alone should justify your listening of this album. A great effort by an exceptional band.
0767805712|4.0|I could tell you the plot of the movie. But after reading the many reviews already posted before me, I suggest you just read on to the others. The reason for my writing this is to tell you why this movie, in my mind's eye, stands head and shoulders above Science Fiction films w/ the exception of Ridley Scott's \\"Alien\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\". (Lest we not forget about Stanley Kubrick also.)  <br />  Gattaca is way ahead of it's time in dealing with a (\\"very\\") possible future. It asks questions of what constitutes perfection in a society which is inherently flawed. The film portrays a future which appears sterile and, seemingly, totalitarian. Mankind's status becomes solely judged not on wealth but on one's genetic structure. Preferably, those who were chosen to be genetically altered (by the Birth Parents, no less) to be the \\"Perfect(ed)\\" individual. Those who were conceived \\"Naturally\\" with no genetic tampering to \\"improve the condition\\" of the individual are seen as weak. Thus, defining their status as the lowest form of life in Man's eyes. To be \\"perfect\\" is to be \\"prefect\\" from all the others.(Ironically, as shallow as this film seems in it's theme, it's not far off from how we perceive ourselves today. Especially in the media and entertainment.)  <br />  This film asks the questions of how we define \\"perfection\\" in ourselves and our surroundings. Where do we draw the line in a world which draws closer to genetic manipulation. This is what makes this film original. Not just in scope, but in it's ideal themes. It questions humanity and the \\"human spirit\\".                                                          The amazing thing of this film is the lack of special effects. The cinematography, on the other hand, is stunning and visceral. At times, it feels as if you're looking at a painting which helps realize the environment even more. What's even more fascinating is the lack of special effects. It's based more on the mood and pace of the film & characters which help this amazing film. This may not be \\"The Matrix\\". Nor was it a commercial success at the time of release. But the philosophical themes and ideals couldn't be more realized.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|...it sucked....and I returned it! <br /> <br />That's about all I can say about the album.   There is nothing redeemable about this album.  What an inferior album from an artist of superior talent!!!
B0006213WG|4.0|Any music group that has the guts to stand up and speak their mind I salute with the utmost respect. Regardless that is a pop punk/metal group from Canada. The  personal political references gives me goose bumps and makes me appreciate THE FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION AND CREATIVITY. And the music has blossomed into some kind of metal thing with driving riffs and double kick drums. Very recommended for any music fan of any genre. DON'T BE FEARFUL...it's just Sum 41.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I love these types of films.  A movie of alternate realities where each small shift in the past causes a completely different present.  Each time you watch in anticipation of the twist for the new reality.<br /><br />Kutcher is a troubled youth who was molested along with a young girl, by the girl's father and later is bullied by the girl's brother.  The girl ends up committing suicide and Kutcher's life is haunted by his past.  Kutcher is told by his analyst to keep a diary of everything that happens.  In his college years, Kutcher finds that when he re-reads his diary, he is suddenly transported back to the actual events depicted in the diary. Each time Kutcher tries to make some adjustment to that event, to try to make things turn out better.  But like the story of the butterfly that caused a tidal wave to occur, each little \\"adjustment\\" for the good has a ripple effect on the future that causes not necessarily pleasant results.<br /><br />I was riveted by this movie until the end.  The DVD comes with an alternate ending.  I suggest you watch the regular ending first (it is the better of the two) before view the director's cut.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|Wow, what a great cd. First I gotta say, this album is for grown ups. If you want some poppy glittery album, go check out Britney's cd. Diary Of Alicia Keys is soulful & sexy, I really couldn't find any fault's in this album. \\"Dragon Days,\\" \\"Diary,\\" and \\"Karma\\" are my favorite cuts on the album. Anyone who liked her first album will like this one. Be sure to pick this album up. Gotta love the gritty hip hop beats along-side great instrumentation, damn this album is hot.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Having attended some of the conventions for old television series (Star Trek, Dark Shadows), I could really relate to this movie.  The atmosphere and the attitude of the fans at some of these conventions are captured exactly by the director.<br /><br />In this movie, the actors from on old television series very much like Star Trek, attend a convention.  They are harangued by the fans and peppered with questions about the science in some of the more obscure episodes.  Tim Allen is the William Shatner like character of the series and he meets some weird \\"fans\\" that ask him for help.  Tim laughingly agrees.  What he doesn't realize is that these are not fans but in actuality real aliens that think Allen is his persona in the TV series.  On their planet they do not know what a lie or acting is so they accept Allen's \\"offer\\" of help and whisk him to a spaceship in another part of the solar system.<br /><br />Allen then has to convince his co-stars to help the aliens and they agree not realizing what they are up against.  They must battle an alien warlord who is ruthless as Star Trek's Khan.<br /><br />There are some hilarious scenes in this movie that literally had me splitting my sides, especially with the actor who plays the ship's engineer (he is the same actor from the Monk tv series).<br /><br />Much funnier and better conceived than Spaceballs!
B000059Z8J|5.0|The late Christopher Reeve skyrocketed to super stardom, launching a new genre of movies along the way, as \\"The Man Of Steel\\" in 1978's \\"Superman\\". Sadly, Reeve passed away October 10, 2004 from heart failure after suffering either a heart attack, slipping into a coma from which he would never awaken. The movie itself is classic: Oscar winners Marlon Brando (\\"The Godfather\\", \\"Apocalypse Now\\", etc) and Gene Hackman (\\"The French Connection\\", \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\", etc.) shared top billing for this movie, with Christopher Reeve, a relative unknown at the time, though he had appered in bit parts in movies like \\"Midway\\", coming in third. The strategy worked like a charm, because not only did he closely resemble the hero of the comic strip, but also because he played the part perfectly. The special effects were flawless (the film won an Oscar for Special Achievement in Visual Effects), proving that a man CAN fly. Marlon Brando was paid $10 million for 10 minutes of screen time (he appeared in the beginning as Jor-El, Superman's real father). Gene Hackman proved he could play a cartoonish villain after violent roles in films like \\"The French Connection\\". Glen Ford (\\"Blackboard Jungle\\", Midway\\", etc) appears in a small role as Jonathan Kent, Superman's adoptive father. Terence Stamp and the other two who played the Krypton renegades on trial at the beginning would appear in \\"Superman II\\". Margot Kidder, who played Superman's love interest, Lois Lane, did a wonderful job, becoming one of Christopher Reeve's closest friends, both on/off screen. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty provide comic relief along with Hackman (as Lex Luthor, who would go on to appear in \\"Superman II\\" and \\"Superman IV\\") as his henchmen Otis and Miss Tessmaucher (who becomes good at the movie's climax.) John Willaims' score is irrevocably classic, identifying itself immeadiately as the main theme from \\"Superman\\", adding it to his scores from the six \\"STAR WARS\\" movies (\\"Episode III\\" to be released in theaters next summer), \\"Indiana Jones\\" and \\"Jurassic Park\\" movies, among others. Richard Donner (\\"The Omen\\", \\"Lethal Weapon\\" quadrilogy, \\"Ladyhawke\\", etc.) provides 8 minutes not seen in theaters, which enhance the film's exposition and moves ahead with the action. Also, the sound has been remixed and the widescreen format allows you to experience the picture the way the director wanted it. I have no idea why the two scenes that show up under 'deleted scenes' were cut from the film. The 2nd one would've been better if it had been restored into the picture, because it gives us an idea of the cruel way Lex wanted to punish Miss Tessmaucher. But, its showing up on DVD is okay.<br /><br />My favorite scene is when Superman and Lois are flying over New York City, that is just beautiful. Although the film is based on a cartoon character, I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 5 years of age, though there might be some who'll enjoy the movie, no matter what. It would be nothing less than an insult to Christopher Reeve's memory to make \\"Superman V\\". The majority of people consider Christopher Reeve to be the only person who could play Superman. Memo to Warner Bros.: If you persist in making \\"Superman V\\", it'll be the biggest mistake you've ever done, because \\"Superman\\" is one of your most popular film franchises (not only yours, but in the history of movies, there has never been such a thing as a movie franchise, like the \\"James Bond 007\\" or \\"STAR WARS\\" movies that haven't gotten A TON of hype prior to its wide release). It'll be a DISASTER for you, unless you make it (if you persist on it), do what Blake Edwards did for \\"Trail Of The Pink Panther\\": put Lois Lane (Margot Kidder, of course) to remeniscence about Superman/Clark Kent (Christopher Reeve, showing up only in shots from the four films) before he was killed by kryptonite, making it a montage of footage from all four movies, releasing it in theaters nationwide. That would be,in my opnion, the best option if you want this franchise to end with a bang. Or, if you're thinking of continuing the series (bad idea unless you want the franchise to stink after four successful movies), you could put Dean Cain (TV's \\"Lois And Clark\\" and \\"Clubhouse\\", airing on CBS) in the role instead of another actor and release it straight to video/DVD. Do that, I think it'll go a lot better or don't make it at all. Why did the MPAA say that this movie had sensuality, even making it 'mild sensuality'? There was no sensuality in this movie and the 'mild language' was only one 'damn', one  'hell' and one 'a--'. Nothing worth mentioning. Same thing with \\"STAR WARS Episode IV\\", the 'brief mild language' only consisted of two 'damn's and one 'hell'. No big deal. Also, the packaging for this movie could've been better, instead of those cheap cardboard boxes. Rated PG for peril.anchise to end with a bang.

B00030590I|5.0|I have not seen the US theatrical release because the week that it opened in San Francisco the Chinese DVD version was available in Chinatown. I bought it and the only problem was trying to figure out how to play the movie with English subtitles. I highly recommend it. The story, acting and the cinamatographry is excellent. I'm looking forward for the US DVD release so I can compare the differences between both (China & US) releases. I feel so lucky to have found the Chinese release, by the way the DVD package is great too! Buy it if you can get your hands on it. GO FOR IT!
B000025RX4|5.0|The preceding reviewers have perfectly assembled the essential greatness of this record.  Buy it. Buy it now!  Johnny Winter is simply one of the best guitarists of all time!  I first saw him in 1969 at the Denver Pop Festival...an incredible bonus to my pilgrimage to see Jimi.  Johnny was a blues purist yet to be fully amped up which, at 16, I could not yet appreciate. But from a steady diet of Hendrix, supplemented with licks from Cream and morsels from Zappa, I had a pretty good idea of what great guitarists were all about.  Johnny Winter had it all. <br /> <br />A year later, I saw Johnny Winter And touring on this record at the old KRNT theatre in Des Moines.  Unbelievable!  As the previous reviewer suggested of the show he saw at the Fillmore: maximum decibels delivering maximum pleasure.  Winter and Rick Derringer live was a wonder to behold.  I bought this record just before the concert and, over the next year, I listened to it constantly.  Still do. <br /> <br />Now, 35 years later, all the great things said before remain true.  And the only addition I can make to the insights that my predecessors have made is that the vocal work on this record is a magnificent time capsule of a style of singing unique to rock recordings at the beginning of the '70s.  \\"Am I Here\\" and, even more so, \\"Out On A Limb\\" showcase this style.  It is a lost art but anyone who lived through the period knows it as organic when they hear it.   <br /> <br />Johnny Winter has made great music all of his professional life and guitar fans know him to be one of the true masters.  This record is essential for so many reasons, not the least of which is that you know how he got here from there.
B0002858YS|5.0|Ok, first off I'm almost 40 years old, so when it comes to 80s music, I know it, lived it, and loved it.  With that in mind, I'll have to say that this album went beyond my expectations as to what passes for \\"80s retro\\" these days.  This album truly brings back what the early 80s \\"alternative\\" and modern rock was all about, and added a bit of pop in it. Almost every song in this album has a hook in it!  There's a bit of New Order, U2, Duran Duran, The Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Modern English, The Cars, and other 80s styles sprinkled all over this album.  It's almost as if this band took the BEST of all the riffs in 80s new wave/alt-rock and pasted it all over this album. But, what I like the most about this album is that all the songs are all original material and don't exactly rip off any one song or band.  Long story short...this album is a MUST keep.  Get it now!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Ok, i don't mean to nitpick but that's exactly what i'm doing, your idea about the message of the cd is interesting and well thought out but ultimately wrong. I mean c'mon, when has there ever been a liberal media? All of the news stations are owned by Rupert Murdock, one of the biggest conservatives @$$holes in recent history, and allmost all of america's airwaves are owned by clearchannel, who's ceo is a friend of the bush family and after the current prez got rid of the bill blocking monopolies clearchannel bought allmost all of the radio stations. It's a conservative media creating lies, fear, and ducktape sales. Don't  belive me? watch fox news for 5 minutes. <br /> <br />also (from idiot american):  <br /> <br />Well maybe I'm the f----t America. <br />I'm not a part of a redneck agenda. <br /> <br />and (from holiday):  <br /> <br />\\"The representative from California has the floor\\" <br /> <br />Sieg Heil to the president gasman <br />Bombs away is your punishment <br />Pulverize the Eiffel towers <br />Who criticize your government <br />Bang bang goes the broken glass man <br />Kill all the f--s that don't agree <br />Trials by fire, setting fire <br />Is not a way that's meant for me <br /> <br />if you can't piece any of these lines to anything that has happenned in the past 4 years you definintly need to get out of that rock and think for a moment. <br /> <br />And also, to the ppl who said 'if you don't get this cd then you're a republican'. Being closed minded about things like that makes you the equal of the dumbest republican. I mean this guy was able to find something he identified with even though he's a republican. <br /> <br />Ok, enough of that, what can i say about the cd? well, i can't stop listening to it for one, i never listened to greenday before but now i definintly will, and it's definintly one of the best cd's i've heard in awhile, and you can't just listen to parts of it, you NEED to hear it all the way through.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|Before the youthful Luke Skywalker learned to be a Jedi Knight, the youthful Prince Valiant learned to be a knight in King Arthur's court.  Hal Foster's Sunday comic strip was a logical story to bring to the screen, in the wake of MGM's \\"Ivanhoe\\" and \\"Knights of the Round Table\\", when \\"sword epics\\" were getting their second wind.    As a film, \\"Prince Valiant\\" works rather well on several fronts, although there are a couple of minor drawbacks.  One is the casting of Sterling Hayden as Sir Gawain, a role that should have brought more of a combination of heroic ego and a bit of comic relief.  Another bit of questionable casting is that of Victor McLaglen as the leader of the Christian Vikings.  He's barely recognizable behind that beard, but the moment when he first opens his mouth - and that Irish brogue spills forth - will lift a few eyebrows.  The Vikings are all stereotypes, of course, complete with horned helmets and burly beards.  In fact, when shown as a group, they look like a cattle call for mascot auditions at a Minnesota football game.    But the positive aspects of this movie rule the day.  James Mason makes a fine villain, just the kind everyone would \\"love to hate\\".  My guess is that 1954 must have been Mason's year.  Besides \\"Prince Valiant\\", he starred opposite Judy Garland in \\"A Star is Born\\", and created perhaps his greatest role, that of Captain Nemo in Disney's \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\".  Robert Wagner as Valiant is on shaky ground at the film's start, but he proves himself at the end.  The late Janet Leigh makes a most beautiful \\"damsel in distress\\", and the almost overlooked Debra Paget matches Leigh's beauty in the role of her sister.  The final, climactic sword duel must rank in excitement with the ones in \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" and the more recent \\"Rob Roy\\".    Franz Waxman's score is one of his finest in a long career, full of melody and swagger.  If the exhuberant opening main title music doesn't positively lift you out of yourseat, I suggest you make an appointment for an MRI.    The print is fine, with lively color to go with the always slightly defocused Cinemascope image (Technirama and Panavision would later prove to be far better in both picture and sound).  Overall, a very good piece of entertainment, guaranteed to send a rush.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Since I live in Virginia, I was happy to see that Fox actually used the real station. Fox 5 news.    As everyone should know, what made this movie great was the special effects. Some great on the tornados and on the wave. I also liked looking at New York City turned into a big block of ice.    Since that's pretty much what makes this movie entertaining, I'll get to my favorite scenes, shots, angles, whatever you want to call them. Most of them are total CG shots of course, but I like CG.    1.)The shot where the water begins rising and the angle does a little 90 degree rotation around the statue of liberty.  2.)The shot where they go to the live footage of the helicopter flying into L.A. while all the tornadoes are destroying the city.  3.)The part where the helicopters fly into the eye, and they do a shot from aove the storm, where the audience can see the helicopters inside.  4.)Of course, the shot where the tornado destroys the Hollywood sign.  5.)(second favorite shot) The shot where the news guy is trying to give a live report about the tornadoes, but a huge sign falls on him.  6.)All the shots of the frozen New York City.  7.)(favorite shot) The shot where the audience sees a ship stuck in the ice, but then the anlge shifts and the audience sees the statue of liberty sticking out of the ice and snow, all frozen.    Some great shots. Definately did a good job with the CG.     I think this is a very entertaining film, and has some of the most impressive special effects as well as shots, angles, whatever, I have seen in any movie. (Except for \\"Dawn of the Dead 2004\\" those were some really good shots)     If Mexico would not let the American people in, I would have just taken them over. Kill every Mexican if I had to. I say do what you have to do to save your people in a time like that.    I also want to say this. There is no global warming problem. Accept it.
B00005JMXX|2.0|The Day After Tomorrow isn't a bad film; it is an incredibly weak film. There are some nice special effects but those are too few and far between to carry the movie. The only saving grace of the movie is Dennis Quaid and Jake Gyllenhall. Both are good actors but have given better performances. The movie could have easily been written by pulling formula pieces out of a hat and I wouldn't be surprised if that is how it was written. If you think a movie like The Core is great, then you will love The Day After Tomorrow. If you must see it, save your money and rent it. Then you won't suffer the embarrassment of friends seeing it in your collection and asking \\"You bought that?!?!\\"
B000069AUI|1.0|Some good songwriting and tunes here, but it's hard to get past Coldplay's blatent riffoff of U2's style. They will never equal the brillance of U2, and would do much better to establish their own sound instead. The singer's outright theft of Bono's trademark style is unconvincing and rather embarrassing to say the least.
6305252521|5.0|\\"The Truman Show\\" is a film I often come back to, occasionally, because its premise is so unique and compelling. Certainly, it's a parable and a fantasy; Peter Weir has quite simply added another brilliant film to his awesome filmography. Jim Carrey was expected to be insanely funny because everyone thought he was nuts to begin with. As a previous reviewer said, that's what we expected from Robin Williams, too, and Adam Sandler (\\"Punch-Drunk Love\\"). Carrey's performance is so very complete, a wonderful display of sensitivity and focus. I was impressed. Mr. Weir's vision I'm sure had a lot to do with it all, and Laura Linney's performance was much under-rated. Ed Harris was customarily over-reactive. This is a fantasy to be enjoyed and not analyzed at first glance; let it take you in, and question your own mortality. This is a film about self-esteem. For that reason alone, Jim Carrey flies beyond his reputation.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out and couldn't believe how good the soound was. Everything was clear as a bell. Palaces sounded a little muffled to me. This CD is one I am able to put in a listen front to back every song is amazing. <br />Key Tracks: <br />Omerta <br />Break You <br />Blood Of The Scribe <br />Hourglass <br />Ashes Of The Wake
B000003TA4|1.0|Listen to the intro to \\"Peace of Mind\\" by Boston, then the intro to \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by this awful group of Talent-Less losers. Tell me you dont hear an odd similarity <br /> <br />KURT COMPLAIN IS WORTHLESS <br /> <br />get Appetite for Destruction by Guns N Roses instead of this god-awful waste of a compact disc
6302787300|4.0|This movie was fantastic. The only fault is that Christopher columbus was not really Italian. in fact, was born in Spain - Cataluna, to be exact. Beside this, the movie is close enough historically.
B000003TAB|1.0|Nirvana is the worst band to ever have the misfortune of being put together. Kurt Complain, or whatever his name is, is painful to listen to. I (as well as alot of people) measure a musician, by ability to play and ability to create. People, Kurt has neither. If you want real rock, get Appetitie for Destruction by Guns N Roses.
B00013BN4S|5.0|This is one of the best debut albums I've heard. It would establish a style that would continue to evolve over the course of her career. The album is eclectic and achingly beautiful. The emotion is so raw and captivating. She does a great cover of The Beatles \\"For No One\\", the Louvin Brothers' \\"If I Could Only Win Your Love\\" (a hit for her), and of course one of the most stirring pieces of music she's ever recorded, the song \\"Bolder to Birmingham\\", a tribute to her mentor Gram Parsons (she puts her stamp on a lot of his songs throughout her career). A must have!
055357342X|2.0|I must admit that I enjoyed reading the first 2 books in this series, but this one just started to drag.  The author is full of himself to use \\"R.R.\\" in his name like Tolkien, but he doesn't come close.  He is so concerned with producing 10 lb books that he can't generate the next volume within a decent time frame.  It would serve us all right if he croaks before he can finish this overblown series. <br /> <br />As a lover of LOTR, my only problem with Tolkien was that he has inspired too many authors that are unable or unwilling to finish a story line within a reasonable number of volumes or pages.  Methinks guys like Martin are more concerned with hooking readers into a life-time annuity of income for themselves rather than actually concluding a story.  Or perhaps he has created so many interrelated story lines that even he can't figure out how to end it!
B00005OM4N|5.0|When it first came out i wasn't really interested in buying it but now after such a long time i finally get it i it really is such a great album, there are many songs on it that are more grown up then her previous albums like 'Slave 4 U' and 'boys' but she has some songs with similar sound from her previous albums like 'anticipating' which actually sounds like a spice girls song, overall this album is really great and deffenetly deserves a listen.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This CD is awesome! I love it! It might never leave my Cd player. I'm hoping that Nightwish will become big in the U.S. That would rock!OK so here are my song reviews. <br />1. Dark Chest of Wonders- Awesome pick for the first song. Heavy with some great lyrics.10 Stars. <br />2. Wish I had an Angel- I don't know why I love this song so much but I do. 10 stars! <br />3. Nemo- This is it. Can't get any better than this. 10! <br />4. Planet Hell- sounds like it's off the Van Helsing soundtrack for anyone who's familiar with the movie.  Great song, awesome lyrics. 10 <br />5.Creek Mary's Blood- I like this one. Right here, Tuomas' favorite song. I understand why. 10. <br />6. The Siren- Ok, not my favorite. I like it, but I need to listen to it a little bit more to get used to it.8 stars <br />7.Dead Gardens- I like this one a lot, must likely because of the lyrics. 10 <br />8. Romanticide- Not even bothering I love the heavy sound 10 <br />9.Ghost Love Score- This is it. The best song ever! Tuomas I salute you for this one. 10 minutes of the best song ever. <br />10.Can't spell it- Ok, I know. I cannnot spell the title of this song. It's all in Finnish. It's pretty, but not metal.9 <br />11. Higher Than Hope- Written by Marco, I was completely impressed, until I found out that Tuomas helped too. MArco did do most of it though. I have nothing agaisnt either of them, in case it sounded like I did. I love them both.10 <br />12. White Night Fantasy- Hmm. This one I'm not sure of yet. I like it, but I'm going to have to listen to it more. 8 <br />13.Live to Tell the Tale- Yep, Awesome. Glad it's on there. 10 <br /> <br />All in all In love this Cd.Musical perfection and it doesn't get any better than this. All of you who do not like them, all I have to tell you is that they are here to stay!!!
B0002OERI0|3.0|As a great Green Day fan of short, to the point, cynical, critical songs this album has many failings. Mainly in the fact that it covers all the points you would like but drags them out into a '70s epic album. Individually most of the songs are superb but run them together into a \\"concept\\" album and you have a cross of the Ramones and Rush. Each good in their own right but not entirely what you would want from Green Day. I would suggest you play the first and last tracks and forget alot of the stuff inbetween.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Yes, commentary, not documentary.  But it's still wildly entertaining, though not quite as amuzing as Bowling for Columbine.  If you've read \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\", then you will have a good idea of the content of Fahrenheit 911.  However, don't overlook the special features:  Condolezza's testimony before the 911 commision (Ms. Rice, what was the name of the PDB document?  Uh, I believe it was \\"Bin Laden Determined to Attack within The United States\\".---HILARIOUS!).  There is also some very eye-opening footage of Iraq before the war (looks a lot less like a hellhole than George would have us believe).  And don't miss \\"W\\" addressing the media after he and Cheney talked to the 911 commission (\\"I'm glad I took the time.\\"  WHAT?).    The thing, though, about this movie, is that you have to view it as entertainment.  Mr. Moore's points are not all valid, but you have to admit the guy's opinions are very thought-provoking.    For a great companion piece to this film, check out the documentary \\"Outfoxed\\".  The hypocrisy and lies of the Bush regime in 911 is hilariously well-matched by Rupert Murdoch's hypocrisy and lies, supporting this administration and their invasion of Iraq in \\"Outfoxed\\".
1401301010|3.0|I have always been in great awe of Anthony Kiedis's visably articulate and introspective side. His lyrics, press comments, interviews and the exceptionally well done \\"VH1 Behind the Music\\" clearly reveal that Anthony has a high degree of intelligence...  <br /> <br />With that said, his book is a bit disappointing. At times it reads like a \\"Rock N Roll Laundry List\\". I knew the book would be heavily descriptive of his drug use because it is clearly a major part of whom he is. What grew stale in my opinion were the petty grudges and little personal \\"stabs\\" that he takes at everyone ranging from bandmembers to producers to landlords to ex-girlfriends parents to club owners to crazed fans to unfashionable drummers... It almost seems that he is writing with spite. I thought Anthony was above this. <br /> <br />Somewhere within this brick of a book Anthony quietly whispers a spiritual thought about his native Los Angeles being stocked with guiding spirits watching over him. YES! This IS what I wanted to read about! This IS the side of Anthony that is sensitive and spiritual and admirable and brave! This IS the part of Anthony that is inspirational and real. This is the mature, wiser for the wear, soul speaking out! This is their MUSIC! Keep it going, please! <br /> <br />...but then it's back to the girlfriends and grudges.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|It was inevitable that the Matrix Reloaded was not going to live up very well to fan expectations.  And how could it?  The astranomical hype surrounding the movie before its release virtually garanteed that a lot of people were going to be disappointed.  I saw the movie on DVD about a year after it came out.  I was curious to see it, and I pretty much ignored the hype and got to see the movie with a clean slate.   <br /> <br />After my first viewing, My general feelings were, \\"Wow, that was a great action movie, but there were a few problems\\".  I'll go into specific detal why I thought this movie was good by examening common fan complaints <br /> <br />1.  The Zion dance scene:  OK, this scene is absaloutly pointless, aside from being able to see nipples through clear wet shirts.  It was too long, added nothing to the plot and was pointless. <br /> <br />2.  Too much dialoge:  Well, to explain the plot well, you need a lot of dialoge.  And we need breaks from the action as well.  As hard as it may seem, non-stop action scenes can be a bad thing.  Dialoge adds a lot of plot and charachter development to a movie.  Here, we learn that the Oracle really likes candy, and that she is a program.  We learn that Neo has been flying a lot by listening to Link's dialog.  Watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Some of the best scenes are nothing more then two charachters talking to each other.  Example:  Gandalf and Pippin in Minas Tirith in the third movie, talking about death.   <br /> <br />3.  The architechts insane dialoge:  The first time you hear it, the dialoge is confusing and strange.  But the architect is a program.  He rarely, if ever, deals with huamans, so he uses machine talk, so to speak.  But if you watch it several times, the dialoge makes sense and seems natural (for a machine). <br /> <br />4.  Neo's Psychic powers:  Finding out that Neo can stop machines using only his mind is a really interesting plot twists that open a lot of possibilities.  How is this possible...unless...holy crud, a matrix within a matrix!  Or it could be something else.  The movie leaves the slate blank so you can come up with your own conclusion.  Good idea in my opinion. <br /> <br />5.  The Kid:  The kid has been riddiculed a lot, but I think he is a fine side charachter.  He is simply a fan of Neo, and he shows it.  What's wrong with that?  I'm sure you've been obsessed with somebody at one time in your life.   <br /> <br />What I didint like: <br /> <br />Everything involving the Merovingian:  I hate this charachter with a passion.  I think he's unbelivably annoying.  He probably chose the French language just to be annoying to everybody around him.  No wonder Pershonaphe hates him. <br /> <br />The crisis:  the crisis of the movie, \\"Zion is going to be destroyed and we need to do something about it\\" is only vaugly stated in the beginning.  The introduction of the crisis needs to be more solid, rather then just saying, \\"The machines are digging,\\" and hoping the viewer has played Enter the Matrix. <br /> <br />What I really liked: <br /> <br />Morpheus as an action hero:  Seeing Morpheus wield a sword and a gun at the same time while dressed in a snazzy outfit is amazing to watch.  I think Morpheus has his best moments in the trilogy here. <br /> <br />The freeway chase scene:  What's not to like about this scene.  It's cool, and the agent battle on the Semi is just as good as the Neo subway fight in the first movie  <br /> <br />The burly brawl:  Even if some of the effects are a bit off, it's a damn fun scene to watch.  Lots of fighting and awesome camera moves really sell the scene for me.  <br /> <br />Remember that hype is an evil thing.  It will give you unrealistically high expectations that are all but impossible to meet.  Try to watch the movie while just ignoring how dissapointed you were with it. <br /> <br />Maybe I've helped you to change your opinion just a little bit about the movie.  But at least think about it.  I've found that as time goes on, the movie ages well and the plot becomes more clear and easy to understand
B0006213WG|4.0|In my opinion, Sum 41 has gone Emo'ish.  I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, it's just that they've seem to have gone with the crowd, and right now the music craze is - emo.  They have more light-emo style songs.  Their first album was meant to be rock, but some people thought of it as punk.    Over all, I think that this is a good album, although I wish they stuck to their original style (from the first album).    People say that they're more metal now... I can see how they think this, but IN MY OPINION (I don't really care what other reviewers think), they have turned more EMO than metal.    -PeAcE OuT-
B00005JMEW|5.0|Crafted with nostalgia, based on erudite retro touches, I admired the effects of what is a fantastic action film with class. Detractors aside, no one produces movies with this amount of style dripping from every frame. If they had enough cash to spare on making their own, they'd truly come up short of imagination. I LOVE this film
B00003CX9E|5.0|It doesn't take long to realize that even the best movies have their detractors.  When \\"Citizen Kane\\" topped the list of the 100 best American movies of all time, there were a few critics of a choice that many felt did not appeal to the majority of American movie-goers.  Fair enough although \\"Citizen Kane\\" certainly has a story that is a lot easier to follow and enjoy that most of the \\"artistic\\" movies of the last century. It does seem to slow down at times but this is one of those movies that reveals more and more about itself each time you view it.   <br /> <br />It is as though the puzzle of the movie is also a puzzle for the movie audience.  What did Kane mean by the dying word, \\"Rosebud\\"?  Well, everyone who saw it through to the end certainly got a big clue but did that really tell everything there is or was it just a big hint to the larger story hidden in the movie itself?  As we watch the reporter trying to find the answers, we can see inside the story to the many insights hidden throughout the film.  Every time we see it again, the picture becomes clearer.  It isn't just that Kane wanted his childhood back; in many ways he was reliving his childhood as an adult with bigger toys but just as much enthusiasm.  It isn't just that he wanted love that was real; it was clear that he was unable to handle the love he received.  It is a far more complex picture that we have before us than most of us comprehend the first time or two through the reels.  Perhaps it is best to leave it at its' simpler messages but that is to miss the appreciation for the intentional complexity given it by its' creator, Orson Welles.   <br /> <br />There are many examples beyond just the story itself as to why \\"Citizen Kane\\" is such a classic; the camera angles and perspectives, to name one.  However, as much as I appreciate the cinematic innovations, I am fascinated by the story and the many insights to life itself that are revealed in this classic.  This is not necessarily a movie I stop at if I come across it while changing channels.  Sometimes I'm just not up for it, preferring, instead, something lighter for my tired mind.  However, when I want to appreciate just how well all the elements of a great movies can come together in near perfection, I chose to watch \\"Citizen Kane\\".  It may have a few faults (such as who the heck was there to have heard him utter the work \\"Rosebud\\"?).  However, the faults are almost embarassing to mention compared with the magnitude of its' achievements.  This is a movie everyone should see at least twice.

B00064MW6A|1.0|If, like me, you think movies should all be about substance, and not style, then do yourself a favour and ignore the crap expressed from the two fanboys below me, this movie, filled with contradictions to the Catwoman character, from race to origins, sucks. <br /> <br />Berry's acting is petty to say the least, every line she utters has the clear crisp sense of phoning-it-in for the money around it, her more passionate scenes fall flatter than the late Christopher Reeve's wheelchair tires, and the director takes the film's action sequences through an MTV-style aerobatics festival that should please any mindless EMO music video marks. <br /> <br />Don't be a shmuck, don't be a fanboy for this overated actoress, don't waste your money, and hey, thank me for saving your life, because after watching this film, suicide will be an option
B00005JLPK|5.0|Artist Frida Kahlo's paintings are a visual diary of her life--as a revolutionary, as the wife of Diego Rivera, and as a woman in constant pain.  Injured in a bus accident as a young woman, she endured over thirty surgeries, unremitting physical agony, and injuries which left her unable to bear a child, but she also endured the pain of a notoriously unfaithful husband.  As she once told him, \\"There were two big accidents in my life.  You are the worst.\\"<br /><br />Salma Hayek, as Frida, is both tough and vulnerable, showing Frida's spontaneous, physical approach to life and her passionate dedication--to Diego, to her hard-edged paintings, and to communist philosophy.  Alfred Molina, as Diego, a man who \\"belongs only to himself,\\" is warm, funny, often protective, and utterly impossible as a husband.  An established muralist with many commissions when he first meets her, he encourages her artistic goals, explaining, \\"I paint what I see--the world outside.  You paint from your heart.\\"  Married, divorced, and later remarried, Frida and Diego, as we see them here, are both mutually supportive and mutually destructive.<br /><br />Hayden Herrera's biography of Frida is the basis for the Clancy Sigal and Diane Lake screenplay, which emphasizes Frida's pain and her ways of dealing with it--through drink, her work, and through sex, with both women and men, including Leon Trotsky, in exile in Mexico.  The settings from the 1920s and 1930s are brilliantly colorful--a bright blue house with a garden of peacocks, monkeys, and colored birds;  the worksites of Rivera's passionate and brightly colored murals;  and locations in Mexico City and New York.  Lively Mexican music plays throughout, with new music (Elliot Goldenthall) inserted to unify scenes, the piano music being especially memorable.  The cinematography (Roderigo Prieto) takes full advantage of the architecture and the color, which is enhanced by the vibrant clothing, jewelry, and hair adornments worn by Frida.<br /><br />Director Julie Taymor features many of Frida's paintings, and some of Diego Rivera's murals throughout, using them to connect the artists' inner and outer worlds.  On several occasions, however, there are jarring intrusions of cartoons and nightmares--people walk through a photograph, which shifts to black and white;  King Kong in a film morphs into Diego Rivera;  a trip to New York becomes a walk through travel brochures.  Unfortunately, the style of these vignettes is so unexpected and foreign to the tone of this film that they feel intrusive, even arch.  Hayek and Molina are outstanding in conveying the torment of Frida and Diego Rivera, however, and the film, overall, is a fascinating study of two artists living through the tumult of history and each other.

B00064MW6K|1.0|Pay no attention to Kids Review...he's a known troll on this site and he does'nt have an objective bone in his body. <br /> <br />90% of Catwoman's action sequences were filmed with a STUNTMAN IN HALLIE'S COUSTUME, I hope you were'nt doing anything...playful as you drooled over \\"Hallie\\" when THAT happened. <br /> <br />As for the film itself...for drooling Hallie Berry fans everywhere to enjoy...not to mention the shmuck popcorn fans who don't really care for quality in superhero movies, just the size of the special effects and the T&A, your negative ratings of my opinion will reflect that quite admirably...and I will laugh. <br /> <br />Let's hope the commentary on the DVD is the apology
B00005B36H|4.0|This review is in response to Christopher's review.  I do believe you need to take another look at your review there Chris.  Lay off of the drama.  Although Maynard may have dark undertones in his lyrics, most of them are either filled with humor or some other underlying motive.  Yeah, so the guitarist can't play anything beautiful, who said metal had to be beautiful?  I feel that the drummer is exceptional, and has a unique style of drumming.  Where else have you heard drumming that original?  Oh yeah, Maynard's voice.  Completely extraordinary.  I saw the guy live, and I was awestruck by his voice.  The timing, yes I forgot the timing.  It is unique yes, who wants to listen to the same thing over and over again?  Not me, have you ever heard Flogging Molly?  I can't recall any of their song titles because they all sound the same.  Exact drums in each song.  That uniquity is what makes people love this band, and I'm glad I've had the privilege to listen to their music.  Here's another point...they have made more money than you or I will ever make in a lifetime, doesn't that mean they are successful?
B000002L1L|5.0|If you read Ian's book or listen to critics, you'll have an opinion on this cd before you ever touch it.<br /><br />Myself, I saw this in the store. It has no inclination on it as to who is on it.<br /><br />So I bought it, lol.<br /><br />KICK'S MAJOR BUTT FROM FRONT TO BACK!!<br /><br />I'll make this fast and easy. I really have been a fan since 1969. There is not a bad Deep Purple lp/cd ever made. They are one of the top 5 bands that can really jam.<br /><br />In a way their worst is still better then most others best.<br /><br />So what it was going to be a Joe Lynn Turner cd. But he didn't last and Ian came in after the music was recorded. (Might I add Slaves & Masters is the best Rainbow cd ever, if you think about it.)<br /><br />This is Blackmore's last cd with the band. And Ian's first cd where he has become the permanent front man for all time. Any one who wants to make a bigger deal out of Blackmore & Gillans war then the music? Go ahead, the rest of us want to rock and/or roll. And The Battle Rages on is the way we like it. So in good old spirit, lets just have everything louder then everything else. No need to do a track-by-track review. Just crank it up, okay?<br /><br />Ramshackle Man does lean real close to Stevie Wonders Higher Ground, lol.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I'll save the summary for everyone else who's already done it.  This is a documentary that could have kept going, and I wouldn't have cared.  I felt like crying a few times. I felt anger. <br /> <br />And rarest of all, I felt interest for a time period that is neither my primary field, nor country.  I'm a pre-19th century European historian, not 20th century American.  That's a first. <br /> <br />I'm also not a war fan, don't like war movies, am not good with dates and battles and strategies... but this documentary pulled me in. <br /> <br />Don't expect the reading of a standard history book, nor a glowing report of our leaders through the World Wars and Vietnam, because you won't get one. <br /> <br />Don't expect to see footage of protestors with their flower power or sappy, lingering tributes to fallen soldiers and leaders (such as JFK). <br /> <br />Do expect to see eleven lessons flashed up on the screen throughout the documentary, and be prepared to be startled over one of them, at least. <br /> <br />Do expect to see a former Secretary of State, in a thoroughly lucid and entertaining state at age 85, talking about events some of us grew up with, or had parents who wouldn't talk about because they were desperately trying to forget. <br /> <br />As much as I enjoy Michael Moore, skip him over and get this first.  It may not be about our current events, but these events created the nation we live in today.  That's vital.
B000075BFK|5.0|This is a great cd that shows off the late 2Pac's lyrics.  2Pac always has a strong message, too.  There really isn't any songs that I really don't like and skip over on either cd.

B0000028UK|4.0|If you are new to the band Pearl jam, get this album. If you have another album and liked it, get this album. If you hear them on the radio and you don't like them, get it anyways. This album covers the entire spectrum. Both Stone Gossard and Eddie are at there best on this album. The rockers on this album, \\"Don't go\\" \\"animal\\" and \\"blood\\" are among the band's best and hardest. The ballad's aren't the best, except for \\"Elderly woman...\\" and of course \\"daughter\\" but the album doesn't suffer because of this. My personal favorites on this album are \\"rearviewmirror\\", \\"blood,\\" and \\"glorified G\\"
B00013RC9I|5.0|I've been an Air fan since I watched the `Sexy Boy' video on television in January 1998 and from then on have been a big fan and just thinking that they are the greatest band in the world, and having seen them live twice I think their interpretation of their songs live are excellent. Their music is beautiful, everything about it is wonderful in its simplicity of `Ce Matin La' to the constructed `Surfing on a rocket', their music to me is perfect and harmonious. With their third official album (their seventh L.P if you count the soundtrack, remix, early singles and collaboration album that has kept them occupied) `Talkie Walkie' is again nothing but brilliance from Air. From the identifiable costal lost vocals and the combination of electronic and acoustic it shows that they are continuously building on what they have learned and progress. The tracks are all different and they create images and feelings that make things astronomically cool, from making you want to see if you can fly, dance in a break beat style to making you want things to move in bullet time.  <br /> <br />My favorite songs on this record are `Run', `Biological', `Another Day' and `Surfing on a rocket'. Starting with `Biological' a song that rules to begin with because of the use of a banjo. The song would be cool in a western or if you are driving like a manic in lightning weather, the way the pulses of electronic move along in rhyme make this song to be like a mountain climber who when about to reach the top falls and the songs kicks in with its little clicks and is like the climber is having flashbacks to what has happened in their life. `Another Day' and its industrial sounds and mechanisms make this slow burn track into a song of meaning and how time is wasted. `Surfing on a rocket' is one to superfunk to. It's beats and rhythms make it a track that makes you dance undestructive to. Another track I forgot to mention above is `Alone in Kyoto' which was the first new Air material I was able to purchase via the Lost in Translation soundtrack and this record is all about instrumentation and sounds and reverberations. Its pounding time is running out sounds make it a head banger and toe tapping song. The sound of the guitar with the electronic is just cool. The final song which I hale to be one of the best songs ever is `Run' the whole track is just amazing, it is just a song, but it evokes images of motion that's depicted to be beauty (I'm not making myself sound with sense). The echo and the continuous repeating the lyrics and the constant adding of sounds make this a track that is fundamentally a true description of music that inspires and moves you.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Please, as a true Gn'R fan, I plead with other Gn'R fans not to buy this album for the simple reason I would ask people not to buy the Aerosmith Greatest hits (the first one with the editted version of \\"Sweet Emotion\\"), because the band has NOTHING TO DO WITH IT!!!  In a strange way this album brought together the original members of Gn'R and they collaborated on something, as well: a lawsuit to try and keep this best of from being released.  Yes, they are probably getting (a lot) of money for this, but this has nothing to do with the band.  This is a ploy by the record company to milk this cash cow to the bitter end.  Now, some might say \\"hey, wouldn't this help turn on some new fans to this band?\\"  And I would slap them and say \\"No.\\", and they would cry.  'Appetite' is where to go.  You don't need a best of.  For any people thinking of trying out Gn'R, go there.  For any true Gn'R fan who might want to get this to get a collection of Gn'R music, you can't save up and buy 3 albums?  Hell, just get 'appetite' and 'uyi I' and you've got most of the best.  Really, it's not worth the money to get this, it's just a marketing ploy. <br /> <br />Really, if you're a big Gn'R fan, you don't need this.  It's not like it's Aerosmith here, they only have 4 albums out with original material, a covers album (don't bother with it, though), and a live album.  Not that much.  and for anyone interrested with trying out Gn'R, listen to 'Appetite', if you don't like it, that's pretty much their best of right there.
B0002VKZL6|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits since the late 1970's and this, in my opinion, is perhaps the worst thing he has ever put out.  The entire cd (with the exception of \\"Boom, Like That\\") is mellow to the point of it being boring, with no sign of Knopfler's signature guitar work. I bought this cd based on the Amazon review that said this was Knopfler's \\"most rocking album since his days in Dire Straits\\". What were they listening to? This is untrue and misleading. I would give anything for new material that even comes close to songs such as \\"Telegraph Road\\", \\"Tunnel Of Love\\", or even \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\".  Maybe Knopfler is just getting to old to really rock anymore.
B000002JR8|5.0|Pantera are the kings of modern metal and they'll remain the best ones at it. I always have been into pantera and they realy haven't let me down, once. A true metal classic with original and great riffs, Phil's deep lirycs, and, just plain brutal modern metal nonstop.I recommend!
B0006213WG|4.0|Well I just purchased the Sum 41 a few days a go , and I find it very different from there other two.They incorporate a few differnt sounds into this album , the other two are more of a punk based sound mixed with a bit of harder rock. This has a few songs that are slower and seem to mean something a bit more to the band.It might be the fact that when they where in congo , they had a close call.Sum 41 is one of my favorite bands and I am in no way disappointed in this album &quot;Chuck&quot;.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|With the radio hit \\" Time is Running Out\\" Muse proves yet again how original they are. They have created a genre of there own, borderlining between rock and an almost orchastra/ electronica type sound. Absolution contains mainly lyrics centering around the disoray of the world, with songs such as <br />Apolocolypse Please <br />( Declare this an emergency, go on and sell a sense of urgency....) <br />Hysteria <br />( Cuz I wantt it now, I want it now, give me your heart and your soul..) <br />I could ( and have) listened to this c.d for hours, I would highly recomend it, espesially to fans of Queen, or Radiohead.
B00005JKHP|5.0|This new Director's Cut claims to embody director Robert Wise's original vision for this film, and I believe it holds true to that claim. Every version of this film is excellent, but the quality possessed by this particular DVD version is the most impressive. The special features contained on disc two of this set are also worth looking in to. <br />BOTTOM LINE: The price is right for this stunning flashback to the late '70's. Also, if you own other versions, hang on to them, they're cool, too.
0071373586|5.0|Great book. Written in a highly readable manner. Unmatched guide into positioning - And, as the authors define it(positioning) - a battle for your customer's mind...
B00005JMAH|5.0|\\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the most magical of the three Harry Potter movies to date. The special effects have far surpassed my ability to guess how they are done. (The scene with the protean Boggart, a-swirl with phenomenal computer graphics, apparently, is fascinating as spectacle and translates perfectly from the book.<br /><br />The level of acting is the best yet. Daniel Radcliffe positively seethes as the adolescent Harry. Michael Gambon does a passable imitation of the late Richard Harris doing Dumbledore. Emma Thompson is suitably daft and daffy as counterculture throwback Professor Sybil Trelawaney. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Herminone Granger) are more than passable as Harry's boon friends and confidants.<br /><br />The look of Hogwarts is perfect -- a masterful translation of the book to film, not a slavish reproduction. The Whomping Willow is frighteningly menacing. Clockworks are on prominent display, echoing the book's time-travel theme. Creatures (especially the winged hippogriff) are rendered so subtly and perfectly that it's hard to believe you are watching the whirl of colored pixels rather than a real beast. A critical time-based plot twist is expertly handled and may provide your family with hours of discussion and argument. It did mine.<br /><br />\\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is the perfect gift for the little witch or wizard in your family. Perfect for every Potter fan 8 and older.
B00005JNJ7|1.0|Just stick to doing Southpark! Of your three movies the only one worth seeing is the Southpark: Bigger, Longer and Uncut. Don't waste your time seeing this one. I saw it free and it still wasn't worth the price.
B00005JMAH|5.0|First things first, and it must be said: do not, do not, DO NOT go in expecting a word-by-word lifting of the book, verbatim, from page to screen. Director Alfonso Cuaron was not afraid to slice and dice parts from the book in order to deliver this film. And you know what? Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is better for it. <br /> <br />One of the delights, for me, in going back and re-reading the Harry Potter series now that the movies have come out is that the action in the book plays itself out in my head with the actors, sets and scenes from the movies. And what you come to realize in the course of this memory-movie is that some things simply cannot be as effective on celluloid as they are in print. Entire pages of the book are worthless to a film director, for various reasons. Cuaron understands this. J.K. Rowling herself has admitted this. <br /> <br />Chris Columbus, who directed the first two, tried to simply transpose every scene from the book. And instead of good MOVIES, all we ended up with were cartoonish, choppy monstrosities consisting only of scene after scene interposed pretty randomly with each other. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie so much as a series of short sketches and vignettes about life at Hogwarts. <br /> <br />What made Azkaban so phenomenal, in my mind, was Cuaron's deft directing as a result of his willingness to sacrifice some book in the name of a great movie. J.K. Rowling wrote novels, not screenplays, and to try and make apple pie from oranges would just be (as \\"Sorceror's Stone\\" and \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" proved) clunky and disastrous. <br /> <br />Now, as for the film itself, this is a fine piece of CINEMA from a gifted and exceptional director. He works with these kids in a way that Chris Columbus never did. He draws nuanced, subtle performances from all of them, making me believe these kids might have a future as actors AFTER this series. The range of emotion that Daniel Radcliffe explores in his role as Harry in this film is raw and powerful. For the first time in the cinematic version, we can believe that he truly feels pain over the loss of his parents, pain at the relatively lonely world he moves in. We can see it in his bond with Professor Lupin (played by a delightful Daniel Thewlis), a fatherly male role model who knew Harry's parents. The scene where Lupin and Harry are strolling on a bridge talking, and Thewlis starts to reminisce about Harry's parents, is astonishing. Look at the way Radcliffe plays the scene - the taut, tight storm of emotions flickering across his face. He cannot bear the pain of hearing about his parents, people he will never know...and yet he cannot stop his professor, because this is the only way he ever WILL know them. It is breathtaking acting on Radcliffe's part, and I applaud him for it. <br /> <br />The film looks simply gorgeous. I thought the first two movies were trying to be live-action cartoons: too bright, too garish, too Technicolor and candy-coated. In this film, things are much more realistic: it isn't afraid to go dark, and it's the better for it. The camera in the hands of Alfonso Cuaron is practically an actor in its own right. Shots pan and swoop, drawing back to take in a scene while the production design leaves a single element to glowby virtue of its solitude: the scene where the train stops and the camera pulls in on Ron's hand, the only light in an otherwise dark frame, is a fine example. <br /> <br />The use of time in this film as a thematic element is clever and marginally subtle. Shots pan and dive through the workings of a giant clock, a massive pendulum swings dangerously and incessantly in the background. It's Cuaron's way of showing not only that these kids are rapidly becoming adults, but also overshadows the element of death that this movie deals much more closely with than the first two did. <br /> <br />All in all, I could not be more pleased with this film. I can't understand the critics who say, leave the books be! If they are that much a fan of the novels (as I am), but can't understand that good books do not good movies make, then they shouldn't bother watching the films anyway. My hat's off to Cuaron and Co.: may he come back and direct another Potter movie in the future!
0783226063|5.0|I have the All the Dune movies & etc., but I would love to be able to get the orginal Dune in the longer version on DVD.  I have recorded the longer version off of TV when it was aired, but love to be able to buy it on DVD in it's entirety, not the shorter version that you can get on DVD, but the longer version that is about 4 hours or so in lenght.  Also I love the wide screen versions of movies.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This was a very painful film to watch because of the bubble that was burst by it.  I always believed my government was always right.  Always upholding truth and honor.  The good against the bad. But now I see a government can be only pure and truthful as the men and women we elect to represent us.  Our politicians both Democrat and Republican are out of touch with Americans.  Both have speeches that play on both sides of our emotion in order to get us to support their greed.  This film replaces the missing media that this country needed during a time of pain and loss.  The media was complacent and allowed the truth to be surpressed and the opposing views to be smothered in the name of greed and appeasement.  Mr. Moore's film gives what real reportive journalism is like and allows us, the people, to decide what we wish to believe or not.  Not the spinmeisters or news talking heads that represent their corporate media bosses.  Thanks Mr. Moore and keep up the tough reporting.
B000063JDE|5.0|Roger Ebert is one of the greatest movie critics we have today (far superior to Leonard Maltin in every regard). Having said that I would like to disagree with his review of David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet'(a film which evokes some of Ebert's favorite film noirs as well as a sort of detatched German expressionest feel - familiar to those who have seen the films of film-makers like Herzog. One thing I really like is the deliberate symbolic nature of the movie (it almost is a parady of itself at times - the darkness underneath all things - the ants that are crawling beneath the soil. I also like Lynch's choice of actors the naive Laura Dern and Kyle Michlouglin and how they are drawn to the dark sides of things - which encompass both the likes of the Isabella Rosellini character (who also is kind of innocent in a twisted way) and Frank (Dennis Hopper) the very depiction of evil.<br /><br />Though I can identify with Ebert just not liking the film (I detest everything Tarantino has done) - I personally find this film to be very meaningful - and in a way funny.<br /><br />Lynch is possibly the only American film maker (right now) that I truly admire - he completely opens himself up in his films - truly uncompromising.
B00004TH83|5.0|I understand that the word \\"diva\\" in Latin originally meant goddess, and came to refer to female singers who could capture huge audiences, stadiums even, usually with very powerful voices and larger-than-life personae.    Well Lara Fabian is often compared to those traditionally thought of as divas, the likes of Celine Dion, Mariah Carey and (to me, the largest-than-life of them all) Whitney Houston. The similarities are obvious, such as the big voice, the tremendous feminine strength combined with sensitivity.    However I find there is something incredibly different and unique about Lara Fabian, so much that I feel she should always be thought of and admired in her own right. Her persona is very down-to-earth for a diva. It never overshadows her singing, her art and her heart. I really feel her emotions from deep within, very pure, genuine and stirring. Every note is for real, never exaggerated for the sake of vocal gymnastics. Because of these, ironically, she is not likely to ever get the massive fan base that Mariah, Celine or Whitney have. So she is something of a diva for a niche.    Some critics may say her songs are platitudes, but for the diehard romantics among us - those who usually like our love songs relatively simple and uncomplicated - Lara will bring back to you the strongest, purest visions of love found/lost you ever had, without ever being naive or saccharine.    The classy, pulsating dance number \\"I Will Love Again\\" may seem cliched, lyrics-wise (\\"I will love again/though my heart is breaking I will love again\\"), but she makes the song so much her own, her delivery so strong & true, that it shakes away the cynicism from me and recaptures the purity of defiance and hope.    2 other favourite tracks for me are \\"Love by Grace\\" and \\"You're Not from Here\\". The 2 songs are reminiscent of those rainy evenings with the luminescence of streetlights shimmering in puddles, and those bittersweet meetings of lovers on the edge:    \\"Didn't come here to leaveyou/didn't come here to lose/I didn't come here believing/I would ever be away from you/I didn't come here to find out/there's a weakness in my faith\\" (Love by Grace)    \\"I know you/you're not from here/You don't belong to lies and tears/The greatness of your soul/Makes me weep... just one touch of yours/ And I fly... and I fly\\" (Not from Here)    Just listen to Lara's voice go when she sings the word \\"fly\\". My word, it REALLY Soars. And it's a very natural soaring.. no strain in her voice whatsoever.. it just takes flight with the feelings of the song and the singer.    More shades of love and longing are found in \\"Adagio\\", a stirring piece vocally. Philosophically, \\"Yeliel (My Angel)\\" is impressive even in its forthright simplicity. \\"Why do I love/Why do I hate and die?\\"    Lara is truly a diva who reaches out to the people, as she shows in her album notes: \\"TO MY FANS / The discovery of music through you has been my true happiness and evolution. I hope that every second of this music will explain how much I care for you.\\" I believe the greatest artists are those who really reach out, to Connect with individuals even in a crowd. So if it feels right, why not open your heart to her?
068987474X|5.0|I have just read the book and have found the advice very helpful. As the book says..every women should have this book on their nightstand!!!! Not only is the book for women but men can relate to it as well. Good Job in writing such a wonderful interpretation into guys (and some womens) excuses!!!!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|I HATE when people dislike music just because it's mainstream and they liked the band before it was on MTV and TRL.  Franz Ferdinand is one of those bands and I'm thankful they were on TV or else I probably would have never heard of them.  If you're a fan you should be happy a good band has made it big.  Like a lot of people I bought this CD because I heard their hit single \\"Take Me Out\\" but when I listened to the CD I was surprised to find that, even though \\"Take Me Out\\" is a great song, there were so many that were even better!  But this CD, it really is worth it!
B0002VC924|5.0|Is it just me or do the American people not see thier President for who he really is? Everything he has touched, business wise, has failed, and everyone he associates with is a terrorist or a future terrorist.  Moore hit the nail on the head with this one and nobody can dispute the well documented facts in this film....WELL DONE MR MOORE!!
B0002IQHZM|4.0|This is a great Donovan album. After a few lsitens it will envelope you. This album is... smooth, cool and musically visual. Excellent production also. His voice is absolutely perfect and sounds exactly like it did in 1966. This songs are very well writen and simple. It's like taking a time machine at some points. Seems like he's realized that he can sound like he did in the 60's and still be who he is today. A hard thing to do with any artist but he really pulls it off here. Will we be listening to this in in 2034? I'm sure I will be. Lay your head back and let the master of cosmic music take you \\"there\\". You will not regret it. An album that will be with you through the years.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I like Wilco a lot.  They're talented and innovative, and they explore uncharted areas, a huge plus in this era of homogenized, formulaic bland music.  YHF has really good songs, but there are squawky effects aplenty that have been added, it seems gratuitously, to the music.  As always, I copied the CD onto my hard disc, from where all my records are played.  That gives me (and you) the chance to keep what you like and cut the rest.  I use Adobe Audition, an excellent and affordable editing program, to trim up my records. <br /> <br />The first track has a lot of heartfelt music in it, but also a lot of noisy and droning filler.  I took out those parts and got it down from 7 minutes to 3:20 minutes, and now it feels really tightened up, a compelling cut.  Kamera is great on its own.  Radio Cure, um, I just didn't like at all, so I left it off.  The next few tracks are terrific, no tweaks needed, great music.  Poor Places gets awfully squawky at the end, but trim about 1:30 and do a fadeout and you've got a really nice track.  The last track, Reservations, is a beautiful song followed by about 3 minutes of synthesizer doodles that, I'm sorry, are pretty lame.  Cut the doodles and you've got a wonderful track.   <br /> <br />Overall a super album.  I like it a great deal and I'm glad I bought it.  Some of you may enjoy the squawky bits; for those who don't, take advantage of the power of your computer and make this terrific record suit your taste.
B000002C2E|5.0|OK  Pe-OPLE, so I dont own this one...YEt, I did spend time listening to the samples and my impression is that this music sounds like REGGIE music.  The kind of thing you put on, invite some friends drink some drinks with pineapple and little umbrellas in em and have a party.  Put on shades and strut around in you Hawaiian shirt.<br /><br />Also, if you like Reggie music, listen to Jacob Marley.
0312263120|4.0|this was a great book..especially considering it's brown's first...lots of plot twists and real intrigue abound in this one...great characters and plenty of action..a real page turner...definetly worth reading!
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|It's going to be a challenge to keep this brief...  <br /> <br />From the first time you pick up the box, you know that Blind Guardian went all out on this, their first DVD release.  It has an attractive sleeve with eye-popping fantasy artwork, a solid plastic case for the 2 DVD's, and a nice 2 page foldout that maps the features on the discs.  I kind of wish there was a more complete tour book with it, but nevertheless, what is provided is very good. <br /> <br />I watched the bonus feature DVD first.  Nice, attractive menues without any lame animations that serve no purpose other than to make you wait and wait to see what you want to see.  Here and there, you will see some cute and unobtrusive graphics thrown in, such as a goblin facing the stage when you start the \\"making of\\" section.  The dialogue is all in German, but subtitles are provided.  It's interesting stuff if you don't know anything about the band, but if you're a die hard Guardian fanatic, you won't learn anything new.  The live performances on the bonus DVD are stellar. <br /> <br />Now... the main feature, DVD 1, the concert.  This is where my 100% Quality and Attention to Detail comment comes in to play.  Masterful!  The sound is crisp and clear, the camera work is beautiful, and the color and clarity jumps off the screen.  The exciting festival atmosphere is brought fully to life on this disc.  For those of you familiar with Blind Guardian, Hansi, as a lead singer, is not a very energetic showman... he pretty much stands and sings.  However, his voice is flawless, and the enthusiasm of the band and especially the crowd MORE than makes up for that fact.  Hansi's wry smiles and sometimes goofy facial expressions can be appreciated by any fan, anyway. <br /> <br />Much attention is given to making sure the listener hears everything clearly.  On this DVD, you don't get any of those concert sound dropouts.  While that is a great thing, major music enthusiasts will probably notice several sudden and dramatic changes in acoustic levels to get the desired effects.  If you like this band, however, it won't bother you.  When it's time for an awesome solo, the guitars are cranked up.  In key vocal moments, Hansi's mic is very loud.  During the classic Bard's Song, the audience will just blow you away... it's no wonder that the theater audience stood for this song in Germany when this DVD was played for the first time on the silver screen. <br /> <br />Over all... LOVE it.  I'll be watching this one again and again.  Blind Guardian's Imaginations Through the Looking Glass easily rivals the grandeur of the likes of Iron Maiden, and for those that know me, that's QUITE a declaration.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|It's not just amazing hooks and intensity, though it is that.  It's one of the most sincere musical statements I've ever heard.  This record is in the process of changing my life.  I'll let you know how it goes.
B00020HEG6|5.0|i like the music it was good  <br />to see the movie  <br />by john williams
B000002IG4|5.0|I remember listening to this album as a young boy and playing it so hard that my tape broke. I just got the CD and the baby seems to really like it. 'Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart' is a classic song right up there with Billy Joel's 'Piano Man' and Elton John's 'Your Song'. This album deserves a second listen. I am so happy I ordered the CD last month.
0345457684|4.0|Here we have a wild and woolly detective yarn spliced into a bizarre cyberpunk future. Richard Morgan has come up with a great gimmick with the shifting technological aspects of human life that he explores within. Here, a person's mind and consciousness can be downloaded into a storage device (stack) and removed from and inserted into different bodies (sleeves). A person can die many times while wearing many sleeves of different races, body types, and even genders. The downtime between sleeves is spent in a virtual reality realm where time is dilated, and which can be constructed as a relaxing paradise or sanity-destroying torture based on who's doing the programming. And of course, these miraculous new technologies have swiftly come under the brutal manipulation of organized crime and the wealthy. How this all affects life and death, as well as what it means to be human, leads to some fascinating insights from Morgan.<br /><br />However, the meat of this novel revolves around a detective story that is not very focused and gets quite out of hand as it goes along. The detective Kovacs is a very inconsistent lead character, regardless of what body he's wearing, as he's either got a machine-like zen calm or erupts into uncontrolled rage. The crime he is investigating grows into an enormous conspiracy that keeps getting bigger and bigger, and less and less believable, as the novel rumbles ahead, complete with unnecessarily intertwined motives and endlessly piled-on players in the conspiracy. This book is further held back by a lot of masochistic and gratuitous violence, while much of the future cyberpunk society Morgan constructs is second-rate William Gibson. This is surely an action-packed and intriguing debut novel from Morgan, but some focus is needed with the plot and characterizations. [~doomsdayer520~]
B00009XITQ|5.0|Being a huge fan of Amanda Bynes (I'll admit that I loved The Amanda Show and All That), I knew I had to check out WHAT A GIRL WANTS. I had heard it being compared to The Princess Diaries, which isn't all that far off. It's another cute, girl power movie. <br /> <br />Daphne Reynolds (Amanda Bynes) loves living in her apartment in Chinatown with her mom, but she really wants to know who her dad is. Her mom never really tells her, and Daphne still really, really wants to know him. What she does know, though, is that he lives in England. On her birthday, she uses her money to buy a plane ticket to London and plans to meet her dad. When she first arrives, Daphne is a bit overwhelmed.  <br /> <br />She meets a few friends along the way (Ian Wallace, the musician, is probably the most memorable), and they all tell her that she has to try to make peace with the fact that her dad is getting remarried to a completely horrible woman with an equally bad daughter. Of course, the movie wouldn't be complete without a few of Amanda's token pratfalls, but for once they're actually pretty funny. <br /> <br />WHAT A GIRL WANTS is definately a cute movie, and it has a killer soundtrack. Highly recommended if you liked The Princess Diaries (one and two), A Walk to Remember, or How to Deal. <br /> <br />Overall grade - A+
B0001LJCPC|5.0|there is SO MUCH on this disc that bares greater importance and reverence than malcolm's sweet but boring rendition of the zombie's about her. <br />lole & manuel, whose parents were flamenco giants of the same generation as Paco Pea, bring flare and substance to the soundtrack that keeps you in the movie and in the mood. <br />ennio morricone, who gave us a wide range of soundtrack expertise since 1960s including 2 mules for str sarah, salo, the thing(jc's) and bullworth, has a great track - a silhouette of doom - how fun is THAT title! i can see the scene every time i hear the track. <br />charlie feathers, a grievously underrated rockabilly legend, gets another song in the flick that pulls some more of the \\"western\\" feel to this flick. <br />even chingon, robert rodriquez's band \\"made up of members from the Austin music community, featuring members of the Spanish Rock band, DEL CASTILLO, Carl Thiel, Rafael Gayol of Bob Schneider's band, Cecilio Ruiz from the HeeBeeJeeBee's, and others\\", have an overall impact on the film that other reviewers seem to be leaving out of their review. the \\"feel\\" of the movie relys on the flow and mix of the genres of music. about her is just one song in a great set of trax.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Why did they release these sequels?  They are dumb and just does not add up to the spectacular first MATRIX... I refuse to even watch the other two movies because it will take the fun out of the first movie... i dont even care if the sequels have the best fighting scenes or the best graphics since 3-D... it is not that crucial to see these movies at all... <br /> <br />If you want to see these sequels and love the first one... brace yourself for the worst series since the FRIDAY THE 13th series....
B000002LIX|5.0|I've got to be honest here.  I've been a fan of JA since '92 (I know that I was a little late, but I was only 15 at the time so give me a break) and this was the first album of there's that I heard.  Some mates introduced me to this and I was absolutely blown away.  I know there's been some reviews saying that \\"Been Caught Stealing\\" isn't that great, but I've got to say otherwise, it being the first song that caught my ear.  Same goes for \\"Three Days\\".  I can not get enough of this song, and I've been listening to the CD for over ten years now. <br />  Although a lot of the album has some experimental stuff (which may not appeal to a lot of people), the first half of the album is definitely worth the purchase for the uninitiated (Don't get me wrong. I think the whole album is genius, but it might take a few listens for newcomers to appreciate the songs later in the album).  Seriously, there is some amazing musicianship on this album, not to mention the excellent lyrical work. <br />  In conclusion, this is one of very few CD's that have changed my views on music and life.  You should definitely own it!!
6304806434|5.0|Nicolas Cage is not one of my favourite actor... at all.  He gets the movies that he feels he has to be the hero and i have movies like that.... I dont want anyone to be the hero... I actually like it when a hero takes his or her life by saving someone or somthing (i.e. MAN ON FIRE and THELMA AND LOUISE... LOL) <br /> <br />CON AIR is a brilliant film because of one person...SALLY CAN'T DANCE... if you dont know who i am talkin about watch the movie and you will see...  <br /> <br />The action is entertaining and keeps you on the edge of your seat... Ving Rhames is a brilliant actor.. i just wish he would get better roles like BABY BOY & MISSION IMPOSSIBLE...  <br /> <br />\\"how do i live\\" by trisha yearwood the theme to the movie is great... way better than the leanne rhymes sappy version.... <br /> <br />ohh and for you DAVE CHAPPELLE fans... he is in this movie and funny as a mutha... <br /> <br />if you like non-stop action and humour than get this movie...
B000002NBY|4.0|What more needs to be said about this album?  It's good, enough said.
B00005JM02|5.0|FINDING NEMO is by far the best cartoon movie I have ever seen (next to Shrek 2)... This movie had humour, action, drama, depth, carisma, and ELLEN DEGENERES (this gal here is too funny i did not like her until this movie came out)... I would have never thought a Cartoon movie would ever be this good...  <br /> <br />TO be honest i had my doubts until i went to the theaters to see for myself... i was amazed by the graphics, the characters and the humor...  This movie was funny... I thought Ellen would have been kind of annoying but she stole the show with the whale impression.... im still laughin to date....  <br /> <br />IF you have not seen this movie yet you need to get out of your shell and watch it... you will have to catch your breathe... If you have to watch only one cartoon movie in your lifetime, FINDING NEMO is the one.
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you don't already appreciate what the World War II veterans went through, you will after watching this series.  This is the story of a group of paratroopers who jumped on D-Day and fought their way across Europe.  The stories are great, the action is intense and the acting couldn't be much better.   <br /> <br />The DVD is full of extras, including interviews with the veterans and the actors who portrayed them in the series.  If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, you'll love this one.  I've talked to several people who saw it and haven't talked to anybody yet who didn't love this series. <br /> <br />I was hooked by the end of the first episode.  It starts a little slow, showing the training these guys had to endure before going into battle, but I still enjoyed the first episode quite a bit.  From there it just continued to get better and better.
0375703764|5.0|Three years after reading this book I am still thinking about it. I watch it in my mind as if were a film. (Echoes of Kafka, vestiges of Borges, nods to Poe.) I will keep Navidson's last free-fall in the blackness with me forever.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is a GREAT movie with something for everyone. It will make you laugh and cry. Must have!
B00064MW6A|5.0|Catwoman is a superb movie. The story, similar to that of Spider-Man and Daredevil, is done in a way here that's very refreshing. The movie oozes with style, and a lead character that we can relate to sometimes. Catwoman has good and evil in her, and it's cool to see that. And Halle Berry does a fantastic job in the role.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this movie, from the opening credits that were done very tastefully, to the action scenes (the jewelery store was my personal favorite, exceptional choreography). Sharon Stone is also here, and looks like she's having a blast being the villain. One thing I especially liked about the movie was the musical score. At times it was dramatic, then mixed with hip-hop and rock, but always excellent. I hope this DVD is loaded with special features, as I will be buying it as soon as it comes out.
B00009TB5G|4.0|First, I would like to say the Lord of the Rings trilogy (whether in book form or in film) is not for those suffering from attention deficit disorder.  It is not for those seeking a thrill a minute, who get bored to tears unless they see something blow up or a limb getting sliced off with blood spattering the camera lens every 5 seconds.  It is not for those who get lost whenever a plot has several intertwined storylines.  It is not for those who want climax or resolution where none is appropriate according to the flow of the story. <br /> <br />Neither is the Lord of the Rings epic for those who want to see reality-based movies (regardless, perhaps, of how liberally the reality is distorted), 'futuristic' thrillers, pointless comedies, or movies that are more akin to a thrill ride on a rollercoaster than to reading a good novel (though of course, the Lord of the Rings movies do offer their share of thrills and chills.) <br /> <br />If you are not the type who gets engrossed in a good story to the point of forgetting where you are or how late in the night it is, you probably wouldn't appreciate the Tolkien books or the Jackson movies.  If you never just stopped to gaze in silence for a few minutes at a particularly awesome sunset, or felt elation at listening to a particularly masterful musical performance, then you probably will not appreciate the vibrant, intricate and multifaceted beauty of either the Middle Earth books or the movies.  If you have never shed a tear in a movie theater, then you probably don't have the capacity for a visceral, emotional appreciation of this epic that makes it so worth-while for the fans. <br /> <br />I think the above does an ample job of explaining the bulk of negative reviews you will find here.  <br /> <br />That said, the Two Towers in its theatrical release does have flaws.  Most if not all are mentioned and elaborated in other reviews, so I shall not repeat them here.  I would have given the theatrical release 3 stars -- notbecause I think it's mediocre compared to most other movies, but because I think it could have been that much better. <br /> <br />The Extended Edition adds some vital, crucial scenes.  The Faramir storyline is really fleshed out; the effect is dramatic enough in my opinion to elevate Faramir from a cardboard cutout to a flesh-and-blood being.  The extra scenes with Merry and Pippin in the forest are great; they really show the beauty of that ancient forest that was somehow not noticeable in the theatrical release, but they also help fill out the relationship between the hobbits and Treebeard (the extra scene at Orthank completes this set of enhancements, and I think really adds to the overall story.)  The Aragorn character is better developed, as is his relationship with Eowyn, and we find out that he is not actually an ordinary human (a very important point in the books, yet completely missing from the theatrical edition.)  The scenes with Huorns are a welcome addition.  The extra scene at the start of the movie where Sam gets to use the magical elvish rope gifted to him by Galadriel in the first movie's Extended Edition, is a welcome touch and helps explain why the rope causes such agony to Gollum later in the movie (i.e. it's not an ordinary rope.)  We get to see Gollum badly beaten when captured by Faramir's men, which helps us better understand his turnaround and anger at Frodo, and explains the scars on his back that we can see at the end of the movie in the theatrical edition. <br /> <br />I definitely think the Extended Edition is the movie to have and watch; forget the theatrical release as just a business tactic and a marketing ploy. <br /> <br />However, I stop short of giving the movie 5 stars.  This is due mostly to the battle at Helm's Deep.  Like many people, I was turned off by the corny jokes, flashy moves, and almost frivolous chivalry.  The battle, though gripping it certainly was and visually very impressive, was just not gritty enough.  It didnot impress upon me the grave mortal danger in which Aragorn and company were mired.  It lacked the immediate terror, blood, and chaos of a real battle, as was so masterfully captured in some other films (for example, Saving Private Ryan.)  As well, some parts of the battle just were not believable.  Both Gimli and Aragorn literally lept on the spears of waiting Uruk-hai on two separate occasions and survived.  In Aragorn's case, he somehow ends up back in the fort to help shore up the breached gate right after he leaps off the ramparts into a swarm of Orcs, in grief at the death of Haldir.  Such things may pass you by on first viewing, but become noticeable when you see the movie for the second or third time. <br /> <br />I do not mind so much the departures from the books, according to which for example the encounter with Shelob should have been in the second movie.  However, even the extended movie did not leave me as \\"wowed\\" and awed as the first in the trilogy, it is not PERFECT enough for me to give it 5 stars.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I remember first seeing Star Wars in the theatres when they first came out. I saw them again when they were re-released with \\"new\\" footage. I also remember being put off about how they changed scenes and added completely irrelevent scenes and even scenes that, imho, actually serve to detract from the film (such as the scene in episode 4 with Solo and Jabba in the hanger). <br /> <br />I wish Lucas put the original version on DVD instead of the \\"new\\" version, however, better the new version than none at all, hence the three stars. An original version, or better yet, some sort of option to add the \\"improved\\" scenes or omit them in favor of original footage would have rated this set as 5 stars. <br /> <br />Those who have never seen the original version would find this set as 5 stars, however. I recommend it only on the basis that there is no original version of the original trilogy.
B0002VL0KQ|4.0|I'm happy Celine is getting back to serious music and working with David Foster again. Some of the songs on this album are the best she's ever done. My favorites are \\"What A Wonderful World\\" and \\"My Precious One.\\" Points off for recycling old songs and some bad recordings on songs like \\"If I Could.\\" And the fact that it's an album for babies and I don't have a baby makes me not enjoy this album as much as her others.
B00005JNEU|1.0|I am sorry. Maybe I am not a sports fan, or maybe I just don't like being sea-sick at th movies. But, this movie made me crazy. <br /> <br />The camera jumped all over the place and I thought I was going to lose my dinner, instead of just $10. I finally left an hour in. <br /> <br />I have no idea how it ended, but frankly Scarlett, I don't give a d*mn!
B000000PLL|4.0|In response to the previous reviewer I don't see how Henry Cow could be considered bourgeois.  Their music was not meant to comfort or bolster exploitative or middle class values or assumptions as to what music is or isn't.  Rather their music is a radical rethinking of both progressive rock, its symphonic pretentions, rock and improvised music.  It's radical and revolutionary, or is that an irreconcilable ambition, to make forward looking, progressive marxist music?  Maybe they should have stuck to the blues or folk music, that's proletarian isn't it?  The album is almost entirely instrumental, how in hell is that bourgeois?  The Cow mix both incredibly complex composed pieces with stretches of improvised rock and jazz-like interplay that continually challenge the listener.  You're taken on quite a wild ride with Geoff Leighs woodwinds, Fred Friths guitar, viola, the unconventional drumming of Chris Cutler, John Greaves nimble bass playing and the keyboards of Tim Hogkinson. The music is difficult and sometimes perhaps overly ambitious, but never boring.  The album is primarily instrumental, the one vocal being on the Nine Funerals of the Citizen King and you'll know why they didn't sing on any of the other tracks after hearing that one.  Henry Cow were trying to throw off convention and forge their own path and for the most part are successful with Leg End, their first album.  One thing about this CD, which is a remix: DO NOT BUY IT.  It sucks, the remixers radically changed the dynamics between the instruments and added reverb over everything all to the detriment to the music.  It sounds horrible compared to the original.  Get the original mix, its out there on Amazon.
068484267X|5.0|My High School Junior English class was assigned to find a book that portrays the American Dream in some way.  I chose this book because I had heard it was a great piece of literature and it described the hardships of Irish lives in a way that few others could even fathom.  This book made me realize how lucky I am.  Francis had to live in poverty, sickness, despair, but he always tried to find a brighter way out of things.  The book brought tears to my eyes with his descriptions of his drunk father who wouldn't support them to his mother who had such high hopes of a good life for them that were crushed by the life they lived.  It was an eye-opener to me as far as to how people lived.  I live in a comfortable house with heat and electricty but it made me realize that not all people are as fortunate as I am. Mr. McCourt used analogies in his story that I would never have even thought would have made sense until I read them here.  I love the one where he talks about how his father is like the Holy Trinity with his three different personalities.  McCourt uses the power of words to portray sadness and hope in a way that is not normally found in books.  This book was incrediable and I definatly would recommend it to anyone who needs an eye-opening experience.  I know it opened mine.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|Let's face it, no one who viewed this movie at the theatre went in expecting epic storytelling.  Still, I was a little disappointed with the storyline.  It seems we humans (or at least the American segment of humanity) have been bad little boys and girls, resulting in a calamitous change to Earth's weather patterns. <br /> <br />Folks, first of all, the science is bogus--not just the freakish, rapid-paced onset of a new ice age but also of the notion that exposing people to temperatures of -150 degrees will freeze them in their tracks.  Simply ridiculous...and any first-year physics student would agree. <br /> <br />My three stars (a borderline three stars) is for the admittedly impressive special effects.  Unfortunately, there isn't much more to the movie than that.  The story is very simple:  weather changes and people try to get to where it is warmer (by heading south).  The acting is passable, but nothing to write home about. <br /> <br />One thing that did irk me were the political overtones to the movie.  You had a U.S. Vice President character, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Dick Cheney, spouting off his \\"anti-environment\\" message.  Then you have the wise and innocent Latin American nations stating their willingness to take in the American refugees...provided we \\"evil\\" Americans forgave all of their outstanding aid loans. <br /> <br />When will Hollywood learn to put away the political axe it now incessantly grinds? <br /> <br />Okay viewing for a rainy day but not much else.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I thought Revolutions was an extremely satisfying ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. The conclusion of the movie seems to be knocked by people who simply don't understand it and don't have either the intelligence or the motivation to look beneath the film's glossy, special effects layers. <br /> <br />Neo brings about the end of the war in a quite brilliant way - Agent Smith has grown beyond the machines' control and threatens the Matrix's (and therefore the machines') very existance. All of a sudden the balance of power shifts - the machines need a human to save them (how ironic!). And this is precisely what happens. Neo (in a highly religious and symbolic ending) allows Smith to assimilate him. This gives the machines access to the Smith program, allowing them to destroy him. <br /> <br />In return for Neo's 'ultimate sacrifice' the war is called off and the salvation of Zion is assured.  <br /> <br />This movie works on so many levels - particularly biblical and Greek mythological ones. Even 50 viewings would not catch them all. I love the Matrix trilogy because I discover new things every time I watch them. I know of no other set of films that are as spectacular to watch and as thought provoking at the same time as the three Matrix films - well deserving the five star rating.
B00003CWL6|4.0|I place \\"American Beauty\\" on the same pedestal as \\"Seinfeld.\\" I enjoy(ed) both immensely for their entertainment value, yet I cannot help but be disturbed by some the cultural messages that they glorify. <br /> <br />Sam Mendes has, indeed, put together an unforgettable movie. You have Kevin Spacey giving the performance of a career as Lester Burnham, a straight-laced company man whose mid-life crisis begins when he meets the Lolita-like friend of his daughter. Mena Suvari is excellent as the aforementioned kittenish Angela--beautiful on the outside but oh-so ugly on the inside. Annette Bening plays Spacey's frustrated wife, a woman who is abhorred by her husband's descent into drugs, fast women, and fast cars, but isn't above getting a little on the side herself (courtesy of a real estate tycoon played by Peter Gallagher). <br /> <br />Thora Birch is in the role of Spacey's daughter, Jane, and gives an admirable performance of a teenager yearning for a way out of her dysfunctional family. She finds that exit in the form of Wes Bentley, who plays Ricky Fitts, a quiet teenage boy who moves into the house next door. He also moonlights as a major drug dealer, one client of whom happens to be Jane's father. Bentley's performance is truly superb.  <br /> <br />Rounding out the major players includes Chris Cooper, as Ricky's father, a Marine Corp colonel with a very, very nasty side to him; and Allison Janney as Ricky's mother, who appears shell-shocked throughout the entire movie--no doubt as the result of physical abuse inflicted upon her by her husband. Both Cooper and Janney deserved to win Oscars. <br /> <br />The musical score and cinematography are both outstanding.  <br /> <br />Despite my reservations over staring at such a sociological train wreck, I highly recommend this movie. DEFINITELY not for underage viewers. <br />
630542828X|4.0|In A Civil Action John Travolta plays Jan Schlichtmann the hottest young lawyer in Boston. He is a personal claims lawyer with a successful small practice and he is one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in Boston. Jan will do anything to win a case. During the progression of the story, he narrates advice to the audience as if a he is a law professor. It is this instruction that he himself does not follow and thus leads to trouble for himself and his clients. The movie, in this way, is almost as much about the apparently unreasonable reason behind litigation then it is about the individual case it portrays.    We are introduced to the way Jan Schlichtmann operates in a dark yet amusing prologue. This shows Schlichtmann pushing one of his unfortunate clients into court, fixing his pillows, getting him a drink, and wiping his face. All while the jury tries to choke back their tears, and the defending lawyers frantically try to settle before the trial begins by writing increasingly large settlements on a pad for Schlichtmann's approval. While this is all going on Schlichtmann gives a brilliantly deadpan voiceover, explaining how much you can expect to receive for various types of injury and which types of clients are worth more in winning cases. He concludes \\"that whites are worth more than blacks, men more than women, the rich more than the poor and a long agonizing death over a quick one. A white male professional in his 40's, in his prime earning potential, is worth the most and a dead child is worth least of all.\\"    Everything is going well for Jan and then a case with at least 10 dead children drops into his lap. This case is known as an \\"orphan\\" as it has landed in every prominent lawyer's office and all have passed on it prior to him. But Schlichtmann's firm takes on the case when he discovers that culprits are owned by two of America's major corporations WR Grace and Beatrice Foods. But for the families, money isn't the point, and all they want to know is whathappened, and for the responsible parties to come over and apologize to them for their loss. The thing is, \\"corporations apologize with money,\\" and if the corporations have deep pockets, it's a case worth taking, so money does indeed become the point in A Civil Action. From then on, we get to watch a characteristic David versus Goliath clash, which involves the lawyer with his limited team and funds and the huge corporation with unlimited resources and a very clever lawyer (Jerome Fasher) heading its case.    Schlichtmann does a couple things during the case that leads ultimately to his downfall. First, he gets personally involved. In a news broadcast, he holds up snaps of the Woburn kids who have died. He shows empathy, which is a grave disservice to the legal profession because it clouds his judgment. He says it's like a doctor recoiling at the sight of blood. That leads to his demanding of WR Grace and Beatrice Foods a multi-million dollar settlement, including money for a research foundation, to cover expenses, and to provide for the families for thirty years, which the corporations refuse, which in turn takes the case to trial. He does this without consulting his partners, which doesn't sit well. James Gordon, the accountant, points out that they need to work on other cases to provide a cash flow. Schlichtmann has sunken a million into the Woburn case, and pretty soon, they teeter on the waterfalls of bankruptcy to the point of mortgaging their homes. It's become a source of pride, which has undone many an attorney as opposed to idiot witnesses, lousy evidence, and the hanging judge put together, as Jerome Fasher (played by Robert Duvall) tells his law class.    Fasher, the attorney for Beatrice, is a statesman-like man of experience, but has a isolated yet eccentric personality. He is a knowledgeable man, and his observation on the justice system is true, but at times appalling. When Schlichtmann tells him he's searching for the truth, he tells him, \\"You've been around long enough to know that a courtroom's not the place to look for the truth.\\" And he truthfully says that the case stopped being about children the moment Schlichtmann filed for action.   Robert Duvall gives an excellent performance as Jerome Facher, Beatrice's attorney, who is the complete opposite of Schlichtmann. In a scene at a fancy hotel conference room, the frugal Facher is not impressed by any of the lawyers or their arguments, but the free pen that he can take home. It's a subtly funny scene that illustrates Facher perfectly.    The film does a great job in presenting the feelings and priorities of those injured by the negligence of a corporation. Often people think that money is everything in a civil trial, but this example shows that that is not always the case. Some of the characters evolve greatly during the story, understanding what is really important and what is superficial. This film initially gives an impression of a film where a greedy lawyer grows a conscience and starts out on a quest to defend the less privileged. But, even though the subject is not new, the way in which the story is presented and the performances by John Travolta, and especially Robert Duvall, make this a decent production nevertheless.    The blurb on the jacket claims that A Civil Action is \\"The best legal thriller ever.\\" I personally believe this quote does the film a major disservice, because by calling it a \\"thriller\\" it gives the audience the idea that this is going to be something standard and Hollywood, with the obligatory \\"Hollywood\\" ending, and it's not. It's based on true events and exposes our legal system bare, it shows the impartial brutality of the adversarial system, and how one man's flaws can be amplified by that system, until they consume not only him, but all those around him.    Trials and lawsuits are examples of how corrupt and rotten the legal system and some lawyers are. Is it worth having a system where the first party to come to their senses(i.e. to cut their losses and call for a settlement) is the loser? A Civil Action also shows that despite the need for compassion, it's better to have a lawyer who thinks more with the head than the heart. This film shows startling conclusions about our Justice system, and that is what A Civil Action chooses to focus on more so than the true story it tells. The film shows the price of justice and how justice is understood in the legal process. In fact, it draws a very fine dichotomy between non-legal and legal justice and shows how hard it is to get \\"justice\\" in a legal setting. Needless to say, it becomes a very expensive ordeal full of interpretations of the law and unfortunate manipulations of it. What we can gather from the story, however, is that we should be grateful for people who are willing to go to extreme lengths, at great personal cost, to define justice on their own terms and to fight for it.
0767836324|3.0|First of all, I think this movie is not bad, but not too good either by comparing many other spielberg's movies. I watched the movie back in 1991 when it came out, I didnt realize its directed by Spielberg until just a while ago surfing in Amazon! <br />Anyway, I just found it really interesting that this movie can work as a sequel of \\"Peter Pan\\" the other Pan movie made in 2004, it pick up perfectly where \\"peter pan\\" left off. Peter sent Wendy and the kids back home at the end of \\"peter pan\\", he come back later try to visit Wendy again, but this time in \\"hook\\", Wendy has become an old lady as its been past 50 years since his last visit in earth time! Peter then fall in love with her grand daughter and stays and gets old and so the story of \\"hook\\" begins... <br />I mean how obvious this movie can work as a sequel and it was made 12 years before the first story. ^^

0451457994|1.0|I am a literature major, so please know that I am not giving a biased and uncalled for opinion. I've read many books, and I have even liked those books that most people detest. However, I must say 2001: A Space Odyssey is not all that great. It's boring, takes forever to get to the point, and truly pointless. The movie is even worse. In reality, the movie came first and then the book---it is usually the other way around. Both are horrific.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Let us begin by agreeing on one simple fact:  Michael Moore is an idiot.  I am not attempting to make a political statement here, just a true one.  The man is a jerk.  Watch a few episodes of his TV show \\"The Awful Truth\\" for evidence of this fact.  I feel so bad for all the low-level secretaries who have to put up with this sarcastic, brash buffoon who bursts in with a camera crew and no appointment to make trouble. <br /> <br />That being said, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is Moore's strongest film, largely because it keeps Moore out of it.  The sort of aggressive grandstanding that has both made Moore famous and also most hurt his credibility is kept to a minimum here.  Even when he does, for example, take an ice cream truck around the Capitol to read the US PATRIOT Act over a loud speaker (yeah!  that'll change the world!), somebody made the very intelligent decision to cut away quickly.  Yes, he still pulls some of the same old stunts, but, unlike films like \\"Bowling for Columbine,\\" these are not the bulk of the film, but rather more like a signature:  could you call it a Michael Moore if there wasn't at least a bit of that? <br /> <br />It's been said that this is a film you should see regardless of your political views, and I agree with that.  When I watched the film, I had the thought several times that somebody was standing behind Moore with a cattle prod, ready to zap him if he didn't keep his tone on the voice-overs in check.  This restraint is what earns Moore the right, in my opinion, to at least be heard.  You know it's a passionate issue for Moore if he's willing to restrain himself so that more people will listen. <br /> <br />In the end, it's a film worth seeing and you might as well see it now, because it has the shelf life of deli ham.  If you really want to own it, wait a few months and it should be in bargain bins.  This is one of the reason that this should never be considered for Best Picture, as Moore has been campaigning for.  This isn't a film--it's an argument.  So, while it's not remotely Best Picture material, and its value is only so immediate (hence its quick move to DVD), see it.  If just to say you have.

B00005JMEW|5.0|I basically forgot about Quentin Tarentino for a number of years. After watching the fantastic \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" years ago, followed by the even better \\"Pulp Fiction\\" a couple of years later, Tarentino seemed to drop off the radar. Occasionally, you would see his mug turn up on one of those television talk shows, or hear about him doing an interview somewhere, but his career as a director seemed to have hit the skids. Then he did \\"Jackie Brown,\\" a film that certainly embodied many of the Tarentino stylistic elements (wrapped around a still foxy Pam Grier), but failed to compare favorably with his two earlier efforts. Fans of the man sat back and waited patiently for his next project, which turned out to be the hyperkinetic \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1.\\" This film reaffirms one essential fact about Quentin Tarentino: he's one of us. What I mean by that is that he's a fanboy of the sort of cheap, cheesy cinema pumped out of diverse locations such as Asia and Italy. The Spaghetti western is what I'm talking about, and chop socky potboilers from the great old days of Hong Kong. His knowledge of these usually ignored films is incredible; I've seen my fair share of low budget cult classics, and many of the references in \\"Kill Bill\\" soared right over my head. But I know enough to see where he gets his inspiration, and it's nice to see someone paying homage.<br /><br />Why even discuss the plot of a film so overanalyzed since its release? Because I like to write to excess, so here goes. The Bride (Uma Thurman) survived an assassination attempt carried out by her former partners in crime, specifically members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and has just woke up from a lengthy coma. Her last memory is, unfortunately, the sort of memory that would give the rest of us a coronary; she remembers the enigmatic leader of the group, Bill (David Carradine), putting a bullet into her head. Now she's wide awake, having lost her unborn child, and ready to get back out on the street to seek revenge against her former associates. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, they say, and boy are they right! The Bride works hard to restore her body and mind to pre-injury levels, and makes a list of five people who must go down for the agony she has endured. Victim number one is Vernita Green (Vivica Fox), who perishes after an ultracool knock down drag out fight in Green's suburban home, a fight that pauses long enough for Green's little kid to go up to her room after arriving home from school (!). The next killer to go down will be O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu), a scary thug who now runs her own organized crime racket in Japan.<br /><br />Before taking down Green and Ishi, Thurman's character heads to the Far East in search of the elusive Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), a sword craftsman extraordinaire and the man who trained Bill himself in combat techniques. But there's a big problem: Hanzo has had a change of heart and isn't interested in making weapons anymore. The Bride must convince him that what she's doing is right, which she does, and the craftsman makes his best sword for her so she can carry out her revenge plots. Hanzo's clout carries such weight in the underworld that O-Ren Ishi visibly pales when she learns what The Bride has accomplished. That's all in the future, however, as Thurman's character must battle her way through a veritable army of dangerous goons to get to O-Ren Ishi. The sinister Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), a willowy teenager who is a whiz with painful looking weaponry, is Ishi's personal bodyguard. So are the Crazy 88s, the yakuza goons that form the central pillar of Ishi's organized crime network. In a finale that one must see to believe, The Bride wreaks havoc--no, apocalyptic carnage--on O-Ren's criminal empire. Gore, blood, limbs, and assorted other body parts soar through the air as Uma goes on a one woman killing spree of epic proportions.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the various details of the movie, such as the animated sequence telling the story of O-Ren Ishi's transformation into a professional assassin, but I won't go into more particulars. \\"Kill Bill\\" is a film best experienced for oneself. I think it's wonderful that people--most of whom would never watch the sort of films Tarentino lovingly cribbed from for this masterpiece--went to see his movie in the theaters. Now do you understand why we obsess over cult cinema? Even if you don't understand the references in the film, you can still get a kick out of the over the top performances, the scorching soundtrack, and that ultracheesy atmosphere Tarentino throws around all over the place. I loved the sound effect we hear whenever The Bride homes in on one of her targets, a sort of loud siren effect that must have had viewers scratching their heads in bewilderment. My favorite part of the film was none of these things, though. I have to say Lucy Liu was the best part of \\"Kill Bill Vol.1.\\" For such a lovely looking woman, she's downright chilling as O-Ren Ishi. I thought she did a phenomenal job with her role.<br /><br />The only extras I saw on the disc I rented was a music video and a behind the scenes feature. I wouldn't even consider buying this disc right now because you just know they'll release a double disc set of both films, probably with a third disc chock full of extras. Incredibly, I have not seen \\"Kill Bill Vol.2\\" yet. I know, I know--I'll bump it up on my rental list as soon as possible. I don't know if the second installment is as good as this one, but hopefully it is just as entertaining.animated sequence telling the story of O-Ren Ishi's transformation into a professional assassin, but I won't go into more particulars. \\"Kill Bill\\" is a film best experienced for oneself.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I got this album the day it came out in Canada. I ordered it through amazon back in the end of august, but it never showed, then I got notified that it will come in by mid-November. Thank goodness Road Runner Records Released it! This, in my opinion, is the most polished sound Nightwish has produced. There other records are wonderful, but the inclusion of the London Session Orchestra really added depth. If I ever make a movie, Nightwish would be my soundtrack.<br />Track Reviews:<BR>Dark Chest of Wonders - 5/5 - Great opener, I love it, great way to introduce the orchestra as well as the choir.<BR>Whish I Had an Angel - 4/5 - Still a great song, more of a dance song and thus I am not crazy to listen to this one exessively.<BR>Nemo - 4.5/5 - It grows on you, when I first heard it I didn't really like it, thought it to be the weak part of the album. Plus, this was the single first released, it made me think that we would get our first mediocre Nightwish album. Although, now I love it, but it doesn't get 5/5 because it took awhile for me to like it.<BR>Planet Hell - 5/5 - Very, very catchy. Has an intro of choir and orchestra, then the drums, guitar and bass kick in. You can't help but turn up the stereo at this point of the song.<BR>Creek Mary's Blood - 4.5/5 - Wonderful Ballad, great guitar solo, but not one that is perfect. Perfect ballad is like Stairway to Heaven, that is my reference point.<BR>The Siren - 4.5/5 - Marco has improved his vocals in this album, it really shows off in this song. Contrasting the other tracks, this song starts off heavy then goes softer.<BR>Dead Gardens - 5/5 - You know the Lays commercial &quot;Betcha can't eat just one?&quot; well here's the add for this one: &quot;Betcha can't keep your head from nodding/banging!&quot;<BR>Romanticide - 5/5 - Heavy chorus, and great solo. The ending changes up to the ending a la Slaying the Dreamer style.<BR>Ghost Love Score - 6/5 - I can't believe how good this song is! My hands are always impersonating a choir director. This is about the only Ballad that possibly rivals Stairway to Heaven!<BR>Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan - 4/5 - Good true ballad. Nice to hear the Finnish language. My only problem is I still don't know how to pronounce the title of this song!<BR>Higher than Hope - 4/5 - Another good song, just not great.<BR>White Night Fantasy - 4.25/5 - Nice refrain from rest of album, great song, I like it better than Higher than Hope but that's it in the list of this CD.<BR>Live to Tell the Tale - 4.5/5 - Reminds me of older Nightwish, great song. I can almost see the tale...<br />There are no &quot;weak&quot; points of the album, most albums you have to push next track to go to the song you want to hear because you're not crazy about the song inbetween...well, not this album!
B0002MRPE0|2.0|Joe Cocker fans might be somewhat disappointed after listening to his latest release \\"Heart and Soul\\".  The album is only available as an import at this time, until January 29th, 2005, when it will be released domestically in the US.  It is no secret that the 60 year Cocker has been mellowing as of late, and has not really rocked on an album in quite sometime.  Usually, he records a few covers per album, and then fills the rest with newly written songs.  Although a good idea, doing an entire cd of covers presents quite a challenge.  There is nothing spectacular here, or even memorable for that matter.  His take on \\"What's Going On\\", pales in comparison to the Marvin Gaye original, and his version of U2'S \\"One\\", is very blandish.  The album is loaded with very slow feeling and uneventful ballads like \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely\\", \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\", and \\"I Who Have Nothing\\", which sounds like album filler.  His take on \\"I Put A Spell On You\\", features nice guitar work from Eric Clapton, but like most of the songs on the cd, the listener is left wondering, when is Joe going to go into high gear? The answer is he doesn't.  That is not to say, Cocker doesn't manage a few good moments, like his versions of \\"Every Kinda People\\", \\"Maybe I'm Amazed, and Lennon's \\" Jealous Guy\\", which prove to be the best cuts on the album.  At 60 years old, Joe Cocker still can belt out a tune in high octane fashion at his live concerts, and maintain that energy for almost 2 hours.  This is why it is so disappointing to hear all these slow moving mellow string section overtones, that dominate many of his latter day albums.  His last great rock tunes were 1989's \\"When The Night Comes\\" and 1992's version of Gary Wright's \\"Love Is Alive\\".  That is over 10 years ago!  I for one, like an occasional Joe Cocker ballad, but entire albums, that sound like a ballad, is not going to get him noticed anymore.  I do not know, how many albums Joe has left in him, but as a life long fan, I wouldgive anything to hear him rock just once more on a new release.  He is still one of the great classic rock voices in history, who is in need of a producer, like Charlie Midnight[Unchain My Heart etc],who will light that spark under Joe, and bring out the best in him.  Joe Cocker certainly has what it takes to do better, and hopefully, the next time around, we will get the real heart and soul of a still great singer, in need of some better written material.
B0006213WG|2.0|Nice job Sum! You switched your style. Only problem is NOW IT STINKS! If your looking to buy the new Sum 41 CD in hopes of finding the old catchy pop-punk glory your used to, you may be let down. Sum 41 changed their genre to some hard rock ish (don't really know what ish means but in this case it's not good). I bought this cd the day it came out and was extremely let down. Listened to it one time all the way through and then i retired it from my CD collection. Not good. I do not recommend. If I did have to choose the best song though, it would be track 2 (I didn't take the time to look at the song names).
B00005OAIE|4.0|Bored at work. I read about 100 of the 987 reviews of this CD.  I'd really be refreshed if you compulsive review-writers would leave out the long-winded comparisons to the DMB, J. Taylor, et al.  Should you like to review those artists, I am sure that Amazon carries some of their material as well.  This CD is what it is.  A Mayer album.  It is light hearted and fine to listen to. However, owning it is not a personal insult to past artists nor present.  I did not buy this CD INSTEAD of one of your suggested artists'; I bought it to listen to the damn thing.  So relax.  Don't be so insulted by peoples' preferences.  Also, Amazon.com's review section is not a platform from which you may fling your angry editorial rhetoric.  Take a deep breath and get a job.  Or, keep writing funny reviews for me to read during my lunch hour.  Either way, don't get yourselves so worked up.  Dang.
B0006213WG|3.0|There is ALOT of ripping-off of other bands on this CD. Theres that Linkin Park ripoff, System Of A Down ripoff (even though it ends up sounding much better than SOAD), a ripoff of Oasis AND Sum 41's old song Handle This in \\"Some Say\\", and alot of Metallica ripoffs. But still, this CD is listenable. We're All To Blame is definetly a great song.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This is a directorial debut for Ricard Kelly who also wrote the screenplay for the movie. The movie was first shown at Sundance Film Festival where it was met with a lot of enthusiasm and good reviews. This is what prompted me add this movie to my collection.<br /><br />Before watching the movie I tried not to read a lot about it's plot and in this case it was a good deccision. The story is about a troubled teenage boy who has vissions of a giant rabbit who predicts that the world will end in 28 days.<br /><br />In some ways this movie reminds me of \\"12 Monkeys\\" as it deals with time travel and the parradoxes connected to it. But the plot and the movies 1980's surreal subburban setting are highly original. The production designer Alexander Hammond (\\"K-Pax\\", \\"Men in Black II\\") did an excellent job of capturing various setting in which the story takes place. Surreal feel to the movie is greatly helped by the beautifull cinematography of Steven Poster (\\"Someone to watch over me\\").<br /><br />The movies cast is diverse. The lead role of Donnie Darko is extremly well performed by Jake Gyllenhaal, previously unknown actor to me. He does a nice job of playing an emotionally disturbed teenager and the best scenes are his confrontations with the rabbit. The rabbit is played by James Duval (\\"Gone in sixty seconds\\").<br /><br />In the roles of Donnies teachers among other we can see Noah Wyle (\\"E.R.\\") and Drew Barrymore and they did a good but not a memorable performances. Aslo, Patrick Swayze appears in the role of righteous self help guru.<br /><br />But the real strong point of the movie is it's open and undefined ending which leaves you wandering and prompts you to think about it. Not everyone will like the movie but all will at least think about the massage it tries to tell. It is intentionally made this way and the director says so in the commentary. The story is intentionaly left to open interpretation by the viewer which is great.
6304211740|2.0|I have a big problem when the screenwriters and directors take liberties with my favorite books. <br /> <br /> The glaring error of this version has to be William Hurt as Rochester. Although Mr.Hurt is a capable actor, he doesn't look at all the way Mr.Rochester is portrayed in the novel. Rochester should be a dark haired, brooding character. He has been far better represented on film by Orson Welles and Timothy Dalton. I personally prefer a British actor to be in this role, as well. <br /> <br />Blanche Ingram is supposed to be black haired. Although the average reader would not know why, this is a very important part of Victoriana. Black hair in this time period was considered the apex of beauty. Blanche is supposed to be the most beautiful women in the town. <br /> <br />I didn't care for the omissions of plot or character, either. The whole section where Jane meets the Rivers family is rushed. We never find out she is their cousin. <br /> <br />Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and I keep looking for faithful versions of the film. Someday someone will make one. This one is just \\"so-so\\"
B00005JLWN|4.0|Many people compared this movie to the \\"Matrix\\", which I love, so I decided to add it to my movie collection. When I watched it for the first time I was pleasently surprised that it was as good as the Matrix and maybe in some ways even better. But it wouldn't be fair to compare the two movies too much since Equilibrium deserves better. <br />The movie's plot is set in near future after the third world war which nearly destroyed humanity. It was decided that emotions were to blame for the war so they were banned. Whole population is forced to take drugs regularly to prevent emotions. The government uses a religious sect called \\"Clericks\\" to find \\"sence offenders\\", ruthlesly kill them and destroy anything that can cause emotions. In this regard this movie reminds me of \\"1984\\" but \\"Big Brother\\" is replaced by \\"Father\\" and \\"Fahreheit 451\\" but instead of burning book they burn paintings, books, records... <br />Movies action sequences are beautifully coreographed and, even though they remind me of the Matrix, manage to be inovative. The \\"Clericks\\" are warior priests who have developed the fighting style which is based on statisticaly predicting the possitions of the multiple opponents in any closed quarter battle. The \\"Clericks\\" then practise the moves, which almost look like dancing, that enable them to kill most of the opponent in the most efficient way.  <br />John Preston played by Christian Bale is the best of the \\"Clericks\\" and he kills \\"sense offenders\\" without remorse or regret. One day he accidentally skips his daily dose of the drug and is for the first time confronted with emotion. Every day since then his emotions are getting stronger and he even joins the underground movement he so diligently fought to destroy. The performance of mr. Bale is excellent. He manages to show the range of emotional confict his character is feeling with minimum facial expressions but to great effect.  <br />The movie is written and directed by Kurt Wimmer. This is his directorialdebut but he has worked as a writer before on movies like \\"Sphere\\" and \\"Thomas Crown Affair\\".  <br />Even though it can be said this is a Science Fiction movie I believe it is best described as action movie with elements of science fiction. The story primarily deals with the conflict of the individual with the repression of the government. The individual is defined by his emotions which the government tries to limit and control.  <br />The world in which the movie takes place is grim and grey looking city which reminds me a little of the movie \\"Dark City\\" but is slicker, cleaner and more futuristic.  <br />
B000002ADT|5.0|This is the work of the Divine in its purest form. It is too flawless to be made by only the hands and minds of men. There is something greater here.......
B00003CXCT|1.0|I'm sure everyone is aware by now that this DVD release is a for \\"special\\" editions only.  Various scenes have been added, deleted, and/or redone.  Most of the changes made to these films are in poor taste and do not add anything worthwhile to the original editions.  I am very disappointed with this DVD release and hope that George Lucas will rethink his attitude regarding releasing these movies in their original format.  I hope that my children will one day have the opportunity to see these films the way they were originally released.  Big thumbs down to these \\"new\\" editions.  They are a novelty at best.
B000002KDO|5.0|Black Sabbaths first two albums were f**king amazing and this one no doubt has its fair share of godliness as well. But I always thought that this just never lived up to the first two since the songs, well, they just weren't as good. DO NOT GET ME WRONG ON THIS ALBUM! Its amazing, if you'll notice the five star rating then you would have known that by now and that this album DOES deserve your attention. Five stars is the best rating here and that means that this is awesome. Right, on to the album. There are many good songs here like 'Children of the Grave' and 'Sweet Leaf' which are arguably some of Sabbaths best pieces. I really cant say anything that hasn't already been said about this so just buy it and thank me later!
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This concert is amazing, but regarding the 5.1 it goes really bad half way through the concert, at firt i thought it was my home theater system, but after reading other reviews with the same problem i guess the problem is with the DVD itself. if you are used to hear your concerts in 5.1 you will find this change of quality midthrough the concert very annoying.
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen was so different from any band seen or heard before. Once they unleashed the masterpiece 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (One of my top ten favorite songs ever) it was clear they had a promising career ahead of them and this double album sums up the greatest moments of their career. Nearly every song here is amazing, this is truly one of the only good greatest hits albums that deserves to be made unlike the Nirvana or Guns N' Roses greatest hits (C'mon guys! You know those bands have only made three studio albums whereas Queen has made AT LEAST twenty). This is definately an essential fgor any Queen fan or just any rock fan in general.  <br />   Freddie Mercury (God rest his soul) could not have done a better job on these songs and I have to admit next to Robert Plant he is the greatest rock vocalist ever! Not to mention that he could play the piano and thats for damn sure! John Deacon is one of the greatest bass players of all time, the only God that I can think of thats better than him is Cliff Burton (Metallicas second and by far best bassist). Brian May is also a brilliant guitar player, I really couldn't say how awesome his melodies/solos are since I was truly blown away. The drummer is good as well, but he doesn't stand out as much as the other members. <br />   All in all this album is a must have, there really arent any better greatest hits (except for maybe Elvis or the Beatles) and if you dont already have this then buy it now/soon or consider yourself a retard.
B000244EMO|4.0|This movie: awesome... <br />Except for the face of Jessie Ventura, it's a flawless action alien blow-up flic.  Arnold plays the good guy with brains and brawn and a foreign woman to boss around.  He does this well while bossing the hell out of pretty much everyone and thing in sight. <br />The Predator is this grotesque, liver spot-covered, balding Bob Marley--except it's an alien.  It has cool gadgets too, and disgusting ways of skinning people and drying them in trees.  The dried corpses almost look tasty, hanging there like Oberto jerky... <br /> <br />...Anyone ever hear of Ed Gein?  No?  Good...good...
B00005JMXX|3.0|I am eminently capable of enjoying movies with stupid science and/or stupid characters, but there has to be some sort of redeeming quality.  For example, even the pie plate flying saucer in \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" sounds good compared to the idea of thinking yourself into the past in \\"Somewhere in Time,\\" but that film had Christopher Reeve making the grand romance work.  The problem with \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is that the best part of the movie comes in the first act, and that is not where you want it to be.<br /><br />The stupid science here is to take the idea of global warming leading to a radical shift in climate that creates a new ice age and instead of it happening over centuries or years reduce in to days and weeks.  No wonder scientists were rending their garments over this film, because even though I never took even biology in high school I know that what is being played fast and loose with in this film goes way beyond hearing explosions in the vacuum of space.  However, the whole point of this stupid science is to allow director Roland Emmerich, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeffrey Nachmanoff, yet another opportunity to destroy New York City, having taken major bites out of the Big Apple in both \\"Independence Day\\" and \\"Godzilla.\\"  But Emmerich is more ambitious this time around, having tornadoes play havoc with the landmarks in Los Angeles before putting NYC in a deep freeze.<br /><br />In the grand cinematic tradition that goes back beyond Watergate to the science fiction films of the 1950s, a brilliant scientist, climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), gets to sound like Cassandra while Vice President Cheney, er Becker (Kenneth Welsh), worries about the fragile economy rather than the fast approaching end of the world as we know it.  Hall gathers data and yells that the sky is falling but nobody really pays attention until giant hall comes raining down from the sky, giant tidal waves flood the Eastern seaboard, and a trio of what would be called hurricanes if they were not situated over the three northern continents instead of tropical waters re-program the planet's climate.<br /><br />The nice thing about identifying the point in this 2004 summer flick where it crosses the line is that Quaid's character actually draws it on a map of the United States.  A trio of killer storms are going to be raging for days over the northern part of the planet.  The temperature is dropping to below -150 degrees, the point at which fuel freezes, where people freeze to death on the spot.  Hall draws a line across the middle of the country and tells the President (Perry King) to order the evacuation of everybody south of the line to Mexico and forget the rest because basically they are dead already.  At that point the voice of sanity and reason in the film announces he is going to go to New York City to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal).  Sam, the girl (Emmy Rossum) he likes, the rest of the members of the school smart person squad, and assorted citizens of New York are trapped in the New York Public Library which is flooded by freezing water and contains a copy of the Gutenberg Bible.  Sam is smart enough to figure out how to call his father, who tells him to wait there and he will come to get him.<br /><br />On the one hand kids should always call their parents when they are going to be late coming home, especially when a natural disaster beyond imagination is responsible for the delay.  But if our heroic scientist wants the President and everybody else to write off every human being living above his line of demarcation (my guess is that Canada and Scandinavia are no longer contenders for Olympic gold in hockey), he should practice what he preaches.  Otherwise, he becomes a stupid character.  Beyond that, while I like the idea that a Ph.D. can stop you and people who travel with you from freezing to death when everybody else is dying in their steps, I am pretty sure we are back to stupid science (I bet the Ph.D. has to be in a scientifically related area, which means rhetorical studies does not count).  I live in a place where it is winter six months of the year (our first snow is expected tomorrow night), so I know the value of dressing warmly.  But there are repeated scenes of people dressed warmly freezing to death in this movie so unless Hall is carrying the One Ring or has some other magic talisman that can temporarily dispel the coming of a new ice age, he and the other stupid characters stupid enough to insist on going with him on his stupid mission and all going to die stupidly (unless, of course, the screenwriters just stupidly ignore their own premises and continue with their story unabated by reason).<br /><br />Basically \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is a disaster film more in the tradition of \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" (bad thing happens at the start and people try to survive) versus \\"The Towering Inferno\\" (bad thing happens at the end and people try to survive).  Part of the problem is that there are several extended scenes of mass destruction early in the film and then things get relatively boring with ice forming and ice breaking being the key developments.  The other part of the problem is that nobody in the film is as interesting as Shelley Winters.  My favorite character in the film ends up being Jeremy (Tom Rooney), who has decided that if he is to die his final act is going to be to save one very special book from being burned in the effort to stay warm.  Nothing else in the film has the intelligence or the nobility of that moment.lated area, which means rhetorical studies does not count).

B0001WTVUW|5.0|The political controversy over \\"The Day After\\" when it was first broadcast in 1983 had to do with the idea that a television movie about a nuclear war was an indictment of the policies of the Reagan Administration.  Of course \\"The Day After\\" was not an attack on a particular president, but rather it represented the liberal nightmare of the worst of all possible futures, with a full out nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Four years later the ultimate conservative nightmare was aired with the mini-series \\"Amerika,\\" in which the United States has been taken over by the Communists.  Both were predicated on questionable assumptions, the former on an escalation of a conflict over Berlin and the later on the effects of an electro-magnetic pulse, but those were both simply excuses to tell the story that wanted to be told.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"The Day After\\" is not so much a story as it is a depiction of what a nuclear war would be like that comes under the heading of \\"seeing is believing.\\"  Prior to the airing of this television film Hollywood showed what it was like to live in the world after a nuclear war in films from \\"On the Beach\\" to \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,\\" suggested that a nuclear war would be so horrible that a president would drop nuclear bombs on New York City rather than go to war in \\"Fail Safe,\\" and ended the Cold War satire of \\"Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" with a series of atom bomb's exploding set to the popular song \\"We'll Meet Again.\\"  But what they did not show was what that nuclear war would be like.  Even the \\"Star Wars\\" universe assumed there would be a nuclear war some day, as did I, but depicting the horrors of such a war was never really done until \\"The Day After.\\"<br /><br />However, exploding mushroom clouds and the victims of radiation poison were not what was most memorable about \\"The Day After.\\"  The icon image from the film became the shots of the missiles taking off, with the people of Lawrence, Kansas looking up into the sky at the ICBMs headed towards the Soviet Union knowing that their missiles were heading for us.  Suddenly it became clear that the true moment of horror would be when you saw those missiles because chances were you would never see the mushroom cloud that took your life.  In fact, given the choice between being incinerated and surviving long enough to watch your loved ones suffer horribly, I think most people would hope for the quick death.  This film turned those last few minutes of life from the old joke about how you need to bend over, put your head between your knees and kiss you ass goodbye into an enduring image of outright terror.<br /><br />The worst moments of this film are the painful period between the missiles taking off and the nukes exploding.  One of the silos is right next to the Dahlberg farm, and the emotion nadir of the film is Denise Dahlberg (Lori Lethin) comes down the stairs holding the wedding dress she will never get to wear and her father tells her to get into the storm cellar.  Then Jim Dahlberg (John Cullum) has to go upstairs and drag his wife Eve (Bibi Besch) screaming and crying away from the bed she is making in a desperate attempt to pretend that the world is not coming to an end.<br /><br />Jason Robards is Dr. Russell Oakes, who along with Nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams) has to deal with the casualties following the detonations at a besieged hospital,  and Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) is the guy who takes refuge with the Dahlbergs.  Joe Huxley (John Lithgow) is the college professor who gets to supply most of the relatively small amount of exposition the story requires: a student thinks they are safe because Kansas is in the middle of nowhere, but the professor is the one who points out \\"There's no 'nowhere' anymore\\" since there is an Air Force base and 150 Minutemen Missile silos spread halfway down Missouri, all constituting \\"an awful lot of bullseyes.\\"  When the missiles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well.<br /><br />I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched \\"The Day After\\" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a \\"nuclear winter\\" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen.  To say that this was a sobering idea to give an audience that was already depressed by what they had seen, would be an understatement.  Sagan, of course, was opposed to the use of nuclear weapons and condemned the arms race.  Speaking on the other side, which is to say in favor of the concept of nuclear deterrence, was William F. Buckley, Jr., and what we got to see in that debate (which is still available on video) was that both were right.<br /><br />It is rather amazing, given the history of humanity, that it has been almost sixty years since nuclear weapons have been used in war.  Ironically, we now live in a world where we still believe that those weapons are going to be used, although now we assume it will be the work of terrorists (or an attempt to stop terrorists) and not a war between East and West.  I would not be surprised if right now Hollywood is kicking around ideas of what it would be like the day after that sort of nuclear detonation, going beyond what we saw in \\"The Sum of All Fears.\\"  Hopefully it would be as successful at forestalling our worst nightmares as \\"The Day After\\" has been these many years.When the missiles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well. <br /> <br />I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched \\"The Day After\\" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a \\"nuclear winter\\" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen.

B00005JMXX|2.0|In a nutshell: Excellent musical score, good special effects, so-so acting, horrible sceenplay.  Big budget flick that fails to live up to the hype.    Here's why.  The opening 40 minutes were much like Independence Day; A fast-paced, exciting catastrophy unfolds, this time in the form of super-storms that envelope the northern hemisphere in an ice age.  Lots of good CGI work makes it look impressive on the screen.  It looks like the world's in big trouble again... and then... the story goes to hell in a handbasket, just like Independence Day.  Thankfully, Director Roland Emmerich keeps the Will Smith humor out of this one.  But the story has little substance.  Here's a few of the many flaws I noticed (I left the scientific ones out):    1. Dennis Quaid's character walks(!!!) to New York in search of his son, in the freeze that's supposed to kill everyone who gets caught in it, losing one of his friends in the process.  And, it turns out, his son was just fine because he took his father's advice NOT to go outside.    2. Helicopters flying around tornados?  Just ask a pilot.    3. Scottish research station filled with Englishmen?  Where's William Wallace when we need him?    4. Dizzy-pretty girl tries to rescue a purse that ain't even her's, with a 100ft tsunami coming down the pipe?    5. The freighter sailing down Manhattan... a good laugh, though.    6. You just gotta love that tent Quaid's character stays in.  Looks like a Wal Mart special.    7. Wolves that can scale the side of a freighter?  Unrealistic looking, too.    8. The President simply dies off in the movie.  What happened?  Did a 200ft chunk of ice crush his motorcade or did he slip and fall like Atkins did?    9. Mexico closes off the border!  Muevete!  The Gringos are coming!  We need bigger gates!    10. When it's cold out, you usually can see your breath.  They could have at least added it with CGI.      OK, enough of the criticism.  The best scene; Watching the reporter get wiped out by the billboard!      I strongly recommend that if you must see this movie, rent it first.  I watched my brother's copy, so he's out the $15.  It's not one that'll be in my collection any time soon.
B00005JLXE|2.0|\\"Daredevil\\" deserves credit for effort.  The director, Mark Steven Johnson, loves the character dearly, gleefully throwing old images from the comic book onto the screen and going out of his way to create a logistically sound \\"radar sense.\\"  But it's all so reverent to the Marvel strip that it doesn't explore any new ground; Johnson almost seems afraid to add any idea of his own.  The film is beautifully designed and photographed, incorperating elegant blues, reds, and blacks, but the surface sheen can't gloss over a movie that's starved for imagination.  It's all standard action-film fare, complete with the requisite computer-assisted fight choreography of post-\\"Matrix\\" cimema, and a cast that knows that it's not as important as the special effects.  Indeed, the cast is a special effect, one created to sell tickets to an otherwise apathetic audience; Daredevil isn't a household name, so the movie provides us with actors who are.  They do serviceably, but more thoughtful casting would have added much-needed depth to this bland production.  This movie dares very little.  Features Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, and a tweeking Colin Farrell.
B0002CTSW2|5.0|I was hesitant to watch the movie because of all the reports I had heard about the level of violence.  However, my curiosity finally won out and when my neighbour got the DVD, I simply had to watch it.<br />I loved it!  I was absorbed in the movie from the very start and it never let go.  It was intense.<br />Yes there was violence, and yes Gibson didn't shield us one bit from the enormity of it.  It is graphic and in your face, however it is NOT gratuitious violence.  It was simply a portrayal of what actually happened (well, if you believe in the bible).  Of course, I still had to cover my eyes at some points.  (Interestingly, some movie critics who complained about the level of violence in this movie are perfectly happy with the senseless blood and gore of Hollywood flicks.  Go figure.)<br />I found the pacing fantastic.  The use of the languages of the day actually helped the authenticity of the movie.  I think that was an excellent decision by Gibson.  The cinematography was breathtaking.  The portrayal of the Devil sent shivers down my spine.  The final scene with the Devil and the final scene of the movie were absolutely perfect.  I won't say more because I simply can't give that away.<br />The movie followed Jesus only during those last hours of his life from the Garden of Gethsemene to the tomb.  Sprinkled throughout were flashbacks that did a fantastic job of linking Jesus' life and teachings to his crucifixtion.  One could almost see his apostles watching the events, remembering what Jesus had said, and experiencing a mini-revelation, finally unerstanding what Jesus meant.<br />Another thing I loved about the movie was the excellent use of eye contact.  So much was said without words.  Like the rest of this movie, it was powerful.<br />Also, those who have done some research into the Passion will realize that Gibson drew from a variety of sources to flesh out the biblical story.  Writings and from various Saints were used.  There is so much symbolism andso much depth to the movie.  As I said, fantastic.<br />Finally, all the &quot;bit characters&quot; in this story were fleshed out with their own personalities, constraints, hopes, and viewpoints.  The Romans were not all carbon copies of each other.  Nor were the Jews.  And along the way, we saw characters touched and moved by the events taking place.<br />Definitely a movie to see, and absolutely a movie to talk about afterwards.  All in all, an excellent movie that made the last hours of Jesus' life more real.
B00064MW6A|4.0|Ok, being a die-hard comic book fan, I was most unhappy when I found out that Catwoman's origin, name, and special abilities were being re-written to fit into a new movie starring Halle Berry.  Boo!  I was definitely not planning on seeing it... but I got two free tickets when I bought the Batman Animated Series and the Challenge of the Super Friends series on DVD.... so I took a friend with me on a rainy day to see the movie, not expecting much.  However, when you have low expectations, you find yourself less disappointed, and vice versa (I went into Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow expecting great things and felt let down.)  I found Catwoman a rather enjoyable movie, especially for free :)  I put all my prejudices aside and decided to take it for what it was: an entertaining super-being (seeing as how shes neither a hero nor villain) romp that ended up being really fun to watch. And watching Halle Berry roam around in that cat costume gave me motivation to work out and get my abs as tight as hers!  It's no Spider-Man,  and definitely no Kill Bill, but it was good nonetheless.
6301661737|5.0|The backdrop of the story is Sengoku Japan where the daimyos of great clans vie with one other for supremacy. The ultimate goal is to become shogun to replace the now powerless Ashikaga of Kyoto. At the center of the tale is Shingen, lord of the Takeda clan, a warlord of surpassing skill, who strikes fear in the hearts of his enemies and inspires bravery and undying loyalty in his own men. Shingen is at the apex of his power, his armies threaten to crush Tokugawa Ieyasu the chief ally of his implacable foe, Oda Nubunaga. However, in an irony of fate, Shingen is mortally wounded. Shingen, along with his chief retainers are well aware that his death not only signals an end to his aspirations to crush the Tokugawa and Oda clans and to declare a Takeda shogunate, but also that it might, in fact, lead to the destruction of the Takeda clan under the leadership of his intemperate son, Katsuyori. So, a plan is devised to use a kagemusha (shadow warrior) to keep the enemies of the Takeda in check for three years (the significance of the period in question is never explained). The film is a visual masterpiece, Kurosawa has an equally good eye for epic as well as ordinary moments. Human bonds (and, perhaps, bondage) are at the heart of the story. A petty thief is torn and hollowed by having to assume the outward persona of a larger than life figure. In time his misery is comforted by the love of a child and, for a moment, he forgets... The destruction of the Takeda army at Nagashino is the predictable result of the revelation of Shingen's death. The kagemusha now half man, half ghost, watches in horror as warriors and horses are cut down; he watches their death throes and his remaining hold on a sense of self is finally lost in that danse macabre.  <br /> <br />Kurosawa's choice of putting real historical figures in a stylized and mythical tale is somewhat problematical. It creates a number of creative constraints, while, nevertheless, taking liberties with the historical record. Regardless, it is a great movie, one that, in a number of ways, anticipates Kurosawa's final triumph, the sublime Ran. <br />
B00005KARK|5.0|This is perhaps the finest Disney film ever released.  Produced  during the Golden Age of Walt Disney, its no surprise it was the follow-up effort to Fantasia (itself nominated to the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Movies).  This was back when Disney films were art; not vehicles for commercial consumption. <br /> <br />Dumbo is a simple but unforgettable story that evokes strong emotions of joy and sadness (the scene in which Dumbo is briefly reunited with his imprisoned mother is absolutely beautiful and still has the power to bring adult viewers to tears).  Following the precept that a picture tells a thousand words, the film utilizes an economy of songs and dialogue; but the animation conveys human emotions that are universal and easily understood. <br /> <br />The animated characters are more \\"life-like\\" than most actors, the dialogue, short but effective, the songs and song sequences (\\"Baby Mine,\\" \\"Pink Elephants on Parade,\\" etc.,), poetic and haunting.   <br /> <br />Parents are making a mistake \\"shielding\\" their children from this picture.  If anything, the film is chillingly realistic in its portrayal of human cruelty and feelings of isolation and sadness.  But Dumbo also celebrates triumph over adversity, friendship, courage, and the parental love of a child. The movie's \\"happy ending\\" is incredibly uplifting and inspiring.  Parents might shield their children from Dumbo, but they can't shield them from the world or these emotions.  Children would be best served if parents watched the movie with them and worked through the film's powerful messages. <br /> <br />Snow White and Fantasia may have been the two movies that made the AFI's list, but for my money, Dumbo is the best Disney film ever made.  It is flawless and absolutely brilliant.
B00005JLXE|4.0|DAREDEVIL gave me what I wanted as a fan of the comic and threw in a few twists too. Great movie and the director's cut should be better. I don't agree with the reviewers who say the writer didn't bring any imagination or original ideas to the mix. He did. The entire vigilante to hero angle is a new and major one and a gutsy one.
068987474X|5.0|...This book may put you out of business real fast! I thoroughly loved this book for its wit, charm, and, ultimately, for it's truth. What do women really want? The TRUTH! In this book you can expect to find out what the signs are that tell women how to read a man's behavior (his words are totally worthless) to gauge his level of interest in you, or whether or not he's in love with you. And it works so well, I have even bonus-learned how to see my own behavior, and stop wasting my energy with men I'm just not really that into, as well.  <br /> <br />It's a powerful read for most single women who have this attitude that men are somehow truly complicated and because they call you and ask you out, that means they want to marry you someday. At least you know that this is usually never the reason a guy wants to take you out, or even talk to you. It's so wonderful to know that I can now steer clear of those ego-manical jug-heads who only want attention, or are just playin' me. I've been burned too many times to ignore such a fantastic book, and I bet you, the average American single female, can relate to me.  <br /> <br />And, I say to the men out there, whom I've heard actually think this book is liberating for them, how the heck is that possible? You say that you no longer need to actually verbalize your lack of interest in your girlfrends anymore, but now you just have a book that will encourage these women, whom you don't really like all that much anyway, to DUMP you! Do you really want to be dumped by that chick that you don't dig? How humiliating! This book can only be good for men to either wake them up to a sense of their own duty to let go of the women whom they do not want to be truly involved with, or to help clue them into when women are just not really into them.
B00005JMJG|1.0|This movie is based on the idea of there exists true love. This is not true at all. Men and women and especially men are interested in basically one thing and that one thing is sex. Once the sex gets boring people move on. That is why there are so many break ups and divorces. We need to make more realistic movies that investigate sex and sexuality. This movie was crap
B00005JMXX|1.0|This movie was such a letdown for me! I couldn't wait 'til it was released on DVD because I didn't see it in the theater. I agree with others as far as having only about 2 minutes worth of disaster scenes. The acting was almost as bad as in Airforce1. I almost died laughing during the scene where Dennis Quaid's son gets thru to him on the phone and he says to him, \\"I'm at THE library\\". THE library??? Like there's ONLY one library in NYC??? I could go on and on but I think I made my point. Take the advice of others here. Rent don't buy!
0553208845|5.0|I first read this book when I was 16 for my IB English 3 class. I had some contemplation background before I read Siddhartha. To this day, Siddhartha is my favorite work - powerful and soul-stirring.  I will not bother to tell the plot since there are 300+ other reviews. I still remeber the book vividly and from time to time read it again and again.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, I must warn readers; this work has a unique flavor.  Many people missed the boat when reading Siddhartha, including my entire class. To confirm my feelings about Siddhartha, one day during school I privately confronted my teacher about Siddhartha. She was so happy that I understood and she sensed it, saying to me \\"Isn't it such a wonderful thing to know for the rest of your life?\\" Indeed.<br /><br />  What disheartens me, however, is that some reviewers praise Siddhartha for the wrong reasons.  On a positive note, those who rebuke Siddhartha only prove part of its meaning.<br /><br />If you find that Siddhartha brings you a feeling of enlightenment, I would recommend reading about Plato's beauty theory and Aristole's contemplation as true happiness claim in Nicomachaen Ethics.<br /><br />  Despite my awareness, I believe everyone should try to read this work and attempt to understand it, even if it takes years.<br /><br />Hate, love, passion, desire, sorrow...<br /><br />This life, this existence...all so beautiful...
0790729350|5.0|Michael Wadleigh was the director of that hidden cult movie -Wolfen - in the early eighties , but in this documental film , he got an artistic triumph because he literally broke the walls with a challenge work , which meant to take and preserve in the screen the original emotion , the astonishing histamina and the essential spirit and frenetic state of a generation tired of waiting .<br />For the first time you were capable of watching a seventy two hour show with colossal figures and authentic rock legends .<br />The absence of technological support worked out better as an advantage than a weakness , because the real spirit was transfered without distortions , you will watch special lights effects but the music emerged such as a force of nature .<br />Hendrix was simply a God guitar . Fortunately the new generations have been capable to enjoy this recording through that admirable CD : Hendrix live in Woodstock.<br />Santana performance with Chepito Areas in the percusion playing Soul Sacrifice was one of the peak highlights .<br />How can you forget the legendary Joe Cocker performance singing With a little help from my friends?<br />But what about the Who and his outstanding piece: See me , Feel me , touch me from Tommy .<br />Alvin Lee the faster guitar in the world in those ages playing I'm goin' home , or that ravishing performance of Crosby Stills Nash and Young playing Judy blue eyes .<br />Richie Havens with his dark voice playing Freedom and Sly and the Stone Family , The Butterfield Blues band , Canned Heat , Jefferson Airplane and Mountain made of that mythical encounter an unique mass phenomen due precisely that spontaneity , that rebel rage , those wildful rhythms and those illusions belonged not only to my emotional memory but a countless young people at that time loaded with a special commitment that hardly you will be able to forget .<br />Can you imagine that Woodstock Festival with Led Zepellin ,  Cream, Steppenwolf, Al Kooper, Deep Purple and Traffic ?<br />It would have meant the supreme dream .me dream .
0765301598|5.0|The history of the computer jihad is brought to a triumphant conclusion in this final chapter of the Legends of Dune trilogy.  The computer evermind Ominus still controls half of the known worlds, while the humans (or hrethgir as the computers like to call them) control the other half.  The Cymeks have been reduced in power so much that they are almost irrelevant, and for the most part do not come into play until the end of the book.  The computers and humans have fought to a stand still, and for sixty five years neither one has been able to gain an advantage over the other.  That is until with the help of a deranged human, the computers release a plaque upon all of humanity.  The intent was to weaken the human population so much so that they would be unable to stand up against the machine onslaught that was to follow.  Forty percent of the human population dies from the plaque and millions more die from the repercussions that follow.  Out of this rubble rises a cult lead by one of the Butler's (or Harkonnen's) nieces, Rayna Butler.  The cult at first goes about destroying all computers with gel circuitry (meaning the ones that can think for themselves), but then when they become more fanatical they turn their vengeance on destroying all computers in general, even the ones that are being used for good.  Even if humanity is able to recover in time to stop the onslaught from the computers, they may still find themselves set back to the dark ages, as all knowledge that was being stored on the computers is lost.<br /><br />In order to avert this set back, Humanity, in many different forms tries to raise itself to a new level of being.<br /><br />On Rosak the sorceresses there had started a genealogy project to help keep track of the best samples of all of humanity in case entire races were wiped out by the plaque.  In all of the previous Dune books that I had ever read I had always found the Bene Gesserits to be selfish in my opinion.  I always thought that all of their gene manipulation was an attempt to try to create the perfect human, or champion for themselves so that they could rule the world.  In this book however, for the first time you are shown their intentions in a more noble light in that they are trying to reach a new level of humanity in order to help keep it from becoming extinct.<br /><br />On Ginaz the swordmasters there continue to perfect their training so that their minds and bodies can react faster than a computers.<br /><br />Mohandas Suk becomes a famous doctor by setting up a universal hospital to try to find a cure for the plague, and with the help of Vorian Atreides' daughter Raquella Berto-Anirul, they draw upon the knowledge of all the world doctors to make great strides in medicine.<br /><br />The evil robot Erasmus is still around, and he teaches his human prot&eacute;g&eacute; (or son) Gilbertus how to organize his thoughts and mind in such a way that he can reach a level comparable with that of a computer.  Erasmus begins to call him his mentat.<br /><br />It is at this time that it is discovered that the only ones who do not seem to be effected by the plague are those who have been eating melage on a regular basis.  The demand for spice becomes astronomical.  Since spice can only be found on Arakis, it is at this point that this planet starts to take on great importance in the world.<br /><br />People began consuming spice in larger quantities than they had ever eaten previously.  For some special individuals it begins to change them.<br /><br />By consuming large quantities of spice gas the navigator is born.  This is a creature that was once human, but now has the ability to look into the future to safely guide a ship through space.<br /><br />On Rosak the sorceresses are especially affected as a second plague is released upon them worse then the first.  With a combination of increased spice intake mixed with the unique minerals that are only found in the jungles of Rosak, the first mother superior is developed in what turns out to be a new line of Bene Gesserits.  Besides being able to use their bodies as a weapon, they have now developed the ability to control their internal body chemistry as well.  The first signs of using \\"voice\\" are also noted.  The mother superior can also see into the future as well as into the past, and draw upon knowledge from her female ancestors.<br /><br />While the humans are trying to reach this higher level of being, some of the computers seem to take on more human qualities.  Chirox, the computer fighting mek who has been training human swordmasters for years proves to be more noble than the majority of humans who are part of the cult.  The Robot Erasmus who had spent years torturing humans now takes on a new respect for them after he develops a sense of love for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and starts to think of him as his son.  Even the evermind Omnious takes on a love of art (even though he isn't very good at it).<br /><br />The question seems to come down to whether humans are capable of scarifying billions of lives in order to avoid extinction, and still maintain their humanity.  Vorian Atreides who has been one of the constants through out this trilogy is given the main task of dealing with this moral dilemma, along with Abulurd Butler (Harkonnen) who for the most part in this story has looked up to Vorian as a type of father figure.  The results of this outcome sets the stage for the conflicts that follow between the Atreides and Harkonnens for the next millennium.<br /><br />Family relationships are also a constant throughout these books.  The father/son relationships are the most prevalent, but there are many other mother/daughter, father/daughter, mother/son relationships as well that really take this book to a higher level.  I would rank this as one of the best books I've ever read.  It looks like Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson might try to pick up the series next after Frank Herbert's \\"Chapterhouse: Dune\\".  Based on how they ended this series I believe they are now in a good position to accomplish that and move the story forward to new ground.

B0000640VO|5.0|This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen. I can't even descibe how surprised I was with it. For a long time everyone had been telling me \\"Oh, what a wonderful movie!\\" and I only thought, \\"Yes, well there are LOTS of wonderful movies\\". At last I got this one and watched it. It was the most fun I'd had in a while. <br />You're REALLY got to be quick with this movie because it's subtitled and the dialogue is really clever- but also EXTREMELY fast. If you miss anything they're saying you'll be sorry because a moment later you could be in one of Amelie's visions and wonder to yourself \\"What's going on?!\\" <br />The story is of a girl who finds a box full of childrens toys from the fifties hidden in a hole in her bathroom. She comes to a desicion that she will find the owner and give back the box- and if it brings the owner joy then she'll commit herself to doing good deeds. It's full of such wonderful wit- some of it very twisted and at moments so sudden you can't help but laugh in surprise and delight. Alas when Amelie DOES commit herself to a life of good deeds she finds herself searching for the owner of a lost photo album, and begins to fall in love with him (though they've never met)! It's beautifully filmed with stunning imagery and computer graphics, and is all alround inspiring. It makes one want to get up and do what they REALLY want to do in their lives, whether it's travel the world or have a small orgasm in a cafe bathroom.
B000002UAX|5.0|I've heard the White Album before but never really listened <br />closely, just kind of glossed over it.  I heard Disc One the  <br />other night, really listened to it, and it was an emotional <br />experience.  I'm waiting on my shipment from Amazon to hear disc <br />two.  The songwriting is awesome!  You can feel the pain, confusion, and angst that the Beatles were going thru as they  <br />made the transition into being more mature songwriters.  This <br />album easily beats Sgt. Peppers in my book.  Get it!
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|After I read the news that BG will released live DVD from their own festival. I have been waiting this DVD and can't wait anymore when it released. This DVD is worth the waiting. The package and graphic is very great. The concert in disc 1 is very perfect. The screen, the sound, the feeling and the atmosphere make me impressed and would like to be there in the concert. And I love the contents in disc 2 also. As it show how the festival come to real. Great, great, great.
B000268QB2|5.0|I sampled this CD and bought it right away. I LOVE this CD, I've listened to it over 5 times now in 2 days of purchsing it. Its truely amazing how well produced and clear the sound of Keane resonates. Chaplin's enormous vocal range is very impressive and truely emotive. Each song tells a wonderfullly expressive story and the CD has an ageless quality to it that I haven't heard in a while from the new bands on the circuit. I was very impressed with this album and I'm eagerily awaiting a second from these chaps. I truely REFRESHING sound!
B0000028UK|5.0|I haven't heard all of Pearl Jam albums. I own \\"Ten\\", \\"Vitalogy\\", \\"Yield\\" and \\"Vs.\\" and this is my personal favorite, every song has a charge of musical energy that shows truly a brilliant and well-defined album. It has perfect examples of great grunge songs like \\"Go\\" \\"Animal\\" \\"Glorified G\\" \\"Rearviewmirror\\" \\"Leash\\" and \\"Rats\\" which is, in my opinion, the best song on this album...really good lyrics about the rat behavior and the music it's just astonishing, really good song. If you're new into Pearl Jam, try this, it is one of the finest pieces of rock music you're gonna find.
B00005JLEX|5.0|I am from Australia and I must say,,recently kramer was in Australia promoting the DVD and it was great to see him out of character and he was very funny. Also I LOVE SEINFELD,,No show ever or movie comes close to this show. The writers of this show are amazing. I just wish that even something half as funny as seinfeld would come out on tv. But sadly i dont think it is going to happen.  People say \\"friends\\" is as good as seinfeld or better,,and that is the most stupid statement ever. \\"friends has nothing on seinfeld..but only other show that comes CLOSE would be the fresh prince of bel-air but thats about it. Get the DVD,,you dont want to miss it!!
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana, one of the greatest band of the 90's, is relived throught this 14 track album. Although some of their better songs weren't on the album (including \\"Drain You\\", \\"Blew\\", or \\"Territorial Pissings\\") it still takes you through the life and words of frontman Kurt Cobain. This album can truly be appreciated because it opens the door to fans new to Nirvana and those who have had the experience of them. This album, with the previously unreleased song \\"You Know You're Right\\", is one of the best \\"greatest hits album\\" it really showcases the band with all its might with the heavy drums of Dave Grohl to the steady bass part of bassist Krist Novoselic to the fiery rage of Kurt Cobain.
B000002UC5|3.0|Paul McCartney's first solo work, truly a solo effort as he manages all the instruments and vocals, is also the weakest of his first four post-Beatles endeavors.  But this release might be better understood as a \\"signing of the death certificate\\" for what had become the 'now-defunct-greatest-rock-band ever'.  It's release came as  a surprise to many, although the seeds of discontent had been sown between John Lennon and McCartney years previous.  Being such a personal effort, keeping the album \\"under wraps\\" probably wasn't much of a challenge. <br /> <br />Despite his considerable talents, McCartney certainly would have been better off enduring some outside help on the album, particularly when it came to percussion.  Despite drumming being clearly revealed as Paul's Achilles heel, he boldly challenges his beat-challenged sensibility by closing out the album with 'Kreen -- Akrore', a percussion based excursion into a murky void of mantra-like vocalizations and heavy breathing better suited to a 1-900 phone call.  Other \\"songs\\" on the disc are clearly experimental, such as the instrumental 'Hot As Sun/Glasses', or brief, unfinished ditties such as 'The Lovely Linda'.  'Valentine Day' is another instrumental, but this one featuring an entertainingly heavy acoustic line.  'That Would Be Something' has a simplistic appeal to it, but is seemingly in need of 'something' before it really would be something.  In fact, one does not hit what seems to be a serious composition until track four, 'Every Night'. <br /> <br />Had McCartney wanted to release something with clear commercial merit, rather than a disc with controversial artistic appeal, he could have made his same statement of liberation with a four-track EP.  'Every Night', with it's fantastic acoustic guitar melody and passionate lead vocal, would have been a superb opener.  Two other tracks from the album, 'Oo You', a funky celebration of feminine sensuality, and the punching instrumental 'Momma Miss America', with its piano-based rhythm morphing into a scorching electric guitar solo, could follow.  The creme-de-la-creme would be McCartney's triumphant 'Maybe I'm Amazed' (amazingly never released as a solo until a live version with Wings rose to number one in 1977), a tune comparable in stature to 'Yesterday', featuring an ignited electric guitar and heartfelt vocal performance.  Now THAT disc John Lennon could not have convincingly panned, as he did the 'McCartney' album. <br /> <br />And John was right to pan the remainder of the tracks offered here.  'Junk' and its offspring 'Singalong Junk' are unremarkable instrumental pieces, and 'Teddy Boy' was a retreat into Beatles nostalgia, a reject from the 'Let It Be' sessions reminisient of 'Bungalo Bill' sans the tongue-in-cheek humor.  The general dearth of lyrical content renders the album difficult to listen to as a whole... after a few listens you'll probably be a frequent visitor to the 'skip' button, hunting down the more desirable tracks, the ones with real substance, which are interspersed like touchstones across the breadth of the album. <br /> <br />'McCartney' may also win the award for most ridiculous CD booklet.  Do we really need to grace the photo montage with a  pic of Paul picking his nose?  And how about the four seperate listings of the song titles, on the back insert, twice in the booklet, and once on the disc itself, none of which offer running-times for the individual tracks?  The cover is certainly unique though... and one can spend considerable time considering the symbolism of a bowl of apparently spilled cherries.  I've decided that for Paul and The Beatles, life's \\"bowl of cherries\\" had been upended, but that's just my interpretation. <br /> <br />'McCartney' has some valuable tracks, but only a performer of Paul's magnitude and import could get away with releasing an album containing so many tracks that are sub-par, by Paul McCartney standards.  The album is a must-have for Beatlemaniacs only, althoughit does claim historical significance and even interest as the first post-Beatles 'solo' work (disregarding George Harrison's 'Wonderwall', a solo album produced while the band was still a live entity).
0452285186|5.0|I came upon this little treasure when I was passing by a Lonon bookstore with my tour group from camp when one of the boys yelled, \\"OH MY GOD! I HAVE TO GET THIS!\\" and went diving into the store. I never got to read the whole thing, but I got it as soon as I found it back home and it has been worth the purchase. <br /> <br />As one reviewer said earlier, this is definitely for those with a twisted side, and for those who love such series as Lenore and The Far Side. It's a series of episodic cartoons about bunnies who basically are doing things to get themselves killed. Almost all of the methods are very creatively executed (pardon the pun), and many are ways nobody would ever think up if they wanted to die. <br /> <br />My personal favorite involves a tape of 'Fatal Attraction', but I'll leave that one for you to discover on your own.
B0002DRDBE|5.0|\\"Clerks\\" is one of the funniest movies ever made, and as such, it deserves the appropriate DVD edition. This 3-disc set is fully equipped with tons of extras and cool stuff. Disc one has the theatrical version with improved image quality and sound (Not perfect, being b&w, but it looks better than before) and extras like the short film \\"The Flying Car\\" featuring clerks Dante and Randal having a hilarious conversation about the flying car, the animated \\"lost scene\\" where you can see what really happened inside the funeral home, Jay & Silent Bob's MTV commercials, the cast auditions..... <br />Disc two has the first cut of the movie, like ten minutes longer but the image quality is really poor, it's fullscreen and very grainy, but it's great to see this deleted scenes never seen before..and the original ending. Dic three is all extras, a documentary about Kevin Smith and how he decided to make movies, Kevin and Scott Mosier's student film \\"Mae Day\\", ten year anniversary Q & A, interviews, Kevin Smith's journals, picture gallery. In conclusion, if you're a \\"Clerks\\" fan, this set is for you.
B00005JN4F|4.0|Taxi looks as though it would be a rediculous movie, and guess what, it is.  It's just so rediculous that it's funny!  The premise is completely absurd and that's what makes Taxi successful in being a validly funny comedy.  This movie doesn't try to be anything it's not. The premise of the movie is about an underdog cop who has issues with driving teaming up with a newly appointed taxi driver who isn't your run of the mill taxi driver.  Together they have to solve a big bank robbing case and redeem their reputations. Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah are both great in thier roles.  There are some pretty sweet car scenes in the movie also, I can't believe how decent they made a Crown Vic look.  If you're looking for a fun movie thats sure to provide some laughs than Taxi is for you.
B00024BHTC|4.0|The music of this record is maybe the most heaviest music in all nightwish discography, unfortunately Tarja's voice here is not good at all, she sings like a little tiny girl with no power on her voice as in Oceanborn. So because of that this is not the best album of the band. Oceanborn and Wishmaster are the best ones.
B000002KMV|2.0|I had the tape in high school when it first came out and  I bought the CD very recently for two songs in particular. The first, the title track, is a classic. The last track \\"Jack U Off\\" is a weird and wonderful mix of electro keyboards, New Wave-ish rhythms,  a sing-song melody, and incredibly raunchy lyrics. The remainder of the album is for me, forgetable.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I am going to make this short and sweet. This is a \\"play off\\" from what previous people have started to say about the set in this movie. I, personally, saw a little bit of symbolism in it. This movie, to me, showed the fakeness of everything and everyone around Nicole Kidman's character. I thought that the set was a very good effort on symbolism of that. The people were THAT simple, and, well...fake. Anyways, that's all I'm going to babble about that. This is a must-see film for everyone. You have to watch it at least once, it's very worth it.
B000002KBA|5.0|First off, I recommend the 25th Anniversary Edition of IN ROCK, simply for the bonus material and the improved sound quality. Before I played this 1970 album (Warner Bros. version) I was a Zeppelin and Sabbath fan, but after hearing this disc I realized, I'm more Purple, through and through. Maybe it's the keyboard angle or the consistently strong material that sets these guys apart. I see it as Deep Purple took the vibe and energy  of Elvis' Hound dog and flew it into the cosmos! A quick run down of the original album.<br /><br />Speed King: A great track, that is NOT a bit overrated. I can't believe I've never heard this on U.S. radio. What a crime against music, when such junk is played in it's place.<br /><br />Bloodsucker: A good album track. If this was any other hard rock band, it would be considered one of their greatest tracks.<br /><br />Child in Time: WOW! I had to hit the pause button after this epic. No wonder this one is considered a Deep Purple classic. Move over Ozzy and Plant, Gillan's passionate vocal delivery won me over.<br /><br />Flight of the Rat: After about three minutes of a relatively normal song structure, the organ, guitar and drums get solos. Amazing, it's a song like this, that puts DP on a different level for me.<br /><br />Into the Fire: A powerful track that makes most rock bands sound relatively tame.<br /><br />Living Wreck: The closet thing to a \\"normal\\" song. The organ growls away during the breaks. There seems to be no dropping the ball with this album.<br /><br />Hard Lovin' Man: My favorite song on the album. This one just drives along at full speed to conclude a amazing album.<br /><br />If you get the 25th Anniversary Edition, bonus tracks will follow like Black Night (re-mix) and Cry Free (re-mix) which are great additions.<br /><br />Blackmore, Lord, Glover, and Paice all have tremendous skill with their instruments, and Gillian is a great rock singer. These guys were ahead of their time, with one of the greatest hard rock album of all time. In Rock may sound dated but so does Hendrix, Cream and all the others from the late sixties and early seventies. This album topped the UK charts for a year and influenced a generation of Metal bands.<br /><br />In conclusion, extremely strong musicianship, amazing vocals, wild solos and of course the \\"tongue in cheek\\" attitude which makes this style of rock music digestible.the greatest hard rock album of all time.

B0001ADAVK|1.0|The theme of this movie is that women should be able to have it all:  to have a career, a home, a husband, and children.  In the 2000's women try to juggle all these things and be Superwomen!  We haven't gained anything in the past 50 years as women, we've just increased our workload!
6305364648|3.0|As for the movie, I love it!  I think it's one of Arnold's most entertaining films.  Another plus about this dvd release is the use of 2.35 aspect ratio.  Now for the bad news, the people at Fox pictures apparently didn't care enough about this release to clean the film before they burned it to dvd, which is obvious while watching it.  It has those annoying dust specs, that you many times see while watching movies in the theaters.  I literally own two hundred dvds and I've never seen such an enormous amounts of these specs that it actually distracted me from the movie, but that is truly the case here.    I am currently looking for an older dvd release of this movie that maintains the same ratio, but doesn't have the dust specs.  It may sound like I'm being too picky, but trust me when I say that they grow annoying and a person shouldn't have put up with them after paying for a brand new dvd.  I give the movie a rating of 5 stars, but lower my rating because of Fox Movies poor workmanship.    By the way, the visual problems aren't limited to annoying dust specs.  In addition I noticed a scene in this film where this white blob (about the diameter of two of my thumbs together) appear on the screen next to Arnold Schwarzenegger's head during the film for about one half second.  I'm 90% confident that these errors are present throughout the film, but became annoyed enough not to watch the movie all the way through.  I'm considering writing a complaint to Fox Movies, and I suggest that all you fans of the genre do the same.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Alright for the most part this is a failry decent movie and attack on Bush. I myself support Bush but i still saw this movie to see the other side. There are a few moments where the film got funny when Bush was first in office and they asked him what hes goin to do and he responds \\" Well you'll see im singing stuff and making some decisions, you'll see.\\" Now that got me cracking up, but while he was firts in office there realy is not a lot you can do ohter then sit there so i dont blame the man. <br /> <br />  However when Bush found out abut the attacks while he was in that classroom he did just sit there when he found out, yet by his face expresions he appeared to be in shock. Perosnally i thnk anyone would be also. He did not look to intrested in reading that book anymore and appeared he was thinking on what he could do. Now This movie was only made for Bush to look bad and there are plenty of good things to say about the guy, even tho this war in Iraq is complete crap, at least let Bush finish what he started and not let Kerry take over and try to finish it becuase that will lead toa failed mission. <br /> <br />  I still support President Bush this movie only shows the bad, well if i were anyoen also look at the flip side because im sure there is a lot of good just not seen. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
0375751513|5.0|The greatest marriage of classic literature and modern philosophy, poetry masquerading as prose, and a psychological epic in art-house clothing ever created!  The genius of Oscar Wilde knew no bounds, and this book remains disturbingly chilling and alarmingly familiar over a hundred years after its first controversial publication. Though the plot could never exist anywhere outside of fiction, it is at once starkly shocking and believeable, never once wavering from the quietly accusing mood set early on.<br /><br />Dorian Gray is a beautiful youth who becomes painter Basil Hallward's artistic obsession, and the masterpiece painting Basil creates of Dorian seems to mock the young man, who grows jealous of the fact that it will never grow old or ugly, as he knows he will. He silently curses the painting and wishes it would age instead of him, and eerily enough, the painting becomes in itself a picture of Dorian's vain, ugly, hedonistic, and murderous soul.<br /><br /> Indelibly true and deliciously quirky, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a treasure trove of genius observations and statements so true and yet so stunning you'll be forced to look over it a second time, just to make sure you didn't miss any of Wilde's poignant words. Well worth your time and energy, this book is reason enough to fake sick from school or work so you'll have the extra time to read it.
0385512104|4.0|When Christopher, an autistic, bright and remote 15-year old boy, decides to investigate the death (by garden fork!) of Wellington, a next-door poodle, he discovers secrets about his family that upset his entire life. <br /> <br />Because Christopher has to work at understanding emotion, the poignancy of the situation is sublte, never overpowering.  The book is told in the form of Christopher's journal, which is engaging and often funny.  The reader will understand a lot of things about Christopher's world long before he does... we know early on, for example, that the father has been lying about the mother's death, and we see that Christopher's inability to sense human emotion (lies, hesitation) keeps him in the dark about motivation, though he is so observant to detail that the world overwhelms him. <br /> <br />Christopher has to learn by heart, and the difficult way, such fundamental rules as \\"do not hit fellow students.\\"  It's not that Christopher is unemotional-- he's overwhelmed by it in fact. <br /> <br />Christopher ends up taking a harrowing journey to London, which as described is an enormous feat of will.  He's an unusual hero but a hero all the same.   <br /> <br />The short chapters and matter-of-fact style of the book make this a quick read.  The book is hard to put down, and Christopher's take on the world is haunting.
0671027387|4.0|I found the begining of this book to be a bit slow, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down.  Brown is incredibly imaginative.  Almost the entire story takes place in one day, and it is just amazing how much happens to the characters.  Like every good thriller, not all of the likeable characters are good and not all of the unlikeable characters are bad.  Brown definitely keeps the reader guessing until the very end.  This book is well worth the read.
B0000931QR|2.0|I am sorry, but there can only ever be one \\"Mecano\\" and one Ana Torroja.  This group is obviously a wannabe Mecano.  They are trying to free ride off of the success that Mecano had in the 80's and 90's with their very unique style of music, metaphorical and deep lyrics, and Ana's very angelic voice.  In fact, I on couple of occasions mistakened Amaia, or whatever her name is', voice for la increible Ana.  No compren esta cd!!!! Its not original enough!
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Who says this falls short of its predecessor! I'd say it in fact trumps the first Bourne cameo with a tighter plot, a lower body count, and just as many edge-of-the-seat jolts.<br /><br />The pivotal car chase in the movie tops most in memory, reminiscent of Ronin but set all over the world, from the unfeeling fields of Goa to the narrow streets of Berlin.<br /><br />The villain is unmasked quickly this time round, but this isn't a whodunit; it's a howdunit, keeping us riveted as we watch Bourne stay one step behind a solution and one step ahead of authorities.<br /><br />The action sequences are fascinating, including a very creative deployment of a toaster as a deadly weapon in one particularly thrilling sequence.<br /><br />Top notch stuff!
068987474X|5.0|This is a slim book, but it's so funny and so dead-on that it's worth the money.      What woman hasn't wished to keep a relationship with a man as arrogant and irresponsible as the reviewer who \\"blames\\" women  by reinterpreting the man's nastiness or unresponsiveness in the best possible light?  Once we fall in love, we want that love to work.    But ladies... it takes two to make love work.  And as Behrendt keeps pointing out, men hate to give women bad news, so they waffle.  But when the man reallyIS in love... it's very clear.    I admit, I fell in love with someone and made excuses for him because when he first was in love with me, he did do all those things Behrendt said a guy will do-- he called, he made the effort, he pursued, he was attentive.  So rather than paying attention to the change in his behavior... I made excuses.  Which is illogical, because I knew that he IS perfectly capable of calling, emailing, showing up, because he'd done it in the past.    We all want to be loved.  But when we try to fit a man-not-in-love into the -in-love slot, it doesn't fit, and we end up hurt.    This book ends up being a great laugh-- I had to read a lot of it out loud to friends-- and a self-esteem booster, too.      Liz occasionally tries to argue with Greg-- so you don't feel that he just doesn't understand women, because Liz is right there.    the \\"faux letter\\" and answer format is totally engaging.      It's a keeper!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is a complete and total atrocity to the American way of life. It gives you a complete \\"documentary\\" filled with lies about our leader. This movie is just the liberal way of interpretting everything in this world, placing the blame on everything that is wrong in the world on Republicans. Micheal Moore is to the democrats what Leni Riefentstahl was to the Nazis. For those of you who do not know who Riefenstahl was, she was the director of Triumph of Will, the biggest Nazi propaganda film of all times. Michael Moore shows President George W Bush to be someone who does not know what he is doing. It shows scenes of President Bush before he was president and claims that it was scenes of him on vacation during his presidency.  Obviously Bush did go on vacation during his presidency, but he also used some of his vacation to go and visit wounded soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyone who believes what this movie has to say should be considered some of the most uneducated and Unamerican people that this country has. Showing half truths and partial statements, claiming that these statements are the full truth is not entertainment, it is an insult to the film industry. This movie is the worse movie that I have ever heard of, let alone the worst movie I have seen.
B000002H2H|5.0|Lots of people throw around 5 star ratings, and, as a result, they've come to mean almost nothing. This, however, is an album that DESERVES five stars. <br /> <br />Ride the Lightning opens with Fight Fire with Fire, which is probably the hardest song on the album; a short neoclassical opener gets ripped open by a lightning fast thrashfest. This is probably the highlight of the album for Lars, who drums at impossible speeds to support a crushing rhythm guitar. Hetfield's vocals are unique to this album and the first; although he's obviously far too old to have voice breaks, his singing is still permeated by a distinctively teenage shriek that compliments the frenetic speed of the album quite well. <br /> <br />The second song, which is also the title track, is somewhat less hard that the first, but not a single bit less intense. The opening guitar is also done with somewhat higher notes, which lends itself to the panicking feel of the song. James actually sounds desperate when he screams 'Someone help me/Oh please, God help me!', and, although the solo isn't quite as outstanding as on other songs, it holds its own. <br /> <br />The psychotic thrash gives way to a slower, almost Sabbath-esque form of metal that is nonnetheless just as hard as the first song in For Whom the Bell Tolls. There's an ominously slow crunch to this song which returns later on track seven, and Hetfield's lyrics are a bit wordier to add to the epic feel. This song's only problem is that it isn't long enough; it fades to an early (albeit great) outtro, and seems to be cut short. <br /> <br />The slower pace of track three aids with consistency and lets into Fade to Black, Metallica's first ballad. Not much can be said about this song; listen to it! <br /> <br />The fifth song on this album is Trapped Under Ice. This song is the most similar to the first. It starts out a bit slow to heat up from the previous song, but then flies headfirst into a blistering thrash assault containing THREE SOLOS.Superb! <br /> <br />Escape is the second softest song on Ride the Lightning, with an almost cheerful chorus to bring us back to life after Fade to Black's suicide lament. This is the closest thing this album has to a weak song, but a bit of what is almost power metal shows at the lines 'See them try to bring the hammer down/No damn chains can hold me to the ground!'. <br /> <br />The last vocal song on this CD is Creeping Death. The subject matter is as epic as the music, drawing on the story of the ten plagues of Egypt. I mean, really -- what complements an album about death more that the idea of a 'Death Angel'? Early on it's thrash with inspired song writing. After a superb solo by  Kirk Hammett, we're treated to a lumbering, thunderous interlude followed by hair-raising vocals and the effect of several dozen people chanting 'Die! Die! Die!' in the background. The song wraps up at an even pace and fades to an excellant outro. <br /> <br />The last song on the album is Call of the Ktulu. Like Fade to Black, there's not much that can be said about this song; you just have to hear it.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|There was a 1983 made-for-tv film called THE DAY AFTER about the nuclear holocaust. The \\"creative team\\" behind this current film decided to tack on '...TOMORROW' at the end. Thus, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is the name of the film almost in the same ballpark of humans on the verge of being destroyed by a disaster. The 1983 film, to reiterate, was about a pre and post nuclear attack brought on by other humans.  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is about the onset of a new ice age out to destroy mankind which is a natural disaster. Nothing new here except that digital special effects can do anything in spectacular fashion. Therefore it allows the viewer to suspend disbelief and see if the characters of the film and the whole human race in general can survive this catastrophe.  This is a rehash of ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE CORE,DEEP IMPACT, EARTHQUAKE with a slight new twist. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a pure popcorn summer action disaster movie. However, it is not very memorable story wise or character wise and the film will probably leave the viewer feeling empty and cold (no pun intended!). Lastly, the creators could have come out with a more inventive title. It sounds more closely to the recent inane James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) film titles (TOMORROW NEVER DIES, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, DIE ANOTHER DAY ...).
B00003CXCT|4.0|The fondest memories of my childhood are all rooted in the Star Wars Trilogy - the original versions.  I give the original versions of the films 5 stars, as well as the special features on the new DVD.  The recut versions, however, are disappointing.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Know before reading the content of my review that I have nothing to prove by liking Sigur Ros. I live in a town of about 100 people in Alaska, and there are no indie rock snobs around here to name-drop with. So labels like \\"art-rock\\" and \\"ambience\\" really mean nothing to me. The most poular group around here is Linkin Park. That said, I love this band with an intensity I have never known for a band before. Like any great band, Sigur Ros has inspired a lot of people to jump on their bandwagon. It is my hope to avoid that in this review. Trust me-Sigur Ros is a religion, based on love, beauty, and acceptance. The fact that four men can get together and make music as beautiful and soulful as this reaffirms my faith in the human race. My question is: when will they come to Alaska? It's not unlike Iceland up here and we're certainly in need of good shows.
B000002MY3|4.0|I love Alanis Morissette. She hasn't released a wholly bad album in her entire career. This was pretty much the first album I really got into as a kid. And her Jagged Little Pill tour was the first concert I ever went to. But now I'm 16. So. Now that I'm done complimenting, let's face the harsh reality: Alanis has undergone [apparently] a LOT of development since this album. I haven't listened to her early stuff in years. Well I just dug it up recently....and though I remember the great beats and catchy hooks I adored as a kid......I'm realizing an enormous flaw in this album....Alanis's voice is AWFUL. And in some points....I mean screaming howling dying cat awful.....I was literally listening to the adlib in \\"All I Really Want,\\" laughing hysterically. I began to think, \\"um....is she TRYING to sound this horrible...?\\" Alanis eventually develops a beautiful voice, as heard on So-Called Chaos, but it is painfully obvious that this was made during her early years. The songs here, however, are undeniably infectious; so much so that in the points where Alanis's voice becomes aggravating you won't care because the music rules here. And there *are* moments where she actually sings rather well-\\"Forgiven\\" is sung very well, and it is also one of my favorite songs here. \\"Mary Jane\\" is also another well-sung track. \\"Head Over Feet,\\" \\"Ironic,\\" and the smash \\"You Oughta Know\\" are other classic tracks here. I can't deny the flaws: there are points where Alanis's voice gets REALLY weak ad downright bad. Yes, though there is very strong language, to this day the album is label-free. Yes, the album's feel is quite angry and man-hating (but there's more upbeat tracks like \\"Hand In My Pocket\\" and \\"You Learn\\"). But what's nice about Jagged Little Pill is that musically, it rocks. And like Avril Lavigne's first album, there is NO filler here. Any one of these tracks could have become a radio hit. To this day, one of her most consistently good albums-maybe her best ever. A necessity ifyou are a fan of hers.
068987474X|2.0|Come on girls... think with your heads! The problem we women have is that we think too much with our hearts, and we stop seeing what's right in front of us. Maybe if we woke up collectively, books like this wouldn't have to be written. Having said all that, the book was well-written, but for what I paid for it, I expected it to last more than 4 hours (which is what it took me to finish it). If you've been through the married man, the man that will never get married again, the relationship with no passion, and any variations of the aforementioned, I think you will find this book not quite as interesting as many of the readers do.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|I saw Ninja Scroll on a whim several years ago and I was blown away.  It was the first anime movie that I ever saw, so I had no idea that animated features could be so impressive.  The characters were amazing and diverse.  The film had funny instances at times and it was deeply engaging.  I was stunned with a new respect for anime.
B00005JMXX|4.0|Roland Emmerich has this reputation of creating this huge blockbuster disaster films like Independence Day and to a lesser extent Godzilla. Yet we critically forget his 2 finest films: Stargate and the Patriot. It's been 8 years since ID4 and he again destroys the world(and New York for the 3rd time) but it's more spectacular than that despite logic and dialogue. <br /> <br />Jack Hall(why is main characters always Jack for some reason?) is a paleoclimatologist which means he studys the weather that exists 1000's of years ago. He says that melting ice caps will disrupt the climate flow which means we'll enter a new ice age. Of course, no one believes him, including a Dick Cheney look-alike. And he still doesn't believe him afterwards. But soon, Scotland is hit with a hurricane where the eye of it is -150 F and instantly freezes you in about 7 seconds. Hail the size of footballs crash into Tokyo. Tornadoes ravage Los Angeles and a massive tsunami hits New York and then freezes, blanketing the Big Apple in snow. <br /> <br />Come for the effects if you have to. My favorite scene is probably the tsunami hitting New York even though it has an incredibly lame tension builder(super cute Emmy Rossum goes back to a cab when the tsunami is blocks away to get....a bag? Whatever). The LA tornadoes are next where you have those annoying newscasters right in the middle of a disaster reporting when they should get out of here getting nailed by LA's favorite billboard, Angeline. Some CG isn't that great: the wolves don't look realistic and for some reason the New York tsunami wave looks a bit too dark while Deep Impact's wave(also hitting New York) was in broad daylight. <br /> <br />Don't come here expecting to get research for a paper. The chances of it happening that fast is really stretching it and don't ask me to explain the science of certain things like the idea of the super-freezing hurricane. Like the Core, it's awesome and cool to behold but your brain should be off as to not end up spending the entire movie figuring out the science of it. But still, go for the effects...and Emmy Rossum.
0440224764|5.0|John Grisham surely knew what he was doing when he wrote this book. This book is a classical example for a \\"John Grisham\\" thriller. The way he builds up the story is amazing and I've never seen something like it before. He starts with a story about a person named Patrick and then rolls the story to the point where we find out who he is and why he was captured to the point where the \\"legal stuff\\" starts. A great book, Very much recommended!
B0001I561E|5.0|This is the tale of a street thief named \\"Aladdin\\" who falls in love for the beautiful princess Jasmine, he discovers a magic lamp with a witty Genie to grant him three wises including him to make him a prince, and must defeat the evil sorcerer Jafar.<br /><br />This movie is the most spectacular movie of 1992, the higest grossing movie of that year and a instant classic for it's great disney animation, some groundbreaking effects, a sharp sense of humor from the Genie played by Robin Williams, Gilbert Godfried whom is perfect as Jago the Parrot, and great songs by Howard Ashman & Alan Menken such as the memorable \\" A whole new world\\".<br /><br />The 2-Disc DVD set is amazing with awesome extras like commentary, featurettes, fun games, behind the scenes on how this remarkable animated movie was made, still-and-art gallery, publicity and more makes this a definite must buy for your DVD collection, highly recommended.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say this is my favorite Britney album. She is totally amazing. Though \\"In The Zone\\" is not the strongest song on the album it is definitely my favorite. Her duet with Madonna is amazing. The CD showcases her vocal range beautiful and mixes a whole bunch of styles together - from pop to techno to r&b to hip hop. I recommend anyone that likes Britney to have this in their collection!
B00005JMXX|1.0|This is about as bad as it gets.  Disaster movies, in this day and age, just aren't entertaining.  Especially one as boring and unbelievable as this one. <br /> <br />Millions dead and New York gets destroyed.  Oh, except for Dennis Quaid and his ugly son.  They somehow find each other against all odds.  I want my two hours back!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|When I stumble on an artist that is new to me but really catches my attention, I usually want to hear more of their work or do some research on them before I open the wallet.  However, when I walked into a music store yesterday and heard this incredible version of Dance Me to the End of Love being played, I immediately asked who the singer is    <br /> <br />I was not familiar with Natalie Peyroux, other than by name. But I said this is all I need to hear.  This is a \\"must have\\" disk.  Listening to the rest of it hasn't dampened the enthusiasm.  <br /> <br />Hopefully, Ms. Peroux will build on this effort and not keeping us waiting very long for a follow-up.  I, and many others, will certainly be waiting.
B000068IEU|2.0|I'm a fan of 70s exploitation and horror movies, I like Wes Craven's films (especially the Hills Have Eyes, People Under the Stairs and the first Nightmare on Elm Street) and I'm even a fan of David Hess, so this movie should be right up my alley. But you know what? <br /> <br />It's boring. The rape and torture scenes are no even remotely as \\"shocking\\" or \\"transgressive\\" as some reviewers would have you believe... if anything, most of those scenes are alluded to and take place off-screen. \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" (\\"Last House\\"'s closest relative) is much more graphic and disturbing in its handling of similar scenes. And the revenge violence is fairly uncreative (apart from the oral Bobbit scene -- that was alright!) and didn't feature much gore.  <br /> <br />In other words, it's not as gory or frightening as many similar horror movies, and it's not as graphic or transgressive as many other exploitation movies. Unfortunately, it features all of the bad acting, ham-handed cinematography, corny soundtrack and overall low production values you'd expect in this kind of movie.  <br /> <br />IMO this movie gets a LOT of undue praise. \\"House by the Edge of the Park\\" by Ruggero Deodato (also featuring David Hess) is much more graphic and delivers the goods; if you're looking for a video nasty, I'd recommend that instead.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|The movie was great - and this CD is incredible!  Even inside the dust jacket the movie's director said that it was this collection of music that totally made the movie the success it is.  Just take a listen and you'll know why.  Great music for a romantic dinner - or even as low-key background mood for hanging out or an evening with friends.   The only thing that is a little out of place are the two christmas songs (one of which is especially wonderful) at the end...
1401301010|3.0|As a tremendous fan of Kiedis and the Red Hots since nearly their beginning, I was eager to pick up this book to see master Anthony's personal view of his experiences with a myriad of trauma and difficulty. Already knowing much about Kiedis, I expected to get a much more insightful look at him. Like other readers have mentioned, i knew that it would be rife with drug and sexual banter, but i was a bit disgusted that this made up 85% of the book! The drug bits are understandable and interesting, but i was taken aback by the sexual references. Must we really know the particulars about EVERY single conquest? Okay Anthony, you've proven yourself a man's man, but superfluous amounts of filth really knocks down both my opinion of him and the novel. He describes being a 25 year old man, and meeting and falling in love with a 15 year old, who he went on to have a brief engagement with. Though nothing is quite as grotesque as his graphic description of an encounter with a 14 year old girl. Aside from all that, some interesting insight is garnered from his accounts of early band members and recording their albums.
0066620996|5.0|Why settle for \\"good enough\\" if there is a potential to be \\"great\\"? I thoroughly enjoyed this book by Jim Collins because it clearly states a research objective, shows how the data was gathered and draws thoughtful conclusions. But, Good To Great ultimately challenges you -- the reader -- to draw conclusions of your own based on the overall information.  <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the \\"First Who, Then What\\" concept where companies are encouraged to \\"Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not your biggest problems.\\"  As a business owner, this book challenged me to look back over my own career. <br /> <br />By JoAnna Carey, Author of Rat Race Relaxer: Your Potential & The Maze of Life
0897500482|5.0|I have to say this is one of the most insightful books i have ever read. another review before mine says \\"the book says to throw it out after you read it\\"; this does not literally mean to throw out the book, it is merely a metaphor. What the book actually says is to \\"when you fully understand this book discard it\\" meaning don't rely on the book to determine your actions and personal development, rather learn form it book and develop your own style, not copy Bruce's action and style word for word.This book is not determined to be an instructional \\"how to fight\\" type of book, but rather a book of educational, psycological, and physical understanding.  <br />I highly recommend this book for beginning martial artists, and the veterans of the arts.
B00030590I|5.0|This summer, with movies like I Robot, Sky Captain, and AVP, all of which are pretty good, but nothing spectacular, I was wondering if there would actually be a \\"best movie of the year\\". Over the past three years, we've been spoiled by the Lord of the Rings movies, but with that over, we'll just have to except the fact that there's not going to be another spectacular epic this December. So with LOTR gone, what will be the \\"best movie of the year\\"? I think I found that out on August 27th with the release of Hero, a Chinese martial arts epic from the producer of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. I first discovered Hero in a preview before I Robot. My reaction was: \\"Hey, that looks cool!\\" Closer to the release date, I started to see articles in the paper discussing the movie, each making me more and more interested. Finally, on the 27th of August, I read the four-star review in the tribune, and decided to see it myself. <br /> <br /> Enough with that, on to my opinion. Hero is definitely the best movie since Return of the King, and if you pretend that wasn't made, it's the best movie of the century! The story, the visuals, the fights, it's more than you could ask for in a movie of any genera! To be polite, Hero completely blows Crouching Tiger, and Enter the Dragon (my other two favorite Martial Arts movies) 10,000 feet out of the water! (I won't ever bother comparing Hero to Hollywood trash like The Matrix.) Just a warning: if your dumb (like 99% of the population), this isn't the movie for you. This is an intellectual movie that makes you think to the point of almost going insane just trying to figure out what the heck is going on. But if you have a good sized brain, you'll be able to sit back, relax, and enjoy this great movie. Buy it today. When you do, your in for one heck of an epic thrill ride.

B000002C25|4.0|Personally i feel this album has not got its just deserves. I am a huge Oasis fan and although not quite as good as Whats the Story morning glory, it certianly comesa close. Nearly all the tracks are superb with stand by me, i hope i think i know, dont go away and all around the world taking the front line. This album is great to listen to and was unfailry snubbed by all those set-in-their-way alternative music fans who think its cool to hate Oasis. A legend of an album by a legend of a band. Peace out.

B0002MB7QW|2.0|\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is one of those dime-a-dozen films that hardly has an element in it that stands out from the pack. It has no individuality and very little appeal. And yet, for some silly reason, the makers thought they had a justifiable reason to give the public another 'disaster' film.  <br /> <br />It seems the producers of this film and countless others, feel that indulging in special effects makes up for shallowness in just about every other aspect of film. The concept of the world rapidly reverting to another ice-age and the catastrophic consequences is an interesting enough idea, yet the film fails. With characters that hardly have any depth, a standard script and a relatively flat storyline, \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is strictly a special effects film with very little substance.  The special effects, thankfully are good, but the lack of care the audience has for the characters, and the not entirely believable events that play out, make this a very average film.  <br /> <br />Don't expect much at all.
B000002JS6|5.0|Hard Rock doesn't get better than this. This is the AC/DC <br />first album with Brian Johnson and it is EASILY the best <br />he did with the band. The greatest tracks here are Hells <br />Bells/Shook me all night Long/Back in Black/Shoot to Thrill <br />and it has underrated songs like Have a drink on me and <br />Rock n Roll ain't noise pollution. If you are just now <br />getting into Hard Rock this should be the first place <br />to start. <br /> <br />You Shook Me All Night Long <br />Hells Bells <br />Black In Black <br />Shoot To Thrill <br /> <br />Those are the 4 headliners.

B000089RVX|1.0|I did listen to some of this but I just can't get by the  lead singers HORRIBLE voice. I can't even tell if the rest  of the band is any good because the vocals turned me off  so bad. Vocals isn't always the high on my list as I can  SOMETIMES look past lack luster vocals IF the rest is good,  but it just shows how bad \\"Amy Lee\\" really is at singing.   She really needs another job. Well, she makes money off   of misguided teens so I guess she is doing fine money   wise.    Honestly, I've never been so turned off by a singers voice  to the point to that I can't even tell if the rest of the  band is any good. Unbelieveable. Maybe it's just that I'm  not into the goth stuff... But whatever... Just don't like  it.

0375507256|5.0|This is one book where I honestly can't wait for the movie version, as author David Mitchell has a cinematic sense of narrative that juggles with time like a Quentin Tarantino and sprawls vividly amid exotic locations like a David Lean. This would be an impressive achievement even for the most accomplished writer, much less one as relatively new to the literary scene as Mitchell, as he interweaves six individual stories, each one set in a unique time and locale, into amazingly, one cohesive novel. The discrete stories are told in parts and sometimes out of order, but they tie together through intersections, coincidences and the clever notion that every central character is a reincarnation of a previous character. Perhaps that concept borders on being contrived, but somehow the ploy works beautifully due to Mitchell's full-blooded commitment to his themes. Spanning times, continents and cultures, Mitchell focuses on the follies that would subjugate humanity - slavery, corporate greed, and of nationalistic politics.<br /><br />The utterly nonlinear novel begins with the 18th-century diary of Adam Ewing, a San Francisco notary who is traveling by ship in the South Pacific (story #1). Story #2 follows in 1931 when a sexually indecisive, aspiring composer named Robert Frobisher serves as amanuensis to an older, more accomplished composer. Story #3 jumps to the 1970's where a reporter named Luisa Rey investigates a cover-up at a nuclear reactor (think of Karen Silkwood), and Story #4 focuses on a 60-ish book editor named Tim Cavendish who finds himself accidentally imprisoned in a home for the elderly. A near-future vision of Korea is the setting of story #5 where a genetically engineered ''fabricant'' named Sonmi-451 is interrogated for her crime of wanting to be fully human, and finally, story #6, the most devastating of all, a Hawaiian ruminates on a post-apocalyptic life. Mitchell is particularly strong in describing the Hawaiian landscape, populated by primitives, tribal warfare and brutal violence. Somni returns here as God for the tribesman protagonist Zachry. Then all the unfinished stories are completed in backward order, a creative stroke at once maddening and fulfilling.<br /><br />Through birth, death and rebirth, Mitchell raises some tough questions that give the reader pause. This is a dense work driven by an appropriately dark vision, and one could certainly get caught up in the plot convolutions if a full commitment is not made to the audacious concept he has presented here. The title of this book is apt, as this is a map of ever-changing clouds alternately revealing and hiding a world that evolves on common paths. Make sure to concentrate when you read this complex book because it's a winner for the patient among us.fare and brutal violence. Somni returns here as God for the tribesman protagonist Zachry.

B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers by the Rolling Stones is probably the bands best,  though Let it Bleed and Exile on Main St are both very strong.  The album kicks off with a classic rock classic Brown Sugar,  which contains what i think is Keiths greatest and most memorable  riff. Sway is next and is somewhat of a lost gem, a really good  rocker, slow tempo, and you never really hear about that one.  Wild Horses is one of the bands greatest ballads, and contains some really great acoustic playing, and top notch vocals by Mick and Keith.  Can't You Hear Me Knocking is a great rocker,containing stellar jagged riffing and rough vocals, and with an extended jazz solo by Mick Taylor and Keith to close out the song. You Got to Move is a slow blues stomp B!+ch rocks too, with its tight riffing and excellent horn arrangements.  I Got the Blues is a slow soul jam, and Dead Flowers is country junkie music and very cool, with a nice chorus and guitar solo.  Sister Morphine is an erie sounding song about a patient who needs the morphine badly, and cousin cocaine makes a guest appearanceif you know what I mean. The albums closer Moonlight Mile is an exotic ballad with some eastern sounding string arrangements, and is one of the only Stones songs that Keith doesnt play on, although he wrote the music.  As A whole the album is one of the top five rock albums ever, i think.  If you like the Stones or blues and rock buy this album.  You wont regret it, an all time classic rock album by the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World: the Rolling Stones.
006441034X|5.0|I started searching for this book because Hayao Miyazaki is releasing his new animation based on it.  After reading some of the reviews from this website I decided to give a try and bought the book.  Before I open the book, I only thought of it as a guide for the movie that I want to see. But after reading the first chapter, I couldn't put the book down and finished it in one day. Jones is a wonderful story teller that gave her characters life and personality within the story. The characters are far more interesting than the Harry Potter series and they made me laugh so hard while reading it. It's easy reading aiming at the teen group, but as an adult myself, it's a great short reading to escape from the busy reality.  However, I do agree that the ending is a bit abrupt.

B00028HBKM|5.0|With this film Mel Gibson provides the first accurate portrayal of the suffering of Christ as described in the Bible. This film is an absolute \\"Must-See\\" for anyone interested in the life of Jesus Christ. HE died for all of our sins (past, present, future) for every person in the world as we can see and hear clearly in the message of this \\"historical\\" cinematic document. Now it's no longer a sin issue, but instead it's a Christ issue: do I accept Him as my personal Savior or do I reject His finished work on the cross? <br />Yes, the portrayal is brutal and it's a bloody affair, but that's how it was and Christ's blood was shed to pay the high price for all of our sins to redeem us and provide Eternal Life for whosoever believes in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. <br />The film is in the original languages which adds to the effectiveness of this film and with the combination of the vivid images Mel Gibson seems to bring the attentive viewer to the actual places as if a bystander at the events. Much attention has been given to all the details and it's a motion picture for the whole family. Aside from the true historic events, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a tremendous cinematic achievement. <br />We can thank Mel Gibson for going out by faith and putting up his own money to finance this film and for doing excellent research and sticking to the vision to bring the last few hours of Christ closer to many millions of people and to introduce them to a living faith in Jesus Christ.
B00030590I|5.0|It is great to find one of those rare movies that has a great story and is so captivating, enjoyable, and creative. <br /> <br />This is the story of a Chinese hero (played by Jet Li) who is brought before the emperor to tell of his exploits.  The emperor doubts the original story the hero gives and gives his own interpretation of how events unfolded.  The hero then retells the correct story. <br /> <br />In other words, the story is told three times.  While this sounds like it Groundhogs Day reincarnated, it is far from that in that each version is completely different from each other and doesn't have you sitting there going, \\"Oh, no, not again.\\"  The story grabs you and keeps you interested.  In fact, at the end of the movie I found myself wishing for more. <br /> <br />As with similar movies in this genre; Hidden Tiger, Couching Dragon and Iron Monkey; the martial arts in this movie is phenomenal... though some of it is rather comical. <br /> <br />If you liked movies like the ones just listed you will find yourself loving this movie.  I think this one is even better because you've got the story telling imagination of Quentin Tarantino to help things along.  Highly recommended even if you aren't into martial arts because of the excellent story that is told.

B00001OH1S|3.0|I found the solo saxophone rendition of \\"Windmills..\\" spellbinding while watching the movie in my home theatre.  So much so, I bought the Soundtrack.  However, that version of the song is not on the CD.  Why?  Sting's version, which was sung over the opening credits of the 1999 movie (similar to the 1968 version) is terrific.  I do not understand why the sax version and other songs were cut from this CD.

B000059Z8J|4.0|Forget a review of the content. Its a classic, and we all know it. Christopher Reeve was able to portray both Kent and Superman as humane and realistic, and its still the best Comic-to-Movie in it's humor, humanity and epic scale.<br /><br />The DVD quality is very good-I feel like its a brand new film. The special effects have worn with age, but you can't get Reeve's acting with a digital CG hero. Color, sound and clarity haven't been this good since it was released.<br /><br />Some additional sequences were added, and most fit in very well. One, in particular, is a glaring mistake. It is wooden and makes Superman and Brando look silly. Superman confesses his taste for fame in the fortress of solitude, and Brando waxes on about politics and ego. Its really an oddball addition and needs to be burned. With Reeve standing there looking for a hug from Jor-El and whining.<br /><br />Otherwise, the additional content was fitting and adds extra flavor to a movie which originally dedicated nearly an hour to Superman's origin. The origin was out of scale to the faster pace of the second half, but the new footage gives the second half more weight.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Many people identify this as the greatest rock documentary ever made. I'm not sure it quite deserves that label (my vote would go for the older T.A.M.I. film, which has not yet been made available on DVD), but it is certainly the most interesting and frightening. Clearly it started off as a documentary of the Stones 1969 tour of the United States (which I believe was their first U.S. tour following the death of Brian Jones and his being replaced by Mick Taylor), but everything changed once Altamount happened. The death of Meredith Hunter at the hands of a member of the Hell's Angels, who had been employed to maintain security at the free concert the Stones gave in San Francisco, takes over the film, changing it from a documentary about the Stones on tour to a murder that took place at a Stones concert.<br /><br />Until about half way through the documentary, the film is still primarily a documentary about the Stones. But once the cameras get to Altamount, the crew (which included as a cameraman young filmmaker George Lucas, though none of Lucas's film was included in the film due to a camera jam) catches the increasingly nasty atmosphere at the concert, with fans ascending the stage, fighting with the Hell's Angels, fighting with each other. The Grateful Dead, scheduled to play, declined to do so when they heard that Marty Balin of the Jefferson Airplane had been beaten up onstage by the Angel's (we see a brief shot of Jerry Garcia reacting incredulously to the news of the violence). By the end of the film, the viewer is left with a completely sickened feeling of the stupidity of everything he or she has just seen.<br /><br />The violence completely obscures the fact that the Stones were at the time precisely what the announcer at the beginning of the film announces: the world's greatest rock and roll band. The performances, especially the earlier ones in the film, but also in the raw tape of songs like \\"Brown Sugar,\\" are stunningly good, and it is especially apparent the new great guitar edge that Mick Taylor has brought to the band (Jones brought an across the board brilliance, and could add everything from slide guitar to upright piano to sitar to the mix, but was probably not quite Taylor's equal as a guitarist, and Taylor also brought a new reliability that contrasted with Jones's increasingly erratic behavior in his last year with the band). On the other hand, in the film the band largely disappears at time. Apart from Mick Jagger, the Stones are not always a palpable presence in their own film.<br /><br />Historicism could be defined with focusing on the meaning of history rather than the objective telling of the events of history, or recounting the events for the sake of getting to their supposed underlying meaning. Sometimes it even involves projecting onto events meaning they would not otherwise have. Altamount is easily one of the most historicized moments in the history of both the sixties and rock and roll. Altamount is rarely treated as an isolated tragedy, but is more frequently regarded as a turning point in history, as if it were when the sixties came crashing to an end (something that I feel can more rightfully be ascribed to Kent State). I don't personally understand this need to project some story of apocalyptic closure to the decade. I'll merely state that I don't think that we should see anything more in Altamount than a tragedy that ought otherwise to have been prevented. It should it not be baptized as, nor was it, a defining moment in history.<br /><br />One frustration I had with the film is that far too often the camera isn't focused on what was happening. There is a tendency for the film to merely drift at times. For instance, while the Flying Burrito Brothers, there are only a couple of incredibly brief shots of Gram Parsons's back. We can hear him singing the song, but we never see him actually singing it. Earlier, when performing the great Robert Johnson song \\"Love in Vain\\" (featuring some of themost powerfully poetic images ever written by an illiterate individual), the camera completely abandons a real-time observation of the performance, and lapses into a near fantasy-like viewing of Mick Jagger swirling about the stage in slow motion.<br /><br />Anyone who loves this film, or merely enjoys it, should definitely read the Stanley Booth book THE TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE ROLLING STONES, which covers the precise same events as the film, but in much greater detail and with more insight both into the events surrounding Altamount and into the members of the band. It is one of the great classics of rock journalism.some of the most powerfully poetic images ever written by an illiterate individual), the camera completely abandons a real-time observation of the performance, and lapses into a near fantasy-like viewing of Mick Jagger swirling about the stage in slow motion.  <br /> <br />Anyone who loves this film, or merely enjoys it, should definitely read the Stanley Booth book THE TRUE ADVENTURES OF THE ROLLING STONES, which covers the precise same events as the film, but in much greater detail and with more insight both into the events surrounding Altamount and into the members of the band.

B00005JMXX|4.0|Hey, either you're the type that loves these FX driven blockbusters usually creaming cities of the US, or you're not. If you enjoy suspending disbelief for a two hour ride, this is yet another Centropolis - Roland Emmerich e-ticket ride. I've seen where folks are tearing-up the movie for certain scenes, but hey, enjoy it or don't, but please, don't pick apart a movie because it took some creative license to carry the story through. Did you expect a written for broadway one-room dialogue packed jewel? Or did you expect the huge special effects and a fun ride? <br /> <br />Personally, the only peeve I have with this DVD is the director's track, which, any film buff enjoys listening to as you learn how people make movies. Well, this was the worst director's track I have ever tried to listen to since the advent of DVD. Rolan, the director, writer, and producer, shared producing credit with Mark Gordon. If Mark Gordon would have kept quiet and allowed Roland to speak on his film, it would have been cool, but me thinks Mark is a not-so closeted HAM, and absolutely didn't shut up the entire movie, at-times actually picking on the actors for performances in a contrived manner. Blah. Hope his producing talent outweighs his obvious obnoxious nature. Like I said, just a peeve, has nothing to do with the film. Watch it and love it if you enjoy these types of films, I sure do! It's as much of centropolis offerings, geande scale fun.
B000001ELR|4.0|By 1982, Kiss' career was literally on its' last legs and breathing its' dying breath as a result of some very costly missteps as well as losing two of its' original members. Beginning with 1979's \\"Dynasty\\" album in which they embraced disco & pop, through 1981's disastrous concept album \\"The Elder\\" in which they managed to alienate much of their hardcore fan base, they also lost both Peter Criss & Ace Frehley in the interim, and now it was all coming back to haunt them.<br /><br />The departures of Criss & Frehley marked the arrivals of drummer Eric Carr and guitarist Vinnie Vincent respectively, and the \\"new\\" Kiss set about to try and pick up the pieces and record a new album. The result was \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" in 1982, a dark and heavy album which saw Kiss returning to their hard rock roots in ferocious fashion.<br /><br />Loaded to the brim with booming, reverberated drums and heavy, machine gun-like guitars, Kiss sounded every bit like a band reborn and on a mission to re-invent themselves. One listen to the sonic-boom drum intro on the lead title track and you knew that the tables had indeed turned and Kiss was ready to kick a** once again!<br /><br />Even the album cover was unique at the time, showing Kiss' faces in makeup standing in darkness and sporting \\"glowing\\" eyes (hence the title \\"Creatures Of The Night\\"); however, despite the fact that Ace Frehley appears on the album cover, he did not play on the album at all.<br /><br />Most of the guitar work was played by Vinnie Vincent, but according to a Gene Simmons interview several years ago, blues/rock guitarist Robben Ford allegedly played on the album, as well. Frehley made only a few promotional appearances for the album and appeared in the video for \\"I Love It Loud\\", which was his last project with Kiss before departing for a solo career.<br /><br />With the release of \\"Creatures Of The Night\\", Kiss' visual image also got a much-needed overhaul, as they were once again sporting studded, leather outfits and longer hair, which contrasted sharply with the short-haired, \\"new romantic\\" look on display during the \\"Elder\\" period the year before. Their new stage setup consisted of a huge, rotating battle tank which acted as Eric Carr's drum riser, and the front cannon fired occasionally.<br /><br />Every track on the album rocks hard and heavy, and highlights include \\"Saint & Sinner\\", the pile-driving \\"Danger\\", \\"I Love It Loud\\", the menacing \\"War Machine\\", and \\"Killer\\". The only weak track here is \\"Rock & Roll Hell\\", which basically sounds like a throwaway, filler track added at the last minute. The lone ballad on the album \\"I Still Love You\\" shows Paul Stanley in emotive mode vocally and a bluesy guitar solo by Vinnie Vincent (or could this be where Robben Ford played? Who knows!)<br /><br />All in all, \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" was the shot in the arm that Kiss needed to get back on the right track, but it was a slow climb as fans were still somewhat skeptical.

B00005JNEU|5.0|No sympathy for Football, but I've got to say Friday Night Lights is an amazing movie. <br />Director Peter Berg, along with his co-screenwriter David Aaron Cohen have done a fantastice job geting the material from the actual events and putting them on screen. The actors put in that great sense of feeling that the pressure is on by the town and their familys. This isn't much of high school foot ball to the teamt, it's a high stakes job that's worlds more important than even their education. As for the town of Odessa, these boys are there movie stars and are hyped as such. The players sign autographs, take pictures with babies, and girls then turn into groupies. All this comes with the fame, but when a game is lost they all feel the brunt of it from the town as well. Even if your not into football indeed you will enjoy this movie. It gets your really hyperactive to play football. Go see this movie!
B000001ELB|2.0|1978 was a very busy and successful year for Kiss, however, all was not well behind the scenes and there was dissention within the ranks. Peter Criss and Ace Frehley were disgruntled with their roles in the band and both announced their intentions to leave Kiss to pursue solo careers. In an unprecedented and somewhat desperate move, the decision was made that Kiss would temporarily \\"disband\\" so that each member could record a solo album under the Kiss banner and all four would be released simultaneously. The idea went over well with Criss & Frehley and it kept them in the band for the time being.<br /><br />During this same time, the band also made the disastrous TV movie \\"Kiss Meets The Phantom Of The Park\\", which coincided with the release of the solo albums; in between, each member somehow found the time to sandwich in promotional appearances wherever they could to promote these projects. In short, Kiss was never out of the public eye that year, but this enormous overexposure would ultimately work against them rather than for them.<br /><br />The third project of that year was the release of \\"Double Platinum\\", which Kiss had very little actually to do with; I'm not quite sure what their record company was thinking by putting out this pointless album, especially with the songs being \\"remixed\\" in such a strange manner. Case in point: whose idea was it to combine the acoustic guitar intro to \\"Rock Bottom\\" with \\"She\\"? Although both songs came from the same album \\"Dressed To Kill\\", they sound totally out of place together.<br /><br />On top of that, Kiss was also asked to re-record the classic \\"Strutter\\" for the album but in a disco style, something the band were very much against at the time. But somehow they were convinced to do it, and the result is the idiotic \\"Strutter '78\\". The integrity of the song is all but ruined with the disco vibe, and you can practically hear that Kiss' hearts were not at all into it, because it sounds lifeless and disjointed.<br /><br />Unless you're a diehard Kiss fan, this is one CD you can really do without owning.Unless you're a diehard Kiss fan, this is one CD you can really do without owning.
B0002858YS|5.0|I recently went to a concert, headlined by The Killers, and it was phenomenal.  They are an amazing band, featuring some of the catchiest and upbeat songs I've heard.  &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot; can get you moving whenever you listen to it - whether you do a little head-bob, or whatever, it get's you up.  The CD is very diverse, going from the fast-paced &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot; to the slower, and more melodic &quot;Everything Will be Alright&quot;.  A definite addition for everyone's collection.
B0001MDPV8|4.0|I have to agree that Nas' Illmatic is indeed one of the greatest, if not the greatest, rap album of all time.  It is not so because of Nas' \\"realness,\\" however, and certainly not for his lack of vocabulary. <br /> <br />Nas' album was revolutionary because of his lyrical cadence, presentation.  Everyone else was rhyming like Fuschnickens, DAS Efx, or ONYX.  Before Illmatic, the entire east coast was screaming, if not rapping, in something that bore only a slight resemblance to English. <br /> <br />Enter Nas.  With a cool voice over seamless production, he laces every track with complex compound rhyme schemes, leaving fans hungry for more and other rappers sounding like cave men, with some notable exceptions Snoop Dog being one.  And even now everyone else sounds like him.  Listen to Jadakiss' new album.  Jadakiss is great, but Nas' influence is undeniable.     <br /> <br />This example from One Love even reads sick  <br /> <br />then i rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes <br />then froze only the blow the herb smoke through my nose <br />and told my little man that i'm a go cyprose <br />there's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose <br />words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above <br />keep an eye out for jake shorty wop <br />one love <br /> <br />I still dont know what \\"cyprose\\" means, but it sounds hot.  Maybe he said something else?  Anyway, spare the details, the images are vivid on all tracks.  And I still pick up new things on every listen. <br /> <br />The only bad thing about Illmatic is that once an artist creates something not only great, but also considerably better than everything before it, he has set an extremely high precedent for himself.  The fans expect not only the same but better.  And although I am an avid Nas fan, I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed with \\"Nastradamus\\" and \\"I Am.\\" <br /> <br />(Listen to Andre of Outkast's verse on \\"Rosa Parks\\" for more on this issue.) <br /> <br />Still Illmatic is great.  It was Written and Stillmatic are two of my personal favorite albums.  If you like Illmatic, see ATLiens from Outkast Only for Cuban Linx from Raekwon, Reasonable Doubt by Jay Z, both jadakiss' albums, also God's Stepson w/ 9th wonder; 9th Wonder and Murs; Blackstar with Mos Def and Talib Kweli <br /> <br />The remixes were pretty bad, 9th wonder should have done them.  Thats why I gave the review four stars.
B000148KK2|5.0|I've been disappointed with her last few \\"albums.\\"  They were too safe, too commercial, and too orchestral.  I want to hear her sound.  This album is what I've waited for and it is incredible.  It is simple, deep feeling, and unique, and when I listen to this I feel I'm in those dark jazz clubs.  The Girl In The Other Room brings back the special sound of Diana Krall.

B0002S94OS|5.0|When grunge hit in 1992, all other forms of hard rock in America either died completely, such as hair metal, or in the case of the more traditional form of good, honest, heavy metal, was forced back underground. After the overrated Seattle sound came some awfully dark times for anyone who grew up during the glory days of metal in the previous decade. By the late 1990s, the only mainstream forms of heavy music out there were either whiny guy post-grunge (a.k.a. college bands), and the repetitive, monotonous nu/rap metal genres. All the while, old-fashioned metal refused to die, always lurking underneath the surface, unknown to mainstream rock audiences, waiting for the right time to pounce. Well, the time is now, and the days of the nu-metal are clearly numbered.  <br /> 2004 has been the most crucial year for metal music in ages, as bands like Killswitch Engage, Fear Factory, and most recently, Shadows Fall, have helped recapture the throne. Leading the way is Lamb of God, who is easily the most important American band in this recent wave of traditional metal artists. They're the ones who have set the bar for the others, and in three albums, have set that bar at a difficult height to overcome. Their first two albums, New American Gospel, and As the Palaces Burn dared to take this form of music to another level. Taking the muscular riffs and powerful percussion of '90's only real metal heavyweight, Pantera, and mashing it all with some unbelievable musical versatility, utilizing the doom-ridden sounds of Slayer, and the sharp technical work of Megadeth. With their latest offering, Ashes of the Wake, being completed in only 5 months time it makes the album all the more impressive.  <br /> As great as As the Palaces Burn was, with instant classics like \\"Ruin\\" and \\"11th Hour\\", its the guitar sound was disappointingly thin. It felt like there was too much air noise in the mix, and the record badly needed a much denser sound. Ashes of the Wake adds some needed fine-tuning to the Lamb of God sound, and the end result is their most real sounding piece of work yet. To hear it for the first time, after listening to the previous two albums, is to be hit right between the eyes with the revelation of just how powerful this band can be on record. On Ashes of the Wake, the guitar work of Willie Adler and Mark Morton is incredibly tight, and technical, establishing them as the finest American metal guitar duo since Slayer's Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Drummer Chris Adler is flawless, his punctuating of the riffs greatly resembles that of Pantera's great Vinnie Paul. His double bass is placed right up front in the mix. Vocalist Randy Blythe emerges as one of the most distinctive frontmen in metal. Instead of always going for the guttural, extreme vocals that have become all too common in the last decade, he takes on a menacing, raspy snarl. He manages to sound ferocious, yet understandable. Not only that, but he can command a crowd like no other, as anyone who has seen him pull off the infamous Braveheart style \\"wall of death\\" in concert will agree.  <br /> The songs on Ashes of the Wake are among the strongest the band has ever written, especially the first track, \\"Laid to Rest\\", with its Dimebag Darrell meets Zakk Wylde riffs, and Blythe's back-and-forth vocal performance, climaxing with the pummeling, Meshuggah-style breakdown. \\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\" was written to be a live song, with its shout-along chorus. The dark \\"Omerta\\" plods along intensely, sounding utterly monolithic, as Blythe adopts almost robotic vocals.  <br /> If the album has a fault, it's that it plows along at pretty much the same pace throughout the duration, something that new listeners might have trouble getting used to. It is something that will require multiple listens, but once they do get used to the intricacies and tricks the entire band has up their sleeves you realize just how solid a record this is. It's actually an instrumental track that provides the best moment, as guitarists Morton and Adler are joined by former Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland and former testament guitarist Alex Skolnick. The quartet engage in a blistering series of solos over a frantic arrangement, held down ably by drummer Chris Adler and bassist John Campbell.  <br /> Ashes of the Wake has become the big breakthrough that traditional metal needed, as it debuted in the Billboard top 50. One can't help but feel that, given more time, Lamb of God will eventually pull off something even better. The album is not earth shattering, but it is absolutely loaded with menacing tremors, with the ominous hint of something even bigger looming on the horizon. It took a full decade for metal to return, but thank God, or Lamb of God, it's back. <br />
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I had given up on Hollywood ever making a magical movie like those of yesteryear. I am 57 so I know what film used to be. I tend to watch independent cinema. However, a friend of mine suggested this movie to me because of its associations with Tibetan Buddhism, which I practice. The wonderful reviews that discuss how the movie is itself playing on the many levels of esoteric art are extremely perceptive. That is what seems like such an accomplishment. Taken as a whole, the movie is a mandela as the reviewers say. As a public interest advocate, I also appreciate the message about the pitfalls of materialism.  <br /> <br />George Bush should be forced to watch this movie and learn something or two about love. Better yet, make a gay or Lesbian version and make him watch that.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've always enjoyed all of the singles from Green Day, but I'd never purchased any of their CDs. After seeing the \\"American Idiot\\" video I knew I had to buy this one and it didn't disappoint. Normally when I buy a CD there are a few songs I don't care for, but this disc is great all the way through. From the first song to the last song, they are all good. While the songs don't all sound like Green Day singles of past, they still have a vibe to them that makes entertaining and meaningful throughout the entire experience. <br /> <br />I highly reccomend this CD.
B00011RPB0|1.0|It's almost unbeliavable how this turkey eraned so much praise. To all the people who have found \\"the hidden meaning of life\\" in this picture, I just ask the following question: Was that Sophia's intention? Or she just realized she had a bomb on her hands and started to advertise this humorless, contrived, mess of a movie as \\"art\\"? I think this is the answer. <br /> <br />LOST IN TRANSLATION is a really bad movie. It's all about holding a camera, telling Murray and Johansson to look bored til death while walking around Tokyo. Useless piece of movie. But, when you have a father like COppola, anything can happen, I guess..
B00004R9A4|5.0|I cannot believe I never saw this when I was growing up.  It is a brilliant movie for the whole family.  I think it surpasses most of the rubbish that is out there today (ie: SHREK) which is written to entertain on the lowest level instead of uplifting and broadening ones mind.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a classic! My children love it and so do I.

B00003CXXJ|1.0|This is not a movie for children. This is for High School kids and College kids and parents of four year olds that want to watch something with out ELMO in it- but really NOT for little children.  I can recognize its appeal to young adults and grown ups but I think it lacks creativity and depth.  Some might say that it is just entertainment and doesn't ahve to mean anything but I think that movies can be entertaining for children and adults and be powerful. Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ice Age, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory... I could go on.  Spare your child this movie.  They will get enough fart jokes in first grade.

B00013PHGS|5.0|I was first introduced to the group Air through their soundtrack for The Virgin Suicides and then I moved onto their classic Moon Safari album. My next step in Air was this glorious album Talkie Walkie. <br />I love this album. It is just as good as Moon Safari and better in some respects. I would say that this is of a much more smooth and melodic type compared to Air's earlier work and albums. <br />There is not a single song on this album I don't like. It's amazing how they effectively use reharmonization in songs like Alone In Kyoto. Also, it's interesting how they purposely tossed in some notes out of key once in a while to make the album never get boring. I love how the album contrasts greatly with Moon Safari but still noticable connections between them for fans of Air to recognize. View this is Moon Safari's melodic more sophisticated counter-part. <br />If I were forced to critize the album it would be that it is a bit repetative, but it doesn't matter because its still interesting and lots of fun to listen to. I have been listening to this album constantly since I bought it last week and I'm not one bit sick of it. <br />The highlights would probably be Cherry Blossom Girl, Universal Traveler, Another Day, and Alone in Kyoto. <br />This album serves as a model for other bands of the genre.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Tom Cruise (\\"The Last Samurai\\", \\"M:I-2\\", etc.) delivers a top notch performance as Vincent, a hit man who hires a cabbie (Jamie Foxx, \\"Ray\\" coming October 29) to drive him to his \\"appointments\\". The movie is a slam dunk for Cruise, in his first real stab at playing a genuine villain (try \\"Richard III\\" next, ok, Tom?) and a virtual knockout punch for Mann (\\"Ali\\", \\"The Last Of The Mohicans\\", etc.) Mark Ruffalo (\\"13 Going On 30\\", etc.) and /Jada Pinkett-Smith (\\"Woo\\", etc.) have small roles in this entertaining thriller. Jason Statham (\\"The Transporter\\", \\"The Italian Job\\") has a cameo at the beginning of the film.  Cruise takes his performance to another level with this one. He's not a TOTAL villain, like Richard III (in the play named for him) or Iago (in Othello), but he either \\"Scares you or thrills you.\\" Thrilled me all the way through. The ending SUCKED, however, but overall, it was an excellent thrill ride. This movie IS NOT for kids. Rated PG-13 for some violence and language.
B0006213WG|5.0|Ever since the release of \\"All Killer, No Filler,\\" Sum 41 has wanted to make it known that they are true to heavy metal. Over the span of their 4 album career (begining with Half Hour of Power) they have demonstrated their ability to create metal-esque riffs. Over time the progression of their sound became more and more heavy. With the release of \\"Chuck\\" I believe they have created what can be called their masterpiece. Forget what genre they maybe dumped into, Sum 41 has finally shown their true colors. With a sonic blend of pop, punk, metal, small portion of emo and a twist of rap (a key element in a few of their hit songs) Sum 41 has managed to develope a sound like no other. This album could be considered Sum's \\"all growed-up album;\\" similar to blink-182's recent self titiled. Chuck is very similar to the first three, but is also notably different. For those who were expecting another All Killer album, better dig deep into this one because it's barley there. These songs are more crafted than the ones that brought fame to Sum 41, yet they are timed just right. My advise; buy this album. It isnt a totally non-conventional album, like everyone seems to think.

B0006213WG|5.0|i really could care less what genre they are. Does it really matter if its just good music? My god too many people have to make sure they are \\"cool\\" by sticking to one genre. Listen to what you want to, not what others want you too. This CD was definately worth the 10.00 i payed for it. Highly recommended, even if you are new to SUM 41's style. The CD has pretty much all i want, i can listen to some emo, or listen to some songs i can headbang too haha. GO GET IT YOU WILL BE HOOKED!!
1400034779|3.0|Light-hearted reading. Very cute, very different cadence to the narrative. Enjoyed it. Not a strong plot, especially if you like page turners. This book meanders like a collection of short stories. America-bashing while glorifying Botswana. I guess readers have a love affair with Africa and I think that's why this book gained great reviews.<BR>There was a lot of male-bashing, but some good guys too, though expressed more subtly. The characters are entertaining, but again the plotlinein this book is dull. The novel is just barely worth reading for the pleasant local color, but as far as mystery fiction goes, I would rather reread Ellis Peters, Anne Perry, Elizabeth Peters, or Cynthia Peale. <BR>The back cover led me to expect &quot;the case that tugs at her heart, and lands her in danger, is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy, who may have been snatched by witch doctors.&quot; What?! Where?! The missing boy case was a teensy part of the book, and certainly did not tug at my heart strings at all. There was barely anything made of it at the end. I would have liked to see at least two of the stories to be tied together, or for some clue from another case to help solve the case of the boy's disappearance. Nothing like that is part of the book.

B000002QWD|5.0|It's a little annoying that so many people only associate Bing Crosby with Christmas music, given his monumental and pioneering achievements in the recording, movie, and radio industries. But let's face it, nobody does Christmas better than Bing. Admit it - the Holidays just don't feel complete unless you've heard Bing croon \\"White Christmas\\" at least once. The fact is, anyone who's ever recorded a secular Holiday song since World War II owes a debt to Mr. Crosby. And this is the album that started it all.<br /><br />\\"Merry Christmas\\" (its original title) was first released in the form of a multiple 10-inch 78-rpm record set in 1945, later making the transition to 33 1/3-rpm LP, and eventually becoming the very first million-selling Christmas album.<br /><br />Bing's 1935 recording of \\"Silent Night\\" (the '47 version is included in this collection) was, in fact, the very first Christmas record to become a huge hit. Ironically, Bing had been reluctant to record a religious song for the purpose of commercial gain, and he only agreed to do it if the proceeds went to charity.<br /><br />Irving Berlin's \\"White Christmas\\", on the other hand, was not only the first secular Holiday tune to do well, it ultimately became the biggest selling record of all time (current estimates have it at over 50 million), and it opened the floodgates to an onslaught of annual postwar Holiday recordings by major artists that continues to this day. Its initial success was attributed to its striking a chord with homesick GI's in the Pacific Theatre of Operations during the Second World War, but that somehow spilled over onto the Home Front, and it continued long after the troops returned. So much so that it cracked the Top 40 in an amazing sixteen different years!<br /><br />For my money, \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" is the real gem of this set. Could the troops have been any less pensive and wistful upon hearing this breathtaking recording in the winter of 1943 than they had been with \\"White Christmas\\" the year before? Bing's voice floats hauntingly over the opening guitar strains as we're drawn for a brief moment into a parallel, yet more reflective and somewhat melancholy realm . . . until we're finally lulled gently back to our own time and place with the exquisitely sustained final note. This is artistry of the highest order, and the perfect marriage of singer and song. Anyone who only remembers the aging Bing Crosby of the leisurely TV Christmas Specials of the 1960's and `70's should give this performance a serious listen.<br /><br />Holiday novelty tunes are certainly still a part of our world, and \\"Christmas In Killarney\\" and \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" have to be categorized as such, but they're so darned warm and infectious one can't imagine this collection without them. Besides, once upon a time Bing was as well known for singing Irish and Hawaiian songs as he was for Christmas ones.<br /><br />Another one of my favorites is \\"It's Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas\\", which unfailingly elicits an almost Pavlovian reaction of childlike anticipation of the Yuletide season every time I hear it.<br /><br />There's a lot more to enjoy here, particularly Bing's workout with the inimitable Andrews Sisters on the jazzed-up \\"Jingle Bells\\" (recently ripped off, note for note, harmony for harmony, and pause for pause, by Barry Manilow), but I'll leave the rest for you to discover. Or rediscover, since these songs and carols are all practically a part of our collective unconscious. If they're not, if you're too young to have heard this collection before - well, trust me, it's essential Holiday listening.<br /><br />And it is, as they say, the perfect stocking stuffer!\\"White Christmas\\" the year before?

B00003CXCT|5.0|First, these films are amongst the best picture quality I have ever seen in a DVD.  Not to say that they are THE best, but they are up there. <br /> <br />The detail is on point.  You can now see the weaves of the clothes and see the wetness of their hair.  It is super sharp.  As a matter of fact, it is sharper than The Phantom Menace which was flimed (or just edited?) in digital.  No need to go into the stories... <br /> <br />Many people complain that these are not the originals.  True, but what else is there?  Do you really want the untouched originals on DVD in this day and age?  I am a huge Star Wars fan, but if the origianls were not cleaned up, then Lucas can leave them off of DVD.  However.... <br /> <br />...Let me talk about the worst parts of this set.  Things that he should not have touched!  Let's start with SW.  When Ben and Luke go to Mos Eisley, as Ben gives the stormtrooper the Jedi mind tirck, right beofore that scene, there ae new digital effects to get in the way of the original scene!  A distraction.  Before that, Lucas added a large creature where a Jawa falls off and robots fight.  All out foolishness!  It takes away from the serious tone that this film had for so many years.  Then there is the Jabba the Hut scene.  I still think that they should have done this better, but I do not think that it should have been omitted like others do.  They should have added the delted scenes with Luke and Biggs instead of trying to get money when he does release the ORIGINAL, UNALTERED verisons on HD-DVD. <br /> <br />The Empire Strikes Back.  It seems to be everyone's favorite, and mine too.  This one was touched the least.  As it should given the fact that it was almost perfect to begin with.  The additons form the other Special Eiditons like the Wampa scene and other extended scenes were actually a good thing.  It did get you to see more of what you liked about the film.  The only major thing here is the scene with Darth Vader and the Emperor.  It was reshot and rescripted.  On the one hand, I like for things to remain in the origianl vision the director had.  On the other hand the new scene is cleaners and does not distract, but it is an after the fact scene which I must dismiss as false.  This is still the best of all of them. <br /> <br />Return of the Jedi has the worst changes!  From the BS musical number in Jabba's palace(the worst addition!!!!), to the stupid additon of the Gungans in the end, and the DUMBEST addition of adding Hayden as Anakin over the old Anakin!  This is idiotic!  If future generations were to see this film and it's 1983 date and see the prequels and their dates, they will ask themselves how was this guy the say age 20 years ago?  He was hardly born.  This is all out stupid!  It again, ruins the original vision of the time.  All in all, I do like the ending a little better as it now does now leave you hanging.  I can now say that I don't need to see anymore Star Wars.  Especially if it will be kidde style from here on out. <br /> <br />Should you get it - yes, if you like Star Wars.  It is like you must get it as a fan.  Too much changing can make a man never satisfied and Lucas will always look for something to be wrong and he'll end up making it worse...

B0002I831S|5.0|Finally Paramount has released the original Star Trek series in one-volume single season sets.  It was way to expensive for me to buy in the previous two-episode sets.  This 8-disk set of the first season is just what I've been waiting for.  It contains every episode from the first season plus bonus features. <br /> <br />When first purchasing this I was a little fearful that the production quality would be poor.  Despite a few flaws - I felt the production quality was very good, unlike many single-season sets I've bought of other television shows.   <br /> <br />The special features were a bit of a disappointment.  None of them are particularly good except the interview with Leonard Nimoy, which I did find very interesting and offered some insight into the shows, its characters, and the actors. <br /> <br />So if you are a fan of the original Star Trek I highly recommend this set. <br />

B0002KVUKM|2.0|I was pumped up for this film when I first saw the trailer. First off, how can you go wrong with Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman. Plus, Hugh Jackmen is awesome. <br /> <br />I think the major reason the film failed on so many levels is Stephen Sommers. I can't stand any of his other films and after the first ten minutes, which up til then it was filmed quite nice and had a great feel to it, it's a total waste of film. Sorry, this is one of the worst films of the year. Save your money and cash. If you have to see it, rent it....for cheap, cheap, cheap.
B00000IQV7|5.0|Well Patch Adams wasn't what i expected it was well funny. Too be honest Patch is well a bit wierd and he like hangs around dying people and jokes around. I mean if he was around and one of my relatives was dying i'd tell him where to go. People think it's sad and i suppose it is ut the 5 stars are for comedy value Robin Williams chat up lines and jokes are so bad there funny
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore has built his reputation on exposing corporate misdeeds and government corruption.  This movie is an obvious attack on Bush, but one that fails to provide much investigation into what really happened to facilitate the events of 9-11 and America's descent into fascism.  Also, Moore represents a voice for the communist-socialist critique of fascism (fascism being nationalist-socialist) - a tyranny that professes to be benevolent challenging one that appears elitist and arrogant.  Moore starts off with the 2000 election, displaying sympathy for the Al Gore cause (which is not a way to start a documentary if you wish to appear objective).  As he moves into 9-11 and its aftermath, he has a lot of entertaining and heart-wrenching material to lay on the viewer.  Moore is clever at putting together music, video, and voice overs to create a compelling story in this way.  However, he fails to present a lot of evidence about government complicity and elite agendas which can be found in independently distributed documentaries that have been produced about 9-11.  Moore's film only scratches the surface of a dark, disturbing story, and allows the viewers to think they have now been informed about Bush & 911 and that the situation can be improved by going out to vote for Bush's Democratic election opponent, a member of the same secret society and elite network that pull Bush's strings.  This film is vintage Michael Moore, and hopefully it will stir some people to start doing independent research into history and current events, a type of research that goes beyond entertainment and clever juxtapositions of sound and video footage.
B0002Y4TTC|3.0|3 and a half stars, actually.<br /><br />Let me explain what I didn't like first: specifically, Hansi Kursch's performance. I don't know if he had some trouble with his voice, or if he just simply can't sing what he sings in the studio; lower notes he can reach, but the high pitched stuff he can not. After watching the second DVD I'm thinking that he had some trouble with his voice during the concert on the first DVD, since the four bonus songs sound perfect. With the exception of Hansi's voice, the rest of the band is perfect. Marcus Siepen guitar work is simply amazing, and Thomas Stauch is nothing short of an athlet and a very, very good drummer, and last but not least there's Andr&eacute; Olbrich, wich makes almost all the background guitars. The guest musicians, the keyboardist and bass player don't get much attention from the camera.<br /><br />Some people mentioned BG's members as being very still...personally, I don't care about this, as I don't require the members of a band to be a Freddie Mercury or a Paul Stanley, but...it's true: man, they are *stiffs* onstage!<br /><br />Some minor glitches: at some points the camera shifts views a lot, with pointless views, by the way, and the guest musicians don't get much camera attention.<br /><br />Now, the things I like:<br /><br />As I wrote above, band performance. The set list: covering most of BG's albums, there's a song for almost every fan; hell, even \\"And then, there was silence\\" is played complete (well, Hansi forgets to sing a line from the song heheh, but that's *one error* in a 14 minute song!). The extras are very good, specially the four bonus songs (I was going to be very angry if I didn't get to see \\"Into the storm\\", heheh). Did I mention the crowd? hearing all of 'em singing the chorus of the songs it's wonderful! I'm not going to delve into sound and video quality: they're both acceptable, nothing exceptional here.<br /><br />Last but not least, packaging is very good looking.<br /><br />Overall, a pretty good DVD from BG./>Overall, a pretty good DVD from BG.

B00005JNEI|3.0|The opening scenes about the 2000 election with all the Af-American representatives being dissed by the Senate...LED BY AL GORE is so ironic that you can't help but feel dumbfounded. Why would AL so vigorously deny the reps a Senate signature.  Either Gore was defeated or is complicit due to the mutual interest of the \\"2\\" parties.     Politics seems to be a grand illusion required to conduct business (see Carlysle group). The 2 party system is a sham...aristocratic Dems and Rebs have different social opinions but the same business model. To profit through warfare-sickness-poverty as a last resort is as old as manknd itself I'm sure.    As far as the film it's really a black comedy. It can make you laugh and cringe.  Kind of like Natural Born Killers or JFK (director?)...ultra-violent, realistic and bold. Mixing reality and fiction, or 1/2-truth's. Disengenousness in general.    Moore's films are supposed to be taken with a grain (at least) of salt. But if you look at the film simply as a list of odd ironies...it's hilarious. Moore makes it easy to blame people but in the end these are     Saying this I feel for the soldiers/veterans/families that are being traumatized again by war. We should get out after elections and monitor from a distance.    Remember, we are all human and full of shortcomings. Maybe Moore takes his delusions of grandure too seriously. But so does Bush.
B00005JKOI|5.0|This movie is one of the best for 1980's fans: <br /> <br />1.  The soundtrack is outstanding, featuring several huge hits from that great decade! <br /> <br />2.  Molly Ringwald is superb.  She does a great job portraying the intelligent girl who has one problem, she is from the wrong side of the tracks!  Jon Cryer is great as the wacky best friend \\"Ducky\\" who has a secret love interest in Molly.  Great performances by Andrew McCarthy (as her love interest) and James Spader who plays McCarthys evil best friend (a role he would often play in the 1980's).   <br /> <br />3.  It is a somewhat of a 1980's version of Cinderella.  I enjoyed how it showed there is good in everyone(except maybe Spader).  Except for a few words and a couple of suggestive scenes, this is a great movie for all ages...a timeless piece of history form my youth (class of 1984!).
B00005JNEI|5.0|First and foremost I applaud Michael Moore. Essentially what is in this film is what is in his book, \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\" Although I have to tell you I didn't read all of it because it was quite a bore, all facts! A List of them, on and on he goes. Thus he created a more \\"user friendly\\" version which Farenheit 9/11. <br />This movie is an eye-opener. To the average american who maybe doesn't get NPR or has access to the internet or no CSPAN or cable for that matter, they only get your basic 3 major networks. Their news and in fact MOST American Media is biased. My friends sister asked, when we were watching the film, \\"where did moore get all this information?\\" Well I said, some of it he did himself I'm sure but there are other media in the world such as Britain's BBC, Middle Eastern News and others like Australia or Asian news. I'm sure it's out there if one investigates. <br />So I bought the DVD. First time ever buying a DVD. I have cable, and if I need to see a movie it's Blockbuster time. But this was more important. I went to work and told everyone I knew if they've seen it and alot said no. So I started a 2 day free rental. Low and behold I have a list until election day. I advised everyone to watch it with freinds and family members especially people who are undecided. And yet there are two people at work that are stout Republicans. I offered because of course they don't want to PAY for moore's \\"crap\\", to let them see it for free. They adamantly declined.   <br />The problem with the entire system is RetrovsMetro.org. Read up. People are so blinded by everything that they are not the least bit interested to open their mind to other opinions. I could say more but that would be an entire book. Please watch it and decide for yourself. I would see farenhype 9/11 although the trailer just gives people saying \\"it's all a lie\\" so we will see. Be objective!
B00005JL9B|5.0|Before I saw this movie, I was quite troubled with this movie. First I had read the back of the DVD saying that young teenagers killing each other... This kind of plot was the kind of plot that would make an awful movie of senseless violence and just plain psychotic and not a movie worth seeing. The reason I saw this movie was because of it's controversy. People in japan tried to oppose the movie from being released and since it has been released, I want to see how Contro. it is. and I also Like foreign Films. <br /> <br />Battle royale's plot is that japan has gone into a corrupt society, along with the corruption, the country's youth has gone rebellious: 800,000 students boycott school. The government cannot control hundreds of thousands of rebellious teenagers and therefore have to force classes into participating in battle Royale. Once the class is there, they get a kit with food and water, compass, flash light and a random weapon. three days limit of killing and surviving. There is only one winner. If there are more than one, the necklaces the students wear will explode and all dies. <br /> <br />To tell the truth, After seeing this movie, it made me really love this film. The movie was just made really well. Irespect that people would want to avoid this film because of it's plot. Yes, there is killing but I rather say this film is about survival, courage, fierce loyalty, friendship and decisions. <br /> <br />ACTING: No doubt in a film, acting is the most important inorder for the film to really capture the realism of it. The young actors we see aren't the ones we see in hopeless and funny ( not litterally) movies which makes us laugh because of the stupid acting. Here in battle Royale, we see true talent emerge. In a story of survival, acting is very important, WE see people in BR crying, screaming, arguing in situations that would be the most horrendous. WE also see hapiness when there is a happy moment and we can feel the character's emnotion and really getinto the movie. <br /> <br />SCREENPLAY: The screen play I cannot really judge because I cannot 100 % fully understand japanese, but the subtitles are quite good. I can understand everything. Forget the stupid pirated ones when the subtitles don't match the image. The subtitles are well made and are suitable for foreign viewers like myself. <br /> <br />Direction: Kinji Fukasaku is was 70 years old when he made battle royale, I respect this fine director for making an incredible movie and for his enthusiasm to make it into a successful one. Because of his energy into making battle royale, His direction of Battle royale is really nice. We see nice scenery and by seeing documentaries, we see Kinji Fukasaku being a true perfectionist. (in the scene were kitano slaps Nobbuo, he had to do it many times to make the scene perfect , sdlap after slap after slap...\\"ouch\\") <br />Thats why this film is really perfect because of his good direction. I haven't read the book but a 400+ page book into a near 2 hour movie, he's done a good job... <br /> <br />The issue of violence: Before the movie, the violence is the main thing that stands out, when you finished the film, the violence don't get in the way. AS I said before, the movie is about the act of survaival not based on violence...  the violence isn't for entertainment but to capture the fear and emotion of the situation. Where we see a child die by machine guns, we feel sorry for the student and feel sorry for all of them who have to go through this situation. I felt sad about this movie and I thought this a movie more about tragedy than senseless killing. <br /> <br />Excitement: The excitement in Battle Royale is really good. It keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time, will all of the murdering, emotion and fantastic acting make Battle royale very entertaining.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: IN a movie, conclusion is very important, Battle royale's conclusion is very nice and not stupid, the movie ends in a very satisfying way ( but can confuse some viewers) but the problem is that when the credits roll, lifting pop music starts to roll.....] <br /> <br />Music: The use of Classical music is very powerful. I loved the theme in the beggining. and the music by bach: air string on G. <br />It actually suits really, really well with the movie.  <br />The original score is also done really well. I don't know the composer but I noticed the richness of the orchestration and the correct emotion to suit the image in screen. well done <br /> <br />OVERALL:::: <br />BATTLE ROYALE is one of the BEST Japanese movie I have ever seen, the movie has a very original plot and it stands out over other movies. To undertsnat this movie, you must look deep in the movie and you'll see what kind of movie Fukasaku (director) has made with Battle Royale <br /> <br />
B000060P79|3.0|I admit it lacks some originalty,so I am pinning that the sophomore cd is better. But the riffs are catchy and just teenage things that make people smile and hum along. My favorite tracks are: My Alien, God Must Hate Me, Addicted, and Meet You There. Oh! And to poke fun at Christmas, you should listen to the hidden track on 13. So cool..........this band could be better though.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Leave it to George Lucas to create the best movie series of all time, screw it up, then tell us the only version we can buy on DVD is the messed up one!  Some of the changes in the \\"Special\\" edition are just annoying - like putting a young Anakin at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi\\", but some of them totally change the film we grew up with - I'm sorry, but at the beginning of \\"A New Hope\\", Han was exactly the type of person who would shoot Greedo first.  Why on earth would Lucas mess with that?  I am a die-hard Star Wars fan, but I would rather die than pay Lucas money for this twisted version of a classic movie series!
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Deliciously skirts the edge of rococo excess without quite tipping over the brink - rich, orchestral layers atop insistent, satisfying base signatures, offset by delicate piano and synth riffs. And soaring over this incredibly varied landscape - Tarja Turnunen's exhilarating, flawless vocals continue to thrill...  <br /> <br />\\"Nemo\\" and \\"Ghost Love Score\\" are particularly stunning, but be warned, this entire album deserves more than a casual listen. Dim the lights, don the headphones, sink into the music, and depart the real world for awhile... <br /> <br />\\"Once\\" IS The Standard by which all other symphonic/orchestral/progressive metal albums will be judged for years to come. Although I wonder whether Nightwish will ever surpass this release, I look forward eagerly to their trying... <br />
0385335482|2.0|I read \\"can you keep a secret\\" first & I liked it, which is why I checked out all her other books.  I managed to finish \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" & moved on to \\"Shopaholic takes Manhattan\\" & I couldn't make myself go beyond 20 pages!  It's the same old same old... Becky is such a stupid girl who has no idea of her finances & has no self-discipline. She's plain dumb.  She also bears resemblence the main character in \\"can you keep a secret\\".   <br /> <br />I much prefer \\"Devil wears Prada\\" & \\"Second Assistant\\". <br />
0446310786|4.0|This book is one of the best I have ever read. The book takes place many moons ago in the southern states. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat with scene such as Shootings, Rape, and Segregation. The characters are young and full of ambhition, and very misgevious.Once you pick up this book you wont be able to put it down.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite recent cd's. i was not a huge fan of rage against the machine OR soundgarden before audioslave  came out, and now i listen to both. songs like \\"like a stone\\" and cochise are brilliant and Chris Cornell's voice is amazing along with the music which is awesome too.i dont understand how anyone could hate this cd unless they were die hard fans of rage against the machine or soundgarden before hand and were never really willing to give audioslave a chance.i give this cd 5 stars by far. keep crankin em out audioslave!
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Though not a masterpiece, Gothika does a pretty good job of conveying the eerie feeling one looks for in a thriller.  Halle Berry does a great job in her dramatic role as Dr Miranda Grey, though Robert Downey Jr's and Penelope Cruz's characters are a bit overshadowed by Berry's character (especially Cruz).  A combination of Silence of the Lambs, 8MM, and the Sixth Sense with a touch of X-Files, Gothika is certain to provide a good deal of entertainment.  The plot, the setting, and the special effects are all very good!  Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, even though you might not want to go the extra mile and purchase it.
B00001QEBQ|2.0|Mulan is the epitome of everything wrong with Disney right now.    For starters, understand that Mulan is not so much a movie, as it is a \\"product.\\"  First and foremost, the impetus behind Mulan is to generate maximum commerical consumption through endorsements of sugar-coated breakfast cereals, fast food, fruit snacks, and the launching of a whole line of toys, clothing, and other merchandise; the details and quality of the actual \\"movie\\" are ancillary and secondary concerns.    While utilizing some remarkable animation, the film itself is as flimsy as the toys you get with the McDonald's Happy Meal.  Another example of shameful corporate pandering to politically correct and feminist ideology, Mulan fits perfect into the string of PC Nineties films released by Disney (Pocohontas, Hunchback, etc.,), in which everything \\"western,\\" \\"Christian,\\" \\"male\\" or \\"traditional\\" etc., is portrayed as bad, while its opposite, is of course, good.  For example, Mulan single-handedly (1) destroys the entire Hun army (2) saves the Emporer of China's life, and (3) armed with nothing but a hand fan, wastes the Hun leader - because \\"Girls Kick Butt.\\"  Men, on the other hand, are portrayed throughout the film as fumbling, bumbling, nose-picking idiots who provide comic relief.    The songs and lyrics - take \\"A Girl Worth Fighting For\\" (a song intended to show us how \\"dumb\\" and \\"chauvenistic\\" men are) or \\"Honor to Us All\\" - are weak, canned, second-rate material fit for a Christopher Guest \\"spoof-umentary\\" of Walt Disney musicals in the vein of \\"Second Wind,\\" or \\"Spinal Tap.\\"      And for good measure, Disney had to make sure to throw in plenty of inappropriate sexual/body function/bathroom humor for a \\"family\\" film that still somehow garnered a \\"G\\" rating.  Lots of yucks are provided for example, in a story-line that could easily work in a soft-core flick as Mulan frolics in a lake with a bunch of nude men, herself naked.  While no nudity is actually shown, it is MORE than implied as themen prod her to join in a game of \\"King of the Rock.\\"  Faithful sidekick Mushu saves the day, however, by biting one of the men's \\"butts\\" to create a diversion.  As Mulan makes her getaway, she proclaims that she never wants to see another naked man as long as she lives - but not before the entire chinese army parades past her in the buff on their way to the lake.  Nice.    Of course, the antics in Mulan pale in comparison to the gross-out gags/inappropriate content in other \\"family\\" movies like Shrek, and later Disney films, Lilo & Stitch and Home on the Range.  However, its sad that Disney felt it had to compromise its art and include any of this kind of material in order to appeal to the lowest common denominator.    And finally, the story.  Sheer Disney.  While trying to appear politically correct by using a non-Western story and characters, the film quite remarkably had the opposite effect.  It turned off Asian-American audiences in droves by its stereotypical and offensive portrayals of its Asian characters - complete with slanty eyes and buck teeth -, mindless and racist assumptions about Chinese culture, and an apparent inability to distinguish amongst Asian cultures throughout the movie (complete with Chinese chracters wearing Japanese style kimonos as they perform a Japanese tea ceremony and Huns - a Central Asian Turkic People - drawn like Mongol Hordes.  Oh well, I guess if you're Disney, \\"all those asians look alike\\" anyway...).      The story of Mulan itself - a character from Chinese literature and folklore - was \\"Disneyfied\\" per usual to fit the Hollywood formula and social agenda of Disney, much to the dismay of those familiar with the REAL Mulan. In the end, Disney's shallow and crass attempt to \\"embrace diversity\\" was revealed for what it was.    As long as Disney remains a soulless corporation, controlled by money-grubbing CEO's like Michael Eisner, who's only concern is maximizing profits, this is the best you can hope for.  Its no surprise that the only worthwhile thing to come out of Disney during its self-proclaimed rebirth, has been Fantasia 2000 - the pet project of Walt Disney's own son, Roy Disney, who incidentally was pivotal in trying to wrest the control of Disney from Eisner.    Like I said, the animation is good stuff.  Watch it and be moderately entertained for an hour; laugh at Eddie Murphy's one-liners.  Just don't give this \\"product\\" any more credit than it deserves.
0780619951|1.0|Absolute TRASH from the word go - I can't even believe that I had to give it one star - 0 is more appropriate. How can so many people give this junk 5 stars??? I appreciate the fact of artistic license, in respect of reworking the Well's book, but this is a damn right liberty - loose plots & characters made this one of the most abysmal yawn inducing films ever made - not to mention the extremely diinterested looking David Thewlis - who obviously wishes he were elsewhere, you know what so do we!! <br />    I hate films that take a narrative from the original story and twists it so far that it becomes nothing like, or remotely like (In this case) the original. It also has the audacity to tack onto the end a 'cheesemungous' lecture about how we should all take care of our environment and the ecology of the planet.....yeah, right! <br />     It would be a good idea for all those that think this movie is some kind of class act to revisit the Well's book and read what the original concept was for the story - instead of accepting this abortion as some work of genius. <br />     If you don't want to read the original then for goodness sake go and watch the 1977 Burt Lancaster film - an entertaining film even if it drifts from the original story, but one heck of a better film than this clanger!
B00005JMJG|5.0|THe only creative movies made lately are independent films that hardly anyone sees because the theatres never show them. But amazingly a film has been made that can only be considered genius viewing after viewing. What's fantastic about this movies is it keeps you thinking a long time after you see it. Charlie Kauffman (spelled wrong) seems to do that alot, and that's a good thing. To praise this movie more i must say that after this Jim Carrey has become a superb actor, as he also showed in THe Truman Show, another great movie. From the moment the movie starts it captures you, and you are way too intrigued to leave for a second. Jim's quiet way of acting in this movie connects with your heart immediately. If you like movies that you don't have to think about then don't see this movie. But if you're looking for a more creative, thought provoking film, go check it out.
B00005JMUA|4.0|I was so worried that the second offering would be a repetition of the first volume.  If that happened, the whole cinematic experience would become lame.  If you could remember the first volume, it was depicted in many styles and I was happy to inform you all that the second volume was a continuation of that.  Quentin said it well that whilst first volume was paying homage to the Eastern elements and second volume was paying homage to the Western elements.  The soundtrack was done by Robert Rodriquez (of Marichi's fame) and it fitted this movie very well.  For (violent) movie enthusiasts, I couldn't say this enough, this movie was made by someone who was passionate about his craft!  For those that missed Quentin's dialogues as we witnessed in Pulp Fiction, we gotta see heaps in this offering.  As David Carradine explained in the behind-the-scene, Quentin's movies were never about violence but providing us with an insight of how bad people ticked.  Thus, his willingness to partake in this project.  Gordon Liu was back second time around to play Pai-Mei (a bad arse kung-fu master who taught the Bride her martial arts skill).  This movie contained a lot of surprises like cameo appearances by the least expected persons, additional footage if you are willing to wait to the VERY end of credits, and we got to find out the real name of the Bride's name!  Highly enjoyable and truly watchable.  You would be crazy to miss this one.  Strictly for the Quentin's fans only
6304806426|4.0|Remember the Seinfeld episode wherein Elaine Benes proclaimed how lousy and slow this movie was? (\\"Why don't you just diiieee!\\") Well, that was enough to prevent me from seeing \\"The English Patient,\\" until recently, that is. I finally decided to kick back and watch the film to see for myself if it was as bad as Elaine said it was (or as good as so many others contended).<br /><br />First of all, the film isn't nearly as long as rumored; it's only two hours and twenty minutes (not including the end credits). Compare that to, say, \\"Titanic\\" which is almost an hour longer or \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" which is an hour and a half longer.<br /><br />Secondly, as long as one is psychologically prepared to see a drama/adventure flick and not an action film, the story sustains interest quite well. Some sequences are slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Needless to say, if you're a big fan of \\"Armageddon\\" -- essentially a two and a half hour trailer with its never-ending quick (and irritating) edits -- you will not like this flick.<br /><br />One might criticize the ignoble and unfaithful character of the lead players. While this is understandable, I don't feel the movie justifies or glorifies their actions -- it's simply a story about REAL people with REAL flaws who make REAL mistakes (just like you and me) and must suffer the consequences. And suffer they do. Besides, there are some highly likable and noble characters in the cast, like Kip and Hana.<br /><br />In light of the criticism of how long and boring this flick is, I was delighted to discover quite a few scenes filled with suspense, action and high-adventure. For example, the plane crash scene (the second one), the desert storm sequence, the bomb-about-to-explode episode and the fight-to-the-death in the train scene, just to name a few.<br /><br />As many reviewers note, the desert cinematography is marvelous; in fact, the movie is worth seeing for this alone.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"The English Patient\\" has elements of \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" and \\"A Passage to India;\\" if you're a fan of the style, pace and realism of these movies then \\"The English Patient\\" is for you.ements of \\"Lawrence of Arabia,\\" \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" and \\"A Passage to India;\\" if you're a fan of the style, pace and realism of these movies then \\"The English Patient\\" is for you.
0684800713|5.0|Sun Also Rises <br /> <br />The sort of book where the characters move from one place to another, in an endless party - which perfectly characterises the left bank of Paris in the 20's, where the novel opens, and the endless party of the Fiesta in Spain, where the characters make their way to. <br /> <br />Its undercurrent of lost and unrealised love has immense appeal. The relationship between the inimitable Lady Ashley (a character with as much appeal as Holly Golightly - Hemingway hated Capote, so would turn in his grave at this comparison) and the narrator, Jake Barnes is surely one of the most interesting in all literature. <br /> <br />The pure beauty of this novel can be put very simply: instead of almost every other book, where the reader is told what they should feel about every little moment, the reader is how put in the position of a film viewer: they are permitted to look at scenes and think: \\"ooh, what's he thinking now\\" or \\"she won't like that\\" or \\"does he love her?\\" <br /> <br />Put simply, The Sun Also Rises is so much fun to read because there is so much more for the reader to do, because Hemingway invented the art of not saying those things - and was good enough that, in this book, they all come across vibrantly.
B000002NJS|5.0|What Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band did for The Beatles, Ray of Light does for Madonna; new influences (in particular her daughter and the 'electric' William Orbit), a new direction (namely motherhood) and a different style (visually and musically)...yet it's essentially still the Madonna we've loved since the mid 1980's - she's still sexy, still pushing the boundaries and she's still got something to say. <br />  <br />Despite the electronica/techno music (which completely rocks, incidentally), Ray of Light seems to be Madonna's most personal and spiritual album - it's like she's sharing her intimate thoughts and feelings with us for the first time in 15 years. <br />  <br />This seemingly new-found 'freedom' seems to be reflected in both her her voice and new style. Thanks to her work for and on Evita during her 'music hiatus', Madonna's voice sounds more incredible than ever - it's sweeter, deeper, more powerful and seemingly more effortless. <br /> <br />Madonna has never looked so fresh and beautiful, either - the evidence is in the CD booklet and her Ray Of Light video clips (especially the title track and the \\"Power of Goodbye\\") - go see for yourself and then try and beg to differ! :) <br /> <br />The tracks themselves are a perfect combination of everything from sweet and intimate (e.g. \\"Little Star\\") right through to cranking dance-floor power-tracks (e.g. \\"Nothing Really Matters\\")- and everything in between! <br /> <br />With the exception of Shanti/Ashtangi (personal opinion, mind you), I can't fault any of the tracks on the album, but if I had to pick a couple of faves, they would have to be \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\" and \\"Swim\\" for their gorgeous mellow-ness (if that's a word!) and \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Skin\\" - two completely awesome, thumping tracks that never fail to get me up and 'dance' (I use that term very loosely LOL.) <br /> <br />To date, Ray of Light is my favourite Madonna album (with Music running a very tight second) - all thesongs blow me away with their power, passion and somewhat intimate 'look-in' of the world's most influential and successful female music artist. Nobody does it like Madonna! <br /> <br />How any self-declared Madonna fan could not own this album is completely beyond me! What are you waiting for??!!
0446677450|3.0|When he isn't engaged in his nearly incessant showboating, Kiyosaki actually gets down to some practical, all be it general, guidance on how to think about money:<br /><br />* Probably the greatest insight is how to think about assets and liabilities.  A million accountants scream in anguish, but a primary residence, with a large mortgage, high taxes and high fixed costs to top it off, is not an \\"asset\\" for Kiyosaki because it doesn't produce a positive cash flow.  Instead, he lists several items, such as rental property, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, business partnerships with limited involvement, promissory notes and royalties (p. 89), that generate money and should be invested in.<br /><br />* Don't get into large debt positions for non-necessities.  Buy your luxury items for cash (p. 176).  This is part of any sound financial planning and is taken to its logical endpoint by the authors of \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\"<br /><br />* Watch out for the tax effect of your sales of real estate.  In this sense, the book is out of date, since the tax laws were changed in the late 90s to permit up to $250,000 in capital gains ($500,000 for married couples) from the sale of a primary residence be exempt from federal tax, under certain circumstances.  No longer must you rely on the 1031 \\"trading up\\" provision he describes, at least not exclusively.<br /><br />* Fear can be utilized as a great motivator to act, as opposed to fear causing you to be a deer in the headlights of life.<br /><br />However, before we all run off to leverage real estate to become gentlepeople of leisure, let's try to remember a few things.<br /><br />* This book is written for one reason: to be earn the author money.  Kiyosaki is even somewhat up-front about it, noting that royalties are one of the best assets for a person to have (p. 89).  Therefore, you should be skeptical -- not cynical but merely skeptical -- about the advice he gives.<br /><br />* For every Kiyosaki there's a multiple of people who crashed and burned in stock and real estate speculation, and the difference between the author and those people is due in some measure to chance.<br /><br />* It is much easier to invest in undervalued, illiquid assets in downturns when you're already sitting on a pile of cash.<br /><br />* Dropping our current jobs to do Kiyosaki's kind of analysis and investing does not make sense for most of us.  After all, our jobs are, in Kiyosaki's sense, an \\"asset\\" because they generate positive cash flow.<br /><br />* The principle of \\"paying yourself first\\" (p. 172) is not something to be applied inflexibly.  Kiyosaki is giving everyone advice from a position that may not be applicable to everyone (p. 176).  Yes, the idea of saving a portion of your income is a good idea, even an outstanding idea.  But stiffing the tax man and your creditors is not, and unless you operate a business or are engaged in a profession where you can rapidly earn extra cash, it's not a good idea to try to scare yourself into coming up with a brilliant plan to pay them off.  You might wind up with a solution like George Segal and Jane Fonda in \\"Fun With Dick and Jane.\\"<br /><br />* Beware the author's personal biases.  If he truly believed that America is \\"on the course\\" to collapsing because the difference between the haves and have-nots is widening (p. 48), he'd be investing in foreign real estate, in gold and would hold a lot of money in cash.  He's not.  In fact, he does the exact opposite.  He bets on American's long-term stability by purchasing real estate.<br /><br />* The author casually talks about extremely risky investments, such as $5,000 investments returning $1,000,000, as if these were almost ordinary (p. 78).  That's highly misleading.  He does mention in the book that out of ten limited investments, a preponderance of his business investments \\"go nowhere\\" or completely fail, but that should be highlighted when those stratospheric returns are mentioned.<br /><br />Overall, Kiyosaki has some good advice.  However, do not think that you are likely to duplicate his personal experience to success.  If you look at how he made his money, he essentially got rich holding real estate in the 70s, in Hawaii, as well as being one of the state's best salesmen.  He was at the right place at the right time, with a particular important skill.  He then had sufficient money in the 80s and 90s to be able to invest in real estate in the economic downturns.  So his position does not correspond to most of ours.are mentioned. <br /> <br />Overall, Kiyosaki has some good advice.

B00005JNJ7|5.0|First of all, this is completely inappropriate for children, teenagers, grandparents, or anyone who is offendable.   <br /> <br />Many people who have tried to watch South Park can't get past the language, vulgarity, and political incorrectness.  But those who can recognize that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are masters of the art of satire -- politics, culture, and cinema.  This film will be regarded by South Park fans as their best work to date, and by SP critics as their worst. <br /> <br />I thought the story worked best as a puppet show rather than live-action or computer-animation.  Every time the story would get cliched or too serious, the puppet action (sometimes done badly on purpose) would bring the house down.  They build up to the first street fight in Paris, and the puppet fighting looks like two guys doing the lambada.  The much-hyped sex scene resembled a Ken and Barbie porno.  They introduced panthers in a North Korean palace scene, which were played by ordinary housecats who tore up two of the \\"Hollywood Left\\" puppets. <br /> <br />As with most episodes of South Park, they ridicule both Left and Right, with the Left catching sharper elbows.  The Hollywood Left is represented by the \\"Film Actors Guild,\\" and the soundbites from the actors feature their names and the guild's acronym on the chyron bar across the bottom of the screen.  Michael Moore is a slob turned suicide bomber, while Alec Baldwin and the other actors are tools of the terrorists.  The overall point of the satire: America and the political Right need to be less arrogant and ham-handed in dealing with the rest of the world, while the anti-war crowd and political Left need to defend America's greatness and not give aid and comfort to those who seek to destroy it. <br /> <br />This is one of those movies that if you like it the first time, you'll want to see it three or four more times and then purchase the DVD.  That way, you'll pick up some of the more subtle jokes that you missed while apologizing and cleaning off the back of the guy you sprayed Coke on when you saw Kim Jong Il shoot his translator in the back of the head after receiving bad news from a terrorist.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Winner of Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Picture, Best Actor (Kevin Spacey), Best Cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) , Best Screenplay (Alan Ball), and Best Director (Sam Mendes), this genre-defying film appears, on the surface, to be a typical domestic drama, filled with black humor and containing a coming-of-age subplot--and then it becomes surreal.  Lester Burnham (Spacey), like all the other characters in the film, is unhappy and alienated.  He hates his job, dislikes his bosses, and resents his hostile and driven wife, but when he finally frees himself from his desk job and takes a job at a fast food establishment, everything in his life goes crazy.<br /><br />Lester is not-so-secretly attracted to the bored, teenage friend (the flirty Mena Suvari) of his daughter (beautifully played by Thora Birch).  His wife (Annette Bening) has shut herself off from him, and initiates a tawdry affair.  His alienated daughter is attracted to the equally alienated, drug-selling teenager (Wes Bentley) next door, a boy who has just been released from a two-year hospitalization and who stands outside her house shooting videos.  The boy's father (Chris Cooper), an ex-Marine, rules the family with an ungloved fist.<br /><br />The Burnhams and the Fittses, next door, appear at first to be fairly typical suburban families, living typical suburban lives, but as these alienated people try, first, to cope with their alienation and then figure out a way to resolve it, the film becomes darkly surreal.  Each character chooses to cope in an extreme way, a way that would not make sense for  the \\"typical\\" families which they appear to represent, and eventually the characters, acting on their extreme choices, collide in a dramatic, horrifying conclusion.<br /><br />Director Mendes somehow manages to make this genre-bending film work, creating a likable character in Lester (Spacey), a termagant wife (Bening) who manages to elicit a modicum of sympathy, and teenagers who exhibit the typical angst of their age while, at the same time, evoking our own tender memories.  Even the domineering Col. Fitts becomes human as we see him trying to cope with his own threatening demons.  The drama builds slowly, the tension rises inexorably, and the final scenes are intense.  Astonishingly, even the final scene has elements of black humor.  With all its Academy Awards, and its additional Academy nominations for Best Actress, Best Music, and Best Editing, this is a top-notch film which will interest film buffs and lovers of dark comedy, and its \\"heart\\" makes it unforgettable.

B000002H33|5.0|Metallica, for starters, is, and always will be, in my mind, the greatest band of all time. An this album was Metallica at their absolute best. The tracks:<BR>&quot;Battery&quot;-A great song to kick off an album, it's fast and hard-hitting.<BR>&quot;Master of Puppets&quot;-A classic, Metallica's take on drug abuse slips gracefully from smooth melodies to heavy riffs.<BR>&quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;-Another great, this one carries on the powerful tone of the first two tracks.<BR>&quot;Welcome Home(Sanitarium)&quot;-Metallica's lyrical description of insanity is presented wonderfully in this smooth/hard assault on our senses.<BR>&quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;-Perhaps the weakest song on the album, it is still by no means a disappointment.<BR>&quot;Leper Messiah&quot;-One of my alltime favourite songs, this<BR>'religious' tune contains one of the coolest beats in a metal track.<BR>&quot;Orion&quot;-In my mind, the best of the Metallica instrumental tracks.<BR>&quot;Damage, Inc.&quot;-A great ass-kicking anthem, this closes the album off with feeling.

6305079811|3.0|This review is based upon the 2004 Studio Canal Region 2,4 releases. <br /> <br />I'd been thinking of trying to find this for a while, and hadn't been able to, here in New Zealand. Just saw it yesterday (budget price) and bought it. I've had the soundtrack since the movie came out and loved it. Saw the movie on the big screen once when I was a kid also. I didn't much remember what it looked like, but I see that kids can be very forgiving...lol <br /> <br />It is very cheesy. Considering that the movie came out after StarWars and around the same time as Empire Strikes Back, I'd have thought the special effects could have been better, but the guys who did them sure ain't Lucasfilm. <br />The spaceship effects are only marginally better than the 'detergent bottle on a string' of the black and white Buster Crabbe serials of the 1940's, and yet there's something endearing about it all. <br /> <br />This 2004 release has none of the scratches that someone mentioned in a previous review. Video looks very clean. The sound is in 5.1, and picture in 2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen. I don't have a 5.1 audio system, but the sound overall seems very flat, like there's no bass; this is a pity as you don't get the full power from Queen's great soundtrack. <br /> <br />Overall, if you liked it when you were young, you're going to have to buy it, aren't you? It's worth it, at the mid-price range (I paid NZ$14.95 at Whitcoulls). <br /> <br />
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The final chapter of the Matrix trilogy has gotten a lot of negative votes from so many people since it came out.  People went in expecting a revolution, and came out unbelivably dissapointed.  Get over it, because no matrix sequel is going to be as good as the first movie.  I am here to discuss why I believe the Matrix Revolutions does not suck. <br /> <br />Be warned that in order to explain my points, I have to discuss scenes from the movie, so I'm issuing a MAJOR MAJOR SUPER DUPER SPOILER warning.  Go and see the movie, then come back to read. <br /> <br />Things that people hate: <br /> <br />The Trainman:  At the beginning of the movie, the big villian is some scruffy fellow named the trainman.  He's very important, punches Neo, is crucial to the whole plot...and then dissapears.  The point?...hmm...OK, I guess the fans are right on this one.  He sucks. <br /> <br />The Merovingian:  I still hate this guy, and everything associated with him.  His bondage club is supposed to symbolize Neo's friends going through hell to rescue him.  Why did Trinity not shoot him? <br /> <br />The Merovingian:  Bring me ze eyes of ze oracle (eats olive in a snotty way), and I vill give you back your savior!  Awwwhhhaaa!!!! <br /> <br />Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph:  F*** you <br /> <br />(They open fire and blast the Merovingian to bits) <br /> <br />The battle of Zion:  Lots of people complain about this scene being too long and too boring.  Well, the quest to save Zion is what this whole trilogy is about.  You expect them to show the scene in under ten minutes?  Aint gonna happen.  They have to show that the future of Zion is being fought for.  For those who think the machines are stupid for flying around endlessy instead of attacking, the scene would last maybe thirty seconds to a minute at max if they all broke off and attacked.  It would be interesting, but really short and almost certianly unsatisfying.  And I think it's a good idea that the filmmakers did not show Neo andTrinity.  The focus needs to be on Zion at this point in the movie, and not showing Neo and Trinity keeps the audience wondering what happened to them.  And it would be pretty boring to show the Logos zipping through the tunnels while Neo and Trinity twiddle thier thumbs while searching for the exit. <br /> <br />Too many side charachters being given main roles:  This series is about lots of people of vastly different backgrounds coming togehter to fight for a common cause, namly the freedom of humanity.  We get to see battles from minor charachters points of view while they try desperatly to save thier city.  Mifune barely showed up in the second movie, yet he shines here as he battles the sentinels.  Zee, the Kid, Charra, and Niobe also do really well in thier own parts to save Zion.  But I will admit that it is a bit sad to see that the great Morpheus has almost nothing to do except talk wisley and wear a sweater. <br /> <br />Trinity's Death is too long:  This one irks me the most that people complain and whine about this scene being too long.  Well people, Trinity's been skewered by a lot of pipes.  She's bleeding to death.  For those of you who don't know, bleeding to death is a slow death.  It takes about three to four minnutes to die that way.  While she is dying, Trinity knows that she has to tell Neo what she's been trying to tell him the entire trilogy.  That she loves him.  Now she has her final chance to tell him, and she makes full use of it.  And she's a major charachter.  She's been in all three movies, and we need to say goodbye to her.  I garantee that all of you would whine and complain if she died in say, a minute.  You would all complain that her death is too short.  There is just no pleasing some people <br /> <br />Stupid dialoge:  Come on people, are you all expecting Shakesphere or something?  This stuff sounds fine to me.  Bane/Smith's rants about \\"Who am I?\\"  Fits his mechanical charachter perfectly.  I still fail to see why people hate the \\"fake\\" dialoge.   <br /> <br />The Ending:  Ah yes, the one thing that everybody hates.  This is your final MAJOR MAJOR SUPER DUPER SPOILER warning.  Now, about the ending.  Instead of seeing all the machines dead and destroyed, we now have a peace between the humans.  A lot of people say that the Matrix is essentially back where it started, The Matrix is still up and running, and the machines still control humans.  But I ask you to consider the following points. <br />1.  For the first time in what be thousands of years, there is peace between humans and machines.  For the first time, they are not trying to kill each other.  Peace is much better then war. <br />2.  The People of the Matrix now have choice.  Although we dont see it, we now know that residents of the Matrix know that thier world is all an illusion.  They now have the choice to stay in the Matrix, or if they wish, they can leave to go to Zion.  But either way, they now have a choice, which they did not have before.   <br />3.  Morpheus has said that Neo would bring around the end of the war.  And he was right.  Neo ended the war, exactly like Morpheus said.  I dont recall hearing anybody say that Neo would destroy the machines, he would simply end the war.  <br />4.  If Neo did destroy the Machines, then what would happen to all the people in the Matrix?  They would be suddenly ripped out of thier comfortable lives, and would live in a harsh, pretty much uninhabitable world.  Millions of them would undoubtebly go insane and die.  And would the rest be really any better off?  Millions more would starve to death, or die due to the conditions in the real world.  There is no way Zion could support billions of people.  <br />Oh, and no matter how many times I watch it, the last shot of the movie is still incredibly cheesy. <br /> <br />In conclusion, you really need to read and research to understand this movie fully.  If you just go in to enjoy the movie and ignore any preconcieved notions about it, then you should have fun.  It's a great action movie.  The fight and battle scenes were amazing and a lot of fun to watch.  The filmmakers did all they could to make a movie that would satisfy people.  If you really dig deep enough, you will see that they ended the series in the best way possible.  Who knows, we might have gotten this: <br /> <br />Neo stands over the dead body of Smith, and everyone is saved. <br /> <br />Oracle:  You did it Neo!  What are you going to do next? <br /> <br />a copy of THE MATRIX ONLINE zips into Neo's hand.   <br /> <br />Neo:  I'm going to continue my adventures in the Matrix for only $49.99! <br /> <br />Neo turns to the camera <br /> <br />Neo:  Dont miss it! <br /> <br />The sun rises, bunnies nibble on grass, everybody smiles and happy bombastic music plays. <br /> <br />THE END
B000000JO3|5.0|A good way to get acquainted with Minor Threat is to watch their live performance on the hardcore documentary \\"Another State of Mind.\\"  Singer Ian Mackaye doesn't have a microphone but performs anyway, relying on the audience to help him shout the lyrics above the music.  Of course everyone in the crowd, which packed the venue from wall to wall, knew every word of the lyrics and helped make them audible over the extremely loud music.  If the intensity of that performance doesn't convince you that Minor Threat is pure hardcore, then you don't know what hardcore is.  After watching that show, you will clearly understand the recordings of Minor Threat and will have no trouble digesting it.  The \\"Complete Discography\\" compiles the most important hardcore records ever and doesn't have one bad song on it.  The youthful anger is transferred into music perfectly.  While Bad Brains may have shown these young men how punk could be done, Minor Threat easily surpassed their mentors with every song they wrote.  Bad Brains were grown men and could not convey youthful angst like Minor Threat could.  Bad Brains sounds like Easy Listening music compared to Minor Threat.  The straight edge lifestyle they originated may not seem all that special, especially in the eighties, until you realize that they're still anti-authority all the way.  Being clean and sober made them more effective rebels.  Plus, it was a middle finger to the mainstream rock establishment who seem to believe that creativity could only be spawned with the use of drugs.  Minor Threat proved that a person in a natural state of mind could make the most emotional and intense music.    Part of their straight edge lyrical philosophy included sex, religion, and consumerism as mind numbing agents also.  MacKaye was about full force confrontation of the real world, which is still a revolutionary stance to this day.  They also had a clever sense of humor as can be heard on songs like \\"Steppin' Stone,\\" Cashing In,\\" and \\"Sob Story,\\" which are wheel barrels of fun.  Aside from the brilliant lyrical content, the music just rips.  The aggression comes through in the hyper speed levels they play at and short length of the songs leave you hungry for more.  The low budget production and imperfections actually make it even more powerful in a reckless sort of way.  Every song is an adrenaline rush of therapeutic anger.  Minor Threat influenced the entire hardcore scene with their point of view and spawned countless imitators to this day.  SSD, Gorilla Biscuits, and Youth Of Today are vastly inferior to Minor Threat.  MacKaye's next full-time project, Fugazi, started out great but slowly drifted into being another mediocre Indie rock band of the nineties.  When a band starts out this great, it's pretty much impossible to keep it up for the years to come.  However, we have these recordings to remember how much substance hardcore had at one time.
0142000663|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, which is surprising because it was a summer reading book.  I don't really know why I liked it.  Maybe it was because you really got into the story and wanted to know what would happen to the Joads.  Or maybe it was because you just really liked all the dynamic characters.  Well, whatever it was, it made the book great.  So... READ IT!!!
B0002IU988|5.0|I must say that being a semi-fan of Creed, I didn't expect to like this CD very much. However, I was dead wrong. This time around, the ex-Creed members got everything right: Tremonti is given so much more freedom, and he dominates with it. Myles Kennedy, the new front man, is better vocally than Scott Stapp ever was, and his range is incredible.  <br />Lyrically, this is one of the best CDs I've ever heard. All of the songs were carried the same essentail underlying message, but each one expressed that theme differently. <br />Musically, what can I say, great riffs, the drum work is awesome, and Kennedy holds it all together with his great vocals (Not to mention a pro bassist...forgot his name.) <br />1. Find The Real- 4/5- Not my favorite song on the CD. Lyrically sound, but I don't like the way this one was executed. However, a good end solo make it worth it. <br /> <br />2. One Day Remains- 5/5- Great. Tremonti has a great riff and solo here. Kennedy displays his amazing vocals here, and this is probably the best drummed song on the CD. <br /> <br />3. Open You Eyes- 5/5- Beautiful song that has deep yrical meaning and another great solo by Tremonti...are you picing up a trend here? Also, the version on Madden 2005 is shortened greatly, and takes alot away from the song. Don't judge it based on that. <br /> <br />4. Find The Real- 5/5- The slowest song on the CD, also the most sober and dark lyrically. Still great though, a nice pace-changer in between Open Your Eyes and Metalingus <br /> <br />5. Metalingus- 3/5- The hardest song...Also my least favorite. Not because it WAS harder, but because except for Kennedy's vocals, there was nothing significant about it, it was pretty generic.  <br /> <br />6. On Broken Wings- 5/5- I can't quite put my finger on what made this one so good...listen for yourself, all I can say is that I love it. <br /> <br />7. In Loving Memory- 5/5- While not the best song on the CD musically, it blows everything else away lyrically. It itparticularly close to home for me having lost a close friend myself recently, so maybe that's it. Still beautifully written and sung. <br /> <br />8. Down To My Last- 5/5- Gets back to the great guitar work of Tremonti, another great riff for him. <br /> <br />9. Watch Your Words- 4/5- Good musically, but one of Kennedy's weaker vocal and lyrical songs here. <br /> <br />10. Shed My Skin- 5/5- Really a testament to how good Kennedy is here, more than anything. The vocals here are amazing, especially at the end of the song. I'd kil lto be able to do that. <br /> <br />11. The End Is Here- 4/5- Sadly, yes, the end is here. Not a blow-you-away kind of song, but it wasn't meant to be. Still a good closer with a unique riff and good lyrics, as usual. <br /> <br />Yes, I know it sounds like I'm a fanboy with my shameless promotion of those two band members, but I'm not lying...it's that good. While I'm not sticking them up there with Zeppelin or Hendrix just yet, I will say that this debut album has impressed me more than anytinhg in the past 10 years, since Sublime's 40 oz. To Freedom.  <br />Another song or two might have been nice, can't wait for their sophomore album.

B0002MPU1K|1.0|I'd heard a lot about this artist, and thought that there must be some substance to the hype, but alas, such is not the case. Cincotti's voice is bland and poorly controlled, and his piano playing pedestrian. Such songs as \\"I Love Paris\\" and \\"Bali Hai\\" are almost laughable. Too bad that this young man became a star before he's had a chance to develop his modest talents.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie works -- big time -- due to a superb cast, amazing fight scenes, a well-written story that captures you emotionally, and excellent production values (direction, photography, editing, etc.)  Well well done.  Also, the score will blow you away.  Christian Bale should have been nominated for some award for his work in this movie -- he is brilliant.  It's so hard to make all the pieces come together in a movie, that for Wimmer to have accomplished this with limited resources is amazing.  (I apologize for all the superlatives; just can't help myself.)
0452284392|3.0|The beginning of this book promises much more than what is really inside. I agree with one of the reviews that it could have been shortend a lot. The book seems to be written in a style similar to books on more important issue (for mankid, in my opinion), e.g. DNA, with (too) many personal facts of litlle momentum. In my opinion the ideas and \\"discoveries\\" reported by the author are not at this level, as the constant use of marvelous adjectives largely scattered in the book seems to suggest. I think that also a book written for the general public should consider humility as a texture on which to build this type of communication.

B00005RIKI|5.0|Words cannot explain just how amazing this album is.This is an album you can definitly listen to straight thru.All the way from the wailing opening melody of \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" to the souther fried slide-guitar offerings of \\"Freebird\\",Skynyrd shows off it's unprecedented musicianship with its triple guitar line as well as Ronnie's honest and human lyrics,which I think anyone can relate to even to this day.No other rock n roll band could maintain its cocky swagger and at the same time remain as true as Skynyrd did to their roots.If you need a break from the furious fretwork of Eddie,Joe,Jimmy,or Angus,or if you are simply looking for timeless,honest,quality rock n roll music,then Skynyrd is the band you're looking for.All of their albums up to Street Survivors is a must have.  <br /> <br />Long live Ronnie.
B000002JAX|4.0|I may not be a big fan of this kind of music or of female singers in general (take note, I'm a girl myself!) but who couldn't be charmed by this young, talented lady with a tremendous voice and be mesmerized by the leisurely beautiful melodies that make me hark back to the good ol' days (though I'm in my 20's as I'm writing this)?  Although many of the tracks here are covers of songs by Piaf and Holliday and such, Ms. Peyroux also shows up to be a good songwriter (but woe to the few number of those songs she's written herself) and performer in her own right as well.  And the music is surprisingly good--I guess I'm starting to warm myself up to those kind of genres such as jazz, blues, and a bit of country (which are my \\"problem\\" genres for a long time) and some European influences.  Choice tracks:  \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself A Letter\\", \\"La Vie En Rose\\", and the title track.  But all of the songs here are definitely worth a listen. <br /> <br />If you feel you're in for a nostalgia trip, feel a bit wistful and romantic, lounge around or just want to listen to a seriously good music, step into this dreamland and you will never regret it. <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|I  used to love metallica and have all of their albums and even the black album, i was into it but after i heard load,reload, and, it just got worse... Now metallica has released an album that has been out call \\"st anger\\" or whatever? I  just can't belive that, a once great metal  band--- Can sell themselfes out like that... It makes me wonder, if they were in it for the music in the first place.Anyways, ride the lightning by metallica is an essential, pure metal classic, and no, its not thrash, ok ? Thrash is slayer, kreator, and others---Metallica was  just plain real melodic, epic metal that has turn into garbage because of money and the mainstream. I highy recommend, if your still haven't bought it...That means you dont know nothing about metal? So, go buy it and learn how real metal sounds and throw your rap/nu-metal albums, where it belongs...In the dump !
B00005JMXX|3.0|After puttin to much polution in the Earth, it decides to repair itself.  Denny quaid is tryin to lay some knowledge on the vice prez, but all he gets is a pat on the rump and the door. So the Earth creates a super storm that brings with it a new ice age. As everyone chokes on reality, most flee to Mexico where its warm. Denny has to go to New York cause his son and his squeeze are trapped and gettin ready to get the freeze on. Special effects are kool and my rental disc was a fine transfer. Not to many extras though. Both a DTS and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack are available. Your sub-woofer gets a workout in this one. One side note, the way this event all plays out is pretty hard to belive so if you like a movie to be more realistic you might not like this one. Alot of liberties were taken.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This album is right up there with any greatest hits albums. Since B bands with 2 albums have greatest hits albums, this collection by a classic artist is worth the investment. You'll just love reliving these old songs.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|When I went to see this in the theatre I didn't know what to expect. I even thought \\"Oh geez did I just waste my money?\\". Boy, was I EVER wrong.  I never leave a movie for anything, but I was laughing so hard I had to use the bathroom. Jared Hess's role is brilliant, funny, heart-warming and just down right hysterical!!! I loved it! This is a great movie to add to your collection. I know I definitely am!
B00006RAKP|5.0|The early songs like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, Your Song and Daniel to the 80's hits like I Guess That's Why They Call it the Blues and Nikkita to the newer songs like The One and the Circle of Life. This CD has it all.
0316096199|5.0|Lucky, by Alice Sebold is a heart-wrenching book that will make people look at their lives in a new way. Lucky is about a young woman who gets raped in her college years, and is trying to cope with the catastrophic events her life is throwing at her. Lucky is so enlightening because no one ever thinks  that bad things will happen to them, but this book show every one that horrible things can happen to anyone.

B00005JK8K|3.0|This a watchable film, however, given the subject matter it should have been more compelling than it is.  Give credit to the main actors, Nicolas Cage and Adam Beach, for breathing whatever life the director, John Woo, and the screenwriters couldn't to this movie.  The title of the film is \\"Windtalkers\\" but it may as well have been titled \\"Cliched World War II\\" movie.  The film is more concerned with battle sequences (a.k.a. big explosions) than the subject it purports to be about.  There are only cursory scenes that involve the training of the Navajo code-talkers.  What follows are scenes with the platoon that consist of virtually every ethnic stereotype including the resident bigot followed by one battle scene after another.  It's a shame because this film should have been so much more.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album should be studied in universities.  It's a record that transcends outside of it's genre and should be owned by ANY music fan, even non-hip hop followers.  Everyone reading this should go on a search engine and print out the lyrics to Illmatic, it's poetry.  This record is the pure essence of hip hop, an art which is more than just music. <br /> <br />My love for hip hop has faded but it's still there, friends say it's because I've reached my mid-twenties and changed, but that has nothing to do with it.  In the time of \\"Illmatic\\", the game was flourishing, nowadays there a great MCs, but you usually got to find them on mixtapes, you don't see them on MTV.  Of course, there are exceptions.  \\"But I'm a take her back hoping that the s**t stops...\\" this album is one of the 10 greatest hip hop records of all time, and it won't EVER fall out of that position.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001GRZ|5.0|Every time I listen to these performances I understand more and more about Bach and his cello suites.  Fournier really knows these pieces and he communicates the music, the dance, the structure, the emotion and the profundity to such a degree that is really incomparable that I've experienced so far!<br /><br />The recording is so natural and broad that it feels like he's in the room playing for you himself!
B000067CPX|4.0|With the latest Chilli Peppers release, fans see the veteran group experiment with a \\"softer\\" approach.  It's not soft, but it is compared to the 80's funk records they put out.  However, new sounds don't neccessarily mean bad things, as I feel \\"By the Way\\" still captures that special energy that the band always bring to the table.  No, it's not their strongest work, but it's a very solid LP and they still have the greatest bassist to roam the planet in Flea, and one of my favorite guitarists in John Frusciante.  However, the record does suffer some familiar woes that have plagued some of their past catalogue.  Anthony Kiedis is a great front man, but his lyrics are lacking in some of the tracks, and there are too many fillers here.  At this stage in their career I feel it's safe to call them legends, and they should put out an album of 12-13 very solid tracks.  However, a few mistakes don't overshadow a very good effort. <br /> <br />Two things that don't bother me but I find a little strange is, people calling this \\"their greatest album ever\\" and going furthur and calling this \\"a masterpiece and the best album ever made.\\"  Ok, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" is a masterpiece, Led Zeppelin's \\"IV\\" album, Nirvanna's \\"Nevermind\\", u2's \\"Achtung Baby,\\"...masterpieces.  This isn't \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" everyone.  But I know how people get excited, I just wanted to share my thought. <br /> <br />\\"By the Way\\" is a great track to start off the record, great in-your-face tune, don't have to say Flea does well with this because he always does.  Kiedis has great delivery here, but the album hits it's first valley early with \\"Universally Speaking,\\" a solid tune but doesn't really do anything for me.   <br /> <br />The next songs are classic Chilli peppers, and the strongest part of the record.  \\"This is my place\\" displays brilliant lyrics and singing by Anthony...emotional tune, and it's followed by \\"Dosed,\\" which I feel is a perfect ballad, and Frusciante's guitar play, although minimalist compared to his other works, is absolutely hypnotic and untouchable.  The next is \\"Don't Forget Me,\\" maybe my favorite on the new CD.  One of those tracks where the whole band come to play, they all shine.  The next two tracks were singles, \\"Zephyr Song\\" and \\"Can't Stop.\\"  The former is a decent tune, and although very catchy, it gets tired and has kind of \\"easy\\" lyrics.  It's no \\"Could have lied.\\"  The latter is another energetic track, love it.  Anthony could have mumbled the whole song, the first 30 second build up and Frusciante's guitar make it addictive enough.   <br /> <br />The rest of this album is full of fillers.  \\"Midnight\\" is a b-side at best, and I have no problem with tracks that are just supposed to be fun, but \\"Cabron\\" is just annoying. \\"Minor thing\\" is another track they could have done without, and I never got into \\"Throw away your television,\\" although I thought it came to life when performed live.  That being said, there are really good moments on the second half, \\"Tear\\" is amazing and \\"Warm Tape\\" is pretty great, something different.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is a very solid record, even a great one, but not a classic.  I might have given it three stars, but because of Frusciante's guitar work I'll raise it a notch.  Yes, I miss the funk days of old but there's nothing more refreshing to me than a band that evolves and experiments with different sounds.  They'll be around for awhile, they got a couple more funk records still in them.  These guys are just getting started, incredible band.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0142004235|5.0|I love this book - but I feel a certain shame about the Oprah book club logo. This book stands as a masterpiece without any endorsements from a pop icon (fad if you will). For someone like Oprah to vainly attatch her name to piece of art is kind of like blasphemy (though oddly enough I don't consider myself religous).  Does anyone else out there think it is distasteful to attatch your name to a classic and sell it around the world -as if the book wasn't capable of communicating on its own? Steinbeck is a great author - and he is not to be insulted by this horrid oprah book club logo - restore his works properly like any respectable artist!
0553106635|5.0|I just have one little comment to make about other peoples negative reviews of this series (fortunately there arent many, or else id think mankind is going insane), specifically the parts about \\"all the heroes dying, and extreme sex and violence\\".  News flash: FAIRYTALES ARENT REAL!  If you cant handle the comings and goings in this series then you probably cannot handle life and therefore shouldnt be spending your precious sheltered time reading fantasy novels! Get a grip people. Sex, violence, and death are all included in what makes the world go round, so if you dont like it my only advice is to go star in a Disney movie.
B00005JMJG|1.0|I am empowered and I have to agree with the last reviewer. I heard this dork of a screenwriter say that one of the messages is that we don't experience true love until we submit to its possibility. Well, I say we should diversify our experiences with different people and different kinds of people. Why not test the idea of love itself instead of just freaking assuming its some pie in the sky thing that actually exists! Makes me so mad.
B000001FS3|1.0|They just do dreary brit pop they aren't even a propper rock band. they win awards for best rock band of the decade or whatever on all those dumb award programs and get voted by pop-listening douche's and people who like them because they think they should. The just do dreary melodies and bonos voice is sickly and boring and they.......just.......suck!! <br />I am over the age of 3
B000002HHB|5.0|I admit that 10, 000 Maniacs and REM were about as hard core as I ever got. Didn't really get into the Stones when I was younger or the whole grunge scene when I was older. But for me this is one rocking album. \\"Wonder\\" is a classic song.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie was incredible I can't belive yesterday was the first time I saw it. How could have been so stupid?!?!?
B00005JNEI|4.0|You either hate it or love it.  Thats basically the sum of the reviews for this film (those of you who've posted a review but have stated clearly you refuse to ever watch the film, are waisting the time of people who actually want an honest opinion.  Go tread somewhere else). <br /> <br />Michael Moore's film comes at a time in our country where political commentary and reporting have reached an all-time low.  In this day and age, we as Americans are forced biased politcal view from every media outlet available, including films.  This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on who you are listening to.  Michael Moore does not hide his political agenda at all, and does not mix intentions.  It's for this reason, he and his film have been labaled \\"anti-American\\".  However, in my mind, this is as American as it gets.  Right or wrong, Left or Right, Red or Blue, whichever way you swing in politics, you owe it to yourself to watch this film.  Even if you come away from it with nothing but hatred for Moore, isn't it worth that much to solidify your beliefs?  As an American, I want to know everything I can, and the things that Michael Moore explores in this film, are only one piece of the overall pie when it comes to American Politics. <br /> <br />I loved this film's intentions, as I do most of Moore's other films.  That does not mean I (or any American) hate this country, or the people in charge of it.  To me, what it means, and what Moore represents, is the voice from the other side.  A different point of view.  The silent majority if you will.  I don't always agree with the things Moore says or does, but I truly respect the fact that he is out there, doing what he does, because no one else is, and we NEED someone out there ruffling feathers. <br /> <br />In terms of the film itself, and the quality of it, I still enjoyed it.  It was funny, scary, depressing, and ultimately, very informative.  I thought it tried a little too much at times, given the broad scope of charges Moore heads up, and would have probably enjoyed another 45 minutes or so to back-up some of the things mentioned.  That's not to say I believe Moore is not being 100% honest with us, it simply meens I wished for a more complete documentary given the topics at hand (I've the feeling that certain parts of the film's research and production value took a back seat to the turn-around time Moore had to get the movie in the theaters and finally into your homes pre-04 election, which he ultimately did) <br /> <br />Bottom Line, every American owes it to themselves to at least watch the film, and make your own opininon.  I feel sorry for the people that bash it without having even watched it!  Those are the truly pathetic people of this country, so blinded by agenda, and personal beliefs that they refuse to even entertain the possiblity of anothers point of view.  Thats as anti-America as you can get.  If you've seen any of Michael Moore's previous films, you know what to expect.  If you believe everything the Bush organization tells you, then you have no idea what to expect.
B00007LTIB|5.0|\\"Relayer\\" is, quite possibly, the definitive Yes album.  Yet it is mired in relative obscurity compared to Fragile or Close to the Edge.  This is believable given the circumstances.  Rick Wakeman was gone (a sad loss and a handicap, in most people's eyes).  \\"Relayer\\" followed the ponderous, overblown \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\".  Fans were wondering if Yes had strayed too far from that classic sound that defined prog-rock in the '70s.  Nevertheless, in steps Patrick Moraz and he nails it!  The densely layered synthesizers, obtuse lyrics and complex guitar bridges could easily have been pretentious.  Instead, brilliant musicianship and razor-sharp production gelled into a masterpiece.  I have always loved Steve Howe's guitar playing!  Only David Gilmour, Page or maybe Pete Townsend could have approached him in that era.  \\"The Gates of Delirium\\" could not have been a better title.  The schizophrenic time-signature changes and puzzling lyrics always leave me spinning ouy of my mind.  \\"To Be Over\\" never fails to sedate me --  like I'm flowing down a lazy river in a Dean landscape.  So melodic and compelling.  If you love '70s prog-rock like I do (Porcupine Tree fans listen up), then \\"Relayer\\" is essential to your collection.
0385507755|5.0|I stumbled upon this book in the bookstore and only picked it up to marvel at the cover.  Imagine my surprise when I opened up the first page to see what it was about and actually made it to the second without putting it down.   <br /> <br />\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" -- Frey's first book I believe -- is really a masterpiece.  The author has been some places that would make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  An alcoholic, Frey ends up in rehab after an \\"accident\\" during a blackout he was lucky to live through.  Immediately, we can tell that Frey is not going to be a big group-hug kind of guy and that he very well might not even stick around to eat a meal in the place.  Unlike many sugar coated I'm-going-to-rehab-to-get-better books, Frey gets to the pretty terrifying heart of his feelings -- and we're lucky to be in on his journey.   <br /> <br />Self-hatred, love, and a boatload of redemption are what you're in for if you read Frey's \\"A Million Little Pieces.\\"  Its a good book, and a good ride to tag along on.
0446310786|5.0|It is told form the perspective of a young lady daughter of a lawyer in the south around 1930.   He is called to defend a black man who is accused of raping a white young lady.  The fact that someone was black meant that the courts at that time would inevitably find them guilty of the crime, which would mean that the trial would be a joke.  Things could only get worse for this African- American man accused of the crime.  It is good to learn the struggle,  because it shows how bad certain people had it at a certain point in time.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I am no movie buff.  And, until I saw this movie (and \\"The Truman Show\\", but that's another story completely), I hated Jim Carrey.  I thought he was basically talentless with the exception of the rubber-face thing he has going.   <br /> <br />\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" is basically a complicated love story with some crazy side plots mixed in.  Joel and Clementine meet, as it turns out, not for the first time; they had a relationship in the past that was a bit bumpy.  Clementine got all of her memories of Joel literally *erased* from her mind, and, for revenge, Joel does the same thing to her.   <br /> <br />I'm not going to tell you what happens in the end of the movie, but I will say that \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" will really have you thinking....are we nothing BUT our memories?  Can our heart really and truly \\"override\\" our brain?  Or does our brain rule our heart?  I'm not saying that this movie will ANSWER any of these questions, but the best movies and books just help us to find a bit of truth in this world....
B0001FGBL6|5.0|I've had this album since it came out, and everytime i listen to it i like it more.<br />It is just simply amazing.<br />Metal combined with classic, with a movie-score type mix, and some good lyrics that reflect fresh views about the world, i cannot say enough good things about this band.
B0002KPHXS|4.0|Intermezzo is the brilliant American adaptation of the Swedish film by the same name. Enamored by her on screen presence in that film, producer David O. Selznick imported Ingrid Bergman to Hollywood; a rare an ever-lasting find that audiences the world over should be eternally grateful for. As in the Swedish version, Bergman plays Anita Hoffman, a gifted piano teacher who comes in contact with violin virtuoso, Holger Brandt (Leslie Howard). Though Selznick wanted Howard in the film, Howard only agreed after Selznick acquiesced to giving him co-producer screen credit for his efforts. Brandt's world tours keep in away from his committed wife, Margit (Edna Best) and children. The realization that his own life is passing him by is spurred on when Brandt discovers that he is falling in love with Anita. A bittersweet Riviera tryst reforms the illicit lovers to their separate destinies. Selznick's impenetrable commitment to top of the line production values and his way of concocting dreamy gloss from human stories, make \\"Intermezzo\\" a viscerally moving poignant experience. Bring Kleenex. <br /> <br />MGM's DVD is rather impressive. The B&W picture exhibits a very nicely balanced gray scale with smooth, solid blacks and very clean whites. Age related artifacts are present throughout but do not distract. Some minor edge enhancement crops up but pixelization is kept to a minimum. Overall the picture will surely not disappoint. The audio is mono but more than adequate for a film of this vintage. There are no extras. <br />

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of the coolest movies to ever slip past the average filmgoer. Each scene is classic and no moment is wasted on filler. My only regret is that it only lasted two weeks in my theater. I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
B000002IZ4|5.0|1994's \\"Purple\\" retains the heavy guitar sound of their debut, but adds a much more colorful palate of influences along with it.    There's grinding, confrontational songs like \\"Meatplow\\", \\"Silvergun Superman\\", and the brooding \\"Lounge Fly\\". They're all heavy, but ripe with infectious radio hooks.     Songs like \\"Vasoline\\" and \\"Unglued\\" are very fast and intense, but also incredibly catchy. Both also contain wicked guitar solos.    \\"Internstate Love Song\\" is a modern rock classic. It's breezy and pop friendly, but it still rocks at the same time. The main guitar riff is so catchy that it alone becomes the song's hook.     \\"Still Remains\\" is just..WOW. A glorious meeting of the ways between dream-pop, carefree psychadelia, and rock. Scott Weiland gives a passionate vocal performance on this one.    \\"Kitchenware & Candybars\\" is another un-Core sounding song with meditative, accoustic verses and a swirling chorus. The bridge in particular is very majestic with its orchestral flourishes.    Other highlights include the introspective \\"Big Empty\\" (which perfects the soft/loud dynamics) and the raucous \\"Army Ants\\".      If you don't already own this album, please..do so. It's STP's most consistent album, bridging the gap between the grunge sound of their debut album \\"Core\\", and the more experimental pop/psychedelic/etc influenced music of their later albums.     Best Songs: Interstate Love Song, Still Remains, Big Empty, Kitchenware & Candybars, Lounge Fly.
0393035158|5.0|Like most religious fanatics - any disagreement with their belief system causes them to attack ignorantly. Sam Harris presents a logical argument against \\"faith\\". Every religious person who has reviewed this book values his or her \\"faith\\". As a society, we see \\"faith\\" as a virtue, but \\"faith\\" - by definition - is an acceptance of a premise that is not based on fact. We do not talk about \\"faith\\" when we discuss gravity or physics. They do not need faith to exist - they exist whether we understand them, acknowledge them, or believe in them. <br /> <br />It does not matter that Galileo renounced his \\"belief\\" that the earth orbited the sun, and not vise versa. He proved it scientifically, and it is irrefutable regardless of what anyone \\"believes\\". Such is the difference between \\"science\\" and \\"faith\\".  <br /> <br />There was a time when people believed in \\"Ra\\" or \\"Thor\\" - those beliefs and the Gods they represented were moved to the realm of unimportant. Christianity will too, eventually fall. It may be a hundred years, or a thousand - but it will. Facts will not fade. Sam Harris's book is being attacked because it is another nail in the coffin of dead mythologies. <br /> <br />I do fault Mr. Harris slightly for reaching for the fig leaf of \\"spirituality\\" - but it is understandable. I once had a conversation with James Randi and asked why he thought people hated him so much for debunking psychics and other such frauds - he said something profound, \\"I take something away from them and I have nothing to offer in exchange\\". The truth is very bare and harsh - mythologies offer comfort. It is simply why they exist. Mr. Harris, is guilty of reaching for that scrap of whole cloth to cover the naked truth of his discoveries - but he is far less guilty than the people who score his book with a single star afraid to even read it less they see that their own beliefs and mythologies offer them no real cover. <br /> <br />One day, we will be unafraid of the truth. We will have no \\"father\\" in \\"Heaven\\" or mythical creatures to watch over us. We will be better off as a species knowing both our body of true knowledge and the limitations of that body.  <br /> <br />There will be many books in the future that echo the thoughts Mr. Harris presents, because Mr. Harris is right. (Just as Galileo was, just a Darwin, and Einstein - and others who replaced fear and ignorance with understanding and science.) However, we are far off from eliminating mythology and replacing it with rational thought completely - and Mr. Harris can offer us only a tiny foreshadowing of the far future. His book presents a foundation of rational arguments - which, by-the-way, not a single \\"reviewer\\" of 1 star has argued against logically. We are evolving as a species, but old beliefs die hard and until they do die out there will be religions and fanatics afraid to question their own myths. <br /> <br />I am sure the believers of Baal, and Zeus fought just as hard for their beliefs, for their \\"faith\\". Those beliefs are now relegated to comic books and fantasy stories. Such will be the fate of Islam, Buddhism, Judeo -Christianity and other such non-sense as well. Mr. Harris' book is a step in the right direction - if you have the intellectual honesty to read it.   <br />

B000002IOW|5.0|I can't believe it's been 15 years since I bought this album. There are earlier Rush CD's that better flaunt this trio's talent, tightness and technique - but you're not going to find a more solid set overall than this. Sounding almost more acoustic on this release, when compared to their traditional prog/hard rock sound, the band shows off a slightly different sound and side to them to be admired and treasured. This CD is in a catagory of it's own when sitting next to all other Rush music. Being a forever fan, I have to say I have listened to this album probably more than any other Rush CD, (well, Moving Pictures or 2112 may have it beat by 1 or 2 turns) but, I will continue to listen to this CD often and relish every note and lyric. Highly recommended.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|OK now I was blown away when I first heard this album... Gavin DeGraw has such an amazing voice if he'd been singing row row row your boat it would have been good... but does it stop there?  No!  He is also an amazing lyricist!  His flow and out look are so refreshing and earth level that you instantly conect!  The mix of jazz, pop, r&b, and rock create such an amazing sound... seriously blown away here! <br /> <br />Jessica
B00005JMJG|5.0|I loved this movie. It's a great scenario which shows that everything that takes place in our lives is important, being the good and the bad. I don't want to write to much, but it's a great movie showing the realization that the bad things in life are just as important as the good because the bad things also make up who we are.....
B00005JNJ7|5.0|This movie isn't meant to be political commentary, to sway voters, nor is it in any way pushing one particular political point of view. What this is is comedy. In comedy, things are made fun of. This does not mean that what is not being made fun of is being advocated. It never ceases to amaze me when people completely slag off comedy like this and The Daily Show with Jon Stewart for example, simply because of their political hobsnobbery. Learn to laugh once in a while.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|(...)  Okay, like the title says, this is a decent CD but isn't great.  I'll go over it by the songs in order...    Last Chance- It's a pretty repetetive song, and because of that it seems longer than it's 2 minute length.  It's an okay opener, but it's repetetive and generic.    Are You Gonna Be My Girl- Of course this is a great song, this is why they are popular.  Listening to the repetetive first track is okay when you know this is coming up next.    Rollover D.J.- This is one of those songs that has a catchy chorus that's repeated a few times, but overall the song isn't anything spectacular.  Keeps the energy going from Are You Gonna Be My Girl.    Look What You've Done- A slow song with piano and all that.  Really slows everything down, which is a good idea after three tracks of loud, fast music.  I don't find it boring, which is the main thing that kills slow songs, so I think it does a good job.    Get What You Need- This track gets back to rocking, which is a good idea since that's why you bought the CD.  The song is really long, but at this point listening to the CD you just kinda zone out or don't pay attention to it, and it keeps on rocking like you expect it to.  By itself though, it's too long.    Move On- This is the only other slow song I like on the CD.  The thing is, and I'm not sure completely why, but it really really reminds me of Pink Floyd's song \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  (Specifically the part in this where he says \\"Yeah, I'm gonna have to move on.  Before we meet again.\\")      This reminds me, I guess some people are saying Jet is trying too hard to emulate good classic rock, when classic rock is fine the way it is.  Classic rock is great, I don't think anything new compares, but I kinda like the idea of new CDs coming out that I can rock to, even if the old ones are better and the originals.    Radio Song- Too long and too boring.    Get Me Outta Here- Another generically good, fun, rock song.  Jet is pretty good at making good songs like thisthat are good but not great.    Cold Hard Bitch- This song is really good, it pretty much climaxes the CD before a bunch of mediocre songs.    Come Around- Okay, it's kinda nice to listen to this song after Cold Hard Bitch, just to wind you down (it's slow).  It's not a very good song though.  It's too long.  Kinda zones you out of the album.  TOO LONG.    Take It Or Leave It- Sounds like Jet, simplified, yelling and playing really loud for two minutes.  An unspectacular song.  At least they only made it two minutes long, that way I might listen to it just knowing that it won't seem to last forever.    Lazy Gun- Medium/Slow speed song.  It's okay, but like Come Around it's too long.  Zones you out of the album in the same way.  I don't like the way it seems to end about 3 minutes in, then keeps going for another minute.    Timothy- Whoo, another slow song that's 4+ minutes long.  The \\"It's not what it seems\\" and \\"Where have you been\\" sound like the \\"Look What You've done\\" in the song Look What You've Done.      ------------------------------LOOK AT THIS---------------------  Also at about 1:03 in the song (Timothy), it sounds like that part in the first track of Dark Side of the Moon, right after the scream, where the music really starts.  For a few seconds it sounds remarkably similar.  In fact, it sounds EXACTLY like it.  Subliminal message?  Easter egg?  Who knows, but this couldn't have been an accident. :O    Whoo, there.  That's my whole review.  The gist is that the CD gets an early jump with Are You Gonna Be My Girl, rides through a few songs (though you may have to skip one or two) up to Cold Hard Bitch, then it kinda just moves on with mediocre stuff up to the last track.  Not a bad CD, but not great, as I said in the beginning. (Whew, this was a long review!)    -JohnnySmash
B00003CXS4|4.0|I really wish that I could give half-star ratings, because I think this movie deserves 3 and a half stars instead of 4, but since I can't, I'll be generous and round up. <br />This movie is (I think) Guy Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels; it involves some of the same cast members and themes.  The movie follows the intersecting storylines of three main groups of people.  Criminals and boxing \\"promoters\\" Turkish (Jason Statham), his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham), and their prospects Gorgeous George (Adam Fogerty) and Mickey O'Neil (Brad Pitt), who is a Pikey or a gypsy.  Then there are the jewel thieves Sol (Lennie James), Vinny (Robbie Gee), and their getaway driver Tyrone (Ade).  Also, there are the Denovitz cousins Avi (Dennis Farina) and Doug \\"The Head\\" (Mike Reid), their courrier \\"Four-Finger\\" Frankie (Benicio Del Toro), and their muscle \\"Bullet Tooth\\" Tony (Vinnie Jones).  Also, there are two characters who transcend the groups.  There is \\"Brick Top\\" Polford (Alan Ford) and Boris \\"The Blade\\" or Boris \\"The Bullet-Dodger\\" (Rade Serbedzija).  It would be very hard to condense the intertwining stories to fit into this review, so basically, there's this 86 carat diamond that the Denovitz brothers and Boris are both hunting down.  It falls into various characters hands throughout the film, as each character finds a need for it (besides the astronomical value of it).  For example, the jewel thieves need it to pay of Brick Top because they stole from him. <br />The writing and acting for this movie were pretty good.  I mean, the story wasn't anything totally original, but Ritchie kept things interesting.  On the acting, yes, the actors did a good job, but due to thick British accents, I could barely hear a word they were saying.  As for Brad Pitt's character, the joke was that we nor the characters in the film were supposed to understand him. <br />This film is definitely not for everyone.  While I don't see it as pure British humor, in orderto enjoy it, one does need to at least be able to tolerate some British humor.  Also, not everyone will be able to follow the intersecting storylines.  But don't let me discourage you, this is a very funny movie.  I think it's one of those films where you either like it or you hate it.  So, enjoy.

0812550706|5.0|This story is great if you have ever had a teacher push you too far or if you yourself are a teacher and have tried to bring the best out of your student but didn't know how. Even if you wre the little nerd getting beat up by the classs bully.  I am not saying anyone should do to children what is done to Ender, but it is interesting to see how they turned him into a great commander while also almost making him insane.  <br /> <br />By the way, for a review above who critisized the time it would take to send the message to the fleet in real time.  <br />The writer explained how they stole alien technology after the bugger war that enabled them to send messages across the galaxy without any time laps. They even had a name for the device although I forget what it is called now. <br /> <br />This was in the new edition though and perhap was one of the fixes that the writer put in so the story would make more sense for the science fanatics.

B00008WT5E|4.0|What do you call \\"Sin City\\" and \\"Down Payment Blues\\"? Two of AC/DC's greatest songs, I'd say. The former is a bonafide anthem that the band still plays in concert, and the latter has an absolutely killer riff--one of the best in the AC/DC catalogue. POWERAGE is a fantastic album. It holds up very well against HIGH VOLTAGE, DIRTY DEEDS, and HIGHWAY TO HELL...and it's better than LET THERE BE ROCK(yes, I know it sounds like blasphemy and I know that fans the world over will vehemently disagree with me, but that's how I feel!).  <br />The second \\"side\\"(i.e., the last four songs) does drag a bit, but so do the second sides of most albums. Get POWERAGE; it's pure AC/DC and you won't be disappointed.
B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode shouldn't be here. The bizarrely extended shelf life of this Basildon four-piece has long boggled rock critics and music lovers alike - shouldn't these guys have gone out with Soft Cell? But unlike their synthpop peers of the early '80s, when the term \\"New Romantic\\" was used both often and unironically, Depeche Mode have never settled comfortably into a single niche. This makes their particular brand of noise hard to categorize (Electro-goth? Heavy dance? New Order with eyeliner?), but this genre-straddling has kept the band from fading into Reagan-era obscurity. Once they outgrew their Roland synthesizer fetish, Depeche Mode were making the best music of their career, and 1990's VIOLATOR is arguably their peak.    VIOLATOR is also a textbook exercise in keeping the listener's interest. Nine songs - long enough to satisfy your dance-rock cravings without growing tedious - work in tandem to present a unique but accessible artistic vision that stands up to repeated plays, 14 years after the album's original release.    On hits like \\"Stripped\\" and \\"People Are People\\", Depeche Mode proved to be masters of rhythm, and VIOLATOR ups the ante. \\"World In My Eyes\\" lays down a solid beat, and \\"The Sweetest Perfection\\" shuffles with an almost menacing swagger, spotlighting a killer chord progression during the chorus. But \\"Personal Jesus\\", one of the band's biggest hits, takes things to another level entirely: Just try sitting still while this ominously groovy gem works its magic. (It's also guaranteed to be the one song on the album that everyone, young or old, knows.)    \\"Halo\\" and \\"Waiting For The Night\\" are both solid numbers. The latter, almost free of percussion, creates a haunting chillout atmosphere with its airy backing instruments and evocative lyrics (\\"When everything's dark / It keeps us from the stark reality...I'm waiting for the night to fall / when everything is bearable\\"). \\"Enjoy The Silence\\", the group's biggest hit, marries goth nihilism to a dance-pop groove that's sure to make you bob your head moodily.    One of VIOLATOR's most refreshing qualities is its grace. The album succeeds primarily because it doesn't try too hard, which makes hearing it for the first time a pleasant surprise. The Mode's 1986 opus BLACK CELEBRATION, while accomplished, was also a bit of a drama queen. The songs on VIOLATOR pack an emotional wallop, but they feel honest and meaningful rather than overwrought; the focus here is more on melody than mood. And each track has its own distinct personality, so there's enough variety throughout to satisfy anyone. Whether you want to dance or sulk, VIOLATOR has something to scratch your itch.     Such an understated and enjoyable album only comes around once in a while. VIOLATOR drags post-punk angst out onto the dance floor, where it belongs, and the result is a sheer pleasure. Reach out and touch base...then pick up this album.

B0000057C5|5.0|Second album from German Electro Metal band Rammstein who combine heavy marching riffs with diverse keyboard sounds. Sehnsucht is my favourite Rammstein album, because on this album they use plenty of techno sounds. The songs are mostly compact, have simple arrangements and are as catchy as can be. Although the songs are rather simple, there is always on interesting twist in the song. Especially the keyboardist plays some interesting parts in songs like \\"Bestrafe Mich\\". In \\"Kss Mich (Fellfrosch)\\" you can hear a sample that sounds like a typical cartoon sound of a spring. Unfortunately the keyboard sound on Sehnsucht sometimes sounds rather cheap. Does the keyboardist use a cheap keyboard? The keyboard sound on the live versions on the album Live Aus Berlin sound much better. The lyrics are not everybody's cup of tea, they are sung in the German language and they deal about serious matters in a sarcastic way, but they blend perfectly with the music. The album starts out with the title track that contains heavy up-tempo guitars. \\"Engel\\" starts with a cool whistling intro and has some cool female vocals. \\"Bestrafe Mich\\" is one of my favourite tracks. There is a cool keyboard part in the middle of the song. \\"Klavier\\" is the slowest song on the album and can be compared with the epic ballad \\"Seemann\\" from the album Herzeleid. It is a very different song than the other songs on the album because it is very bombastic. On Sehnsucht there is also a cover version, namely \\"Stripped\\" from Depeche Mode. It is rather strange to hear that song being sang in English. I highly recommend Sehnsucht when you're an open-minded Metal fan.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|Robert Mcnamara was an academic who worked in the war with bomber command. He was responsible for quantitative analysis of the effect of the strategic air war. His first study found that 20% of American bomber runs over Germany were aborted largely as a result of cowardice. Mcnamara concedes that cowardice is perhaps a strong word but the reality is that US bomber groups were taking heavy casualties over Germany with 4% of planes being shot down each mission. The stark reality of those figures is that 10 missions would see 40% of the crews not return and 20 see 80% not return. As the normal tour of duty was 25 missions one could understand the response of bomber crews. One being given Mcnamara's figures Air Force General Curtis Lee May made the decision to fly personally in the lead aircraft of each mission and court marshal any crew who turned back.  <br /> <br />Later in the Japanese theatre Mcnamara did the analysis that showed high level bombing was ineffective and as a result the United States adopted a policy of targeting cities by aircraft flying at a low level dropping fire bombs. The sixty largest Japanese cities were targeted. (The exceptions being Hiroshima and Nagasaki). The cities targeted by fire bombing suffered immense casualties with 40%-50% of those cities destroyed with civilian deaths estimated from anywhere between 400,000 to millions. Mcnamara concedes that if the US had lost the war he would have been judged a war criminal.  <br /> <br />Following the war Mcnamara worked for Ford and using the same quantitative approach that he had to killing tried to sell cars. He was able to turn around the fortune of the Ford Motor company by the development of the Falcon and by making huge breakthroughs in driving safety. He then gave up his enormous salary to work as the Secretary of Defence in the Kennedy and Johnson administration.  <br /> <br />The main power of the documentary probably comes from the discussion about the Cuban Missile crisis. At the time Mcnamara had not realised how close to nuclear war the world came. On discovering the fact that the Soviets had placed missiles on Cuba the Joint Chiefs of staff suggested an air attack and invasion. This was premised on the fact that they believed there were no nuclear war heads on the island and if they acted promptly they could get rid of the missiles before any war heads arrived. What the Joints Chiefs did not know was that the Soviets had already shipped 150 war heads to the island and that Castro has urged the Soviets to use them if Cuba was attacked. The world avoided by a whisker the destruction of the southern third of the United States and presumably most of the Soviet Union.  <br /> <br />Mcnamara makes the point that war is a clumsy business. The people running it generally don't really know how to do it until they have done it for a while as shown by his examples from the Second World War. Nuclear was is just to destructive to be placed in the hands of the most rational of men because they can make the sorts of mistakes that can lead to unimaginable destruction.  <br /> <br />The documentary covers the Vietnam War as well and the style of contrasting the interview of the 85 year old Mcnamara with contemporary footage and voice recordings of him speaking to Johnstone are fascinating. After watching this you are reminded how much the work of Michael Moore is that of an artful propagandist and entertainer rather than that of a deep thinker.  <br />
B0002J4ZWS|4.0|This films is perhaps the only example of a film based on a book, that is actully slightly better than the book (novella really but who's counting hehe). I saw this one in the theaters years ago, and loved it. It's an inspiring story about redemption, but it is *not* the greatest movie of all time, sorry. Top 100, no doubt, top 10, no chance. Either way, you should love this film, almost as much as the 700+ fanatics that posted below me, so go out and buy this fine film and add it to your DvD library.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Although I do not agree with all the \\"God\\" references to Jimi, I do believe him to be one of the great guitarists of all time. This is a great collection of some of his best music and a great way to introduce new listeners to the essence of his style. I highly recommend it. To the young reviewer who called this \\"crap\\", I say this - don't measure the talent of a guitarist by the number of notes he plays. Listen to Hendrix again in a few years and see if you don't hear the heart and soul of a great musician coming through his guitar.
B00024YVJU|5.0|I have just recently bought all the Eloy CD's that they produced in the 1970's, which is the period regarded as their creative and progressive musical best.  This was their next to last studio album (back then they were albums, remember?), and was released in 1977, before their sound changed slightly, mostly due to a change in personnel on keyboards (Manfred Wieczorke 1973-1975 and Detlev Schmidtchen 1976-1979 and others after 1980).   <br /> <br />I simply much prefer the sound from the albums that came out with Schmidtchen on keyboards, secondly with Wieczorke, and much less from the 1980's and beyond.  The music from this period (1976-1979) is highly pleasurable and sometimes almost intoxicating.  It keeps reminding me of Camel from their best period, which was this same time frame - the mid to late 1970's.  It is very similar music, not too heavy/loud except occasionally (the right mix for me), very progressive and unique, extraordinarily creative, sometimes hypnotic but certainly very alive and captivating.   <br /> <br />Camel has always been one of my favorite groups, so that is why I love Eloy!  The shame is, for some unknown reasons, I was never exposed to Eloy in the 70's, but only recently introduced to them at the Austin, TX record convention last year.  Geesh!  Now I seem to making up for lost time and am enjoying every listen.   <br /> <br />This is the CD I have come to love the most by Eloy, by far!  And it always satisfies me while leaving me with a feeling I want to recapture all over again, as if I were back in time in the 70-'s when progressive music was arguably at its pinnacle. <br /> <br />If you want to experience Eloy for the first time, you may possibly wish to try to Live album, as it captures the first 8 years of music, starting off with the heavy \\"Poseidon's Creation\\", also the opening track from this CD.  Either way, if you like what you hear, if you like this kind of music, you'll be like me and want to buy all the Eloy CD's from the 1970's.   <br /> <br />I find this one to be far and away their best AND my favorite!

And that, my friends, is a hard position to achieve! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000058983|4.0|I like the feeling this album gives, its a sunny trippy delicate melodic journey back to 1968.  The melodies are in general excellent, the music is well played, yeah it doesn't rock that hard, oh well, neither do the Beach Boys.  I noticed a lot of criticism of the lyrics, I couldn't care less.  They're perhaps a little too hippy dippy but not embarrasingly so and anyway who gives a damn about lyrics?  What counts more are the melodies and arrangements, the feeling the music provides the listener. The words, as with all great rock music, are something on which to hang the melody, anything else is an added bonus.  Good lyrics combined with bad music is crap.  Bad lyrics with good music can often be quite enjoyable, Beach Boys anyone?  Its extremely rare for lyrics to be so bad that the music is unlistenable.  Good lyrics with good music is of course the best, but its not necessary for an enjoyable listening experience.  After all you don't read music, you listen to it and as far as listening experiences go Forever Changes is a real treat.  Perhaps it is dated sounding, but so are the Beatles, the Doors, Bob Dylan and the Jefferson Airplane, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, ect...  What Forever Changes is is a delightful pop album replete with great acoustic and electric guitar playing, beautiful string arangements, very good if not fantastic singing and beautiful melodies.  Its a great pop album and the bonus tracks are actually a bonus.

If you want to deliver something softer then do what Nirvana did and use acoustic guitars and soft drums, not a f***ing orchestra! MTV Unplugged should be your mentor for a better hits album and besides, you guys are [supposedly] heavy metal, so that just makes this look even worse.  <br />  I guess the FOUR HORSEMEN have decided not to RIDE THE LIGHTNING anymore and to leave their once huge METAL MILITIA fanbase behind. I'm sorry to say that the MASTER OF PUPPETS are now TRAPPED UNDER ICE just waiting for CREEPING DEATH to come and kill them. I can hear THE CALL OF KTULU calling them to come to the SANITARIUM where they belong so they dont KILL 'EM ALL anymore. FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS? Metallica of course, I hope the LEPER MESSIAH comes to SEEK AND DESTROY them. These guys just dont believe theres ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL anymore so they've decided to LOAD and then RELOAD new, terrible music. They are THE UNFORGIVEN and UNFORGIVEN II because they have made two huge mistakes: One in '96 and one in '03. Now they fill me with ST. ANGER every time I hear their new stuff which drives me completely FRANTIC. The BATTERY that powered these gods have now ESCAPED them and turned them into THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE so they no longer FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. DAMAGE INC. has fired them because, although SAD BUT TRUE these guys have to ENTER SANDMAN once again to get out of this mess, and now WHEREVER I MAY ROAM I just hear their new crap, I guess Mtv believes that NOTHING ELSE MATTERS anymore. BLACKENED is the end, ONE...no wait five albums made them gods but now they've just became the HARVESTOR OF SORROW and have FADE TO BLACK....but THE MEMORY REMAINS of the old Metallica in many a fan. <br />   Was that a bit long? Sorry but I had to write a LONG list so I could kick the other peoples ass who does that. This album is bad so just dont buy it unless you're an orchestra loser.
B000059HAI|5.0|This movie is right up there with band of brothers, saving private ryan, apocalypse now, platoon in terms of great war movies.   <br /> <br />Tora really hits the nail on the head with the accurate portrayal of events leading up to the attack and really comes to a climax with the spectacular battle scene.  I could not believe some of the stunts in the film...the sequence on the airstrip were real live actors or stunt men but they came so close to being killed on film it was amazing.  There were planes exploding like 5 feet away from them and these guys were literally running for their lives...you actually have to pause and remember that this is a movie! <br /> <br />I loved the drama of the japanese actors..you can just sense the pride and mindset of the japanese warrior...I can watch tora over and over again and enjoy it just as much as the first time seeing it. <br /> <br />I find it ironic how japan entered the war only to force \\"negotiations\\" with the USA knowing full well they could not defeat the US military in a war.  Admiral yamamoto said he could raise havoc for one year against the americans but after that it was unknown.  Turned out he was absolutely correct in his prediction.  I don't think Japan could have won the war even if it destroyed the aircraft carriers at pearl harbor or won at midway.  Japan's objective was not to invade the USA but to control asia and all of its natural resources....Japan only attacked the USA to prevent them from interferring with their conquests in asia.  Japan miscalculated that the US could not reach japan in bombing attacks they never thought they could set up bases only 300 miles away from japan....japan's navy would have never allowed it so they assumed.    <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have been around a long time and heard a lot of great rock.  This album is an absolute masterpiece.  \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is brilliant.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I watched this as a 15 year old in 1983 and it scared the daylights out of me.  I was in HIgh School and all you ever worried about those days was world war III between soviet union and USA.  both countries had the finger on the trigger every minute of the day back then and we all were vulnerable to an end of the world apocalypse any day.  I remember there were several \\"close calls\\" where malfuntions or errors in the systems actually almost started nuclear attacks from both sides! <br /> <br />The part about this movie that stands out is when the father/farmer/husband comes back on horseback to find stragglers having a bbq on his front yard eating dead and radiated cattle not caring if its contaminated.  He pulls out his shotgun and asks what they are all doing there and the people look frightening...all men and a young boy or two.  ONe of the men sneaks up behind the farmer and shoots him right in the back!  We see a quick flash of his wife and daughter in kitchen suddenly turn to the gunshot sound and you wonder what happened to them later (at the mercy now of the men in the front yard?) - scary exclamation point that comes well after the mushroom clouds blow up.... <br /> <br />this movie will scare you like no other....the storyline of the sequence that leads to the war is also quite accurate and believable in terms of berlin being the flashpoint.   <br /> <br />I think the greatest movie of all time about nuclear war and its apocalypse is \\"TESTAMENT\\"....nothing can ever compare to that movie (still waiting for dVD though) but \\"the Day After\\" is anexcellent movie.   <br /> <br />
B00007K08H|4.0|It's most likely just personal taste, but I wasn't blown away by this movie as much as most of the other people here seem to be. It was a valiant attempt, sure, for a director who'd only made dark films before to try to film a light comedy. Somehow, it didn't quite click with me. I judge this film a good effort, but I think that it missed its potential too often. <br /> <br />I'll start with the first problem: The narrator. The narrator is present throughout the film, basically describing the story at every step; whenever a new character comes into the film, the narrator describes their \\"likes\\" and \\"dislikes\\". For me, this was especially distracting at the beginning of the film, when new characters came onto the screen so quickly that it was difficult to keep track of them all. Also, I may be alone, but I find the concept of judging a person by what they \\"like\\" and \\"dislike\\" to be a very shallow way of looking at them. <br />The narrator is the \\"easy way around\\", but I don't think he's the best; sometimes, I really wished that Jeunet would use him less and use other ways, such as images, sequences, or conversations to tell the story. <br /> <br />Another thing that bothered me was the film's attitude to love (don't read the next sentence if you're underage); that true love comes only through flirting and passionate sex. There is NEVER any conversation between the people in the film who are in love that would show that they love each other for something other than their bodies or their outward mannerisms; instead, it's all instinctive, impulsive, physical love. Really, I found it a bit silly, shallow and demeaning to the viewer. <br /> <br />Thirdly, almost all of the characters in this film, including Amelie, are so different from me or anybody I know that I simply can't relate with them at all (with a few exceptions like the \\"Glass Man\\" or his assistant). Most of them are well acted (like the man who played the \\"Glass Man\\"'s assistant, the immigrant artist/fruit-stand worker; brilliant), but I also find myself not finding them very interesting or realistic, and the ones that I DO find interesting are not the main characters... <br /> <br />Lastly, the story still feels too \\"fake\\", a leftover from the director's previous films. It was fine in \\"City of Lost Children\\" and \\"Delicatessen\\", where I suspended my disbelief somewhat because they obviously took place in alternate universes to ours. \\"Amelie\\", however, is too close to the \\"real world\\" for me to make those same kind of allowances. It often seemed too \\"glossy\\" a picture of the real world to me (I know that this is what Jeunet was going for, but that doesn't mean I have to like it). <br /> <br />Having now displayed all of the reasons why I DIDN'T like it, you may be wandering why I'm still giving it 4 stars. :) <br /> <br />Basically, because despite all of the flaws, it was brilliantly filmed, suceeded often enough to keep it interesting, and left me feeling relatively satisfied at the end. Most of you will probably love it; if the premise sounds like something that you would like, then go ahead and give it a try. Personally, I wasn't sure that it was quite my type of film, and I turned out to be correct in that regard. If I had to rate it, I'd give it somewhere between 75-79/100.

B00028HBKM|4.0|When I first heard that Mel Gibson was making a film of the passion story, and selected actor Jim Caviezel to play the role of Jesus, I thought this was a brilliant move.  Ever since I saw \\"Pay it Forward\\", I saw something of Christ in Caviezel and hoped he would actually get to play that role someday.  The other stroke of genius with \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" was using dialogue in the Aramaic and Latin languages, to lend a huge dose of realism to this film.  Finally, we get to hear the words of Christ and his disciples in the language they spoke! <br /> <br />This film has great, Oscar-worthy performances by Caviezel, by the woman who played his mother, and by the actor who played Pontius Pilate, and I hope they receive that recognition come Oscar time.  The visuals in the film were excellent and the film moved along, growing in intensity with each scene.  Gibson is a masterful storyteller and visual artist, and I also hope he receives a nod for Best Director by the Academy. <br /> <br />The downside of the film for me is the violence.  I do understand Gibson's intention was to show us the amount of suffering Christ endured for the sin of humanity and that it is our duty to endure the pain of watching such brutal violence he endured, but I thought it went on too long, with too much intensity.  The violence surpasses \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and was almost too much for me to handle.  I was pleased that Gibson offered brief respites of the violence with flashbacks from key scenes in Jesus' life...the most tear inducing for me being the little boy who fell and was comforted by his mother.  My favorite scene in the whole movie was seeing Jesus laughing as he talked to his mother about a table he was making.  I wished there were more of that...in fact, I would almost beg Gibson to make this film the middle in a trilogy...with the same actors, one covering \\"The Life of the Christ\\" and the other covering \\"The Resurrection of the Christ\\".  In fact, the film is so brief in the resurrection scene, that I felt awful leaving the theater.  There was no uplifting final scene to carry with you when you left the theater.  I guess the point was to make us feel awful and guilty and hopefully get movie goers to head straight to church to confess their sins and renew their commitment to Jesus once again. <br /> <br />Which brings me to my final point.  This film has been seen as the best evangelical missionary tool to come along in ages.  Many people seem to think that you could show a film like this to a non-Christian and they would be so guilt-ridden that they'd instantly convert to Christianity.  If only if it were that simple.  For me personally, a Christian all my life who leans towards Buddhism, I find the story of making Jesus out to be a sacrifice to appease an angry God to be simple, illogical, and insulting to anyone who believes in an all-knowing God.  Portraying Jesus as a mere sacrifice who endured suffering for the sake of humanity does have metaphorical implications, but such violence is more likely to turn off people who shun violence, like many Buddhists are.  But that's my only major complaint about the film.  It doesn't detract overall from the high quality standards of this film nor its importance.  It is worth owning on DVD and definitely will be my annual Good Friday tradition, so I can remind myself on that sorrowful day just what Jesus had to endure on his way towards divinity.
0316168815|5.0|The best novel I've ever read. Full of deep meaning and subtle change, I have read it over a dozen times and I always find something new an amazing. Heartbreakingly sad (I still Cry), often terrifying, filled with Susie's desperate longing to go to a place she can never be again. You have to read this book.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Well, I had heard all of the rumors that George Lucas was changing our beloved trilogy even MORE for the DVD release, so it was with some fear and trembling that I watched them for the first time.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Many of the changes undid or softened some of those from Special Edition that everyone hated.  Now in A New Hope for example, Han and Greedo pretty much shoot at the same time, and it looks much less awkward.  Jabba looks a whole lot more like Jabba, and they finally made Darth Vader's lightsaber red in those places where it once was white!  I think there are a couple of places in ROTJ where the score was changed for the 'Special Edition' and has now been changed back.  This is good for me because the new music was always a little disorienting, it wasn't supposed to be there.  The lightsaber duel of ANH looks 'worlds better' than any previous release.  In fact the visual quality in general is stunning!  The same goes for the other movies as well!  The snow battle on Hoth looked really nice, I think they added a great quantity of blaster fire being exchanged...  The visual quality alone I think was worth the price.  Watching it on wide screen helped me feel more 'in' the movie.  There were a couple of points in Ep.IV at which the sound was kind of funny, but that may have been a result of watching it on my laptop - I'm not sure.  Also the special features were nice, watching the old trailers was a bit nostalgic.  The menus on the DVDs and all of the art work is VERY well done, I must say.  On the whole, I feel like I got much more than my money's worth - the Force is definitely with this one!
B0002IQAN6|5.0|One of the best live albums of all time, I was hoping for more when they released this as a Hybrid 5.1 SACD.  1) Its now 2 cds again.  And you would think they would have 2 seperate holders for the cds.  They just piled them on top one another.  2) The surround sounds don't use the backs enough.  I think the quality of the recording hinders the effectiveness of surround sound.  I never feel like I am at the concert, unlike other surround sound discs.  Update:  I had a problem with the back speakers on my stereo.  Now, it sounds like the audience is behind you.  I now feel like I am at the concert.  It's amazing
B00003CXCT|5.0|The original Star Wars Trilogy is probably the most popular cinematic trilogy of all time.  With good reason, of course.  Luke and Leia Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader...these are all heroes and villans who have beem emulated since they first appeared on the screen.  But more important for our purposes now is to discuss the DVD.  First, the sound and picture quality are immensely superior to past versions on DVD.  The new digital transfer creates a picture and sound that is unsurpassed.  Star Wars has never looked or sounded this good, hands down.   <br />The extras are pretty good too.  The Empire of Dreams special was on television, but the version on the DVD is expanded.  It's the most comprehensive behind the scenes look at Star Wars out there.  The other featurettes are much shorter, but are still fun to watch.   <br />Yes, the rumors are true...Lucas did make additional changes beyond those made in the Special Edition released in 1997.  At the end of Jedi, Hayden Christiansen now appears as the ghost of Anakin Skywalker alongside Yoda and Obi-Want Kenobi.  Also, Clive Revill, the emperor from Empire Strikes Back, is replaced by Ian McDiarmid.  The conversation between him and Vader is slightly adjusted in order to tie in the prequels.  Many other changes are much more subtle...Temuera Morrison's (Jango Fett) voice is now heard for Bobba Fett and the Storm Troopers.  Digital effects are cleaned up in scenes for all three films.   <br />I know that many people objected to the changes that Lucas made the first time around and they are sure to do so again now.  Nevertheless, the trilogy is still three great films and anyone who considers themselves a fan of Star Wars must own this trilogy.  It hasthe definitive extras and version of the film.
B000007S5B|4.0|\\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" all things considered, represents the softer side of the doors.  Just come the difference in tone of both the music and the lyrics of \\"Light My Fire,\\" the first song most people remember hearing by the Doors, and \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" the hit single off of this third album.  For the most part \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" was something of a disappointment after the first two albums, but whereas \\"The Doors\\" hit #2 on the Billboard charts and \\"Strange Days\\" made it to #3, this one made it all the way to #1.  Go figure, boys and girls.  But in the end this might be a lesser album by the Doors but it still has its moments.<br /><br />The word that really describes the difference between this album and the rest of the Doors' oeuvre is, believe or not, \\"mellow.\\"  Listen to the rock ballads \\"Love Street,\\" \\"Wintertime Love,\\" \\"Summer's Almost Gone,\\" and \\"Yes the River Knows\\" and you will quickly get the point.  Jim Morrison's lyrics for \\"Love Street\\" are pretty autobiographical in terms of his budding romance with Pamela Courson and fans can still check out some of the locations alluded to in the song, which is a lot less expensive than going on a pilgrimage to Paris to see Morrison's grave.<br /><br />But while mellow might be a dominant element it is the eerie sounding song \\"The Unknown Solider,\\" with its anti-war lyrics, that is the standout piece on the album.  I am always amazed this song is only 3:10 long because it has so many parts that you think it goes on longer: Ray Manzarack provides a spooky organ intro (the man is one of my top three organ players of all-time in rock 'n' roll), the first verse has jazz elements, there is a firing squad in the middle, then the verse repeats in more of a rock style, and the song ends with the sounds of celebration.  This was not a prominent anti-war song, but it is hard to find one this literate or musically ambitious.<br /><br />\\"Hello, I Love You\\" was the hit single, but I always found it rather bland for a Doors song and at odds with pretty much everything else they did.  The explanation is that this song actually predates their self-titled debut album, so there is a reason it sounds so outdated and out of place (face it, this is a pop song).  I like Robby Krieger's flamenco guitar on \\"Spanish Caravan\\" and that song a lot more.  \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" is part of the legendary uncompleted work \\"The Celebration of the Lizard,\\" and the final track \\"Five to One,\\" driven by John Densmore's drumming, has some interesting lyrics attacking the flower children for failing to organize into a political power.  With the heavy guitar and organ playing this last song is decidedly not in the mellow mode.  The mix is a bit unsettling, but just proves the point that there is always something worth listening to on a Door's album.Doors song and at odds with pretty much everything else they did.

0783116934|5.0|\\"Citizen X\\" boasts a brilliant cast which includes Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Max Von Sydow and Jeffrey DeMunn.  It also offers viewers a compelling storyline about one of the most prolific serial killers in history and the man who finally brought him to justice.  We follow an honest, driven cop (Rea) as he negotiates his way through the labyrinth of denial and bureaucratic stonewalling in the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />Sutherland as an army Colonel who is at first just in it as a part of a grand political scheme, is affecting as a man who comes to understand the importance of Rea's work on a wholly human level.  Von Sydow is wonderful (as always) as a psychiatrist who is willing to go against prevailing attitudes in his own field for the chance not only to help catch the killer, but to study him.  And DeMunn is nothing short of amazing as the killer who provokes revulsion, anger and pity by turns.<br /><br />This is a film which cannot leave you untouched.  But be warned, it's a hard film to watch.  It doesn't shrink from the details of the crimes or the harsh realities of life at the end of the Soviet Union.
067144901X|5.0|This is our third Boynton book and both baby and mommy love it! <br /> <br />This is a darling book about the sounds animals make. All of them correct except the dancing, singing pigs that say \\"La, la, la\\". \\"No, no you say that isnt right a pig say's Oink all day and night!\\" Its just too cute! Among the other animals that are talking are big and little dogs, cats and horses.  <br /> <br />At this point my 8 1/2 month old just loves the pictures and the different animal sounds I make. I can see that as she gets older, she will want to make the sounds with me. And the point in the book about the pigs will be very funny. <br /> <br />This is a fun, interactive book your child will love. And worth the price. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEU|4.0|I live in Odessa, TX... <br /> <br />I drive by Permian High School at least twice every single day and I must tell you how wierd it was to see the camera driving down 42nd street in front of the school just like I do everyday. <br /> <br />This movie did make my town look quite small, but I do think that it brought the reality of how we treat football in this town. I am not a Permian fan by no means...Odessa High School Bronchos fan here...but this movie made me think that I feel the same way about the Bronchos winning that these people felt about the Panthers. Although neither one of the teams have been involved in any sort of playoffs or state championships lately, the seats of Ratliff Stadium are still full every Friday night for the game. Businesses don't shut their doors just for the game anymore like they did in 1988...but that doesn't mean that Odessa football isn't celebrated by just about everyone... <br /> <br />This movie is not your typical football movie like \\"Varsity Blues\\" or \\"Remember the Titans\\" where the players are playing for the fun of the game and every game is won...this movie highlights the reality of football taken to the extreme in a small town where hopes of the championship coming back to Odessa are real and they mean everything to these people...this movie portrays what the players actually go through to live up to the expectations of the whole town, their school, coaches, and their parents. The pressures for these young boys are real.  <br /> <br />I think Billy Bob did a really good job in this movie and the young guys were awesome. They brought Odessa and Ratliff Stadium to the big screen! In a town like Odessa, that is HUGE! <br /> <br />I loved this movie for the fact that is was very honest and brought out the truth about a game that is loved and taken so seriously by millions.  <br /> <br />If you wanna know the truth...watch this movie
B0002OERI0|4.0|This is a great CD.  I also purchased Silvertide's Show and Tell and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it too.  Its not punk rock, but its the best hard rock since Guns n Roses.  Get both CD\\"S, you'll love them.
B0002S947K|5.0|I haven't felt compelled to write an opinion here in the past, but sboyer's comment about Patty Griffin was so uncannily like my own first thoughts I just had to mention it.  Patty Griffin penned perhaps the most important folk album of a decade in \\"Living With Ghosts\\"... and it would be hard for me to consider \\"Trouble\\" any less remarkable.  Even better?  It might be, it might. <br /> <br />It's impossible not to recognize an artistic giant in Ray Lamontagne.  So few people display a mastery of craft these days, and even fewer of those actually have something to say.  Ray clearly posesses both - the music just reaches through the ribs and grips the beating heart.  Superb work - and one of the only albums I would feel comfortable recommending to anyone, regardless of their taste.

0671449028|5.0|I only had one other Boynton book \\"Snuggle Puppy\\" which my daughter loves so I wanted to get her another Boynton book. \\"The Going to Bed\\" book is  a hit! <br /> <br />This book is about several different animals in different shapes and sizes getting ready for bed on a boat. They brush their teeth, excersize and put on pajamas. <br /> <br />The illustrations are cute and her rythmic poetry is perfectly easy to read. <br /> <br />My daughter absolutely loves the pictures and she must like the sound of the words because she gets so excited by this book. <br /> <br />I personally like this book for reading at bedtime because of its length. Its short, sweet and to the point. And the very last page of the book \\"They rock and rock and rock to sleep\\" is perfect when read slowly to emphasize the end of the day. <br /> <br />Her books are precious and very inexpensive. This is not a book you will be donating or selling at a garage sale. Your baby/child will love it!
