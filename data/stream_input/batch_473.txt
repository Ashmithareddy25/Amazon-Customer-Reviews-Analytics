B00064MW6A|3.0|Catwoman is a non-stop fun ride! Halle Berry is a purr-fect for the role of Catwoman! This is one of her best roles yet! Sharon Stone also stars as well, and is quite enjoyable. The film is quite funny as well. However, this film does have one cliche. The special effects in the film seem a bit fake. But overall this movie is enjoyable.    Pros: Funny, Sexy, Enjoyable Cast, Watchable    Cons: Special Effects Seem A Bit Fake.    Overall: *** stars
0553278223|5.0|This is the fictional history of the discovery of life on Mars and its subsequent settling by humans. Every chapter is a different short story (sort of like The Illustrated Man, though IMHO better).  <br />Ray Bradbury is definitely one of the most influential and prolific American writers ever. In a recent article Chuck Palahniuk listed this book as the one that inspired him the most as a young adult, always keeping a battered copy with him. I Love Palahniuk's work, so this is a big complement to Bradbury. As one \\"So you would like to...\\" list states- your grandkids will probably be studying this as a classic in the future, so check it out and find your Sci-Fi roots.
B0001AP12G|5.0|The College Dropout is without a doubt one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time.  A classic.  So many memorable tracks, everyone is unique and very well written/produced.  Kanye takes it to another level.  He can be real, make listenable music, not like 50 cent or other \\"mainstream\\" rappers.  He reminds me of a young Nas, who I consider to be the second greatest rapper of all time behind Tupac.  Im not saying Kanye is the next Nas or Tupac but his future is so promising I might have to he is one day.    Best songs    1-Family buisness  2-Jesus Walks  3-Through the Wire  4-Never Let You Doen  5-Spaceship  6-Get em high
B0001BKAEY|5.0|I think the key, as is the case with most movies touted as ground breaking, to enjoy this film, is to have no pre-conceptions. It does seem that the hard core  fans have a really overly self conscious view of what the MATRIX  material is supposed to be ( hence the Multipack of all films with over 30 hours of extras), so I just took to the DVD as something I wanted to see, since the second film was fun but had no resolution, and I watched, enjoyed the sound on a 5.1  system, and took the dialogue as part of a pretentious film: at the end of the film, I found that I had enjoyed myself  immensely. <br />The Railway station scene is a legitimate point of contention, but I found it to be very similar to the idea behind the film THE 13th  FLOOR, where realities  were not what they seemed. <br /> <br />The fight scenes were just great:  overblown in places, heroic in places, but just a total fun set piece. <br />I had read so much trash about the film, and the previous ones, that it seemed like it was going to be set up more like some sort of pseudo-Buddhist sermon of the nature of existence. Well, I fail to see how it works as that sort of piece; if you really want to learn what some enlightened  souls teach about that, then learn Sanskrit, and read some quite good poetic works in the Buddhist  canons. <br /> <br />These films are a blast as fun, escapist material, but as anything beyond that they are not quite there, and if you expect that, then I think you will be more than a little disappointed. But , as fun films, they Deliver, and Keanu works his cinematic  magic  again, and I suspect he will with CONSTANTINE this upcoming weekend. <br /> <br />This is entertainment  people, not the sabbath  sermonette; Good fun film, I hope you enjot it as much as I did.
B0000CFW87|1.0|2/20/05 - The reviewer who compared this wretched screechmonger to Maestro Pavarotti is either completely deaf or mentally unhinged to the point of no return.  B. Rall is a man who has his priorities straight.  He is obviously a scholar and a gentleman and I applaud him for a scathing review of the one who deceives the masses by his filthy perversion of artistic phonation. DOWN WITH THE MUCICAL BLASPHEMER!      Here is the Grade Josh Groban Receives for his effort:    Category 1: Diction    French   - Terrible  Italian  - Has he ever actually heard an Italian Speak (or sing)  English  - He speaks it, and it is still abhorrent  Spanish  - I think you get the picture    Final Grade: F    Category 2: Vocal Production     - It is great for someone who:  A) wants to sing like a wimp  B) wants to sing poorly  C) wants to have a voice which is totally thin and uninteresting     - He has absolutely zero core to his sound, making his voice sound as if it were one long exhale with just a hint of pitch.    Final Grade: F    Category 3: Musicality    His music and singing are both completely devoid of any genuine emotion and/or artistic intention. He employs all of the commonplace \\"tricks of the trade\\" in pop music to make people melt. To be honest though, Art is a two way process between the artist and the listener, and if someone is melting over this garbage, than they are most likely just as emotionally and artistically vapid as Mr. Groban.    Final Grade: F    GPA: 0    Hint to all of you who listen to and like Mr. Groban; buy a cd of a real baritone like Bryn Terfel, or Dmitri Hvorostovsky.  You will ultimately get much more from the experience, and realize how unworthy Mr. Groban is of your praise, and how incredibly commonplace a voice like his is.    He is not a classical singer, he is not an opera singer, he is not a good singer. People who can rightfully claim these titles work for years to train their voices to a degree of perfection that Mr. Groban will never comprehend.    PLEASE, GIVE MUSIC A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT.  REACH OUT AND REALIZE THAT THERE IS A WHOLE WORLD OF MUSIC OUT THERE WHICH SURPASSES THIS BY GREAT LENGTHS. LISTEN TO IT, AND REALIZE WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE ART THROUGH MUSIC.
B000002KIE|5.0|Okay, so I saw the past two reviews about low ratings on this album, and decided to see what they were talking about.  I now have somthing say. <br />1. To be an anarchist is to oppose all forms of higher power.  By all means they can gather.  Anarchy does not mean no talking to anyone, or sharing idea's.  Some kid's just do not know what they are talking about.  But I forgive them, they are too young. <br />2.Some person with horrible typing skills mocked punks.  Well, at least they can spell, which shows how messed up rap kids are.  Punk and punks is a far more deep and meaningful topic then the way you dress.  It is a whole lifestyle, and I suggest you learn about it before you mock it.  You know nothing, and I thank you for proving that.   <br />3. This cd is awsome and is a classic.  True, any kid who wants to act punk needs only to wear a shirt sporting \\"the Clash\\" or \\"The Sex Pistols\\", but true punks listen to it, or have.  It changed music so much.  But looking at \\"The Sex Pistols\\" and \\"Reagen Youth\\" you realize punks have to suffer.  But teh day we forget punk, will be the day we forget music history and music becomes even more pathetic then rap, emo, pop punk (which is a slap in the face to true punk), or any other brand of music that is played on MTV.
B00006G8G1|5.0|Very long time Maiden fan posting.  Like a lot of the reviewers here, I lost interest in Maiden after the Live after Death/Somewhere in Time period.  Honestly, it was more of my life/priorities changing, than Maidens music.  Does this DVD ever prove that point.  I'm still shocked/stoked at how GREAT this DVD is !  I can't figure out what took me so long to pick it up.  Maybe it was the low expectations I had regarding song titles I wasn't familiar with ... or the reviews regarding the camera angles/changes.  Whatever it was disappeared the second Adrian hits the first chords of Wicker Man ... actually the build up to that point gives you goosebumps.  There ARE a TON of camera changes, and yeah as a guitarist, I would have liked to have seen a little more solo sections shown longer up close ... but Harris didn't totally blow it with the rapid changes ( he really should have toned it a bit down though ).  The changes keep you as a viewer constantly absorbed in each song.  Seeing, and most importantly capturing the energy of all the band members at any given time is damn hard to display over a tv screen.  Even seeing them live with the whole spectacle you miss a lot ... ESPECIALLY with a stage that big.  I never thought I'd see a Maiden production to rival Live after Death, and although the stage set up was better in 85, this production with all the camera angles exceeds it for the viewer.  I saw Maiden up close in 85 at Long Beach Arena when they filmed and recorded Live after Death.  I also saw them sitting further back for the Somewhere in Time tour at Irvine Meadows.  Up close, you have a limited view ... turn your head to see one thing, and you miss a couple others.  Far back, you see the stage/light show better, but a bunch of ants running around the stage.  I think Harris realized this too ... it's spooky how well this dvd conveys the energy a Maiden show produces.  Remember, theres 6 guys to cover ( actually Janick Gers moves so much he should count for two ),PLUS the 250,000 fans going beserk singing and clapping along the ENTIRE time.  THOSE are fans !  The real treat for me was hearing newer Maiden material and feeling as if I just discovered some lost classic album.  Although I would have loved to have seen more \\"jurassic\\" classics like Phantom of the Opera or Killers performed, I tell you what ... Sign of the Cross and Clansman just rip your head off.  I'd never heard those songs before, and they came across as instant classics.  I didn't intend to be long winded here, but it seems the excitement Maiden conveys in their shows is contageous ... even after all these years.  Buy this DVD, and if you don't like it, I'll buy it from you since I know Im going to wear out my current one.  Watching this takes me back to Long Beach Arena in 85 ... Scream for me Brazil !    p.s.  the 2nd DVD is pretty cool in showing the various band members doing what they love to do on days off.  The Janick Gers segment is especially well done.  I knew nothing of the man, since I basically stopped following Maiden once he joined ... his attitude and positive views on life and Maiden show why they are even stronger today than they ever were
B000001E2W|4.0|I remember when I first got my copy of this disc, as I just assumed the label wanted to simply ca$h in on the Anthrax days long gone. This twelve track offering is rather decent, specially if you ever got to see the band when former vocalist Joey Belladonna was fronting them. Notable cuts include the opener \\"NFL\\" (remember what that stands for?), \\"Parasite\\", (still like seeing the video on VH1 Classic), their signature song \\"Indians\\", \\"I Am The Law\\", \\"Caught In A Mosh\\" and \\"Anti-Social\\". Opposed to all the long time Anthrax fans that (often) debate they like John Bush as their vocalist, I like Belladonna better. A good thrash metal catalog title. Great cover.
B00004TR2G|1.0|I'm sorry, but how can you possibly have a soundtrack that omits the best musical moment of the whole movie? <br /> <br />I am, of course, referring to Robert Shaw's (Captain Quint) classic rendition of an old sailor diddy...which he so memorably serenaded Mister Hooper with after inquiring about Hooper's Anit-Shark Cage!.... <br /> <br />\\"farewell and aduei(sic?) to my fair Spanish ladies <br />farewell and aduei to my ladies of Spain. <br />For we've received orders, we're to sail back to Boston. <br />And so, never more, shall we see you again.\\"
B0006213WG|4.0|A good album. Very good. Not great, but good. I was suprised by Sum 41 these past couple of years. When \\"All Killer, No Filler\\" hit the shelves, and MTV, and the radio, and pop punk history, I hated this group. Another pop-punk, post Blink 182-getting-big band. I think we were all fooled. Sum 41 released that pop CD to get big. I think they made it to get noticed so when they released \\"Does This Look Infected\\", they could put out their real political views and have kids listen. A very good idea. I think more punk rock bands should do this. Make some catchy, p*ssy pop CD, then when all the kids are paying attention, hit them with the cold hard fact that the government is sh*t, the war is sh*t, Bush is sh*t, and everything you know is false, fabricated, and polished with a coat of protective teflon so that nothing can phase our sedated, I-Don't-Care-ikan minds. Gotta love them. This album is another attempt at telling the truth to young Americans from another country's (Canada) point of view. A good album with some excellent catchy songs. Sum 41 has redeemed themself over the years in my opinion and I now consider them \\"punk\\". I forgive you for \\"All Killer, No Filler\\", Sum 41, just don't do it again...
B0006U4UAU|5.0|It's fascinating: I can't remember the last album to be released that was so inexorably tied to indie-hipsterism and its fickle, ever-changing sense of what's \\"in.\\" LCD Sound System are so cool that there's a critical/hipster backlash against them before they even released this, their first album. That they include a bonus disk of the early singles that got them where they are today is impressive -- it says that they are willing to let the new material stand beside the more acclaimed older stuff.  <br /> <br />Cries of \\"derivative\\" are already being levied at LCDSS, and it's true that their taut, rhythmic pop owes a lot to their record collection: Can, Fall, Faust, Eno, Wire, etc. But why not steal from the best? The beats here are minimal, but incredibly nuanced in a way that LCDSS's forefathers never were, and above everything else, this is FUN music. Franz Ferdinand and Interpol are fine at the gloomy herky-jerky thing, but I don't think I'd ever put them on to facilitate having a good time...this is another story! <br /> <br />Not since the first Strokes' record has there been an album so fun and memorable that's been embraced by the smug, self-satisfied Pitchforkmedia generation. And not since the second Strokes album are you likely to see an absolutely unwarrented backlash against them. <br /> <br />But put aside this petty anthropology. Throw on the first disk and rejoice in the spell-binding beats, the amusingly self-efacing vocals, and the starkly propulsive vibe that surges the whole thing forward.
0385510454|1.0|I found this to be one of the slowest, most boring books he's ever written.  It was all I could do to get through it.  It was very tiresome being forced to learn Italian along with the character.  I found no intrigue, no suspense until the very end. I miss story types like \\"The Firm\\" and \\"Pelican Brief\\".  This was you last chance John; I'm not wasting my money again.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|If you hope to-be taken-back to those \\"Good old days\\" at either 17, 35 or even 75, this CD Does that for 22 Times of listening! Each time I've heard it, I added new thots! It seems that it was such a great treat for him to choose these performers, he lifted their sights and ability to perform close to his earlier days! As an inquisitive younger Lover of great Jazz, even a Bit of Country, Blues, Gospel- I was totally floored!    Not much agreement with: L. Quido, Howe/Darien, Shas/Trip or other reviews I was awesomely surprised in hearing his great Joy so near-to death/The Ray Charles singing with Variety of Genius! No doubt, He was All-time Favorite in areas of Gospel, Country, Yes, Blues + Jazz! Looking back into my deep Love of Music from Churches, Schools, Seminaries, the Movie, \\"Ray\\"... Then hearing this Awesome CD of Ray beside my favorite singers, I'm moved to  Joy & Tears!     My best evaluation as noted in one Review: \\"What a way to die\\" then go out-into the Other-World: Than greet those Families-on-the Other-Side: the KING Family (BB or MLK,Jr); the COLE Family; Nelsons; Raitt's; Kralls; Knights...Especially My own Family of Hood's of \\"You are my Sunshine\\" From County Church, Traditional, Great Jazz! I believe he made each performer try to be great: B.B. Kimg, Bonnie Raitt, Natalie Cole, And even Johnny Mathis!      My Order: 1st Willie Nelson, 2, Natalie Cole, 3, Johnny Mathis, 4, Bonnie Raitt, 5, Gladys Knight--Counry on to Blues, to Pop, finally Great Jazz! Accolades from Retired Chaplain Fred W Hood
B00005AQE8|1.0|2pac is a a terrible rapper who pretends to be gangster.  If you want to listen to a real thug with good music listen to will smith.
B000669GAI|5.0|I love Pearl Jam and have always wanted to have all their fast songs on one CD and all their softer songs on another CD. I now have that with this 2 CD set. The first CD is great for exercising/shadow boxing etc. The second CD is great for getting over a lost(or never had) loved one or just relaxing. I recommend this to anyone in the above situations or just a Pearl Jam fan.
630310696X|5.0|Tom Hanks stars in this provocative drama about a lawyer who is dismissed from his high-profile law firm under suspicious circumstances.  Hanks stars as Andrew Beckett, a highly successful lawyer in a prominent Philadelphia law firm headed by Charles Wheeler (Jason Robards).  Andrew is given a very lucrative account to handle, but his paperwork for the case mysteriously disappears moments before the case is to begin, and to make matters worse, the Statute of Limitations is about to run out.  Fortunately, the paperwork is found in time, but Andrew, as a result of this mishap,  ends up falling out of favor with his senior partners, but is there more than meets the eye? <br /> <br />Andrew is dismissed by his firm for nearly fouling up the case, but Andrew beleives that there are other reasons for his firing, so he decides to fight his dismissal in court.  He seeks the help of attorney Joe Miller, played magnificently by Denzel Washington.  Unknown to the conservative Miller, Andrew is infected with the AIDS virus.  Andrew believes that this is the real reason that he was fired, not the botched legal case.  However, Miller is very reluctant to help Andrew.  Miller fits the classic \\"homophobic\\" stereotype; all homosexuals are \\"bad\\", they should be locked up, etc.  Undeterred, Andrew decides to fight his case on his own. <br /> <br />One night while studying at a local law library, Andrew and Joe meet up once again.  The two begin to talk, and Joe begins to ask questions about Andrew's case.  After much consideration, Joe decides to represent Andrew, and, as the movie goes along, a very strong friendship develops between the two.  Despite their friendship, will Joe be able to help Andrew win his lawsuit, or will the large firm and their high profile and high-priced lawyers win in the end? <br /> <br />This is an excellent movie.  I'm a big Tom Hanks fan, and I've seen many of his other films (\\"Saving Private Ryan, \\"Apollo 13\\", etc), but he gives his best dramatic performance in \\"Philadelphia\\".  Watching the way that the AIDS virus progresses during the course of the movie is very dramatic and very effective.  The scene where Andrew raises his shirt in the courtroom to expose the leisions on his chest is especially dramatic.  The medical aspects of the disease are handled well throughout the film.  Andrew's fall in the courtroom is extremely gripping to see. <br /> <br />Denzel Washington's character of Joe Miller deserves as much praise as Hanks' charater of Andrew.  Washington does an excellent job of playing a homophobic person confronted with the responsibility of defending a homosexual.  It's enlightening to watch Joe's transformation from homophobe in the beginning of the film to trusted friend and colleague at the end.  His courtroom scenes and examination of witnesses are high points of the movie. <br /> <br />The supporting actors (Jason Robards as Charles Wheeler and Antonio Banderas as Miguel) give powerful performances as well.  I especially liked Robards.  He did a fantastic job of portraying the prototypical \\"tough and by the book\\" lawyer.  In the end, however, it was his close-mindedness that was his downfall. <br /> <br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The acting and story is first-rate and the message is very powerful; friendship and belief in what you are doing can overcome any obstacle.
B0002YLC24|4.0|First of all i'm not going to mention any things of the plot in order not to spoil the movie.I'm just going to write what i didn't like in this movie. <br /> <br />When i first saw the \\"before the sunrise\\" in 1996, i was 16 years old.This first movie holds a great bunch of dreams of me.I've found myself in the role of Ethan Hawke,as it was my favorite dream,to travel all over Europe,all by myself.This movie carried this dream of me until today as well (you guessed it right-it just didn't come true,yet:). <br /> <br />Anyways, believe it or not,i've saw the movie after having the dvd at home 2 days,cause i felt i should get myself emotinaly ready for it. <br /> <br />There are many things in the new sequel that realy wasn't as i expected,or hoped. <br /> <br />First of all it starts real fast;within ten minuted you can listen to them talking about several things like the first movie.I expected more electrism,more feeling and perhaps more enthusiasm when they finaly meet after 9 years. <br /> <br />Second,i didn't like the acting style,especialy Hawke's.In the first one all the things were more natural,more sincere,more innocent.I realy couldn't find any of the naturalism i loved in the first one. <br /> <br />Third, most of the dialogues are mediocre.I was a realy surprised to see that Hawke and Delpy took part in the screen writing. <br /> <br />Ok i'm now going to mention a couple of parts in the movie,so those who haven't saw it,better finish here reading. <br /> <br />When Delpy played the song \\"a waltz for a night\\", i expected Hawke to be touched or distressed or at least to say something sweet and honest.But instead,he says \\"C'mon play another one\\".Jesus,that part was realy awful!!  <br /> <br />Another spoiler was the fact that the whole movie took place in just 6 or 7 places.You wont find much of the beautiful scenery you loved in the first one.Paris is one of the most wonderful cities in Europe and i expected to see some great places as well,as the first one.But i didn't. <br /> <br />Overal,the movie isn't that bad.It's a very touching and romantic movie and i would recommend it to anyone.But i expected this sequel to be more honest,more innocent-after all, love is innocent and honest itself.The movie starts bad indeed,it gets some kind of boring till the middle,but after that it gets great.Especialy the Deply's last song,brought me back feelings of the first movie that i haven't felt for years. <br /> <br />Give it a try and i think you wont be disapointed.But personaly speaking, i will leave myself in the first one.That one creates dreams and strong feelings.This one,it just isn't that much.
B000002N2P|5.0|I own every single Green day album, and this is probably the best one they have done. If you are expecting this to be something like \\"American idiot\\", then think again. Musically, this is nothing like \\"American idiot\\", the music on this album is a lot more heavier, punkier and snottier and the lyrics are just crazy.  <br />The songs are: <br /> <br />1. Armatage shanks: Just a catchy punk song really. One of the best on the album, but nothing much else to say. 10/10 <br />2. Brat: Not great.  A bit fast and short, but not too bad I suppose. From the lyrics it seems to be about wanted your mom and dad dead so you can get all your inheritance. 6/10 <br />3. Stuck with me: Not only is this the best song on the album, it's one of my favourite Green day songs ever. I don't know why, cause it's just a simple 3-finger chord punk song, but it's just so damn catchy and fun. It has a good bass solo too. 10/10 <br />4. Geek stink breath: A bit more heavier than the other songs. The lyrics are a bit more disdurbing, and the song is somewhat slower-paced. 9/10 <br />5. No pride: Catchy and fun, but just not a favourite. 7/10 <br />6. Bab's uvula who?: Billie Joe sings so goddamn fast on this. Not a great song, but if you want a headache, listen to this. 8/10 <br />7. 86: A good song, many seem to overlook. Heavy again, but a lot like something from \\"Dookie\\". 10/10 <br />8. Panic song: Good song. The 2-minute build-up gets a tiny bit boring after a while, but once the singing co9mnes in it's just a great, fast catchy song. Best guitar work on this song out of the whole album. 10/10 <br />9. Stuart and the ave.: Good bass again, but this song is just too short and after a while iot becomes more repetative. A bit more upbeat and lighter songs on the album. 8/10 <br />10. Brain stew: Slow, spooky song. Kinda downbeat, but it somehow gets me hooked. If you can't sleep you could probably relate to this song. 10/10 <br />11. Jaded: Very short song, that gets more moving about again after the slow \\"Brain stew\\". <br />12. Westbound sign: Another overlooked song. Upbeat and catchy again. 10/10 <br />13. Tight wad hill: Simlar to \\"Westbound sign\\" but it's just not that good enough really. 7/10 <br />14. Walking contracdiction: Catchy song again, but the guitar riffs are a bit too repetative. A good song at first, but gets boring soon after. 8/10 <br /> <br />This album is simlar to \\"Dookie\\" but it just seems a lot heavier, darker. The problem is that all the songs are very similar, there are no solos are anythign like that in the songs, and it times it takes a while to remember how some of the songs go. Still, once you've given this album a few listens you'll love it.
B000000IV0|5.0|Opinions may differ, but one thing is for sure, Nirvana forever changed the lives of many people and Kurt was the most talented song writer of my generation! Who else could sing about \\"Had to eat my dinner there, mashed potatoes and stuff like that, couldn't chew my meat so good\\"....and get away with it! I mean c-mon, the man was brillant and unfortunately his life was ended way to soon! There will NEVER be another ~KURT COBAIN~ or ~NIRVANA~!!! Rock on Kurt!!!
B000002OX7|5.0|The Who were part of the Holy Trinity of British rock (if you need to ask who the other two were, move on) and this album makes it clear why.  Tommy may have made The Who superstars, but Who's Next made them legends.  This is really tough hard rock and it packs a heck of a wallop.  The lyrics are often angry and the singing and playing back up that anger completely.  If rock had continued to be this good into the mid 70s, punk need not have existed. <br /> <br />It's difficult to select favorites because the quality of the songs is so consistently excellent throughout (although John Entwistle's singing on My Wife just doesn't measure up to Daltrey's).  But I have to give the nod to \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" which sounds like a miniature hard rock symphony.  After almost nine minutes it leaves you begging for more.  (So many rock songs released now are five minutes or more but I'm bored before the first minute is up).  <br /> <br />If you want to know why John Entwistle and Keith Moon are considered by many to be the best bassist and drummer respectively in rock history, look no further.  These guys were not a rhythm section, they played their instruments like lead instruments and the overall impact was tremendous.   <br /> <br />As we know from the post grunge era, loudness and ability to play your instruments doesn't alone add up to great music.  You have to have great songs and there's nothing but on Who's Next. A couple of excellent ballads (\\"Song Is Over\\" and \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\") are well placed to give the album some sonic diversity, although even these build up.  But, in spite of the loudness of the music, I can hum or whistle any one of the melodies just by recalling the song title.  This album is inarguably a towering landmark in the history of recorded rock and roll. <br /> <br />(The seven extra tracks on this re-release are generally quite good, although not up to par with the original material.  For anyone just getting into The Who, I'd strongly recommendjust playing the first nine tracks which were on the original release, at least for the first few listens.  That will help you understand why this is still one of the most cherished rock albums ever, 34 years after its release).
0393039765|4.0|Yeah, yeah, the book is great, but this hardcover edition sucks... if I'm spendind 13 extra bucks on a hardcover edition  <br />I'd expect it was good quality paper and finish.

B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|Last fall Marillion came to Cleveland.  I was a big Fish fan but I had never seen Marillion live, and I figured I could sit through most of Steve Hogarth's singing (not that it is offensive, but the lyrics can be a little trite--these chains?!!!) just to witness the brilliance of Steve Rothery's guitar playing.  I even talked three of my buddies into going to the show, none of which had listened to ANY Marillion since Misplaced Childhood.  It won't be that bad, I told them.  They were skeptical, to say the least. <br /> <br />Fifteen minutes into the show, Marillion is putting the final touches on the Invisible Man, the opening track to Marbles.  I am grinning from ear to ear, and my buddies are giving me high-fives of approval. <br /> <br />On CD, Marillion was maddening in its inconsistency in the 90's, so I stopped following their latest releases after .com.  An hour into the show, I hadn't heard any music I was familiar with, but that didn't diminish my satisfaction.  I just assumed that I was hearing the best of the latest releases.  I no sooner had a stranger next to me tell me that I was hearing tracks from the new release called Marbles (hmmm, maybe I should consider getting that one, I thought), when Steve Hogarth tip-toed into Neverland.  Just listen to THIS, the stranger said. <br /> <br />Suffice to say, Neverland was the icing on the cake.  Less than 24 hours later, my buddies and I each owned a new copy of Marbles.  This is a very good CD, if nothing else, on the strength of Invisible Man and Neverland.  These songs are to the Marbles CD what Season's End and Easter are to the Season's End CD.  Without these four songs, you have two CD's that are pleasant enough to listen to, but not epic.  I didn't know until recently there was a 2-CD release of Marbles, so I haven't heard to 18-minute masterpiece that everyone is buzzing about.  Even so, it would not have been a stretch to give Marbles a 5-star rating had I not seen it performed live first.  The studio recording does not match the intensity of the live performance. <br /> <br />For what it's worth, I also bought Fish's concert DVD's Fool's Company, Parts 1 and 2, the same day I bought Marbles.  That was a waste of money.  For all Fish's theatrics on CD, he just doesn't have the vocal range or the stage dynamics of Steve Hogarth, and I have since adopted a new 'favorite' Marillion frontman. <br /> <br />
B000000IV0|5.0|Opinions may differ, but one thing is for sure, Nirvana forever changed the lives of many people and Kurt was the most talented song writer of my generation! Who else could sing about \\"Had to eat my dinner there, mashed potatoes and stuff like that, couldn't chew my meat so good\\"....and get away with it! I mean c-mon, the man was brillant and unfortunately his life was ended way to soon! There will NEVER be another ~KURT COBAIN~ or ~NIRVANA~!!! Rock on Kurt!!!

B000065V3H|5.0|This film has to be one of the most underrated films of the 80s.  It's such a classic...I mean what's better than boy meets girl,boy pays girl,boy loses girl and then gets her back?

B00014K5TQ|3.0|Macaully Culking never comes close to the real Micahel Alig.  The real Micahel Alig was creepy and hollow.  That aside, this movie tries to capture the color and mayhem of the Club Kid Era.  (For those that were around then, well, nothing will ever come close.) Seth Green steals the movie as James St. James, Aligs foil and confidant.  The movie leads up to the murder of Micahel Melendez, aka Angel, a drug dealer to the \\"A-List\\" in Club Land.  His gruesome murder is glossed over with the bare details.  Alig is made a little bit more \\"straighter\\" in this film by giving him a sexaul relationship with a girl.  As if.  Based on teh book, Disco Bloodbath.  Marilyn Manson makes an appearance as the the transgendered Christina, who was a scarier queen than Marilyn could ever be.
B0000C23DO|4.0|It's hard to argue with this compilation for what it is (though I will!) -- one disc of pop-oriented songs by the Dead.  Rhino has expanded the old Warners \\"grateful dead's greatest hits\\" (ie, \\"Skeletons From the Closet\\") with tracks from Grateful Dead Records and Arista releases.<br /><br /> But here are some problems, from the point of view of someone who has been a serious listener since the early '70s:<br /><br /> 1) There is nothing here from 1968/1969, arguably the band's peak years.  If a live \\"One More Saturday Night\\" can be included (from EUROPE '72), why not the live \\"St. Stephen\\" from LIVE/DEAD?  \\"Mountains of the Moon\\" from AOXOMOXOA would be a  good representation of that period too.<br /><br /> 2) There are several choice cuts from WORKINGMAN'S DEAD and AMERICAN BEAUTY, the band's two best studio albums, both from 1970, and I have only one minor suggestion -- \\"Ripple\\" sounds strange without segueing into \\"Brokedown Palace.\\"<br /><br /> 3) \\"Eyes of the World\\" is without a doubt the high point of WAKE OF THE FLOOD ('73), but when it comes to MARS HOTEL ('74), where is \\"Scarlet Begonias\\"?  This is a serious oversight given that it is one of the catchiest most radio-friendly songs the Dead ever came up with.  I would make room for \\"Ship of Fools\\" too, another great Garcia/Hunter composition.<br /><br /> 4) I've added 5 songs, so let's try to keep the record execs and the single-disc-buying public happy.  \\"The Music Never Stopped\\" from BLUES FOR ALLAH is dispensable.  And I know it's not realistic, given that we're talking about the Dead's biggest radio hit, but I would toss both songs from IN THE DARK (\\"Touch of Grey\\" and \\"Hell in a Bucket\\").  I don't expect Rhino to take my advice, needless to say.  Well, that's only 3.  I'm not sure \\"Golden Road\\" is the best choice from the first Warners album (what about \\"Morning Dew\\"?), so maybe it could be tossed as well, and still fit the rest on that Single Disc For An Unbeatable Low Price.<br /><br /> If you're just starting in on the Dead, you may or may not know that serious fans consider LIVE to be best.  The band excels at unpredictable improvisation, impossible to capture in the studio or in a 3-minute pop song.  So if you decide to turn to the sprawling galaxy of live recordings now available (including the extensive Dick's Picks series of \\"official bootlegs\\"), I would say the place to start is with the 3 first official live recordings on Warners -- LIVE/DEAD (1969), GRATEFUL DEAD (SKULL & ROSES -- 1971) and EUROPE '72 (1972).t starting in on the Dead, you may or may not know that serious fans consider LIVE to be best.

B00003CX5P|4.0|My feeling about what detracts from episode I when compared with episodes IV-VI is that there isn't a central character that we can identify with fully enough.  In episode IV-VI, we have a pivotal moment at the end of each movie: Luke has faith in the Force and destroys Death Star, Luke discovers Vader is his father, Luke defeats the Emperor by refusing to give into the dark side when he had the advantage over his father.  In episode I we have a pivotal moment in the battle between Obi Wan and Darth Maul.  But this moment doesn't carry the emotional impact that the similar moment did in the other three movies.<br /><br />Obi Wan Kenobi should be the Luke Skywalker for the first three episodes.  We don't develop an emotional understanding of Obi Wan Kenobi.  We are not prepared to see the great potential significance of Obi Wan giving into rage as he attacks Darth Maul.  Basically Obi Wan went to the dark side for a moment to defeat Darth Maul.  This stands in opposition to Luke's defeat of the Emperor in episode VI.  Obi Wan has evidenced a weakness that represents a crucial character flaw that impacts everything that happens afterwards.  Obi Wan's rage makes him a less than adequate mentor for a young Anakin who has a real problem with anger.  It is this crucifixion between love and the patience to choose other than a quick course decided by hatred for those who have destroyed what you love that must be chosen by the Jedi.  Otherwise, the dark side prevails.<br /><br />This movie needed to explore the source of Obi Wan's rage and its consequences in order to give us a profound moment of \\"Oh no!\\" when he turned himself loose on Darth Maul.  I believe that it would not have taken much to create that effect given the rest of the plot.  Even if Obi Wan had a quick counseling session with Yoda afterwards and admitted his feelings in the moment in his fight with Darth Maul and a concerned response on Yoda's part regarding how his foresight has becomes significantly more clouded (as he mentions in episode II) might have been helpful.<br /><br />Otherwise, I find the movie as engaging in every other sense as the previous movies.  I just think that this episode and episode II both lack this personal spiritual climax that we were spoiled with in the other three episodes.ore clouded (as he mentions in episode II) might have been helpful. <br /> <br />Otherwise, I find the movie as engaging in every other sense as the previous movies.

B0006A9FMI|1.0|Despite being a fan of Oshii's work (and GITS in general) I missed out on seeing this in the cinema. A couple months back I'd read about the oopsie-daisy close-captioned subtitle only issue but forgot about it when I bought the disk yesterday, only to be painfully reminded when I tried to watch INNOCENCE last night. Talk about a ruined experience! I seriously didn't even get five minutes into it before I had to shut it off. And while I'm grateful (shrug) for the DVD replacement offer, it still sucks that I have to wait almost a whole month to get the corrected disk in the mail. Oh, and regarding the subs-vs-dubs issue, I'm kind of a purist when it comes to keeping a film in its original context, especially when it comes to foriegn language films. Poorly done overly-dramatic dubs by US/Canadian \\"actors\\" who don't have the slightest grasp of the thematic elements of the story don't do the production justice. If you want to marvel at the animation, just watch it once with the subs on to catch the dialogue, then watch it again with the subs off and bask in the artistry. Very simple, very easy. Hopefully the correctly subtitled version of INNOCENCE will ease the pain of this should-have-been-easily-avoided snafu.
B000641Z90|4.0|I've been a diehard Genesis fan from the old days.  Love Peter for Peter, but Phil pulled the band together as a unit far more effectively until \\"Genesis\\", as far as I'm concerned.  The pop approach suited him much better than the pensive, romantic style of Mike and Tony, who sounded like a string quartet playing Depeche Mode once the latter day stuff came out.  I love both their voices.<br /><br />While my tastes do not lean toward peppy pop, when I listen to this music with some years in between this and my Lamb/Wind and Wuthering heyday, I realize that this is just darned fine pop.  he works his butt off, the music is full of hooks and high-points, some silliness, but it is Pop Art, and it makes me happy.  Would I like a reunion of prog-era Genesis?  Absolutely.  but for what it is, this is a great show, full of love and effort and world-class playing.  And, though it may not matter to some, there is an all-too-brief nuclear drum solo, the only one (save for an obscure Brand X CD, Live at the Roxy) on legitimate record by Phil, which contrasts with the more conventional fireworks of the wonderful Chester Thompson, followed by an astounding drum duo and trio with master percussionist Luis Conte.  Phil's solo and the percussion ensemble are  pieces of music, not gymnastics, complete with fancy tricks and crowd pleasers, but as close to a drum \\"song\\" as you're likely to find in the mainstream.<br /><br />So liking Phil ain't cool.  Tough.  This is one of the hardest working, crowd-pleasing,  laugh-at-yourself and have a good time, heart on his sleeve performers out there.  And the DVD offers enough goodies to make for a great farewell gift for his fans.<br /><br />So it's not \\"deep\\" - but it is fun pop artistry.  Just enjoy it.  There's plenty of serious progressive music out there to go around.  What's so bad about a simple song with a groove, played at a world class level?  Nuff said.
068987474X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and have recommended it to all of my single girlfriends.   <br /> <br />Another book that gives advice to women is, 'The Ladies Who Lunch; A Middle Aged Woman's Guide to Modern Morality.\\"  This book is a novel set in the Chicago area but it gives good insight to women, especially middle aged women, who have not had that much experience with men and who suddenly find themselves single again after many years of marriage. <br /> <br />The middle aged women in this novel were brought up with strict Christian and Victorian values and morals which have ill prepared them to deal with the morally loose society in which they now live. <br /> <br />We girls need all the advice we can get when it comes to dealing with men.  Not understanding or appreciating the male of the species can lead to many loney nights and broken hearts.
B00005JN0T|4.0|I, Robot may not be the best science fiction movie of all time, but it does have an interesting tale patched up with some Will Smith humor to make it an enjoyable one. The movie begin by telling us the three laws that all robots must obey. I. Robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm. II. Robot must obey orders given by a human being except where such orders conflict with the 1st law. III. A robot must protect its own existence as long as it does not conflict with the 1st and 2nd law. The setting is in Chicago in the year 2035 where robots are doing many jobs that us humans do today such as being garbage men, cooking, and helping old folks around the area. The creation of robots has the whole town delighted expect for one cop. His name is detective Spooner (Will Smith). Spooner doesn't trust any robots as he believes that they are the exact oppostie of what they are supposed to be. His believes become more evident as Dr. Lanning fell about 4 or 5 stories to his death who happens to be the one in charge of the making of the robots. Everyone preceives Mr. Lannings death as a suicide but Spooner begs to differ. He feels that the robots are responsible for his death. His believes pinpoint him to a robot called Sonny who is unlike the other robots. He can write, think, have emotions and even have dreams. Spooner feels that Sonny is the man responsible for Mr. Lannings death but noone wants to believe him especially since robots are machinery designed to protect humans. Eventually Dr. Susan Calvin (Lanning's assistant) begins to see a different side of Sonny she is not using to seeing and is finally convinced that the robots may not be what she perceived them to be. Detective Spooner's beliefs start to come to life when one robot tried to destroy Mr. Lannings house when he was in there trying to dig up clues and when he was driving and ran into a truck full of robots popping out and attacking him. Of course, Spooner has noevidence of what the robots did and begins to go into an outrage that leads him to being suspended from the police force. However, Spooner refuses to give up. He continues to confront Sonny to find out what's going on. Sonny reveals that he was part of Dr. Lanning's special creation and was not obligated to follow the three laws. Lanning made him to fulfill a purpose by what that purpose was, Sonny didn't really know. We discover many other interesting clues. The main reason why Sponner dislikes robots was because he had a an auto accident that caused a big truck to knock him and another car with a 12 year old girl off the bridge and into a river. A robot came and saved him because he had a greater chance of living although he begged the robot to save the girl instead.   We discover that the  mastermind in causing the robots to act the way that they are is not a person or a robot but Vicki (the computer system) that was supposed to program the robots to follow these laws but instead doesn't obey Dr. Lanning and now we have an army full of robots wrecking havoc all over the city. Now Sonny, Spooner, and Calvin must protect the city, destroy the robots, and destroy the Vicki. In the end, we discover that Dr. Lanning did instruct Sonny to kill him and use him to help Detective Spooner to destroy Vicki and her evil intentions. Sonny go out and lives the human life but it looks like he will be leading it in a positive manner. This movie may not be as fun to watch as the Matrix, Men In Black, or the Fifth Element, but the idea behind a robot murdering a human portrays in interesting story. I loved the parts where Spooner told one of the doctors that he was allergic to b.s. and the lead detective said he will miss the good ol' days when people killed people. I think it's worth checking out

B000683VI4|2.0|I am of the utmost belief that Kleenex was a sponsor of this film.  It has been a very long time since Hollywood released a \\"true\\" tearjerker film, and I know that Kleenex couldn't help but try to get a piece of the action.  I know that my wife went through at least ten Kleenex by the time this film was over and she had read the book.  Imagine what it would be like for those that didn't see this film coming.  I honestly feel they could go through a whole box.  Ironically, and corporately minded, I went through no Kleenex as I watched this film, but instead found my mind wandering and trying at any opportunity to search for any chemistry between our lovebird characters.  From Garner and Rowlands to Gosling and McAdams, there was this sensation that they were nothing more than actors playing their part instead of the feeling of true love erupting from the screen.  Adding to this mess was a mixed bag of story lines that seemed as if Cassavetes was trying to make straight lines out of circles.  While this wasn't a horrible film by any means, The Notebook was perfect and its flaws cut very deep into this sad story.<br /><br />While I think Sparks' characters in his book are probably much better than in this story, I still wish he would have pushed harder for better actors or a bit more story.  There definitely seemed to be a lacking on both of these ends that hurt the overall feel of the film.  James Garner is old, and that was about the only thing that he had going for him.  Rowlands I can give some credit towards, but strangely I couldn't see these two working together.  Garner's passion towards Rowlands seems scripted, while there definitely wasn't anything between Rowlands and Garner.  It felt as if Garner was working too hard while Rowlands just didn't place any effort.  The Kleenex effect only occurred between these two characters, in my opinion, because they were old, and that seems to strike a chord with all of us.  Perhaps it is the grandparent effect or the fear of getting to that point in our lives, I felt that tears were shed near the end of the film because of their age, not their acting ability.  The same can be said for McAdams and Gosling.  McAdams did a decent job with the material given, but the slipping accent of Ryan Gosling was inexcusable and disturbing.  Gosling was completely miscast in this film.  I don't know if he was Cassavetes first choice for the role, but he just didn't capture the emotions that were deeply rooted in this film.  He read lines, gave some expression, but that was all.  I saw Ryan Gosling playing the character and not Noah on screen.  His eyes are what hurt him the most.  They just didn't seem to fit with what the character was trying to convey.  Each time the camera moved to his eyes, the film lost more credibility.  To build a great film that this could have been you need to staple it with strong players, sadly, this did not happen with The Notebook.  Feathers trying to be paperweights instead hold down this story.<br /><br />Then we have the story.  Sparks has a great imagination, and this story seemed like it would make a great story to tell on the written page, but not in film.  There were too many loose ends that were not covered or given enough respect for me in this film.  Allie's parents are one of them.  Allie's dad was hysterical looking as I kept hoping that I would see him whip out some Dapper Dan somewhere in the film.  Allie's Mom, Joan Allen, is not given enough time to defend herself and her climactic moment at the end seems a bit forced and boring than emotional.  We don't have enough information on her or this other character to really care about her big scene, instead it feels just like \\"filler\\".  There should have been more with Sam Shepard, who conveniently did not make it till the end of the film.  It felt as if he was written away because nobody knew what to do with him.  The same can be said of James Marsden's character who arrives, conquers, and leaves with no emotional response.  With many of these moments I felt we were given the short, short, short version instead of the emotional powerhouse this could have been.  The final scene that I found myself laughing at immensely was the entire \\"Noah going to war\\" bit.  The emotional scene during this brief interlude was completely forced and implausible.  I needed more during this moment to have my heart wretched out of me, and not just a scene to tie up any loose ends.  Cassavetes could handle this film, I think he just chose to throw too many elements into the fire that he could not fully develop, which hurt him in the long run.<br /><br />Overall, this film could have reached new levels, but instead cheapened itself to cater to those with low emotional control (the weepy) and lovers.  Everyone in love has their own story to tell that would probably make another person tear up, but that is what makes it your own. Cassavetes did not build a strong film with The Notebook, but instead used common clich&eacute;d Hollywood techniques to give the audience what they were hoping for, shallow characters that will make you cry.  Well, if you are looking for a film that literally cuts the drama and gives you the tears, this would be the film for you.  To everyone else, I say skip it.  There are better dramas that will burst your tear ducts longer than this one!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****no emotional response.

B0006284JQ|3.0|This review is not only about Greattest Hits, It's about Britney too. I think her songs are good: Opps... I Did it Again, Toxic, ...Baby One More Time. Even the CD is... fine. But, she hasn't got \\"THE VOICE OF THE MOMENT\\". 4 example, Jessica Simpson, is cute (like Britney), but she has this awesome voice, the one Britney hasn't. I think one of the reasons because Britney is where she is, is because she's \\"hot\\" and \\"sexy\\", not because she sings VERY good. Hey! I'm not saying Britney is a BAD singer, but... well... she's just OK.

B00008ADPF|5.0|Anyone who plays this album in their car will instantly find themselves doing dashboard drums to these songs. They are catchy, powerful tracks and you'll want to hear them again. \\"Feeling way too damn good\\" is a hit you'll be hearing alot. I've heard a few people say that some of their songs sound similar and therefore have no originality. It's true that \\"Someday\\" and \\"How you remind me\\" sound alike because they follow a style. Nickelback produces grungy, low-thumping ballads and some heavy rock like \\"too bad\\" off Silverside Up. That is their formula. It's clear that Nickelback has outlived the quick, hot burning flame of hard alternative/nu-metal whatever you want to call it, it's not as popular as it was from '98-2002. These guys know how to make good music. This album is an exceptional new attempt. It sounds great. Alternative these days has turned to whiney sub-punk emo trash. It's refreshing to hear something that still has some balls and some power from guys that don't wear eyeliner.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for Hitch, I remember saying \\"this is going to be a corny movie\\".  When I went to the movie theater there was no certainty in my mind which movie I'd choose to watch.  I chose this movie because it was starring Will Smith.  And I'm glad I did.  I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised in watching this movie.  I liked Eva Mendes alot already.  And this movie only made me like her that much more.  They worked very well together (Will & Eve).   <br /> <br />I don't like the term \\"romantic comedy\\", but that's exactly the category this movie falls under.  It's a good movie overall that keeps you interested the whole way thru.  I recommend it to all Will Smith fans.  Eva Mendes was a pleasant surprise.  <br /> <br />Watch & enjoy.  4 1/2 stars **** <br /> <br />
B00001MXXH|4.0|After watching this movie for the first time in several years, I was struck by a thought: what kind of person would Ferris grow up to be?    My guess is that Ferris would grow up to be a guy who loses about six jobs a year. Unfortunately, that's the reality of life: smart alec kids have to grow up sometime, even if they're as cool as Ferris.    And that's the beauty of Ferris. He's an eternal teenager, captured in that nexus between childhood and adulthood that we all had to endure. But nobody endured it as well as Ferris does, which is why he's so lovable.    Much has been written about the humor in Matthew Broderick's performance, but little has been written about the tone. Broderick is tone-perfect - a little more mellow, and you have Bill and Ted; a little more manic, and you have Jon Cryer. Ferris is cool, but not unflappable. He's cocky, but slightly unsure of the future. He's a smart aleck, but he's earnest, and he's brave to boot. He's the quintessential teenager, albeit one who does things that all of us wish we'd had the balls to do.    And Ferris is all too aware that this magical time in his life is going to end pretty soon. That truth adds an almost subliminally sad subtext to this film, which is ostensibly about being an exuberant teenager. That's a pretty neat trick for a movie that's supposed to be little more than a silly teenage romp, isn't it?    Eventually, all of us have to grow up. All except Ferris, that is. We never have to watch his teenage precociousness turn into grown-up irresponsibility. Hell, that's what happens to us all at some point, and it will never happen to Ferris.     Isn't that the beauty of this movie? By seeing Ferris in his eternal teenage glory, maybe we can all catch a glimpse of the funny, rebellious, cocky, noble people we all once were during that period between childhood and adulthood - and probably never will be again.     By the way, the suggestion that this film is lost on subsequent generations is absolute twaddle.This is one of my nine-year-old daughter's favorite movies.
B000089RV6|5.0|Many AC/DC fans say this is their masterpiece. I say it's awesome, but my pick for best AC/DC is Highway To Hell. But this album ain't far behind. It contains AC/DC best known songs. The guitar solos are great. Angus Young is a great guitarist. His brother,Malcolm, young plays rhythmn guitar and he's pretty good as well. The bass is pretty good. But Brian Johnson's vocals aren't that good. I perfer Bon Scott's vocals. No offense to Brian, he's a good singer, but I just perfer Bon Scott. And lastly, the drumming, is ok, but after a while it just gets repatitive. Now I will review my favorite tracks...<br /><br />1. Hells Bells-5/5-Classic song. The intro reminds me of \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" by Metallica. I wonder why...<br /><br />6. Back In Black-5/5-Okay, we've all heard this song, so I guess there's really nothing for me to say that hasn't been said.<br /><br />7. You Shook Me All Night Long-5/5-I love this song. My favorite off the album. I love the lyrics \\"She was a fast machine/She was the best damn woman I've ever sene\\"<br /><br />10. Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution-5/5-The classis outro. Another great song.<br /><br />All in all, Back In Black is a great album. It is mandotory for ALL rock music fans. Buy this and Highway To Hell for AC/DC's best albums.

Hey, wasn't that the basic plot of \\"Taxi Driver\\"? <br /> <br />In addition to being a cinematic touchpiece for generations of filmmakers, \\"The Searchers\\" stands on its own as a truly great film experience, probably most notable for its stunning visuals, John Wayne's greatest performance, and a slightly more nuanced approach to the \\"cowboys and Indians\\" conflict that marked the coming of the revisionist Western. <br /> <br />If nothing else, \\"The Searchers\\" is a gorgeous film to look at, with some of the most well-known visuals in film history. The most famous images, of course, are of the opening and closing \\"doorway\\" shots, but the desert scenes have enduring grace and power. If Wayne is the star of this film, the desert is his co-star. <br /> <br />Wayne's complex, powerful portrayal of Ethan not only defined his career, but also helped define a new kind of character that would soon become known as an \\"antihero.\\" Before long, the antihero would redefine cinema in films like \\"Bonnie and Clyde,\\" \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\\" and even \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\\" <br /> <br />Much has been written about the attitude towards native Americans in \\"The Searchers,\\" but this much is pretty clear: it's a whole lot more nuanced than the Westerns of its day. The famous climactic scene in which Wayne's character picks up his niece (who he'd vowed to kill because she was living with Cherokees) and takes her home seems to be an admittance that his bigotry is wrong. When the door literally closes on Wayne's character in the movie's legendary closing shot, the message is pretty clear: he might have done the right thing by bringing his niece home, but his attitudes are no longer acceptable, and he is denied redemption. <br /> <br />That's a pretty powerful anti-bigotry message by 1956 standards, and like so much else in \\"The Searchers,\\" it, too, lived on.
0316172324|2.0|Having spent a reasonable portion of my career trying to teach people to take a more objective view of things, I was a bit concerned this very-popular book was going to clash with -- and undermine -- all that work.  In reality, Blink seems to make a much stronger case for MORE deliberation (except in cases where instant reaction is required) than less. <br />The story of the inability of doctors to accurately \\"triage\\" potential heart attack victims is perhaps the best case.  In an example of anti-thin-slicing, the primary warning factors were identified only through exhaustive research and correlation analysis. So much for \\"gut feel\\"! <br />The opening case of the statue scam just shows that people need to learn to better \\"understand\\" their own instant analyses--why these supposedly insightful art people (who recognized the scam) could not more definitively explain that the object was \\"too perfect\\" just shows they need to be less enamoured with their intuitive judgment and more connected with facts.  (Sorry if this gives some of the book away). <br />Anyway, I can see why people enjoy Blink.  There are some interesting stories. But I cynically wonder if Mr. Gladwell is hoping people blink as they read the book, because if they look too carefully they'll see it never really makes a point.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Saying this movie is stupid is like saying the Sistine Chapel is pretty. <br /> <br />It doesn't convey the overwhelming epic nature of its' stupidity. This film goes for \\"stupid\\" in a colossal fashion. Swings for the fences. <br /> <br />But here's the thing: it's not dumb.  <br />Oh no, not a bit.  <br />It's actually an intentionally moronic tweak of \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", with overt nods to \\"The Godfather Part II\\", music videos... <br /> <br />...Zoolander has been brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia during a fashion show. <br /> <br />Derek refers to him as the \\"Prime Rib of Propecia\\". See? Stupid, but stupid funny. <br /> <br />There's a small role given to a guy who explains \\"the truth\\" to the whole plot to the two main characters. His casting is perfect. <br /> <br />The truth is definitely out there, and I giggled during the entire scene. <br /> <br />Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, world's greatest male model. His real-life father plays his agent; Jon Voight plays his father in the film. His real-life wife plays his love interest. Owen Wilson plays the rival model Hansel. <br /> <br />No one with that sort of nose could ever (in a non-stupid world) be a superstar male model, which fits perfectly here. The camera almost lingers on that proboscis. <br /> <br />Will Ferrell again shows up with such a wigged-out performance that I would not be surprised if one day he is discovered to come from another planet. The guy's a loon. <br /> <br />In fact, I'm giving this an extra star (it's a good, solid 3+) simply due to the absolutely hilarious cameos sprinkled throughout the movie. Some may find this \\"stupid\\", but that's this film's raison d'etre. Come on...David Bowie judging a runway \\"walk-off\\"? <br /> <br />So realize that maybe only seven brain cells will fire while you're watching this. <br />Those seven will be pretty amused...
0618526412|5.0|Not many writers are able to at his/her early twenties to have such a exquisite view of the world and complex subjects as Carson McCullers displays in her beautiful \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\". Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.<br /><br />Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).<br /><br />In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of \\"man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible\\". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.<br /><br />Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.<br /><br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.<br /><br />Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, \\"The heart is a lonely hunter\\" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness.rative. <br /> <br />Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Okay, this is one of the best performances of U2 ever.  As far as missing songs, sad that they overlooked full sets by Sting, Phil Collins, Bryan Ferry, and the Pretenders, but...geesh...am I glad for the fast forward on my remote.  There is nothing worse than sitting through a song that some performer thought would be a two continent crowd pleaser.  Most of the sets captured caught the best performances of the day as it should. <br /> <br />Wembley had the best band lineup.  I distinctly remember watching it live back in the day and remarking that CSN had one of the worst performances of their life and I love CSN.  I would rather have bad CSN edited out than put forward as their best work.   <br /> <br />I don't think anyone will be too upset to have a Status Quo song cut; I can't believe they left in 2!   <br /> <br />However, if there are younger viewers they should be encouraged to go listen to all Style Council and Ultravox albums as they weren't really captured in depth on the dvd and created pretty lush music for the time.
B00005OM5L|5.0|This one is a keeper. EC and his band are at their best, whether it's a blues tune or a rocker. The 5.1 audio mix is outstanding and the video is second to none. This is one great performance to be enjoyed over and over. Can't say enough about this DVD, it's my favourite to date. A must for any music/guitar fan.
0393035158|5.0|We humans are travellers on an unimaginably long journey that has taken us from blobs in a primordial swamp to intelligent and self-aware beings that have developed the power to create and destroy on a scale that our brains are unable to fully comprehend.  Mr. Harris' book provides us with incontrovertible evidence that this journey have not been in vain.   <br /> <br />This erudite work should be read by every literate citizen of the world.  Nearly all of us come across irrationality in our lives, mostly in the form of religion and yet, if we are even able to recognize such ideas as irrational, most of us are wholly unequipped intellectually to offer an opposing point of view.  This book will help to remedy this situation.  <br />
B00009V7T2|5.0|De-Loused has to be the single handedly most creative piece of music since Pink Floyds The Wall.  It's an epic CD that tells the story of the character Cerpin Taxt, who falls into a coma and goes through a nightmarish expirience. <br /> <br />The CD is a little over 62 minutes long and breaks all musical barriers.  The most stand out tracks are probably Roulette Dares, Cicatriz ESP, and Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt.  This album is a molding of hardcore punk, salsa, jazz, and classic rock.  A definate must listen for those who arent into the watered down pop rock that dominates todays culture
0743243315|5.0|The author has a beautiful writing style, and is able to delve into the sensitive issues affecting an Islamic minority subculture during the events of September 11th. She succeeds because it is done through the eyes of Nanzeen, someone who believes in her religion strongly, but not in violence, and silently but diligently observes those within her community. <br />  <br />To me the book is about Nanzeen- and she is engaging. <br />She is a young village girl propelled into London where she meets her selected husband, does as he says(he is good for he does not beat her-this is her initial diagnosis), speaks only her native tongue, and her husband discourages any outside work or classes to learn the language. <br />She transforms, through trials of her own, and those of her sister, into a woman with her own income, a lover which plagues her with guilt, two children, and a husband she has come to care for over time. <br />Some say the book is tedious, or the letters are too long, or boring, but I think it well worth the read. Her writing is really beautiful in itself, and the book gives a really different insight into the events surrounding Sep. 11th, and the repercussions thereafter.

B000007ODX|5.0|In comparing other performaces to Barenboim's DG disc, I find that he captures the mood and essence of the nocturnes like no other has done.  These pieces are not difficult to play, and being a virtuoso does not add to the interpretation of these pieces.  Sure others certainly have had more dazzling performances and cleaner fingerwork than Barenboim, but this served to distract more than enhance this style of music--afterall, these pieces are for small, intimate audiances, not large concert halls.  Barenboim is almost self-less in these pieces--I can do no better to explain it than this.
B00005K9LM|5.0|As a Judas Priest fan since around 1980, it is hard to identify their greatest work. They've obviously progressed through so many stages of sound since the early records. But Defenders of the Faith is the record I first think of when I look back on the heavy metal machine that Judas Priest was. Right from the opening track, Freewheel Burning reaches out and starts pounding your skull (in a good way) and it continues throughout the record. Even the slower paced song is crunching and heavy in its own right and the album ends with a hard driven anthem which completely fits the Judas Priest message. I still listen to this record to this day, some 20 years after buying it the first time around. It stands up to the hard rock that is available today and completely blew away anything from its era. The heavy drumming, bass and dual guitars, combined with Halford's ranging, screeching, yet melodic voice is amazing. This record would produce at least 4 songs that I would want to see on any Priest Greatest Hits record, and indeed, many are included on Metal Works. Freewheel Burning, The Sentinel, Love Bites, and Some Heads Are Gonna Roll are all Priest classics, and the other tracks like Jawbreaker, Rock Hard Ride Free, Eat Me Alive, etc., stand on their own feet as well. All steak, no filler here. Play it loud and play it proud. This album stands the test of time, as most JP records do, and sounds as good and as hard as ever, especially if you can crank it up loud where it can be truly appreciated. This record's predecessor, Screaming For Vengeance, was a great record and broadened the Priest's U.S. audience and directed their sound in a harder direction, but if you can only buy one Judas Priest album, Defenders of the Faith is the one that truly defines them as a band. This is one of those rare albums that completely rocks from the first track to the last. There is no chance that you will be disappointed owning this record, you'll just wonder why it took you so long to finally listen to it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Online Amazon Community,    I feel very compelled, almost driven to, to tell you how great a movie this is. I see that some people loved it and some people hated it. It's not for everyone but if you are open to it like Christian says in one scene, you might thoroughly enjoy it. Are you open to freedom, beauty, truth and most importatnly love? That is the basic question this movie asks. Can you get beyond the use of bad songs used to see beneath the surface? I never saw this movie because I don't love McGregor and Kidman and because I had heard about the use of pop music and since I am a professional musician of sorts I was turned off from the start. But I want to tell you to do yourself a favor and rent this movie. You will fall in love with it just like I have. I am so giddy right now and drunk on this movie!
0316666343|2.0|I found this book mildly engaging but contrived. The characters were stereotypical and one-dimensional; the situations were predictable. One scene, in particular, made me mutter \\"Oh, come on\\" outloud.  <br /> <br />At the risk of sounding like a snob, I have found that books this popular are seldom very good from a literary standpoint. <br /> <br />This definitely fits in well with the Oprah type \\"woman's voyage of self discovery\\" tales.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|Even though you may not be a particular fan of George Patton, many are not, i.e. Andy Rooney, the little dweeb, see this one anyway.  George C. Scott in his role as Patton, gives us one of the best performances in recent history.  The movie is worth watching his work if for no other reason.  Other than that, yes, the movie is quite well done.  The DVD edition may indeed have been slightly cut here and there but this in no way distracts from Scott's performance nor does it take anything away from the story.  I have viewed both the original and the DVD and there is little difference.  This has become a true classic and I highly recommend.
B0002858YS|5.0|As you may have noticed over the past year or two, there have been various bands with 'the' prefix, and most of those bands have not made music challenging or interesting. <br /> <br />The Killers are not that kind of band. <br /> <br />Instead, they are a band who spices up electronica / progressive rock, reminiscent of the 80s, full of life, glamour and issues at hand and heart. <br /> <br />I discovered the Killers through \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" and then \\"Somebody Told Me\\" which is a highly addictive feel good song, with it's catchy lyrics and up driven tempo. <br /> <br />Brandon Flowers, the lead singer, has almost of a Gary Newman voice when he sings, but he also does sing fully on some songs. Such songs as \\"Midnight Show\\" are similiar to U2's first hit, \\"I Will Follow\\", while other songs are definitely refreshing to hear, such as the almost ballad \\"All These Things I've Done\\" which features a choir and one of the most coolest lines in a song, \\"I've got soul, but I'm not a soldier.\\" <br /> <br />The Killers are all about being cool, but they don't try to be cool -- they just come across to you as cool, you'll hear a song like \\"On Top\\" and the ending lyrics are \\"It's like a cigarette in the mouth, or a handshake in the door way\\" -- it's lyrics like that that make you smile and think. <br /> <br />Other great songs such as \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" and \\"On Top\\" are feel good rock tunes, to get lost in this minute, and not worry about the future.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, check out the Killers, an overall great and cool band.
B000003TSP|4.0|Portishead created a unique sound in their debut \\"Dummy,\\" combining smoky jazz and trip-hop. So an equally good follow-up was a pretty tall order. Enter the self-titled \\"Portishead,\\" which ups the eerie noir feel while not abandoning the cool electronic edge. In the months before their return, it seems appropriate to revisit their older material.<br /><br />\\"Did you feed us tales of deceit,/Conceal the tongues who need to speak?/Subtle lies and a soiled coin,/The truth is sold, the deal is done,\\" Beth Gibbons intones, sounding like a slightly gleeful robot. That sets the tone for \\"Portishead,\\" giving it a darker tone than its predecessor -- darker songs, darker vocals, darker music.<br /><br />The jazz overtones are still there, bubbling up in songs like the distant \\"Over\\" and \\"Seven Months,\\" which sounds strangely like fellow trip-hop artist Emiliana Torrini. Only the downtempo \\"Over\\" and softly poppy \\"Western Eyes\\" break from this cooler sound, sounding warm and unaltered. The rest of the album is a different story.<br /><br />Somehow it adds to the noir atmosphere to have darker, colder sounds woven in with the jazzy trip-hop. \\"Humming\\" includes a strange background beat that sounds exactly as you would imagine a UFO. This dark, experimental edge makes it a bit harder to get into than their debut album, but when you do get into it, it's almost frighteningly intense.<br /><br />The jazzy percussion is one of the first things you notice about this, paired with horns and thick synth. It's surprisingly heady to listen to. Also cold and distant -- which seems appropriate, since the simple lyrics focus on loneliness, melancholy, sadness and loss (\\"Why should I forgive you,/After all that I've seen,/Quietly whisper,/When my heart wants to scream?\\").<br /><br />Beth Gibbons plays around with her vocals this time around -- while Gibbons's voice is normally very pretty, in a few songs she twists it into creepy monotones. It's a bit jarring at first, compared to her usual melodic singing, but it suits the darker songs here. The filtered, eerie intonations in \\"Cowboys\\" are downright spine-chilling.<br /><br />Portishead, presently working on their long-awaited third album, made a triumphant second album. While not as easily accessible as their debut, it's definitely an entrancing experience.er usual melodic singing, but it suits the darker songs here.

B000003N7G|5.0|I resort many times to this record when I really want to get carried away with music. For me this record is medicine. So Coltrane, Tyner, Jones and Garrison are here like a group of  therapists so to speak.  <br />This one is truly unique. Never listened to something even similar and don't want to. Because \\"A love supreme\\" is just perfect. I have other Coltrane works like \\"Giant Steps\\" or \\"Blue Train\\" but these ones don't mean much to me. And I even don't like much John's way of playing: too many notes in such a little time space. Many times they don't tell me anything. And it is the same reaction that I get sometimes from Bird. \\"Ok, you're a virtuoso. Congratulations!. So what?\\". <br />But this record was really his cornerstone for me. He was in a different approach. He meant something to me in every note he blew from his sax. He really got into something. And he's here with the great McCoy Tyner. With his piano helps Elvin Jones to create a mystic atmosphere where you can feel they are in some kind of spiritual voyage. And everything is a wonder.  <br />So if you are one like me who's not very fond of Coltrane, it doesn't matter at all. This is a must have. Who told you that \\"Kind of Blue\\" was the all-time best?. It is \\"a love supreme\\". It is about pure inspiration from four geniuses of Music. It'll change you. For good!.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I've read the comments here and am strangely encouraged by the fact that so many intelligent opinions can be so completely polarized. It shows me that film still has the power to enthrall.....and infuriate.....cinephiles around the world. <br /> <br />Personally I loved this film....if you can use \\"love\\" to describe a movie that battered me, sickened me, mesmerized me, drained me and left me feeling as if I had been kicked in the gut.  <br /> <br />The theme of \\"time destroys everything\\" is not new in the world of art. It is a concept that becomes frighteningly real to us as we get older. In this film, Gasper Noe shows us the tragic outcome of a series of events before allowing us to view these events in reverse chronological order. By doing so he has given us a god's eye view over the lives of the main characters. This gives the subsequent scenes an ever deepening sense of irony and despair, more than a conventional storyline could ever hope to achieve. It also gives the audience a deep sense of personal despair...for even though we know what's going to happen, we remain powerless to intervene. Time destroys everything, and it is unstoppable. <br /> <br />Much has been said regarding the explicit sex and violence as well as the spinning camerawork at the film's beginning. There is no gratuitous exploitation here...what we are forced to witness is raw, realistic and merciless. We may long to run away from the horror and pretend it isn't there, much like the faceless witness in the tunnel (a brilliant device), but when we open our eyes it is still there. In a genre where sex and violence have become commonplace these scenes will shake-up all but the most jaded moviegoer. <br /> <br />The camerawork was also essential for it expertly mirrors the turmoil of the characters. As the film opens all is chaos...emotions are past the breaking point and mindless brutality rules the mind. The camera swoops and spins, rolls and ducks, it is completely unbalanced and out of control....a sign of intense control on behalf of the director. The lighting is dark, the colours lurid. Compare this to the long, sunny takes towards the end of the film (and the beginning of the story). <br /> <br />This is not a simple story told backwards...rather, it is a meditation on fate, destiny, and free will. Is our future already written? Are our actions pre-determined?  <br /> <br />\\"Irreversible\\" is a cinematic Memento Mori that I look forward to seeing again and again. 10/10 (or for amazon's sake 5/5).  <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|Rockers rejoice!  This is one of the best rock albums I have ever heard.  I've been a rock fan since the 50's and this one has it all.  It is a dynamic rock opera with strong tunes and an attitude about what's screwed up with this country.  I notice our local Wal-Mart has not carried this CD.  What does that tell you?  I loved Jesus of Surburbia, American Idiot, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and really the entire album is very enjoyable.  It's about time a rock group stepped forward with a protest album for these times.  As I write this, we just got word that developers plan to rape our pristine land and build 1700 homes and another empty golf course over some of the world's finest caves, here in Florida.  Listen to this album and you can understand the seething rage that many have in this country.  This is Green Day's peak, and I feel will go down as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.
B00000AF98|1.0|I remember back in 1987 when I first bought \\"Crazy Nights.\\"  I thought it was pretty good back then.  I recently picked it up again to add to my library of good and bad metal music madness.  In doing so, I found that my tastes in music have changed.  So much so, that, when I heard this album again 12 years later I was bewildered.  Sure, I knew the songs but, I didn't remember all those keyboards!  This is one of a couple of Kiss' bad marketing attempts.  I guess Kiss couldn't think of any new music that was better at the time to compete with the likes of, UGH!  Bon Jovi, Warrant, Poison and Cinderella (BWA HA HA!!!).  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em and Kiss did just that.  \\"Crazy Nights\\"  has very little input from Gene Simmons and may be just as well.  His songs, for the most part just ai'nt the kind of Gene songs I want to hear.  Although, I will give a thumbs up for Bruce Kulick's fretwork on the song, \\"No No No\\".  It reminds me of how popular and how bloated the \\"hair band\\" wave was and all those fancy guitarists with thier poofy hairdoos were all screaming \\"look what I can do!\\"  Paul Stanley, who is the primary songwriter on \\"Crazy Nights\\" was in full, 1980's hair metal form.  Sure, his songs made a couple of hits at the time but now...   it's just totally dated.  \\"Crazy Nights\\" is nothing like it's predecesors.  Whereas, Kiss were leaders with albums like \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Over,\\" they became followers with cd's such as this one and the later, \\"Hot in the Shade.\\"  Also, Kiss brought in a lot of outside writers for this album.  People like Desmond Child who wrote \\"Bang, Bang You\\" and \\"Reason to Live\\" with Paul and Dianne Warren who co-wrote \\"Turn on the Night\\" with the former starchild.  This album is very commercial and is a bad moment in the career of Kiss.  It was ok for the 80's but not for now.  \\"Crazy Nights\\" does not stand the test of time.
B000065U1N|5.0|First I must state that I'm somewhat confused by many of the negative reviews here. One recurring complaint is that in this movie, Somalis are depicted as a faceless swarm, which is dehumanizing, racist et cetera. I cannot but think that they aren't very familiar with war movies as a genre. As a rule such movies focus on one side, which has the effect of dehumanizing the other side. There are limited opportunities for showing the humanity of others, since the characters tend to look at them down the barrel and shoot on sight. Not zero, though.  <br /> <br />Of this, ironically enough, Black Hawk Down is a prime example. The humanity of Somalis is shown many times and in many ways, though to notice this tends to require some attention to detail. They even get a chance to explain some of their point of view in two dialogues, which is two more than average war movie gives to enemy. But I suppose that a determined ideologue could see them as Western Patriarchy's racist-imperialist mythmaking or some such thing, aiming to portray Somali civil war as born from their ancient cultural heritage and by blaming the victims of West, justify the postcolonial hegemony of privilege. Incidentally I found those parts rather scornful of US for its occasional naivete, but then again I hadn't decided in advance that this film is 100% pro-America. <br /> <br />As a movie, this was a rare bird. Generally, war movies either glamorize war or are anti-war. BHD was neither. It didn't pull any punches in showing the nauseating brutality of modern warfare, it lacked the flag fetishism of most Hollywood war movies and its atmosphere is best captured by the quote from Plato in the beginning: \\"Only the dead have seen the end of war.\\" Then again, the professionalism, discipline and bravery of US elite troops, and their spirit of brotherhood, are shown as well. This movie isn't built around some particular opinion of war's moralities, rather it is built around the experience of war itself and leaves the interpretations to viewer. Some may be disturbed by this lack of clear moral lessons, but for me, Black Hawk Down was all the more moving and thought-provoking for it.

B0002MPU1K|3.0|I love the title track to this cd.  Beyond that I don't find much to distinguish it.  It's not bad, in fact, for the most part, pretty enjoyable.  If you are able to choose any jazz cd I'd recommend trying something else.  If you are at Wal-Mart and the selection is pretty limited and you are curious (my circumstance when I picked this up) than go ahead.  I'd like to hear a little more spontaneity and a little less production.  I suspect Mr. Cincotti can play the piano a little bit; it'd be nice if they would let him provide a touch more evidence.  At the risk of throwing the names of legends around, the vocals kept reminding me of Chet Baker.  Not your normal vocal technique, but interesting and even pleasant.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I bought this double CD the week it came out in 1998.  I loved a lot of the songs on there!  The ballads still sound good, thought the first CD tends to drag in the middle. His remake of the Bonnie Raitt song isn't all that exciting.  I still like Mother's Child, Jesus To A Child, Older, Praying for Time, One More Try from Faith (his best ballad), Father Figure and others. But the second CD says a lot about George Michael as an artist!  He can tear it up on songs like the Monkey remix, Too Funky, Fastlove, Outside, Faith, and one other song from Faith. Although George's recent albums have not sold as well, this collection represents the best from his three solo albums, songs from soundtracks, and live performances. It showcases him as a solid performer, musician and songwriter.
B00005J6T0|3.0|Each song stands on its own. They are very strong, catchy, and positive. But these songs together as an album, there is little totalness. The totalness of Like A Prayer or Ray Of Light is not in True Blue. Yet the cover photo is the best of all Madonna albums.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I just bought this CD and I love it!  I had waited a bit on buying it, and I'm kinda sorry I did.  My least favorites are #s 10 & 11, but even those are good.  Great CD.  I recommend it for everyone.  The songs are well written and really catchy.  I don't listen to that much current music, but I like this chick.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ah, Radiohead.  I bought \\"OK Computer\\" nearly seven years ago, spurred on by a local radio stations repeated playing of the single \\"Paranoid Android\\". I went out on a limb and bought the album, thinking, \\"These are the guys who did \\"Creep\\"?!\\"  It is now one of my all-time, desert-island-must-have albums - rarely a week goes by without my having to listen to at least one song from it. But how to describe the music? Haunting, yes, and dark, but brilliant. Shining, clear, pulse-pounding. And the lyrics (albeit the ones you can understand - Thom Yorke can sound a little mush-mouthed to an American) really get stuck in your head. It's the type of music to keep you company on a rainy day. If you're hesitant about buying this album, I say just do it. And listen to it with headphones on, or in a dark room cranked up as loud as your neighbors can stand. Listen to it a couple of times - let it soak into your vertabrae. For me, it was a life changing experience - I haven't been moved to such emotional heights by a band in looong time. Radiohead has become one of my top 5 favorite bands for life thanks to \\"OK Computer\\". I hope it does the same for you.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Russell Crowe as Captain Aubrey portrays a man brave, driven, yet compassionate and very human.  Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor is his perfect foil ~ sensitive, inquisitive, idealistic and every bit as steely and courageous.  Disimilar but alike in many ways, both men are devoted to cause and calling, their differences enhancing and playing off one another to create a vibrant, strong friendship not unlike a good marriage.  Almost stealing the show is young Max Pirkis as a precocious lad with a prodigious courage of his own and a keen intelligence who is nurtured and respected by captain, doctor and crew.  As for the crew, a fine supporting cast breathes life into the varied and various souls aboard the HMS Surprise, individuals colorful and believable and stained by sweat and the salt of the sea, a character unto itself  in all its many moods.<br /><br />Stirring battle scenes, a realistic portrayal of naval life,  highly satisfying and above all historically accurate.  Peter Weir has created a top drawer effort. Scenes are choreographed and shot beautifully.  A wonderful evening's entertainment.
0380789035|4.0|American Gods is the pinnacle in the great career of Neil Gaiman. A tapestry of unforgettable characters that take us all on a journey of History and self-discovery.

B00009W0U4|5.0|Yes, that's my honest opinion.    First, I thought, This guy doesn't know how to make a movie. (I had never seen a movie by director Noe.) Then I realized it was running from end to beginning.     After that, there was the killing scene. But first, Marcus had his arm broken. That was obviously a prop and the break looked too easy. A downer. If you want to be violent, do it more realistically. Ooops! Then the killing scene with a fire extinguisher. Well, two blows were enough, I thought. Six? Okay. Sounds good. TWENTY-THREE? That was too much. I was mesmerized, because there must have been a good reason.    Then, the ultra-long rape scene. I was nauseated. To tell you the truth, I am an advocate of the death penalty for rapists and this film confirmed my feelings.    Monica Bellucci is one incredible actress to put that performance the way she did. I do not believe there are many ladies who can do that type of scene. She is fantastic. Not to mention the difficulty of the whole episode. It was incredible.    After the end of this movie, I had ro recognize mastery in director Gaspar Noe and admire this film.
0670033375|5.0|Before, when a civilization faced environmental collapse, it only affected the region. Now, with a global civilization, we are facing an ecological disaster on a global scale. Diamond is very clever at writing his book now, when we can still do something about it. He brings to life civilizations who destroyed their environement, and therefore disappeared. He tries to explain that these societies were not evil, or stupid, or even careless, but that they failed to see the signs of the destruction they caused. We, however, can recognize the signs of the havoc we wreak. Some societies, like Iceland or Japan, recognized long ago the signs of enivronmental degradation. They have survived and are now among the most succesful societies around.  <br />Diamond makes us ask ourselves if we will be like the ancient Mayans, whose civilization collapsed because of overpopulation and poor resource management, or like the abovementioned Japanese. <br />Also, more chilling, several civilazations collapsed because trading partners collapsed. Again what will happen, in our global society where everyone is linked to everyone else via a trade network, if a major player collapses because of poor management of resources?
0446677450|5.0|I'm 18 Years old and doing a Business degree with majors in Accounting & Finance, before I read this book I was on track to becoming another standard middle class drone. All I was interested was getting good grades so I could get a good graduate position with a big 4 accounting firm and then work my way up the corporate ladder. <br /> <br />Now the only thing that I'm interested in is coming up with ideas for businesses and investments. I no longer just go to college to pass the exams; instead I go to learn how I'm going to use the techniques in the real world so that I can get on the fast track to wealth. <br /> <br />This book really did change my mind set, and that's all anybody should expect from this book and not to get some hot stock tip or secret real estate ideas. <br /> <br />I'm now reading Cash flow Quadrants & finding it really good for cementing the ideas of the first book. I'm looking forward to reading rich dad's guide to investing after this.
B00004NRWH|4.0|I started off as a fan of Nickelback after their Curb CD. Realising that they had a debut album I decided to buy this one and whilst many of the songs were listenable they were to me flat sounding. Nickelback was relatively knew on the music world stage and it took them sometime to get their footing and become well known. It was only ever going to be a matter of time.<br /><br />This CD is not going to be for everybody, however it is a introduction to how Nickelback sounded at the beginning and their musical evolution over a matter of time. I wish the band all the luck in the future and they have certainly improved 10 fold over the last few years.
6302194288|2.0|I find it odd that almost all the reviews on this page for Kino's VHS of VAMPYR are reviews of Image's DVD of VAMPYR.  Can no one out there read????? <br /> <br />The identical source print is used by both Kino for their VHS release (they have no plans to release a DVD version in the near future) and Image for their DVD release.  And the print is a very poor one indeed. <br /> <br />Aside from the intended softness of some of the images, the print is many generations removed from an original 35 nitrate source - Kino misleads on its cover and says it is a 35 mm archive print source. If this is a true statement, and I doubt it, it's the worst 35 mm source material I've ever seen. There are scratches, sprocket hole jumps, great fuzziness. <br /> <br />Face the fact though - it's all we have.  Criterion was unable to find a print good enough to even attempt to restore, thus its promise in 2000 to release a DVD of the title had to be reneged upon.  Criterion, and up until this instance, Kino, does not settle for less than pristine, crystal clear prints for its releases. This is the first time KINO has disappointed me in quality. <br /> <br />All the quality quibbling aside, buy either of these to view the film - just know what you're buying.  I think it's shameful that both Kino and Image charge the amount of money they do for this poor transfer. If it were a $5.98 special with warnings, it would be justified.
B000002KDO|5.0|I love this album.  I love the fuzzed out pummeling simple riffs of Tony Iommi, the nimble bass playing of Geezer Butler, the almost orchestral drumming of Bill Ward, of course Ozzy, the lyrics, everything.  This is the heaviest of the classic Sabbath albums, their third, and the boys weren't going for subtlty here.  This is primarily a head crushing fuzzfest of dark distorted Gibson SG power chords.  That said there are 3 anomalous songs: the two very short drumless instumentals Orchid and Embryo (which is embryonic in its simplicity and brevity) and the sad and dark ballad Solitude.  But oddly enough the two intrumentals songs act as a kind of brief intermission or palette cleanser and their odd, almost baroque sound fits right in with the heavy doom laden atmosphere of the rest of the album.  That atmosphere is Master of Reallities strength, this is a lyrically heavy album with the exception of Sweet Leaf, every dopers theme song.  The other songs show Sabbath's environmental concerns, their anti war stance and a pro love and god attitude on the song After Forever:  \\"god is the only way to love\\".  Many of these songs are cautionary tales of humanity out of balance.  For example Lord Of This World is a song sung from the perspective of Satan:  \\"you made me master of the world where you exist, the soul I took from you was not even missed.\\"  Into The Void, which has one of the most killer grooving riffs of all time, is a science fiction themed song about escaping planet earth, leaving it to the fools who would destroy it.  \\"Back on earth the flame of life burns low. Everywhere is misery and woe. Pollution kills the earth, the land and sea. Man prepares to meet his destiny.\\"  Yet there is hope at the end that life would continue.  Solitude is about loneliness, duh.  No burbling love ditties for Sabbath, this song is depressing, yet beautifully sung by Ozzy.  These boys were the heaviest thing on the planet circa 1971 musically and lyrically.  Negative this album may be, but it also leaves the listener with a positive outlook.  Things may be f*ed up, but it's not too late for you to determine your fate.  You are the master of reality.  A great album by the true fathers of heavy metal.be, but it also leaves the listener with a positive outlook.  Things may be f*ed up, but it's not too late for you to determine your fate.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Folks, I don't own this dvd, but I recently rented it. I have to say it did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, I normally LOVE Bill Murray, but somehow I think this is not one of his better storylines. Blah, very. Or maybe it just wasn't my style? Try it out and see if you agree.
B00000DFTG|3.0|The first record I ever bought was Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, I've been a fan for a long time and saw Sabbath on this reunion tour.  The show I saw was great fun, but that doesn't necessarily mean that a recording of the show will be as fun or will capture the emotion of being there.  This record isn't and doesn't.  Ozzy's exhortations to the audience to \\"f*ing rock man!\\" or \\"let me see some hands\\" swearing and between song banter gets old quick.  It was a lot more fun to be in the audience at the show singing the verses to War Pigs than to be sitting at home listening to a recording of people having a good time singing along.  I know I had a great time when I saw them.  The band sound good, the recording is sharp, both Ozzy and the crowd sound like they're having a blast, although live they were MUCH more powerful than this recording shows.  Unfortunately though, nothing new is added by the live renditions of fan favorites such as Fairies Wear Boots or Electric Funeral.  The studio versions are superior to these live recordings and while Reunion isn't bad at all, there is no reason to buy it other than for nostalgic purposes.  As for the two new studio songs, well let's just be kind and say that Black Sabbath's best years are behind them.  While the music is pummelling if not entirely original, the lyrics are among the worst Sabbath or Ozzy has ever done.  I might have thought that Psycho Man, a ho-hum by the numbers effort about a serial killer was cool when I was 14.  But I think even back then I would have been dissappointed by the ridiculously cheesy and totally conventional lyrics.  Oz gave that one maybe three minutes of effort.  As for the other song, I don't remember it.
0142004235|5.0|\\"East of Eden\\" is one of John Steinbeck's most fascinating and disturbing novels; a tale of envy, conflict and betrayal between two generations of brothers - Adam and Charles Trask, and Adam's twin sons, Aron and Caleb. The novel spans the period between the American Civil War and the end of World War I. Adam Trask grew up with his brother, Charles, on a farm in Connecticut. Their father clearly favored gentle Adam throughout their lives, leaving Charles, the wilder and more violent of the two boys, bitter and envious. Charles loved his father and brother deeply, but could never elicit the old man's affection. The jealousy he felt towards Adam gnawed at him constantly, and he finally left home to join the army. The brothers did not see each other for many years. Whenever Charles came home they argued relentlessly. And again Charles would go away. Finally, their father died, leaving both sons a fortune.<br /><br />Cathy Ames, a narcissistic, manipulative girl with few redeeming characteristics, plays a profoundly symbolic role in this Steinbeck novel. When she showed up at the Trask home one evening, beaten and close to death, Adam nursed her back to health. Gulled by Cathy's seeming vulnerability and beauty, he married her. She got him drunk on their wedding night, and while he slept, she had sex with Charles. Adam bought some land outside of Salinas, California, and moved there with his unwilling wife. He wanted to create an Eden for his Eve. Pregnant, and miserable at the thought of becoming a mother, Cathy tried to abort and failed. She stayed in Salinas long enough to give birth to fraternal twins, Aron and Caleb. Soon after their birth, Cathy abandoned her family, shooting her husband in the chest before exiting. Adam was so disturbed by the loss of his wife that he wanted little to do with his sons. The boys were raised by Lee, an Asian hired hand, who cared for them as his own. Samuel Hamilton, a neighbor and local philosopher, visited Adam frequently, attempting to jolt him out of his depression. On one occasion the two men discussed the biblical story of Cain and Able, Mr. Steinbeck's metaphor for this novel.<br /><br />Like their father and uncle, the twins constantly vie for their father's attention. Aron meets a young woman at school and becomes deeply attached to her. She is the first woman to show him affection. Caleb is beside himself with jealousy...and longing.<br /><br />The ensuing conflicts, and unnecessary alienation, between Aron and Caleb are heartbreaking. There is a painful scene when Adam repeats history, and tells Caleb, in spite of all the young man's efforts to please, that he should be more like his brother. The novel, however, does ends on a note of hope and redemption.<br /><br />I don't think Steinbeck's main characters are as fully developed, or as complex, as they could be because he is so intent on drawing similarities between them and their Biblical counterparts. In his retelling of the Cain and Abel story, Adam, Charles, Cathy, Aron and Caleb, are forced to reenact the ancient drama of exile from Eden. However the Biblical references are interesting, and the plot and subplots are tension-filled and moving. His secondary characters, Lee, Samuel, Abra, are beautifully drawn, realistic portraits of believable people. Their stories, histories and motives, are fascinating and add much to this deeply moving masterpiece by John Steinbeck.<br /><br />JANAempting to jolt him out of his depression.

0066620996|4.0|The author's thesis is that he knows how companies make the leap from \\"good\\" to \\"great,\\" and that he learned the principles by studying the statistical differences between companies that made the jump, and those that didn't.  <br /> <br />He begins by explaining his ability to \\"take a lump of unorganized information, see patterns, and extract order from the mess - to go from chaos to concept.\\" [page 11].  Collin's comment reminded me of another author, who wrote: \\"Human nature abhors a lack of predictability and the absence of meaning.  As a consequence, we tend to \\"see\\" order where there is none, and we spot meaningful patterns where only the vagaries of chance are operating.\\" [\\"How we know what isn't so,\\" Gilovich, page 9].  <br /> <br />While agreeing with many of his conclusions, this book lacks the statistical rigor the author ascribes to it.  The principal error involves confusion between causality and correlation.  Collins notes William P. Briggs' calculation that the probability of correlation by random chance is less than 1 in 17 million [211-212].  The calculation, while mathematically correct, is largely irrelevant because correlation does not mean \\"caused by.\\"  As an example, consider race cars which are highly correlated with advertiser's logos, although causality is clearly lacking because adding or stripping off logos won't suddenly make the cars go faster or slower.   <br /> <br />To strengthen his argument Collins should have specifically and methodologically examined the changes that happen to companies that go \\"from great to good.\\"  There are plenty of examples, including many of the \\"good-to-great\\" companies in Jim's data base.  Unfortunately, the study does this only sporadically and inconsistently, and as more of a sideline.  Compounding the problem is the fact that the author's statistical database applies only to major US companies (something he notes), though he tries to apply the \\"concepts\\" derived from these correlations to just about everything - including high school track teams and landlords. <br /> <br />In spite of some of the methodological errors in his approach, I remain impressed by the extent to which Collins collected large amounts of data, and the way he defined the most important terms that he uses.  It's true that he has a talent for finding \\"patterns,\\" but I found myself mostly agreeing with his conclusions, even if I don't share his enthusiasm for the supposed rigidity with which they were drawn.  In spite of the limitations of his work, Collins' book has a degree of rigor that's seldom approached by the plethora of evangelizing \\"management\\" and \\"leadership\\" tracts on the market.   <br /> <br />According to Collins, a \\"good\\" company has cumulative total stock returns no better than 1.25 times the general market for at least 15 years, while a great company is one that beats the general market by 3 times for at least 15 years. His selection criteria and method of ranking companies is relatively robust.  Some of the ranking methods are obviously more quantitative than others.  There is, for example, poor correlation between company performance and executive pay, employee layoffs, and corporate restructuring/acquisitions.  <br /> <br />The author draws some of his broadest conclusions from his most qualitative concepts.  For example, he defines the Hedgehog Concept as \\"... an understanding of what you can be the best at [in the whole world].\\"  That's a pretty fuzzy definition, and is ultimately unverifiable.  As a result, the author gets involved in several ad hoc arguments.  For example, on page 99 he berates Upjohn by saying:  <br /> <br />\\"Upjohn never confronted the same brutal reality [that it could not compete with an industry behemoth] and continued to live with the delusion that it could beat Merck.\\" [page 99].   <br /> <br />Yet he lauds Darwin Smith for making a similar gamble, in positioning Kimberly-Clark in competition with Procter & Gamble: <br /> <br />\\"But they reasoned, if Kimberly-Clark thrust itself into the fire of the consumer paper-products industry, world-class competition like Procter & Gamble would force it to achieve greatness or perish.\\"  [page 20]. <br /> <br />The difference between a great Hedgehog Concept and a bad one, apparently, is that the great one works and the others don't.  But with history as our guide there's no end to playing the role of Monday-morning quarter back.  <br /> <br />Part of the Hedgehog concept is tight focus.  But when faced with contrary evidence in the form of G.E., which has lots of conglomerates, the author tries to force the contrary data into his world view by arguing that GE's Hedgehog Concept is to have lots of good managers so they can manage various divisions.  There's never a coherent, global definition of what constitutes a Hedgehog Concept; it's largely tautological reasoning that establishes \\"great\\" Hedgehog Concepts as those used by \\"great\\" companies.   <br /> <br />I must temper that complaint by saying that, in spite of the less-than-rigorous nature of this book, most of what Jim says makes sense to me.  This was a most enjoyable book to read, and I've filled the margins (top, sides, and bottom) with notes and scribbles.  In particular, he gives a nicely balanced view of leadership, cutting through the baloney that's so often the core competency of people who try to write books on the subject.  Here's a typical quotation: <br /> <br />\\"George Ruthmann ... understood that the purpose of bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline...Most companies build their bureaucratic rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people on the bus, which in turn drives away the right people on the bus, which then increases the percentage of wrong people on the bus, which increases the need for more bureaucracy to compensate for incompetence ... and so forth.\\" [page 121] <br /> <br />Overall, I gave this book a high rating because it made me think.  The author has obviously spent an enormous amount of time doing research, and the book really is pretty good.  The high points certainly outweigh the problems, and I highly recommend it - especially the lengthy appendices. <br />

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is the story of a boy named Jonas, who, in his society, is about to go out into the world with his new job and new schedule.  It starts off explaining his life and his home where the world is not set up in a free land but rather in a place perfectly and completely regulated by \\"sameness.\\"  Then, comes the yearly event for the children to grow one year older and this year is the year that Jonas will be given his job and place in the community.  He is given an assignment full of honor and intrigue.  No one knows what it truly is and so Jonas starts off on his adventure.  This is a boy who has always grown up following orders and doing exactly as he's told and then, through his job he is suddenly shown a way for things to be otherwise, a world where things were not always \\"sameness.\\"  This novel is many different things all put together and I do suppose you'd have to talk to the author to know exactly which idea they truly were trying to express, but overall, this is an examination of our society and how people all wish for things that might not be as wonderful as they may sound to be.  This story's moral that hit me the most was that which says that with the good comes the bad and the thought that even if one is so wretched that you might not think you can survive, it's still worth the wonder that you have in exchange.

0767834739|4.0|Let me start out by saying the only reason I watched this film is because of Milla Jovovich. (Alice) Period. Ever since I seen her in \\"The Fifth Element\\" she is now on my must see list. Brains, brawn and beauty are her traits that cannot be matched. But now that I see Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine) I might have to rethink my reasoning.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil-Apocalypse\\" continues on the path of the popular video game genre. This film is the second in the series of Resident Evils. The always-curious Umbrella Corporation must open the Hive! Of course this leads to unleashing the T-virus again. Raccoon City is built above the Hive, so the virus spreads faster than oil in water. The Umbrella Corporation cannot stop the virus so the decision is made to quarantine the city and nuke it. But what a better situation to try out their new prototype fighting machine Nemesis.<br /><br />  A rouge group of cops and civilians roam the streets. They are looking for a way out of the city. When they cross paths they decide to join forces with Alice. But wait, the inventor of the T-virus is looking for his daughter. He strikes up a deal with Alice for their freedom if they can find his daughter. This action packed film takes you on a roller coaster ride through the streets of Raccoon City. All hell breaks out killing zombies and devil dogs. If you liked the first Resident Evil film then this film will not disappoint.

It features Mr. Deniro (before he got into comedy) as an American in on a deal to rescue a case for Natascha McElhone, a great and unusual beauty doing a convincing North Irish accent. His partners are internationals, a Swede, a Brit, and a Frenchman (the admirable Jean Reno, who looks like he smells like a wet cigarette). Much danger and excitment quickly follow. It's all the better for it's constant affirmation of its gritty, intelligent, and suddenly violent reality. And even if you don't like car chases, well, you might after you listen to the director's commentary. You'll know as much about cars as the guys on the radio. I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it. It's the work of a very experienced man (Frankenheimer), who feels that understatement, restraint, and timing are the most powerful parts of storytelling. The story is a spy game, post cold-war, so no Bad Russians..oh wait, there are some bad russians. But it's clear that Frankenheimer cares less about the politics and more about the players. In the commentary Frankenheimer talks about not only the function and performance of the actors, but he gives us an inspiring lesson on his technical craft. A magician willing to give away his secrets, a real find. <br />
B0002SROSQ|5.0|This is my first introduction to Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds outside Nick Cave's collaborations with Johnny Cash.  I have to say that I am very glad I took the chance on this album.  It begins with monstrous force and ends with sweet passion.  In between is a journey through many different and novel musical climates.  I love Cannibal's Hymn, the instrumentation and tune is completely new to me.  And the lyrics are original and fresh like listening to a poet instead of rehashed concepts of heartbreak or hard luck, there are completely new ways of phrasing ideas and songs here.  Simply great and it will be a favorite for a long time to come.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Heat is an absolutely top notch crime thriller, with fabulous action scenes, excellent character development, great subplots, and strong performances all around. It is much, much more than a vehicle for De Niro and Pacino, and that's saying quite a lot, because it happens to be a good one at that. With all the testosterone flying about, the wonderful performances by Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Amy Brenneman really shine. The first time I saw it I fell victim to expectations of a De Niro/Pacino scene of epic significance.  Avoid my mistake, and enjoy the film.
B00064MW6K|5.0|Halle Berry is perfect as Catwomen, it's a fictional character, so you have to see the movie knowing that.  It's no different then believing a man can have powers because he was bitten by a spider.  It a great movie to watch because she play's the part of a women who's life was reborn because of cats.  Berry is the best catwomen ever.  Please see it for what it is don't let critics turn this into science afair it's good nature fun and good quality work was done for this movie and some of the lines are of the old Batman, Spiderman comic book novels and so what.  It sticks to what people know of the comic book industry and that's why I like it.  Rent it today and see for yourself.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann is expanding on his own genre of gritty crime dramas with Collateral. Using high definition video, he creates the most realistic vision of L. A. that I have ever seen on screen. Stylistically, everything in the film is toned down to keep it as closely grounded in reality as possible. There is no slow motion, self conscious cinematography or indulgent set pieces. Mann reigns in all of these tricks to keep the audience wrapped in the story. He continues with his recurrent themes of masculinity, professionalism and skill. Cruise and Foxx are exceptional here. Both deliver stand-out performances that are unique in their restraint. While both have ample opportunity to take their characters over the top, they don't. Instead they keep with the whole tone of the film and what you do get is much more rewarding and compelling. Like Mann's other films, he relies on the complexity of the characters to tell the story and not mindless action to fill in where the writing lacks. Mann is not afraid to show you the quiet contemplative moments because he knows they will sharply contrast with the action when it comes. There is nothing overtly exceptional about the story or even the writing, although both are good. The real reward here is in the performances and the brilliant direction of Mann, who achieves even greater success with a more minimal approach.
B0000D96NW|5.0|Next to 'Burn My Eyes' this is there best CD. If you have not heard 'Hellalive' the recording is exceptional for a live LP. Both are ones to purchase.
B000683VI4|5.0|Let's face it, \\"The Notebook\\" is what used to be called a \\"woman's film\\", and these days, \\"a chick flick\\".  It's a romantic tearjerker, based on a book that was... a romantic tearjerker.  With the exception of James Garner and Gena Rowlands it's a well made movie. Let's be honest, there is no way in the world that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams would ever grow old and look like Garner and Rowlands! The best thing about this film is Rachel McAdams.  This young star gives such a luminous performance as Allie, that it's impossible to take your eyes off her whenever she's on the screen.  It's a warm, human and heartfelt portrayal that's so refreshing to watch that you just know this young lady was made for the part.  Ms McAdams has a bright future ahead of her, make no mistake about it.  Ryan Gosling does some of the best brooding captured on film as Noah.  <br />This is not a great film, but it's rescued time and again by the wonderful Rachel McAdams.  Her smile alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Sorry folks, I know the entire plot revolves around Garner, Rowlands and the notebook, but I was satisfied with the 1940's love story told in flashbacks.  High marks also for the period detail, but five solid stars for Rachel McAdams!
B00000IN5G|2.0|Sure, Children of Bodom are better than some other bands, but they just don't come close to most. The guitar is OK, the singing/growling sounds phony (listen to Possessed's album Seven Churches-thats true growling), and TOO MANY F***ING KEYBOARDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />The keyboards truly ruin this band completley, I'm sorry but something about this band just causes me strong dislike for them. <br />Their blend of metal, growling, and keyboards/classical just makes it sound phony and taseless. Also they are NOT black metal, black metal is bands like Darkthrone, Mayhem, Immortal, Dark Funeral, and stuff like that.
B000683VI4|3.0|I've read the book and watched the movie many times, and I must say that I prefer the book overall, in that Sparks's poetic manner of writing leaves the narrative with a more graceful and timeless feel. The movie tries to imitate this feel, but it ends up corny and insincere. However, I must also say that Ryan Gosling never ceases to make the movie enjoyable. His performance was great although I know that he is forced to hold back on his full potential for this role, and he does a great job of embodying every trait of the ideal boyfriend. After watching the movie for the first time, I temporarily became obsessed with Ryan, thinking that maybe in real life he is really like Noah Calhoun. Obviously, it's a total act of stupidity, but I think that's what makes this movie so appealing to girls. Ryan makes every boyfriend look bad! I'm probably not the only one who started wondering why my boyfriend doesn't take me for canoe rides surrounded by ducks or build me a house. I was very impressed by Rachel's courageous performance as well, as this is only her second or third major role. She has a very bold, fiery personality behind her, and I look forward to seeing her in other movies. As for Ryan, I really wish he'd appear on Jay Leno or something so he can get all the love and attention he deserves as the wonderfully mature, talented, and seductive actor that he is.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|HOLY CRAP!!! This movie is freakin' hilarious!!! Okay, I know the kiddies love it, but I am 36 years old and I laughed till it hurt. Everyone who has ever gone to school KNOWS Napoleon. You'll be able to totally relate. There are too many highlights to mention. I wish this movie were 10 hours longer!!!! \\"Napoleon...Don't be jealous that I've been chatting online to babes all day...\\"<br /><br />Signing to the Backstreet Boys \\"Larger Than Life\\".<br /><br />Watch this movie!! Your life is lacking till you do!!!<br /><br />Don't forget to watch the wedding extra to see the hilarious bonus of Napoleon riding a horse. Too much!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|I really like the whole jazz/country thing going on, it suits her interesting voice well. She is a talented musician in every sense, and I commend her work. The only thing i wish for is a little more variety, but mellow works for her.
B00006879E|5.0|Songs about Jane by Maroon 5  is a very interesting album. It has elements of rock, R and B, pop and punk music.  The best song is the Grammy nominated song She Will Be Loved.  This song is a reminder that we all need someone to lean on when things get tough.  I also like the song Through With You.  It is a nice rock song about feeling frustrated with a lover who constantly lets you down.  Sunday Morning is a very smooth song about trying to get back to the person you love.  This Love is another hit on this CD.  It is about the emotional strain it takes to keep a relationship working.  Harder To Breathe is an excellent rock song about feeling suffocated by someone.  This song pumps me up every time I listen to it.  Not Coming Home is another great fast song with excellent guitar licks.  This song is about how people get stronger because of the abuse they endure in relationships.  The Sun is another one of my favorite tracks.  It is about how we can both love and hate a person at the same time.  I think a lot of people can relate to the lyrics on this track.  Songs About Jane is one of the best albums of 2004.  I really enjoyed it.
B000002UAX|5.0|Released in November 1968, this album poignantly captured the mood of the world at the time. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy had just been assassinated, the war in Vietnam was raging, and America was on the verge of major social change. So when the Beatles self-titled double-LP arrived in its plain white packaging, it wasn't a moment too soon.     Never before had a rock record been so schizophrenic. The White Album had silly singalongs, dirge-like ballads, social commentary, love songs, lullabies, and even gospel. And it ran the whole gamut of styles: rock, folk, string-quartet, metal, soul, pop, neo-classical, country, blues, dance, and the avant-garde. But this was truly the Beatles best and most heartfelt recording. There are very few albums like this today. This is well worth the money, and suggested for teens just getting into the group.     KEY TRACKS: While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Happiness Is A Warm Gun, Long Long Long
B000005HLV|5.0|Most people like to bad mouth this album, sayign Attila's vocals are garbage, and Euronymous was a poser, etc. etc., essentially spouting Varg Vikerne's (from Burzum) words about Euronymous.  However, this is an excellent release, and no fan of black metal can do without it.  Mayhem were always much more avante-garde than other BM bands, and that's furthured by Maniac's vocals on later post-Euronymous records.  Always, the vocalist was in some ways odd, and strange, even Dead, anyone who's heard their CBS track or Live in Leipzig knows that Dead was a strange vocalist as well, so don't say silly things like no one compares, or something, he wasn't even the best black metal vocalist.  Attila's vocals are not black metal, they are something totally odd and different, and they fit in perfectly with Mayhem's music, which is odd, creepy and very cold.  Most songs go on like a trance befor the vocals even come in, and when they do they sound like dis-emobided spirits, filled with rage and hatred.  Mayhem's music is not like other black metal bands, and is totally different from other people's music.  There are only a hand full of bands as interesting as this album in black metal, and if you want to hear some more very cool black metal check out Darkthrone (the greatest black metal band), Emperor's first full length, In the Nightside Eclipse, and Burzum.  Other bands like Samael, Immortal, and etc. were very good though, so don't limit yourself.  It all started with Mayhem (second wave BM that is, not first wave which was Venom and Bathory), so don't bad mouth this just cause you think BM should be Dimmu Borgir, or even Immortal, cause this is nothing like most of those bands.
0671027387|4.0|Someone lent me this a few weeks ago, and from the jacket I didn't think it was my kind of book. But once I started it I was hooked.<br /><br />It was a really great read, impossible to put down.<br /><br />However, once the villain is revealed (an excellent surprise) I felt that the book kind of went downhill.<br /><br />Anyway, if NASA really is such a drain and so insecure, something really should be done. I hadn't been aware...
B000002KGT|4.0|so many years later, a very interesting piece of music, in relistening i find the bass line and rhythm sections excellent, and the vocal harmonies to be quite interesting, so what went around came around, and a great production effort amidst the other albums of the late 70s, im most impressed with christines talent, and spent most of last night and this morning enjoying <br /> <br />
B000003TA4|4.0|Yes we can all agree thank God for this record. It came at the perfect time, 80's glitz was dying and something was needed to shake the world up. This album was a great step in the right direction, however where MTV and Vh1 fail to mention is that Soundgardens Badmotorfinger, Pearl Jams Ten, and Alice in Chains Dirt are an equal part of the equation. There is no doubt that this is a great record, just listen to Lithium or On a Plain and youll know you are listening to something special. Cobain wrote great tunes, not a very good guitarist, he didnt have to be though a 5min solo wouldnt fit in a Nirvana song. I was in my teens when this record came so Ill tell you first hand that this album was just one of at least 4 or 5albums that created the grunge scene, and they were all equally as good. <br /> <br />Final Verdict..Good Strong Record, but not the Godly record that magazines and MTV tells you it is.
0670033375|4.0|Collapse is Diamond's examination of those societies that have failed and those that have survived.  He starts out this book with a look at modern day Montana's problems with natural resource decline.  From there he looks at ancient societies, including Anasazi, Vikings on Greenland, Easter Islander, Mayans, etc.).  Later in the book, he covers modern collapses (most notably the Rwandan genocide).  There is much here about environmental disasters but Diamond's thesis is not that these are what destroy societies but human reactions (or lack of reaction) to these disasters.    Aside from the lessons Diamond hopes to impart from the collapses he examines, this is a great book just in the sheer amount of historical and archaeological facts he shares with the reader.  I cannot think of a single book I have read in recent years that provided me with so much new knowledge.  And, added to that, the further readings section is a treasure trove of suggestions if you are particularly interested in any one section of the book.  After I finished, I had a list of twenty-five books I wanted to read as a result of reading this one.    I do feel that this very strength causes the book to be less than effective in its stated goals.  It seems that Diamond tries to cover too much too fast.  Much of his arguments are built on assumptions that it seems he does not take the time to prove.  Plus, I fear many will dismiss this learned and carefully researched book (as much for the title as anything else) as just another environmental screed and not pay any attention to the ideas Diamond puts forth.  In spite of its overly ambitiousness, this is a wonderfully entertaining and educational book that has something very important to say about how we live our lives.
B000001FV9|4.0|'Last Exit' is a curious album from a band that frequently changed its personnel and its sound.  This 1969 release finds in-and-out-again member Dave Mason contributing one track (the opener), and performing on a brief instrumental he co-wrote before scooting out to record his landmark solo effort, 'Alone Together'.  That left Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, and Chris Wood to fill out the remainder of the disc, with a bit of help from producer Jimmy Miller (who first worked with Winwood in the Spencer Davis Group, and co-wrote 'I'm a Man' with him), and producer/arranger Larry Fallon, both of whom receive composing credits on the disc.  <br /> <br />When 'Last Exit' first appeared on vinyl, it was split between a studio side and a live side.  The opener on the studio side was Mason's 'Just For You', which only begins to hint at the more mature sound the singer/guitarist would suddenly project on the epic 'Alone Together' album.  It is, nonetheless, one of his better early Traffic numbers, a somewhat trippy, fast tempoed track, perhaps claiming the first slot due to its pop-song feel and length, running only 2:15.  'Shanghai Noodle Factory' follows as the longest of the studio tracks at 7:58.  It has a biting acoustic guitar, percussion, and melody that will certainly grow on you.  'Something's Got a Hold of My Toe' is a brief instrumental (clocking out at 2:12), another fast-paced track featuring some fine lead guitar work from Mason.  'Withering Tree' is my least favorite among the studio selections, a rather dismal track, originally selected as the b-side for the band's single 'Feelin' Alright'.  Winwood and Miller teamed up to compose the final studio track, and the best song on this collection, 'Medicated Goo' (a reference to a homegrown cure-all).  The song features the same fast-paced sort of lyrics as  Winwood delivered on 'I'm a Man', and comes complete with a catchy guitar riff and chorus as well. <br /> <br />The diverse nature of the genre created by Winwoodand Traffic is perhaps no where better illustrated than the live protion of this disc, recorded at the Fillmore West.  Winwood and company open with the Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley track, 'Feelin' Good', which has been covered by everyone from John Coltrane and Nat King Cole to Bobby Darrin.  It's way to the jazz side of most Traffic fare, but it's a classic tune well-performed.  There are some subdued segments of this ten minute plus tracks that reveal the presence of an audible \\"buzz\\" (not generated by medicated goo), but the relative absence of crowd noise throughout makes for a reasonable trade-off. <br /> <br />The final track, 'Blind Man', possesses a more discernable structure than 'Feelin' Good', but still favors an overt jazz posture.  The song was a collaboration between trumpeter Joe Smith, who made his mark playing with Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland, and Deadric Malone, a psuedonym for songwriter Don Robey.  The two are probably most famous for another collaboration, 'Turn On Your Love Light'.  Both 'Feelin' Good' and 'Blind Man' afford Winwood, Wood, and Capaldi considerable leeway to display their acumen on organ, flute, and percussion respectively, and both songs warrant more than a single listen. <br /> <br />'Last Exit' is the balk in Traffic's catalog, earning its name from the belief that the band was disbanding.  While their best works ('Low Spark...' most notably) still lay in wait, 'Last Exit' affords us yet another snapshot of the band in the midst of their seemingly endless metamorphosis.  My AAD copy is pretty much devoid of any meaningful liner notes or photographs, so if you buy it, you buy it for the music, and that's not a bad buy.  Certainly a must for Traffic junkies, and a satisfying curiousity item for the rest. <br /> <br />
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Hey, I can't really top the superlatives that have already been bestowed upon this masterpiece, but I would like to address nearly all of the one-star posters comments. <br /> <br />People have claimed that the only reason this album recieves any adulation is because of Dylan's reputation- WHAT A CROCK! <br /> <br />All of the music Dylan has produced in the past ten years is superior to just about anything in the canon of popular music. <br /> <br />His grammys and acadamy award are well deserved. I heard \\"Things Have Changed\\" on the radio, not because I bought it. I was entirely blown away by the song, not because of the artist, but because of the recording. IT JUST ROCKS! How can anyone hear a track like that and not flip out over it? I'll never understand it. You just can't please some people no matter what you do- that's my only explenation. <br /> <br />\\"Love And Theft\\" is just more of the same. So quit arguing this reputation theory- it's pointless. Dylan's made plenty of albums that are just manure, and his rep. didn't do anything to change the fact.  <br /> <br />It just so happens that people enjoy this stuff, we may be in the minority, but it's the quality of the work we're attracted to, not Dylan's mystique. <br /> <br />Oh, and to the person who said something along the lines of, \\"Dylan is going to end up just like Tom Waits\\": I wish a lot more artists would!!!
031286504X|4.0|Matheson said, \\"... when I lived in New York, I watched Dracula, the old Lugosi Dracula, at a motion picture theater, and it just occurred to me that if one vampire was frightening, then a whole world of vampires would really be frightening.\\"  _I Am Legend_ is about a hard-drinking family man, Robert Neville, apparently the last living human being -- everyone else has been turned into vampires by 'bacillus vampiris' after an atomic or biological war, who lives in a house fortified against the nightly onslaughts of an army of the undead, including his next-door neighbor-ghoul, Ben Cortman, who keeps yelling, \\"Come out, Neville!\\"  The suspenseful creepiness begins with the first sentence of the book:  \\"On those cloudy days, Robert Neville was never sure when sunset came, and sometimes they were in the streets before he could get back.\\"  You just know that eventually he is not going to make it back inside his house in time.  The first half of the tale describes Neville's mundane existence:  eating, drinking, listening to classical music, hanging garlic bulbs on his outside walls, driving stakes into vampires during the day, going to the library to read about bacterial diseases, etc.  In the second half, things happen -- Matheson had to come up with an ending, but like most horror stories, the conclusion is not as satisfying as you might wish.  Ten short stories are also included in this book, including most notably \\"Prey\\" about a doll that comes to life and attacks a woman in her apartment, and \\"Person to Person\\" about a man who receives telephone calls in his head from maybe (?) his subconscious.  Matheson is an imaginative genius; Google him and see his long list of writing accomplishments and the many movies made from them.  _I Am Legend_ was first published in 1954, long before derivative works like Romero's Night of the Living Dead and the Resident Evil video games and movie.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|First of all, I can't complain enough about all of the PG-13 \\"scary\\" movies coming out. Even Wes Craven's new flick has been slated PG-13. It almost sickens me. Even if Saw was completely horrible, which it isn't, it would still get points in my book for at least being R. Saw proves to be a great reminder of why scary movies need to be R.<br /><br />Saw is an uncomfortable psychological thriller that follows in the footsteps of David Fincher. Think of the savagery and bloodiness of Seven with the atmosphere and puzzlement of The Game. Saw is extremely well-paced, has some great visiual (often disturbing) imagery, and has an awesome ending you won't see coming for a thousand miles. And I can't stress the fact that it is rated R enough. What more do you want?
B000000OQF|5.0|I've listened to this album last night. I've listened to all tracks. I've liked several songs on this great album. And what I <br />think is that this is GNR's greatest album of all time. You know <br />that my advice for this album is Dire Straits's 'On Every Street'. The best songs on this album were 'Welcome to the Jungle', 'It's So Easy', 'Nightrain', 'Mr. Brownstone', 'Paradise <br />City' 'Sweet Child O' Mine' & 'Rocket Queen'. Let's preview all <br />the tracks now of this great album. <br /> <br />1. Welcome to the Jungle: Great opening song with a great heavy <br />metal style. Axl makes you laugh in this track when he sings shananananan knees knees or seprentine!! One of the best. 98/100 <br /> <br />2. It's So Easy: This track is also good but this is a track I'd <br />always skip after a while. 85/100 <br /> <br />3. Nightrain: One of heavy metal favorites, it's good but another <br />track I'd skip after a while because it gets boring fast. 92/100 <br /> <br />4. Out Ta Get Me: I didn't really like this song. This song was <br />talking about Axl gettin away from the cop because he's innocent. <br />One other thing is that the vocals have bad words in it. 69/100 <br /> <br />5. Mr. Brownstone: This track is marginally better. I also like <br />this track a lot on this album. It's funny and is great guitar <br />works by Slash. One of the albums best. I even putted this one <br />on my new compilation, \\"November Rain-The Very Best of Guns N Roses\\". One of my favorites. 97/100 <br /> <br />6. Paradise City: This song is another great awesome song. The <br />guitar work by Slash is really cool. The vocals by Axl are hard <br />to understand but the beginning is really great. One of my favorite songs on this album. 100/100 <br /> <br />7. My Michelle: This track to me was ugly, Axl is mad in this track. It seems to be more of a back in black type song than an <br />Appetite song. 23/100 <br /> <br />8. Think About You: This was marginally better. Turning into a love song. 83/100 <br /> <br />9. Sweet Child O' Mine: What can I say, this is the greatest song <br />GN'R ever did. The solo is so great and the vocals by Axl are perfect. This is my favorite song on this album, ever. And is one <br />of my all time favorite songs next to Heavy Fuel, and Coyote. <br />Great song!! 150/100 <br /> <br />10. You're Crazy: This track was not good, this track had bad words and axl screamin. Who cares about this track? 23/100 <br /> <br />11. Anything Goes: At first this song has sex. But it was okay. <br />The others seem better. 70/100 <br /> <br />12. Rocket Queen: This song rocks so hard, great closing track <br />it's the second longest to Paradise City. It's one of the greatest gnr closers of all time. 96/100 <br /> <br />Great album. You Need This Album. <br />Go out and buy it.
B0001XAPX8|2.0|Robert Benton's \\"The Human Stain\\" is a well-intentioned, ambitious but ultimately deeply flawed film.  It does a masterful job of passing for a profound, Oscar-caliber film.  So masterful, in fact, that for long stretches of time you don't notice that it's simply not working. <br /> <br />It boasts an incredible A-list cast including Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris, it does indeed boast some Oscar-worthy performances.  I was especially impressed by Kidman's complete transformation into a somewhat-less-than-classy janitor.  In addition to the tour-de-force cast, there's Benton's artsy direction style and the even-artsier cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier's beautiful work.  Escoffier died shortly after filming wrapped and the film is dedicated in his memory.  And thene there's the esteemed Rachel Portman's beautifully composed score.  And then there's the source material which was adapted from the brilliantly complex novel by Philip Roth. <br /> <br />However, these glittering pieces never fit together into a movie that's worthy of its prestigious pedigree.  It seems unfair, then, that all of that talent and expertise has resulted in a film that, while beautifully crafted, is so emotionally detached, remote, and confused by itself.  I haven't read Roth's novel, but I suspect that screenwriter Nicholas Meyer, in his attempt to get all the main characters and events from the book onto the screen, had to leave a lot of connective material behind. That material, whatever it may be, may have seemed less important to Meyer, but without it the parts of Roth's story just drift, disconnected, in their own peculiar orbits. <br /> <br />Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a college professor who loses his job over a supposedly racist remark.  The irony of this charge forms the base theme for the story. Silk's comment is innocent because of \\"the big secret\\" he has hidden for many years.  After resigning from the college where he had worked for years, he beginsan affair with Faunia Farley, played by Kidman.  She has her own emotional baggage and is unable to commit to the relationship with Coleman.  The affair, however, revitalizes Silk and he is finally able to confront some of his past demons. <br /> <br />Just about the time all these conflicts are coming to a head, the whole story comes to a crashing halt. There is an extended epilogue. The movie staggers on for about 20 more minutes, but the story has been decapitated, and has nowhere to go. The ending is anti-climactic in the most extreme sense of the word.  <br /> <br />The storyline is periodically (and annoyingly) interrupted by extended flashbacks of Coleman as a young man in 1944 New York.  It's in these scenes that we learn \\"the big secret\\" that Coleman has spent his life concealing.  This is the hidden core of the film.  And it ends up being the ultimate failing of the film. The flashbacks work fine on their own merits, but they don't feel connected at all to the rest of the film. The flashback scenes, and the secret they contain, seem to have no impact on the later scenes. If somebody told me that Hopkins was never even told by Benton what went on in the flashblacks, I wouldn't be a bit surprised. <br /> <br />Kidman, meanwhile, takes a good many risks, playing not just seductive but lowbrow to considerable effect; her character, however, is never fully explored, and a few of her scenes are bizarrely unexplained (especially one in which she talks to a caged crow in a campus classroom, which comes out of nowhere and makes very little sense).
0670033375|4.0|The first part of \\"Collapse\\" is a fascinating look backwards to discover why some famous civilizations have disappeared from the earth (i.e., Easter Island, the Mayans, European Greenland, etc.).  Jared Diamond tells it like a detective story, using remarkable forensic evidence to learn, for example, how the diet of the residents of Easter Island declined over time (by counting the various kinds of animal bones they left in their garbage).  There's all sort of neat stuff here - I learned what \\"dendrochronology\\" is, for example (the science of telling the age of a building from counting the rings of the trees it was constructed from).  Diamond observes that the interconnections and specialization of civilizations can cause them to fail - Island B cuts down all its trees, so it can't make oceangoing canoes anymore, so it can't trade sharp stones with Island A, so Island A is no longer capable of making effective tools. <br /> <br />The second part is interesting but not as convincing:  Diamond tries to discover what distinguishes successful civilizations from those that failed in Part I.  In this part, the stories are interesting but the reasoning seems random:  Diamond argues that the European colony in Greenland collapsed because it was hierarchical and tightly controlled by its leaders (so it could not adapt to changing circumstances); but he also argues that Tokugawa Japan succeeded because the central shogunate kept tight control over ever tree in the country (i.e., it was hierarchical and tightly controlled). <br /> <br />In the third part, Diamond tries to work out why societies make bad decisions that cause them to fail by mismanaging their ecology.  This part is the least effective of the book.  Although he takes a stab at describing the dynamics of group decision-making, this is not Diamond's strength.  In the end, his prediction is optimistic (about Australia) or pessimistic (about China) based on his own instincts.  Diamond's instincts are better than mine, surely, but less compelling than the scientific evidence he puts behind his argument in the first third of the book. <br />
B0006U4UAU|5.0|It's official. LCD Soundsystem is 2005's best album, as of February 16, and, although it won't be bought by most for its dance tracks, is possibly the best dance record to come out of the USA since 1979. <br /> <br />If you could pick out one track -- any track -- from this eponymous album, as separate from the record as a whole, you might be able to define the genre, detemine influences, and draw comparisons to a reasonably similar band. But to do so would be entirely unfair to a record which, by its nature is entirely unique, disperse yet unified in vision, and destined to become a classic. <br /> <br />The overall feel of this eclectic album is of indie vocals over very well sequenced rhythms that alternate between vintage 80's, and the best of indie 2004 (the best single year for indie music ever, in my humble opinion). Some tracks are layered with rich experimental guitars, while others let the clever, often spoken but never boring lyrics take the lead. But just when you've got LCD Soundsystem (aka New York producer James Murphy, now co-head of red-hot label/production duo DFA) figured out as Talking Heads meets Cabaret Voltaire meets late model Bowie, as might have been produced and recorded by Factory Records circa 1980, you get thrown for a loop by a track like the perfect \\"Movement\\", an almost too-short track which stands out as the best of the record, and whose screeching guitars over industrial bass line and cymbal heavy drums are the rock high point of the record. This energetic plateau leads perfectly into the brilliant, mellow \\"Never as Tired as When I'm Waking Up\\", a track that could easily have been taken directly from Elbow's Cast of Thousands, but which seems to work so much better here as part of what turns out to be an incredible compilation of style. The record's closer, \\"Great Release\\" is quite comparable to the best you might hear from Moby. <br /> <br />Then you get to disc 2. <br /> <br />That's right. This record, which as a single disc wasalready brilliant, is a two disc set, for a single album price. That is: it's a two disc set unless you buy on iTunes (don't do this -- do yourself a favor and get the entire two disc record and the six additional tracks). <br /> <br />Disc 2 is even more danceable than disc 1 (which is no small feat). Concentrating more on rhythm, lyrics and soundscape than on hook and radio sellability, the second half of LCD Soundsystem takes off with the classic club anthem \\"Losing My Edge\\", which cleverly sounds off many of Murphy's most important influences, and announces, quite accurately, \\"We all know what you really want\\". This is followed by the standard club fare \\"Beat Connection\\" and then the groovy \\"Give it Up\\", which sees the Cramps meeting the Pixies. \\"Tired\\" is a thrash guitar celebration and the two versions of \\"Yeah\\" are pure modern disco bliss, 70's bassline and all. The second of these is an instrumental triumph of epic proportion. <br /> <br />If I sound excessively excited and annoyingly enthusiastic for this record, it's because I am. By the way, Daft Punk is always playing at my house.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is great. Its strength comes from the fact that it is not simply leveling its anger at 9/11 politics and Bush, but it is digging deep into disposable suburban trash culture, isolated and apathetic to the horrors around it. Green Day is raging against the loss of feeling in themselves and the world around them. American literature (Richard Yates, Arthur Miller, Norman Mailer) has been doing this for years, its about time r'n'r stepped into the breach and bashed the dead and decaying consumer culture of TV and Fast Food that we can't seem to get enough of. Green Day has been gorging themselves on it just like everyone else, and they're here to say enough! They Don't Care if We Don't Care! This album is bigger than liberalism vs. conservatism, it deals with how happy you can be with the place you live and call home, and Green Day aren't that happy in the America of today. Neither am I, but I'm a little bit happier after hearing this.
B000002G7E|5.0|Although the first Velvet Underground album was considered somewhat unnerving, WHITE LIGHT, WHITE HEAT certainly represents the band at their most abrasive.  If you don't prefer your rock and roll fuzzy, gritty, and wildly experimental, please be advised not to bother with this one.  Consisting of six tracks, most of which are exploding with primal intensity, the Velvets opened up the music world to new possibilities of sonic damage.      Throughout, the band pound out their patented brand of dirty mutant rhythm and blues with wildly deranged lyrics to boot.  Songs often begin in a groove of sorts, only to self-destruct into wild episodes of squalling guitar and feedback.  You can virtually hear the instruments screaming for mercy as tunes like \\"White Light/White Heat\\" and \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" screech to a halt.  And \\"Sister Ray\\"....... Wow! Nothing can quite prepare you for this album-closing fiasco.  Lou Reed was surely hopped up when he led the band through this 17 and-a-half minute train wreck of musical chaos.  Not so much an album as a full out assault on the senses, WHITE LIGHT/WHITE HEAT is one helluva listen and one great slab of pure unapologetic rock n'roll.
B00005QDW5|5.0|One of the real definitive \\"Best Of\\" collections of this colossal bands history. This is not only a great collection of tracks but its also arranged and mixed to move you along a journey as you listen. If you consider yourself a Pink Floyd fan, you can not do without this 2 CD treasure. If you've not had the pleasure of hearing Pink Floyd, here's your best chance. Hats off the remastering team on this one.
B0002OERI0|2.0|Im not seeing the revolution here.  Generally, this is the same stuff.  Not as much of it, but still... THE SAME.  Theres a few minor changes, really, i mean GEESE.  Their single, Bouelavard of Broken Dreams, is one example of something different.  OK, just ok, thats all it is.  And it gets tiring after being played as much as every other blink 182 type pop-punk wonder.  This litterely boars me.  Music is not meant to boar.  Music is not meant 2 b the same exact power chords played over and over.  This is not energy or \\"punk rock\\" its unoriginality.  The dope'll only crate songs for you for so long.  Go find something with some spark 2 listen 2.

B000002C1W|5.0|Some critics and Floyd purists have knocked this album for a number of reasons.  Though Water's departure is evident, as the songs are nor nearly as droll and ironic as before, the song writing is still inspired.  To assume that Water's absence would ruin the band is to underestimate the ability of the remaining members.  The music is different, though, but Pink Floyd has a history of drastic musical changes.  With each new band line up, the music paradigm shifts.  The  eerie Pink Floyd of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" bares little resemblance to the band that released the whimsical and psychedelic \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\"  The key to appreciating this album is to avoid the temptation to hold it up to older, Water's era Floyd as a measuring tool.  Instead, listen for the emergence of Gilmour, Mason and Wright's input, the change of tone of the lyrical content, and the development of the production process.   <br />--But some things never change.  Gilmour's guitar tone is still, if not more so now then ever, bluesy and bell-like, and the sound is sincere, the lyrics thoughtful and engaged, and the rhythm driving.
B000000JO3|5.0|This is the best early 80's punk album ever. i have been listing to Minor Threat for about 14 years and it still does'nt get old to tell the kid who knows nothing about punk or hardcore, i would like to say that to give this cd one star is outrageous. the band Thrice or whatever he is talking about sucks. and if you were to call them emo maybe you need a history lesson. Emo- music that is highly emotional and full of heart pounding energy. ok to be litteral all music is. but as a style of music, i dont think you know who your doging kid. Ian MacKaye #1 Teen Idols D.C. #2 Minor Threat #3 Embrace (the godfathers of emo) #4 Fugazi ( at the fourfront of emo to this vary day). This man has influence just about every thing in the punk, emo, hardcore sene to this vary day. so just think about it....and flex your head.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|There were a few cute moments in this movie to be fair.  The dance at the end (which was a bit cheesy, but cool and sweet also since he was helping out his friend).  For the most part however, this movie was a complete waste of time.  Keep in mind that I'm someone who would kill to star in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie and count Empire of the Sun and Magnolia as two of my favorite ever movies, right alongside The Shawshank Redemption.  I also have six DVD's of the best of Beavis and Butthead also and the Collector's Edition of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, so you can't say that I don't appreciate dead-pan comedy.  But those works still have some art and love in them and perfect delivery combined with actual PLOTS and PUNCHLINES.  This movie was just plain dry almost all the way through.  The one-liners were lame and monotonous.  There was no plot or point to this whole movie.  You can see that I need to appreciate on a subtle level, which there was none of.  Or maybe I'm just looking for some actual action, drama, or comedy.  I don't know about you, but that's certainly what I watch movies for.  I think the only real reason that this movie was successful was because it was promoted by MTV, yet was so different from what they usually promote.  Hell, if you want good comedy from MTV, watch Orange County.  This was just sad however.  Save your money and go see The Aviator or Ray instead.

B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Michael Jackson is one of the world's greatest superstars. His talent is beyond imaginary. Many people may criticize Michael for putting out too many records with the same songs on it. For example HIStory: Past present and future, was 2 disc compilation. Disc one was a greatest hits cd. In 2001 he re-released that first disc and in 2003, he release Number Ones. However the ULTIMATE COLLECTION BOX SET is DEFINETELY worth your money even though some songs are re-released. However you also get many songs which have NEVER been released as well as songs with different versions. P.Y.T., Dangerous, and Who Is It are just some of those examples. New songs such as The Way You Love me and We've Had Enough, just to name are few, are some of my favourites on this box set. What makes this even more worth your money is the LIVE DVD concert that comes with it. This 2hr concert was once broadcasted around the world and it was one of the greatest concert productions EVER in the world. This FULLY LOADED concert is so amazing, i watched it 3 times IN A ROW! Yes, it is THAT good. I'm pretty sure all you Michael Jackson fans already own this, but for those of you who are not big fans of Michael, GET IT! It contains great music and a great live performace.

B00005OAIE|5.0|This is an amazing CD. John Mayer's music helped me through a really tough period in my life. This album has such great songs, catchy enough to sing along to, but also mellow enough to calm down with. I disagree with anyone who bashes his lyrics-John is an amazing songwriter, and doesn't music seem better if it comes from the heart? I like the fact that we're getting a little bit of John Mayer's soul through his lyrics. <br />I heard John play years ago in a coffeehouse in Boston while he was at Berkely, and I've loved him ever since. I strongly suggest \\"Great Indoors\\", \\"Love Song for No One\\", \\"3x5\\" and \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\"
B000683VI4|4.0|Described, as a \\"sleeper\\" hit , of 2004 , \\" The Notebook \\" , comes up, nothing short, of it's high reviews.  With over twenty years, of films that glorify violence, addictions , and sex....it's hard to be taken in, by a film that detracts from the common themes , in today's cinema. Initially , this film starts out as sweet as a gallon of Chocolate chip, icecream. However , the characters , become more complex and the film gains a hefty amount of substance , by the second act. Seemingly, going from 1st shift , to high gear , and before long , you'll be transfixed. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams give great perfomances ( as young Noah and Allie )....but it's the subtle and searing, performances of James Garner and Gena Rowlands ( as the old Noah and Allie ), that make this film memorable. Without the latter actors , I don't think this film would've reached the level of critical success that it has.They simply take the film into a higher plateu. Nick Cassavetes , does a phenominal job , of directing a story about an elderly couple  , who are very much in love. Unfortunately, Alzheimer's  , is slowly erasing the memories , from the wife ( Rowlands ). Therefore , the husband ( Garner ) reaquaints himself with her , periodically , and uses hand written memoirs , of their life together ( Notebook )  , to bring her back to him. As you would expect , there's alot of cheesy sentimentality. But this film's honest approach to telling a simple love story, shines through the modern themes, of today's films. However ,due to some explicit sex scenes, parental guidance is strongly suggested. Finally : by simply , staying the course , \\"The Notebook\\" , manages to surpass some of the \\" Blockbuster\\" films, of last year. Personally , by the end of the film , I simply wanted to embrace my loved one. More than likely , you will , too. The dvd offers a steady supply of extras and the commentary by the director is very interesting. Even more so , after watching the film , in it's uninterupted entirety.d entirety.
B00062IVKI|5.0|I've always loved this film. Uncompromising, grandly experimental, and maybe ahead of its time. With the new DVD, time has now caught up to \\"New York, New York\\" and it reveals a remarkable achievement. Perfect? No. Rather, it's a grand gamble fusing improvisation and old time movie musicals together for a sometimes raw, but always emotional journey. The movie examines several things at once. It shows the evolution of the American movie musical from MGM's \\"Let's Put On a Show\\" entertainments to Warner's (and others) more personal, character driven musical showcases (e.g. A Star is Born). The movie also follows the evolution of jazz from communal Big Band to solo experimental forms such as Bebop. I love how the principal characters in \\"New York, New York\\" start out as familiar musical comedy archetypes, but soon evolve into flesh and blood people juxtaposed against the artificiality of the musical form. What a great idea. Other than her work in \\"Cabaret\\", Minnelli has never been better. DeNiro is great and Scorsese pulls off scenes and musical numbers that honor and stand alongside Hollywood's best. The first fifteen minutes of this movie are a knockout for anyone that loves cinema. Yes, the movie is long. A little slow. But it's great discovery for those who have never seen it, and a treasure for those few that know the movie well. One added bonus is seeing Clarence Clemmons of Springsteen's \\"E-Street\\" band in his first (and only?) movie.

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Troy is probably the best movie of 2004, which is saying a lot, considering 2004 was a superb year for movies making such soon-to-be classics like Sky Captain, National Treasure, Van Helsing, and Phantom Of The Opera. Troy is a thundering action epic, perhaps even better than Return Of The King. Brad Pitt stars as the hulking action star Achilles, while Eric Bana plays the Trojan prince Hector. Orlando Bloom also has a supporting role as Paris, Hector's younger brother who starts the legendary war in the first place. The swordfight betwixt Achilles and Hecotr is perhaps the best in any movie, and is definitely worth checking out. If you are looking for the greatest swords-n-sandals epic ever made, seek no further. Troy is the ultimate.
B000009ROK|3.0|I am a very big fan of boleros in general, and especially 50's and 60's boleros. Even though I am young, I can apreciate these things. Luis Miguel is a good artist. His voice is very nice, and he has a master of the music in Armando Manzanero, THE GREATEST SONGWRITER in the history of the bolero. As a Puertorican, I grew up with my grandparents music. Even so, his music is excellent. However, the best interpreters of all this music are the following artists and groups, which LM has managed to copy in some ways, Trio Los Panchos, Los Tres Ases, Los Tres Diamantes, Los Tres Reyes, Felipe Pirela, Bobby Capo, Jose Luis Monero,Vicentico Valdes, Carlos Gardel and the master, Lucho Gatica. Those are the real singers. LM is important, not for the quality of his music, slthough it is very good, but for the more important job of spreading this music. All in all, however, he is definetly NOT the greatest artist alive, much less the best of all time.
B00000JLWW|4.0|James cameron's Titanic is everything you would want in a movie, and is the most successful movie ever, but it could have easily been the best film ever, save one downer. The film opens in modern day, with some scientists going down to the Titanic wreckage to find some treasure. They show the foul-mouthed scientists finding a drawing down there, then bringing in an ancient woman who the picture is of. The woman, of course, is Rose, a survivor of the legendary shipwreck. Then Rose proceeds to tell them of how the picture was drawn, and we are transported to the 1912 world of the greatest epic ever. Now, if the movie had opened where the flashback had opened, this would easily be the greatest film ever. However, the first thirty minutes showing modern day are spoiling, and it takes away a lot of the epic grandeur. If the film had closed with Rose arriving in new York in the pouring rain, then that would be perfect. But then, after the flashback is over, Cameron shows us the old woman dreaming and throwing jewels into the ocean..what? Anyway, if the modern-day scenes were excluded, Titanic would be king of all movies. But because these scenes were added, i knocked a star off my review rating, and other movies surpass it in quality. Also, i thought the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio was a bad move, and if i had been Cameron, i would have cast somebody like Antonio Banderas.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is what going to the movies is all about. The movie production is lush, sensual and down right sexy! Gerry Butler brought a new depth to the character of the Phantom that I did not see in the stage production. His voice is not as trained as Michael Crawford, but who cares. He brought a harder edge to his vocals and it was perfect for the role he played. Emmy Rossum was a wonderful young Christine and Patrick Wilson played the perfect \\"boy next door\\" who falls in love with  Christine. Buy, rent or see the movie and I promise you will enjoy the fantasy and beauty of the Phantom Of The Opera.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I love this movie to Phantom of the Opera. It's such a wonderful movie for the Phantom!!  I can't wait for it to be released on dvd on May 3rd!!!  I'm ready to Surrender to the Music of the Night when I get to see it on DVD! <br /> <br />The whole cast is great on it.. I thought Gerard Butler was a really good Phantom. His acting was a whole lot better than his singing was. <br /> <br />I adored Patrick Wilson as Raoul!!  :)    He has such a lovely voice!!
B0002IU988|3.0|I found this cd to be watered down and plain for the most part. Yes there are some hot licks but I don't hear anything that says \\"wow, you need to check these guys out\\". I'm not looking for Creed I just don't think these guys deliver anything I haven't heard a million times before. A few cuts are very good but a bit more originality and a bit less generic nu metal would be nice for my tastes.
1401200923|3.0|Hush vol. 2 collects the second half of Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee's 12 issue Hush storyline which features basically every major Batman villian...ever...a mysterious new villian named Hush is manipulating all of Batman's old villians.  Batman is nearly killed in the first part and is nursed back to health by a doctor who was a childhood friend, Dr. Thomas Elliot.<br /><br />There are plenty of plot-twists as Batman tries to unravel the mysteries of Hush.  In fact there are a bit too many plot twists which seem to be thrown out to beef up what could have been a rather simple plot.  If Hush really wanted Batman dead there certainly was ample opportunity.  If the villain wants simply to inflict a grievous defeat on Batman, and he knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman, why not destroy him simply by revealing this to the world?<br /><br />The revealing of Hush was anti-climactic to say the list.  Guessing the identity would not take a master detective.  If I could figure it out then certaintly Batman should have a LONG time before that.  We know that Jim Lee always wanted to work on Batman. It would seem that he also always wanted to draw every notable Batman villian...whether they were central to the plot or just brought in for a cameo as many of them were.  So what we get is some beautifully rendered fight scenes as Batman battles the various villians, held together by an angel hair plot.  Unfortunately this is what happens when a popular artist is given too much power.  It's the mistake Marvel made in the 90's when they turned over their major characters to the hot artists of the day like Lee, Liefeld, McFarlane, and others.  Hush vol. 2 has a bit more substance, but not by much.

1400043662|5.0|I just recently discovered Murakami and haven't yet read through all of his works (I find it significant that most reviewers Have), so I'm not going to compare this to his other books, but I think this novel is fantastic.  It is marvelously intricate, I love the way time doesn't quite overlap in the two parallel narratives, and the characters are so fantastic.  I was describing the plot to a friend, and she said it sounded very Stephen Kingish, (because of one of the main characters being mentally handicapped and the the grotesqueness of the Johhny Walker-types in the book) but unlike King, Murakami is just so quotable and literate. <br />I could really go on forever about what I love about this book, the fuzzy relationship between self and other, an apocalyptic leech storm, a truck driver's first trip to a library (another thing I love- like Kafka, I live and work in a public library that used to be a house).  I love it, too, when Nakata strikes up a conversation with a cat, and the cat inevitably replies, \\"You can talk?\\" Brilliant.

076790592X|4.0|What is life? How do we definite a life? That's a complicate and difficult question for answer. Mitch Albom has a good experience with great teacher \\"Morrie\\".  <br /> <br />Like this axiom makes me realize something in my mind; \\"So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.\\" <br /> <br />I knew this is a common sense. But if I realize something from like this tiny book, it works for me. When I mind my own business in routine life, I sometimes lose a point. What motive makes me going to do? What is my life goal? Sometimes I feel my life is similar to labyrinths. Whoever realize burden of life, it's a good experience to look back a meaning of life.     <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Save yourself some time and money, and never watch this movie. I love movies, watch them all the time, and am open to any type. I especially like comedies, and have a great sense of humor. I was told be numerous people that this movie was great, so decided to watch it one night. That was one of the longest nights of my life. The movie has absolutely no plot, and although some would argue the one-liners make up for it, in no way did they manage to even keep me awake for more than a few minutes during the movie. The jokes sound funny taken individually, but when combined with the lack of plot completely devoid of humor, anyone laughing would have to be trying to blend in with a crowd. If you absolutely must watch this movie, it's best watched with a group who can make fun of Napolean with you and possibly keep you awake for most of the time. To sum it all up, the only reason I gave this movie even one star is because it was the minimum choice.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic- <br />For many the name is synonimous with the greates grossing film of all time. To others like me, it will be a memento of times gone by, and first love. Titanic is not Gone With The Wind. It has its own identity and place in history. Cameron is a great director capable of communicating a simple love story across into our own time. James Horner's score is haunting in all it's beauty. Kate Winslet's Rose is a portrayal to be admired, she is Rose. Her acting and her sensibility bring a certain nobleness and romance to her character. Leonardo di Caprio, reminds one of how good it's to be young and reckless and take risks. While Rose's mom brings us the reality of a changing society and old customs. This movie is a masterpiece and it should be admired for its sincerity and realism. And not for what it missed.

B00003CXXP|5.0|Like many great directors, Speilburg's versatility contues to amaze. Not content to break box-office records and bring home the horrors of the battlefield, Speilburg decided to finish a project long left unfinished that he had collaborated on with the controversial genius Stanley Kubrick. The result, while far from popular with mainsteam moviegoers, is a landmark science-ficiton fillmsure to be remembered long after the blockbusters of the moment have faded from memory.<br /><br />This film is about many things. It is about people who are becoming more like animals, and machines who are becoming more like human beings. It is about technology, obsolescence, and the stagnation and ruin an ideology of convenience and leisure inevitably leads to. But most of all, this is a story about a boy who is a machine and yet dreams of becoming \\"a real boy\\". David, played to perfection by Haley Joel Osment (perhaps the greatest child actor in history), goes through an incredible spiritual journey in his personal quest to become what he feels he must in order to win the love a human mother. At first quite an awekward \\"mecha\\", once the magic words to make him bond with a human are spoken, David finds himself victim to the unconditional love that a child feels for it's parent; a love that can never be switched off. As a result of this programming (and what is love if not instinct, and instinct if not programming?), and David's rivalry with the son he was once meant to replace, David becomes our eyes into a vision of the future, a world where the mechanical show more kindness and compassion thaqn their creators (the kindness of a french-maid mecha facing her demise had tears welling up in my eyes), and the unwanted almost-human are tortured, hunted down and executed for public spectacle (in perhaps the most disturbing part of the film).<br /><br />Really, David's joruney is a metaphor for the story of Pinnochio, but also a metaphor for the journey that every human being must go through in their life and search for happiness. While some might dislike te ending of this film, I found it enjoyable and immensely profound. Like the rest of this picuture, the final scenes call to mind more questions than they answer.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, questions came flooding to my mind. What is the differnce between programming and instinct? What is love really? If emotional look real, are they real? And perhaps the greatest question, (which concludes this mind-trip of a film) if love feels real, does it matter whether or not it is an illusion?

B000067FP8|3.0|I wasn't overly fussed about watching this in the first place, but thought I'd better to stop the brewing argument about to take place between my boyfriend & me. (I promise, I'll watch Indiana Jones sometime).<br /><br />I couldn't really remember much about the original, except that I loved Gizmo, and I hated the other Gremlins. They seemed to get even uglier in this movie, except for that giggling one, he was cute. But he was just a giggly Gizmo really.<br /><br />There are two different versions of this movie, and that's the theatrical version, and the one for 'video'. The difference is that in the theatrical version, it appears that the film begins to burn, however, in the video version, this segment is replaced by a segment which simulates a broken VCR machine. This is a really funny bit in the movie, cos I honestly thought the DVD had gone a bit loopy! And then Hulk Hogan appears - whatever happened to him?!<br /><br />There are loads of references & spoofs, and stuff relating to the first movie. When one of the gremlins gets injected with the bat serum and becomes a bat, it breaks through the window and forms in the broken glass the logo for Batman, another Warner Bros. release. The dentist gremlin, who seriously freaked me out, says \\"Is it safe?\\", a reference to Marathon Man. Leonard Maltin is attacked by Gremlins for panning the 1984 movie. An obvious reference to The Wizard of Oz: one gremlin is dressed as the Wicked Witch of the West, melting, saying, \\"I'm melting! What a world! What a world!\\" The scene where Kate tells the story of encountering the flasher dressed as Abrahahm Lincoln on Lincoln's birthday was intended as a parody of a scene in Gremlins where she tells Billy about her father's accidental death one Christmas. The character Daniel Clamp, obviously based on real-life real estate tycoon Donald Trump, falls for Billy's manager, Marla Bloodstone, at the end of the movie. Donald Trump was married to Marla Maples. Joe Dante had originally planned for this movie to spoof its predecessor, and elements of this \\"spoof\\" are displayed throughout the movie (ie, Kate's monologue, the gremlins being less threatening and more funny, etc) One of the offices in Clamp Towers next to the Splice of Life was \\"Vectorscope Labs\\" from the movie Innerspace also directed by Joe Dante. Aside from Mohawk, the other three Mogwai created from Gizmo are called George, Lenny, and Daffy (the first two referring to John Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men, the latter referring to Daffy Duck).<br /><br />Joe Dante being the Looney Tunes mad Joe Dante, there is obviously the references to the Looney Tunes, and also, they feature at the start & end of the movie. During the end credits, Daffy Duck walks onto the screen and comments on the names in the credits, saying things like \\"Long, isn't it?\\" \\"You're still here? Don't you people have homes?\\" Normally, we don't watch through the credits on DVDs, just at the cinema, but I understood it eventually, when Daffy kept popping up. At the beginning of the film, Bugs Bunny appears on top of the Warner<br />Brothers Logo as in a Looney Tune Cartoon. At the very end of the film after the credits, Porkey Pig tries to say \\"That's All Folks\\", but gets interrupted by Daffy.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say this movie isn't much better than the original, but then again, sequels rarely are, save a few. I enjoyed both, but they're just not that great. They're not mind-blowing, or anything, just harmless fun. Just don't make me watch Critters?

B0006A9FMI|2.0|The very fact that the movie was only in Japanese language discouraged me from going any further than the first word in the movie. The movie also subtitles varies noises in the movie such as a helicopter approaching and background chatter of common civilians. I'll give this movie two stars just for the fact that I can't stand to watch movies that can only be viewed with subtitles and no English language, as well as the subtitling of various background noises.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Are they over the top? Yeah. Are their vocals screamy and melodramatic? Certainly. Are the lyrics alternately cool and corny? Sure. <br /> <br />But look at those song titles. They're selling an illusion. You need to listen to this album like you're going to watch a movie--a midnight showing of a popcorn flick that nevertheless rumbles with style and unnecessary action sequences. It's not reality, but it's not a fashion show either. It's entertainment. <br /> <br />To some people, this means it's crap. I don't believe that. Listen to the energy in this album! Crank it up! If you can't burn up the nighttime highways with this music, you're too old to be listening to rock. <br /> <br />My Chemical Romance have produced a fun record, full of irony and mocking and vented frustration and Hollywood goth costuming. The songs roar and they're catchy as hell. Don't think. Just rock.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|Now that you've had your fill of misguided second rate reviews read this one.<br /><br />Short and sweet. Van Helsing is a great spin on the classic vampire tale with some amazing special effects. The actors really turn out some great results, and the plot is terrfic.<br /><br />There is one flaw and depending on which side of the fence you are on, it may or may not be a big deal. The ending. I found it to be a bit dissapointing. Actually, it was lame. It subracted from an otherwise amazing movie.<br /><br />Overall assessment? Buy the movie. It takes a lot of creative license with a classic tail. For those who are whining that you can't mess with the original storylines may I remind you, the original story, Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", was fiction, not history.
B00001OH82|1.0|This album just seems to last forever; it drags along like there's no end to it. It's one of the few Bowie albums I really can't enjoy in any way whatsoever. It suffers heavily from the lack of good songs and the amount of guitars. There IS such a thing as too much guitars, especially when the songs aren't any good to begin with.
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This is definitely a five-star film for me. It's a lot of fun and I know a lot of people who really enjoy it. I've even been able to convince some of my friends to watch it a few times, and got them into writing Fan Fiction for the movie. The movie is very colorful and has some great characters.Sarah and Jareth, are the main two characters. They work well with each other. Both characters have flaws and really harmonize well in that sense.<br /><br />David Bowie is great as King Jareth and Jennifer Connelly is good too. I love all of the funky costumes for Jareth and the puppets created by Jim Henson.  Henson does a great job directing this movie.  It's really good for kids because they get to learn about friendships and having to grow up. It's good for anyone though, really, because it's so creatively vibrant and wild creative.
B00001OH7X|4.0|Lodger is far more uplifting than it's precessors Low and \\"Heroes\\", and toys with worldly influences instead of with dark and broody instrumentals. Those influences work well, though it's no Graceland. At times the album doesn't sound as inspired as Low and most of \\"Heroes\\" does, and it lacks real standout tracks, but as a whole it's a very fun and fairly good album. Worth listening to any day.
B000002RXS|5.0|This Carmen has become a classic, its only rival in that aspect being the supreme recording with Victoria de los Angeles and Nicolai Gedda. Now what is it about this Carmen? Callas was no longer the dramatic coloratura soprano she used to be from 1948 to 1959 at the time this was recorded (1964). Her voice rested in the middle now and what a middle this is! Dark, fiery, passionate and bursting with colours. She brings Carmen to life, not as a slu**y little twit (As some have portrayed Carmen) but as a fascinating human being. Listen to her seductive Habanera and Segeduilla! These are worth buying this by themselves! Nicolai Gedda is in top-form and sounds magnificent as Don Jos, though not as fresh as on the recording with de los Angeles. Pretre conducts vividly, the rest of the cast is magnificent, them being very underrated French performers. (Esp. Guiot) Two thumbs up!
B00001OH7Y|5.0|The way this album opens says it all: Bowie screaming at the top of his lungs, and with that sounding like a deranged version of himself suffering from a major mental breakdown. In the complete opposite direction comes Robert Fripp's guitar, shredding his way through what's left of the song. Somewhere in the middle both come crashing into each other, somehow melting into It's no game (pt1), the opening track of Scary Monsters. As he did on \\"Heroes\\", guitarist Robert Fripp leaves a significant mark on the songs he plays on. And a beautifull mark it is. Bowie sounds terribly inspired too on this one, the crown jewel being Ashes to Ashes, my all time favourite Bowie song. There's a good handfull of gems on Scary Monsters, and the only letdown are the last three tracks. One of them being a superfluous version of It's no game, the other two being songs that drag along a bit. But it takes more than three tracks to spoil things; Scary monsters is one of the best Bowie albums!
B0002HTZJI|4.0|If you want a good live CD of anything that pretty much rocks, by all means get this.   <br />If you want a seminal Red Hot Chili Peppers live recording, then don't -- get one of their live DVDs instead.   <br />If you're just looking for the best of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, get Blood Sugar Sex Magik. <br /> <br />More details: <br />I do really like this CD.  I don't like it because it is a stunning performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers; rather, I like it because the Red Hot Chili Peppers sound pretty stunning no matter what they do. <br /> <br />The songs are all very well executed - I think you'll be hard-pressed to find tighter and more creative live musicianship than what these four guys produce.  There's a lot of energy throughout the show, and I think a fairly good mix of songs and moods. <br /> <br />BUT...there are a few things that keep this at four stars only. <br /> <br />1 - production feels a bit rushed (this was released something like a month and a half after the concerts, so clearly there was pressure to squeeze out the CD).  Vocals aren't loud enough (but then again, having been at the June 25 Hyde Park concert, that was the case live as well).  The guitar is so saturated that it tends to get fuzzy and drowns out the other instruments -- even the sound John Frusciante's pick connecting with a string gives a loud \\"ka-crunch\\".   <br /> <br />2 - I can see why some reviewers think this is a lacklustre performance.  John's solos, while strong, are nowhere near the fantastic melodies he is capable of producing (see the Slane Castle DVD for example).  Songs like \\"Zephyr\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\" lose some shine because of that.  Even Flea's short solo bursts aren't as inspired as what I had come to expect, and feel a bit like they're on autopilot.  Doesn't quite gel. <br /> <br />3 - Anthony's vocals, despite being mixed too low, are a bit flat.  He just sounds tired a lot of the time.   <br /> <br />4 - And yes, the setlist could be better.  Only two songs from BSSM, that's not very satisfying.  So there's a Donna Summer falsetto cover...so what? <br /> <br />So in conclusion, by the standards of any live CD, this is very good.  However, the band sound a bit absent-minded throughout, not as fierce as usual -- and let's face it, this music needs to be played fiercely, otherwise it tends to fall apart a bit.
B00011V8CW|1.0|I don't like BTWN at all. It's got lots of covers, and apart from \\"Jump they say\\" and \\"I know it's gonna happen some day\\", all songs sound the same. They're even of the same length. They just don't build up to something. They lack some sort of climax. I find it very hard to sit through the whole album. And all the extra's you get with this expanded edition just make things worse; more boredom is what they bring.
038073186X|3.0|I have to admit, this was a page-turner, but I expected more. By the end, I was rather confused and, when I finished, I felt as if there should have been more to the story. Otherwise, I think it was a great idea and it wasn't one where you can guess what is going to happen before you get to the end.<br />Also, he didn't proofread it very well. There was one very long run-on sentence that was rather annoying. Not a very big deal, but still annoying.
B00000ILDF|3.0|I hated this film when I first saw it - after the gung-ho and mass alien slaughter of the previous film it was hard I think to get worked up about a single alien, plus of course to generate real suspense you need to have some sort of empathy with the characters whose lives are on the line. In short, I felt that the rich legacy of the alien series had been sold short(mind you, have you seen Alien vrs Predator!). But having reluctantly revisited the film recently I've got to say that perhaps I was a bit too quick to dismiss it. Admittedly, it's still a pretty bleak and grim film, and I don't think my girlfriend would thank me if I popped it into the DVD player as we snuggled down one saturday night, but there is much in here to be admired.Have a look at the other reviews is you want a plot synopsis. <br />At times I struggled to see where all the extra footage of the extended version has been spliced in, however,the different take on Ripley's death is in my opinion is the most obvious, and it has to be said, the most satisfying. In the theatrical version the alien bursts from Ripley's chest just as she's about to disappear into the furnace. This makes it pretty clear that she would've died regardless of whether she'd taken up the offer to have the alien surgucally removed or not. Whereas in the extended version, and in what is very much the ultimate culmination of so much religious imagery, Ripley sacrifices her life so that mankind can live - there is no alien exploding from her chest - in effect she still has the choice between life and death, and it can't get any clearer than the crucifix posture she assumes as she disappears into the flames. For me it underpins everything else that is alluded to, either in word or imagery, throughout the entire film and as such it makes watching the film a far more rewarding experience. I don't know why they weren't brave enough to go with this in the theatrical release.
0440237688|5.0|Ever wonder what life would be like without color?  Not just colors as a painter would put on a palette, blues, yellows, purples, and reds, but those colors which give depth and purpose to life, like hope, family, choices, and love.  In Lowry's world of \\"Sameness,\\" the reader is confronted with an unsettling and even frightening sense of familiarity with this strange world which exists without any sort of color.  Following Jonas, a boy of twelve, Lowry explores the fundamental questions surrounding the importance of life, choices, and individuality.  While it is categorized as a young adults' book, its themes and characters speak to all generations.  Through the memories of a life \\"back and back and back\\" in time, Jonas and the Giver gain the wisdom and strength to make a choice that will change everything they have ever known.  Through Lowry's colorful, energetic, depth of language, the reader is drawn into Jonas' world and forced to remember with him what life really means. <br />Personally, I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter what age, race, or creed.  It is a story all can relate to and one that forces us to take a step back and take another look at life.  If you enjoyed the movie \\"Pleasantville\\" you will love The Giver.  By addressing these things in a children's book, Lowry deftly introduces these fundamental and extremely important ideas of life to those who will one day have the power to change the world.  Beautifully crafted and poignant, The Giver is without a doubt a little masterpiece of emotion and art.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a big fan of Joss Whedon.  I'll watch just about anything he's involved in at least once. However, my love of this show has little to do with the fact that it's Joss. <br /> <br />The simplest description of this show is that is basically a Space Western/Cowboy movie.  But the characters are so real and dynamic and complicated that you can't help but love every one of them.  There's big-time mystery (what did the Alliance do to River? who is Shepard Book really?).  There's romantic tension that you half hope will be resolved and half hope it won't be because it's so fun to watch.  There's humor and there's drama.  There's plenty of action and good old western style gunfights.  This show pretty much has it all.  There's one liners that'll make you die laughing.  There's insightful dialogue here, too.  The main hero of the piece is complex and dark and not really trying to be a hero at all. <br /> <br />Pick up the DVD set and treat yourself to some backstory before the Serenity movie comes out.  Even if you watched while it was on the air, this set has some shows that FOX never aired in the US and there are some nifty special features and behind the scenes stuff.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|Well let;s be honest, It was not the most original idea for television ever.  I get annoyed by all the loud and vocal supporters online of the show's creator work thinking that he can do no wrong.  I say \\"GET A LIFE WILL YOU?!\\".  The man is not a genius or indestructable, he's just as likely to make a good or bad TV show or film just like anyone else in Hollywood can.  I certainly was able to find out that the Fox studio was keen on getting this show cancelled which they did without a second thought and told the creator to leave the building by 5;00. So in a sense he was fired.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|Pitch Black was a movie I didn't see until after it came out on DVD. I had no idea what I was missing. <br /> <br />I'm a firm believer that there's not much new under the sun, and I will admit it's true of this movie as well. It owes a lot to movies like Aliens and Predator - movies that gave us scary creatures that inhabit the shadows and, while not evil, are the enemy simply because they are higher on their personal food chain than we are. <br /> <br />I found the use of color important in this movie - much of it looks washed out and monochromatic, but on a planet with three suns blazing overhead, what wouldn't be sun-bleached and sand-blasted into nothingness? <br /> <br />And Riddick... I was so pleased with this character. Generally, when Hollywood writes the \\"anti-hero\\", he's a one-note character. The outsider who does things by his own rules but is generally good-hearted. He's not bad, he's misunderstood. By the end of the film, he's redeemed because everyone suddenly realizes that life doesn't follow rules and gee, maybe he was right all along. <br /> <br />Not so with Riddick. Riddick is a convict and a murderer. He has no compunction against letting other people do the work or in leaving them behind if they can't pull their own weight. If he has to choose between saving your neck and his own, you best have your will written because you aren't getting out alive. He loves mind-games and he loves using his reputation to his advantage. He's not dumb and lucky, but neither is he some \\"evil genius\\" who manages to know how to do everything. <br /> <br />Does he get redeemed? Oh come on, this is Hollywood. Of course he does, but thankfully, his \\"redemption\\" is not complete. He wouldn't be Riddick otherwise. <br /> <br />This is one to watch in the dark, especially with friends. Once things in the movie get dark, they stay that way.
B00006879E|4.0|I think that this production is one of the best released in 2004 and it's still going very strong. After \\"HARDER TO BREATHE\\" that made it to #18 on Billboard's Hot 100 plus \\"THIS LOVE\\" and \\"SHE WILL BE LOVED\\" that both peaked at #5 (also on Billboard's Hot 100). Now they just won the 2004 Best new artist Grammy and their fourth single \\"SUNDAY MORNING\\" is also climbing the charts.   This guys have a great talent while performing and writing their own songs. I would find it very difficult if I have to compare this group with another because is very unique. If you don't know very much about their music. It's a mixture of rock with pop.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not usually a fan of sci-fi, but I found the characters so likable and interesting that it didn't seem to matter that they were flying around in a spaceship.  Joss Whedon and crew really delivered.  Too bad there is only one season to watch.
B0006SSOHM|3.0|Oh, what this movie could have been.  I don't think the directing or acting was that bad.  But the script was too generic.  A little research was needed.  Let me explain:<br /><br />#1. A doctor would never say he had been electrocuted because he knows what the word means!  It means you are dead.  The average person does say that when they are shocked; doctors NEVER do, ever.<br /><br />#2. Why would the good doctor use the saw (removing...well, I don't want to give anything away)when he could have used his shirt to reach the cell phone on the floor?<br /><br />#3.  The twist of the movie is not really a twist at all.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it doesn't hold up as being a \\"Wow, I never would have guessed that?\\" movie - if that is really what the author was shooting for.  The viewer was not given enough information to make the shock value come out.<br /><br />#4.  The detectives would have discussed the \\"other\\" evidence in the case: hundreds of feet of razor-wire, timing devices, the safe, the candles, etc.  Why did none of this material lead them to a purchase location?  This needed to be explained, because there has never been a killer, in the history of killers, who has left so much material behind.  He had to buy or steal this stuff from some place.  And some of the material was so unique, like the contraption he strapped to the one woman's head, that they would have to be able to trace the origins.<br /><br />#5  I was sickened by another film where a person who has just been terrorized by an EVIL person doesn't pull the trigger when the tables turn.  I've seen thirty years of that ridiculous scenario.  When will Hollywood learn how dumb that is.  I would have shot the guy in the forehead until his brains became artwork on the carpet.<br /><br />Okay, all that said, the movie did have some good acting and some really creepy scenes.  It is disgustingly horrific and a little interesting.  The film could have been so much more with a little more thought and research put into the script.  Ya can't blame this one on the acting.<br /><br />See ya next review.ittle more thought and research put into the script.  Ya can't blame this one on the acting. <br /> <br />See ya next review.
B00005JKGO|3.0|Like L'Avventura, when I watch La Dolce Vita, I fall asleep faster than you can say, \\"Where is that Bunuel DVD?\\"  Even Ozu's Tokyo Story seems like Rambo/Terminator edge of your seat action bonanzas compared to these two Italian \\"masterpieces\\".  Antonioni's film is a bit more cerebral whereas Fellini's is whimsical.  In all seriousness, La Dolce Vita is well made, well acted, and contains some glorious filmaking such as the scene when soft Italian newspaper reporter and platinum blond actress first dance and then she is swept off her feet by a fellow mutant actor that looks like a cartoonish devil.  Perhaps I was just tired and it was late at night when I watched these two Italian films; and the commentaries, although informative, are somewhat soporific.
B000683VI4|5.0|Rachel McAdams and James Garner turn have the most amazing performances of their careers in The Notebook.<br /><br />I loved Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls.  I love her even more in this film.  Her character experiences such a wide range of emotions throughout this story, I was amazed at how well she met the challenge of being extremely convincing scene after scene.  I did not like the sex scenes though - I simply think they were a little long, and had they been a lot more subtle, this could have been a great kids' movie too.<br /><br />James Garner is COMPLETELY convincing in his role as \\"Duke\\".  This is his best performance EVER!  I have never been a fan of James Garner in the past; I am now!  I was hanging on every word he spoke, every gesture he made.  He absolutely NAILED this role.  I am heading to the video store today to see if I have missed any of Garner's past movies.  I never realized what a great actor he is.  Way to go, Mr. Garner.  I couldn't imagine anyone else in this role.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the fact that it really builds up the romance between Noah and Allie before moving into the \\"here comes the trouble\\" part of the film.  This makes the viewer care about what happens to the characters.  I have seen other films that fail to do this very thing.<br /><br />The Notebook made me realize how much we take for granted our relationships with others.  Noah and Allie spend the summer together and fall in love, but they never discuss or realize the difficulties in the courtship that lie just around the corner; \\"the moment\\" blinded them to reality.  Once the problems began, it was interesting and entertaining to see how the two handled the difficult situation.<br /><br />There are a lot of great performances in this film.  I would like to have seen on actor replaced: David Thornton failed to convince me he deserved to play the role of Allie's father.  I would have liked to see a different actor in that role.<br /><br />The Notebook is a good film, but I wouldn't let children under sixteen see this film.  The sex scenes are a little too serious.  Other than that one item, this is a movie that really delivers the goods.  I believe most people will enjoy it.<br /><br />Once again, way to go James Garner! I won't soon forget your role as \\"Duke\\"!/>The Notebook is a good film, but I wouldn't let children under sixteen see this film.  The sex scenes are a little too serious.

B000002U82|5.0|One of the landmark albums. A definite must-have. The best songs are 'Time', 'Money, 'The Great Gig In The Sky' and 'Brain Damage'. A masterpiece in the truest sense of word.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When this show was first aired I was there, every night. I watched and taped every airing. I wore out those tapes due to Firefly's untimely demise, but was thrilled, in a bittersweet way, to learn of it's coming to DVD. I've watched the series countless times, and I enjoy it more and more with each viewing. The acting is phenomenal. The direction is on par with, and often better than, full length feature films. The writing is peerless. I love this DVD set and I would trade it for nothing except a machine that can transport me to an alternate reality where poo flinging FOX executives didn't cancel this brilliant, BRILLIANT show.
0689835604|5.0|It's a great and fun way to teach your kids about their body parts.  I got this for my son when he was just 14 months.  He's now 18 months and still love the book.  He always get excited whenever I showed him the books.  He would right away sit on the loveseat and would even leave a space for me to sit at.  He's very fascinated with the flaps.  He just can't wait for the next page to come so he could see under the flaps.  There's always a lot of giggles and smiles on his face on every turn of the page.  We both love this.  This is one of the first set of books I bought for him.  I also purchased Toes, Ears and Nose, Where is Mommy, and Daddy & Me, which are equally entertaining and educational.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus.... where to start. These gentlemen are and have always been, without a doubt some of the best artist in their respective area. Each contributes a different talent, which can compare to anyone making music today. One listen to fungus amungus will show you that even at the age of 15 these boys knew their way around music better than most can ever claim All of the albums put out by incubus have their own respective place and each new step forward has been as amazing as the last. Morning View, in my opinion is the eye of the incubus storm. Every band has a time when they reach their musical peak. When each member fits so well with each other and the music they are making is no longer just notes but actual art filled with emotion and precision. In all honesty I feel like Incubus is one of the only bands I heave ever heard to actually be able to reach this on each album attempt, but Morning View has its own special feel. This album is filled with wisdom, insight and music, which is timeless. It seems that these boys just stepped back from the revolution they were preaching on Make Yourself and in doing so found themselves lost in a mess of beautiful music expressing some of the most powerful ideas of transcendence and obvious truths you could hope to find. Leaving all their musical and personal inhibitions behind these 5 amazing musicians stepped from their positions as n metal ringleader and showed the world how much they really were capable of. Brandon's lyrics and vocal range on this album offer the listener enough to keep this CD in any player for years. Mike's guitar is most often found meshed with Alex's bass in a constant flow of compliment. As with earlier albums much of this album was written put together by Alex and his bass work, which often goes unnoticed do to its perfect fit to every rhythm, is some of the most spectacular I have ever found. The drum work is very uniform to incubus's style and as always is very well written and executed. The turntable effects on this album have evolved from the rap feel of science. On this album it is actually hard to distinguish between Mike's experimental guitar effects and the spin of the DJ, which is where I feel it belongs. <br /> I personally feel very strongly that this album was incubus's crowning achievement and could very well fall among the greatest ever written. Don't get me wrong the previous efforts of this band stand right along side this but as with any great artist; that which came before only leads to a new level of expression. This album just happened to be the climax. With the new addition of Ben to the group and the release of \\"A Crow Left of the Murder\\"(which was still better than most album released in 2004) I think that the pinnacle reached on MV was jumbled in the translation, but if you have heard the new material from both that album and the Halo 2 soundtrack you know that Incubus is on the verge of another orgasmic explosion. Can't wait to see where they take us next. <br />
020530902X|4.0|There's a faction (which includes some very good writers) that thinks \\"Elements of Style\\" promotes drab, utilitarian prose. And no doubt there are some rigid, talentless people who make a fetish out of its advice. Maybe the peremptory tone adopted in the first section (largely written by Will Strunk Jr) encourages such a mindset, but most of the book, especially the parts written by E. B. White, contains intelligent advice presented with good humor. Practicing what they preach about the virtues of brevity, the authors cram a lot of useful advice into a few pages. And most of that advice is sorely needed. I don't know how many undergrad papers I've read in which the writer just couldn't make his point clear. That's why I assign this book to my freshman English Comp students. It's a tonic. After several weeks of doing exercises derived from \\"Elements\\" (and from Joseph M. Williams's \\"Style\\"), my students show remarkable improvement: the deadwood disappears from their prose, and clarity emerges from what used to be a confused jumble.<br /><br />\\"Elements\\" isn't a panacea, of course. It needs to be supplemented with books on grammar, logic, and rhetoric. And it certainly won't turn your average student into another Annie Dillard. But I'm continually impressed with how effective the \\"little book\\" is.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon has now perfected his art.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|I placed my order well in advance of the release date and had heard the sample on [...] I expected the whole  <br />CD to be a bit of pop styled jazz similar to the sample which is the beginning of Part 1. Well, the CD arrived and I did an initial listening and frankly was disappointed that it seemed rather chaotic. I shelved the CD for a couple of weeks and during that time developed a curosity for the music I only heard once. Typical of other PMG releases one time through tells you nothing. In fact with San Lorenzo, released in 1978, each listening reveals something else. And that is what TWU has done. I popped it back into the player over the weekend have been hooked the same way I was when I heard San Lorenzo for the first time, The music weaves  a wonderful polyrythmic journey of textures that centers on the melody of the sampler. I have been a PMG fan for over 20 years and own everything but Song X and this release it THE BEST of the bunch. Concert in Seattle on Feb 27!
B00008PW2D|4.0|This season was great and had many hilarious moments.  While it is a little over-priced, it is still worth it.  Don't miss it and don't listen to the naysayers...it's great!
B0002I831S|2.0|Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? <br /> <br /> As a TOS fan I had to get season 1, it's the best season of a great old show, but I won't be buying season 2 or 3.  The price of the set is about twice the normal price for one season of a TV show.  Given the price and the cult status of Star Trek, I'd hoped to see lots of extras.  Instead it was a pretty skimpy transfer to DVD IMHO. <br /> <br /> Only 4 episodes (counting Managerie as 2) have optional text trivia tracks.  How hard would it have been to include them on all the episodes?  Given how much this syndication has been milked by all involved over the years, you'd think somebody involved would have volunteered to to an audio commentary track or two.  I guess they were too busy pursuing their writing and singing careers.   <br /> <br />  The plastic case is original, but not very convenient.   <br /> <br />  For some reason, the episodes have a tendency to default to closed captioning.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen many renditions of Phantom Of the Opera throughout the years and without a doubt this one is the most beautifully Haunting.  The music was amazing.  Andrew Lloyd Webber did a great job putting the movie to music.  Gerard Butler is dashing as the Phantom, Emmy Rossum was stunning as Christine, what a voice!, Patrick Wilson was great as Christines childhood sweetheart and gallant rescuer Raoul.  Minnie Driver added a bit of comic relief as the ever arrogant and conceited \\"Diva\\" Carlotta. This movie had a little bit of something for everyone.  Great Music, Haunting Set designs, Beautiful costumes, Dashing sword fighting, and that Chandelier!...I could go on an on....  I have three teenage (macho) sons and they loved the film!  They talked their friends into seeing it and now I have a bunch of High School \\"Phantom Junkies\\" on my hands.  The last time we went to see it I had 9 High School boys with me anxious to see it.  Seriously it is really great to see teenagers appreciating the cultural experience of this movie.  I highly recommend seeing it.  It's just a shame that it wasn't nominated for more academy awards!  I hope you love the film as much as we did.... : )
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I happen to be a mature movie-goer, but I totally disagree with the critics. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA was truly the greatest movie I have ever seen. Purely amazing in every way, haunting and very heartbreaking. The movie will leave you in tears for at least 3 parts of the movie. PHANTOM was purely spectacular. Why the critics say this movie is poor is beyond me. I have seen this 4 times and I am still not sick of it. Truly brilliant, artistic, and haunting.....this film is, in my eyes, a true marvel that towers over the rest.
B00000255F|5.0|This album,Bruce Springsteen's third,drove him to superstardom. His first two,GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK,released in 1972 and the second one,released the following year,did not have great sales records prior to the release of this one. After this album came out,Springsteen appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and Newsweek,simultaneously. While on tour and about to perform in Memphis,he attempted to go to Graceland to visit his idol Elvis Presley(Elvis was alive then). Security guards escorted him off the Graceland property,without concern that Springsteen was now a major star. Now for the songs:THUNDER ROAD and the title track were hits and later appeared on 1995's GREATEST HITS. TENTH AVENUE FREEZE-OUT was a Top 20 hit also but did not make it to the compilation. The other songs are good. A live version of TR would be recorded in October 1975 at Los Angeles' Roxy for LIVE 1975-85,a 5 LP set released in 1986(that album is currently available on a 3 CD set). For one reason or another,Springsteen would stay out of the studio for three years. Probably because he thought he wouldn't make it as a major recording artist. Nobody knew in 1975 that Springsteen would become one of the biggest-selling pop/rock artists of all-time and later be nicknamed \\"The Boss\\".
B0000AYJXR|3.0|When I saw this at the cinema all those years ago I was very disappointed. The real stars were playing second-banana to a sports personality, the characters weren't really acting like themselves and the plot was pretty predictable. <br />I only bought this DVD because Looney Tunes : Back in Action gave me a wish to revisit and I'm quite glad I did. <br />Although I still wish that the toons were made more of, I now have Back in Action to make up for that. The toon's characters are still pretty far from their classic versions but it works in the context of the film and isn't that bad. I like Lola Bunny who has only seemed to have surfaced on the odd piece of merchandise ever since - I think she deserves a fully paid membership into the Looney Tunes gang. The plot is still predictable but it is also fun. <br />I was surprised to see that although Michael Jordan can't really act, he has enough personality and presense to carry his parts of the movie and the script has some excellent gags although they are few and far between ('What kind of Mickey Mouse organisation calls their team The Ducks?'). <br />As you may note, I am from Great Britain and I was very disappointed to see the amount of extras on the region one version of this DVD that we in region 2 haven't got.  Not for us a commentary or the 4 recently produced shorts (two of which I've never seen). All we get is the trailer, the very poor Jammin' doc (made at the time and total fluff) and the Bugs vs. Daffy TV special that is great but of very poor picture and sound quality - no clean-up here! It's tempting to buy the region 1 version just for 'Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers' and 'Another Froggy Evening' - maybe they'll turn up on the next excellent Looney Tunes DVD compilation. <br />This film is definately worth a visit if you are a Jordan or basketball fan. If you're a Looney Tune fan - visit this film via Back in Action.
B000001FMC|5.0|Swing Out Sister are probably the only British R&B musicians in the world. They were influenced by the late Marvin Gaye and other artists who recorded for the Detroit-based Motown label. If you listen to SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD from 1997's SHAPES AND PATTERNS and AM I THE SAME GIRL? from 1992,you could hear the MG sound. The first hit from this album is BREAKOUT which has great saxophones. TWILIGHT WORLD,the only other hit(at least in the USA) is pretty cool. Many of these songs were written by SOS members Corinne Drewery and Andy Connell. Drewery is the lead vocalist and Connell is the keyboardist.
B0006SSOHM|4.0|If you're looking for a good scare this is the movie you should see. After sitting through a couple of disappointing horror movies (darkness, white noise), I was pleased to finally find a good scare. The acting isn't the greatest, but I think the ending was twisted! Some instances of good camera work.
B0000025D0|5.0|Here is Bruce Springsteen's second hit album,but overall,his fourth. The success of BORN TO RUN,released in 1975,is what monetarily got Springsteen plenty of studio time for this album. BADLANDS is the only song that would make it to the 1995 GREATEST HITS compilation. PROVE IT ALL NIGHT and ADAM RAISED A CAIN were hits also. There would also be live versions of some of these songs on LIVE 1975-85,released in '86. The other songs are very good. Springsteen's next album,THE RIVER,released in 1980,two years after this one,would be his first #1 album. Springsteen's subsequent #1 albums include 1984's BORN IN THE U.S.A. and 1987's TUNNEL OF LOVE.
B0000V46KY|5.0|Jim Hall's Concierto was arguably the greatest LP in the history of Creed Taylor's CTI label. Painstakingly re-mastered from the original analog tapes, this historic jazz album sounds better than ever on this MFSL Hybrid SACD! Guitar genius Jim Hall is perfectly complemented by Ron Carter, Paul Desmond, Chet Baker, Sir Roland Hanna, and Steve Gadd. Hall's fluid, melodic guitar playing is the star of this Rudy Van Gelder-engineered record. Jim Hall is a master of improvisation who values minimalism over flurries of notes. The rich, warm tone of his guitar will flood your senses with musicality. The centerpiece of this recording is Hall's interpretation of Rodrigo's \\"Concierto de Aranjuez\\", which contains what many consider to be Chet Baker's most lyrical, emotional playing.
B0000025T6|4.0|This album spawned only one hit,ATLANTIC CITY,which would appear on 1995's GREATEST HITS. It's a ballad about the New Jersey town famous for its boardwalk,casinos and nearby hotels. \\"Put your makeup on,fix your hair up pretty,and meet me tonight in Atantic City.\\",are sample lyrics from the song. Unbelievably,this album flopped just after the abundant success of 1980's THE RIVER. But the follow-up BORN IN THE U.S.A.,released in '84,would be an even bigger success than THE RIVER. TUNNEL OF LOVE followed in 1987 and would become a #1 album also.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album kicks ASS!!!!!!!   I love it. I haven't heard any of their other ones, but this one still kicks ass! All the songs have awesome beats to them and they are really cool. They are all worth listening to. \\"Chop Suey\\", \\"Bounce\\", \\"Toxicity\\", \\"Prison Song\\", and \\"Aerials\\" are my favorites. Well  all the songs are my favorites, but I pretty much like these the best! I suggest this be the first album of theirs to get! You will totally enjoy this cd! Who wouldn't??? I don't think I have anything else to say about this album, other than it's a must for any System of A Down fan!! And it kicks some major ASS!!!
B000002BFL|4.0|This follow-up to the 1992 simultaneous releases of HUMAN TOUCH and LUCKY TOWN does not have the hard-rocking sound of Bruce Springsteen's longtime supporters,the E Street Band on it. All tracks were recorded in a subtle fashion. We still hear the drumming of Max Weinberg,who at this time was already dividing his time between the E Street Band and the infamous band that plays on Conan O'Brien's late night NBC show. Springsteen didn't even get any support from his wife Patti Scialfa,who worked as a background vocalist for him for many years(Springsteen was married to his first wife actress Julianne Phillips when he first met Scialfa). The songs on this album are telltale ballads such as YOUNGSTOWN,SINALOA COWBOYS,HIGHWAY 29,GALVESTON BAY,STRAIGHT TIME and MY BEST WAS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH. The other songs are good. Springsteen,who normally is no trashmouth,says on MBWNGE,\\"The early bird always catches the f---ing worm.\\". This album's no #1 like THE RIVER,BORN IN THE U.S.A. and TUNNEL OF LOVE. Despite that,Springsteen remains one of the biggest-selling artists of all-time. The same applies to his Columbia Records labelmate Billy Joel.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This album is totally awesome. The cover is cool too, along with the other pics in the booklet. The songs on here are totally cool. Especially \\"Last Day on Earth\\", \\"I Don't Like The Drugs, But The Drugs Like Me\\", and \\" The Dope Show\\". There are some other cool songs, but I think these are some of the best on this cd. Plus, the music videos are awesome!! Don't think it's a sick or stupid album just because of the cover. It's a totally awesome album despite the cover! This cd is one of my favorites. The songs all have a good beat to them. And they kick ASS!!
068987474X|5.0|This book will save lives.  Literally.  It is written in an easy to read format, lots of good humor, sensible advice, very down to earth.  It's like sitting down for a serious chat with the big brother a lot of us women needed but never had. <br /> <br />And if a woman follows the advice, even just the advice in the first few chapters, she will greatly lower the odds of becoming trapped in any sort of abusive relationship - physically abusive or emotionally abusive.  Yes, the authors do cover the abusive relationship in the last chapter, but you don't have to read even that far for sound advice on how to avoid such unhappiness. <br /> <br />And it's *much* easier to have fun on the dating scene if you know how to tell the diff between a guy who really just wants to have a good time that day and one who's in love with *you*.
B000002MP2|5.0|This CD, since it's come out in 1994, has sold about 7.7 million copies. American Idiot hasn't even sold that much yet. Dookie has a lot of hits. Longview, Welcome to Paradise, Basketcase, and When I Come Around are only some of the hits on Dookie. I'm not saying that the rest of the songs suck, because they rock just as hard. By the way, after you listen to F.O.D, wait a few minutes and there is a Secreat song. Buy! Buy! Buy! American Idiot would go awesome with Dookie.
B000002UAU|5.0|First off, I'd take into account Strawberry Fields Forever, Only a Northern Song, Penny Lane, and the still unreleased \\"Carnival of Light\\" as being part of this period.  <br /> <br />The album, released in 1967, took rock and roll to another level, one of critical acceptance, that this wasn't just a fad.  <br /> <br />It won Grammys for album of the year, album cover, and engineering.  <br /> <br />The question is how the music holds up, and the answer is that some of it's grown dated, but for the most part it's still good to listen to, and when you listen to their other CDs, this one stands apart mostly because you hear things on there that you didn't hear as much on Beatle albums prior...weird exotic instruments (not just the sitar), the bass in the forefront, and it's this that makes the album a cohesive one, yet songs like \\"Getting Better\\" keep the Beatle harmony alive, \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"Day in the Life\\" have the Lennon/McCartney balance. John is \\"out there\\" on \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\", but the songs are well-written enough to be enjoyed decades later.  <br /> <br />This does belong in every music lover's CD collection.  <br /> <br />The only complaints I have about this one are that the CD packaging takes a lot away from the original packaging which was a major part of the album. When they made \\"Yellow Submarine\\", some of the songs from \\"Pepper\\" were released on the soundtrack CD and the mix is a far better one. This is one where the mono mix is better than the stereo mix here, and they really should've packaged both versions on here, as well as a Surround mix (which can be heard on the Anthology and Yellow Submarine DVDs).  <br /> <br />It would even be better if they decided to do what they did with \\"Pet Sounds\\" and put a box set out of the sessions.  <br />
B000003S5H|5.0|\\"Moon Safari\\" is truly what it says it is. A journey into the depths of space and you will want to stay there. This is by far the best CD you'll ever purchase, in fact I rank it up there with Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and the Flaming Lips' \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\". Truly a classic for Stoners and people who enjoy spaced-out couch music. Every track on this album is incredible it'll take your mind and  blow it into space. Ear Candy tracks include: \\"Sexy Boy\\", \\"Kelly Watch the Stars\\", and \\"Femme d'Argent\\".
B0001AP12G|5.0|well he is wearing a bear suit in his album and this album and his music reminded me of when i had a chance with this girl i knew for going on 4 years and never got to talk to until the 3rd year well his music reminds me of that and since he is wearing a bear suit he looks like fluffyville or angabear or even kuriboh so he look like fluffyville so thats a good thing.
1592220053|5.0|A delightful collection of short stories, relating the travels and adventures of the oversized self-proclaimed space-faring \\"Ecological Engineer\\" Haviland Tuf.  These stories, for the most part, were orignally written in the mid-1980's, and this collection itself was originally published in 1986.<br /><br />I found the Haviland Tuf main character to be so uniquely different from any other SciFi character I've ever encountered, that it was delightfully refreshing.<br /><br />Virtually all of the seven stories themselves are individually captivating; however, my favorite is the first from the collection, Plague Star.  Plague Star is by far the longest individual story of the seven, weighing in at over 100 pages (none of the others are much more than 50 pages).<br /><br />Another unique factor regarding this book are the illustrations; which I also found to be another refreshing difference versus the hundreds of other SciFi books I've read.  I'd say that there are over 40 illustrations, and in all but maybe two or three cases, I found them to add to the enjoyment of the stories.<br /><br />Another kudo goes to the jacket art for the book - extremely well done, and oddly, nothing like the illustrations found inside.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it seems that the author's other works are mostly fantasy-related, and that he produced nothing else quite like these stories - so I suppose I'm going to have to be content with this limited sample of uniquely enjoyable SciFi.
B0006SSOHC|1.0|I don't expect much out of horror films these days, but as a gigantic fan of the genre, I subject myself to most decently buzzed-about films that are classified as horror. First off, very few films catagorized as horror films these days are. \\"Scream\\" is not a horror film; it is a mid-nineties FOX show with suspense and a killer. \\"Saw\\" is also not a horror film, in fact, it should not have been a film at all. Cary Elwes deserves some sort of award for the worst over-acting ever committed to film (put it right up there with his portrayal of Ted Bundy in \\"The Riverman\\" and we may have the worst actor of today on our hands), the script reads like it was written by a middle-school kid daydreaming out the window about one day killing the lunch recess bully, and the visuals are god-awful( the car scene narrowly beating out the cut-to-flashback format of the first two killings. Ever since that other tremendous film \\"Sixth Sense\\", we seem to always have to have the surprise ending in every horror film, as if it is a prerequiset for the film to be made. Very rarely is this ending a surprise; here it is no different. The difference is, this ending makes absolutely no sense. There was no preperation, no thorough introduction of the character and then no identification as to real motive. This is a film made by amateurs, and it shows. Whoever green lit this peace of trash, should not be allowed that respondsibility again. This film attempts to be clever, to make you think. What it achieves, though, is completely opposite. It is films/\\"art\\" like this that help to create a less intelligent society.
B000002L9Y|3.0|For my money, even though there have been some very good Mac albums before Nicks and Buckingham joined, the years between the \\"white album\\" (1975's Fleetwood Mac) and this one comprised their finest hours. On this CD, the magic is running out. There are fewer solid gems, more workmanlike average tunes, and a few outright clunkers.<br /><br />The hits here are \\"Seven Wonders\\",\\"Big Love\\", \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Little Lies\\". Of the four, Stevie Nicks' \\"Seven Wonders\\" is the most lackluster. It's pleasant, but it doesn't really stick with you. Christine McVie's resignation to a phony love affair in \\"Little Lies\\" as well as the full blush of infatuation in \\"Everywhere\\" fare best. Lindsey's \\"Big Love\\" is surprisingly \\"commercial\\" for him, but it's also kind of bland.<br /><br />Of the album tracks, Lindsey's \\"Family Man\\" is a catchy cut (seemingly a \\"we're all in the brotherhood of man\\" theme) with some nice flamenco styled guitar although a bit overlong. \\"Isn't it Midnight\\" probably SHOULD have been a hit. \\"You and I, Part II\\" has a calypso-ish melody and a similar theme to \\"Little Lies\\".<br /><br />On the downside, Christine and Lindsey's \\"Mystified\\" is so lowkey, it's faceless. \\"Welcome to the Room,Sara\\" is too obtuse to connect with most listeners (apparently it's supposed to be about a stay in drug rehab) and \\"Caroline\\" and \\"Tango in the Night\\" just never fully grab me.<br /><br />You'll want to have this if you're a Mac fan but you'll probably play it less than others. If you just like the radio singles, you're probably better off not buying this one and just getting \\"Greatest Hits\\".
B000068PQ0|1.0|is a melody that turns out to be a direct rip of a Cat Stevens song! At least they got sued for it. Way to go, Cat (I mean, Yusef)! This band is the biggest bunch of charlatans on the scene today. Perfect music for simple minded, easily fooled yuppies and wanna be yuppies to listen to on the way to Ikea. Blech. The emperor is officially desnudo. And certainly don't make the mistake of seeing this band live: all the confetti, romper room characters  and fake blood in the world can't make up for a complete and utter lack of talent (especially vocally). The success and acclaim of bands like this and the Arcade Fire and films like Donnie Darko or Requiem for a Dream will never cease to baffle me.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I am a Disney loyalist, but I have to admit that this is by far the most beautiful and artistic telling of Peter Pan ever put on film! First of all, it is closer to the ORIGINAL book. Secondly, they can now do stuff with live action movies and special effects that they could never do with earlier versions of Peter Pan films.  <br />In my opinion the casting could have been a little better for Peter and Hook, but the girl who plays Wendy is absolutely perfect!! Over all I think this is a very charming movie, and parents will enjoy watching this FRESH version of Peter Pan with their children instead of the old ones they are tired of.  <br />Nobody loves Disney and \\"Hook\\" (1991) more than I do, but I think this is the ultimate version of Peter Pan!
B00000AOUD|4.0|In response to \\"guitarnoize\\", yes, some of us do notice the drums, thank you! One of the reasons Tull's work was so great during this period was that Barlow was definitely in the top ranks of the 'English School', that batch of drummers who refuse to accept the role of merely 'human metronome', and brought power, limitless energy, and subtlety to the craft of British art rock during it's peak in the '70's. He's even better on \\"Minstrel In The Gallery\\", if anyone doesn't own that yet.  <br /> Like Genesis, Pink Floyd, and The Who ( prior to Zack! ), Tull lost something they never quite regained when the rhythm section stopped being focal to the performances. If the drummer's not bangin', you'll just be left hangin'!  <br /> Another sad trend is the disappearance of the original album inserts with the CD reissues. In all these special editions, I see no mention of a full, 12-page reproduction of the \\"St. Cleve Chronicle\\", the funny, complete suburban newspaper parody included in the original LP issue. Has anyone recieved this in one of the editions? This is another great glimpse into the feverishly droll mind of Ian Anderson, and it's especially fun for us Yanks, as it offers a glimpse of provicial 'England-isms'. Of course, in jewel-case size, a magnifying glass would have to be included, also!  <br /> Finally, if you're a fan of this period of Tull, I strongly recommend Caravan's \\"Land Of Grey And Pink\\", \\"For Girls Who Grow Plump In The Night\\", and \\"Waterloo Lily\\". This is brilliant art rock with a distinctly English whimsy and humor.
B000683VI4|5.0|My favorite movie,I could watch it many times and cry as if I'm watching it for the first time!
0385510454|4.0|I read Grisham for the same reason most people watch movies.  It is an escape from everyday life.  The Broker is no exception.  You will probably not learn anything real about spies or high tech gadgetry (read Tom Clancy for that), you will probably learn something about Italy, but most importantly, if you let yourself you can be caught up in another exciting ride.<br /><br />Grisham's novels are a bit formulaic, though some have strayed from the formula.  The formula here: lawyer (with love interest) in trouble must escape while life is in danger - is a tried and true, and works very well in this novel.  I enjoyed it, but have had my fill of Grisham for a while.
B0000035E7|5.0|When most people think of Nirvana they think of a few things. First you either recall The opening riff to \\"Smells like teen spirit\\" or the haunting chorus of \\"rape me\\" or if not that the bitter saddness in Kurt's voice during the unplugged session. This is before all of that, and it's phenominal. Bleach is much dirtier then nevermind or In utero; but not as distorted as with the lights out. There is not a bad song on this disk, the only one that mind turn some people off are \\"Mr. Moustache\\" or \\"Swap meet\\" but believe me they grow on you. On bleach Kurt's guitar as more \\"chunk\\" then any other album he did. The lyrics are simple but very Kurt, (listen to Floyd the barber closely...eww)however these lyrics make it more listenable. If nothing else I reccomend this album to anyone who likes rock music in general because it is different, yet accessible by the masses. If you can listen to the opening riff of \\"love buzz\\" and not tap your feet you are not human. Anyways it is a great addition to any collection. The only people I think will not get into this album are the people who are only interested in greatest hits packages, because if that's you the only song you will recognize is \\"about a girl\\".
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napolean Dynamite is one funny movie.  One great thing about it is that it highlights the awkwardness of high school, not only with Napolean (who is the king of weird) but even the \\"cool\\" kids don't have everything go their way.  I wanted to name my next kid Napolean, but everyone would associate it with the emperor not Preston, Idaho's biggest star.
0451523938|3.0|The book I read is about a man named Dr. Henry Jekyll.  He is a wealthy man who lives in London around 1885.  He was making some experiments on him self by taking drugs and turning into another person.  He named this person he changed into Mr. Hyde.  Dr. Jekyll was living with two different personalities.  He was living this character so often that he wrote a will leaving all his belongings to his other character in case he shifts to the other personality permanently.  This confused his friends.  A lawyer named Mr. Utterson who started investigating about the mystery of the will because Dr. Jekyll did not introduce him to this unknown character.  First, Mr. Utterson discussed Dr. Jekyll's character with Mr. Enfield.  Mr. Enfield told him about a man who had tripped over a little girl without realizing what he did just stood there silently with out any reaction for how he had tripped over the girl, while people gathered around to help the crying girl, the girl's father came shouting for the police.  The strange man finally spoke asking them not to call the police offering a 100 pounds.  They accepted the offer and went with him to a house where he brought out a Checkbook in the name of Dr. Jekyll and signed as Mr. Hyde.  Mr. Enfield took Mr. Utterson and showed him the door to that house.  Dr. Jekyll never mentioned Mr. Hyde's name to him.  He then went to visit Dr. Lanyon, a very close friend of Dr. Jekyll, to ask him about \\"Mr. Hyde.\\"  Dr. Lanyon knew Dr. Jekyll but he had no idea about Edward Hyde.  Mr. Utterson kept watching the back door at night, finally at the third night he saw a little man wearing large clothes at the door.  He stepped up to him and called him Mr. Hyde.  The man answered back \\"how do you know me.\\"  Mr. Utterson told him that Dr. Jekyll informed him about him because he is his lawyer.  The man ignored Utterson and quickly unlocked the door, walked in and shut the door behind him.  Mr. Utterson went to Dr. Jekyll's house and asked his servant,Poole, if Dr. Jekyll was in the house or not.  Poole said that he was out.  Then he asked him if he knows a Mr. Hyde and the servant answered that he is a friend of Dr. Jekyll however he had never met him because he usually comes in through the back door of the laboratory.  <br />In conclusion, Mr. Utterson's search for the identity of Mr. Hyde was still not going well.  He investigated with all the mutual friends.  He found through the letters send to him and the rest of the friends that Dr. Jekyll was involved in a serious experiment to control the evil part of his mind.  Unfortunately he was too late to save his dear friend Dr. Jekyll from his tragic end.  <br />
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is the most moving film I have ever seen.  It is comparative to Schindler's List in scale and scope, but where Steven Spielberg focuses on a German, a man that finds his morality during the holocaust, Roman Polanski centers on a victim. <br /> <br />Adrien Brody protrays Szpielman, pianist and composer, with brilliance and subtlety.  One watches a slow degradation in living conditions, in emotional structure and composure, but not in dignity.  The movie hits a climax with one scene, one heartrending scene, that those who've witnessed it will recognize and those who haven't must see.  I can't watch it without tears and I can't stop myself despite those tears. <br /> <br />Buy it.  If not that, see it.
B00005NOOH|5.0|One of the most impressive, non technical video treatments of the conflict.  Reasonably thorough in discussing the percursors, strategies, outcomes, and horrors across the three theatres of war.  If you want to understand WWII and do it quickly, this is the series to view!
1592400876|2.0|In my opinion, this book tries to do two things: note the correct vs. incorrect use of punctuation and impress upon the reader (or rather the writer) the importance of adhering to a standard of language that will clarify one's meaning. As far as correct vs. incorrect usage, the book creates no end of confusion.  It quotes from one novelist or playwright to another, goes back in time to the origin of certain punctuation norms, and tells us about English vs. American usage.  It shows so many variations in usage, and excuses so much of these variations, that what comes through is that there is really no absolute standard for the English language.  But on the second point, relating punctuation to clarity, she is right on.  While some of her examples seem just plain silly (has anyone ever seen confusion between a comma and an apostrophe) her point comes across to me as: pay attention to punctuation and use it with logic and deliberation. <br /> <br />I don't understand why she has to include a paean to herself in her Foreword . . that is just plain rude to the reader, who has already purchased the book, and who should be able to make up his/her own mind about how great the author is.
0670033375|5.0|_Collapse_ by Jared Diamond is an absolutely epic look at why some past societies that faced grave environmental problems failed, why others succeeded, and what this \\"rich database\\" of past civilizations tells us about the current and future problems we face in our world. By the word collapse, Diamond meant a drastic decrease in population as well as in the economy and political and social complexity of a society, as opposed to a more gradual or milder form of decline. While he admitted that sometimes the distinction between a milder form of decline and a collapse is in some cases arbitrary (how drastic does the decline have to be before it is labeled as a collapse), Diamond analyzed a number of \\"full-fledged collapses\\" that few people would disagree with classifying as such. <br /> <br /> The primary theme of this book is the nature of environmental problems that society face, which he listed in eight categories (habitat destruction and particularly deforestation, soil problems such as erosion and salinization, water supply and management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of alien species, human population growth, and increased per capita impact of people), and what they choose to do (or not do) about them.  <br /> <br />Diamond made two additional points. The first is that it is nave to assume that societies have collapsed solely due to human-caused environmental damage. He provided a five-point framework of possible contributing factors, some of which were at work in the collapse of a given civilization, while others were not. Four of these factors - environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, and friendly trade partners (or the lack thereof) - may not prove significant to a particular society's fortunes, but the fifth factor (a civilization's responses to its environmental problems), always does. The second point is that Diamond is not an advocate of any philosophy of environmental determinism - that the environment in which a civilization exists in means that it will ultimately fail. While for instance the moai-erecting civilization of Easter Island collapsed, the society found on much smaller Tikopia Island (1.8 square miles) has existed for 3,000 years  (and still exists) on an island with sustainable cultivation; the Greenland Norse ultimately failed while the Inuit on the same island still exist.  <br /> <br />After an introduction of concepts - including a comparison with modern day Montana - Diamond analyzed in depth the collapse of several past societies, namely that of Easter Island, Pitcairn Island, Henderson Island (both islands are in the Pacific and formerly had Polynesian societies which died out), the Anasazi, the Classic Lowland Maya, and the Greenland Norse, the last of which he spent a great deal of time discussing and made for absolutely fascinating reading.  More briefly he analyzed some past (and still existing) societies that overcame grave environmental crises (that of Iceland, Tikopia Island, the New Guinea highlands, and Japan of the Tokugawa era). To me these sections (around half the book) were the best part (I found lots of very interesting information in the Easter Island chapter).  <br /> <br />Within the framework of these success stories he illustrated two contrasting approaches to environmental success, namely that of a bottom-up approach to a problem (one in which individuals in a society make choices and perform actions to correct environmental problems, as with Tikopia and the New Guinea highlands) and the top-down approach (found in large societies with a centralized political structure, such as Tokugawa Japan). Additionally, both bottom-up and top-down approaches may exist side by side. <br /> <br />Next, Diamond focused on several modern societies that face grave environmental problems today and in the future, specifically Rwanda, Haiti (which he contrasted vividly with the neighboring Dominican Republic), China, and Australia, going into a great deal of detail about their history, culture as it relates to the environment, current environmental problems, and what is being done (if anything) to correct these problems. I found the chapters on Haiti/Dominican Republic (another example he wrote that there is no such thing as environmental determinism) and Australia particularly interesting.  <br /> <br />The fourth part of the book is a section he titled \\"practical lessons;\\" what analysis of collapses, success stories, and modern problems have taught us about what can be done. One thing he wrote is that he disliked single factor explanations for problems or single factor issues for activists to focus on. For instance, with the contrasting environmental realities of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, their differing developments were \\"overdetermined;\\" a number of separate factors coincided to produce the current reality. Another is that for a society to continue to exist at sustainable levels in a deteriorating environment (or for a Third World society to become a First World one), it must decide as a society which of its deeply held core values are compatible with its continued survival, which are not, and then give up those that are not. For instance the love for the farming lifestyle in Australia is a core value in Australia, but to continue having that as a core value may be incompatible with a healthy environment.  <br /> <br />Diamond discussed in detail why societies fail to solve their environmental problems. Briefly, a civilization may fail to anticipate a problem before it arises, it may fail to perceive a problem after it does arrive, they may not even try to solve it, or they may try to solve it and fail. Regarding the second problem he made some interesting points about \\"creeping normalcy\\" (the difficulty in recognizing a gradual downward trend over years because what constitutes \\"normalcy\\" shifts \\"gradually and imperceptibly\\") and \\"landscape amnesia\\" (forgetting what a landscape looked like in the past because the downward change has been so gradual that residents in an area are less aware of it, comparing changes unconsciously to the last few years rather than say 50 years ago). <br /> <br />Diamond does close with saying he is cautiously optimistic that the world's environmental problems can be solved, providing examples of success stories and answering common \\"one-liner objections\\" to environmental policies. A truly excellent book, I highly recommend it.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have watched this several times and am still loving it.  This was the best series I have ever seen, sci-fi or not.  The character development and acting are absolutely superb.  With the DVD, you can watch the episodes in marathon style or relax and take your time.  So many people love this show, you'd think that somebody would have picked it up after the FOX blunder in canceling it.  I hope the movie, Serenity, does well enough to get it back on TV.  Movies are good, but are a different animal.  With a series, you get time to develop characters and Joss is a genius.  There are SO many unanswered mysteries in Firefly and many many subtle things there that you can watch the episodes many times and take something new from them each time.<br /><br />If there were 10 stars, I'd give it 10.  I can't say enough good things about this show.  It is everything a great series should be.  Writing, acting, directing, music...all fantastic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Unfortunately i have to confess i did not watch firefly when it was on tv because i am not a huge fan of scifi im more into fantasy. However as i am a big joss whedon fan i had been looking forward to watching this series for a long time beacause i had heard so many good things about it. i was hooked after the first time i heard the theme song, this show is amazing and i cannot wait to see the movie serenity!!!!! I am also sad that it got cancelled because i feel it had so much more to offer. So if you are a fan of Joss you will love this and even if you arent you cant not like this!
B000002BFZ|5.0|Let me start by saying that this is a wonderful album, as many reviewers have rightly said. It is not similar to any great extent to previous work, and is perhaps, better for it. <br /> <br />It starts off with the gentle Sometimes, leading into the frenetic romance of Hail Hail. <br />Then, PJ struck gold. Who You Are is just a really pretty song, end of story. I don't care if it isn't the next Alive. It isn't supposed to be! <br />Of course, In My Tree is a magical song, that really cheers you up when you're low. <br />Smile, I don't get. It's a good song and all, but it falls short of greatness. There is no cigar. Off He Goes, however, is a soft, touching masterpiece. <br />Habit is heavy. Not outstanding, but it's Pearl Jam - their worst is another's pipe dream. <br />Now, into the CD's best phase. <br />Red Mosquito features some excellent lyrics and one hell of a guitar workout from Mike. Moving on into Lukin, which is both a pummelling punk fury, and a hilarios shout-a-thon. <br />Present Tense is gorgeous, start to finish. Interestingly spare instrumentation at the start. Mankind is a poppy, singalong wonder, featuring Mr. Gossard on vocals, and he does a great job. <br />Now, this is where my headline comes into play, and where a lot of reviewers slip up. This is not a failed attempt at living up to 'rock' expectations, this is a beautiful, ambient work of art, cementing Vedder's status as a literary genius. <br />End excellent phase. <br />Around the Bend is genle, and sweet, but nothing extraordinary. I think I'm Open would have made for a more interesting end to the album. Anyone who doesn't like it, listen to it alone in a dark room. You'll see.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Ahh, 1997.  Where would we be without that revolutionary, all-important year in popular music history?  Just look at all the worthless artists who made it big in '97--Aqua--Hanson--Spice Girls--Backstreet Boys--and of course, Radiohead, the most horrible, attrocious, untalented \\"suck-o-rama\\" band to ever disgrace the airwaves. <br /> <br />Radiohead are a dispicable band.  They are basically flawed.  They cannot play their instruments, so they cover up that phenominal lack of talent with drum machines, synthesisers, and annoying sound effects.  This album is so overproduced that you can barely even hear the instruments.  If there is any good instrument playing, you can't even hear it.  Its been completely drowned out!  All traces of the guitars have been obliterated behind a faceless wall of electronic, computerized sound effects.  There are no riffs to be found anywhere on here, nothing even remotely musical--its just--noise!  It sounds like somebody just pushing buttons at random in the studio. <br /> <br />Now anybody with any common sense at all would realise how much this CD sucks.  But Radiohead's record company started spreading propaganda all through the media.  By 1998, the mainstream media had unaminously declared this the \\"best album of all time\\", claiming that it was \\"Complex\\" and \\"innovative\\".   Radiohead is the kind of band NOBODY likes, but everybody pretends to like them, just to seem hip and sophisticated.  And judging by the 5 star ratings this CD has, it looks like I'm still the only person with the guts to admit just how terrible this CD is.
B0007TKH66|5.0|Now that UPN has cancelled Enterprise, hopefully a strong DVD sale will change TPTB's minds to produce a fifth season of this good show that is only getting better. Every Trek spin-off had a few bad seasons before finding their footing and the same goes for ENT. Give it a chance, it really is a great show!!
038572179X|5.0|I started reading this book and wasn't to interested in what was happening to Briony. I put it down and a week later started where I had ended and read one more chapter. I was hooked. Ian McEwan understands the way an adolescent mind works and write masterfully. The book never lost my interest from that time forward. I felt a part of the story and had my own desires for the characters. This book is AMAZING!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Sometimes the hilarity of a moment comes through a discourse or sentence that cuts through the boundaries of life and stops a conversation dead. Napoleon Dynamite is full of one liners that my friends and I just can't stop saying, and they're the kinds of things that we can equate with so many of the other people we know.<br /><br />The art of this film is that it portrays its heroes and villains in such a subtle way. We learn to sympathize with Pedro in his rise to glory. Our hearts cry out in anger against the bullish nature of Uncle Rico and the popular kids. Still, we cannot help but leave this movie mourning the sadness of all the lives represented.<br /><br />This movie is not without happy endings. Redemption comes in the form of relationships as we see healing borne in Grandma and her reuniting with her beloved llama. Rico is found again by a lost love who hated to dwell on the past. Kip draws together two cultures as he marries someone who is so completely different than himself.<br /><br />I laughed out loud in the theater when I watched this movie, and again when I watched it with my wife. It's great to watch something that can be so funny and yet still not be bombarded with sexual innuendo (with the exception of Rico's prescribed herbal enhancers and the principal's odd smile while watching highschoolers dance) and rampant violence.<br /><br />The DVD itself is full of wonderful features, great commentaries, and is double sided (full screen or wide screen). If you don't buy it, then at least try it. Be warned, however, as most all either hate the movie or they love it.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's classic black comedy about Cold War tensions still provides fertile ground for brilliant satire that has not so much dated as become a cutting period piece about the misdirected patriotism pervasive within the country's mindset at the time. I'm so glad Sony has decided to re-release this masterwork in a brand-new print on DVD, as it is well worth appreciating again, especially as we go through the uncertainty of American imperialism in Iraq. This movie, however, focuses on a different target, the Soviet Union, our then-competing superpower, and how the U.S. manages the threats of a demented general hell-bent on dropping nuclear payloads onto Russia. His motivation for attack is rooted in a paranoia-driven \\"Commie plot\\" he is convinced the Russians are hatching through the flouridation of the water supply in the U.S. This far-fetched premise is played out not by stand-up comedians ridiculing the government for cheap laughs but by a cast of accomplished actors who seem to be playing their roles quite seriously.<br /><br />Propelled by a smart, insightful and hilarious script by Kubrick and Terry Southern, this straight-faced approach makes the gravity of the situation all the more resonant, while making their characters' failures all the more bitingly funny. Aside from the unblinking honesty of the script, the acting is brilliant for the most part with an eccentric cast that includes Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens. In a triple play of comedy genius, Peter Sellers portrays a British Army captain who tries to reason with the general; the title character, a German-accented strategist with an uncontrollable right hand and an eerie similarity to Henry Kissinger; and funniest of all, the U.S. President, an Adlai Stevenson look-alike whose soft-spoken manner is challenged by the mad scramble of events that depend on his leadership.  In fact, Sellers' scenes in the War Room as President Merkin Muffley are hysterical in the very conflict of personalities that give rise to the inevitable ending. As brilliantly versatile as Sellers is, I still believe George C. Scott, with his rubbery face, exaggerated gestures and macho manner, gives the film's best performance as yet another general, a gung-ho type more than ready to take out the Russians. The climax of the film encapsulates the absurdity and gravity of the story well with Pickens astride a nuclear missile like a rodeo cowboy riding a bucking steer. Kubrick was never as funny with his subsequent films (even \\"The Shining\\" seems misbegotten by comparison), which is a shame since he had an acute gift for capturing the seriousness of human failure within the context of dark comedy.<br /><br />The two-disc DVD package has loads of extras, most of which bring added context for the timeless significance of the film despite its Cold War setting. These include several good documentaries - an informative one focused on the making of the film itself, plus two others that trace the careers of Kubrick and Sellers, respectively; and finally, a new film that explains the sociological influence of the film today. Strongly recommended even if you feel you've seen it many times before.ies that give rise to the inevitable ending. As brilliantly versatile as Sellers is, I still believe George C.

B000002J0B|5.0|Imagine turning out four of the most successful and groundbreaking heavy metal/blues-rock albums of all time, only to go on turning out more outstanding material. Very few bands in history have consistently delivered mind-blowing albums one after the other for an extended period of time the way Zeppelin has. Zeppelin had invented the sound of the decade, and by 1973, they were really ready to spread their wings (as if they hadn't already).<br /><br />\\"Houses Of The Holy\\" follows the same foot steps as \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", but the approach is much more easy-going. Jimmy Page's riffs range from folk hooks as well as his classic blues-rock hooks, giving the album a lighter and looser feel. The album kicks off with epic \\"The Song Remains the Same\\". \\"The Rain Song\\" is a moody, meandering tune, sprawling progressive rock arrangements touching on classical music, jazz, blues, and folk, as well as hard rock. Robert Plant's vocals are soulful and heartfelt. \\"The Rain Song\\" also shows Jimmy Page's growth as a producer. \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" was a further progression away from the band's original heavy blues into more diverse arrangements. The acoustic introduction is a variation of Jimmy Page's own \\"White Summer,\\" which was highly influenced by Davey Graham's \\"She Moved Thro' the Fair.\\" The affectionate James Brown send-up \\"The Crunge,\\" one of my favorites, really adds to the diversity of the album. \\"Dancing Days\\" gives you a solid taste of their classic hard rock strut. The reggae-influenced song \\"D'Yer Mak'er\\", featuring John Bonham's driving drums makes for an exceptional love song. The song was released as a single and reached the top 20, staying on the charts for total of eight weeks. Zeppelin's spooky \\"No Quarter\\" is a jazz, bluesy jam. The songs starts off with John Paul Jones' electric piano, reminiscent of the Doors' \\"Riders On The Storm\\". The song jumps into Bonham's hard-hitting drums, then leads into Page's blues-rock riff, backed by an analog synthesizer. Plant paints a picture of creepy images within his soaring slowed-down vocals. \\"The Ocean\\" makes for a great closer, featuring a funky guitar riff from Page, into an a cappella, going out swinging.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a \\"best\\" Zeppelin album. Usually my favorite is the one I am currently listening too. \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" lives up to the reputation of their first four masterpieces. They took a chance and were unfazed by the spotlight. This album adds dramatic influence to heavy metal, blues-rock and hard rock as we know it today.

B0006SSOHM|4.0|I wanted to start this review by sharing a few choice words toward the handful of individuals who said this was a bad movie, but better I think that I stay on the point of reviewing this movie. The mistake I think many had going into this movie with, is the belief that it was a horror movie in the genre of movies like HALLOWEEN, NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, AND FRIDAY THE 13th, (which are played out and tired at this point)and for those of you that enjoy this particular type of horror, please dont waste your time on this movie. This movie is what I like to consider SMART HORROR, found in movies like SEVEN, or any one of the HANNIBAL, movies (where the flavor of the movie is built on suspense and the frightening thought that THERE REALLY ARE WACKED OUT SOCIAPATHS LIVING AMONGST US THAT REALLY DO COMMIT CRIMES LIKE THIS and that we, one day could become a victim to such an individual). For I am sorry to say, it sems unlikely that any of us will ever have to face the unkillable monsters found in Halloween, Nightmare, or Friday, for to me, as a child such movies were quite scary, but now as an adult, the fear factor of such characters are laughable at best.  Heck I'll be honest even when I went to the website [...] I was thoughoughly creeped out. I dont like to be a SPOILER as some are in their movie reviews so ill just ask a few questions (from the movie) to help you decide if youd like to see it: Would you be willing to kill another person to save yourself? Would you be willing to suffer amputation in order to save yourself and family? How would you handle being left alone to die? If your interest has been stirred by these questions then please check this movie out, I consider myself I true horror fan and must say this movie was well worth it <br />P.S. to the greedy Hollywood moguls that are presently working on SAW 2 I beg of you dont and I repeat dont turn this into another worthless sequel (or number of sequels) that destroys an excellent concept like the first threemovies I mentioned in this review
B00064VR0W|5.0|Others have described the details of the show so I won't bore you except to say that if you're a Rod fan, especially one like me who's loved his work for (groan) over 35 years, I'll just say that... THIS ONE'S GONNA FLOOR YA. Just a fabulous performance (and for once, consistently great camerawork and great editing.) But I do want to tell you about one song, one very special moment. As we know, late one night a thousand years ago Long John Baldry discovered Rod as he was singing in a lonely train station, and took him under his wing. Rod's returned the favour big time. Imagine if you will being a very young woman busking on the streets of Glasgow... and one week later descending a beautifully lit grand staircase to the stage of the Royal Albert Hall to sing \\"I Don't Wanna Talk About It\\" on live national TV with Rod Stewart. God, how this girl keeps it together is beyond me, but she does, she in fact KILLS. It's an exquisitely beautiful, deeply moving, very human moment. A great moment of artistic generosity on Rod's part, and a lump-in-the-throat moment for the viewer as Amy Belle experiences what must have been the peak moment of her life. It's unforgettable, and there wasn't a dry eye in this house I can promise you. Oh, and any Rod fan who's hesitant about this American Songbook stuff, not to worry, his performance of these old chestnuts is fabulous, as though they'd been written for him or by him. And the final number, \\"Sailing,\\" is a knockout. I think this DVD simply backs up what I've always maintained, which is that Rod is the greatest solo act of our generation. Rod, if you're reading this, a million thanks for all the pleasure over five decades, all the unforgettable shows, from a little kid from the Boston Tea Party...
B000006045|5.0|One of my all-time favorite cd's, and Massive Attack's best by far.  The musicianship that went into making this disc is top-notch; the groove just can't be beat.

Buy it today...you won't be disappointed.
B000002BFL|5.0|I just got this, and it is a wonderful change for springsteen.  I had previously heard Rage against the Machine's cover version of the TGOTJ song, and liked it for awhile, and that version is as far from the real thing as you can get.  The whole cd is very quiet, so don't look for a headbanging cd.  The songs are well arranged, particularly with the moody synth effect which enhances the delivery.  My 2 favorites are the title song and Youngstown, which is probably one of the greatest songs he has ever written in my book.  Do not overlook the songs just because they are mellow, because Springsteen has really succeeded in bringing his real message through in these songs.  This is one you should listen to before you buy, and you will probably want to get a used copy as they are cheaper.  Hope you like it though!
B000683VI4|5.0|One the best love stories EVER! If you don't see this movie your are truly missing out!(Have some kleenex handy).
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is in my honest opinion the best offering which the action genre has ever produced, it can hold it's own when compared with the very best movies of the eighties. <br /> <br />The character of Ripley is given a very strong willful interpretation by Sigourney Weaver, her performance here when contrasted with the more demure and warm roles she has played reveal her to be an actress with some range. The secondary characters in the movie were likewise, well constructed and interpreted. Some of the scenes and characters are fascinating, from the Android knife trick to the occasional attenpts at humor (appropriately sequestered to the beginning of the film, before the tension takes hold) \\"Hey Vasquez did anyone ever mistake you for a man?\\" - \\"no, You?\\". The main villain in the movie, the character Burke, is very well acted by the actor who plays him, this guy comes across as oily and psychotic as...well...your average politician. Amother good performance was that of the young girl. As the tension builds and the body count rises, there are enough twists and changes to keep it extremely tense and entertaining. The Aliens themselves were fantastic, sleek chitinous insectile horrors with an air of extreme malevolence stalking the survivors through the abandoned space port.  <br /> <br />What is especially interesting is the reversal of traditional Gender Roles in many parts of the film. Take Ripley and Hicks, this male character comes across as an awestruck schoolboy as he yields to everything Ripley suggests without any questions, while her character is deliberately designed (in the film) to exude a greater aura of command and courage than the Marines (to strengthen her warrior - credentials). The other female Soldier looks like a butch Lesbian (oops not very pc i know - sorry), even the little girl is portrayed as having more courage than one whining scared marine. Lastly the male commander of the mission is a slightly cowardly educated type who is unsure of himself.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Well I thought this movie was awesome. I loved it. When I first saw it, years ago I loved it and even to this day, I still do. Sure Rasputin is portrayed as a super-human psychotic maniac who wanted the Romanov family dead... Even though it has not been proven that Anastasia was still alive... and even though the movie never mentioned that Aleixi's body was also missing not just Anastasia... it was still a great movie, with fabulous songs. Definately not recommended for small children due to frightening scenes... unless of course the children are already corrupted... then by all means.
B000002UAO|5.0|But I do. I am generally not considered the age to like Beatles music. But considering that what's out today, and the last, I dunno, twelve years, there's not a lot of original (did you see that word I used - original - look it up) talent anymore. What do we have now? Brittany and Justin recycling '80's Michael Jackson. Green Day? Punk is so '70's. Metal? started in the '60's, kids. Most of the new bands are basically retro. Franz Ferdinand?  Well, it's good your favorite band is making millions, but talk to me about them in a few years. Oops! Where's they go? Calling Oasis! Anyone seen Oasis? Aren't you embarrased you bought their CD's? <br /> The mere fact that we're discussing this and all Beatles' music and not '80's metal is because the Beatles are still outselling nearly all that's come after them. Rubber Soul is what, the Beatles' fifth album. How many of Poison's fifth album were sold last year compared to Rubber Soul? Oh, wait, did Poison ever make it to a fifth album? Ask yourself why! Is it a plot by baby boomers to keep rebuying the same albums over and over to prove you wrong? Yes! No! Maybe, you paranoid ingnoramus. <br />I see people ragging about this being their Grandparent's music. Sour grapes. You missed it. You didn't have a band like this and all you see is Beatles, Beatles, Beatles. And it makes you mad. Never mind the reason the Beatles' are still being written about and sold daily. They were the best, that's all. There can be only one Best. Johnny Carson, another example, in another genre. I discovered the Beatles after the fact, and there ain't no going back, Jack. <br />Rubber Soul is the first of the Beatles' holy trinity (Revolver and Sgt. Pepper round it out) that make up their mid period (Magical Mystery Tour fits somehow in there...let's see, four into three makes three. Right. Got it.) The recording studio as a tool, not just a place to lay down tracks. Mixing music genres (oh, nowadays when an artist does that, the critics get all foamy-mouthed with praise, like it's new or something). Classic songs even those with the most pubescent adolescent attitude, no matter how young or old they are, must admit they know of. This band didn't just change rock and roll, they changed SHOW BUSINESS big time, and the course of history, indirectly. <br />So get used to it, like Beethoven or Abe Lincolon, you're going to hear about The Beatles for the rest of your life. Beatles, Beatles, Beatles. Nyah. So why not open your mind and listen, starting with this album. Hear the band that has become a part of the history of the world, not just of rock and roll music. Remember, what you think is cool now will be laughed at someday, too (your sagging tatoos, perhaps). But then, they'll be right.  <br />The Beatles will always be cool.
B000683VI4|5.0|I am currently in love and this movie totally has depicted my life, the mother reminded me of my own mother and the movie is just an overall great movie
B000001ESF|4.0|I really like the song 2112, but tears and the twilight zone aren't very good.  The other songs are pretty good.  This was back when Geddy had a really screechy voice, which I don't like.  I think the most powerful element of music is the singing, not necessarily the instruments.  This seems to be the opposite with Rush, who are consistently brilliant musicians, but not necessarily that great at singing or songwriting.  There are several awkward moments in 2112 that I find quite irritating, such as when Geddy sings \\"what can this strange device be..\\" and the weird kind of boring guitar intro to that section of the song.  They were still finding their way, and this is still one of the best Rush albums, but don't get it unless you have heard it.  Lifeson's guitar is quite incredible on this cd, something that would later change with excessive synth use.  Or you could get the live Different Strings, which has 2112 in its entirety and is very well played instead of this cd.
B000654Z2I|5.0|Tago Mago, Can's first studio album with the walking freakshow Damo Suzuki behind the mic, is art in its highest form. A double album composed of great Krautrock and transe-rock, interspersed with bits of avant-garde noise collages. There certainly weren't many albums this ambitious back in the mid 70's, or in the mid 2000's come to think of it. The album is seven songs that clock in at about 1 hour and 13 minutes. That may sound pretentious or intimidating, but Can always make their odd journeys easy to listen to. I rarely skip a track even though 'Peking O' is one of the strangest songs this side of Ummagumma. And Halleluhwah, clocking in at 18 min. 32 sec. is quite simply the greatest song in the Can catalog. Although I feel that their follow-up, Ege Bamyasi, is a better overall album, Tago Mago is still just as good, if not a little polarizing on first listen. For that reason alone, I would recommend starting with Ege Bamaysi, then get Tago Mago. And don't forget Future Days & Monster Movie.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|warning: Mothers please do not let your child that is below the age of 5 watch this movie. It will give them nightmares, of things in the closet. Personal experience 2004. Thank You
B0006J28BO|5.0|Personal identity is the most important part of your life. It defines you and makes you unique. Without identity, you lose a sense of direction. Like a cat, you would do nothing but eat, drink and sleep your life away, blissfully unaware of what you are missing.  <br /> <br />This is the message underlying The Cat Returns, Studio Ghibli's last movie before the Miyazaki-directed Howl's Moving Castle (in American theaters June 10). After over a decade of deep and sometimes-harrowing movies, Studio Ghibli executives decided it was time for a light-hearted film enjoyable as pure entertainment. With The Cat Returns, they accomplished just that.  <br /> <br />Based on a manga (graphic novel) by Japanese artist Aoi Hiiragi and helmed by rookie director Hiroyuki Morita, The Cat Returns is a spin-off of Whispers of the Heart, 1995's Ghibli-made movie based on Hiiragi's work.  <br /> <br />The movie tells the tale of Haru, an awkward high school student whose life just isn't going well. She is often late for class, she is clumsy and her secret crush is going out with a freshman. Unfortunately for poor Haru, things are going to get worse. Haru saves the life of a cat, who turns out to be Prince Lune of the Kingdom of Cats, a peaceful paradise of eating, sleeping and anthropomorphic felines.  <br /> <br />After a nocturnal visit from the King of Cats, Haru finds her life spiraling out of control, culminating in the arrangement of a marriage with the feline Prince. Just as the situation seems hopeless, Haru is directed to the home of the Baron, a gentlemanly cat with a knack for helping those in need, and his companions, the gluttonous Muta and the noble crow, Toto. The trio swears to save Haru from a disgraceful, inter-species marriage, but she is whisked away to the Kingdom of Cats before they hatch a plan. With the perpetually grumpy Muta as her only companion, Haru warms up to life in the Cat Kingdom, but eventually realizes that she is changing into a cat. She must leave the Kingdom by sunrise to return to human form.  <br /> <br />The Cat Returns is a whimsical movie. Many critics attack The Cat Returns as shallow and lacking the powerful message of films like Nausica or the strong emotions of films like Porco Rosso, and they're right. But, nonetheless, The Cat Returns is a highly entertaining film, reminiscent of Takahata's old Panda Go Panda shorts, playful romps through imaginary worlds.  <br /> <br />The Cat Returns is wildly hilarious, with excellent one-liners and brutal slapstick. It is hard to keep a straight face during the brilliant and hysterical execution scene. And with a 75-minute run-time, The Cat Returns is a perfect cinematic pick-me-up. That said, its quick resolution can leave viewers disappointed. Plus, potentially compelling supporting characters (namely, Haru's mother and friends) remain tragically underdeveloped.  <br /> <br />With its simple storyline, The Cat Returns does not come close to equaling the quality of other Ghibli works. Even so, it is still a hell of a movie, and is better than nine out of 10 recent Disney movies.  <br />
B000067CQK|5.0|I'm writing this review mainly to stress how bad the packaging is.  The cds come prescratched for your listening pleasure.  The packaging comes ready to fall apart and partially torn where the staples are.  In otherwords, if you happen to pick this up, get it new.  It's in bad enough shape new, so you don't want to get a used copy.  I find the Aladin Sane 30th aniversary edition to have slightly better packaging.  Anyway, when you get this put the cd's in a new case so they won't get scratched more than they already are.  Also beware that some copies of disc two are defective.   <br /> <br />Having said that, this remaster sounds great and has 2nd disc full of rarities only found on bootlegs and 4 of the tracks can be found on the ryko version of ziggy.  You know how good the album is so I won't go into detail.
B000002B30|4.0|all of the songs are pretty good, but springsteen seems to be a bit of a faker. His songs aren't really about anything really new or revolutionary, but they all sound good.  He talks a lot about fighting in wars, but he never actually fought in a war.  Or the working class, though he has never held a real job.  His songs are fun to listen to, from all his albums, but take the imagery with a grain of salt.  I honestly like The Ghost of Tom Joad and Nebraska and The Rising better than most of the songs on this collection, but it is an essential overview of a fairly important musician.  His politics may seem quite annoying, but he means well.
B000002UB3|5.0|If i had to choose the best beatles album and therefore the best album ever i would have to go with abbey road. Revolver,pepper etc are all great but this one tops them all. From the experimental and downright weird 'i want you' to the simple beauty of songs like 'because' & 'here comes the sun' this one is simply unbeatable. Even the quirky songs like 'octopuses garden' & 'silver hammer' are charming. A majestic Cd that belongs in YOUR collection! <br />
B000003TAR|5.0|Kurt Cobain is often referred to as a genuis musically who wrote flawless lyrics. This may be true but this is not why Nirvana were such a success. Mozart was a genuis I don't want to listen to him do you? Kurt did things his own way, he hated many bands who were popular at the time, he wasn't afraid to say so, he yelled and screemed made his guitar play disturbing feedback witch sounded awesome and smashed up the stage at Nirvana gig's even before he was rolling in the benjamins. He said he was not a Rock Star but the true spirit of Rock N' Roll shone as bright as it ever has from anyone in his sort of mundane lethargic performances on stage. Nirvana were important for Rock. But I would stop short of saying they have insipred most of today's bands because most of today's bands are as far removed from Nirvana as humanely possible. I also don't like it when fans say Aww kurt was so mercifull towards this and that blah blah. Listen you don't know Kurt you think you know him because of a few dramatized interviews you've read gimme a break. All we know is what we hear in his songs it's about the music and not much else. Just forget all the crap you read and hear because it's all a soap opera and crank the music whilst doing whatever it is you do, don't take it to serious, just play some air guitar and pretend to smash up the stage afterwards.
0345440900|1.0|i bought this book after having read so many rave-reviews about it. im a first-time mum and therefore an avid reader of baby books and i dont believe in just reading those i agree with 100pct so even though i disagreed with a few of tracey hogg's premises, i decided to read on. <br /> <br />i was SO disappointed!!! i found the condescending tone of the book utterly unbearable to start with. being called \\"luv\\" every second sentence was more nauseating than i care to mention and being told that there isnt a baby on earth whose \\"problems\\" she cant solve (given that apparently all babies fit into four neat categories) was just plain unbelievable. <br /> <br />i do agree however with hogg that babies should be treated with respect, but any child-care expert worth their salt will tell you the same thing. what did it for me was reading that while hogg does not advocate letting children cry it out, she also says that she does not believe babies should be held or rocked unless the parent is meeting a particular need at that time as it will ultimately make them less independent and foster bad habits. for someone who is herself a mother, i could not believe that she could take such a ghastly, insensitive approach to child care and it was more than i could handle. at that point, i put the book down forever. <br /> <br />if youre looking for great child-care books, read anything by dr william sears, or the \\"no-cry sleep solution\\" by elizabeth pantley. these are wonderful books for anyone who believes that parenting a baby should be done from the heart, not in accordance to some cold, formulaic regime.
B00000373U|5.0|Alright I'm not saying this is a personal account of his life, but musically you get it all here.  Elliott Smith has crafted some of the finer moments in music of the last century.  Every aspect of his work blends and mixes so well.   <br /> <br />Songwriting, sheer power of his hands as they grazed the guitar with a bit of hesitation to let out some revealing thoughts and ponders.   <br /> <br />You can tell this guy was leaking his heart and soul out to us with such simple yet provactive casual flair.  After going through some crazy Beatles binges, I have to say there's no comedown in music that compares to Elliott Smith, and this I feel is his shining moment/finest hour.
B000002NBY|5.0|although simon often seems quite conceited and full of himself, he still makes really good music that is very good and should be heard by everyone.  This is a desert island disc for me certainly.  Just go get it somehow, you'll really think its one of the best things from any musical period!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|ok i'm not really the biggest \\"metal\\" fan. However i am a maggot all the way to the core. I love every album slipknot has done. This one totally rocks!! I love every song on it, which is rare for me with any cd. The slower songs really show the vocal talent corey has. they are absolutely beautiful, yet still very slipknot. this album is so full of energy and feeling. Its their best yet.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard about Firefly, I was skeptical.  A space western?  Sounded like another crummy gimmick show.  I am elated to say I was so wrong!  If you're looking for a show with clever writing, crisp wit, involving characters, and enjoyable plots, you've found it!  In fact, my husband and I enjoy the series SO much (and he was another one who needed to be convinced) that we've bought this DVD set as gifts for others.  Who, by the way, also love the show now.  Our only complaint?  That the show was cancelled, leaving us to savor only 14 episodes - again and again and again....

B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral is not a particularly easy film to review. It borrows heavily from film noir conventions and is dependent on a rigid plot. It's more like a play than a standard movie in that it relies on strong characters and a simple chance series of events to make its point. To respond to earlier reviewers, I would argue that the plot is supposed to be implauseable in order to illustrate the idea that life is basically a set of events over which even the most prepared individuals have little control. Vincent epitomises the man in control. He is witty, dangerous, and utterly ruthless, a professional who is not the overly compentent standard sociopathic antagonist. In the rules of the game in Collateral, no matter how in control a character like Vincent is, he or she can still be taken out completely by chance. Of course, the shot that kills Vincent is blind luck. What better irony that the consumate professional killed by someone he never considered a threat who he could have killed under any other circumstances?
B000000W5H|5.0|You Know I am a long time Stones fan and it has been a blast to put my collection back together with the Remasters.<br /><br />I think if you really like the Stones you cant go wrong with this disk.the first 5 songs are Awsome  If you can't rock me and ain't to proud are classics and next goodbye and time waits just flow putting you in a relaxing and retrospective mood.<br /><br />I thing this cd kicks ass, Luxury and dance little sister are<br /><br />classics as well. you can play this cd from start to finish and let it restart it's that good.  Stones are the best , you won't regret this. buy it it's great.
B000001C6M|4.0|Although there are better Slayer albums than this, I find this album certainly has a charm of its own, nevermind some classic tunes like \\"The Antichrist\\" and \\"Fight Till Death\\".  <br />This album shows a Slayer that hasn't yet developed a truly unique sound with the songs essentially framed in a rock format. It sounds a bit like Venom, but better. Show No Mercy is much the same album for Slayer that Kill 'Em All was for Metallica. In fact, the albums are strikingly similar in places! Just listen to \\"Tormentor\\"; does that sound like Metallica or what?  <br />If you're new to Slayer, Reign In Blood (or maybe Seasons) is the obvious starting place but this is certainly an essential purchase for Slayer fans
0743455967|1.0|This was definitely the least informative book on writing I have ever read. I picked up a grand total of one tip, and that was so ordinary that I didn't bother writing it down when I gave the book away to a charity shop.
0698119347|5.0|This was one of my favorite books in years not even my favorite book the lord of the rings was as good as this.I think that most 10-12 year olds would enjoy this book especially if you liked watching James bond or secret agent books with crazy gadgets and incredible missions.I especially liked the parts were Alex was investigating his uncle's crashed car in the junkyard and the crane was taking the car to the compacter to become a metal cube with Alex still inside. <br /> <br />    Alex was my favorite character because he would do things that most kids wouldn't like risk his life for the country.It takes guts to go and face somebody who you know isn't gonna let you live if he figures who you work for and who you are.All in all  this book is great for teens,preteen and i recommend this book to anybody who likes secret missions. <br /> <br />
B00028HBL6|4.0|Although not fully accurate, this DVD was and still is an experience that can only be described by its viewing.  Based on MY understanding of the scriptures, it brought to light realistic, but still Hollywood modified, and graphic account of the last few hours of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  For those of us who, when reading the scriptures, can visualize events in our minds - this DVD my seem typical.  However, for those of us who have difficulty with visualizing when reading scriptures this DVD may help to serve as a guide. <br /> <br />All in all it was a good viewing and I would encourage others to watch it - ESPECIALLY Non-Christians and those wanting learn more about the grace that has been given to them.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Grand Guignol!  This low budget horror flick falls into that category - stories that are meant to horrify audiences.  And it succeeds, on many levels.  Written by Director James Wan and actor (in this film) Leigh Whannell, SAW drags us into the darkened sewer where Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) are chained to opposite sides of a filthy room, the centerpiece of which is a corpse recently dead by gunshot suicide.  Yet on this corpse is a tape recorder and after some otherworldly instructions, each man finds a tape on his person that gives instructions on how to take up the next hour and a half of grisly fantasy.<br /><br />It seems there are loonies out there whose sick minds seek retribution for being ignored or abused by the characters trapped in the sewer lounge.  Included in this m&eacute;lange are Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and his daughter, medical and patient personnel from Gordon's oncology practice, and two detectives (Danny Glover and Ken Leung) exploring a serial killer bent on have victims kill themselves in bizarrely medieval methods.  It now seems the good doctor and Adam are the latest players in the sicko's trail and how all this works out is a cat and mouse chase and pulse-pounding (?thudding) run to the finish.  No, giving away the ending would weaken the effect of the story, so leave that alone.  Just be ready to accept the fact that much is left unresolved, making it VERY obvious that we re in for SAW 2 sometime this year.<br /><br />If you love SEVEN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL, and other grisly shows, you'll love this little movie.  Despite its numerous flaws it does succeed in keeping you puzzled enough to overlook the bad acting.  And that is all you can ask from this genre!  Grady Harp, February 2005
B00025ETIW|5.0|Definately one of the best albums I've bought in a while. It's a great mix of everything. You'll like this CD if you like The Used, Thursday, or The Early November.
B0002OERI0|1.0|\\"American Idiot\\", eh?  Well, this American Patriot has seen enough.  One star.
6305089957|2.0|THAT WAS ENOUGH. I was actually expecting something out of this movie. I guess I was wrong. The final identity of the killer wasn't very surprising at all because it's not noticed that they are revealed somewhere in the middle of the film. I'm glad some of the people who died, died. {Many of them deserved it anyway}. I can't remember the plot, but it wasn't all that great to me. A few scenes were alright, but overall, this just does not make my day.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|\\"Shop 'til you drop\\" takes on literal form in \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", Splattermeister George Romero's 1978 magnum opus of the flesh-eating Living Dead. \\"Dawn\\" rightly deserves its title as the 'Mount Everest of Zombie Movies'.<br /><br />The Zombie Apocalypse is all George Romero's fault! And if Grandmaster Romero let the Walking Dead out of their tombs with the groundbreaking \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", he gave the zombies the keys to the kingdom in this flick, which laid down all the rules for a Zombie Apocalypse and how to survive It---and, interestingly, managed to break many of them.<br /><br />Rule #1: AIM FOR THE HEAD!: When \\"Dawn\\" opens up, Philadelphia is in its death throes, though the city doesn't know it yet.<br /><br />The plague of flesh-eating monsters rising from their graves to devour the living has spread from the countryside to the big cities like a firestorm. The slightest scratch or bite causes infection, the infected die horribly, and then return to Life, hungry for the flesh of the living, a mindless Zombie.<br /><br />Rule #2: THE CAVALRY AIN'T COMING. Things go down and go down hard in the housing project: faster than you can say \\"tastes like Chicken\\", SWAT troopers Peter (the great Ken Foree) and Roger (the underrated Scott Reiniger) get outta Dodge with traffic reporter/helicopter pilot Stephen (David Emge, hereafter known as \\"Flyboy\\") and Flyboy's girlfriend, Fran (Gaylen Ross).<br /><br />When the Going gets Tough, the Tough go Shopping.<br /><br />Rule #3:HE WHO GOES \\"YEEHAWW\\" HAS A HALF-LIFE MEASURED IN NANOSECONDS. Romero moves at a taut, brisk pace, letting the feeling of impending doom sink in, the sense of increasing wrongness, all underscored by the brooding, thudding, unearthly pulsing of the Goblin soundtrack.<br /><br />What's interesting about \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is just how much of a collaborative effort it really was: \\"Dawn\\" reprised the team that had helmed \\"Martin\\": Mike Gornick on the camera, Romero calling the shots, John Amplas (who played the young vampire Martin) running casting (and who gets gunned down as a rooftop gangsta in a quick cameo), and special spatter effects guru Tom Savini finally strutting his stuff (and getting in some quality screen time with a machete, to boot).<br /><br />Some have criticized Romero & Crew for lacking artistry in their cinematography, but think about it: \\"Dawn\\" was still a low-budget family affair, and Romero's best work has always had an edgy, guerilla feel. But the new print is gorgeous, and clear up any questions about Romero's genius: there is some beautiful stuff here.<br /><br />Take the scene with the helicopter lifting off against a dying Philadelphia skyline---with the lights in the floors of one skyscraper winking off, bottom to top, floor by floor. Or the nerve-jangling cat & mouse game between Flyboy and a zombie in a darkened engineering room. Or the sere beauty of a Mall parking lot overrun with the Dead hankering for that Blue-light special on human flesh, Aisle 9---all of this lends a brooding, sick, rotten atmosphere to \\"Dawn\\". It works in spades, and it's gorgeous, too.<br /><br />Rule #4: THEY'RE DEAD, THEY'RE ALL MESSED UP. Yes, Romero laid down the \\"Rules\\" of the Zombie apocalypse. They move at a lumbering crawl, you put `em down with a blow or bullet to the head, they don't use tools, they're deadly but stupid, they can't learn. Purists judge a remake, or any Zombie flick, according to the rules of the Romero canon.<br /><br />But take a look at \\"Dawn\\" and you'll find something interesting: Romero proceeds to violate---or toy with---nearly every rule about the Living Dead he put forth. You think turbo-zombies first showed up in \\"28 Days Later\\"? Not so: zombie kids in an abandoned airport charthouse charge at Ken Foree like they've got a Delorean in their tushses. Zombies can't use tools? Seems one of them finds a wrench very handy in breaking a truck window to take a chomp at Roger.<br /><br />Rule #5: NO GUTS, NO GLORY. If you love \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", you *must* pick up Anchor Bay's lovingly assembled \\"Ultimate Edition\\". First off, the print is gloriously restored: the colors are so intense and the picture so clear that \\"Dawn\\" looks like it could have been shot yesterday---long gone are the days of cheapo full-screen VHS copies that made early versions of \\"Dawn\\" look like porn.<br /><br />There are four DVDs, tricked out in red and black and handsomely mounted in a glossy package crammed with goodies (including the shot-for-shot comic---nothing special in itself, but a nice addition). You get commentaries with everyone, the original 'Making of' Documentary, a brand-new documentary made especially for this edition, even a creepy commercial for the Monroeville Mall.<br /><br />The real treasure trove here is the ability to watch all three versions of the movie: the original US theatrical cut (the best, in terms of pacing and atmosphere), the Extended version (featuring a tense and effective stand-off at the Phillie docks), and the shorter European version. It's intriguing to compare how editing and music can radically alter a film: in the Euro version, we have much more of Goblin's soundtrack---but everything feels off, not nearly packing as much punch.<br /><br />Rule #6:DON'T GET TRAPPED IN THE BASEMENT. Time has been kind to \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and George Romero; justly so. \\"Dawn\\" is a deliciously wicked little jewel of a movie, one I can watch over and over again. The consumerist angle, done to death my movie critics, is a little much: Romero filmed the flick in the Monroeville Mall because it was cheap, not because he was making a scathing commentary about American consumerism.<br /><br />Then again, maybe it is a movie about the extremes of Consumerism: the Zombies have risen again as the ultimate consumers, after all.<br /><br />They now consume our Flesh.<br /><br />JSGle #5: NO GUTS, NO GLORY. If you love \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", you *must* pick up Anchor Bay's lovingly assembled \\"Ultimate Edition\\". First off, the print is gloriously restored: the colors are so intense and the picture so clear that \\"Dawn\\" looks like it could have been shot yesterday---long gone are the days of cheapo full-screen VHS copies that made early versions of \\"Dawn\\" look like porn. <br /> <br />There are four DVDs, tricked out in red and black and handsomely mounted in a glossy package crammed with goodies (including the shot-for-shot comic---nothing special in itself, but a nice addition). You get commentaries with everyone, the original 'Making of' Documentary, a brand-new documentary made especially for this edition, even a creepy commercial for the Monroeville Mall. <br /> <br />The real treasure trove here is the ability to watch all three versions of the movie: the original US theatrical cut (the best, in terms of pacing and atmosphere), the Extended version (featuring a tense and effective stand-off at the Phillie docks), and the shorter European version. It's intriguing to compare how editing and music can radically alter a film: in the Euro version, we have much more of Goblin's soundtrack---but everything feels off, not nearly packing as much punch. <br /> <br />Rule #6:DON'T GET TRAPPED IN THE BASEMENT. Time has been kind to \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and George Romero; justly so. \\"Dawn\\" is a deliciously wicked little jewel of a movie, one I can watch over and over again. The consumerist angle, done to death my movie critics, is a little much: Romero filmed the flick in the Monroeville Mall because it was cheap, not because he was making a scathing commentary about American consumerism.  <br /> <br />Then again, maybe it is a movie about the extremes of Consumerism: the Zombies have risen again as the ultimate consumers, after all.  <br /> <br />They now consume our Flesh. <br /> <br />JSG
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Great flick. Marginally disturbing.  <br />Original. Never been done before. And done well.  <br />If you like this genre - this is a must-see. One of the best endings ever. Ever. Check it out.
B00006879E|1.0|How on earth can you give this bland recording 5 Stars? <br /> <br />Five stars is for Dark Side of the Moon, Electric Ladyland, <br />Led Zeppelin III, Radiohead - Ok Computer, Tool - Aenima etc.. <br /> <br />Not this nonsense...five stars this is not.... <br /> <br />If you think this is good, then go and listen to anything  <br />Stevie Wonder has done and you will think Jesus has come back <br />and handed you music.... :) <br /> <br />These guys just rip Stevie off....and they do it poorly... <br /> <br />Branch out, oh poor brainwashed by the industry listener and find something that isnt being shoved down your throat by radio, Mtv or whatever else...! <br /> <br />This album is proof that the Grammys' mean nothing anymore...its almost just a showcase for what \\"The Man\\" is telling you to buy. <br /> <br />Here's a test, and remember this now....in 10 years ask someone who maroon five is and I bet they are a distant memory or completely forgotton <br /> <br />
B000002540|5.0|Blue Oyster Cult recorded \\"On Your Feet...\\" at a time when they were selling out venues all over the world without the benefit of a hit single anywhere. A raw sounding record with NO OVERDUBS shows the rabidness of the band and gives a wicked slice of their first few releases with a couple cover songs thrown in, to boot. Speaking about sonics, this album will not impress you at first especially if your under the age 25, but give it a further listen a realize the time it was (I'm not saying its a badly recorded album, it just sounds like a mid 70s live album). \\"Then came the Last Days of May\\" features killer Buck Dharma solos, and is one of the coolest songs of the era, and the band's re-working of the Yardbirds \\"I aint got You\\" is also very good rock. This is the band before \\"Don't fear The Reaper\\" was released and before their style began to progress to a more adult-oriented rock and roll. But it's all good, and it's all cranked to high volume. A good lost classic for any collectors of landmark musical recordings. An interesting piece of history from an american metal band amongst a sea of British metal gods. An album worthy of the landmark title and should be on the tip of tongues of metal-heads everywhere like Led Zeppelin, and Black Sabbath is today. Blue Oyster Cult took a back seat to NO metal band of ANY era they just progressed beyond the (for lack of a better phrase) the teenage genre. Check it out.
B000028U0Y|5.0|His voice is rough, there are technical, and performance glitches throughout, and this is one of the truly great experiences in popular music. Listening to this recording of Cash in front of an emotional, enthusiastic, and more than a little bit scary audience (Listen to the cheers any time violence is presented in a song.)is a visceral experience. You can feel the tension in the air as Cash dances on the edge, showing solidarity with his audience, while keeping them totally enthralled. He makes everything work, the powerful \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" kick things off, but even throwaway pieces like \\"Dirty Old Egg-Suckin' Dog\\" and \\"Flushed from The Bathroom of Your Heart\\" ; songs that wouldn't work well in any other venue are fitting here, ways to defuse the crowd and lighten the mood. This is what a concert album should be: a real emotional rollercoaster, a true expression of what a great artist can do for his audience.
0671027387|2.0|This is the second book I read from Brown and it feels like we are about to get a book factory. Even though the book is a nice read, far away from being boring it leaves you plain after you finish it. It feels like eating fast food - feels good while you are eating, and then dull when you are finished. The only way how to get rid of this feeling is to get another book from Brown and read it. The problem might happen if you finish all four before he writes fifth.<br /><br />To be a bit more specific, what I really don't like about this book is that so many technical facts are either irrelevant, or not accurate. And this can be very annoying if you know even a little bit of engineering. However, what I like about it is that it take so little to finish reading it...and then another BROWN can be taken for read.
0671891634|2.0|I wrote this review in the hope that you'll avoid the mistake I made. <br /> <br />I bought (and read) in reverse chronological order the first two books Mr. Peter Lynch wrote, \\"One Up On Wall Street\\" and \\"Beating The Street\\". I got \\"Beating The Street\\" before \\"One Up\\" because I have been misled by a favourable review of this book made by a well-known financial internet site (maybe they make money out of every book they help to sell?).  <br /> <br />Imagine you have written an excellent book and you have sold one million copies of it. What would you do after that? Would your publisher push you to write another one? Wouldn't you write again to try and repeat the success? <br />I think this is what happened to Mr. Lynch. He wrote \\"One Up On Wall Street\\", which is an excellent book indeed (I published a few weeks ago a review of this book, where I explain why I warmly recommend it) and he sold over one million copies of it. <br />\\"Beating The Street\\" is, I presume, an attempt to profit from the success of the first book. <br />Problem is, \\"One Up\\" is a masterpiece: it explains very well Mr. Lynch's proven investing philosophy and methods. If so, what else to publish in a later book? <br /> <br />While \\"One Up\\" is a book that explains and recommends strategies, i.e. tells how to successfully pick winning stocks, \\"Beating The Street\\" is actually a book that picks stocks for you. <br />Remember, this book has been published in 1993. I believe it is easy to understand that, after so many years, the then cheaply valued companies recommended by Mr. Lynch may be fairly valued, overvalued, no longer in business, or taken private by now. <br /> <br />In my opinion, \\"Beating The Street\\" is now a poor and completely out of date book. <br /> <br />Here's an excerpt (from page 206 - ISBN 0-671-89163-4): <br />\\"I talked to Glacier (Bancorp) the day after Christmas. I'd come into my office in Boston wearing plaid pants and a sweatshirt. The building was empty except for me and the security guard. <br />(...) whoever answered the phone at Glacier Bancorp in Kalispell told me they were having a retirement party for one of the officers, but they'd inform chairman Charles Mercord that I called. They must have dragged him out of the party, because a few minutes later Mercord called me back. <br />Asking a president or a CEO about a company's earnings is a ticklish proposition. You're not going to get anywhere by blurting out, 'What are you going to earn next year?' First you have to establish rapport. We chatted about the mountains.(...) <br />My only worry was that Glacier may have overpaid for its acquisition, a topic I approached obliquely. 'I assume you had to pay over book value for this,' I said, inviting Glacier's president to admit the worst. But no, Glacier hadn't overpaid. <br />(...) I never hang up on a source without asking: what other companies do you most admire? (...) I've found many good stocks this way.\\" <br /> <br />Well, apart that the well-known SEC-enforced \\"Regulation Full Disclosure\\" (Reg FD - not existent at the time Mr. Lynch wrote his book) now forbids analysts to talk privately about business matters with companies' officials, I'm not sure any of you would be able to pick up the telephone and have a nice conversation the day after Christmas with any CEOs, wouldn't you? <br />I estimated that, if every buyer of those one million copies \\"One Up\\" sold were to call Glacier Bancorp, the CEO would have to spend over nine years talking to the telephone (one million 5-minutes calls, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year...). <br /> <br />Save your money and get \\"One Up On Wall Street\\" instead.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I want the time I spent watching this film back please!!!
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Someone does something INNOVATIVE in movies! Just imagine...those great Alex Raymond-drawn Flash Gordon strips of the forties and thirties come to life in full art deco regalia, aesthetics absolutely perfectly replicated in 3 dimensions, with the perfect casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as a Lois Lane-type reporter, Giovannia Ribisi as Mr. Gadgets and Mr. Matinee Idol himself, Jude Law, as the hero, and you have \\"Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow\\"...a film I KNEW was going to be groundbreaking when it was in the promo stage.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that is a perfect marriage of major league visuals and suitable acting, and, \\"Gladiator\\" aside, is the one film that makes PERFECT use of CGI technology! The entire film was done against a bluescreen, with very few real-world props! There have been other reviews of this film decrying the wooden acting of those involved, but you have to remember that 1) Acting WITH real-world references isn't easy, and 2) These actors were doing their thing WITHOUT real-world references, something I've always appreciated about a good sci-fi or fantasy movie...<br /><br />The story concerns the classic megalomaniacal villain scenario of a mad, but brilliant scientist who has misused his gift to satisfy his own outsized paranoia. Laurence Olivier is digitally resurrected to play the computer generated persona of this man, a Dr. \\"Totenkopf\\", (done VERY \\"Wizard of Oz\\",) who has gone about sending his mechanical minions to sap energy from large cities whilst destroying same to build an ark that will preserve life and humanity offworld as the Earth descends into mayhem that he is at least partially responsible for.<br /><br />To say that the visuals are mind-boggling would be an understatement....the visuals are easily the equal of any of the earlier \\"Star Wars\\" films and the last fifteen minutes of the film are worth the price of admission. Jude Law is a capable hero as Sky Captain Joe Sullivan, but it's Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, a blonde xeroxing of good old Lois Lane, that steals the movie from him! She makes all the mistakes a normal person would make in the movie...inadvertently giving away their presence when they try to stealthily sabotage Totenkopf's lair; not having enough film to capture some of the most incredible, newsworthy tableau a journalist has ever laid eyes on, and doing some of the worst backseat driving since Lucille Ball! The banter between her and Sullivan is straight out of a Bogart and Bacall movie.<br /><br />Some of the actors in the film that portray the scientists that Totenkopf is either killing off or forcing to work for him from the grave, (he managed to infuse his persona in his vast array of computer and broadcasting circuits at his lair,) are truly convincing as meek, put-upon scientists running for their lives from a supposedly dead madman. However, they seem to be very self-involved about it, not really caring that the world at large is in danger as well.<br /><br />Complex and entertaining, \\"Sky Captain\\" was perhaps the most underrated film of 2004, and the only one I saw fit to see in the theater. You better believe I had to have it on DVD....!<br /><br />The ending is very cute, btw.<br /><br />By all means, GET IT!good old Lois Lane, that steals the movie from him!

B00064MW6A|1.0|I must admit that the movie had a good plot and there's no doubt that Halle Berry looks good in the outfit.  After that, it pretty much went downhill.   <br /> <br />I'm not knocking special effects in general, but there is a point where too much is too much.  And the ones used to simulate her movement were just too much.  Crawling all over the walls?  Last time I checked, cats do not possess that particular ability.  Her debut in the jewelry store was hilarious.  We couldn't stop laughing ... and I don't think that's what the director had in mind. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a film with a good looking woman in a skimpy costume or enjoy making fun of movies then you'll be happy with this.  Otherwise I would recommend passing this one up.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Once again Opeth has managed to deliver and bring forth an amazing album despite the fact that its missing the growling vocals and distorted guitars. However, this cd is just as enjoyable and still contains the brilliant songwriting that I have grown to love from each release. Every song is excellent and most have an eerie mood to them. Overall this is one cd that you must get if you are a fan of Opeth and don't be turned off just because they went with a more mellow approach on here.
B0006GAOBI|2.0|Donnie Darko is one of may favorite movies so I was very excited to watch The Director's Cut version and anxious to hear what writer/director Richard Kelly had to say about his amazing movie. It was disappointing to say the least and I do not recommend buying it unless you are a die-hard fan of the film.  If you have not seen the film SEE THE ORIGINAL FIRST (at least twice)     After watching the director's cut, I have come to the realization that Richard Kelly was the victim of the rare \\"hollywood first timer's luck syndrome\\", where a writer's first big movie turns out to be spectacular, despite his or her best efforts.  Another past sufferer of this rare affliction was Bryan Singer (the writer/director of The Usual Suspects).      The theatrical release of Donnie Darko was a rare cinematic gem. Mysterious and thought-provoking because it left so much to be interpreted by the viewer.  All at once it was a film about love, sacrifice, God, time travel, insanity and the supernatural (at least to me it was.  Others feel differently and that is why the movie was so great).  After watching the director's cut of the film I realized that, had Mr. Kelly had his way, the film would have ended up as a simple scifi flick about multiple dimensions and time travel to save the world.    In the director's cut, much of the subtelty is gone.  We are allowed to see the pages of the time travel book, which explain what is about to happen in the next scenes in case (god forbid) the audience is puzzled.  Donnie and his psychiatrist blatantly discuss Atheism and the search for God. The perfect, sharp comedy of the Jim Cunningham school assembly scene now drags on and on. The final flashback scene becomes an industrial, robotic construct and loses all of its emotional impact because there is now a grid and computer text scrolling across the screen.    Most of these changes were in the original cut of the film but Mr. Kelly was forced to remove them because of time constraints. Now that hecan have his way, the movie shows too much and is reduced to a simple story about a \\"chosen one\\" who must save the world.    The most disappointing feature of this DVD is the much anticipated, yet absolutely worthless commentary track for the film.  In it, writer/director Richard Kelly and his buddy ramble endlessley and joke with each other about topics completeley unrelated to what is going on on-screen.  I was so angry that I had to stop the commentary.  The first ten minutes of the commentary track are spent discussing whether or not the writer of The Breakfast Club liked to listen to music while he was writing.  Meanwhile, priceless scenes go by without any attention paid.     Donnie Darko, The Director's Cut is an opportunity wasted.    PS - The last straw for me in this director's cut was the changing of the dialogue in the scene where Drew Barrymore gets fired and the deletion of the perfect and classic \\"Get off the stage Cherita\\" line during the talent show.
B000003TA4|1.0|Kurt Cobain's position of sacrosanct in groups of pseudo intellectual, pseudo rebel, monolinguistic, ignorant and immature POSEURS is one of this things that makes me feel sad for the majority of his fans. <br /> <br />Don't bother about discussing. If his music was good or bad. That doesn't matter. \\"Nevermind\\" is a normally weak and simple album. With some strange lyrics that he wrote while being on drugs and some ridiculous \\"anti-social\\" lyrics about teenagers (\\"Smell like teens Spirit\\") and about fashion (\\"In Bloom\\"). All this, accompanied with his appearance that made him a good media character, the musical theory stolen form Soundgarden and helped by the lack of interest that people had in the stupidity of the hair bands, made people think \\"he's expressing his feelings\\", and here you have it. \\"Nevermind\\". The most overrated album in the history of the art known as music. <br />But all that doesn't matter. What matters is the wave of fifth class contemporary pseudo nihilism that his death created. Having met a considerable big number of pathetically inept mediocrities of all classes that furiously write the name of Nirvana in their bookbags and/or that defend Cobain as being \\"a hero\\", I consider myself a person with the enough authority to write a review about Nirvana and the terrible effect that this one provoked among the young Americans. It is incredible that Cobain, with a bad guitar work, simple catchy tunes, bad voice and acting like buffoon, was able to change, in a negative form, the idiosyncracy of so many people. Shame on the human being that leaves an ant affect his/her life and/or his/her virtue and/or his/her faith and/or his/her reason. The predictably disguising garbage that emanates from the mouths of Cobain's biggest fans has no chance of becoming relevant ideas. Forget about the fact that if he wouldn't ve been a good looking man, he wouldn't be 1/10 of what he is today. Forget about the fact that Grunge was a fashion for the weak minds. Forgetabout that. Just keep in mind that the morons keep the teenybooper inside and that's why Cobain is still a hero.  <br />Nihilist? If you are retarded, then yes, Cobain was a Nihilist. Not the kind of Nihilist whose non-rational philosophy of Will takes him/her to levels of self esteem. No, not that kind of Nihilist. Cobain was the type of Nihilist that dressed differently and acted differently. Like an immature moron. <br /> <br />Nirvana will stay as one of the most popular acts for many years to come, but, those apes that worship Cobain will stay in the hole in which they are now.  <br />One of the best parts of finishing High School last year was stop seeing the clowns that see Cobain as the messiah. Good for me, bad for them. <br /> <br />\\"Every person takes the limits of their own field of vision for the limits of the world.\\" <br />--Arthur Schopenhauer.
B000003TAL|5.0|This is by far Sonic Youth's best album. When I first heard this album, I was a 14 year old punk, and the swirling, abrasive noise was like nothing I'd ever heard. It's hard for me to describe this album in an objective way, but it deserved all the hype in 1988 and it deserves your attention now.
B000003BEV|5.0|What is going on here? Don't any of you fools understand anything? What are you dim-wits like in real life? This album was NOT an attempt to emulate Sgt. Pepper's, you fools! They're poking fun at it, and the BEATLES and the rest of you dorks who don;t know anything!!
0393324818|4.0|Michale Lewis talks about how Oakland A's trump the biggest and best in baseball with their 'profit on the cheap' business strategy. Year-in and year-out, they get into playoffs with a $40 million payroll and compete w/ the Yankess (payroll $170+).  <br /> <br />The ability of Billy Beane and his team (esp Paul Podesta) to hand pick 'low-end' players on the cheap, and win enuff to make A's profitable is a truly memorable story. <br /> <br />It gets deep into baseball statistics and history, but from a bird's eye view, it's more about running a business with a smart strategy (instead of following the lead of the big kahunas). <br /> <br />Recommend it more as a business guide than as a baseball story. But, if you love baseball (or any sport), it's a bigger bonus :) <br /> <br />Have read his one other book - The New New Game. And, it was  <br />fantastic. <br /> <br />This book deserves a thumbs up from me.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Is this simply a story of revenge? Is it just sword fighting and killing? <br />I've seen this film many times and it's never the action or the gore that moves me; it is always the story. It is always the emotional component that shines through.  <br /> <br />A close friend of mine is an atheist. He doesn't believe in God, Heaven, Hell, or an afterlife. Nothing. He confided in me that the ending of this film always makes him weep. Knowing what I know about his beliefs, I asked him why. He twisted and turned and tried to get out of answering the question, but I kept after him. Eventually I let it go, but I never stopped thinking about it.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, what my friend never wanted to admit to is this: In the end, this movie made him believe. <br />James Green, author of \\"If There's One Thing I've Learned.\\"
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is without a doubt one of Scott's best films. Crowe is a born star, and the cinematography is outstanding. The only historical film I enjoyed more than this is Braveheart.
B00020HEL6|5.0|First time, I listen her I fell in love with her voice, what a voice!!!. I like all songs in this album, in my view, almost perfect. Buy her album. Don't miss it and enjoy.
0385513755|5.0|A dear friend gave me Dan Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" for Christmas last year. He said it was such an interesting read, and was sure I would love it. I started reading the book Thursday morning on the train, got completely hooked after a few pages, and finished it in a few long sittings over the weekend.<br /><br />In short, the protagonist Robert Langdon, Harvard symbologist, is in Paris for work. Late one night at the hotel, he receives a phone call. It is the police, informing him that Monsieur Jacques Sauniere, the curator of the Louvre Museum have been murdered. Monsieur Sauniere was murdered inside the museum, and before he died, he left a bizarre, coded message. Robert Landon and a young female French cryptologist, Madame Sophie Neveu, have been called to the crime scene to assist the police.... of course, everyone involved have skeletons in the closet, nothing is as it seems to be, but I'll leave it there, so I don't spoil the fun for you.<br /><br />\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is not great writing. No one will use the same superlatives for Brown's prose as they would use for Hemingway's. Further, Brown may have presented historical events in this book as facts when it is fiction, and some of the facts presented are just plain incorrect. Anyway, all this is really beside the point ! It doesn't matter....<br /><br />The one thing you cannot challenge is that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is hugely entertaining ! This was a great, riveting story.  I loved it ! I highly recommend it !!<br /><br />On a personal note, I have the stunning Collector's edition. It is a beautiful, beautiful book. It makes the reading much more interesting as you have great pictures of all the buildings, places, people, and the magnificent paintings mentioned in the book. If you can afford it, buy the illustrated version !<br /><br />PS. My friend was recently in Paris. He  told me that the Louvre Museum now offers \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" - tours ! ... so, that's what I'll be doing next time I'm in Paris !
B00070Q7VO|5.0|For me, this man always gives pleasure and relax feeling and warm atmosphere, overall, I enjoy listening this album. Listen his duet with Nelly: \\"quando quando quando\\", timeless. Beatles' song \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", nice arrangement. Also perfect collaboration with Chris Botti \\"Song For U\\". Recommended, don't hesitate to buy this album when you are in audio stores. Again, nice job michael.
B00062IVKS|4.0|A 1999 reviewer lamented/contended that the \\"widescreen\\" version was \\"phony\\" (i.e. that MGM just cropped the top&bottom off the standard TV format to appear as faux-widescreen). The 2005 DVDs use the same box artwork for both the excellent 2-disc Special Edition and the single disc (film-only) box. But is the 2005 1-disc Raging Bull a TRUE (theatrical)widescreen, or just a re-boxing of the old \\"widescreen\\"?
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie is proof positive that the gene pool needs a lot of chlorine. Napolean Dynamite - wow, what a pile. All of the characters in this movie (as well as the director) are the reason abortion is still kept legal. People, do the planet a favor and go play in traffic. There isn't much I could say that hasn't already been written by other reviewers, but coming from a guy who owns over 600 titles on DVD, I regret even watching someone else's copy. I am in an occupation that winds up seeing a substantial amount of movies, and am very disappointed to have painfully sat through this humorless, mindless epic. As for the podunk Idaho town that it represented, I'm sure the residents are now embarrased to have to admit that's where they're from - if not, maybe that would be a good place to start testing nuclear weapons. Everyone needs a good bomb range, right? Again, this movie is proof positive that the gene pool needs A LOT of chlorine. <br />
B0006J28L4|3.0|I bought this title over again as I had already owned the original disc.  I also owned a Superbit \\"Lawrence or Arabia,\\" but quickly sold it due to the fact that it was spread out over two discs.  Malcolm X (2005) for some reason is spread out over two discs!  Why?  I thought that since this was a two-disc set, it would have meant that bonus materials were on one disc and the film on the other.  Noooo, they put bonus materials on one disc and some on the other!  This spreading a film over two disc is one of the reasons I did not like the laserdisc. <br /> <br />The film itself was remastered, although the original disc was excellent in picture quality for an earlier DVD disc.  The remsatering is similar to the Star Wars DVD.  You can see the weaves of clothing material type of detail.  You can now see film grain, if you like that! <br /> <br />The best addition was the 1972 documentary of the real Malcolm X.  You get to see extended views of certain sittuations and his murder along with public reaction on the scene!  That alone is the main reason I bought the new one.  You also get to see his casket for extended periods.  I just wonder why I have not seen footage of the actual assasination since you have the before and after. <br /> <br />If this thing was not split over two discs, I would have given it a five. <br /> <br />
B000002AS3|5.0|I was fortunate enough to pick up on this when it was pretty new, and have enjoyed it since then.  I preferred Oasis music to alot of the grunge stuff that was happening at the time. One of those albums that you just don't get tired of.  I have every Oasis album and will look forward to more. Great band.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|I had the origianl disc.  It seems that not many were buying that one at the time.  It also seemed as if not many had DVD players either.   <br /> <br />I watched this alot on DVD(origianl).  When this new one came out, I did not buy it because I already had it.  I knew that it needed remastering bad.  I did not know how bad until I watched on a HDTV!  Like \\"Strange Days,\\" the original \\"Scarface\\" was encoded in the wrong way.  On an HDTV, you have to resize it to fill the screen.  That is the reason I decided to purchase this newer version. <br /> <br />Without telling the story, this version has encoded the disc correctly.  Qulaity wise, there does not seem to be much difference between this and the old one.  This one has taken the very strong film grain of the original out.  It has been replaced be a smoother picture at the expense of some detail.  I guess this may be good.  The strong film grain was really noticable on a SDTV.  If you have to get it, of course get this one.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|No matter how much you look for a comparative band, you won't find it. With a certain resemblance to Flaming Lips, White Stripes, Interpol or Franz Ferdinand, depending on what song you're listening to, Montreal-based Arcade Fire is without a doubt the best debut of 2004 and one of the best new bands to come around in the past few years (perhaps alongside M83).<br /><br />In spite of the obscure title of their debut album and the dark opening bars of most songs, do not be fooled. This is no sad of downer of an album. \\"Funeral\\" embraces being human, with its share of life and death (with the passing of several close relatives of the bandmembers in the months and years prior to the album production), having a good time, looking at sad things and carrying on... which is perfectly conveyed in just about every song. Most of the tracks open with a slow pace or in a harsher tone, eventually reaching a climax, past which you find yourself feeling transformed and elevated.<br /><br />Like big parentheses, the evocative first and last two songs serve as a perfect frame to the best there is in Arcade Fire's treasure chest. Sung in both English and French, \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" is simply the most beautiful song in the album. Incredibly moving too are \\"Power Out\\" and \\"Wake Up\\". With solid, non-commercial instrumentation and lyrics beyond the trivial, quite simply, I don't see \\"Funeral\\" ever going under, but rather turning into a classic for the ages.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|There are so Many Thriller Movies out there today that it is hard to Distinguish One From Another! This is Not the case with SAW!FINALLY a Thriller that Really DELIVERS! Many People have Compared this Film To Seven. While I agree with that Assessment, I feel that Saw takes it up a notch and is even better than Seven.One Of The Strongest Points in this Film is that it isnt a Star Driven Movie, the biggest names in this Film are Danny Glover and Cary Elwes but the main Star of the Film is The Excellent Screenplay and the Mood that the Director sets. This Film is a Roller Coaster Ride From Start To Finish and the ending will Blow You Away, Trust Me, You Will NOT have Seen this Ending Coming. I dont want to go into details about the film because I dont want to give anything away but this Film is Well Worth Seeing! One Of The Best Thriller Films in years!
B0007OY2MG|5.0|This mother-daughter team will not only warm your hearts but knock your socks off.  The characters, the chemistry between them, and the comedic speech are all brilliantly developed to make a great tv show.  Each episode is like a hidden gem with enough cultural puns to make you dizzy.  See if you can keep up with the Gilmore Girls--buy season 3!
B00006EXL5|2.0|After going through it, nothing really strikes me personally. It blends together after a while. First track \\"Romance\\" with its static... it if was a metaphor then it was lost on me.  <br /> <br />The tracks \\"Helena\\" and \\"I'm not okay\\" on the last album brought me to this one, but I'm not into this at all. <br /> <br />Each to his own I guess.
0316776963|5.0|As usual, David Sedaris has written a collection of personal essays that are downright hilarious.  I read this book cover to cover last night and am still laughing the next day any time I think about it.  The first part of the book features essays dealing with his childhood experiences and his colorful, occasionally dysfunctional family (if you haven't, also read Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim for more on the Sedaris family--especially his gruff, often belligerent and always foulmouthed brother).  The second part covers the author's early visits to and life in France--his borderline sadistic French teacher, the joy of watching American movies in Paris, and (the best essay in the book) riding the metro with American tourists.   <br />All in all, this is a great book that will put you in a good mood and keep you laughing.
B0001US8FI|5.0|As a Bruce Lee's fan since childhood,i'm really glad to see this special anniversary edition dvd... reason being it contained two of the best bruce lee's documentries ever released... hw else will u describe \\"bruce lee: a warrior journey\\", \\"bruce lee: curse of the dragon\\" ....The former have to be the most exciting bruce lee's documentry ever as it included the unseen footage of \\"Game of Death\\" as it should be seen!!!(G.O.D, the 70's movie is a big insult to bruce lee, hated it to the core, nw i don't have to endure it juz to see the pagoda scenes) seeing these footage made me felt like i was watching a new bruce's movie!!! Thank God for John Little....  <br /> <br />For the other bonus materials, i recommended the \\"enter the dragon\\" featurette as it showed hw the movie came about with rare footages of the sets and fliming process... the documentry \\"blood and steel: making of enter the dragon\\" pales in comparison.... the tv spots, theatrical trailers are also very entertaining as it provided a peek as to hw this movie was promoted back then in the 70's....  <br /> <br />Lastly for the movie, i felt tt \\"enter the dragon\\" is the most accessible bruce lee's movie for the non-asian crowd... reasons being the James Bond-like scenes, the inclusion of John Saxon n Jim Kelly along with Bruce to form a trio of adventurers n the magnificent sets made the flim looked more like a Hollywood action thriller than a Hong Kong kung fu movie (tt's the intention of Warner Bros obviously... though it's a US-HK co-production)... but if u really want to see the glory of bruce's, i recommended \\"Way of the Dragon\\" (aka \\"Return of the Dragon\\" in the US), which bruce produced, directed and acted.... n who can forget the fantastic coliuseum finale where bruce duel with Chuck Norris? <br /> <br />In conclusion, this special anniversary edition of \\"enter the dragon\\" is a steal... with all the great bonus materials which caused me to spend days watching (at least 3 of the documentries r 90mins and above)... even if u r not a bruce lee fan, u should buy it due to the above reason alone.... as for bruce lee's fan, this will be the most valuable piece in your bruce lee's dvds collection yet....
B00005QG9J|5.0|incubus has been my fave band for years, and morning veiw is my fave album. the sound is much different from thier previous CDs but is similar to that of A crow left of the murder. i enjoy the poetic lyrics and the touch of DJ in the music. a perfectly mixed disc, and one of my all time faves.
B0006GAOCW|3.0|The story was quite interesting.  There were a few twists in the story.  The story is that the \\"first daughter\\" goes to college at an unnamed school on the west coast (it's filmed on the beautiful UCLA Westwood campus).  The first daughter wants nothing more than to have a typical, normal life.  That is not exactly obtainable, however:  the Secret Service agents make having a reasonable life, difficult, if not impossible.  As a result, the first daughter takes affirmative steps to normalize her life, unaware that she is still within the protective cover of the secret service.  The twist is that she falls in love with a secret service -- although she is unaware of it at the time.  That's one of the best parts in the movie.  Overall, Katie Holmes is not the best actress, and it is plausible that someone else could have played her part better.<br /><br />--Michael
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This is one of those rare movies that hooks you from the very beginning and holds you until the very end. From the opening scene of two strangers chained up in a dingy old bathroom to the surprise ending and the identity of the 'Jigsaw Killer' being revealed. I was disappointed in the lack of special features (a 2 minute 30 second feature on the making of Saw, as well as censored/uncensored versions of a Fear Factory music video). This movie is not your a-typical horror/thriller movie. This movie stands alone by itself as a classic, and shows what lengths we will go to to survive.
B000002A3T|5.0|I have a story to share about this album. Maybe its not important to the majority who will read it, but it impacted my life in ways I still can't understand or discribe. I was 15 years old when I heard this album for the first time - to be honest, its the first time I remember every hearing Pink Floyd at all. I was at a guy's house (who I've now been with for 6 years) and I was just meeting him for the first time through a friend. He had this album on repeat and it was surround sound in his then garage bedroom. We talked for almost 3 hours straight with this album playing in the background and Christmas tree lights flashing in sequence with the music. It was a magical night, and I know no other way to discribe it. I was connecting with someone in a way I never had before, and this album helped expidite that reality. Since then, I call this album the bond that keeps me and my now (unfortunalty) long-distance love connected. When I get frustrated with the situation, I put in this album and then I remember why he is so special to me. The first thing he ever gave me was his copy of the Division Bell. This album brews love, passion and intense understanding. Some say its too \\"slow\\"... I say it's just mellow enough. Some say its not \\"Pink Floydish\\" I say, it speaks volumes of what Gilmour has accomplished through Pink Floyd, some say nothing compares to Dark Side and The Wall... I say, The Division Bell compares and is better. When I want to relax, I put this album on. When I want to have a good cry, I put this album on. When I want to remember, I put this album on - it's that damn good. And don't you forget - \\"She could take it back, someday\\".
B0006SSOHC|1.0|This is the perfect example of Hollywood's inability to no longer generate an original thought. This is just a culmination of 12 other movies, one that was good, some that were mediocre, some that were, well, not so good, but the end result is one of the worst movies ever made, it sucked. First off the whole feeling of the film is of one of those low budget, straight to video, serial killer, B movies. The lighting, anywhere else but the bathroom sucked, the acting was below par and frankly sucked, the short 45 sec. car chase scene, was one of the cheapest, cheesiest scenes I've ever seen in my entire life and frankly the editor and the director should be ashamed for having it in the finished product. I mean, just because you shoot a guy in a car with high speed film and make them move around so the finished product is herky jerky and chaotic looking, does not mean that its a cheaper alternative thats just as good, it in fact means that you've achieved to project yet another B grade effect, lending an amateurish prose for your film.  The only reason that I gave this movie even a star, was because it does have a surprise ending. Not a thought provoking one like Se7en, which is thought invoking on many moral and ambiguous levels (which I think this director really tried to unsuccessfully imulate), no its just one of those endings where you go, \\"Oh,\\" and move one with your life and don't give it another thought, unless your retarded and in which case you'll still be talking about it a week after you saw it (in which case you'll inadvertantly talk thousands of intelligent people into watching this (...). This film not only took 2 hours of my life that I will never get back, along with my $3.50 it took to rent it, it also took several IQ points that I would very much like to get back. Now there's an idea for a movie, retarded hollywood directors make crappy films to suck IQ points from viewers, it could be a documentary, not a fictional account, 'cause its happening rightnow!!!   I really can't tell you why I even picked this up off the shelf at rental place. Guess I just wanted a little escapism. Well I didn't even get that. But I'll tell you what I did get, one lame ass movie.
0316172324|2.0|The concepts described in the book could easily git a single chapter or be summarized in a magazine article. Thin-slicing is a concept researched by author, where the humans frequently make decisions based on the first impression, and sometimes those decisions tend to be correct right away, sometimes they are totally wrong. It's the book about gut felling and horse sense with some academic research supplied by the author. <br /> <br />But right as you are about comforted with the fact that you bought a book that is a bit scientific and enriching, the author moves on to tell how how racist your sorry ass is, and how you're subconsciously biased against black people, and how you should watch Olympic games and listen to Colin Powell to get rid of that bias. <br /> <br />The point is well made, but Gladwell goes at it at length, like a senile Grandpa at retirement home starting with his war stories and never knowing when to stop. Gladwell is repetitive, often redundant and way too verbose. For simple concepts that he's describing, he could've easily written a book with 5% of the pages that \\"Blink\\" has and still make a point. You wish you could smack him on the head and say \\"Enough! I got you. Move on, please\\" throughout the chapters.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Saw is a good movie. It's suspenseful, gory, and keeps your attention. At the end you'll be wondering what happened, and will have to rewind. The only thing is that it doesnt fully live up to its hype.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Ok Ill give it to these guys, they make some pretty catchy tunes like Boulevard and Time of your Life. But lets face it...Their music can be played by any musician and when I say ANY musician I mean it. I started teaching my little brother guitar three months ago and he can already play every Greenday song the way it was originally written. Come on guys, catchy but not talented. If you think otherwise you know nothing about music.
B0000029GA|5.0|You shouldnt even need to read a review for this album, the title of the album has now became proper nomenclature  for a classic album....10 tracks.....10 Classic hits
B00005JK8K|5.0|Okay, it's not a five star movie and I am giving it 5 to make up for the folks who gave it only one. I was skeptical of the movie and it got a mite predictable as it went along, but it was a good, read above average action flick with some minor social messages, and one of N. Cage's better performances. I say 3 and three quarters stars would be a fair rating for this movie. Worth seeing.
B000023VR6|5.0|2001 stands as the turning point in hip-hop as it moved into the next millennium.  At the time there had been a huge void left by the 2Pac & Biggie repercussions and the brief Puff Daddy era.  If you look back now, no one really new the direction hip-hop was uncertain.  While some may say that hip-hop is dead, (besides the underground scene) you can probably thank Dre and this album for any kind of dignity the music still has left.     Just as the Chronic was so monumental, 2001 did this same for its era.  Think about all the things this album did: re-established Dre as hip-hop's best producer; saved Snoop & Nate Dogg's dying careers; put Eminem, Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, Devin The Dude, & producer Scott Storch (check the album credits) on the map (sure some of them had a career, but this album is were they blew up); and it gave the West Coast a voice again.   Sure it failed to jump-start Kurupt's career and Hitman... but it at least gave them the opportunity.  Finally, just look at the rap scene right now with the impact of Aftermath/Shady and all the other influences from this album.  It's easy to say in hindsight the impact of 2001 was massive.     Dre leads the album with the immortal words \\"Things just ain't the same for gangstas...\\"  \\"The Watcher\\" is an excellent start to this album; Dre makes a statement from the beginning of how on point he is both lyrically and production wise.  He laments on just how much the game has changed, and throws in a great chorus.  Throughout the album, Dre has a much more `grown-man' attitude than everyone else featured, and it's more than appropriate.  If Dre carrying on like Hittman or Em, it would just sound silly and fake.  Instead he comes off great every time.    \\"F*** You\\" is just plain raunchy.  Devin's chorus & verse are the best part of the song.  Chances are this will be too much for some people, but then again how much more ridiculous is rap now these days?? The g-funk synthesizer really brings it all together.    Is it even worth describing how sick \\"Still D.R.E.\\" is? Sure Jay-Z wrote the lyrics (just check the mysterious `S. Carter' credit in the liner notes), but the song is so good you should care less.  Dre and Storch work the piano masterfully.    \\"Big Ego's\\" is more a less a shoot out tale that showcases Hittman.  With some nice pounding piano's, solid verses from Dre & Hittmann.  \\"Xxplosive\\" has got to be one of the best smoker-beats ever and xylophone in the background is like icing on the cake.  Sure Kurupt's verse gets a little tiresome at its end, but it's absolutely great when Nate gets a chance to shine.  Just when you think he's gonna stop he goes classic with some \\"Ain't No Fun\\" type crooning.  It's guaranteed that you'll be singing at the top of your lungs with your buddies after a couple of listens.  Six-2 closes off the track, but Nate really carried this one so much so you wish he did it alone.    One of the best tracks on 2001 is the highly slept on \\"What's The Difference\\".  Dre uses some horns, a drum set and some synth for this up-tempo dark beat.  Every rapper drops a quotable; Dre's is a dedication to his damaged friendship with the D.O.C., X just showed he was ready to blow (\\"A heartless bastard, high and plastered/ My style is like the reaction of too much acid\\"), & Em has a hilarious dedication to Kim (before it got old).    \\"Light Speed\\" sounds like a let down at first, after so many great songs.  This is one that grows on you more after time.  It's good, but in the shuffle it gets lost.  It will probably be skipped by most to get to 2001's most popular song, \\"Forgot About Dre\\".  Everyone's heard it before, Em drops a great verse and hook, but Dre absolutely tears into the skeptics (\\"If it was up to me, you muh'f****rs would stop coming up to me/ wit your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free/ When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin me/ But now that I got this little company/ Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease/ Butyou won't get a crumb from me/ Cause I'm from the streets of (c-c-compton)/ I told `em all - all them little gangstas/ Who you think helped mold 'em all?/ Now you wanna run around talkin bout guns like I ain't got none/ What you think I sold 'em all? Cause I stay well off/ Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off/ What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad/ tryin to get this damn label off?\\").    \\"The Next Episode\\" is the \\"Nothing But a `G' Thang\\" reunion of Dre & Snoop (remember Dre's immortal \\"so just chill.... til the next episode\\").  While this track doesn't match \\"G Thang\\" it is was certainly worth the wait.  Short but sweet, and Nate closes it out in classic fashion.  \\"Let's Get High\\" has another great groove to it, but deteriorates lyrically as the baton is passed from Dre, to Kurupt (what happened to him? He used to be amazing) until it's completely fumbled by Ms. Roq (it's no wonder we haven't seen her since this album).  \\"B**** N****\\" is the flip of the previous \\"B**** Ain't S****\\" this time making a statement about... well, the title sums it up.  The beat here is a great slow, chill, production that uses a lot of various percussion elements throughout.  Hittman's verse is pretty hilarious, making this another great track.  Next up the horror theme music \\"Murder Ink\\" is a pretty forgettable track.  It crazy that \\"2001\\" is so good at this point a decent track sounds lame.  You're spoiled with incredible tracks that if it doesn't catch your ear right away, you get impatient and skip to the next work of genius.    \\"Ed-Ucation\\" spoken by Eddie Griffin, is the only skit on here really worth listening too.    The next track is a west coast tour de force appropriately titled \\"Some LA N****\\", as some of the west's best veterans and newcomers get on the mic.  Dre uses this ill stop-and-go beat, and while every uses it well, Xzibit utilizes it perfectly imitating the same style to punctuate some lines.  This is a favorite of mine... but brings upa huge complaint as well.  How can Dre possibly DENY MC Ren a verse to rip after giving chills at the beginning with \\"Yeah, n*** MC Ren up in this muthaf****!!\\" Every west coast fan falls off their chair in disbelief when the song closes with no verse from Ren.  \\"Housewife\\" is a solid effort, flawless production as usual from Dre, and great verses from Dre & Hittman.  However, Kurupt somehow drops the ball again, although he's not terrible, it's like he refuses to return to his top form.  \\"Ackrite\\" is a showcase for Hittman (whom if you didn't figure it out by now, was Dre's big new star at the time... don't ask what happened) and is a pretty decent effort.  Although you can think of a lot of other people you'd rather see get a solo track on \\"2001\\", it's still a good song.    The hard thumping gunshots of \\"Bang Bang\\" add to an already stellar production.  Dre & Hittman come pretty strong, but Knoc-turn'al standouts with the second verse.  \\"2001\\" closes with a nice introspective \\"Message\\" solo from Dre, but ironically produced by Lord Finesse (is that THE Lord Finesse??).  You gotta hand it to Dre for really pouring his heart out here, which you don't often hear him do.  It's hard to front on this personal track, as it brings the album to a perfect close.     Dre pulls the ultimate revenge on his haters & critics by delivering another classic, influential record.  \\"2001's\\" quality & enjoyability is matched only by its status and growing legacy.  We still have a couple years to wait for Detox, but until then don't hesitate to roll-up and keep gettin' lifted from the classic vibes of both \\"The Chronic\\" & \\"2001\\".  (9.5/10)
B00005MAM2|3.0|An interesting, thought provoking anime that delves into the human psyche and also deals with human evolution. Thought provoking until about the last 15 minutes. At that point it just gets wierd and makes no sense. The main character, Tetsuo, turns into a giant mutant bloatsac and they never really explain who the hell Akira is  an how he really relates to the story. Also, Tetsuo's girlfriend has to be the ugliest girl in anime history. If you want to see a classic anime that delves into the human mind, then see Neon Genesis Evangelion. As for human evolution, wait for the upcoming Elfen Lied. I enjoyed both better than Akira. Elfen Lied, unfortunatly, slightly lacks some character developement and is too short of a series.
B000002KBU|5.0|This album signaled Joni Mitchell's entry into the pantheon of American songwriters.  Her genius abounds in every deeply felt song.  Beautifully sung and played, this is a record everyone should experience.
B00000I8UF|5.0|A classic. Pure hardbop from a great lineup. A good place to start if you're a beginner on Jazz music (you'll enjoy it right from the first listen). All of the tracks are originals (from Golson and Timmons) except the standard \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" (which is by the way, one of the highlights). For me the most inspired here is the brilliant Lee Morgan and of course Art Blakey. But I have to mention Bobby Timmons. His solos are full of joy and vitality. They sound so fresh and melodic (with an evident bluesy touch). Golson keeps often a fast pace and Morgan takes it powerful but in a gentle manner. With such a class!. He's totally loose in here. He tells you every time: 'What do you want to hear now?'. But everybody is inspired and happy on \\"Moanin'\\". Only that Lee must have been possessed or something. This record is the perfect prescription for depression. <br />  So \\"Moanin'\\" is a true example of the greatness of Jazz music and perhaps the first to mention in every hardbop collection (if you like this one, try then \\"Song for my father\\"). And I'm even bold enough to say to you:  \\"If you don't like it, I'll give your money back\\". <br />  Thanks Rudy!
B00009W0U4|4.0|Not bad at all.<br /><br />Though, it was a bit overdramatized at parts, and the camera work was so pretentious at parts, it made me want to puke.<br /><br />Everything else about this film is great.<br /><br />There is one infamous scene where a dude gets his skull crushed in with a fire extinguisher, that just had me cringing...and I have a STRONG tummy (I've won several hot pepper eating contests).<br /><br />This film proudly shines in all of its brutality, and still has the charm to make it a notch above the immitators.<br /><br />Great acting, script...get the gist from other reviewers, just wanted to add my two cents.
0060989157|5.0|An excellent read, Very hard to put down this book which jumps around but seems to grab your attention and hold you in antisipation on what these crazy guys do next!It is hard to believe that they have lived through this stuff and can actually still be able to complete a whole sentence!!
B00005JMYI|3.0|This movie is a good rental but not worth buying. You can watch it once and that's about it. Not a classic like Elf or Old School.
B000002KFJ|5.0|1975's Sabotage took Black Sabbath to new limits. Their lyrics went deeper than before, and they tokk heavy to a whole new level. This is their greatest album, with any line up, and showcased a great time for the lads.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|this movie is awesome! Jack Gylenhaal played a great part in this movie. I absolutely loved it. It's for those of you who are open minded and looking for something interesting to keep your interest for a while. His sister Maggie is also in this movie and does a fine job. I recommend this movie for those hot topic, dark personality type people. Definitely worth getting.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|This was such a bad movie that I couldn't finish watching it. Just pathetic. Inept acting, visually stulifying, embarrasing hodge podge of dung. Homer or Dante treated with the skill and depth lavished on Tolkein Trilogy would be breathtaking and only WetaWorkshop capable of doing it. Alas
044024157X|5.0|John Grisham has become one of my favorite authors.  I noticed as I was getting to the end of the story I didn't want it to end, so I savored every word.<br /><br />The Last Juror is one of my all time favorites.
0440180295|5.0|The bombing of Dresden is what Slaughterhouse 5 is really about. The first chapter accounting for Vonnegut's own experience as a prisoner of war, who witnessed the bombing himself. He explains how this is a book about those events, how it is not a big book, because only so much can be said. A comment which is true, this is not a big book, just over 150 pages, but even with that Dresden remains a presence. Something inevitable and dark, which can't be shifted, and reflects throughout the real tragedy that is Billy Pilgrim's life. Even if he manages to shrug everything else off, we the reader are left with the effect of Vonnegut's story.Its funny too.
B0000AOV85|4.0|For those of you who are big Pink floyd fans you'll love the Dark Side of OZ, the Dark Side of the Moon synched to The Wizard of OZ. it is trip fantasic!<br /><br />[...]
B0002OERI0|4.0|I loved Dookie back in the day, but haven't bought a Green Day CD since..until now.  I was hesitant to buy this one, but after a coworker recommended it and really enjoying their 3 singles off of the CD, I gave it a chance when I saw it on sale.  Suffice it to say, I was anything but disappointed.<br /><br />American Idiot is much more than the singles on the CD.  Moreover, it's much more than the politically charged title song.  It is, pure and simple, an archetypal collaboration that will surprise you with its unrivaled originality and passion.  On every song, Billy Joe, Mike, and Tre bring it.  Wake Me Up When September Ends is my favorite track and was an unexpected surprise on the CD.<br /><br />Tracks #2 and 12, Jesus of Suburbia and Homecoming, respectively, treat the listener to 4 unique, yet unmistakably intertwined songs which are seamlessly meshed within each track.  Holiday and Give Me Novacaine are also standout tracks that truly resonate and vibe really well.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink floyd fans should love the mixing of the dark side of the moon to the wizard of oz. The album plays 3 times in synch to the film.<br /><br />[...]
B000002GXJ|4.0|Right before the 15 year vacation, we got this live release of the Eagles.  Classic release, sounds great on cd.  Although typical perfect \\"live\\" versions of some classic Eagles, Joe Walsh stands out as comical as he is and as talented as he is.  Some definite high points include \\"Seven Bridges Road\\", a great live version of \\"Wasted Time\\" and Joe Walsh's \\"Life's Been Good To Me So Far\\"...a former friend of mine did me a favor by keeping my tape forcing me to replace it with the cd.  If you have seen the Eagles in concert or if you are a fan, you will love this release.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|Class is often confused with style and fashion in the regards to how one dresses.  In our contemporary society this confusion is frequently expressed through flamboyance, which is usually the result of how money talks.  However, this vain perception of class has nothing to do with one's self conduct. Refinement, sophistication, and class are qualities that should be attached with characteristics such as trust, confidence, and mutual respect.  These qualities are what define a gentleman. When people see a true gentleman they only see the exterior, and it is this exterior that money buys.<br /><br />The days of gentlemen criminals are long gone.  Films such as Scarface (1983), New Jack City (1991), or any of Takashi Miike's violent gangster illustrations depict the new style of gangsters that contemporary society is facing where disloyal and ill-mannered thugs roll in the direction of dough.  These films visualize the frightening power money has on people.  This could be seen up close in a grotesque manner in the brilliant Maria Full of Grace (2004) where humans are being regarded as pack mules.  Touchez Pas Au Grisbi, which was shot over a half century ago, depicts the coming of this new criminal element.<br /><br />Nostalgia swallows Jacques Becker's crime story about the aging criminal and gentleman Max (Jean Gabin).  The story takes place in Paris where Max lives life with a women half his age while spending untold numbers of nights desiring the same meaningless affection from the women seeking their way into men's wallets.  The many visits to the night clubs have led Max to discover that he has grown old, and many of the people around him are older.  The life he once desired is no longer as appealing, as he decides that he wants to return home early.  Max even discloses this to his friend Riton (Ren&eacute; Dary) while having found out that Riton's young girlfriend has found a younger lover, as she has previously given Riton empty promises of love.<br /><br />The professional life, which Max has chosen for himself is also undergoing a transformation.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|I love music and with that I LOVE Michael Bubble!!! It's time is simply the greatest recording ever made. I thought groups like The Beatles, Rolling Stones and artists like Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix were important, people that actually write their own music. You know what, they are so insignificant compared to Bubble that I can't describe it. When his music plays, I feel like I'm running in the alps of Germany in my rhinestone studded lederhosen being chased by Siberian Huskies. It's a happy time that makes me forget I'm a total loser with no hopes of getting a date. That's why I love Bubbbblee, he makes me feel cool without me having to be cool. Have you ever listened to a CD that makes you feel like you're eating a filet mignon with mac and cheese? If you haven't, listen to this and you'll be full.  <br /> <br />There is a good chance this CD will have uses well beyond just listened to the greatest piece of music ever. I think this cd could cure anywhere from 2-4 diseases, clear up rush hour traffic and adopt cute pets from shelters. Booble has that kind of power. Don't doubt his power or he shall turn on you. If that happens, you'll know it. Jose Canseco doubted him and look at him now.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|Yeah, I can't recall why I missed seeing Sky Captain in the theaters when it first came out, and after waiting to rent it, I can safely say I made the right decision.  As Sky Captain began, I had the distinct feeling I had walked into the movie 10 minutes after it had already started.  The Director wastes no time whatsoever in explaining absolutely anything regarding the plot, what year it is and most importantly, why nobody seems to question the sudden, unexpected arrival of Super Gigantic flying robots in New York.<br /><br />While this bothered me on the outside, I was completely amazed at how visually stunning the movie was.  I was upset that any kind of set-up had been totally ignored, but I was also intrigued by what I was seeing.  There was plenty in the way of special effects, and I can see they spent more on them than they did plot development -- or even description OF the plot in general.  Why does the Sky Captain's genius inventor have access to what looks to be a ray gun?  How is it the plane he flies also has the ability to turn into a submarine as well?  Sure, I realize to accept certain movies with a fantasy/sci-fi element to it you must suspend your belief -- but usually SOME kind of explanation is given or is already apparent at the film opening.  Not here.  My questions is WHY?  It could have made the movie much more interesting and quite a bit more entertaining.  Are we dealing with an alternate past where science has grown by leaps and bounds but the rest of the world is trapped in 1939?  I wish I had the answers to these questions, but I don't.<br /><br />When all is said and done, IF I had known about some of the films problems before starting it, I honestly believe I would have enjoyed it more.  In fact, I believe I would recommend the movie for sci-fi buffs, along with a pre-explanation of a few things first.  As for the visuals in the film, they were first rate.  The cinematographer captured the essence of the late 30's and early 40's with perfect accuracy -- at least they did in MY eyes...however, the plot and so many unexplained details made an otherwise enjoyable experience fall slightly flat.th perfect accuracy -- at least they did in MY eyes...however, the plot and so many unexplained details made an otherwise enjoyable experience fall slightly flat.
0780626966|5.0|Many younger fans may not know that when A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET PART 5: THE DREAM CHILD  was released on home video<br /><br />in 1990. A longer unrated version was available featuring two uncut effects sequences not in the R rated version. The above boxed set is (and all DVD releases have been) the R rated version. What gives?<br /><br />Couldn't even include those scenes as extras. Also missing are some deleted scenes from the original Wes Craven film. They were included on the laser disc version, but not here. They have given us music videos<br /><br />by Dokken and Fat Boys but have left off a great one (LOVE KILLS) by Vinnie Vincent Invasion from Part 4. Shame, shame. Trailers,  MTV clips and other oddities have been included, which is great, but alot of obvious things have been left off.  No \\"FREDDY PHONE\\" ads.  Nothing from the Freddys Nightmares TV series (not even a trailer)  And no vintage \\"making of\\" documentaries. (Remember the one from PART 4 that played in syndication around the same time the TV series premiered? How about the 3 or 4 Freddys Dead docus that played on cable in 91)<br /><br />On the plus side:  Parts 2 and 3 are the original theatrical versions and replace songs by Bing Crosby and Dokken on the soundtrack that were cut from the VHS releases in the 80s.<br /><br />Also of interest is Part 1.  Some parts of the film have been cropped<br /><br />or snipped out to eliminate  a couple of editing/spfx  mistakes.<br /><br /> Most  notably:<br /><br />1) The opening credits are smaller and have been repositioned so that<br /><br /> if  you were to crop the movie (pan and scan) they could still be read.<br /><br />2) a few frames of Tina's stomach getting slashed, that showed the edge<br /><br />of  the rubber appliance popping off, have been snipped.<br /><br />3) A few frames of Nancy getting out of the bath tub have been slightly cropped or possibly cut . (Not sure why. Possibly as a favor to the actress, a friend of director Craven's. May have shown too much B00B.)<br /><br />4) Shots of Nancy's wrist watch that showed the wrong sleeve have been cropped out.<br /><br />The image on Part 1 Is about a thousand times better than earlier releases. Much brighter and clearer. This may have necessitated the cuts. Since the mistakes (particularly the second cut ) would have been alot more obvious.<br /><br />The only other complaint I have is about the cardboard boxes the discs come in. They get scratched up taking them  in and out of the box.watch that showed the wrong sleeve have been cropped out. <br />The image on Part 1 Is about a thousand times better than earlier releases.

B00005JN0T|4.0|I grew up reading Isaac Asimov like so many young boys in the 70's and once you found his Robot novels and short stories, you really hit the jackpot.  I was very excited to see something like I, Robot put on the big screen using special effects from today.  I KNEW it would be visually stunning (which it was) but I also instinctively knew that without Will Smith's sense of humorous acting, the movie would never break even at the box office.  I believe I was right.<br /><br />Whether you like or hate Will Smith, he has a pretty deep understanding of which movies he should accept for blockbuster appeal.  So far he has a rather impressive group of hits under his belt...really BIG hits.  Without going out too far on a limb, one could successfully argue that in the new century, he is taking over Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford's throne of major box office successive hits.  While Tom still has quite a bit of mileage left in him, Harrison hasn't given Hollywood any Super Hit for quite some time.  A few modest money making movies here and there, but absolutely nothing on the scale he delivered through the bulk of the 80's through the mid 90's.  Will Smith also has something that both Tom and Harrison lack:  genuine appeal in both action, sci-fi AND comedies.  Check out his movies if you disagree.<br /><br />Back to I, Robot.  The plot was so-so.  The effects were Top Notch and very well done, but they would have to be in order to attract Smith to a roll such as this.  If the effects fail, the entire movie does.  Will is a robo-phobic cop who distrusts robots with almost fantaticism.  It is disturbing those around him including his boss.  Robots simply CANNOT commit crimes because they are hard-wired with the 3 Laws of Robotics, originated by the late-great Isaac Asimov himself.  They are perfect and I dare-say that should robotics become possible as they are in this movie, they would be hard-wired with these same laws.  No robot in HISTORY has EVER committed a crime of ANY kind.  And yet Will's character (Dell Spooner) believes not only CAN they, but they WILL, and when they do, it will entirely take mankind by surprise.<br /><br />As the movie opens, Dell is called to investigate what is apparently a suicide by the man credited for creating the greatest robotic revolution in history.  But IS it suicide, or was he killed by a rogue version of the newest robot which is hitting the streets within the week?  All evidence, on the surface point to the fact that suicide is the ONLY logical answer.  But Dell, hating robots as he does, looks at the situation from a completely different angle and begins to ask the tough questions...forcing people to begin to question his sanity in general.  But as it turns out, and as virtually everybody who sees this movie will know from the first frame, that Dell will be proven correct in his assumptions, but exactly HOW is the big question.  Who is behind all of this?  Was it the scientist who committed suicide?  Was it the robot himself?  OR, was it the CEO of the company poised to introduce the world to the largest robotic distribution ever?  Good questions, and fun answers along the way.  Don't expect your intellect to be stretched during this movie and you should enjoy it all the more.  Simply put, a pretty decent example of eye candy put together with great effects.  Will Smith continues to exceed in picking the winners.kind.

I'll list the best songs by JD and you BETTER listen to them right NOW! ENJOY!  she's lost control, digital, isolation, love will tear us apart, transmission, shadowplay, sound of music, warsaw, glass, colony, means to an end.
B00000I8BX|5.0|Hook, line, sinker! The first two songs set the high bar to this CD. 'Shock' & 'Edgecrusher' pretty much set the standard of the best of Fear Factory. They mastered the industrial beat right on par in this release. Every song was enjoyable and I have listened to 'Descent', 'Freedom or Fire' and 'Messiah' over and over.<br /><br />Fear Factory sing to a theme and in this album that theme becomes apparent in a big way.
0064409422|5.0|The first book in the classic series about a magical land into which schoolchildren occasionally wander.  <br /> <br />     In this book, four British children from our world stumble upon the magical world of Narnia while playing hide and seek in their Uncle's home. Narnia is a land where animals speak and the snow never ceases. In fact, it's been snowing since the land fell under the evil influence of the White Witch, who is a cruel and ruthless ruler. The good citizens of Narnia wish for Aslan, the great lion, to return and banish the witch forever. But before he can return, it is prophesied, four human children must come to Narnia to help them.  <br /> <br />     There's just something about the writing in this that sucks you right in, and Lewis spares no effort to wrench both tears and laughter from us, succeeding on both counts. He manages to create a sense of awe and sanctity for the special things in Narnia, and there is just no protecting yourself from the immediacy that this book offers.  <br /> <br />     We also get a real feel for Edmund, the least well-liked of the four children, and come to feel a special sense of regret for the choices that he makes, even while understanding that we ourselves make those same types of choices.  <br /> <br />     While the book can be read as a biblical allegory, those who are not religious (or who follow other faiths) need not worry about exposing their children to something that they don't believe in. I probably read this entire series at least half a dozen times, and never once realized that the allusions are even there. It's just a beautiful, and wonderful story that transcends faiths.  <br /> <br />     If for some reason you had to choose just one series of books to read as a child, I would recommend that this series be your choice. Other series do a better job of instilling a sense of curiosity, or of realistically portraying young protagonists, but no other series can do a better job of transporting a childto a magical place.  <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this when it was actually on tv and was devastated when they took it off before even showing the entire season, or giving it half a chance. I was attracted to it because first I was already a fan of Joss Whedon't great writing and characterizations and second because I love sci-fi. I have watched the complete series on DVD several times and each time I laugh out loud and cry and am moved and want to be part of that wonderful, flawed crew. If you like great writing with humor and pathos and wonderfully real characters that are not one-dimensional then this is the DVD to buy. But if you have no sense of humor, lack imagination and don't care to think then don't bother.
B000067J1H|5.0|This film is pure genius. Edward Norton is just amazing. It's his show, despite the top billing given to Brad Pitt. Incidentally, this is the only film that I like Pitt in (ironic he's playing someone who doesn't even exist). This film is a two evening affair for me every time I watch it. The first night I watch the movie, and the second night I watch with the excellent commentary with Norton, Pitt, Bonham-Carter, and Fincher. One of my top 5 favorite films. If you like dark comedy this is for you. It'll blow your mind.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is the most addictive movie I have ever seen. I have seen it 7 times already. The visuals, the music, the mesmerizing performance of Gerard Butler as the phantom makes this truly one of my favorite movies of all time. How the critics could have so misread this marvelous movie is beyond me. I will never listen to them again!
0385493622|5.0|This book reads like the latest blockbuster novel. I started reading it at 4:30 pm and I have taken a break to write this review. I have finished about 1/2 the book and its about 7:15 pm. I am not the world's fastest reader, but what keeps my rather short attention span rivetted to each page is the pace with which the writer tells this maginificent mathematical story. He moves through time starting from Euler to the days of Gauss and Godel with a flurry. Like an Alexandre Dumas novel the characters (great mathematicians from the past 350 odd years) visit the pages carrying their link with the Fermat's Last Theorem and leave just as quickly. Like relay sprinters moving the baton along the solution of the great poser i laid to rest by generations of mathematicians. The best part is the awesome history lesson added witht he fact the you realise (albeit with a lot of hand waving) how mathematician approch problem solving: giants standing on the shoulders of giants. This book requires very little knowledge of math. In fact for those attempting to get into recreational mathematics and looking to explore Fermat's Last theorem this is the first book you would want to read. Highly recommended. Now to get back to the book!!
B0006M4SO6|4.0|After listening to Pat's previous CD (SON) about a million times, I was very curious how he would continue the music brilliance on his next release.  I must admit, I was a bit disappointed on the first pass through this CD but noticed that it grows on you and gets better each time you listen.  On the downside, it tends to sound like a long jam session throughout much of the CD, and I'd like to hear more piano parts from Lyle.  On the upside, it displays tremendous raw musical talent with the complex chord progressions and abundant key and rhythm variations.  I also thought it showcased the drummer very well.  Probably not Pat's best CD in my opinion, but very intriguing to listen to!

B00001ZULV|3.0|As many of you would agree, Genesis needs to have a 2-disc treatment instead of insulting us with a puny 1-disc set. Unlike most reviewers, I am not upset getting single versions of Mama, ABACAB, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight and No Son Of Mine it's good that they are available for CD but I do agree with the glaring omissions of Your Own Special Way(though not a hit but the first charted Genesis hit),No Reply At All, Keep It Dark, Man on The Corner, Paperlate, Illegal Alien , Taking It All too Hard, Home By The Sea ,Never A Time and one song you may hate me to say that it should be included:Anything She Does. I remember the video and I don't know why it was never released their other 5 released from Invisible Touch all reached the top 10 so that puzzles me. Anyways, this greatest hits has some good ones primarily Follow You Follow Me and to me it seems this sounds like something Cat Stevens would've recorded. Something also that should have been on here would have cool remixes of Invisible Touch Land of Confusion and I Cant Dance. Of course you can get those on the Genesis box set which is also worth getting. In closing this is an overall okay CD if you are just discovering Genesis since you may started listening to him solo. You won't be disappointed in this CD but I bet you'll be wanting to hear more.
068987474X|5.0|I've never had a successful relationship with a guy that I've pursued. ~Liz Tuccillo<br /><br />Greg Behrendt has one solution for every problem you have with the man in your life. Get rid of him if he doesn't live up to your full expectations.<br /><br />This is easier said than done. In the first place, men are complex creatures who enjoy a challenge. We enjoy a challenge too and this seems to be the impasse. For this entire love game to work out someone needs to eventually submit to the torture of love and be caught and then they need to become a challenge again.<br /><br />While Greg Behrendt has a great sense of humor about the entire matter, Liz Tuccillo almost seems to wish she had the power not to fall in love with the wrong men although she finds them very exciting. This book is filled with letters written by willing women who are seeking commitment or at least a sense of consideration from their men. Greg leads the discussion and Liz presents the female perspective.<br /><br />So, the questions are:<br /><br />Should you ever call a guy?<br />Should you skip the whole \\"I need a man to love me\\" situation and go buy a kitten?<br />Is self-esteem the first issue on the table?<br />How much self-control does a woman need to have anyway?<br /><br />This book left me with even more questions than it answers. Yes, I love the letters and Greg's responses, but I am still wondering why the women in this book are not able to work a magic spell of attraction to seduce their men into committing to a satisfying relationship.<br /><br />Greg says that if a man is not trying to undress you, he is not that into you. What about men who have religious reasons for not seducing you or who actually want to honor you and respect you as a woman who needs commitment before sex?<br /><br />Humans want companionship, life can be lonely and we all want to be loved. So, what is the real reason \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" and does this book really help you understand men?<br /><br />If you are in an unsatisfying relationship, Greg and Liz will give you the nudge you need to pack your bags and move onto a man who can please you. There are lists of \\"standard suggestions\\" to help you raise your standards. If you are looking for a new boyfriend, this book will give you an idea of who you should be looking for and it isn't the man who leaves you at home waiting by the phone.<br /><br />Personally, I think if you want a loyal, loving, cuddly creature who gives you unconditional love day in and day out...yep, adopt a cat from the local shelter.<br /><br />If you want a man, you might have to become more like a cat and play a more subtle game all while developing the qualities the man you love desires the most. There is nothing wrong with adapting areas of your life to attract the man of your dreams as long as it works for you and you love adventure.<br /><br />My husband is an eternal challenge and I wouldn't want him any other way. Sure it can be difficult to find a man to marry and it took me 8 years, but let me tell you, it is even more difficult to keep a man happy in the long-term. Look at the divorce rate. You have to be a challenge from hello until death us do part, read a lot of books and understand relationship games.<br /><br />It seems our mothers were right even if we don't like to admit it. Chasing a man at the start might not be such a good idea. I love the story about the woman who made a man hunt down her phone number. What a woman! I personally think a lot of women give men sex way too soon and that is why men lose interest. This entire book is saying exactly that in so many ways.<br /><br />Do you have a red crayon? You are going to need one. I loved the sarcastic humor in this book and the letters from Nikki are very entertaining. The \\"What You Should Have Learned in This Chapter\\" sections also help to summarize the main points and you might enjoy posting some of the points on a bulletin board or on your refrigerator. This book is not just for single women, I think it could also help a married woman's self-esteem.<br /><br />I'm going to agree with Liz here and say that I have also never had an overly satisfying relationship with a man I chased at the start. I like the idea of being a little more mysterious. The truth is - if women didn't put up with being treated badly, men wouldn't treat us badly. They want and need sex. Common, women have all the power. They just need to learn how to use the power they have.<br /><br />In that regard, this book is helpful and liberating. Greg is really trying to boost your self-esteem and I think he does an excellent job. I liked his line: \\"Don't waste the pretty.\\" Life is really too short to waste on a man who doesn't even \\"try\\" to satisfy you. Men are as confused about us as we are about them. So, it is a learning process that takes an entire lifetime. Are you up for the challenge? I think you are. ;) Kindness counts.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewth Liz here and say that I have also never had an overly satisfying relationship with a man I chased at the start.

B00074CBIS|3.0|I like the movie despite the fact that the plot is unrealistic. The movie is about a really good guy but a bad cop played by Jimmy Fallon who's after a bunch of super-model type crooks but is way out his league. That is until Belle who is played by Queen Latifah enters the picture. The ending was bad but wasn't good either. I don't know why Henry Simmons or Ann-Margaret was in the movie it didn't add or subtract in the movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" remains my favorite series in recent years. The writing is wonderful, the cinematography excellent, and the love the actors have for their characters really comes through. The commentaries are so interesting and amusing that I've listened to them many times.  <br /> <br />While I appreciate \\"Buffy\\" and \\"Angel,\\" I never got into them. The FOX network's cancellation of \\"Firefly,\\" on the other hand, along with a distaste for what they did choose to broadcast, prompted me to cease watching FOX for over a year.   <br /> <br />Even if you're not a fan of science fiction, I highly recommend this series for anyone who loves a good adventure, with lots of sharp humor thrown in.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Although a recent Joss Whedon fan, I was reluctant to start watching Firefly, partly because the story seemed so different than his other two shows. It was also hard to imagine Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, and Adam Baldwin being enjoyable to watch after I'd seen them play major baddies on Buffy and Angel.  <br /> <br />I'm so glad I got over that. <br /> <br />Firefly was a wonderful series, more \\"adult\\" than the other two. It's wonderfully written, the acting is great, and the visual experience is beautiful. Since I got the DVDs I've watched the whole series two or three times, and now I'm getting my friends into it. The commentaries were great too. Nathan and Alan Tudyk are hilarious together. And you can always count on Joss to add his wisdom.  <br /> <br />Any Whedon fan should definitely have this in his/her collection. And those not familiar with Joss' work will find this a good place to start.

The version of Mob Rules on the Heavy Metal soundtrack is 100 times better. It has a greater energy than this version. The production sucks the life right out of this one. <br />Still, the rest of the material succeeds.....

B000286RZM|5.0|THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD: THOSE THAT GET JOHN FRUSCIANTE'S MUSIC AND THOSE THAT DON'T.  THOSE THAT DO GET IT SEEM TO REALLY GET IT AND LATCH ONTO HIM AND BE REALLY TOUCHED BY HIM.  THOSE THAT DON'T, SEEM TO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE THAT DO GET HIM, SEE IN IT.  THEY DON'T LIKE HIS VOICE OR WHATEVER OTHER REASON THEY GIVE FOR NOT LIKING HIM (ALTHOUGH I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANY HUMAN COULD NOT LIKE AND BE TOUCHED BY JOHN AND I WOULD ASSUME MOST OF HIS FANS DON'T GET IT EITHER).  ANYWAYS AS YOU PROBABLY GUESSED BY THE 5 STAR RATING I AM ONE THAT GETS JOHN FRUSCIANTE.  THE MAN IS AMAZING.  HE IS A TOP NOTCH GUITAR PLAYER, WRITER, AND HUMAN BEING(HOW MANY OTHER BANDS/ARTISTS GIVE THEIR FANS A FREE INTERNET ALBUM? AND SPAWN THEIR FANS TO MAKE A TRIBUTE ALBUM). <br /> <br />OK NOW THE ALBUM REVIEW.  THE WILL TO DEATH IS GREAT.  IT BASICALLY IS JUST ROCK MUSIC THAT IS VERY WELL DONE.  THE INSTRUMENTS, PRODUCTION AND LYRICS ARE ALL GREAT. JOHN'S VOICE SOUNDS THE BEST IT EVER HAS UP TO THIS POINT(IT IS EVEN BETTER ON LATER RELEASES ESPECIALLY CURTAINS).  I LOVE HIS VOICE IT TOOK AWHILE FOR ME TO GET USED TO IT BUT NOW I THINK HE HAS A GREAT VOICE FOR THE MUSIC HE PLAYS.  PLUS THE WAY HE SINGS IS GREAT TOO.  HE HAS SO MUCH EMOTION WHEN HE SINGS.  ANYWAYS MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE: A DOUBT, TIME RUNS OUT, FAR AWAY, AND UNCHANGING.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is one of those ten cds you would want with you if you were stranded on a desert island with nothing but a boombox. <br />I remember this being the first recording I bought directly on CD instead of buying the vinyl or cassette and upgrading. <br />I still have the original that I bought and as much as it has been played over the years, it still makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck at times...especially Where the Streets Have No Name and In God's Country. Flawless. Timeless.  <br />I wouldn't bother comparing it to Achtung Baby, either. That would also be one the other 9 discs I would want with me forever.

B000002KKS|4.0|This one rocks. Period. <br />Children of the Sea is as good as anything the original line-up ever did, but it stands on its own. <br />Heaven and Hell, Neon Knights and Die Young are also classic. <br />The second side sags a little at the end, but this is definitely worth a listen.
0446677450|1.0|I read this book after hearing great reviews about it, but I was shocked by the lack of specifics and the sad disdain this guy apparently has for his father who wasn't rich enough for Kiyosaki. What's worse, much of the book seems to be completely fictional.  <br /> <br />Kiyosaki starts the book by talking about his 'poor' childhood in Hawaii, which frankly didn't sound too bad. Yet that doesn't seem to stop him from disdaining his real father  who had the misfortune to become a middle-class college professor rather than an idealized Trump-like executive. His bitterness over these circumstances lead him to take every opportunity to humiliate his father by talking about how he never was more than middle class--as if that's something shameful. (This is extremely weird because 'Rich Dad' was never really his dad at all--just some guy who gave him financial advice. Stranger still--it seems very likely that this character has been created completely from Kiyosaki's imagination.)  <br /> <br />If you want better insights into how middle-class people can build wealth, you're better off reading 'The Millionaire Next Door'. It talks about saving and scrimping and not being a showoff with your money. Like Not Buying Rolex Watches.
B000005RFQ|1.0|#1 rule of good hard rock music: <br /> <br />If your DAD recommends it - it's probably CRAP. <br /> <br />Exhibit A - Born Again. <br /> <br />This one is lame in every respect. There isn't one decent or memorable song here. At the time, a complete waste of vinyl and now a complete waste of precious metals. <br />So, if your mom tells you to listen to Bon Jovi, do you buy THAT crap too? <br />
B0000024K1|5.0|All that I could say after hearing this album for the first time was \\"wow!\\"  Even though the tracks here are almost two decades old, they sound much more daring, progressive, and experimental than any rap you can hear on the radio today.  Is it possible that we are \\"de-evolving\\" now that perfection was already reached in 1988?  I mean, I enjoy a lot of Snoop and NWA as well, but everything recorded since, say 1995 has been pretty abysmal in comparison to rap's \\"Golden Age.\\"  I suspect that since Chuck D. and the gang so thoroughly nailed it here, others knew that they couldn't rise to the occasion, so they didn't even try.         This album is a musical marvel, in every sense of the word.  This is coming from a southern white male who was only four years old when this came out and, a mere few months ago, hated pretty much all rap.  What can I say?  I've been converted.  Chuck D.'s militant message here is simply dead on, and while I can't quite get behind their endorsement of Farakhan, I can overlook that, because I agree completely with everything else they're laying down here.  From the first track to the last, the album is a relentless indictment of government and media, from the unheard voices of urban America.  And if that wasn't enough, the music is incredibly funky.         I'll take these Bomb Squad arrangements and Terminator X turntable magic over all of the over-produced pop garbage we have to put up with now any day of the week.  Others have already extolled the merits of the brilliant production values and technical superiority, so all I'll say is this.  The grooves here are as deep and pervasive as anything you will ever hear in popular music.  I've loved all types of music, from Sinatra to Stravinsky, and if \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\" doesn't get some butts shaking at your next house party, consider moving to a funkier neighborhood!!!         Other stand-out tracks here are numerous.  The repetitive striking of a minor piano chord in \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\" makes for a menacing, delightful hip-hop experience.  In this anti-authority \\"story song\\", you can almost hear an early prototype of later, very similar songs like Dr. Dre's \\"Deep Cover\\" but this is ten times better!  Chuck is in great voice, and this track seems way ahead of its time.         You can't go wrong with this album, as it is perfection epitomized, on every level.  If you, like me, are fairly new to rap, check this one out and get a taste of how rap SHOULD sound, and how it sounded for so many years before the hollow, voiceless perpetrators and posers took it over (in the interest of civility, I won't name names, but you all know who I'm talking about!)  On a lighter note, I want to share with you my idea for the perfect drinking game.  Turn this thing up to full-blast on your speakers, get a bottle of your beverage of choice, and take a shot every time Flavor Flav shouts \\"Yeeeaaah, boyeeee!!!!!!\\"         Uhhh...maybe you'd better make that HALF a shot.  Afterall, I wouldn't want anybody out there to get alcohol poisoning!
B000001DTM|5.0|Bands don't usually survive this kind of re-invention. U2 actually matched the brilliance of the Joshua Tree with this one. <br />\\"One\\" is kind of tired at this point, but the rest of the cd still bristles with an undeniable energy.  <br />Check out \\"Until the End of the World\\", \\"The Fly\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" and \\"Acrobat\\" - and feel the chills. <br />Classic stuff....
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is superb!  I really loved the stage musical but this is ten times better...no, a hundred times better.  I even had people who said they disliked the stage version comment on how great this film is.  I don't understand why the critics are so harsh when the viewers are enjoying it.  I should know, I've seen it nine times already...and I'm not the only one. <br /> <br />There are some prominent changes from the stage version, but if you've never seen the stage version this movie is just as enjoyable.  Gerard Butler did a phenomenal job.  I myself was a little leary of him, knowing he's no Michael Crawford, but now I like him a lot better than Michael Crawford.  He makes the Phantom more emotional, powerful, and more easier to sympathize with.  Gerard definately deserved an Oscar nod for his role, but that's neither here nor there. <br /> <br />I won't give away any of the surprises of the film, but I will tell you something...you won't be disappointed.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get mad, you'll feel sad, you'll want to jump for joy, then you'll want to throw things...it's a very emotional piece and not just for women (believe it or not, more men have cried in the theater than women). <br /> <br />This is a must buy!  You may even want two copies because you will wear out one of them for sure.
B000001EAQ|4.0|I always thought this one got a bad rap. It had much more of a \\"club\\" sound, but at the core is what made Achtung Baby interesting - solid material to bend and stretch into new areas of sound for U2. It really wasn't as radical it was made out to be. <br />\\"Gone\\", \\"The Last Night on Earth\\", \\"Mofo\\" and \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\" are excellent and stand right alongside U2's finests moments. <br />Sure, \\"Playboy Mansion\\" and \\"Staring At The Sun\\" are crap, but the rest of the CD is more than worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />Let's put it this way: <br />The day I bought All That You Can't Leave Behind, I listened to it once, sold it back to the store I bought it from and cranked up POP on the drive home. <br />
B0006213WG|5.0|I find particularly sad when a supposedly \\"official\\" music critic, hired by Amazon, goes down the predictable path of slagging off a Band for taking themselves a bit more seriously, both in content and musically. Are bands supposed to stay amateurish and \\"goofy\\" if they once started out that way? The great irony of Aidin Vaziri's criticism is that on \\"Chuck\\", Sum 41 actually continue to take a swipe at mainstream music, but have now taken the bold step of attacking the status quo of politics, something not attempted by many.  <br />So, apart from giving this album a great thumbs up, I really do suggest Amazon.com to reconsider Mr. Vaziri's employment.
B00000I07P|1.0|I agree with Motorbreth 100%. This is the absolute bottom of the barrel. This is the album and the band that made heavy metal/hard rock about hair instead of music. The WORST band of ALL TIME. <br />COMPLETE and UTTER GARBAGE. <br />There isn't one second of music here that dislays the slightest bit of talent or musicianship. Jon Bon Jovi is the WORST singer in modern music. Period. Steve Perry and Journey are more credible (...ugh. I can't believe I just wrote that! - DAMN YOU, Bon Jovi!) <br />A complete waste of time and money.....
B0001GH7KY|3.0|Lucio Fulci  is one oddly inconsistent filmmaker.  I've only seen 4 of his films, though arguably his 4 most famous ones, which were made pretty much one after another.  Yet they vary wildly in quality on extremely basic levels.  While 'Zombie' is not the height of cinematic sophistication, it is essentially competent.  It's not scary by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't really take it as a joke.  Then with 'City of the Living Dead' Fulci apparently forgot everything he knew, and made a film that isn't half as professional as was 'Zombie'.(Though it still was an entertaining film, certainly)  Then he makes 'The Beyond', which is not w/o a few rough edges and some hokiness at times, but still a genuinely stylish and atmospheric film most of the time.  And then we get 'The House by the Cemetery' and are back in 'City of the Living Dead' territory, competency wise.  As with that film, 'House...' is entertaining, and worth a look for people who enjoy cheap horror films.  But it ain't good, by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />This film contains an odd mishmash of genres mixing haunted house with slasher with a dash of zombie film.  I won't bother with the plot too much- a family moves into the house which has a murderous zombie-dude, Dr. Freudstein, in the cellar, who has to kill in order to live on and on.(Why or how this is is never addressed. Not that it matters.)  Also, the kid in the family, Bob, has telepathic abilities, and has a little girl friend who no one else can see.  That's about it. They sit around, and occasionally Freudstein tries to stab them up, and often succeeds.  I don't mind the sitting around- I thought that the atmosphere and tone of 'The Beyond' was the better part of the film.  However, the setting isn't all that interesting visually, and the score is hokey and overwrought, particularly when compared Frizzi's or Goblin's better work.  So, the film tends to come out as more uneventful than atmospheric.<br /><br />(However, I've only seen a crappy cheapass version, rather than the Anchor Bay one.  Thus, the print and transfer were terrible, and I presume it would be at least somewhat more interesting visually with a decent print.  Still, I doubt if it would be anywhere near being a genuinely good horror film.)<br /><br />The film is less gory than the other films I've seen from him, but it's still got a fair amount.  Freudstein mostly likes to work the throat, to quite gruesome effect.  Their are some conceptually cool effects that don't really pan out in execution.  Towards the beginning of the film, Freudstein stabs someone through the back of the head, with such force that the blade comes out her mouth.  Cool idea, lame execution.  Later, Freudstein is cut, and starts to bleed maggots.  Once again, the effect ain't ideal, but the concept is neat enough that it doesn't matter too much. Finally, while Freudstein's mannerisms are quite effective, his makeup pretty  much sucks.<br /><br />Still, the film does have a few effectively atmospheric moments, as did 'City...'  The best part would be when the father of the family finds a tape that the previous tenant recorded. As he plays it the camera ominously pans about the house, moving into the cellar which is then filled with creepy mutilated corpses.(Which mysteriously appear again later)  The rather inexplicable ending is pretty cool too, though I won't go into specifics.<br /><br />And yeah, Bob is plenty obnoxious, but I've seen other kids in movies that are equally obnoxious.  And yeah, the bat attack is extremely weak, but the bat attack in 'Suspiria' was lame too, as was the Bug attack scene in 'Phantasm' but I almost never hear anyone complain about those scenes.  One lame horror scene doesn't kill a movie.  There's also some hilarious Foley work, particularly when a head is rolling down a staircase.  Sounds like a damn bowling ball.Still, this movie is entertaining, and I just like watching Fulci's work.  I actually enjoy  his leisurely pacing, even when there isn't all that much atmosphere, and his distinctive visual tics.  (Random zooms and close-ups, Focusing near then far in the same shot and vice versa, eye shots etc.)  So, it gets my recommendation, if not exactly the heartiest one ever.is leisurely pacing, even when there isn't all that much atmosphere, and his distinctive visual tics.

0385510454|2.0|This was the first Grisham book I've ever read, and now, after reading this veritable Italian travel guide, the last Grisham book I'll ever read.  No plot, no character development, no ending; these things describe this book.  The most interesting parts of the book were the Israeli assasination team, or KIDON, and the Chinese hitman, but niether of them end up playing a big role in the book.  I thought perhaps the main character, Backman, would eventually end up on the run being chased down by these assasins..but no, that would  have taken to much thought on part of the author. <br /> <br />Seriously, don't waste your time or money.  Do not reward Grisham for a half-a$$ed effort.
0783117523|2.0|This movie was bad.  The acting was horrible.  Merecedes Rhuel who played Gia's mother was like a cartoon character.  The only good performance was by the blonde girlfriend (Elizabeth Mitchell).  The whole thing just reeked of a made-for-HBO movie. <br />Fine for a late night hotel tv watch.  Also, the Terrence Blanchard jazz soundtrack was pretty good.  Otherwise, a PASS.
B0000033P2|5.0|Forget Tarkus, Trilogy is probably the best ELP album.  It's got all the elements.  The piano solo, creepy synthesizer, modern classical composer cover, western ballad, acoustic guitar, synth instrumental and more.  From beginning to end, Trilogy is a journey that will show you the diverse capabilities of the band.    <br />  <br />  Let the genius of artists Emerson, Lake and Palmer surround you with their melodius soundscape.  Crank up the volume, if you have good speakers, lean back, and let ELP do the rest.  I swear you son't regret it.

None of us knew much about her so we were pleasently surprised.  We had heard some songs in the past but I don't think she got the play she obviously deserved.  Her songs got everyone in the mood to start dancing.  We danced and partied all night.  It was alot of fun.  Check out her videos because they are awesome.  She is truly an inspiration.
B0000025T6|4.0|This was a landmark recording. <br /> <br />The River, released in in 1981, was a great record. <br />But it was the last Springsteen record to be loaded with rave-up rockers or musically interesting material. In other words, the last recording to be full of meolody or rhythm. <br /> <br />Since then it's been all downhill. <br />And this wretched waste of wax called \\"Nebraska\\" marked Springsteen's turn down a new road: the path that took him from being the greatest rock star in the world...to being a pretentiously boring moaner and complainer. <br />He hasn't \\"matured\\" as an artist. <br />He's become a pandering preacher of pain.   <br /> <br />It's all very sad.

B0006399FS|3.0|I love U2; however, when it comes to this album... its just not great. The lyrics are certainly more pointed than they ever have been, mostly about Bono's loss of his father, but the music isn't great. I usually give an album a week or two before I decide something. After more than the usual time I must say that this album is very sub-par. The music is just off. To put it more direct: the music is slow, lathargic, repetitous, and dull. Moreover, Bono and the Edge spend way to much time in the false setto which ruins some of the chorus(s), if you ask me. Overall, it is a CD with great lyrics, boring and dull music, from a legendary band. There are a few exceptions to my reflections on the music, #1 is okay and #2 is great, but the rest is flat and dull. Not a fun album to listen to at all.   If you are looking to listen to U2 for the first time, or just considering buying the CD, pass on this one. Go back to Achtung Baby or Rattle and Hum if you want the CD wherein every song is a hit. This one has one hit and that is all.  PS- Interested in seeing how they incorporate this album in the tour... they may want to leave most of it home.  I am still a fan.
B000001GAM|5.0|The Bruckner Ninth has been the grandest object of my OCD for going on twenty years now, so I have sometimes thought it a bit odd that I have reviewed kind of \\"all over the board\\" on Amazon, but have never reviewed a Ninth. I have nearly sixty recordings of this dark, and often spiritually harrowing work, which I have read aptly described as \\"Parsifal without words\\" and an \\"orchestral Paradise Lost.\\" I used to have 68 recordings, until I finally started \\"weeding\\" a few years back, and backed off on my \\"completism,\\" a bit.     I picked the Giulini at random to review because it was the first (i.e. bestselling) Ninth that came up in an Amazon search...which worked out well since the Giulini VPO recording is still among my five favorite Ninths (the other four/five being Furtwangler, Barenboim/BPO, Haitink/Concertgebouw[the most Philips recording]; while the Skrowaczewski/Minnesota recording and Gunter Wand's 1994 NDRSO recording share the fifth spot).    I very much enjoyed Giulini's earlier Chicago recording, in which Giulini effectively underlined some dissonances that aren't normally heard clearly in the grimly grand first movement coda; and I eagerly awaited his VPO Ninth...especially since his VPO Eighth had been only the second Bruckner symphony recording I ever heard (Inbal's Seventh was the first), and it was the first Eighth I ever fell in love with (for my first few years as a \\"Brucknerd\\" it was the only Eighth I liked. So when I first saw the timings on the Giulini/VPO recording--back then I paid WAY too much attention to timings--I thought that something must be seriously amiss. He was nearly ten minutes slower than Haitink's, by no means brisk, Digital recording! But I liked Giulini's majestic Eighth so much, I gave this Ninth a chance...and, let's just say that this is the recording that taught me, once and for all, not to pay so much attention to timings!    This performance and recording are wonderful, with those beautiful Vienna horns glowing with warmth and grandeur; and some rapturous string playing, especially in the more rhapsodic moments of the adagio. Okay, I've recently been making an attempt to be less verbose in my reviews, so I'm out.
B0000TB014|1.0|I bought this DVD for my wife in hopes of making her Christmas bright. Needless to say, I think this is just a bad DVD collection. From the outset, it seems like this DVD was put together in an hour. No time was taken to make it interactive, with extras, or any other bonus material. Some of the videos seem grainy and are apparently different from the one's you may have seen on MTV. It really is poor workmanship. No doubt the videos are fun for a fan to watch, but look else where if quality is important to you.  <br />This is a non-quality DVD and they should be ashamed of releasing it. <br /> <br />Sorry honey.
B00004YA0T|3.0|Ideally, I wanted to review the DG Jochum cycle, since I actually prefer that one, but it's NLA as of this posting, so I'll just make some comments about both cycles here.    Eugen Jochum may have been the greatest advocate of Bruckner, of the 20th Century. However, I have lived with this cycle, and especially the DG one, for many years now, and I have come to view his Bruckner interpretations as somewhat overrated, even  in comparison with his \\"old school Bruckner\\" colleagues. Perhaps my opinion is a little skewed by overexposure, but I have other recordings I turn to more frequently that have not started to \\"wear\\" on me as much as some of Jochums. For one example, I am not, by any means, a \\"Karajan freak\\" (I have also come to view his last VPO Eighth, over which most people seem to be \\"ga ga,\\" a bit overrated, as well) but I find his full DG cycle from the 70's and early 80's, for one, to be more consistently satisfying, with the exception of the first, fourth, and sixth, in all of which Jochum is clearly better, imo. I must say I do get tired of the cliches' about Karajan's performances being too \\"cool, polished, and sterile,\\" and Haitink's being too \\"light,\\" etc. These preconceptions, often based on preconcieved opinions about the conductors themselves, precludes people from really having to seriously consider their recordings, just as the opposite preconception that Jochum is THE Brucknerian of the century tends to make his recorded preformances somehow beyond reproach.    Based on Jochum's reputation, I eagerly awaited the DG cycle, back at a time in the late 80's when I was first getting into Bruckner when there were relatively few Bruckner recordings in print. Even on first listening, there were certain things about his interpretations that didn't sound right to me. Admittedly, at that time, I knew virtually nothing of the \\"old school,\\" with its more flexible tempi, dynamics, and more dramatic approach, to Bruckner. Since then, I have become very well acquainted with recordings of the \\"old school\\" Bruckner conductors such as Schuricht (his 1943 Ninth is one of my ten favorites), Furtwangler (his 1944 Ninth might BE my favorite), Hausegger, Kabasta, Abendroth, Matacic; Walter and Horenstein's mono recordings, etc. etc...and I still don't find many of Jochum's interpretations to compare all that favorably.    One thing you can say with some degree of confidence about Jochum is that most of his interpretations are amazingly consistent over a half century of recordings. Compare his recordings of the Fourth and Seventh from the late 1930's to those from his later DG and EMI cycles, and they are remarkably similar, both in terms of timings, tempos, and phrasing. Two examples of \\"Jochumisms\\" that have come to grate on me a bit over time are: 1) As much as I love most of his Fourth, esp. the finale, which I think he \\"nails\\" better than any other conductor, I feel that he turns the andante quasi allegretto into an adagio (in general, I can never understand why many conductors insist upon turning this flowing movement into a dirge); 2) The slow tempo he chooses for the lovely \\"enchanted forest\\" motif (as I call it) that flows out of the beautiful intro of the Seventh, which ultimately steers the whole first movement toward a slow and stodgy tempo. Jochum's Seventh almost sounds like it starts out with two adagios. His first movement isn't excessively slow in terms of it's total timing (and I've noticed that many listeners pay too much attention to timings anyway), but in terms of it's lack of flexibility and flow: there are readings of this movement a minute of two longer (like Chailly, for example, although I think his Seventh is a bit overrated) that still have a better sense of ebb and flow to them. Some examples of sevenths I prefer to Jochum's are Sinopoli's; Karajan 70's DG; Inbal's; Wand's 70's Cologne recording; Furtwangler's 1951 BPO (Rome); Abendroth's 1956 recording; and Haitink's 70's recording.    Jochum's Fifth wasone of the biggest disappointments of my Bruckner collection, esp. after all of the things I had heard about it's legendary status. Although I think his inner movements are just fine (except the slow movement of his 1938 Fifth, which I found a little too slow), I think he is too slow--and even more importantly not flexible enough--in the all important outer movements. But the \\"Jochumism\\" that grates on me the most, in ALL of his recordings, is his excessive stretching out of the coda of the finale, made even less convincing by the lack of a strong underpinning of timpani. Karajan (whose DG Fifth was my first, and is still my favorite, followed by Horenstein, Welser-Most, and Gielen) augmented this thrilling coda--Bruckner's best, even better than the Eighth's, if it's done properly--with an extra set of timpani, and very effectively. If any of you are rolling your eyes (esp. you \\"Karajan-bashers\\") at Karajan's use of extra timpani, remember that Jocum augmented the brass section for the famous chorale of the Fifth's finale...this is part of what the vanishing art of interpretation is all about. On the subject of timpani, one of the characteristics of the Bruckner \\"old school\\" was the ideal that the Bruckner orchestra started from the ground (bass) up, and needed a strong underpinning of timpani (too often missing in recent recordings), esp. in climactic moments: Furtwangler's recordings provided the best example of this; most of Jochum's recordings are surprisingly lacking in powerful timpani, and this is particularly exposed in his somewhat melodramatic lengthening of the Fifth's final coda.    In general, I find Jochum's Eighth and Ninth to be a bit terse, except for his readings of the third movement of the Ninth, which was consistently one of his best movements, esp. his Dresden recording. If his readings of 1-7--except, again, his 1,4, and 6, which I find generally excellent--tended to lack flexibility on the slow side, the outer movements of his Eighth and the first movement of his Ninths tended to lack flexibility on the fast side. One very notable exception, however, is his 1949 Hamburg Eighth, which is my very favorite Jochum recording, and perhaps one of my ten favorite Eighths overall. He gets everything right here, with a good amount of flexibility...which makes it even more puzzling to me that the outer movements of his later recordings of the Eighth were so terse by comparison.    As far as the merits of the DG cycle versus the EMI, again, there is very little to choose as far as interpretations: they are remarkably similar. The only difference that really jumped out at me was that the first movement of the Dresden Ninth was not only a little too terse, but strangely \\"herky jerky\\" in terms of some awkward tempo relations, which create more distraction than tension. Although I feel that the adagio of the Dresden Ninth is Jochum's most searching account of this movement, I still like the Ninth from the DG set a bit better.    In terms of recorded sound, again I'd have to give the nod to the DG cycle. The older DG recordings sound more natural to me, whereas the late analog EMI recordings are a bit too brightly lit, almost sounding like early digital in places. The seemingly endless permutations of packaging, repackaging, and recoupling of both of these cycles, and the individual recordings from them, has become a bit absurd, but at least it has made it very easy to pick up most of these recordings in used CD bins.
B0006IJ5PM|2.0|Is it possible to come away from a film both bored and irritated? I guess the answer is yes because I'm both, and I blame it on this highstrung, overacted mess called Friday Night Lights. It's a sports movie so predictable it's almost funny, but it has a jitteriness and dark tone with makes it about as hilarious as a tension headache.<br /><br />The movie of course is about football in Texas, where it is taken every bit as serious as Baptist sunday school and honkytonk music, but Friday Night Lights lacks believability. Many of the actors aren't big enough to pose as high school football players, especially for a rural farm-boy town they're supposedly situated in. It shows a scene where the players are weightlifting in the school gym, and I'm thinking \\"don't you kids eat?\\" They look no taller than 5' 9\\" and scrawny, with no weight to throw around. In a real Texas high school football team - especially one predicted to win the state finals as the team in Friday Night Lights is - the players are a foot bigger and a foot wider (slight exageration but you get my point). This inaccuracy threw me right off, and I had a hard time settling into the movie. No big deal anyway, because the first half suffered uneven pacing and was a little thick in the overdramatization. The second half was better, but still predictable and I had a hard time believing the game time situations or caring about the characters. And maybe that's it's most glaring flaw; the stereotypes and storylines of the main characters was too played out for me. It's like I've already seen the movie a dozen times. Blah. Wasted time, wasted money.<br /><br />The positive reviews I've read about this football flop are misleading and overly generous, and it does nothing for such a fascinating sport.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie begins with a girl and her parents moving to a new home.  Right from the beginning, the movie brought out events many of us went through as a child.  It's interesting to see how Hayao Miyazaki used this simple scene to portray a hidden layer of emotions that Chihiro (the main character) is enduring.  Miyazaki also used this scene to foreshadow the events that were to come later in the movie.  This idea of adventure and mystery resonates throughout the entire film as Chihiro finds herself in a colorful world of spirits and magic.      Throughout the movie, her courage, her strength, and her own spirit are tested as she embarks on a journey to save her parents.  This idea of being a hero also brings back many nostalgic childhood memories.  Miyazaki often tends to provoke a collage of emotions from his audience through his intricate emphasis on tiny details.  The train scene, for example, is filled with this artistic approach.  When Chihiro sits down on an empty seat, Miyazaki focuses all the attention to this; and even after she sits, he pauses for a moment to capture this image of her sitting before moving on to the next scene.  Another instance of this can be seen when the two little animal friends of hers are looking out the window, bouncing up and down.  This image immediately reminded me of my childhood and how I used to stand on the seat with my hands on the windows, gazing at the passing images outside.  I also remember how I used to bounce up and down on the seats for no reason at all.  But these are the very things that make children, children; and Miyazaki celebrates this through this and many of his other films.    The beautifully drawn images, attention to details, and the myriad of bursting colors truly embraces all the qualities of an elaborate painting.  This movie is indeed a painting which will indulge viewers into Miyazaki's free spirited world.
B00012QM86|5.0|This is truly one of the most powerful films of all time. ONe cannot help but be impacted by the raw reality that Spielberg reveals. Liam Neeson is the character whom Spielberg wants us all to be identified with. Neeson's character, underneath all the the seemingly inpenetrable disguise which he puts on, has a soft heart. This is especially seen in the scene whcih he drops to his knees and weeps knowing that he should have done more to save lives. Spielberg intertwines authentic Holocaust footage with personal character studies. THis is truly one of the few films that will not only stay with you many days after it is seen, but prompt you to do a little heart searching of your own. ONe cannot be unaffected by the showing of this absolute disregard for humanity and the atrocities which was committed by the Nazis. Spielbergs central character, Schindler, is one whom he and we all can identify with. Throughout the film, we can feel and understand every action and emotion which he goes through. The final scene in whcih some valuable stats are provided will absolutely shock you.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I first saw the english version \\"Warriors of the Wind\\" when I was a little kid. Somehow we recorded it, and I practically destroyed the tape watching it over and over. And as I grew up, I found more about the film to love, rather than growing out of it. And everyone in my family loved it as well. Then one day I lost my beloved tape and so began searching for a copy on the internet. Only then did I find out the film wasn't the whole of the story, but was actually inferior to the original. I found a rather poorly subtitled Japanese version, and gobbled up the suddenly new film. As I was searching for a copy (not easy to find, btw) I came across stories that Disney was going to re-do the english version and release it in the states in the near to distant future. I was bouncing off the walls! I'm so excited to see it coming out now. I do think Disney should have gone to theatres though. I can't wait to see what has been done to this special story of mine. Nausicaa was my hero, and no one had ever heard of her. I hope now others can share in the joy I have for all these years.
B0002IRY0O|4.0|The first time I ever heard the name Celibidache was back in the late '80's when he was on tour with the Munich Philharmonic. The word among my Bruckner fan friends was that he was on the road with a Bruckner Fourth like no other. Hmmmm...how different could it be? I didn't get to go to the performance while he was in town, but word was that it was one of those things you either loved or hated.<br /><br />The next time I encountered him was while sitting around one night with some Bruckner (and Furtwangler) fans watching \\"music videos\\"...but not exactly the MTV or VH1 kind. I saw two videos of Celibidache. The first clip was of a dashing young matinee-idol looking Celibidache, with a wild swath of hair hanging down on his forehead, conducting the BPO in a fiery reading of Beethoven's Egmont Overture. In the second video, shot about two generations after the first, a kindly, grandfatherly looking, Celibidache, in a cozy sweater, conducted a superbly controlled Munich Philharmonic from a stool, in an impossibly expansive and majestic reading of the first movement of the Bruckner Eighth (this was from the Sony release of the entire Eighth). The latter performance was so slow, when compared with any other recording you've ever heard, that it had no business sounding so good, but somehow it did.<br /><br />The Celibidache phenomenon, and his superbly drilled Munich Philharmonic, must've created a bit of a stir, for, on the heels of Sony's video releases of Celibidache's performances of Bruckner's Symphonies #6-8, EMI embarked on a project of releasing recordings of Bruckner's Symphonies #3-9, as well as recordings of works by other composers. These recordings were released in 1999, three years after the conductor's death. At that time I was what you could call a \\"Bruckner Ninth completist,\\" and I already owned one of his recordings of the Bruckner Ninth: one of those \\"quirky Italian\\" labels that speicalizes in poorly packaged--and often premium-priced--pressings of \\"historical recordings\\" had released a few Celibidache live recordings of Bruckner symphonies from the '70's and '80's (it's pretty common knowledge that the enigmatic conductor, like Furtwangler whom he had succeeded as director of the BPO in 1945, hated making studio recordings).<br /><br />This two-disc set turned out to be a good indicator of the enigma that was Celibidache. The second disc was a recording of the Ninth Symphony with the MPO from 1981. It was a very good performance, and I felt fortunate to have it in my collection, because it was also a good quality live recording; and it was with Munich (most of his live recordings from that period were with the RSO Stuttgart, a good orchestra but not as good as the MPO). The Ninth was a bit on the slow side, and there were moments when I was a bit too aware of the conductor caressing a phrase, but overall it was a worthy addition to the collection.<br /><br />The accompanying recording of the Fourth with the RSO Stuttgart from 1973 was another story. Everything was fine through the first three (and three-quarters) movements. It was a spacious account of the fourth, but no slower than, say, Bohm's 1973 VPO recording. But, then, toward the end of the finale something happened: a very self-conscious slowing down of the coda--which is plenty majestic enough w/o an unnatural slowing down. This slowing progressed until the beat was subdivided, the violins sounded like they were literally \\"sawing away\\" on their ostinatos, and the orchestra almost ground to a screeching halt before the final chord mercifully stopped sounding. At that point, I almost made a frisbee out of the disc, but I decided it still made a good conversation piece (or at least a coaster). It was the most bizarre thing I had ever heard in a recording of \\"classical\\" music. In retrospect, the interesting thing is that such extremely protracted tempos are more often associated with the performances of his last fifteen years, but this recording was made 23 years before his death: it somewhat staggers the Brucknerian imagination to think that 20 years later he made a recording of the Fourth with Munich in which the Finale was actually more than five minutes longer, actually breaking the half-hour mark, presumably for the first and last time in the annals of this work.<br /><br />[I've been trying to write shorter reviews, but apparently that's not going to happen here.]<br /><br />When the EMI recordings came out, I was much too curious about the Eighth and Ninth to allow the bizarre timings to scare me away: when I first picked up the Eighth, I thought that the timings of the last two movements--35:04 and 32:08, respectively--must've been misprints...the finale was actually  more than 12 minutes--or 60%--longer than Jochum's terse 1964 BPO recording! But I still found things to admire in these recordings, none the least of which was the superbly controlled and patient playing of the orchestra, all of whom I thought must've been practically \\"Zen masters\\" (and endurance athletes), to play a Bruckner Eighth that was longer than many recordings of the six-movement Mahler Third!<br /><br />[Really, my intent is NOT to write a review that is the verbal equivalent of a late Celibidache Bruckner recording!]<br /><br />So, when DG came out with their Celibidache recordings of Bruckner's Symphonies #3-5&7-9, at first released in two absurdly expensive boxed sets--and the people who purchased those have every right to be perturbed at DG eventually releasing them in a much more reasonably-priced single box--I looked at the set with a certain suspicious curiousity. Could these be anything more than shabby old radio recordings, released to \\"coat-tail\\" the EMI and Sony releases, and the conductor's death?<br /><br />Well, the answer is a defininte, yes, they are much more than that. Any set of Celibidache Bruckner recordings is bound to be a bit of a \\"mixed bag,\\" and, as the other reviewer pointed out, this set is...but there is muchmore to admire and enjoy here than I expected. I smiled at the other reviewer's apt comment about the \\"Karaoke Third;\\" and while the Fourth is not as annoying as the Third, in this respect, their is still more \\"Sing along with Serge\\" than I can take, esp. in the finale. It is one of my pet peeves when conductors hum and stomp their way through a performance (you can probably imagine that I don't much care for Glenn Gould's recordings): one of the Bruckner Ninths that I dumped from my \\"completist days\\" was by a conductor named Vladimir Delman, who didn't shut up for more than five seconds during the entire recording (and it wasn't even a very good Ninth even w/o the vocal accompaniment)!<br />In the case of this Celibidache Fourth, it's too bad about the vocalizing, because the tempo of the finale's coda is much more tolerable than the '73 Stuttgart one I described above.<br /><br />But, fear not, for the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth, are all very good, and the recording quality exceeded my expectations, including strong, clear horns, so important in Bruckner; and a full, warm, bass resonance. Also, Celibidache is definitely a conductor who understands the importance of good strong timpani in Bruckner, and the timpani are very well recorded throughout this set, nearly as thunderous as Karajan's, in the finale of the Fifth (HvK used an extra set of timpani in the Fifth). Yes, the tempos are on the slow side, but during this period--which I'm now thinking was a vintage period for Celibidache's Bruckner--they had not become too extreme yet. He manages to pull off the most spacious Fifth Symphony slow movement I've ever heard, with surprising success (even if this almost climax-less movement begins to get a bit monotonous, by the end; but then again, brisker readings of this movement can get a bit tedious, too).<br /><br />This was the first Celibidache Bruckner Seventh I've ever heard, and it was a very pleasant surprise, with a beautiful, but not excessively slow, adagio; and a nice, flowing, first movement. It was a pleasant surprise to hear him use a nice flowing tempo for the lovely \\"enchanted forest\\" theme (as I call it) that flows out of the majestic intro, and launches the movement proper.<br /><br />The Eighth was also very satisfying, and certainly no slower than Gunter Wand's final--and excellent--recording of the work; or Karajan's 1957 recording, for that matter.<br /><br />I still prefer Celibidache's aforementioned 1981 MPO recording of the Ninth, which is noticeably more expanisve in the outer movements than the recording included in the DG set; but both performances are evidence that Celibidache was very much in touch with the rarefied spiritual world of this (my favorite) symphony.<br /><br />If you are a Bruckner fanatic (or a \\"Brucknerd,\\" as I have sometimes called us), esp. one who likes Celibidache, who has been putting off buying this set, you need hesitate no more. Was Celibidache one of the Great Bruckner Conductors, or just an enigmatic pheonom with a cult following? I feel that this set reveals him as a great Bruckner conductor, even if like many of us, he went on to get a bit \\"eccentric\\" in his later years.

B0000024SD|5.0|Dylan really must have had a blast writing the songs for this album because he seems to be beside himself with joy during all of the performances. In fact, on one track you get to hear him and the engineer laughing their heads off before beginning the tune properly. Anyway, \\"It's Alright Ma\\" is my favorite song, and I think it's safe to say that it is the best version of it ever (McGuinn did pretty good on the EASY RIDER soundtrack, but Dylan's is even more intense). And with songs that range from fantasy (\\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\") and madness (\\"She Belongs to Me\\") to mystery (\\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\"), the album starts off running at top speed and breaks the speed barrier by its finish. It may not be the best album ever made, but if you don't own it yet, this is one adventure that you really should take and be rewarded for.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt writes his memoir in the pitch-perfect language and consciousness of an Irish-Catholic boy.  This work is a wonder to behold and although the story is sad (as are most Irish stories) there is a strong current of hope running through the pages.  Young Frankie struggles against his broken home, the church, his own shortcomings and he finds tragedy and hope in the details of Irish life.  If you value great writing, language-skills and story-telling, you will love this work.  It remains one of the finest I have ever read.
1591391105|4.0|Rather than \\"the first 90 days\\", this could also be called \\"A quick introduction to management theory\\". People who have done a lot of reading in this area will recognize situation-specific applications of Situational Leadership and a variety of other management techniques. Watkins does a good job of picking just what you need to know to get up and running in the first few months, adapting the info to the situation, and no more.<br /><br />A couple of things that would've been nice to see were not just pointers in the appendix to a few books on strategy & leadership, but also to expanded coverage of the material he presented as well as how to handle some of the situations that come next (unless he's setting us up for the sequel -- \\"the next 90 days\\"?). I'd recommend it to new managers looking to get up to speed quickly, but with the caveat that you shouldn't use this as your only book. Also, I wasn't too fond of his Create Coalitions chapter, as it straddles the fine line between building consensus and politicing behind the scenes and, in my mind, falls a little on the latter. That's not a technique I'd advise lightly, and particularly not in the first 90 days when you haven't yet figured out nuances of the culture you're working in.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time on Feb. 14, and plan to see it at least one more time before the DVD comes out in may. (I hope!!) <br />I loved it, husband thought it was ok and happy he saw it..once.  It haunts me, I love the type of movie it is anyway.  But everything about it stays with me.  As others have said, I can not get the music out of my head..and not at all unhappy about that. <br />I heard the cd of the London cast, and it was nice and had great voices.  But I think Butler's is the best for the part. It makes one care about the Phantom.  Makes you wish he could be happy, makes you (ok this may only be a female thing. lol) fall in love with the Phantom at the same time you are repulsed by how he controls and even kills. <br />I knew I would like it if only for the music, as I love ANY scores that Webber does.  I have not been able to see any but what he turns into movies, but I have heard, if only on cd's, other of his works and love them all.  But I never dreamed I would fall in love with this movie the way I have. <br />I can not even explain why.  I fear I will wear the DVD out once I do get it.
B000001F6T|3.0|Stonedhenge-- is a very hard Cd to rate. So I will attempt to offer my thoughts and opinions for any curious buyers.  <br />The musicianship is Excellent !! {5 stars}  <br />The production and sound quality is Superior !! {4 stars}  <br />But, where this album fails is in the song writing and in the continuity of how each flows together. The songs are very scattered. Stonedhenge, gives us the trade mark blues rock Ten Years After we are familiar with. Then all of sudden the next song is classical piano piece, then comes a jazz piece, then comes a wierd version of the kiddie nursery ryhme \\"Three Blind Mice\\" which is played strictly on the drums. \\"Now\\" can you see what I mean. Stonedhenge is literally a musical experiment.  <br />If you prefer a very different style of songwriting with a flair for the odd than this will surely capture your interest.  <br />From a musicianship stand piont this is a work of art.  <br />From a songwriting stand piont this is not the normal Ten Years After. Thus the 3 stars rating.  <br />Song variations to consider are:  <br />\\"Gonna Try\\"-- A blues rock song that contains a couple tempo changes and an odd use of some bongos towards the end. On the plus side is some spectacular Keyboard playing.  <br />\\"I Cant Live Without Lydia\\"-- A very short 1:20 minute piano extravaganza that borders on classical.  <br />\\"Woman Trouble\\"-- Solid jazz feel going on. Smooth vocals,Excellent Hammond organ playing and solo as well as an awesome guitar solo. Snare drum technique is impressive. Extra crisp ride cymbal sound.  <br />\\"Hear Me Calling\\"-- A jazz shuffle with driving boogie woogie Bass guitar patterns.Nice two part vocal harmonys.  <br />\\"A Sad Song\\"-- More Blues happening here. Reverb effect on the vocals adds a hint of the mystery to this one. Guitar solo included.  <br />\\"Three Blind Mice\\"-- All drums playing the theme of Three Blind Mice. A short little diddy at that !!  <br />\\"No Title\\"-- Basically a seven minute blues rock jam session. Creative drums. Guitar and keyboards work into a frenzy towards the ending.  <br />\\"Faro\\"-- A 1:09 minute Bass Solo.  <br />\\"Speed Kills\\"-- The last track is a fast shuffle. Boogie woogie bass and Ryhthmic guitar work. Unbelievable snare drum roll technique !! Clean sounding jazz style gutar solo !!  <br /> <br />Final thought: Stick with A Space In Time or Cricklewood Green for a more familiar Ten Years After. However, if you prefer the different experimenting style of Ten Years After then by all means \\"Buy It\\". Songs are still somewhat out of context in my opinion.  <br /> <br />
B000089CJI|4.0|I think the postal service are one of the best new musicians in the growing rock fad known as indie rock, though the place more emphasis on keyboards and the like.  They have wonderful songs that are filled with elctronics and Gibbard's voice, and though it is monotonous, it is interesting and funny also.  \\"such great hights come DOWN now...\\" is one of the best lyrics I have heard for a long time, and a girl I know at school really liked this song after I told her about it, so this could definitely get them somewhere.  Some of the songs are just too weird even for me, so I deduct one star just because there isn't really consistently well written stuff on here.  But it is still very deserving of a place in your collection, and I suggest you check it out soon.  Also check out Death Cab for Cutie and The Shins for similar type tunes, though more rock oriented.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I started out disliking this movie.  I just wasn't laughing much. Napoleon (Jon Heder) is so awkward that it's difficult for his character to gain traction at first.  He's just not very likable - not even in a sad sack sort of way. OK. But it just isn't Napoleon.  His family is an assorted bunch of nuts you've come to expect now in Indie films, and that means there's plenty of dead air and blank stares.  So much so that you're remembering the same \\"realistic\\" devices used in Indie films like \\"Ghost World,\\" \\"The Station Agent,\\" or \\"Welcome to the Doll House.\\"  Don't' get me wrong, I love all those films - but with \\"Napoleon\\" there is a studied sameness that lacks the freshness of those movies.  Whatever.  So why did I like this?  Well, the movie's kind of sneaky in how it accomplishes this.  Basically, Napoleon starts to come out of his shell due to friendships he begins to forge (despite himself) - with kids that are almost as awkward as himself - in particular, Pedro, his best friend, and Deb, his budding love interest  (played effectively by Efren Ramirez and Tina Majorino).  And one virtue Napoleon has is loyalty to his friends. Further, most high schools are overwhelmingly populated by Napoleons, Pedros, and Debs, and not by the beautiful few, who always seem to run the yearbooks and win the class elections.  The end of the movie sealed things for me.  Napoleon, in an act of friendship, shows he has the stuff, and all is right with the world.  This is probably a three star movie, but there is a genuine sweetness that bumps it up one for me.  On top of that, my kids loved it (Napoleon is hugely popular with young teens - and it's not hard to see why).
1400032717|3.0|<br />I just say it straight: if you are only interested in crime and mysterious: leave your hands from this book, you might get really bored even if the title seems to be quite interesting to you. <br />But if you are a person who likes to read about people, their behaviours and especially about those who see the world from a different point of view as Christopher does because he has the Asperger's Syndrom: grab it! <br />You will probably find many interesting aspects while Christopher is on his search for a dog's murderer because the book has some special features which help to understand Christopher's point of view.   <br />
B0006SSOHC|2.0|I went to go see SAW with high expectations and thought I'd leave the theatre with chills!! <br /> <br />..That's not the case. Although it gets off to a good start and does have its creepy moments (such as the elaboration on the situations of the Jigsaw Killer's victims)and the moment where the saws are discovered... But what ultimately killed this movie for me was the horrible acting displayed by the actor playing the doctor (one of the victims trapped). That and the fact that (***SPOILER***) there were two instances where the kidnapper could've easily been killed...those two scenes I found utterly ridiculous because the victims allowed the killer to live. <br /> <br />Just don't set your expectations high for this kind of film. The acting's cringe-wrothy, as is the car-chasing scene with Danny Glover and the Jigsaw Killer's apprentice..
B00008S2VG|1.0|There isn't anything new or ground-breaking on American Life.  Madonna neither has the vocal talent nor writing ability to lift this dull material. She's better off, singing dance songs, like on her self-titled LP, than whining about \\"soy lattes.\\" As in her attempt at rapping, it's laughable.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" twice at the theater and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time.  I don't understand why many critics have not been as enthusuastic.  The cinematography is wonderful, the sets beautiful, and the singing marvelous.  I highly recommend it.  I can't wait for the DVD to come out.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|After reading a lot of very negative reviews on this album, I thought I should hate this album, but I love it and it's hard to say why.  Okay, so maybe Avril is sleazy and greasy and seldom bathes, as one reviewer said.  What difference does it make on a sound CD?  Madonna was very slutty and sleazy at times, but she could sing very well and was extremely popular.  Avril can also sing quite well.  Maybe these aren't great songs and maybe it does sound like she is shouting the lyrics at times or that all the songs sound alike or that the songs are somewhat negative.  It doesn't matter; it's still a very enjoyable album.  There is just something about it that makes it better than average  It has some pizazz, which a lot of albums these days don't.  Avril is fully as good or better than the other teenie booper singers like Brittany Spears or Hillary Duff.  I tried to listen to the LET GO album and it just didn't do for me what this one does. <br />Avril has a bit of an edge or roughness to her voice, which doesn't make it as sweet as some of the other young female singers, but I think that's part of the appeal.  No one particular song stands out on this album as better than any other.  One thing that is clearly demonstrated is that Avril can handle slow and fast songs equally well.  Remarkably good effort for someone just starting out.  It will be interesting to see how Avril evolves and whether she improves or just slips into obscurity.
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook was the best movie of 2004. It was very romantic and cute too! The message of the movie is exceptional. I recommend this movie to anyone.

B00063EMJ6|5.0|While yes, Neil has put out a lot more songs that we all like, the songs on here are all excellent!  The amazing thing to me is the clarity of the songs.  The remastering and sound quality makes these songs sound new and fresh. <br /> <br />Many greatest hits CD's are knocked for not sequentially listing the songs...this one sequentially lists the songs... <br /> <br />Many greatest hits CD's are knocked for not filling up the CD...this one with 17 songs-many long, fills this CD.... <br /> <br />I love some unusual Neil songs like \\"This Notes For You\\", \\"Farmer John\\", \\"Payola Blues\\", \\"Piece of Crap\\", etc...but it clearly states on the CD why the particular songs for this CD were chosen...they were the most requested, listened to Neil Young songs... <br /> <br />If you want a more powerful Greatest Hits CD from Neil with different live version of songs try \\"Live Rust\\" <br /> <br />If you want a more complete Greatest Hits CD buy \\"Decade\\" and a few more CD's... <br /> <br />I would have preferred less CSNY and even Crazy Horse and put on a couple more \\"pure\\" Neil songs...but anyone can nitpick... <br /> <br />This is a great, greatest hits CD...if you already have all the other CD's don't moan, just don't buy it...but you will be missing out on the crystal clear re-mastering effort that makes even thirty year old songs sound new... <br /> <br />Keith S. :{)>
B00003CXDV|4.0|Pay no attention to the jerk whose review follows this one.  Check his other reviews; he gave the BIBLE one star, for goodness' sakes.  What an idiot.    Well, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" ain't holy writ but it's not schlock either.  While it also ain't \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Lord Of the Rings,\\" it's a fun and sometimes clever takeoff on \\"Star Trek\\" with a few former inside jokes that will be familiar enough to almost anyone by now, but there's plenty of twists on the old themes to keep any reasonable audience interested.  It takes the simple idea of, \\"What if the bickering cast of 'Trek' actually found themselves in a 'Trek' plot in real life?\\" and builds on it to the terminally unbelievable conclusion of a plot with so many holes you could fly a few space shuttles through it, but hey, suspending disbelief isn't what this kind of flick is about anyway.  It's a hoot.  Invite some friends over, fluff up some corn, and fire it up with my best wishes.
B0000AQS6U|5.0|The queen of extravaganza and spectacular comebacks sums up on album \\"The Very Best Of\\" astonishing forty years of her career, which brought unforgettable worldwide hits in as many as five decades! No other star achieved this status as a solo artist.    Full version of this compilation was released outside the U.S.A. as an excellent profuse two-CD set with almost all her UK & US hits from all labels she recorded for and some rarities as well. Unfortunately this is a US version, which contains only 21 of her hits, but as its special edition it has also limited special bonus disc with hits recorded live on her farewell tour.    It's an interesting done compilation, but three songs should be replaced by much bigger hits. It could contain all Cher's US Top 10 hits (from both \\"Billboard\\" charts: Hot 100 and Singles Sales) and these US singles, which went to Top 10 only in the UK. 20 songs in total. It means that hits: \\"You Better Sit Down Kid\\", \\"The Way Of Love\\", \\"Love And Understanding\\" and \\"When The Money's Gone\\" should be added instead of less popular \\"Heart Of Stone\\", \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\" and \\"A Different Kind Of Love Song\\".    Fans can also find here two the biggest Sonny & Cher's hits, \\"I Got You Babe\\" and \\"The Beat Goes On\\", what is brilliant completion of this collection.    Cher has released so many collections of hits so far that her every fan should be very exacting in selecting the best one. \\"The Very Best Of\\" is the most perfect, because it sums up forty years of her career. Of course, it's better to choose its comprehensive double CD version with 42 hits. But if you want to have only the most important songs in both studio and live versions, choose this special US edition. It's a music feast for every fan of pop music. That's why Cher is so successful artist so long. Let's enjoy!
B0000027I6|5.0|\\"Amused to Death\\" is definitely not in the same overall musical quality as the Pink Floyd releases from \\"Meddle\\" to \\"The Wall\\", but the lyrical content is definitely comparable. Roger is still churning out brilliant stuff in his old age. His voice seems to have taken a little bit of a dive, or, in my opinion, that's just the way he wanted to sound. I say that because at some points he still hits the high notes as well as he did back in the days of Pink Floyd. At a few points you can really tell it's an old man singing. These are rare and very short lasting, though, so it's not much of a problem. Thankfully some tracks have vocals from various female and male singers to add to the quality of the song. <br /> <br />This is the perfect album for someone looking to escape from the mediocrity of todays mainstream music. The mood and immersion of this album rivals those of classic Floyd albums. The lyrics are very good. The concept is interesting. And, like I said, you'll be completely immersed in the album. The opening \\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", which has a television interview in the background from a WWI vet. He tells his story about Bill Hubbard, a seriously injured man he had to leave in no man's land during the war. It's very emotional, and even depressing. A great start to the album. Right when I heard this song, I knew I was in for a typical Roger Waters album. <br /> <br />That's just the beginning. The album goes from songs about themes related to War and Television. All of which, besides maybe one track, make their point clear. While the music that compliments Roger's brilliant lyrics isn't there like in Pink Floyd, because Jeff Beck and the other various guitarists can't compare to David Gilmour, they still do a good job. One of Jeff Beck's solo, for example, is eerily similar (in some ways) to David's in \\"Comfortably Numb\\". <br /> <br />Be weary that this is an album only for those willing to take the time to grasp it. It's very hard to get into. But if you do give it a chance, and you like intelligent music with an interesting concept, this is a must have. I love to listen to it on my sealed Ear-phones, in a completely dark room while lying in bed. No lie, it was one of the most amazing experiences ever. From the TV sound effects, people talking, and other various sound effects (chopping wood, explosions, etc.), it was a great feeling. Something that is rarely ever felt from music.
B000083E79|5.0|The queen of extravaganza and spectacular comebacks sums up on album \\"The Very Best Of\\" astonishing forty years of her career, which brought unforgettable worldwide hits in as many as five decades! No other star achieved this status as a solo artist.    Full version of this compilation was released outside the U.S.A. as an excellent profuse two-CD set with almost all her UK & US hits from all labels she recorded for and some rarities as well. Unfortunately this is one-CD US version, which contains only 21 of her hits.    It's an interesting done compilation, but three songs should be replaced by much bigger hits. It could contain all Cher's US Top 10 hits (from both \\"Billboard\\" charts: Hot 100 and Singles Sales) and these US singles, which went to Top 10 only in the UK. 20 songs in total. It means that hits: \\"You Better Sit Down Kid\\", \\"The Way Of Love\\", \\"Love And Understanding\\" and \\"When The Money's Gone\\" should be added instead of less popular \\"Heart Of Stone\\", \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\" and \\"A Different Kind Of Love Song\\".    Fans can also find here two the biggest Sonny & Cher's hits, \\"I Got You Babe\\" and \\"The Beat Goes On\\", what is brilliant completion of this collection.    Cher has released so many collections of hits so far that her every fan should be very exacting in selecting the best one. \\"The Very Best Of\\" is the most perfect, because it sums up forty years of her career. Of course, it's better to choose its comprehensive double CD version with 42 hits. But if you want to have only the most important songs of Cher, in both studio and live versions, you can choose special US edition with bonus live disc from her farewell tour. It's a music feast for every fan of pop music. That's why Cher is so much successful artist so long. Let's enjoy!
B00003CXCT|4.0|Even though this DVD boxset is getting torn apart by Star Wars purists (which I'm not) I think this is a solid DVD release. The picture restoration is outstanding and the bonus material is up to the standards of the Episode I and II discs. I won't go into detail since Amazon has listed everything that you need to know. I do have some quibbles however. The first is the sound quality in A New Hope. I'm not sure if it's my old Sony TV (it dates back to the 1980's) but the sound constantly alternates between sounding great and sounding like it does on VHS. Secondly would be some of the changes in the movies. In a way, I like them as they help to bridge the age gap between the old trilogy and the new one. Things like improved ligthsaber effects and cleaned up space sequences are nice but they do, to a certain extent, take away from the classic feel of the old movies. My biggest complaint about the changes is the fact that Hayden Christensen replaces Sebastian Shaw at the end of Jedi.    But shortcomings aside, this release is worth the price. If you aren't a purist, you will like it.    Darkhorse86
B00005JLEU|4.0|In the animated film Spirited Away directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the epic tale of one girl's experience in a mystical and fantasy-driven world is told. This world manifests itself within a bathhouse for spirits, thus becoming the dynamic through which Chihiro (the lonesome and courageous heroine) experiences all of her conflicts and resolutions. Marked by an overriding imagery that is not only picturesque, but creatively and artfully composed, the surroundings that Chihiro is placed within are anything but bleak. While Spirited Away does indeed center around a more serious conflict, one involving Chihiro's struggle to survive within the bathhouse successfully so as to eventually rescue her parents who were formerly turned into pigs, the magical embodiment of the bathhouse and its residents balance this. In many scenes the bright and hopeful hues blue and whit are blended to create an unremitting sky. This, contrasted with the bold and dark colors that boastfully exist within the night-life of the bathhouse, is supportive of a film that is nothing less than a masterpiece of artful animation. Transcending the accepted norms of other contemporary animation pieces, Spirited Away does not only exude a magnificent and mystical story of triumph when in the depths of hopelessness, but also a certain skilled mastery of artistic feats not originally thought possible in the world of animation. Relying on the universal themes of love and friendship, Spirited Away is a film that shatters the preconceived notions regarding the superficiality of most animated films. The fact that most scenes are set against a backdrop that is both intricate and fluent in expressive color and detail only strengthens its impact.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|For a lot of Miyazaki fans from 80s, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind gave them the defining moment of anime experience.  In Japan, though a lot of people did enjoy it, anime had always been seen as a sort of geeky pleasure, only kids and those adults who were a bit recluse and anti-social really got into it.  The quality of Miyazaki's films did really change that landscape (at least for Miyazaki's films).  You'll see why after watching this classic --- Miyazaki was already doing it in early 80s! <br /> <br />The theme of the film reflects the days when Cold War was still in progress, and Miyazaki's own struggle in reconciling the world shared both by the strong and the weak --- he was made deeply uncomfortable by Darwinistic thoughts back in the day.  The world dominated by the poisonous plants and mutated insects instead of human being is the reflection of the thoughts.  Human's greed and misuse of civilization led to their own demise, and it is the human who became the weaker in the world of Nausicaa.  How do the human survive in the world dominated by now antagonistic mother nature?  You'll find out by watching this film!! <br /> <br />If you have seen Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke, you will see the common underlying theme.  However, Nausicaa is much more satisfying in that the film was completed when Miyazaki was still unsure of how human can reconcile their destructive thoughts and actions with the mother nature, of which they are only a tiny part after all.  To me that ambiguity made Nausicaa less preachy. <br /> <br />It is true that the *true* Nausicaa story does not end the way the film version does.  When Miyazaki had to finish the movie, the graphic novel version was still in progress, so the film version does not really end the way Miyazaki really wanted to end; I think he wasn't sure at the time if ending it with a resurrection of messiah of some sort was the best idea.  Anyhow, if you really come to love Nausicaa, I really recommend the graphic novelversion.  The story is a few orders of magnitude more elaborate and enjoyable. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this film to anyone, not just kids.  This is the film that made Miyazaki a very well respected film maker.
078062999X|5.0|Wow!  I'll never think of Hamlet in quite the same way.  Branagh does some of his best work here. (The Shakespeare canon on film would be so lacking without his efforts in bringing the Bard to life.)<br /><br />But...When is this coming out on DVD?  I have the videotape.  I've watched it a dozen times.<br /><br />Can you imagine this breath-taking work on a large screen, high definition DVD?<br /><br />Sigh...I guess we just have to wait...and wait...and wait...
B000003S5H|5.0|As far as chill-out music is concerned, this is this best-crafted release to date. A beautiful listen from beginning to end, \\"Moon Safari\\" is the perfect album for coffeeshops, summer drives through the countryside and a night on the town.  <br /> <br />The French duo has an uncanny way of creating ambient soundscapes that are dreamy as well as lightly energetic. \\"Sexy Boy\\" and \\"Kelly, Watch the Stars!\\" (two big singles from the album) are groove-heavy, yet still retain the style Air's kept these past ten years or so. <br /> <br />While following albums DO keep the trademark Air quality, they fail to sound complete or finished as a good product should. They've had their precious moments, but as far as excellent albums are concerned, their debut is by far the best.
B000002JSP|4.0|I like this album for In The Evening, Carouselambra, All My Love, and Fool in the Rain. South Bound Saurez is alright but I'm not a big fan of Hot Dog or I'm Gonna Crawl. <br /> <br />I'm sure it doesn't hurt that this album came at about the time I really started getting into music on my own account (versus listening to what my parents happened to have on \\"whatya get when ya weerk yer fiingers to the booone? -booonnneey fiingers\\" - yick). I remember hearing a lot of good songs but not necessarily knowing that they were all Led Zeppelin (obviously the backlog was pretty big by the time I started listening to the radio majorly in 1979/1980). I was amazed at the diverse styles the band had, and it was more of an introduction and survey after the fact. So there wasn't really ever a disappointment that they had 'changed' not having been attached to any one style. <br /> <br />In The Evening rips it up IMO. Great vocal delivery, and the muddy mix works in its favor. I love Carouselambra and it's one of my favorite Zep songs though the mix could have been better. While it's not a Siberian Khatru it IS a great prog-rock song, granted some of the synth work is light, but it seems that's how a lot of the synth work was headed in the eighties and nineties. Rick Wakeman's Greatest Hits is a little light IMO. But the song is good and I like the three part scheme to it. Fool In The Rain I remember from the radio and loved it every time it came on. I love the guitar solo and the drumming through out. All My Love transports me to another place, all misty rain and gray and muted greens, but with a sense of optimism underlying it all. <br /> <br />South Bound Saurez I liked when it was played on the radio, but didn't seem to hold up over time. Hot Dog is filler IMO, and I'm Gonna Crawl didn't seem arranged all that well. I understand JP was not all there, but they could at least have tried better or jettison it and put one of the tunes that they put on Coda here instead. <br /> <br/>Overall I like ITTOD better than Presence or III or I. Presence I don't care much for overall, III I appreciate where they were going, but I have to be in a specific mood, and I has some great tunes but just didn't add up to a IV, HOTH, or PG. ITTOD fits much more into the main rotation of LZ albums in my book.
0060763280|5.0|T. Harv Eker takes the information about what it really takes to be wealthy both personally, and financially and put it into perspective.  I read this book in one sitting and I am going to read it again this weekend!  Wow!  Principles that are easy to understand and put into place immediately.  I don't want to miss even one step. <br /> <br />I Highly recommend this book!
B00006879E|4.0|<br />Songs about Jane was not a CD that I enjoyed when I first got.  I was so sick of hearing the singles on the radio.  But, then the song  \\"She Will Be Loved\\" came on my radio and I liked it.  My friend told me to take a second listen to the CD and that I would be impressed if I did.  And he is right I do like it a lot better.  I still skip all the singles even \\"She Will Be Loved\\" because up here they are played to death. The CD is not my favorite, but it is a good CD.  I don't listen to it constantly because it gets annoying fast.  But, I listen to it about once a month.  Which is good for me.  It is worth investing in, because, it gets its moneys worth in play time.   <br />
B0002KVUKW|4.0|Comes off as more of an action/adventure than horror and is best <br />enjoyed if you adjust your expectations accordingly. From Mr. <br />Hyde, to werewolves, to Frankensein's monster, and finally  <br />Count Dracula himself, and lots of sexy vampires, Van Helsing  <br />comes off like Indiana Jones on steroids! Packed with nonstop <br />action and outstanding special effects and visuals. Lots of <br />dark humor, and good fun all around. At a bit over two hours <br />long, it fits in perfectly for an evening of exceptional <br />entertainment. Highly recommended. <br />Thanks, and enjoy, <br />Tom
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah's CD showcases her music wonderfully.  I happened to stumble upon this CD and I enjoy it thoroughly.  I personally like the new one a little better but this one is just as good.  It is perfect, for a frist CD, as it is mature and very well made.  Her voice is great and jazzy and not what you would typically hear on the radio, but she is doing great on the charts--I think that is because she is pure talent!  I recommend this CD along with her new one!
B000002J0B|1.0|Hi everyone, just to add to Zeps long list of rip offs, the riff to The Ocean is taken from an old medieval tune, Dum Pater Familias.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones CD is great.  Her new one showcases  more of her soul.  This is a wonderfully made CD and shows that Norah has even moved up in her music.  I didn't think I would like her as I stumbled upon her first one by accident but I have stuck with her and I am glad I did.  This CD is wonderful.
0141301074|4.0|In one of those strange coincidences of life, I happened to be reading recently about the upcoming movie \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", and noticed that it was based on a story by Roald Dahl.  This was of course after I read everything the article said about Johnny Depp, but I digress.<br /><br />Shortly after that, I picked up a copy of the movie \\"James and the Giant Peach\\" - also from a book by the same author.<br /><br />The final piece fell into place when I attended a book sale, and came across a table of books in the children's section, and lo and behold, there was a selection of books by Roald Dahl, all in readable print with the cute little \\"Puffin\\" logo on them.<br /><br />Needless to say, the cashier thinks I have a lot of kids who like to read, as I didn't exactly let on that I was buying this huge pile of children's books for myself.<br /><br />This book is a lightning-quick read, even for a child, and it's full of gross hygiene deficiencies, practical jokes and mischievous monkeys. Mr. Twit has the nastiest, ugliest beard known to mankind, the only thing nastier and uglier being Mrs. Twit with her glass eye.  They take pleasure in playing horrible practical jokes on each other, being unpleasant to their four pet monkeys, and catching birds to make bird pie.<br /><br />Of course, nasty people cannot be expected to come to a good end, and the monkeys craftily strategize to turn the tables on the horrible couple.<br /><br />The underlying moral here is that no matter what you look like physically, if you have good thoughts, they will shine right through and make you a beautiful person, and of course the opposite also unfortunately applies.<br /><br />Be nice to someone today and let the sunlight stream from your face.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 17, 2005
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This movie was so good. It was so better than Alexander the great. This kills. They could never have got a better cast. The battle scenes are awesome. all the actors did a wonderful job. They should make more movies like this.
0761119752|5.0|Sandra Boynton's books have become new favorites in our household with our 2 1/2 year old.  We must have seven or eight of them now and everyone is read with regularity.  Sandra's style of prose and illustration has a great appeal to toddlers with its silly, whimsical style.  Pajama Time of course it all about getting your little ones in their PJs and off to bed.  In typical Boynton style we see several happy-go-lucky animals playing outside as it gets dark and the moon rises.  Time to come inside and get those PJs on!<br /><br />The story is of course told in Sandra's signature rhyming style...take this line about pajamas:<br /><br />\\"Some are old<br /><br />and some are new.<br /><br />Some are red<br /><br />and some are blue\\"<br /><br />Bright, bold colors are always choice attractions in Sandra's books and here we have pigs, hippos, cats, and more all getting ready for bed and dancing about before finally settling down for the night in bed.  Even the text becomes smaller, indicating a softer tone to send your little one on to dreamland.<br /><br />Another winner from Sandra!
B00068IOWM|5.0|As one who is about the same age as Bono and has been listening to the band since they first hit America with Boy, IMHO this is their best album, yet.  While I am a long-time fan, I am not a fanatic.  Unlike some vocal critics, I like how they have continually evolved their act and writing.  I'm glad they didn't just keep doing retreads of War or Achtung.   <br /> <br />Now, with All That ... & How To ... their songwriting craft has risen to an even higher level.  They are writing classic songs that are timeless and can be interpreted in any genre.  Additionally, they play with such confidence and skill it seems effortless and deceptively simple.  In particular, the bass playing is Adam Clayton's best work.   <br /> <br />This is a record that will have special appeal to more mature listeners without an agenda.  Listening to it, I was compelled to go through their entire catalog and listen to it all again.  Without question, the trend of their music has been upward, leading to this.  Elements of all they've done in the past is here, tempered by a new maturity of their earnestness.  Nevertheless, this is not a regression to, or a recapitulation of the past.  These last two albums are the start of U2 hitting a new plateau; moving beyond being a rock band (albeit one the best in the world), to being (simply) a band.   <br /> <br />The songs improve with repeated listenings.  How many artists can claim that?  These guys are doing thier best work, ever.   <br /> <br />Buy it, load it on your iPod or Zen, and enjoy it for a very long time. <br />
0765309408|5.0|I know that many of the reviewers have stated that this book was like Heinliens \\"Starship Troopers\\". Well yes it was, but also to me it had the flavor of Haldemans \\"Forever War\\".  <br /> <br />I am not a book critic, just a lover of SciFi. Being that this is the first SciFi novel written by Mr. Scalzi I was impressed that he wrote as well as Mr. Heinlien. If he keeps this up I will be a life long fan of his as I am Mr. Heinlien's. <br /> <br />Everyone else that has written a synopsis of this book has said it better than I could. I Just want to stress to everyone interested in this book that if you like a fast paced military scifi read, then this is a very safe read. <br /> <br />I just wish I could be a \\"beta tester\\" of his future works.
B00004Z459|5.0|As far as the Nu-Rock craze goes this is as good as it gets. Guitar riffs and lyrics that yu can't get out of your head, anger that hits new heights, and vocals that are amazing. This cd is solid from top to bottom. Everyone knows what linkin park is like by now. Either you like them or you dont. If you do, then it doesnt get any better than this. When i was having a tough time in high school and this cd first came out, I would put this on and blare it for hours. It is one of those cds that u just cannot put down. If you dont have it yet go get it now.
B00023B1LM|4.0|I have been a fan of this movie since it first came out, so when they annouced a new EXPLOSIVE EXTENDED EDITION, I got real excited and couldn't wait to own it, now I do, and guess what? Really, really desapointed in this dvd.<br />The movie is still great of course, but the EXTENDED version is nothing to brag about... first of all, the actual deleted scenes which you can access on the special features menu of the original dvd and this version dvd, are not included in the EXTENDED VERSION... and the only 2 clips that are added, are a new begining and alternate ending. These last two new clips need to be accesed by pressing an icon which appears while the movie is playing, and the switch is cheaply done; lacking the original movies quality...<br />It would have been nice if the Extended version would have been made up without the PRESS THE ICON feature, and WHAT do they mean by EXPLOSIVE???? The only excitement and action is in the original movie.... nothing else.<br />This is a real rip off in my opinion. If you own the old version; stick with it... this new version is REALLY NOT WORTH IT!!!!
B000002H7I|5.0|I am totally a new devotee to Tracy...  Other than 'Fast Car' and 'Give me one good Reason', I had never heard any other music of hers.  I have to agree with the last review and say that it is a darn shame that some of her other work has not been as noticed.  Oh well....the ones of us who are willing to give good music a chance have some of the best music around to listen to with her.  Crossroads is an awesome buy ~~Highly Recommended~~
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I purchased American Idiot about a month ago I honestly didn't listen to it that much at first. Of course I knew the singles \\"America Idiot\\" and \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" but I didn't take the time to sit down and really listen to the CD, however when I finally did I was literally blown away. I'm not going to sit and critique each track, but I am going to say that Idiot is the best album I've purchased in years. Each track has an original and unique sound to it. The group is in top form musically and one can almost feel the passion that lead singer Billie Joe puts into each song. I love this album and would highly recommend it to anyone.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Everyone has that special movie about which it is impossible to be objective. This is that movie for me. I saw it first when my son was seven and he brought it home when a schoolmate loaned it to him. It instantly became a favorite in our house. My son, my daughter, and I have a special bond that this film signifies to this day. From the moment Belle sings, \\"I want much more than this provincial life,\\" you know you are going to have an experience that goes beyond the ordinary, and you get one that goes beyond your wildest dreams. This film goes into superlatives that leave you breathless.    It is hard to list all the summa cum laudes in this film. Disney broke new ground in this film by using a UNIX workstation for the ballroom scene that enabled a three-dimensional representation of the dance sequence, showing Belle and the Beast dancing through the ballroom under the chandelier. The movie features the voices of Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Jerry Orbach (Lumire), David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), Chip (Bradley Pierce), and Wardrobe (Joanne Worley). Alan Menken's musical score is outstanding; the title song won the 1991 Best Song Oscar. The combination of a winning score, superb animation, and an unusually magical depth that the cast manages to create -- the viewer will be too spellbound while watching it to be able to say what it is that captivates so totally -- makes this film one that is not to be missed by young and old alike.    The story is a traditional tale of a prince turned into a beast by a spell cast by an enchantress. The spell can be broken only if, by the end of his 21st birthday, he falls in love with someone who will also love him. An enchanted rose blooms as a symbol of the spell, and the last petal will fall at the end of the spell.     The beauty is a beautiful woman, Belle, in a small French village, who is very intelligent and reads voraciously. She spends much of her time dreaming of living in the worlds she reads about in the books, any place other than the provincial village life she knows. She lives with her father, Maurice, a rather eccentric inventor, and both of them seem to be regarded as odd and unconventional types by the village residents. Gaston, a handsome but arrogant hunter, hopes to marry Belle for no other reason than to be able to say that he has married the most beautiful woman in the village; it is a matter of ego more than feeling, because he admits to no real feeling for anyone other than himself.    Maurice heads out for a fair but goes astray from the path and ends up at a castle. The castle turns out to be enchanted, and the ornaments at the castle turn out to be lifelike beings who welcome him. Cogsworth, the pompous clock, Lumire, the romantic candlelabra, Mrs. Potts, the motherly teapot, and Chip, the boyish teacup, all welcome him. All is well until the master, the surly, growling Beast, enters the room, shouting that Maurice is not welcome and takes him prisoner. At a later time in the film, when Belle comes looking for her father, Belle begs the Beast to let her take her father's place, so she becomes the Beast's prisoner.    The clash of the high-spirited Belle and the ill-tempered Beast is inevitable, for when the Beast loses his temper with Belle and frightens her, she tries to flee him. Wolves try to attack her, and the Beast comes to her rescue. Somehow the incident draws them together, and the resistance slowly causes the two to start to relate to one another. Before long, the two have become very close. The Beast allows Belle to look into his enchanted mirror, and she sees her father is quite ill. When the Beast sees how distressed Belle is, he releases her.    When Belle goes back to her father, she realizes that her feelings for the Beast have changed. As she and Maurice discover, Gaston, in an attempt to intimidate Belle into marrying him, have plotted to put Maurice into an insane asylum. When Gaston discovers that Belle has developed affections for the Beast, he leads the townspeople on a lynch to destroy the Beast.    As the lynch mob approaches the castle, all the objects in the castle prepare for the onslaught. Furniture, kitchen utensils, decorations, virtually every object in the castle, turn on the townspeople, and defeat them in the battle. They rejoice in their victory in the end.    The only persons left in the battle are Gaston and the Beast. The Beast is so depressed because he has lost Belle that he does not resist and lets Gaston assault him. Suddenly Belle appears, and the Beast rises up against Gaston, throwing him from the castle roof. The Beast is in Belle's arms, dying, as Belle tells him that she loves him. Suddenly, in those last moments, the last petal of the rose falls and the spell is broken. The Beast is transformed into a man. The objects again become human, and the movie ends happily.    Somehow at all the right moments in the film, the songs come in to give the story a push forward. Whether it is the opening song that introduces Belle and explains why she can never be content with the life in her little viilage, the song of the conceited Gaston that tells why he can think of nobody in the world except himself, the song that signals the turning point in the relationship between Belle and the Beast, or the title song itself, the music graces the film in the most miraculous way. The film went on to become a Broadway hit as well, and one of the songs from the Broadway play, \\"Human Again,\\" that was not in the original movie was added in later versions.    Too often when the words \\"entertainment for the whole family\\" are used, the words mean \\"boring and awful.\\" Many adults also think of animated films as too juvenile to be good. Such prejudices should be cast aside when viewing this film; it is pure pleasure from start to finish.
B000005RS0|5.0|This is the new and enhanced version of Tina's 1984 \\"PRIVATE DANCER\\" album. Through the years this album has been changing because of the big demand and great selling history. The original version from 1984 only included 9 tracks and then when cd's came out, \\"HELP\\" was added. Now with this ultimate version you can enjoy 4 bonus tracks (\\"I WROTE A LETTER\\", \\"ROCK N' ROLL WINDOW\\", \\"DON'T RUSH THE GOOD THINGS\\" and \\"WHEN I WAS YOUNG\\"). This songs are from Tina's comeback effort in the early 80's. The songs are ok but I think that they're kinda weak for such a great album, but well as bonus tracks they pass (I mean this because if you know much about Tina you can see that she still doesn't find herself very much as a rock singer, this is the period where she moves from soul, r&b and a bit of rock to just rock, where Tina didn't stay 100% because she's more a pop/rock singer). Then within the additional tracks you can find 3 remixes from \\"WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT\\", \\"BETTER BE GOOD TO ME\\" and \\"I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN\\". Now this additionals are great. <br />The booklet has also been enhanced with new great pictures but there's also one thing that I regret. That, the original cover photo from this production, the one where Tina appears seated in some kind of sparkled platinum hillock showing her whole fantastic legs (but well that photo appears inside the booklet. If you see it I'm more than sure that you'll agree with me), has been changed sience the late 80's to the one where she appears with a cat. <br />Well I had commented what I didn't like very much from this new version but I also have to tell what makes this album so great and famous. This was the best-selling album of 1984-85 in the world with sales of 15 million, it brought Tina back in the spotlight, brought her 6 Grammy nominations (she won 4), made Grammy history when she was nominated for 3 Grammys in 3 different music categories for Best Female Vocal Performance in Rock for \\"BETTER BE GOOD TO ME\\", Pop for\\"WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT\\" and R&B for \\"LET'S STAY TOGETHER\\". Brought Tina her first #1 hit with \\"WHAT'S LOVE\\" (which was also chosen by Billboard as the #1 song of 1984), it also brought her 4 Top 10 hits in the U.S (\\"LET'S STAY TOGETHER\\", \\"BETTER BE GOOD TO ME\\", \\"WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT\\" and \\"PRIVATE DANCER\\") and it Europe got 5 Top 10 hits (the named and \\"I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN\\"). \\"I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN\\" wasn't released in America, when the fifth single was to come out at that time, Capitol chose \\"SHOW SOME RESPECT\\" for America and \\"I CAN'T STAND THE RAIN\\" for Europe. <br />This production is very special because it shows a big difference in Tina's performances if you compare it with her early solo productions and her productions with Ike. The song that opens the album, \\"I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUEEN\\" is a great track and I find it very hard to believe that it wasn't a single, then track 8, \\"STEEL CLAW\\" is Tina's most rock n' roll track ever. <br />I think that this album is a must have, even if you have Tina's 2005 biggest hits compilation \\"ALL THE BEST\\", you can find here amazing songs that you won't find there. I'd also recommend you her 1989 album \\"FOREIGN AFFAIR\\" (that's my Tina's favorite). <br />
B0001AP12G|3.0|I've read a lot of the reviews.  Here's my perspective: screw mainstream and screw underground.  Screw the labels.  There are a lot of people with low musical talent signed to the mainstream labels as well as the underground.  It seems like the two labels are broken into: underground = conscious and skills while mainstream = materialism and no skills.  I don't agree with either.  That's for another debate.  I like music - period.  I love hearing Talib, Quannum, and Sage Francis as much as I do listening to Nas, Ludacris, and Jay-Z. <br /> <br />I never really bought into Kanye's hype.  I don't have MTV and I don't listen to the radio much, but I liked his production on The Blueprint and some various West Coast cuts by Snoop and Knocturnal.  I wanted to get his CD when it came out for whatever reason I waited until this week. <br /> <br />If I could, I would've given it a 2.5 stars - right down the middle.  At first listen, I thought the production was good (definitely not his BEST stuff) and his content had enough critical thinking in it to make up for the subpar delivery.  At that point I would've given the CD 4 stars for a pleasant-listening experience despite the subpar delivery. <br /> <br />Now, after attempts at 2nd and 3rd or 4th listens, I consider the CD a bit lame.  I think he hits once in a while with a line or two. His content is still admirable though after a few listens I'm not sure how sincere he is.  The beats do get old.  The songs I check for most now are the ones that have already received commercial success: Jesus Walks, All Falls Down, and Through the Wire (which ironically seems to have the most consistency in delivery than his other songs).  The lyrics are okay - some better than others, I can live with them.  The beats I can listen to also.  The delivery really alters the whole experience that the content can't save. <br /> <br />Aside from the music, I believe that the paths to success are diverse and life experience is the truest form of education we can ever hope to get.  That said, despite college and higher education not being everyone's path, it seems to me that Kanye's anger towards the system is more of an ego-driven \\"I told you so\\" shouted towards the people who didn't believe his musical prowess.  It's okay, man, make peace with it.  You've made it, Kanye.  Channel that frustration towards educating others, man.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie. I am so glad I did not let the negative reviews persuade me of my expectations for this brilliant movie. I just like to say Gerard,Emmy,Patrick and Minnie did a wonderful job. I have been listening to the soundtrack non-stop since I last saw the movie. I just preordered my copy of the dvd and I think tonight I will see the movie again for the 3rd time:).
B00006ZXSK|4.0|This is one of my favorite films. Wonderfully romantic, beautiful setting, and good moral.  Unfortunatley, I do not buy into the profanity used in the film.  Not necessary.  Also I thought Scott Dougray looked a bit old but he did a great job in his role anyway.  Maybe guys married older while women married younger back in those days.  As for the accuracy of Leonardo Da Vinci being in France, he really did go to France to be the resident artist of the French king around that time. Any way, this film is worth it.
B000000WJK|5.0|The Verve just know how to play music.  If you want a trippy experience that will enlighten you on what a storm in heaven might sound like, then get this album.  Best if listened to in a mellow setting without other noise interference.  The psychedelics will leave your mental senses on the brink of orgasm.
B000070IXT|1.0|First of all the CG sucked. Second, Michelle Rodriguez can't act. She rolls her eyes to the back of her head with every line as if to make it more intense and stronger, it doesn't work. The movie doesn't really follow the game much. And although I never thought about this until I heard someone else say it, why would the computer send out all those little lasers and not just the \\"net laser\\" if it's job was to kill any and everything? The answer is, so they can include more unecessary action without incorporating it more smoothly and intelligently.<br /><br />If you want to see a good zombie flick, rent the original Night of the Living Dead.
B000000W8C|5.0|At first I thought this albumn was disappointing when compared to \\"A  Storm in Heaven\\" and \\"Urban Hymns.\\"  I had to play it a couple times to really get into it, but now I can't take it out of my CD player.  It definitely does not take a back seat to any other albumn I've ever listened to.  I regret my initial judgment, but I often need to listen to an albumn a few times before I get its vibe.  If you are thinking about buying this because you like \\"Urban Hymns\\", stop thinking and buy it - you won't regret it.
B00006CXGM|5.0|This is a film that is not only going to keep you gasping for your breath from laughter, but will also keep you wonder what can possibly happen next. The cast should speak for itself. If you have never seen this movie or \\"Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels\\", you need to get off line and rent or buy them now. I could not possibly begin to describe the quality of this film. Vinny Jones and Brad Pitt have a couple of the funniest lines that I have ever heard in any film. There are two many great actors and small stories that lead into one grand finish.
B000268QB2|5.0|i heard somehwere only we know over radio - loved it, check out the other samples - bought it, played the CD over and over again - never regretted. For a person like me who only buy CDs because they are too good to be downloaded and put in a mixed CD, this album is awesome. I love it when i just blast my speakers while i do my leisure reading. There's a feel of 'roundness' as the songs flows from one to another till bedshaped, which gave it a perfect ending... i shall blast it once again now
0321012542|5.0|This is truly a great book.  Not only does it contain all of Shakespeare's works but it also has an enormous amount of information.  There's a little bit on his life and a bit more about the theater during his time. There are also some great drawings in the beginning of the book.
6304030959|1.0|I have this movie on video...and it's not even worth watching it anymore since it's played over and over on every cabel network.  The only time this movie made an impact on me was when I saw it at the cinema.
B0002858YS|4.0|I was wondering when a band was going to immerse us with the  synth-rock-ala-80's sound again and all I can say is it's about time! The Killers are wonderful and \\"Hot Fuss\\" is about as good as a debut album gets.  <br /> <br />\\"Mr. Brightside\\" sounds like it could have come right off Blondie's \\"Eat To The Beat\\" album from 1979. It reminded me very much of the song \\"Dreaming\\" but even better. It is the true highlight of the CD and rightfully so.  <br /> <br />\\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" sounds reminiscent of the Psychedelic Furs \\"President Gas\\" but it's not a complete take on the song.  The beauty of this release is that it does not try to copy any one particular band of years gone by, but effortlessly pays homage to them instead. I specifically hear The Smiths, Echo & The Bunnymen, The P-Furs, and early Blondie in their music which leads to the question: Could their taste be any better?    <br /> <br />Listening to this CD brought me back to high school and the new wave era that was underway at the time in the early and mid 1980's that I loved so much. The best part was it is new music chock-full of an old sound that got such a bad rap. In fact if you compare New Wave to today's mediocre to poor over produced numbers and artists it truly shines through.  <br /> <br />All of the songs are excellent for the most part with the exception of \\"Andy You're A Star\\" - I've listened to it several times and I just don't care for it but it could just be personal taste. Not bad considering I can't think of a time when I can say I've more than liked all of the soongs on a CD except \\"one\\".        <br /> <br />I look forward to more from \\"The Killers\\" and I only hope that their \\"what's old is new again\\" sound carries on for some time to come. They are fresh, fun and deserving of any success that comes their way.       <br />
0800196767|5.0|What a beautiful movie this is!  I read the book a few times before seeing the movie...and I would totaly reccomend seeing the movie and reading the book.
0694003611|5.0|We are now on our third well-loved copy of this book.  I originally bought the book when my son was a toddler, and it quickly became his favorite bed-time story.  My daughter carried on the family-tradition of having this story read to her each night. <br /> <br />By now I know the entire story by heart, and on occassion will recite it on car trips to help settle the kids.  The book itself is lovely, but the cadence of the words are so gentle and seem to lull any child that hears it into a sweet slumber.  I've actually just recited the story to my youngest (6 month old) niece, and she fell asleep in my arms just listening to the words. <br /> <br />A wonderful addition to any child's library!
B00008HCCF|2.0|I attended the NewOrleans concert and it was so much fun to be there in person.  This dvd is good  but severley edited - and it definitly dosn't match up to the magic of seeing Norah and her band perform live!

B00005T30L|5.0|This movie is so great at making its charecters realistic and relatable to those of us who don't fit in or conform to society.  There's so many references to how the media influences people's  decisions in what they buy, music they listen to, etc.  Years from now people will still identity wit this movie.
6305003882|5.0|Excellent! excellent! excellent!<br /><br />Di Caprio is superb!<br /><br />The story is great and make us think about life.
B0002X314C|5.0|After a slew of hip-hop and a couple of video game reviews I've done, you'd think I'd stay the beaten path. But the truth is that rap and R&B is becoming so entwined, it's awkward telling the difference anymore. Heck, there aren't even many duets to speak of nowadays, since singers are more eager to hook up with rappers; that's why everyone got excited over \\"My Boo\\". While it's kinda the case here in Legend's album (Snoop Dogg?), it's rounded out by Kayne's dusty samples, Legend's stellar piano work, and (naturally) his voice. Whether you love or hate \\"Ordinary People\\" (and yes, I've seen people that are sick of the song), you can't deny the boy's pipes. I was awestruck when I heard it, reminding me of a black Elton John in a way. And that's a good thing. When I finish this review (go ahead and groan; like I said, I got a life too) you'll hear my justification of the classic status. But judging by the 5-star reviews ALREADY posted, don't be too surprised.(TO BE COMPLETED)<br /><br />P.S.: Notice that I didn't have a pun this time?
0446677450|1.0|I read the book and invested in Content Management Stock. Now I am poor, my wife left me and my car got stolen. But at least I have time to watch my superman movies along with my friend, the Invisible Man.
1400032717|4.0|The curious incident of the dog in the night-time <br /> <br /> <br />The novel \\"The curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" deals with a boy named Christopher who has the Asperger's syndrome. One night he finds his neighbour's dog lying on the ground dead. Christopher wants to find out who the murderer was. <br />While I was reading the story I tried to pick up some information about the Asperger's syndrome. As a result I can say that Mark Haddon wrote a terrific novel from an Asperger's syndrome's patient's point of view. <br />Although I think the ending is too long, it is a very interesting book for people who like funny novels with a touch of crime and maths. <br /> <br />
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Whatever your views are of Robert McNamara he is certainly engaging, articulate, and spirited in this fascinating and well-crafted Errol Morris film. The discerning viewer will appreciate the attention to detail here with its skillful editing and haunting footage as well as the superb but not overdone Philip Glass soundtrack. Ten years from now, even twenty years from now, it will remain highly watchable.
B000687M48|4.0|I was really looking forward to watching this DVD.  However, I have to agree with the other reviews on here.  I didn't time anything but I swear that there was a cut every 5 seconds...the longer cuts were of the audience!  If they did decide to grace us with a shot of Amy singing it was from the crowd with hands in the way!  And the bonus \\"behind the scenes\\" material is nothing special.  If you are a diehard fan you will appreciate it, but if you are a passing fan you will probably not enjoy watching Amy rollerblade, throw furniture in a bathroom and burp. These are not drunken rock and roll antics...but the antics of some high school seniors with a video camera.  Anway, I love the live CD! Love the music videos! But please give us a real concert DVD....not edited by someone with their finger on the cut button.
B00018TI5E|3.0|Shadows Collide With People definitely comes across as very personal work by John Frusciante.  The lyrics are extremely heartfelt (see \\"Second Walk\\" or \\"I Regret My Past\\") and the music is beautifully executed. <br /> <br />What puts me off a bit from this record is that John Frusciante reveals his melancholy side, but seems to reveal only that side of himself.  JF is capable of some beautifully savage yet surgically precise music, which slaps you in the face but deeply moves you at the same time.  Many songs on this album are dominated by him strumming an acoustic guitar with pop abandon, belting out his soulful lyrics. <br /> <br />This isn't a bad thing, and comes across very well, but the songs tend to blend together about half way through the album.  Also, I feel (and this will be sacrilegeous to fans) that the lyrics and song structures could have been tighter -- it does ramble occasionally. <br /> <br />The last thing that bugs me a bit is JF's singing.  Don't get me wrong, he is a fantastic singer and certainly is worthy of having a great solo career.  I just feel that more modulation in his singing would have helped the songs tremendously.  In every one of them, he sings at the same volume, same pitch, occasionally veering into the trademark soft roar that gives Red Hot Chili Pepper songs so much more texture.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is great radio-friendly pop-rock.  Even the more experimental tracks are readily accessible.  I was expecting a bit more experimentation from the true artist that is John Frusciante, that's all. <br /> <br />Still highly recommended, especially if you're into more middle of the road stuff (think U2 etc.) and are looking for solid catchy songs with a bit of an edge to them.
0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men was a really good novel. The author did a great job. I think the author's purpose for writing this book was to point out that even though you love someone so much, when they do something wrong it is still wrong. You just have to make the decision. I agree with this message because it can pertain to anyone. From friends, to family and relationships, this message is understandable and in people's lives more than you know it. I think the literary elements the author handles best are the characterization, and the conflict of man vs. man. The characters in the novel are so real and dramatic. The authorhas a great point-of-view, which is in 3rd person. By using a narrator, you can see everyone's thoughts, feelings, and perspectives on the situation throughout the novel. The genre chosen for this novel, to me, was drama. it is a very good genre because you want to know what is going to happen next. this book was like i said, really good, but it wasn't perfect. There were too many curse words and so much criticism that it was just kind of mean. Lenny and George are the main characters but I think the author should've explained the relationship between them better. He should have also pointed out George's point-of-view on the \\"sticky\\" situation a little more. Overall, this novel is great and everyone should get the chance to read it. For those reasons I give it 4 stars. Hey, it's a book to read and not forget, but too much reality for perfection.
B000286RNY|5.0|I first rented this movie and it was so good.  I like the idea of competition and the action choreography and martial arts/kung fu acts are so amazing.  A lot better than some of the american action-comedy movies. Aside from the coolest martial art moves, it was soooo funnny!Now, I have my own DVD and I have also bought several DVDs of Stephen Chow! HE ROCKS!  I'm looking forward to watch his new movie, KungFu Hustle.  I'll definitely watch it.
B000002U82|3.0|I have listened to Pink Floyd since there inception.Their original and experimental music was landmark in a forest of mediocre rock bands in the late 60's and early '70's. Yes, they were searching for the right, distinct sound for themselves. Howevever each previous album, even with multiple flaws provided some interesting music. It seemed that when Dark side of the Moon appeared, you could tell they had decided to go mainstream. They probably had it up to their necks with mixed reviews. But for my money, albums like Atom Heart Mother socked me harder. There was something shocking and wonderful in the orchestra-side intro. A true masterpiece! You would have to go back in time and listen to it during the albums debut to truly appreciate it. Dark Side has some great numbers, but tunes like \\"Money\\" sounded like they were stretching to hit the charts. Unfortunately the album has been played to death for me to enjoy much of it now, but the live concert DVD is fairly exiting.

B0001I55OC|2.0|OK, so I've spent a worse 2 hours than watching Timeline, but I must still confess to feeling curiously empty and unsatisfied. <br /> <br />Not having read the Crichton novel, I had no particular preconceptions about the movie and, being a sucker for the time travel motif, was looking forward to some thought-provoking, visionary and moving sci-fi. <br /> <br />Instead, I got a very lightweight story, peppered with irritating anachronisms, such as the inhabitents of 14th century France speaking perfectly understandable modern French and/or English. <br /> <br />The now routine Hollywood anglophobia started to bug me after a while (anyone with an English accent is a callous butcher) and, it has to be said, Billy Connoly CANNOT ACT. He hammed it up no end in The Last Samurai, and he does so here again.  There also seemed to be some serious continuity issues with his ever-changing beard-length! <br />   <br />Anna Friel's music-hall comic French accent fails to convince, and the Canadian landscape simply doesn't look French. <br /> <br />Worst of all though, is the sheer lack of WONDER generated by the time-travel sequences.  Maybe this is faithful to the book, in that the main characters have no time to explore and find themselves fighting for their lives as soon as they reach medieval France, but it all felt rather uninspiring to me. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the battle sequences were competently executed,  the trebuchet siege machines being  genuinely impressive.  I am not convinced that 20th century archaeology students would have mastered the lost art of broadsword fighting within 48 hours though! <br /> <br />To summarise; I've seen worse movies - but not that many. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000006045|5.0|This album, music unlike any other, is what made music from Waterlog and their Brained Off Drugs\\" album great!

0790731452|1.0|They can't even give this pile of dross away in the 2-99 bargain bucket any more.  Why? Because word has got around that it is a complete waste of 100 minutes. <br /> <br />Never funny enough to work as comedy and certainly not intelligent enough to work as satire, let alone sci-fi, Mars Attacks fails miserably on all accounts. <br /> <br />Cackhanded direction generates not even a wry grin from the very weak and thinly spread visual gags, and the (surprisingly strong) cast appear to be just going through the motions.  What on Earth were Nicholson and Close thinking of when they got involved with this turkey? <br /> <br />The lowest point in Tim Burton's career. <br />

B0000CFW87|1.0|Mr. Groban is an egregious musical FAILURE. As a longtime listener and sincere fan of all things musical, I can say that this warbling isn't musical. His voice is weak and lacking on so many levels it is rediculous. To the reviewer that had the audacity to compare Mr. Groban to Luciano Pavarotti: SHAME!   To those thinking of buying this album: investigate other classic baritones and tenors, and for that matter-CLASSICAL MUSIC!! Do not limit yourself to this garbage, but rather stray from the darkness and into the light that is anything BUT Josh Groban. I suggest you read MaestroMike's review for a scholarly look into the proverbial cow dung with which Josh Groban has stained the musical market.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I can only echo what has been said before. FireFly is a stunning achievement from start to finish. A truly original and brilliantly written show, killed off by short-sighted TV execs. How this project wasn't given a chance to flourish when Joss Whedon and crew had delivered the goods for years with Buffy is beyond me completely! We can only hope the movie will be a success and FireFly will live again on TV and be given the chance it always deserved.

B00002Z88D|3.0|The obvious has to be stated with this album: it doesnt measure up to the actual concert experience.  It will be difficult for casual fans and die-hards alike to appreciate Metallica + Orchestra by listening to a CD recording.  That's the unavoidable fact that holds this album back.  Otherwise, this is essentially a greatest hits album with 1.5 very good songs thrown in that, absent the concert hall, will make it difficult to appreciate either Metallica or the orchestra.
B000268QB2|5.0|The first song and the first North American release of this album, &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; was stuck in my head, most particularly after being impressed with the band's performance on Saturday Night Live.  I took a chance and bought their CD and haven't been able to get it out of my mind since.  I take it with me to work, play it in my car, and drift off to sleep listening to it.  Every song has a unique value and if you purchase it, you won't be disappointed with any track on the album.
B0000009TT|5.0|As an individual that actually survived and therefore lived the 60s/70s I must recommend this compilation/concert as an extraordinary work of art from, perhaps, one of the top 5 composers of the 20th century. <br /> <br />Much of what I would say about Mr. Zappa has been said already - most of which is correct. <br /> <br />However, for you music majors out there, LISTEN to the humor music, the political arguments, the appeal to the teeny bopper lyrics. MANY of these \\"tunes\\" contain motifs, full themes and previews of orchestrations yet to be heard by the general public. <br />(Yes, even though we are musicians we are indeed part of the general public.) <br /> <br />To EVERYONE - this album (does that show my age?) is exemplary of the man and the composer that was Frank Zappa. <br /> <br />A MUST HAVE FOR ANY THAT APPRECIATE THE ART OF MUSIC!!
0066214122|5.0|I usually take months to finish a book.  This book I finished in under a month and loved every minute of it.   <br />This was the first Michael Crichton book I have read and was surpised to find how he can go into enough detail that I a computer programmer didn't feel he was making up complete nonsense but yet felt that non-technical people would get the same level of depth and meaning from his words.  He's a talented author. <br />I thought I would find this book a bit of nonsense, but instead I caught myself quickly wrapped up in the story.  He throws hints around and lets you feel like a genius by figuring somethings out yourself which keeps you reading further.   <br />I don't want to spoil this wonderful book for anybody, so all I will say is if you enjoy suspense or mysteries definitely check this one out.
0440237688|4.0|In my opinion the book The Giver, by Lois Lowry is a good read. There is an Orwellian feel to this book. If you liked 1984, then this is the book for you. <br />The book The Giver by Lois Lowry creates a utopian society in which the main character Jonas lives. The community is based on the fact that every citizen has a purpose, and although this may seem as the ideal situation, each citizen serves only that purpose. This community is based on structure, not allowing for variables such as individualized birthdays or love in a romantic sense. The leader of the community is called the Receiver. The receiver holds all the memories of the community.  This is the most important job in the community. <br />Each year a ceremony is held that determines the future for every 12 year old in the community. This is a bit extreme when you consider that most 20 year olds don't know what their future is today.  When the Ceremony of twelve occurs each child is given their assignment, and from then on they focus on the training of their assigned occupation.  Upon receiving his assignment Jonas is given his assignment as the Receiver. His job is important because the community trusts him to make major decisions based on his memories. Jonas accepts his assignment, although the more he learns, the more he hates his society. This book gives you a view at what the world could be if the phrase \\"every man is created equal\\" is taken to the extreme.  A world where the basics such as food and shelter are well provided for, yet the basics such as emotion and desire are non existent. This may seem idealistic, yet aren't those the things that make us human? <br />
B000002N2P|5.0|I'm a huge green day fan have every cd. been listening to them since 1994 when i was 11. this cd though has always been my favorite. fast, catchy and musically awesome. every gd cd is great but this one is my favorite. especially if youre a 20 something self-loather like me.
B00004XPPB|5.0|\\"Donnie Brasco\\" is definitely one of my top 10 movies.  It's not so much because it's a movie about the Mafia, but because the humanizing performance both Pacino and Depp give in this memorable film.<br /><br />Of course, the story is simply great -- and made for the movies -- because it's based on a true story.  Some of the events seem a little farfetched; e.g., when Lefty queries Donnie about the boat and then just walks away from it.  But somehow, the film never loses its magnetism, as it keeps the audience guessing and worrying about the agent's fate, and Lefty's fate.<br /><br />Pacino's performance here is one of his best.  There's a bit of over-acting in some scenes, but overall, he makes Lefty a likeable mobster that we even come to pity and root for.  Pacino just seems to much more believable as Lefty than godfather in \\"Godfather 3.\\"  Depp's performance as the undercover agent is also strong, but lacks some depth.<br /><br />BTW, whether you liked this film or not, you should definitely read the book, \\"Donnie Brasco,\\" written by the FBI agent.  The film is actually very different from the book.  I won't give anything away, since both the film and book are totally worthwhile.
B000000XB9|4.0|This is the only Creedence album that most people own, which means it's what the band is most associated with.  That's really a shame because even though there's amazing music on this record, it isn't really definitive.  Creedence Clearwater Revival was one of the most remarkably consistent singles bands of any era, so it makes sense that Chronicle focuses just on the singles, but a better compilation would include such essential album tracks as \\"Wrote A Song For Everyone,\\"  \\"Tombstone Shadow,\\"  \\"Don't Look Now,\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"Born On The Bayou\\" which is arguably the band's defining moment.  I would have taken any of these songs over the 11-minute version of \\"Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" (the shortened single version would have made much more sense) or the throwaways from \\"Mardi Gras\\" that close Chronicle.  Still, it's hard to argue with any record that collects such classics as \\"Proud Mary,\\" \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\"  \\"Down On The Corner,\\" and \\"Looking Out My Backdoor\\" all on one disc.  If you're new to Creedence, I'd start here and then check out their individual albums. Really, you can't go wrong with this band (so long as you don't buy Mardi Gras...)
1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby captures an age & an era in \\"High Fidelity.\\" Even though it's set in England, all people of a certain age group will identify with the characters in this book. It's funny, smart, moving & its ending is right on target. Skip the inferior movie version and go staright to the source.
B000002UAX|5.0|There's no denying that there's a good deal of filler on this double album, much more than on other artists' double albums released around this time (The Jimi Hendrix Experience's masterful \\"Electric Ladyland\\" comes immediately to mind)but you have to admire the Beatles ambition here.  Unlike most people, I think Sgt. Peppers and The Magical Mystery Tour were strictly O.K. and that The Beatles didn't really hit their stride with the whole experimental thing until this album.  And some of the things they come up with here are truly remarkable.  John Lennon turns in the best stuff here with the gorgeous \\"Dear Prudence,\\"  the emotionally scorching \\"Julia\\" (a tribute to his dead mother that opens with the brilliant line, \\"Half of what i say is meaningless, but I say it just to reach you\\"), the rocking blues parody \\"Yer Blues,\\" and the hilarious \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun.\\"  Hearing Lennon sing \\"When I hold you in my arms and feel my finger on your trigger...\\" over happily innocent doo wop background vocals is absolutely classic.  Paul McCartney is responsible for much of the album's filler, but also does right with the monstrous \\"Helter Skelter,\\"  the fun country number \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and the very funny Chuck Berry/Beach Boys pastiche \\"Back In The USSR\\" (best line: \\"Come and keep your comrade warm).  George Harrison forshadows the brilliance he would display on \\"Abbey Road\\" and his own first solo album on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and the underrated \\"Savoy Truffle.\\"  Other good lesser-known tracks on this album are \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and \\"I'm So Tired.\\"  If you're willing to work through the sprawl, there's plenty more great moments on this daunting, brilliant double album.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I bought this movie on DVD the day it came out. Since I couldn't have  the chance to see it in the only dank, dark little movie theatre that it was playing at in my city. I was actually kind of dissapointed that it was not shown in widescreen format.Anyway, this movie has it all...egos are bruised, power and control are lost, much extravagant crap is bought. It was interesting to me at least to see Metallica vulnerable. To also have an insight in to the making of a record. Dubbed to be their most \\"controversial album\\". No , I didn't stutter. St. Anger was controversial in a sense that it created a ripple in their fanbase if to see if truly their fans were willing to take a journey with them in to the unknown. While many of their root fans have cried \\"sellout!\\" and jumped ship 12, 13 years ago. Well some claim to...after all somebody bought millions of copies of Load. Metallica has continued to bounce back and forth throughout the entire picture. St. Anger also saw them gain a wider audience. Mostly kids, sans teenagers. Hey, we were all teens buying Metallica records and going to the riot-barracaded shows back in the day. But back when they were  playing dinky little club shows, it was mostly teenagers and college students rocking out in the audience. The movie is really actually very good if your not a Metallica fan and very excellent if you are. Aside from the widescreen problem, there was really no big band infighting. Except from a day in the studio, where James is in a crappy mood and bashes Lars' drumming. Lars in turn starts talking when then leads to a little arguing, nothing big. I would of thought we at least see some chair throwing, screaming fist fights, but no avail. What's the deal with James drinking? It wasn't out of control. He wasn't yelling at his kids or beating his wife. What's the big deal? I do wish to see more of Jason Mewsted and more of Rob Trujillo. But that of course is waht the second disc is for. On disc 2, there many hilarious and justplain hilarious additional scenes. One of my favorites is when the guys are in the studio, and Bob Rock crunches Lars' toe with his chair and Lars' flipes out. Haha too funny.
B00004XONN|4.0|Radiohead's albums are all so controversial and dense that it's very hard to write an intelligent review.  Instead of rambling endlessly about hidden meanings behind the lyrics or how anybody who didn't notice a certain synth part in a certain song is a moron who doesn't understand music at all, I'm going to try to go song by song and given my honest opinion about each track.   <br /> <br />\\"Everything In It's Right Place\\" - 5/5 - Really great mood setting opener.  Kinda has a jazzy feel to it.   It's also very cinematic sounding, which is probably why it was used in Vanilla Sky.   <br /> <br />\\"Kid A\\" - 4/5 - This one takes a few listens before it sinks it, but it's really a quite beautiful song, especially towards the end.  Reminds me of early Aphex Twin, though somehow even more inaccessible.    <br /> <br />\\"The National Anthem\\" - 5/5 - Straight up, this song is amazing.  Building on a simple but brutal bassline, the band adds great-sounding horns and lots of nice synth touches.  One of my favorites.  <br /> <br />\\"How To Disapear Completely\\" - 3/5 - A lot of people really like this song but despite its great title, it doesn't really do anything for me.  I think maybe it's too inaccessible just for the sake of being inaccessible, if that makes any sense <br /> <br />\\"Tree Fingers\\" - 2/5 - A rather shapeless, go-nowhere instrumental.  Along with the previous track, this marks a real low point for the album <br /> <br />\\"Optimistic\\" - 5/5 - Radiohead gets back on track here with the album's most \\"normal\\" sounding song.  The lyrics are great and the jazz-funk bit during the fade out is especially cool.  I wish it went on longer.... <br /> <br />\\"In Limbo\\" - 3.5/5 - A good song but doesn't really live up to the better tracks on here.  I rarely skip it but i never put it on my custom playlists.   <br /> <br />\\"Idioteque\\" - 5/5 - Awesome track.  kind of a dance feel, but very sophisticated.  the lyrics are cool and Thom Yorke sounds truly desperate in his delivery.  This one sounds even better live, too.   <br /> <br />\\"Morning Bell\\" - 4/5 - Another standout.  Beneath all the electronic flourishes, theres a great plaintive melody and once again, nice lyrics and singing from Thom Yorke.   <br /> <br />\\"Motion Picture Sountrack\\" - 4/5 - Radiohead fanatics have told me that this song is supposed to be like the music you hear as you go up to heaven.  I don't know if that's true, but I can see why people would say that.  It really is beautiful, especially the part after the fake ending.  Oops....I gave away one of the album's best secrets...oh well, there's plenty more tucked away here.  My reccomendation is that you buy it and see for yourself.  You might love it, you might hate it, but I promise it will leave a distinct impression on you.
0671027344|4.0|In my opinion the book is interesting. It shows the procedure of growing up in the teenager's age including the problems with drugs, alcohol and love as many teenagers have. <br />There are many stories like this you can read about and also watch, but I think in this book you can really identify with Charlie, especially if you are in his age. <br />If you do not know many of these growing up stories, it would be interesting it read that book, but if you already know many, it will bore you. <br />For me personally it was interesting but it did not help me anyway <br />
B000005JA8|5.0|Okay, this album isn't 100% consistent.  The a cappela tracks in particular drag it down.  But i couldn't live with myself if i gave it less than 5 stars?  Why? Becuase simply put, this is the most creative album I've ever heard.  Beefheart takes Howling Wolf, Sun Ra, and Bob Dylan and twists them into one brilliantly weird, wonderful sound that is impossible to recreate.  Through it all, Beefheart's amazing voice and inspiring wordplay keep things utterly listenable (except on some of the afforementioned a cappela songs which simply go on for too long).  This album definatlely requires mulitiple listens but it is ultimately rewarding.  You'll find new jokes, new musical layers, and new meanings with each go round.  It is a shame that Beefheart is remembered mostly as an even stranger cousin to Frank Zappa because Beefheart has not only his own style and sense of humor but is also a much better songwriter and composer than Zappa ever was.  Zappa might have added classical, jazz, and avant garde elements to rock music, but The Captain invented an entirely new musical vocabulary that has influenced everyone from The Birthday Party, Richard Hell, Pere Ubu, and Tom Waits to newer artists like Devendra Banhart and The Fiery Furnaces.  \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" is truly a record for the ages.   <br /> <br />P.S. Also be sure to pick up \\"Safe As Milk\\", \\"Doc At The Radar Station\\", \\"Clear Spot\\", and if you can find it, \\"Lick My Decals Off, Baby,\\"  but please, start with \\"Trout Mask Replica.\\"
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Where to begin with this film?  Universal, well known as THE horror studio of the 30's and 40's made some amazing films; classics like Dracula, Frankenstein and The Werewolf. <br /> <br />Fast forward to 2004.  This movie is, quite simply, a piece of drek.  It is not even clever enough to rate as a lighthearted homage to those earlier works.  It is not worth the polyethylene terephthalate it was filmed on. <br /> <br />We have Abraham Van Helsing's younger sister's cousin's boy, a steam punk super secret James Bond-like Q bunker under the Vatican (!?) accessed by a special confessional, David Wenham of Lord of the Rings fame wondering if this is his future, playing buffoonish side kicks in bad scifi/fantasy flicks, and some really cheesy CGI work.  Considering the amount of money they spent on Kate Beckinsale's corset collection they could have kicked in a few bucks for better F/X. <br /> <br />The plot, such as it is, is an unlovely jumble of the three Universal classics mentioned above with a dash of Dr. Jekyll (as someone on LiveJournal put it, escaped from the League of Extraordinay Gentlemen) and James Bond.  Dracula wants Frankenstein (rather than Dr. Frankenstein) to animate vampire babies.  Nevermind the fact that a) vampires are generally considered, by legend, to be dead and unable to procreate b) and humans, even lightly dead ones, do not incubate their young in pupae.  But apparently vampires do.  And there's something to do with Kate Beckinsale's family being the last of the gypsies but their connection to the Dracula/Frankenstein/vampire pupae thing is tenuous at best, unless it's simply geographical distance.  Van Helsing is dispatched by the Vatican to stop Dracula's evil plot.  Or he's dispatched to Kate Beckinsale because... I'm not sure.  I think I was still boggled by the super secret lab. <br /> <br />To paraphrase the immortal words of Bill Macy in My Favorite Year, there's a lot of leaping and jumping but not so much drinking and humping.  There is much running about and CGI brides of Dracula and CGI werewolves and eye-rolling deus ex machina smacking you in the face and it really is never clear what any of them are doing or why they're doing it.  It's messy, uneven and laughable in moments where they're not making a pathetic effort at jokes. <br /> <br />In all seriousness this movie exists merely to show off Kate Beckinsale with tight leather pants, a brooding but anemic-looking Hugh Jackman and mediocre CGI work, the premise seeming to be that the movie-going public likes fast things, explosions, leather-clad, sword-wielding chicks and much rope swinging and we'll pay good money to see it, no matter how execrable the plot. <br /> <br />Buy one of the classics, instead, and savor the black and white sinister goodness of old fashioned filmmaking where plot actually mattered.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|This album is absolutely perfect.  Every song is great in every way; the songwriting, musicianship and attitude are all just right and compliment each other perfectly.  Elvis Costello may be dignified and old now, but anybody who's heard this album knows just how punk he was back in the day.  Just listen to the lyrics on \\"Lipstick Vogue\\" or \\"No Action\\"...you don't wanna mess with this guy.  Also, he's the only person who has EVER looked good in those glasses.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|FORGET ALL THE REVIEWS YOU HAVE READ !! MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT ON THIS ONE! First this is not a movie that is supposed to be like \\"The Grudge\\" or \\"The Ring\\" . This movie is not supposed to be a horror movie instead it is VERY SHOCKING AND DISTURBING. But that's exactly the filmmakers planned to do. I am not going to say anything about the story because then I will ruin the plot. All I can say is that I have now another favorite film director. James Wan who seems to be a very young and fresh director brings amazing twists to this movie. All I can say is I can hardly wait till I see his next master piece. I was completely surprised by the movie. From the beginning till the bitter surprising ending. The entire movie is done in a awesome camera work and cutscenes. It is loaded with fresh and shocking ideas. If you cannot handle blood in the fim you should not watch this movie at all.
0884271153|4.0|Sure the dialogue is forced and, as with all of Goldratt's books, the information presented is not new.  The gift is placing business principles in a context of a story with enough examples that one can extrapolate simple, logical and, powerful practices from it.  <br /> <br />I find that Goldratt novels provide simple frameworks that can be easily adapted and provide guidance to business thinking and process.  For instance, from The Goal I constantly use and teach the three money measures for helping people understand the true impact of a proposed change in their business processes or automation. <br /> <br />It's Not Luck is a great springboard for considering root cause analysis, program management for organizational change, sales tactics developed from customer needs, and generally good business thought processes for leadership.   <br /> <br />When you consider how many managers and executives have made it into the business world with out the MBA, this is great starter information that can have the \\"formal\\" business labels attached to it later.  Additionally, when you consider how many people went through B school but do not remember to apply what they learned, this is a simple reminder and a tutor for implementation. <br /> <br />I highly recommend any of the TOC novels these reasons.   <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|To me, Green Day represents a genre that mostly consist of balancing power cords on top of each other, together with a couple of enthusiastic drum solos and explicit lyrics. I didn't realize that this formula could create anything good... my bad! <br />American idiot is an album where everything just seems to be where it wants to be. The rhythm, the lyrics, everything fits! As a whole, the record is as solid as rock, bordering on rock-opera at times. Excellent!! <br />The album can however feel a bit too conventional at times. It wouldn't have hurt anybody if Green Day would've dared to cross a few more borders that's all.

B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop was one of the finest albums ever recorded. Also, Pop was the most innovative U2 album ever. The whole album is just amazing. We love THIS U2, I mean, the avant garde one, not this sellout iPod band they have become.  <br /> <br />U2 showed life, musically, in a beautiful and profound way and for that I love and thank them. Pop hit me immediatley. U2 used to write music with eloquence. Now those days are gone, sad but true.  <br /> <br />Pop was their most textured, enigmatic and dark album ever, and I just love it. The use of electronic sound samples has been so underrated, but the truth is every single sound used on this album works perfectly well here. Evocative lyrics, creative music, unheared songs, unconventional art, etc. Simply genious. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004R99F|5.0|this movie was one of the greatest because it reminds me of when mike was still a loser and rossler was still with the good guys and he was a resident evil freak. he used to be like girls are nasty and icky but then he transformed into a beast like in beauty and the beast for not surviving himself i dont understand what is going on in this world everyone is turning evil and bad i really dont understand its like armageddon am i right and it was when i had my chance to make it big as a successor and a world's inspired preacher but it was not meant to be as i am just a mear teacher just like KRS ONE it reminds me of when i was a young lad around 9 or 11 years old and mike used to love this movie and was watching it all the time and mike said i know 2+2 and he said i know how to spell OFF. it is O-F-F. but now hes disgracing the teacher who is me and is spiting at the one who created him. and he used to like cybiko and all that and he liked amanda bynes and was watching her every morning on channel 6 on nickelodeon and he liked ren and stimpy but now he is a monster and is infected with the G Virus which is bad
B00028HBKM|5.0|Watch the movie and submit to christ that`s the meaning of life lost souls worship the REAL GOD NOT POSERS.
B000001EAQ|5.0|It's simply one of the most perfectly realized albums of all time. I know is more fashionable to like ATYCLB, but this album is unstoppable. Pop is a cornerstone of any serious rock collection.  <br /> <br />Pop is U2 at their most expressive experimentation. This often-overlooked gem is especially enjoyable because these songs aren't played constantly on classic rock radio stations.  <br />
1592400876|4.0|Well, I'll be the first to admit that I could care less about punctuation.  If the author ever read this review, she'd probably have multiple heart attacks because of my use of punctuation.  In other words, I don't care.  So, why did this book entertain me?  Well, because, I never knew that punctuation was really that important.    Though some of the humor is not that humurous, Truss gives us a unique, eye-opening, and amusing view of someone who is a hardcore punctuation stickler.  She fully admits her obsessiveness and presents her point of view in an interesting way.  She points out common errors in the present day, in her own life, and in history.  For a subject this dry, she more than makes up for it with her fluid writing style.    Not only does she explain common problems, she also gives rules and usages for all types of punctation.  It is very interesting and informative.  However, much of it was simplified, so it can't really be used as reference book.    All in all, everyone should read it.  No, it didn't change my life, but it does make me pause and consider the proper use of punctuation.  It does lift away the fog of mystery that surrounds colons, semi-colons, parantheses, etc.  If a book makes you look at reading the written word a little differently, then it's done it's job.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've seen this movie 4 times and I just love it!  I can't wait for the dvd!  The music is so beautiful and the actress who plays Christine(Emmy Rossum) has such a beautiful voice for being only 17 years old! What a talent! The sets were so awesome you felt as if you were there! Phantom is such a wonderful love story and a wonderful lesson in not judging people for what's on the outside but seeing them for what's in the inside. <br /> <br />FIVE STARS! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007TKNIS|5.0|This movie is superb! I really loved the stage musical but this is ten times better...no, a hundred times better. I even had people who said they disliked the stage version comment on how great this film is. I don't understand why the critics are so harsh when the viewers are enjoying it. I should know, I've seen it nine times already...and I'm not the only one.  <br /> <br />There are some prominent changes from the stage version, but if you've never seen the stage version this movie is just as enjoyable. Gerard Butler did a phenomenal job. I myself was a little leary of him, knowing he's no Michael Crawford, but now I like him a lot better than Michael Crawford. He makes the Phantom more emotional, powerful, and more easier to sympathize with. Gerard definately deserved an Oscar nod for his role, but that's neither here nor there.  <br /> <br />I won't give away any of the surprises of the film, but I will tell you something...you won't be disappointed. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get mad, you'll feel sad, you'll want to jump for joy, then you'll want to throw things...it's a very emotional piece and not just for women (believe it or not, more men have cried in the theater than women).  <br /> <br />This is a must buy! You may even want two copies because you will wear out one of them for sure. <br />
0312330529|5.0|This is one of the most lyric and romantic books that I have read in a long time. It will make you pay attention to the faceless immigrant who hands you your change at the local quickie mart, it will explain the evils of controlled monetary exchanges to you. It will force you to question the validity of prisons as a means of curing social ills when they create an evil of unsupervised bestial power in the people who run them.  It gave me much more insight into the Russian-Afghan war. It sent me to my first Bollywood movie, and it reminded me that romance is real and exists in every day life.   <br />   But don't let my use of the word romance deter male readers, or readers of both sexes who prefer substance and mindful consideration of the world in their reading.  This is no bodice ripper mind candy hackwork.  It is a gripping story of a man who lost his way in the world and of his journey. The story is well thought out, with knowledgable inclusion of the nuts and bolts of streetlife and the seamy world that coexists intertwined with 'legitimate' society.      <br />     The book was gripping, lush, and compelling.  I dreamed of wild dog packs and slums and joyous people who appreciate the vivid beauty of the world around them.  The concordant beauty of the prose in this book demanded that I appreciate life.  This book will infuse your life with an appreciation of the rich fullness of humanity.  Reading it could spoil you - - the next few books you read could have leaden prose compaired to the lyric vision of this book.  Reading it could enrich your life and demand that you SEE and FEEL the vibrant world around you, and that you PAY ATTENTION to the subcontinent of India.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Nickelback has always written thought provoking music. Is it because the sheer emotional power of their music sends the human mind into a realm of mind expanding thought? Don't be rediculous. More appropriately, their music forces one to ponder questions like \\"How many gallons of antifreeze would I have to swallow to make myself stupid enough to enjoy a Nickelback album?\\" In fact, the lyrics alone will have you asking yourself which is more painful: enduring Chad Kroeger's lyrics, or running your crotch along the top of a chain link fence? <br /> <br />Although the guitar riffs on this album could be duplicated by a drunk chimp with two broken hands, the lyrics are far more difficult to endure. Apparently imagery, poetry, and metaphore are three chapters missing in Chad Kroeger's lyric writing handbook, titled \\"How to rape the human ear drum.\\" The lyrics are so blatenly literal and thoughtless that they could only be rivaled by stereo instructions set to music. <br /> <br />The most cherished moments of this album are probably the brief periods of silence that occur when the cd player is switching to the next track. The first song alone will make you contemplate pressing your face onto a skillet in an effort to distract yourself from the pain of listening.  <br /> <br />Honestly, I don't even know why radio stations play this filth, most DJs probably die a little inside everytime they're asked to play it on the air. Personally, if I were a DJ, I'd use caller ID to track down everyone who requests this trash and then beat them with reeds. In fact, our local DJ played the first song of the album, \\"Never Again\\", and then said on the air \\"you know, I know this song is supposed to be serious, but everytime I hear it I just have to laugh.\\" I would struggle to disagree.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 has more money than God but still insists on shilling for Apple's iPod (which is just useless anyway, but that's a whole other story). But I'm sure Bono has his own little way of justifying his actions to himself. I bet you he can even justify their hated website [...] <br /> <br />This album is simply disastrous. Are you listening to a different album? I sat through the whole of this CD and at the end I made a vow to spend the rest of my days tracking down Bono and his chums and break their kneecaps in recompense for the musical effluent they have inflicted on us poor innocent record buyers.  <br /> <br />What a waste of time listening to this album is. they have absolutely nothing to say, and they haven't had anything to say for at least 5 years. Though the CD has already sold 5-6 millions of copies and has been lauded by critics, it was among the common listener that we found much controversy. WHY? That's because this rubbish is their worst album ever. No other U2 album has found those mixed feelings within days of its release. Those ones whom think albums like 'Rattle & Hum' got the same controversy are wrong. 'Rattle & Hum' became a so-so album by the end of Lovetown Tour. Most of U2 fans are bored and tired of this soup. I can't believe they are to tour this dull product. But the album itself is irrelevant for every one. U2 IS THE EVENT, not the album. <br /> <br />So yeah, this album probably will go on to make U2 and their corporate backers way richer even than they already were. Good for them, I guess. As far as the actual album's concerned, it's far from being a good U2 item. Any other U2 album is better than this corporate effort. And this All That You Can't Leave Behind 2 reveal them in slivers of silly 'poetic' phrases, annoying melodrama and cliches. Edge's trademark guitar sound is filled with strained 'emotional' Bono's singing and filler rythm section. Songwriting is just imitation of their previous album. Shame on this sellout band. We really miss the real U2. <br /> <br />I`m with you guys. U2 1980-1997 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000K3D4|5.0|The one thing that teenage Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) hates the most is her baby brother Toby. One night, when Sarah is forced to babysit Toby against her will, she makes a wish that he would be taken by the Goblin king, where he would be forced to live as a goblin. She didn't mean it, of course. But her wish has been granted. Jareth (David Bowie), the King of the Goblins, has kidnapped Toby and taken him to his castle. If Sarah ever wants him back, she'll have to get to the center of a gigantic labyrinth where anything is possible and nothing is as it seems.    LABYRINTH is truly a wonderful fantasy movie that will bring out the inner spirit in any adult. It's got everything a fantasy needs. Fairy tale creatures, tons of humor, and definitely tons and tons of magic. One of the things that make this a-better-than average fantasy is the people who work on it. David Bowie supplies tons of great songs for this movie that any fan will want to hear. Also, Jim Henson takes a break from the Muppets and provides some interesting looking puppets for this film.    A great thing that LABYRINTH has going for it is its suspense. Right as Sarah enters the labyrinth, you'll be on your toes, hoping she'll make it out alive. Of course, there are plenty of times when Sarah could've certainly ended up dead, but it's a fantasy. Along with suspense is romance. David Bowie plays a character deeply in love. Forget the fact that he's probably over a few centuries old, and she's only a teenager. This is definitely a must-see for any fantasy fan who hasn't seen it yet.
B000005JA8|1.0|I feel ripped off like I did with the Beyonce album.  thought that this albumn isn't very good.you'd be better off not buying.he has a too high pitched voice that will drive you insane after a while.<br />THIS ALBUMIS GARBAGE<br />I DIDNT LIKE IT ONE BITE<br />I THOUGHT IT HORRIBLE<br />I Can't Understand How People Can Listen To This [...]. He Can't Rap And His Beats Stink. If You Want To Hear Some Good Rapping And Beats Get Any Of The Lil Jon And The EastSide Boys Cd's There are many many more artists who actually work harder and sing better then artists such as Captain Beefheart and get nothing. He basically uses his looks to sell records.<br />Why has this album taken the world by storm? It's nothing but safe hip-hop that doesn't address any issues or offer any depth. I'm not saying that every song has to mean something, but come on, this is just shallow and stupid.There are tons of things that an artist like Beefheart could put out there. How about a song that encourages young people to vote and take an interest in the world around them? How about a song about how life is still difficult for a successful white male artist?<br /><br />WOMEN fall for Beefhearts tricks, but anyone with eyes and ears should know that Beefheart is faking it!  can't believe people like this crap. Beefheart is the most annoying, money hungry [...] of the century. All of his songs sound almost identical, and his voice is so whinny and irritating. I would never waste my precious dollars on his memoriobilia, or his albums for that matter. Beefheart, someday you will be forgotten just like those other losers before you, so enjoy what you have now because it can only last so long.<br />what has the music industry wroght on themselves???? They only have themselves to blame....way too much R & B, Hip Hop crap on the airwaves...way too much. I await its fade into the sunset like the Diso era, Folk era, and Techno pop era. I await the return of great lyrics by master song writers, songs that use good grammer,poetry, and proper English! The more The Powers That Be annoit as \\"genious\\" midiocre talent, the more I stay away from CD purchasing and radio listening.<br />this guy for some reason which i cant understand<br />is a influence on the younger generation<br />as far as music goes...feeling,lyrics,sound<br />are to words which are too deep for him.<br />he his not in tune with just the basics<br /><br />very very bad album<br /><br />This album is just horrendous.If i had 2 choose listening 2 this album again or taking a shot of acid,id take the shot of acid.This album would make a midget wanna commit suicide,...absolutely horrible. Overall, if you likeBeefheat, you should either be below the age of 12 or you just don't know anything about music. If you want proper avant garde music look at Gary Barlow, or Gary Glitter<br /><br />You are not Gary Barlow and you never will be. I hate Beefhearrt as well, and I wish he would stop polluting the charts with his tuneless crap. His singing sucks, the beats are overused and annoying. Just to emphasize once again Beefheart you are jealous of all the attention Gary Balow gets. You are not as hot as he is, Captain Beefheart cant write songs,cant sing, cant dance etc. He cant do ANYTHING! untalented wannabe<br />Bad songs, bad album. Don't waste your time and money on this.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie is superb! I really loved the stage musical but this is ten times better...no, a hundred times better. I even had people who said they disliked the stage version comment on how great this film is. I don't understand why the critics are so harsh when the viewers are enjoying it. I should know, I've seen it nine times already...and I'm not the only one.  <br /> <br />There are some prominent changes from the stage version, but if you've never seen the stage version this movie is just as enjoyable. Gerard Butler did a phenomenal job. I myself was a little leary of him, knowing he's no Michael Crawford, but now I like him a lot better than Michael Crawford. He makes the Phantom more emotional, powerful, and more easier to sympathize with. Gerard definately deserved an Oscar nod for his role, but that's neither here nor there.  <br /> <br />I won't give away any of the surprises of the film, but I will tell you something...you won't be disappointed. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get mad, you'll feel sad, you'll want to jump for joy, then you'll want to throw things...it's a very emotional piece and not just for women (believe it or not, more men have cried in the theater than women).  <br /> <br />This is a must buy! You may even want two copies because you will wear out one of them for sure. <br />
6304609825|5.0|For any fans of walt Disney, Sleeping Beauty remains to be one of the \\"Must See\\" Disney Classics of the Golden age. <br />The story as we all know, is of the beautiful Princess Aurora, cursed at birth by the wicked Faery Maleficent to prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. In an attempt to shield her from this curse, the three comedy fairies take the child into their care and nature her into adulthood. <br /> <br />Whether you're a Disney lover or not, Sleeping Beauty's mixture of strong visual characters, exciting villains and breathtaking action allow us to once again get swept away with the childhood fantasy that sadly is lacking in so many of today's more modern animated features. <br /> <br />Make Sleeping beauty part of your collection before it disappears into the Disney valuts for another 7 long years!!!!
0394800184|5.0|This story is amazing and much more complex than the hobbit. Compared to the hobbit, it is an adult novel that ties in a story of perplexion, and a psychological journey.  The little goes on a quest for a deeper self-understanding.  The hobbit is a rip off of this book.  (Dorothy Matthews is stupid)
B00030590I|3.0|Set in what we know today as China but about 2000 years ago Hero is told in several sections and gets kind of confusing at times. Apparently the king of Qin, one of six sections of the future China, has been troubled for years by three assassins. One day a nameless man (Jet Li) comes in and tells the tale of how he has defeated the King's enemies. The king listens and then tells him that wasn't the way it was , it was this way and proceeds to tell the story a different way (in his version apparently only one of the killers is apparently dead and Li is working with the other two). Both versions use flashbacks and a lot of detail & locations as well as a predominating color in each story's segments. <br />It was very interesting to look at, I loved a lot of the details but found the use of color distracting. <br />I don't remember how I might've rated Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I think I liked it better overall. Ziyi Zhang ws in both movies, I'd like to see more of her work.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Yes yes yes. It's cacophonous, it's gritty, it's unpleasant. Put it on at a party and watch people make a mad dash for the door. Just try and dance to some of the arhythmic beats that fill the album like a car being thrown down a large flight of stairs. It's not popular music was never meant to be and will never apologize for not being so. It is as about an acquired taste as you can get. <br /> <br />Nonetheless, I truly think this will be one of the albums that survives the twentieth-first century. I think people will still be listening to this in a few hundred years when the concept of music changes and dissonance and staggering rhythms are as harmonious as the choir in the fifth plane of heaven. Rock has produced nothing like this up to this point. Nothing with this sense of exploration and personal vision. Nothing as playful, nothing as fun. Nothing that stretches the boundaries of what people think of as 'rock music.'  <br /> <br />I don't think 21st century music listeners in America are ready for this. To truly appreciate this album for what it is you need to have a different definition of music and rhythm from the norm. No words will prepare you for how jarring it is. Your friends will hate you, people will think you're insane or on drugs. My 98 year old mother still won't allow me to play it when she's home.  <br />Well, the musings here are quite \\"out-there.\\" Yes, cliche term, but, that about describes the album in the most emphatic sense of the term. It's a crazed mix of blues, R&B, garage-rock, abstract (free/avant-garde?) jazz, and modern composition, and it's all topped off by a vocalist who sounds as goofy and obnoxious as a demented cartoon character. <br />So, in the end, it's probably fair to say that both sides of the camp have a certain amount of validity in their responses: on the one hand, there is quite the amount of brilliant and ingenious techniques to be found here, and musicians who know their fair share about music theory and compositionwill find quite a bit to chew on. Barring technical details, listeners who get their kicks from things that are on the bizarre, experimental side, will have quite the opportunity to discover a goldmine. However, on the flipside, the album lacks any kind of typical or pleasant melody; melody is there, but it takes quite an effort on the listener's part to access it, especially if the listener is not used to intensely avant-garde musings. <br />Upon which it is clear that this album was made by a bunch of fake hippies, tootling on instruments they don't know how to play (or don't have the limbs to play, as with the two saxophones at once business), pretending to be ultra-crazy and avant-garde, and laughing all the way to the bank. An album for chumps who want to pretend that they're crazier than everyone else. Guess what, mates? You can keep it. Listen to this a million times if you want, it won't make you anything more than a buffoon with bad music playing on your stereo. <br />The core problem is that in my opinion, when you begin to grasp that Britany wasn't arriving at this incarnation of \\"music\\" via creativity, she was SPECIFICALLY AVOIDING traditional musical tonality. This means that it's entirely contrived, and not even close to an inspired piece of art. <br />.There IS melody, it can be found but it takes a determined set of ears and a love of abstract musical ideas and theory. In the Zone's drums are playing mostly conventional rhythms, though not always in 4/4. The whole album is quite spirited and uptempo, firmly in the Charlie Parker bop tradition (who was one of Ornette's most prominent influences) but abandoning the restrictions of that genre. There are some great moments on this recording--my favorite is the dual bass \\"conversation\\" between Madonna and Biritany. There are other pretty cool moments of interplay, and some great Coleman skronk too, but listening to all of this jam takes an open mind and plenty of patience. So, what we have here is a bold,unconventional, and influential recording...that does not compel me to listen with any sort of frequency. It's just not worth the effort, and believe me I have tried. <br />. Another reviewer termed this \\"for pseudo-intellectuals who need a life\\". I'd like to second that. Smarten up! You're no better than schmucks who like Christina Agueiliera. They like it because everyone else does; you hate it because everyone likes it. You like this album because no one else does. That doesn't make you any more original or intelligent than Christina Agueiliera fans! What a crew of sheep you are. Get a life. <br />A Message to Britany <br />I CAN SEE THROUGH YOUR FARCE!!!
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart charts the rise and fall of a tragic hero, Okonkwo, including the gradual disintegration of a traditional society, Umuofia, due to the influx of Christianity. In the beginning, Okonkwo appears marked for greatness. At a young age, he gained fame and brought honor to his village when he defeated Amazline, in a wrestling bout. In no time, he rises to become a prosperous farmer with barns full of yams, a well feared warrior with two traditional titles under his belt. His rags to riches saga is all the more remarkable because of his impoverished background. His father, Unoka, was a lazy man, an 'agbala' who did not hold a traditional title, but instead left a pile of debt at his death. Haunted by his father's shameful legacy in a war like society, Okonkwo strives excessively hard to distance himself from his father's failings by advocating hardwork and adopting a persona almost devoid of humanity.<br /><br />During the week of peace, he defies the customs of the land by beating up his youngest wife. At the New Yam Festival, he almost kills his second wife in a gun incident. But his fate is sealed when he kills his foster son, Ikemefuna. Ikemfuna was the sacrificial lamb handed to his village to atone for the murder of the wife of a fellow villager. Due to the enormous respect accorded Okonkwo, Ikemefuna was left under his care. Despite warnings from the oracle, \\"The boy calls you father, dont bear a hand in his death,\\" Okonkwo ignores the warning and instead kills Ikemefuna for fear that he might be considered weak in the group of his fellow villagers. With time, Okonkwo rises to become the greatest warrior in his clan. But his world crumbles when he inadvertently murders a fellow village. As punishment, he is banished for seven years to his motherland, Mbanta, where he leads a life of regrets.<br /><br />In his absence, the missionaries arrive at Umuofia and succeed in converting some of the inhabitants into their fold. By the time Okonkwo returns home, he realizes to his dismay that his dreams of receiving a heroic welcome has been overshadowed by the activities of the Christian missionaries in the village. High ranking men had joined ranks with Christians by renouncing their titles. The last straw occurs when his first son, Nwoye, joines the Christian religion. As he reflects on his sudden fall in the society, he is aghast that his chi had failed him. In the final run, he attempts to wipe out the forces of imperialism but is met with opposition from his fellow villagers. Devastated, Okonkwo chooses an undignified route that tarnishes his legacy.<br /><br />Things Fall Apart is a great African novel that succeeds in showcasing the rise, collision and fall of African tradition against Christianity. It's a great novel!
B000001EAQ|5.0|There are quite brilliant songs on this album, as 'Please', 'Mofo', 'Gone', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Wake Up Dead Man', 'If You Wear That Velvet Dress', etc.  <br /> <br />Pop is an underappreciated masterpiece, but it's just the most experimental, obscure and indescribable U2 album !. Just buy it for 'Please' alone, their most dramatic 90s song. This emotive statement is something you simply can't miss. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor, do not listen to that self-indulgent sellout Ipod band Grammy worthy, listen to this mindblowing album instead.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|If I was to tell you that this album, along with their previous release, Anoraknophobia, were completely financed through donations from fans, worldwide, who paid upfront for albums that had not even been recorded yet, you might think these guys were The Beatles or The Stones, but they can't even get played on the radio here in the States except for a few small markets.  It's a crying shame!  This album, Marbles, of which I own the 2CD set, only available from their website or through other fans selling their extra copies on ebay or amazon, is a masterpiece!  I thought they'd petered out with Radiation, which was a poor record following another poor effort This Strange Engine, but they've come back with a concept album, (which is only called that because of the 4 Marbles songs, but the rest of the songs are not inter-related), that blows me away EVERY TIME I HERE IT!  It's stuck in my player.  The music is fascinating, and the vocals are indescribable.  Steve Hogarth had a tough job ahead of him when he replaced Fish, but his influence on the band is unmistakable and completely original, not owing to anyone else.  His songs are richly detailed and melodic to say the least.  Steve Rothery's guitars are mind-bendingly awesome!  Pete Trewevas' bass is amazing!  He is turning out to be one of the premiere bassists in the world today.  (Check out his other band - Transatlantic which showcases Dream Theatre's drummer, Mike Portnoy; the Flower Kings' guitarist Roine Stolt; and Spock's Beard's keyboardist Neal Morse.)  If you are thinking of buying this cd, make sure to get the 2cd package, as it's worth every penny!  The songs that are not included in the single edition are what make this an excellent album.  You won't be sorry.  Just ask all of us who paid up front for the band to record it.
B000002VC5|5.0|A friend turned me on to this record in 1977. The day after I bought it I ran out and bought \\"Tales of Mystery and imagination\\" too. Science fiction and Fantasy seem to go hand in hand with bands of a Progresive nature. I soon discovered that Alan Parsons was a Recording engineer at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, and did some work on the Beatle's Final album \\"Abbey Road\\". While in no way does he sound anything like the Beatles, it is clear that those influences are at work here. I give Alan Parsons credit for making one of the best progressive rock LP's of all time. What is sad is that is later releases would be just so much FM Radio Pop Fluff. If you like this LP, I strongly suggest you check out Chris Squire's \\"Fish Out Of Water\\".

0425170349|4.0|Without Remorse left us with John Kelly turning into CIA legend John Clark. Unfortunatly for Rainbow six, that doesnt leave much for charator development. Besides the good guys it doesnt leave much for bad guys. Although they are anything but typical, think of them as hippies gone wild. Rainbow Six isnt a total let down though. On the contrary, it's anything but that. It's starts off hard and fast, and ends the same way. But you can't help but catch your eyelids falling as you read inbetween the action parts. It's fun to read, but none the less, can't match up to Without Remorse.
B0000019PA|5.0|Mr. (or Mrs.) C. Mackey, don't you get it? Sometimes (well almost always) music is a riddle and you just don't get the NMH riddle. This is supposed to be lo-fi, and the singer's voice is not supposed to reach those highs that he tries to reach. There lies the beauty. An album of poor songs by an inept artist trying to reach ridiculous highs with his/her voice will constitute and deserve a poor reception. But this my friend, is a great album by a ridiculously intelligent artist who knows his voice cannot smoothly hit the highs that you think he should in order to make this a great album. Technology doesn't make the artist great. If it does, then Korn should be right up your alley. Adding technology to this album would only damper its greatness. This is superb. Not for all people. True, Magnum's voice will send the impatient screaming on track 2, because unfortunately we have evolved into an American Idol worshipping, gratify me NOW society.  Christ this album is beautiful. If you don't appreciate this, stick with Top 40.
0767802470|5.0|Wolfgang Peterson's 'Das Boot' has deservedly received many accolades. This film is without equal - so far as the genre goes. It is thoroughly gripping to watch, absolutely brilliant acting, matched by superb directing. The film - for the most part confined to the insides of a beleagured German U-boot with its crew - is so realistic, it seems like a crime to stop for tea or visit the toilet. You can almost feel the dripping, dank, breathless atmosphere of the U-boat. The sense of despair written over faces, as rivets begin to pop and explode through excessive water pressure upon the creaking hull- drives home the cruel irony of the hunter - having turned into the hunted.       Claustrophobic, under-water dread, is relieved by surfacing - only to face other miseries. Perhaps the 'lightest' moment or sequence, is when the U-boat runs the gauntlet for La Spezia, under the very noses of the Royal Navy - part of it in a daring surface dash. Even when 'things are going well' (according to \\"orders\\") for a U-boat on active service, the captain and a few of the crew watch aghast, looking helplessly upon the short-lived 'survivors' of a torpedoed merchant ship as it goes down - in icy waters, surrounded by flames. Nothing in this film glorifies war. (The opening scenes show a pre-sorty party on land, with a drunken U-boat crew member lapsing into cynical comments about the Fuhrer). Jurgen Prochnow excells himself as the captain of this fated U-boat. He knows the irony of his situation. He knows the cruel consequences of his job - all round, but does his best to maintain the morale of his crew. Generally, U-boats have a bad image - sinking relatively helpless merchant ships is cruel and deep down, it goes against the grain of any man who takes to sea - including U-boat captains.     In many 'popular' post-war images, U-boat captains were depicted as monocled, thin lipped murderers, uttering an inhuman, metallic chuckle, as merchant ship falls victim to torpedo attack. The other side of the picture, is that - by the time radar and sonar came into full use with destroyer escorts protecting convoys, going on a U-boat mission was virtually a death sentence. Not a matter of 'if' you would be killed - but only of 'when.' Jurgen Prochnow plays a U-boat captain with daring - yes, but it is tempered by an underlying ambivalence. He sees that all parties involved - are victims. This feeling is shared by the entire U-boat crew. The tragic sense of life therefore supervenes. This is capped by the denoument of the whole story - when the U-boat is bombed on the way back into to its pen. Perhaps, more than any other single film, Das Boot captures the feeling tone of the post-war mind-set in Germany as regards the futility and horror of war. The haunting theme music added poignancy. This is film-art at its superlative best.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher is not the normal boy you read a book about. That is what makes him so interesting. I never read a book like The Incident before, maybe that is why I am enthusiastic, but I do not believe I would dislike it if I read one, because language and style are quite good and you can easily imagine how Christopher is thinking. A fine example is why he likes red cars in a row. <br />Sometimes the book might be a little bit boring. This is why I left reading one ore two parts, because they were too detailed, but that has not affected my understanding and I still enjoyed reading it. <br />I think it was not easy to Mark Haddon to write this book and I would never say it is the best I have ever read, even if I say I love it. Because of the theme it is a little bit difficult to talk about. I am neither an autistic person, nore a specialist in autism, nonetheless I think Haddon has not done a bad job and the describtion of Asperger's Syndrom is good.  <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|What's most frustrating is that many songs start out in the same trademark direction. It was worse than I expected. This stuff is easy. A 4 year wait for another mediocre U2 studio album. Almost unlistenable. I agree with most of fans here, HTDAAB is just an ATYCLB reissue with another name.  <br /> <br />U2 used to be cool, but they gradually have gotten less avant garde and more radio-friendly. This one is just terrible. I dare to say it's their worst effort ever. I can't stand this statement of mediocrity. U2 have become in that horrible mainstream music that you constantly pretend to love on your highschool, you know, among female friends and all that. <br /> <br />U2 say they are merely protecting the world, but it comes off as being very greedy. I am all for free market and capitalism, but how much money do these sellouts need?. They make majority of their money from touring, if they never made another album again, they would still collect huge amounts of money from royalites and touring.  <br /> <br />The most dissapointing thing about this U2 is the horrible glamorization of the band. U2 have become in glammy pop mainstream 'artists'. <br /> <br />Wake Up dead men !
B00005JKCH|3.0|the slow part is almost predicted, because they are just trying to introduce the main characters. Sam Raimi does a great job directing this, great camera shots. Willem Dafoe does a great job portraying the green goblin and norman osborn. Kirsten Dunst plays an alright Mary-Jane, for some reason, i wasn't too pleased with that casting call, Kirsten Dunst is a great actress, but this didn't seem like her type of role. Tobey Maguire, of course, who portrays a wonderful Peter Parker, but a shaky spider-man in the beginning, but he got better as the movie progressed. Cliff Robertson and Rosemarie Harris, who do so well as the Aunt and Uncle. Even though the Uncle Ben character is only in the movie, probably 20 minutes, you feel connected to the character. <br /> <br />Plot seemed shaky, but good. Some script cliches and the wrestling scene was not needed aswell. It is not the best movie, but it should make comic book fans jump for joy.

0440237688|4.0|Try to imagine a world without feelings, without color, without decisions. Welcome to the world of a 12 year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a futuristic community that has eliminated all of these things and much more. He can't love his own parents, listen to music, or even decide what he wants to do with his life; all these things are forbidden to him. He has never experienced any of these things until now, but how can he keep these beautiful and wonderful things to himself? How do you explain love or a beautiful sunset to someone who can't see color or express feelings? He decides that he can't go back now since he has experienced these things, he must do something to change the community forever.
B000002UAR|5.0|Rumor has it that the Beatles wrote and cut this album while under the heavy influence of LSD. Whether that is true or not, make your guess, but \\"Revolver\\" is regarded by many as the finest Beatles album in history, combining all the elements they had to the best mix ever.  <br /> <br />What does that mean? Not too pop, but not too psychedlic. Not too many rock songs, but not too many pop songs. Not too many serious songs, but not too many light hearted songs. Not too much experimentation, but not too much relying on old tricks. Excellent song writing from Lennon/McCartney, great contributions from Harrison/Starr, fabulous studio production by George Martin, and hell, excellent songs. <br /> <br />As said before, the spectrum is broad, and that is easy to see. Eleanor Rigby, a very melancholy song with a string quartet instead of drums or guitar, is phenemonal. Then there is \\"Got to get you into my life\\", a very light hearted song reminiscent of the \\"mop top\\" days, a complete opposite sound to Eleanor Rigby, but still a great song. Then you have \\"Here, There, Everywhere\\", a song in the vein of McCartney style pop (Light hearted, ballad) to Lennons \\"Dr. Robert\\" (sneering, political hard rock) to George Harrisons \\"Taxman\\" (witty, silly). A perfect mixture of all the elements for the greatest rock band of all time. <br /> <br />After this album, tensions took over. The sound got more complex, and division in the band was becoming a bigger issue. Though they released excellent albums after this one, this was the prime of the Beatles. With the possible exception of \\"Abbey Road\\", it never got as good as this, for the Beatles and for the music loving public.
0688163173|3.0|This was my first Lehane book and I must say I'm not impressed.  I found it a bit formulaic, recalling bad memories of Dallas.  I would think any avid mystery reader would have this story solved just by reading the back of the book.<br /><br />It wasn't a total waste of my time.  I liked the character development and found Teddy's love for his wife endearing.  However, it does have loose ends and the ending is left up for interpretation.
B000000H4A|5.0|Unlike most band's very 1st release (which usually have low production) this album DOES NOT!!! and it absolutely ROCKS!! from start to finish!!King Diamond's voice is excellent on this debut, and with the SAME line-up as on the Metal Masterpiece \\"Abigail\\" King Diamond absolutely ROCKS!! Andy La Rocque's guitar playing is AMAZING!!(but ALWAYS IS on ALL the King Diamond albums). There are ALOT of really GREAT songs on this album, Highlights include: \\"HALLOWEEN\\",\\"THE LAKE\\",and \\"CHARON\\" ( plus don't forget that Old Yule-time favorite: \\"NO PRESENTS FOR CHRISTMAS\\". The sound quality is absolutely AMAZING!(ALL the Re-Masters are though in the series). Fans of King Diamond,Mercyful Fate, or just really good Heavy Metal in general don't hesitate to pick this album up!!You WILL NOT be dissapointed!!Great Album!!! LONG LIVE THE KING!! and LONG LIVE METAL!!(PS): also be sure to check out King Diamond's other albums in the catalog (especially:\\"Abigail\\",\\"Them\\",and \\"Conspiracy\\"!!!!).
0553382179|4.0|I subscribe to Marla's FlyLady website and love her system; it has made a huge difference in my attitude toward household management and cleanliness.  I agree with many readers that the info in this book is repetitive of the materialon the website.  If you don't have regular access to a computer and prefer to have a hands-on manual, try the book.   <br /> <br />NOW, for those of you who DON'T like Marla's book or her FlyLady system, you are entitled to your opinion.  But shame on you for berating those of us who find it helpful!  One reviewer said that this book is only helpful to depressed people with low self-esteem, which I find insulting.  I am certainly NOT depressed, and I resent those generalizations.  However, I am a working mom (with a job outside the home) with a toddler and a husband who's in grad school, so housekeeping was low on my list of enjoyable things to do, and my house was a mess.  I preferred to spend my time in the evenings with my family, and I was so overwhelmed by the state my house was in that I couldn't bring myself to climb out of the hole we had dug for ourselves.  With the help of the FlyLady's suggestions and my helpful husband, we have made great strides in cleanliness and organization without sacrificing our family time. <br /> <br />I admit, I do not find every single one of Marla's suggestions helpful or relevant to me.  But overall, I have benefitted from her help, and so have many other people.  Her system is all about making routines that suit you and your family, which may mean adapting her instructions to suit your needs.  If you didn't like this book, please say so and explain why so that others will be able to decide if this book is for them.  But seriously, lay off the insults and be kind to others!  Honesty is necessary and appreciated, but your intolerance and rudeness is not.
B000002UAO|5.0|In December 1965, the Fab Four from Liverpool would come out with the album that changed everything. Before this album, the Beatles were a loveable bunch. Charming, mop top young boys with a sense of humor and silliness, they were loved by fans all over the world, ruled the radio airwaves, and were the hottest concert ticket in town. The boys made easy going, light hearted ditties about love and relationships. They didn't ever get too deep into issues. This all changed with the release of this album.  <br /> <br />Some theories are abound to why this album was the turning point, and how the Beatles diverted their attentions to a completely new sound. Some suggest that the drug habit that the boys learned from friend Bob Dylan was catching up with them, opening their mind to new ideas. Some consider that the boys had done all they could do with light hearted pop songs, and wanted to get into deeper topics and issues. Some also say that producer George Martin wanted to get into the new genre of psychedlic and folk rock, which was becoming the new genre of choice. These all probably contribute to it, but one thing is for sure: the album had a completely new and unique sound to it not heard in the work of their earlier albums. <br /> <br />The change of pace for some bands equal doom and disaster. Not so for this group. They adjusted with flying colors, creating the best and most complex music of their career. Songs like \\"Norweigen Wood\\" show them doing two new things: creating a whole new beat never heard of before, and using non-typical instruments for rock music. The use of a Sintar in this song, with it's deep, complex lyrics, and lucious, new flow sound nothing like \\"Love Me Do.\\" The typical love song this was not. \\"Nowhere Man\\" show the band divulging into deeper issues, telling people to get up and get on with life. The song was a lot more melancholy in sound compared to their older stuff. \\"Word\\" is about the booming drug culture growing in the U.S. Deeper topics, complex arrangements, new instruments, and the use of many technological advancements WAY ahead of their time created a lush, new sound.  <br /> <br />If this was the transition album for the Beatles, they passed with flying colors. The Beatles would continue to develop a new style of sound that was never heard of before on other albums. However, it all started here. The Beatles said good-bye to touring and hello to the studio, and the whole music world would thank them for that later.
B00068S41I|5.0|Excellent movie  - can be bought at WalMart - new DVD for $15.50 The price here is too high  no movie is worth that much
B0002MB7R6|4.0|If one did not watch this movie before hearing what is happening now around the world, he/she may be thinking that all that is occurring is coincidental - NOT THE CASE! <br /> <br />This movie will help to emphasize in your mind the advantage that we have been taking on what has been given to us.  There is a great level of accurracy on ALL implications in this movie. <br /> <br />Watch it and then listen to news - JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
B00063MBU8|1.0|Man, the guys at simple plan really know how to put out a great record! Do you know their secret to sucess? i bet i can guess! Is it singing like a baby terradactyl? or wait, is their secret that they love to shop at bath and body works. no one knows, but we do know this: the simple plan kids really need to eat some food because i think they are about to starve; or at least take some damn viteamons! Peace i'm out, Good charlotte and all american rejects for life!!! <br />
B000002UB3|5.0|1969 provided to be a bittersweet year for music. The good news is that a new rock band, Led Zepplin, was being talked about with much vigor and excitement. Also the newest album by the \\"Fab Four\\" was being talked about as well. However, this would be the last time the four would ever be together. Ever. The (arguably) greatest rock band in history would break up for good after this album. \\"Abbey Road\\" would be the swan song of the Beatles, and what a way to end a career. Many bands could release an album like this, retire, and join the legions of greats. The Beatles just added fire to the fuel that was already there and established more on why they were the greatest rock band in history. <br /> <br />The turmoil and differences in the band were getting to the boiling point. Brian Epstein, their long time manager and great friend, died. Rumor has it that Epstein struggled with coming out gay and also his contract with the band was coming to a close. Realizing that he might be out of a job, it was a hard time for him. At the same time, the four all had their own abitions. Lennon was becoming the political rocker, while McCartney was set on love ballads and pop. Harrison was exploring more into world music, and Ringo... well, he always had some silly ideas that worked out well. They were not on the same page. McCartney said it best: \\"Before, we were all friends coming together to make music and have fun. Now we were all musicians who came to do their job, go home, and go on with life.\\" Harrison even quit the band for four days due to the conflict that was forming between the four. It was a hard time for the band. <br /> <br />The album, named after the street in London where the band recorded it, is nothing short of pure perfection. In other words, your typical Beatles faire, which of course is ANYTHING but typical. The song writing duo of Lennon/McCartney make more songs that seem like they just pull it from a tree like an apple (ironically the name of the studio). \\"Come Together\\" was a hard rocking number with a lot of swager and style, and has become one of the most covered songs in history. Many hard rock artists say that song was what they style their music after, so it was very influential (besides becoming a number one hit). The other artists also made inputs into the music. George Harrisons guitar work and devotion to world sounding music came together to form the beautiful \\"Something\\". The guitar work in this song is divine, and it flows with smooth rhythm and beat. An amazing song, one of my all-time favorites (again, another song covered by numerous artists). Ringo contributed his silliness and love for the juvenile in \\"An Octupuses Garden\\". Though it might not have been one of their most remembered songs, it is still featured on many childrens albums remade by children artists such as Raffi and others. That's the influence this band had. From artists like Led Zepplin to Raffi. Very broad. <br /> <br />The sign of the end is stamped with the song \\"the end\\". With the words \\"You receive the love that you give\\", the greatest band there ever was (and possibly ever will be) was done. Oh yeah, to show they still had their silly and charming side, \\"Her Majesty\\" was placed as the last song, so as to not end on a sad note. <br /> <br />But it is. For seven short years (1962-1969), the men with mop heads, skinny ties, and bright smiles took over not only the music world, but the whole world. Evolving from bubblegum pop, straight ahead rock, and good times, the band turned into one of the most progressive and psychedelic experiments in history, using the power of the studio to maximum effect. The result of this history? One, the saving of rock and roll. Two, 27 number one hits. Three, well, ironically, three of possibly the best albums in history of music (Rubber Soul, Revolver, and this). Four, an influence that has remained in music to this day. Nothing, no one, no how, has even come close to matching the genius, skill, talent,and heart that this band had. The song writing genius and singing skills of Lennon/McCartney, the guitar work of Harrison, the drum work of Starr, the studio production of George Martin, and the managing of Brian Epstein. Put it all together, and you are given the ultimate formula for music success. If losing that doesn't make you sad, then you are truly not a music fan, because whether you love them or hate them, The Beatles influence is STILL present today. Heard of bands like Aerosmith, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and countless others? Influenced by the Beatles. The boy bands? Influenced (unfortunately) by the Beatles. Dave Matthews? Influenced by the Beatles. New bands like Rooney? Take a guess. Yes, this being the last album from the fab four created a sad situation in music for eternity, just like Michael Jordan did when he left basketball, and Ali when he left boxing. Their influence and legacy will always leave on, even if they have moved on to greener pastures. <br /> <br />\\"Abbey Road\\": One of their best albums, one of the best albums in history, and the end of the Beatles. They would go onto solo carrers and go on with life, some facing tragedy (Lennon), others disease (Harrison), and two more continuing on (McCartney/Starr). If you need more proof of their influence in present day, just ask yourself this question: Who was that performed at the Superbowl show in 2005 in his 60's? Pick up an essential piece of music history today.
B00005KHEU|4.0|For an album of material produced and written by one person, Jeff Lynne, Discovery by Electric Light Orchestra is very diverse.  The hits \\"Shine A Little Love\\" and \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" are the best known tracks from Discovery, but the rest of the album is filled with great tracks that will appeal to fans of late `70s pop and progressive rock.<br /><br />The discofied \\"Shine\\" and \\"Last Train to London\\" are easily the most dated releases from the album but are still solid songs.  The `60s-influenced pop of \\"Need Her Love,\\" \\"Midnight Blue,\\" and \\"Wishing\\" blend well with the uniquely ELO creations \\"The Diary of Horace Wimp\\" and \\"Confusion.\\"  Bringing Discovery to a close is the sublimely simple, but effective rocker \\"Down.\\"  All are performed with precision by bandmates Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan, Richard Tandy and Kelly Groucutt, along with ELO's legendary strings.<br /><br />Though it's not the definitive ELO album, Discovery is certainly no stinker.  Casual fans may want to start with a \\"best of\\" retrospective like \\"Essential Electric Light Orchestra\\" to get \\"Shine A Little Love\\" and \\"Don't Bring Me Down,\\" but ELO fans and curious audiophiles will be pleased with this album.<br /><br />This remastered version has some additonal tracks that I haven't listend to, because I have the original LP from 1979, but I have no doubt that they meet the same excellent standards that make \\"Discovery\\" a winner.  Buy it without hesitation.
B000021XS0|1.0|OK. This is the most overrated album in prog history (Yeah, more overrated than Close to the Edge).    Dream Theater used to be an amazing band but all their magic died when Jordan Rudess arrived. Rudess is a veteran sesion musician that will never write a song like \\"Space Dye Vest\\".  I agree that in terms of technique Rudess is a great player (I love the way he plays the piano) and he also has developed new stuff in the keyboard world, but he does not understand that playing 10 notes per second is not everything . I even prefer Derek Sherinian than Rudess...    It is hard to say this (and maybe hard to accept): Kevin Moore was the mastermind behind Dream Theater.  Since this album the guys have been focusig in pyrotchnics and in making fast solos.     Regarding the album: The concept is weak, the lyrics are bad and i dont like the music at all and the lack of melody and counterpoint (All the insturments playing the same riff) is remarkable. One star thanks to the \\"Overture 1928\\", the only decent track.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This album is without-a-doubt worth every dollar! Michael Buble has once again shown his remarkable talent and versatility and his ability to tug at the listener's heartstrings. Although his voice carries shades of singers such as Harry Connick, Jr. and Frank Sinatra, his voice resounds with a more rich, clear tone (and I mean NO disrespect to the aforementioned singers). The thing that I also like about Buble's following is that he has drawn in people of all ages which has allowed them to hear songs from different eras. Although I am only 25 and I admit that I still listen to a great dea of \\"top 40\\" music, I agree that music today lacks a richness, sweetness, and timelessness that makes many old songs very worthy of the title of \\"a classic.\\" I most definitely recommend that you sit back, open your heart, and lend your ears to this tremendous singer. I believe you will be drawn in to the lure of a singer who, by all accounts, shows no signs of fading away any time in the near or far future.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Every boxing movie fan should agree that the best boxing movie ever is Raging Bull. Forget Rocky. A third-rate actor named Sylvester Stallone acually got praised for it. Raging Bull is a finely made movie, with great performances including Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty-Gentile, and the incomperable Robert DeNiro. **** Ordinary People. The Academy people who voted that as Best Picture must've been smoking something when that decision was made. Martin Scorsese should get an Oscar for The Aviator. He should've gotten it for this one, but a broken down director named Robert Redford had to get it. But i'm glad that De Niro got it. Overall, a superb film!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I'm a PMG fan and didn't hesitate to purchase this album when it came out. I was impressed. It is one of their best. That being said, I attended the February 17, opening concert for the 2004/2005 Way Up World Tour - Buffalo, NY at the University of Buffalo Preforming Arts Center. PMG openned the act with the Way Up - the entire 68 minutes worth. Hearing it performed live simply blew me and everyone attending, away. It was nothing short of an incredible experience. As much as I  liked the CD I don't know if I can ever listen to it again and enjoy it as much. However, if you can't attend a PMG Way Up tour concert, the CD is not a bad 2nd best!
B0002Y4T92|5.0|On my 2 dvd set, I don't have Layla.  However I can get by going to disk 2, go down to \\"main\\" press the left directional button, then hit play. <br />Are there any more coded songs on these disks, I heard there was another with Beck and Clapton. <br />Does anyone know anymore of these codes?
0517118297|1.0|There's a new edition of Jane Austen's complete novels that's better value than this one, you might want to take a look at it - the ISBN number is:<br /><br />0954840119<br /><br />(put this into the Amazon search box and it'll come up).
B0002S947K|5.0|This is one of those discs I'm running the risk of loving to death.  I can't stop listening to it.  Every song has been a favorite at some point, starting with the heart-swelling \\"Hold You Forever,\\" a song that does justice to the best of the best romantic love, but also reminds me of my unbelieveable love for my young daughter.  Then there's the rockin' \\"How Come,\\" which has you tapping your feet to a tune about social injustices and the confusion about a lack of love in a world where we all want and need it.  Ray Lamontagne is amazing.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I saw them in concert and I was disapointed.  Still think the singer talks to much and does not keep any surprise in his show.  Honestly, that cd is wonderful. I would not venture to go in their previous albums as they are too heavy for me but this one is mellow. Favorite song: hope leaves. <br /> <br />
B000002UDG|3.0|This CD is good, but I would'nt call it- \\"All the Best\\".  For example, it is definitely worth it to buy a used verion for about 5 dollars if only for the few great songs on here, such as \\"Band on the Run\\", \\"Jet\\", \\"Ebony and Ivory\\", \\"Live and Let Die\\" and \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\".  Who needs \\"C-moon\\" or \\"Silly Love Songs\\"?  I would not recommend buying a new version, as it's not nearly worth $12.00.<br /><br />Another regret I had was that this album did not include \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\".  Thanks for reading.
B0002L592Q|5.0|When this movie came out in theaters, I was only 12 years old.  I don't even remember it being in the theaters.  Luckily I happned to watch it a few years ago.  Ever since I have never forgetten the way it makes me feel.  I get goosebumps whenever I hear the film score.  A tremendous tale of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity and the tough times life places before us.  The plot is flawless.
006072448X|5.0|School shootings were *the* topic of the 90s as teen after teen comitted homicide, killing classmates and teachers. A national debate raged: nature v. nurture? what was the role of parents? just how were these kids getting all these freakin guns anyway? whose fault was it? <br />These questions have fallen by the wayside since this country has become consumed with terrorism and war, but they are still relevent. Great minds have spoken about school shootings, but it is Shriver's book that speaks best about them. <br />This book will swallow you whole. It will take your idea of the \\"typical\\" school shooter and his family and turn it on its head. You will be shocked and you will be angry. <br />The narrator of the story is Eva, mom to school shooter Kevin. Her writing style--letters to her estranged husband, Franklin-works beautifully for this narration: it becomes clear that Franklin always stood behind and defended Kevin while Eva was nervous about his behavior, from infancy on through school and various suspicious incidents. Eva explains herself to Franklin, but she does so guiltily. <br />The book has a whopper of an ending. We know from the beginning that Kevin is in jail for the murders; eventually, in a heartbreaking and devestating play-by-play we learn how the murders were done, and later another shock, this one truly dreadful, awaits us. <br />I cried during this book, and the memory of it makes me cry still. It has stuck with me in a way that few books do. Too often to focus is on solely the victims and their families, and Shriver has shined a light into a world so dark that most would fear to go. This is a stunning potrayal and one that should be read. <br />Eva is not the only one who needs to talk about Kevin. <br />We all do.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|German thrash/speed metal legends Kreator have already kicked off 2005 with their new album Enemy Of God, and thus far, it's the best new album I've listened to this year. This album has it all, wonderfully written lyrics, ear piercing vocals, killer guitar riffs, shredding solos, thunderous double bass drum assaults, you name it. There's even a bonus video too, and it kicks ass. No pansy ass Linkin Park or A.F.I here, this is the real deal. My favorite songs are Enemy Of God, Impossible Brutality, Dystopia, Suicide Terrorist, World Anarchy, Murder Fantasies, heck the whole album is great. 2005 is definately going to be another great year for true and pure heavy metal, buy Kreator's Enemy Of God now and prepare to be beaten senseless.<br /><br />Be sure to check out upcoming albums from Slayer (I hope it comes out this year), Judas Priest and among others. STAY METAL.
B0006399FS|1.0|Strangely enough, have you ever noticed that U2's recents cause-related meanderings always tend to happen whenever they have an album, video, or tour to promote? It seems like a selective charity that has two goals - to raise issue awareness (something we acknowledge U2 does accomplish) and to sell U2 albums, videos, and concert tickets.  <br /> <br />For example, in September 2001 Bono organized a range of artists together to re-record Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On?\\" as a benefit for relief of AIDS victims in Africa. All proceeds from the sale of the single would go to debt relief and fighting AIDS in Africa. Sadly, no one notices that the song is for AIDS relief as the proceeds from sale of the single are also donated to the more high-profile Sept. 11th Fund... At the same time U2 were promoting a new single, \\"Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of,\\" and a North American tour.  <br /> <br />In May 2002 Bono went to Africa with the Secretary of the US Treasury, Paul O'Neill, to highlight the need for aid to the poor countries of the region. The \\"odd-couple's\\" trip was big news... U2 were also promoting their Elevation 2001- Live From Boston DVD, which was released in November of 2001. At the same time it was leaked that U2 signed an 'exclusive' with Best Buy to market the DVD, thus screwing over independent retailers. According to the terms of the agreement, Best Buy would have a two-week exclusive to sell a brand new U2 live DVD for $18 and also get the rights to sell an out-of-print U2 Greatest Hits Album.  <br /> <br />Let's talk about their 2000 music: You've got Bono's corny, over-the-top crooning that tries far too hard to win over 'emotions', with me it just all out fails to do so. Bono can't sing anymore, his strained rough fake 'emotional' voice is pitiful to say the least. Wearing a black leather jacket, his trademark blue-tinted shades and a roguish smile, he keeps selling 'U2' name alone. Bono is just an egomaniac <br />And you have The Edge, who has neglected to change his guitar style. There haven't been even a few interesting licks <br />since All That You Can't Leave Behind. Their music have become in something corporate dreadful. Some facts about U2 2000: <br /> <br />a) Highly overrated and overhyped.  <br /> <br />b) Past their prime in a big way.  <br /> <br />c) Very uninteresting live act since Elevation Tour.  <br /> <br />d) Overproduced, overhyped, overrated albums.  <br /> <br />e) Steadily getting worse with each album since ATYCLB.  <br /> <br />f) Corporate sellouts <br /> <br />g) A huge bunch of lies surrounding any new album. The same history about 'new album missed' since ATYCLB is an example. Moreover, all that fake \\"We apologize\\" by Larry Mullen at the Grammy Awards was rewarded with 3 Grammys and surely increased album sales and tickets since that day on. He knew U2 were in front of 600 million audience. Do you still believe that ticket scandal wasn't on purpose ? Do you still believe U2 didn't know anything about that ?. Please read 'an open letter to U2' and think ! <br /> <br />Sellout U2 2000 don't know what does 'DIGNITY' means. Time's cover magazine March 4, 2002 says it all. If I were them, I'd cancel 'Vertigo' Tour straight away. But they won't do it... money is more important than anything else...that's include fans feelings. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Top Gun never claims to have epic scope, emotional gravitas, or a deep plot.  I imagine that those who criticize this movie for its supposed shortcomings also look upon the Three Stooges with disgust for not exploring the depth of Moe's antagonistic relationship with Curly.  The fact is that only about 10% of films released in general circulation attempt to have the depth of a Citizen Kane or Godfather.  Among the other 90%, Top Gun is the best of the best. <br /> <br />Top Gun's obvious strength is the aerial visuals.  Not since perhaps Howard Hughes' Jet Pilot has there been such an ambitious attempt to capture the look and feel of high performance flight.  The F-14's photogenic qualities combine with Tony Scott's signature backlighting to create a terrific sense of energy and screen presence for the Grumman bird.  The tactical realism may suffer, but the tight spacing and resulting packed frames of the ACM sequqnces are uniquely energetic and fast-paced.  It is a shame that this may be the last time that anyone goes to the expense and hassle of using real film to capture such manuevers.  The footage still compares favorably to state of the art CGI 20 years after its release. <br /> <br />The non-flying scenes are remarkable only for the collection of young talent that would eventually drive box office returns for a good part of the '90s.  But the greatest compliment I could give the plot and acting is that they don't detract from the pacing and cohesiveness of a visually-driven movie. <br /> <br />*RE: Review Title- OK3 is the best grade possible for US Navy pilots performing carrier landings.
B00005JMX6|4.0|This was probably one of the most under-rated movies last year.  It got shafted at the box office - in my opinion a result of poor marketing.  From all the commercials on TV, the movie seemed like a brainless sex comedy.  The studio really pushed the sexuality of Elisha.  But this movie was so much more - great characters you actually cared about, great acting and great script.  The Girl Next Door deserves to be included in the league of smart teen-coming-of-age movies.
B00004Y6NX|3.0|Dire Straits' (or more particularly, Mark Knopfler's) desire to make more cinematic music really blossomed on their third album, \\"Making Movies.\\" The songs suddenly shifted from Bob Dylan territory over to Bruce Springsteen's world. As if to shore up that allusion, E-Streeter Roy Bittan contributed his keyboard skills and Springsteen production cohort Jimmy Iovine co-manned the boards with Knopfler. While this album serves as the bridge between the epics that appeared on \\"Love Over Gold\\" and the stylistic restlessness coming off the first two albums, it is also burdened by a second half comprised of weak material.<br /><br />But if this was the old age of albums, you could have just ignored the flat side two and just allowed the three glorious compositions of side one to play over and over on your turntable. From the opening strains of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"Carousel Waltz\\" that segue into \\"Tunnel Of Love,\\" to the energetic description of the roller girl in \\"Skateaway,\\" it was obvious that Knopfler's ambitions were keeping pace with his growth as a song writer. \\"Skateaway\\" could be one of the best songs ever written about the relationship between radio and a music lover;<br /><br />\\"She gets rock and roll from a rock and roll station,<br /><br />and a rock and roll dream.<br /><br />She's making movies on location,<br /><br />she don't know what it means.<br /><br />But the music makes her want to be the story,<br /><br />and the story was whatever was the song what it was.<br /><br />Rollergirl, don't worry, the DJ plays the music<br /><br />all night long.\\"<br /><br />\\"Skateaway\\" was a hit that got away in the years preceding \\"Money For Nothing.\\" If you can linger on the brilliance of that song, \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" and \\"Romeo And Juliet,\\" and ignore the pedestrian rock that adorns the second half (and a pox on the hideous \\"Les Boys\\"), then \\"Making Movies\\" will satisfy you. But if you're just looking for a casual listen to Dire Straits, there are other, better, albums to explore.
B0000542D2|4.0|Critiquing this film as a piece of cinema, and not as a collection of Beatles tunes is a difficult task. Richard Lester creates some truly beautiful black and white images. Though sometimes the camera can't seem to find its focus. And the images obviously taken on a helicopter as they boys play in the grass outside the television studio shake wildly and distract from the fun being had. The boys, though essentially playing themselves still play it a little stiff as if they are not sure how, exactly, to be themselves. The jokes, for the most part, are still funny, and what little plot there is, still works to give a glimpse into what it was like to be a band on the verge of universal stardom.  <br /> <br />To take the movie without the songs is well beyond the point, though. The movie is essentially a market ploy to get the songs heard via a different media. One might not be so forgiving if the songs were not any good, but the music shines throughout. The title song that starts the movie off starts with a struuuum that is instantly recognizable and jumps out and smack you in the face. That is followed by what is arguably the Beatles best tunes. When you add in such songs as: I Should Have Known Better, Tell Me Why, I'm Happy Just to Dance with You, the simple, sweet \\"If I Fell\\" and the sing along favorite \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" to the soundtrack then you have a musical that is just shy of remarkable. <br /> <br />The movie was released just before the Beatles came to America and appeared on Ed Sullivan which brought on the madness known as Beatlemania. By this time they were extremely popular as can be seen in the crowds reaction while the boys sings on the television show. It is still shocking to see images of teenage girls screaming, crying and shaking in a manner previously only known to the Pentecostal religion. The soundtrack periodically allow the girls screaming to take over the music allowing us to glimpse what it must have been like to be there. No wonder the boys gave up playing live shortly thereafter.  <br /> <br />A Hard Days Night is an excellent glimpse of the Beatles on the cusp of World Stardom. This was before the summer of love, drugs, and the sitar where the Beatles were just trying to be the best band in the world and writing songs that made them so. It is a joy to see them cutting up and being their goofy, hilarious selves. I dare you not to sing and dance along as you watch it.  <br />
B000007492|5.0|I remember growing up with SuperTramp. I woke up a year ago, thirty-nine years in age, and had to hear the \\"Logical Song.\\" I bought this compilation and was blown away.<br /><br />I don't generally like compilations. This is an exception. Wow! If you want to bask in the glow of the seventies, this is it. There is not one bad song on this CD. I had no idea that SuperTramp created so many phenomenal songs.<br /><br />There is a beauty to their music -- a romantic, slightly philosophical approach that is so terribly lost in contemporary pop music.<br /><br />The blending of songs is wonderful. I admit I've never owned an album of theirs, but this just rivals any top ten album one could buy. This doesn't stink of a compilation produced for more money in retirement years. There is an undescribable beauty to this CD.<br /><br />If you appreciate seventies music, you will cherish this compilation.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|For the love of all things holy, do not buy this album! Every track is the same pathetic set of idiotic lyrics, poor singing, and lack of talent. If you value your ears then cover them. If sound was matter this would be crap on a stick, I kid you not. Run far, far, away! Instead of listening to new stuff that sucks, try some older tunes. You might find you like them better (i.e. The Rolling Stones, Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, etc.). Buy at your own risk. I mean it isn't my fault if you want to have a HORRIBLE cd collection.
B00000272N|5.0|this is a good cd....before i get to the review...i read back that someone named \\"figgy\\" said that nirvana wasnt influential....well i defenitly think your wrong, sure alice in chains were huge also, but so was nirvana. Nirvana may get more credit to music then they should...but it doesnt mean they dont at all. and nirvanas first cd came out in 1989....so i dont think that alice in chains came out way before them...just so you know...nevermind brought nirvana out of underground, just like dirt did alice in chains. Anyways, this cd is great, awesome songs, layne stalley is perfect on vocals.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I had the privilege, and yes I use the word, privilege to see the Arcade Fire live in New Orleans.  It was the best live show I have seen in a long, long time.  What's truly amazing, is the energy, poetry and beauty that comes through the cd is evident tenfold during a live performance.  In a world where everyone seems or wants to be inaccessibly famous, the band actually mingled with the crowd after the show, graciously taking pictures, shaking hands and signing autographs. The Arcade Fire make genuine & beautiful music, buy their cd and see them live if you can. ^_~
B0000CAXIC|5.0|the foo fighters are nothing like nirvana,and thats a good thing. cause  cobain made that style of music and foo fighter were to try to sound like him would just not work,,, i think he does a good job at guitar/vocals and i really wish pat smear wouldnt have left the band , i would actually give this album a ten but it on goes up to 5 stars/
068987474X|5.0|Man. I just finished this book and although I laughed, I ached a bit out of pure empathy for single women everywhere. And mostly, I wished this book had been around when I was single.  It's a great read, and the book marketer in me thinks there must be 100 more episodes of Sex in the City that would make fine little books.  Since I hope to NEVER be single again - and if I am, truthfully, I don't think I'll even care if \\"he's not that into me\\" - it doesn't really apply to my life at this point. HOWEVER, I do know who can benefit from it in about fourteen years, my kindergartener daughter. This book is going straight in her hope chest!
B000002I2M|5.0|Sounding like his demons were finally about to overtake him, Jim Morrison truly sings like a man posessed on his final studio LP with The Doors. That may be a bit ironic because the music on this release is actually some of the calmest in the bands catalog.<br /><br />The entire record is an amalgam of assured blues vamps, pleading love songs and 3 ambient masterpieces (the title cut, \\"Riders On The Storm\\" and the astonishing \\"La Merica\\"), making this a cohesive, compact yet sprawling LP that contains no filler or throwaways. Morrison's voice is the main focal point here, but Densmore, Kreiger and Manzarek provide a lush, jazzy cushion of sound and texture that still sounds fresh 34 years later.<br /><br />Hearing Morrison's rich baritone fade into the ether on ...\\"Riders\\" and knowing that he left America for Paris soon after (not even bothering to stay behind for final mixing of the LP) and died without ever having heard the finished product is haunting and lends this LP and air of mystery and melancholy that stays with you long after the music's over.
B000000OU6|5.0|Wow!! Slash must the best guitar player of the last years! His technique is terrific, as well as his melodic riffs and weird chords!! He really knows how to make it sound neat and perfectly. If Axl was on vocals, this could be a great follow up to the \\"Use your Illusion\\" albums. Wow!! Must have it!!!
B000002H70|4.0|First of all, this album makes me think of that South Park episode that makes fun of goth kids. Dunno why. I guess the moody, broody feel of the album reminds me of something that a bored, teenage suburbanite would write.  That said, I was sucked in to the soundscape of this piece and found myself unable to turn it off until the end.  Took me an hour to become happy again afterward, but I'm so glad I gave this a chance.  Lullaby is one truly incredible song!
B00000DG1R|3.0|Back from the crypt with all of the same shrill vocal stylings and undulating tribal rhythms, Duran Duran's bark is worse than its bite. Let its warm arms wrap around you on the opening track whilst the bass line thumps along with the opening and closing of your tricuspid valve. Sounds so hot it'll melt your earwax. A must-buy, for fans of Jon Bones, Peter Murphy, and Ace of Bass.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|very happy to be here in america <br />with such a good cd! <br />willie nelson ya! <br />norah jones ya! <br />james taylor ya! <br />dont listen to the haters <br />they just mad this cd made so much $$$$
B0002VL0KQ|2.0|I love Celine, but her music hasn't been all that of late. I wish she would record a rock album! Her duet with Anastacia on Divas was sensational... <br />All you Celine fans, should check out an Aussie alternative!! COSIMA DEVITO. She was a finalist on AUSTRALIAN IDOL a 2/3 years ago. She got to the final 3 but had to leave due to throat nodules. Anyway, she couldn't get a solid record deal afterwards so she started her own company and DIANNE WARREN wrote and produced her ENTIRE first album. She has been compared to Celine but with an edgier sound! And true that is...check out this diva!!! [...]
0140283587|2.0|Review:<br /><br />You like to read unfunny books?  Then take it!!<br /><br />The novel \\" Are you experienced \\" starts very well, but then it becomes more and more lengthy, so that I have lost the interest in reading on.<br /><br />Although the novel is written from a first person narrator, I could not identify with or even understand the protagonist's behaviour. Sutcliff's style doesn't convince me, I have not found any parts in the book where tension arises either.<br /><br />In spite of this the story (two young people travel to India for three months during their gap year, because he wants to get her into bed and she wants to find herself there) is good, it's just not put well into practise.<br /><br />Nevertheless I'm proud having read it, because as Dave, the protagonist, says having done it is more fun than the doing it!<br /><br />Since I had to read this novel for school, I have found out many interesting details and so I can say that there is definitely more in the text than I thought before. But I would still not recommend it to a friend!
B00005JNBQ|2.0|If this was supposed to be social criticism, it's not. If this was supposed to be funny, it's not. If this was supposed to be avant guard, it's not.<br /><br />This film is weighed down by a desperation to be quirky and esoteric. I can just see the sweat on the screenwriters as they draw up the weirdest people they can imagine, which in reality is a serious case of writer's block. The problem mainly arises when the director refuses to stop assuming that the viewer thinks inactivity and vacuity is infinitely humorous. The acting is overly deadpan, stiff and lethargic-which I assume is on purpose. What ensues is viewer irritation after 10 minutes. This is especially true since the spurts of energy that we do see are irrelevant and gag oriented. This is a series of plotless vignettes,literally plodding on for 1 and 1/2 hours. The humor is odd and the director so self satisfied with his own smugness he didn't step back to think that esoteric for the sake of esoteric is...weird? Weird for weird sake begets confusion and loss of interest. As the Amazon review points out, there is no sense of disgust and anger-so we get twee 8 year old humor.<br /><br />This is an Indie film for people who don't like indies.
B0000039QA|4.0|Biggie was 1 of the few artists that put together consistently good music. After a debut like \\"ready to die\\" you wouldnt have thought it would be possible for him to reproduce, but in my opinion he does exactly that. He brings the usual raw street edged flow, elevates it with a hunger rarely found in establishes artists+takes it to the next level. The lyrics are grittier even if alot of the production is more polished+less raw that the last album. But with tracks like \\"kick in the door\\" (explosive), \\"10 crack commandments\\" and \\"whats beef?\\" (haunting) it soon becomes obvious youre listening to a legand!! This time round he also gives you a different side to himself with tracks like \\"skys the limit\\" and \\"miss u\\" (an ode to his fallen friends). With only possibly 3 \\"weak\\" tracks on the whole double album (\\"another\\", \\"notorious thugs\\" and \\"mo'money mo'problems\\") it was another great way to showcase his amazing lyricism. Hiphop lost a genius, no question. True NY hiphop in the highest form!!
B0006SSOHC|2.0|I have never written a review before, but given the recent group of horror/thriller movies, so called anyway, I was compelled to speak my mind.  I am a horror movie fan, have been for as long as I can remember, love the dark horror to the more cult type hits.  Anyway, SAW is not for everyone, especially those expecting to be scared or disturbed.  Mind you, there were some scenes to will disturb if you are easily disturbed, but in all it was not a major step forward in the horror/thriller genre.  If you have seen SEVEN then you have seen SAW!  Plus, a little of THE CELL thrown in there.    Cary Elwes was his typical self, which unfortunately is not really suited for horror movies.  I found it hard to believe he was actually concerned with his situation.  Chained to a pipe in a bathroom with another guy chained to a pipe across the room, Leigh Whannell, who was more believable as a victim then Cary who seems just kind of ho-hum about it.  It seemed to me that he was just shooting the scenes to get his check, which is unfortunate because I like him as an actor.  When your star, Cary Elwes, is out done by a mechanical doll and a little girl, Cary's on-screen daughter, then you have a problem.  The loose thread that tied them and all the other characters together was ready to completely let go about half way through.      Danny Glover, what happened to the Lethal Weapon star?  Starts as a cop who is searching for Jigsaw and just falls apart.  Your typical cop who is obsessed with catching the killer, who has a partner who isn't as obsessed, you can guess what happens to the partner, snaps, goes vigilante cop.  We see him investigate a couple of Jigsaw's murder victims, but it is more like who really cares?!  I saw, no pun intended, those murder types in SEVEN and done better I might add.    The scene where the female victim who had escaped from Jigsaw was the best part of the movie. You actually cared at that point. She explains the contraption that was on her head and what she had to do to survive, see the movie if ya wanna know, I'm not gonna spoil it for ya.  The freaky little mechanical doll was also a nice touch. But once we go back to the two guys chained to pipes in a bathroom, you just don't care.   All the scenes when finally produced and put together seemed to be a patchwork of edited parts.  You put the dead guy scene here, the freaked out guy scene here, a screaming little girl scene, a weird mechanical doll scene here, and shake it all about, you do the movie making and you turn a profit now, that's what it's all about!! Sorry.    And the ending, well, let's just say...So what!!  It felt to me like the script was written with a lot of holes in it and they filled those in is as they shot the movie and just said, \\"Well what do we do for an ending?\\"  When it ends, your just wondering \\"What the hell? Why is he so pissed at these people?\\"  These questions are answered, but it just felt like the killer's identity was decided on after they shot most of the movie. This movie could have been much much better, but it's attempt at a SEVEN type scare, just wasn't there.  Also, the director loves to use the fast motion effect, but it was way to abused.  I gave it 2 stars because of the dark settings, mood and the odd contraptions that Jigsaw used were innovative, but all the dark settings and weird contraptions can not make up for a weak story line.  I was more freaked out by the flying monkeys in WIZARD OF OZ.
B0000039PW|4.0|If you havent heard of biggie at this stage you mustve been chilling in the MIR space station+just got home. To you people, welcome back!! In many peoples opinion biggie was the best that ever did it. I'd personally have him in my top ten, easily. He had this gift of spitting hot rhymes that the listener couldn't help but be captivated by and completely believe at the same time. His voice just controlled whatever beat he rocked on. Believe me biggie got some seriously funky beats from the likes of DJ PREMIER, EASY MOE BEE and LORD FINESSE just to name 3. On each one he gives us some of the most vivid+imaginative narratives from his own experiences+from his vast array of tight verses. With only 1 guest mc on the entire album this was the perfect spotlight for biggie to enter+take centerstage on. In particular every track done by EASY MOE BEE is slamming like \\"gimme the loot\\", \\"machine gun funk\\", \\"ready to die\\" and the awesome \\"the whut?!\\" (with method men). \\"Unbelieveable\\" produced by DJ PREMIER is simply that and the finale \\"suicidal thoughts\\" by LORD FINESSE is surreal+scary as the lyrics are so dark. The album also bolsters such worldwide hits as \\"juicy\\" and \\"big poppa\\" so all in all you have a classic album!! Get it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is probably not a movie for the extremely cynical.  So it's no wonder why many critics, especially having already established a dislike for Lloyd Webber and Schumacher, did not give this masterpiece the credit it truly deserved.  One of the most beautiful films I have ever laid eyes on, \\"Phantom\\" is not meant to be analyzed--it is meant to carry you off your feet in one sweeping blow.  It is meant to be viewed by an audience prepared to let themselves enter another world more lush, more strange, and more unbelievable than their own--and it seems most audiences embraced the experience.  Like the sets and costumes, for which this film was at once praised and frowned upon, the melodic score surrounds every inch of you and settles itself in your head for at least a good week afterward.      Moreover, there is a heart at the center of all the gold leaf and curtains--in short, Schumacher has stuck with the formula that made the show a mega-success over the past two decades.  Like the show, not every detail of the film is perfect, but the overall experience can be described as nothing short of breathtaking.  Don't look for trendy, frentic camera work here: the film knows its larger-than-life source material, and so is done in a big, bold, Old Hollywood fashion--and the result is a very successful adapation of the world's most successful show to date.  There is no doubt that Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom\\" is a people-pleaser.      I saw this movie with very picky moviegoers...one had a great big smile on his face as he walked out and the other, although laughing during the film at some parts that seemed overly fantastic, had to admit it was wonderful and now wants the soundtrack.  As for myself--even being a big fan and once \\"purist\\" of the stage show for many years did not stop me from loving this movie (as you can see).    This film must be seen, if only for the visual wonder of it all...but most will come away with much more.
B00005J6T0|4.0|Madonna's True Blue was a superb pop album in its own sense.  It was the first of many hits she had with Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, each whom produced half of the album. Only on Where's The Party did she have both Leonard and Bray on the same song. Leonard's songs were more dance and beat-heavy, while Bray's had a smoother leaner feel. I can tell from their different sounds and styles. My favorite on here is White Heat, which blends very well in its fast pace after Open Your Heart.  Papa Don't Preach was banned from some stations in 1986 for a young girl keeping her baby and her father not approving in its lyrics. But in defense, there are some young women doing that and while it's morally wrong, it's their right and rebellion to do it. Live To Tell surprised me, perhaps a way to show Madonna's maturity and to ditch her former boy toy image. I still live the album version--I hated the single version--they cut 90 seconds of it for the keep-it-short-for-radio 4:25 single. There's a heavy emphasis on dance driven songs, as Where's The Party, Jimmy Jimmy, Love Makes The World Go Round prove. I like her Latin feel in La Isla Bonita. Does anybody know that she dedicated her album in her thank yous to \\"My husband,the coolest guy in the universe,\\" the time she was with then budding actor Sean Penn?  Well, they're no longer together now. The album sounds best on I-95 in all of Georgia near Savannah, Brunswick and south of it and central Florida.  It just has that feel of the coastal landscape down there.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Just forget the plot of the film or the themes of adolesent responobility yada yada yada... this film is worth every single penny just to see the sheer hilarity of some of the things that crop up! <br /> <br />Now i'm older, I appreciate more the little glow worm that talks to the girl... it is hilarious! The film is worth every penny for that scene. Secondly, seeing David Bowie jump about in those revealingly tight leggins is strangely funny and entertaining (i'm suprised they let children watch the film after seeing him in those leggins!) Thirdly, the way he dances and chucks a fake baby around during 'Magic Dance' is totally hysterical! <br /> <br />Other funny things are watching that fox riding on a dog... what is that all about! And seeing the 'Bog of Eternal Stench'! Okay, so maybe i'm being a bit immature now, but essentially this film is great! A cult classic! Everyone loves it!
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna's American Life is unfortunately her worst sounding.  She doesn't continue the momentum here like she did on Music.  There's so many keyboards and synthesizers here that drown out her voice.  And not a lot of the songs are memorable.  They don't hook into your head like the ones from Music and other albums.  Her reinvention factor doesn't help here. And maybe she should leave her personal feelings to herself and not overexpose them too much on this album.  But many top selling artists have one bad album within their career. I hope that Madonna makes a better album with the next one in the future. She's too multitalented an artist to sing through disjointed uneven songs as this album is.
B000002GYI|5.0|Computer World is my favourite Kraftwerk album, and I believe it is also their best. Some of their other albums had a greater impact when they were new but today they all sound dated, in different ways, whereas Computer World has not grown old. The group's earliest mainstream albums, Autobahn and Radioactivity, sound thin and old-fashioned. Trans Europe Express and The Man Machine sound too much like the early-80s new wave synthpop that they inspired. The only album of wholly new material that Kraftwerk released after Computer World was Electric Cafe in 1986. Nowadays Electric Cafe's sampled voices and sampled drums sound exactly like something from 1986. It is the only one of the group's albums that has dated badly.    Computer World, in contrast, is perfect. It sounds just as fresh today as it did in 1981. The only instruments are beeps, blips, and buzzes. The production is spacious and polished. The album's production is simple and fundamental in the same way that acoustic guitar music is simple; on this album Kraftwerk became the electronic pop equivalent of Nick Drake. With a few tweaks on the mixing desk, Computer World could be released tomorrow, and it would not sound old. Even the percussion, which so often sounds weak and comical in old electronic records, sounds awesome. The album was sampled well into the 1990s, and is still influential today.    And there is music. You can dance to it. You can hum it. You can play it on guitar. Each side of the record is programmed as a seamless set of songs which mix into each other, opening with the title track, which has a disco bassline reminiscent of the Bee Gees' \\"Stayin' Alive\\". Each track on the album is an influential classic (with the exception of \\"Computer World 2\\", which fades out the end of side one). You can hear house music germinating in the harsh, robotised \\"It's More Fun to Compute\\", and \\"Home Computer\\". \\"Computer Love\\" is a touching electronic soul ballad, an ode to computer dating. It is a love song,but it is not really about being in love or falling in love at all. Like Kraftwerk's other love songs it is instead about how technology can extend mankind's reach. The narrator of \\"The Model\\" would never have known about his object of desire in a world without cameras, and the narrator of \\"The Telephone Call\\" would be lost without the phone. \\"Computer Love\\" was released as a single, and it is a catch song. Against it, there's almost no bass drum, and the performance sounds ragged - the keyboardist even makes a couple of flubs near the end of the song. On the other hand, the blippy snare drum is a classic electronic noise that immediately entered the language of electronic pop music.    \\"Pocket Calculator\\" is absolutely loveable. Kraftwerk will always be remembered as an icy, grim-faced bunch of electronic futurists, but they had a wry sense of humour, and it is hard not to smile at \\"I'm the operator / with my pocket calculator\\". The original German lyrics were not quite as goofy (they went something like \\"I am the musician / with calculator in the hand\\"). The song is essentially an anthem for electronic music and electronic musicians. \\"Numbers\\" is almost an ancestor of industrial music, with its simple numeric rhythm and its fantastic \\"sproing\\" beat. It is an international digital symphony. You can dance to it. You can think about it. You can't hum it, though, and you'd have a hard time playing it on guitar.    If only the album had been longer. At a little over half an hour it is over too soon. It was released in Germany as \\"Computerwelt\\", with most of the songs in German, although the backing tracks were the same. There was also a Japanese-language version of \\"'Pocket Calculator\\", which was called \\"Dentaku\\", although again the backing track was identical. The band also went on tour to support the album, which was released at about the same time that \\"The Model\\" (from the group's previous album, The Man Machine) was topping the singles chart in the UK, and thereare several bootlegs of live performances.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Before I heard this Album I didn't know much about the band, I just had heard a few of their songs and never thougt much of them. But it was until I read great reviews on their latest album (Demigod). So I went to a concert to see them. ( w/ Suffocation, Cattle Decapitation etc). This concert made me realize how talented this band really is.  The drummer has a brutal approach with a machine gun type of drumming that is out of this world. The great thing about this band is that they don't lack the use of diversity in the other istruments, like many death metal bands now a days do. Also the singer has a unique voice, it doesn't sound like the typical death metal, his voice is kind of harsh but fits well. (By the way Cattle Decapitation sucks) <br /> <br />Overall: Behemoth might actully be the new polish metal kings with this album.  <br />Fav songs: Demigod, Conquer All, Xul

1400032717|4.0|Told by an autistic 15 year old, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is well worth its weight in cute feel-goodness. It's been on the bestseller list for awhile now. I guess that's why I picked it up. I could have done without all the math in the book but it was an integral part of the main character's personality (in fact, it was his forte) so I accepted it with a rolling eye. That's the thing with us English types. We're not big on the numbers game. Give me the alphabet over the abacus anyday and I'll give you a happy Bry. That said, forget what I just said.<br /><br />I've never read any Haddon before but I probably will pick up his other books at some point later in life. For now, Curious Incident was a very quick, easy, and pleasing read. There are emotions involved that any reader can't help but feel. First off, if you can't love the narrator, you probably can't love. The innocence that the mentally challenged can sometimes not help or understand themselves appears beautiful and mesmerizing to the (supposed) mentally sound(?). We feel for them, they hold a special place in our hearts. But as we see them in this light, it is all too easy to perceive them as children. Haddon, having worked with autistic individuals, understands their gifts and their daily challenges.<br /><br />His narrator, Christopher, is, well, curious. He is a whizz at Math. He can do any equation blindfolded and give Good Will Hunting a run for his money. But when it comes to human interaction, Christopher is very vulnerable. He has trouble with physical contact and freaks out when his father tries to hug him. Haddon portrays this anomaly with heartbreaking realism. It's hard not to get choked up for the father, incapable to physically express his natural love for his son; yet at the same time, you have to respect Christopher's wish and wonder how he, himself envisions his place in the family.<br /><br />When he finds his neighbor's dog murdered on her lawn, the world, with all it's real ugliness, comes crashing into Christopher's reality. He doesn't run away, he doesn't hide, he investigates. He makes contact with people and wonders why his father won't support him. It's an extremely confusing thing to him, this new and scary world. But he's definitely not afraid to take it on. And once he starts down his new and exciting journey, nothing and nobody will stop him from finding out the truth.t's real ugliness, comes crashing into Christopher's reality.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie may not have been the best in the world, but it is damn mezmorizing and I had the soundtrack stuck in my head from the first moment I heard it. It still isn't all out. The visuals and costuming are fantastic not to mention the lovely Gerard Butler, who if you don't fall in love with, you are, in my personal opinion, a very sick person.  :) I love his rendition of Music of the Night perhaps because I got to see the power of his performance, but if you haven't seen this, see it. If you don't like it, I'm sorry. <br /> <br />But this movie is my chocolate. Dark chocolate.
0385510454|3.0|But I didn't want to tell all my friends about it either.  \\"The Broker\\" is not one of Grisham's legal thrillers and is not as suspenseful as say \\"The Firm\\" but it was an ok read.  I like the aspect of having Italy as a backdrop for the broker to hide for a little while but the storyline didn't really go anywhere.  The so called \\"romance\\" that developed between the broker and Francesca was also too little too late.  Grisham attempted a big buildup for the ending bit it was very anticlimatic.  The more I read from Grisham the less I am starting to expect from him.  Save your money and borrow this from the library like I did, you'll thank yourself afterwards.
B000669GAI|1.0|the older songs kind of sound dated, and the songs from 1996 on fall asleep to Eddie Vedder's sleepy contentment.I was disappointed that there are no new songs,but after hearing <br />Pearl jam's last song  the humorless ode to parenting,\\"Man of the Hour\\" I was glad there isnt. <br /> <br />The last Pearl Jam album to have any real hit singles was 1994's Vitalogy.The songs after then (like \\"Nothing as It Seems\\" and \\"Who You Are\\")sound bored and drone on. <br /> <br />Maybe Pearl Jam should do something fun and light in their next release.Since the seriousness has lost its passion or  purpose.Maybe Eddie should write some standard rock star-supermodel kind of songs for Jill McCormick.Or go back to character songs.But the songs after 1994 are mostly skip songs. <br /> <br />The reason I gave one star is because I think all the five star <br />reviews are ridiculous.This is far from a perfect \\"Best of\\".The fact that older Greatest Hit albums from bands like Smashing Pumpkins are already outranking this new release speaks volumes <br />of Pearl Jam's short revelance in rock music.A one disk \\"Best of:1991 to 1994\\" would be far better.
0312263120|1.0|The problem with this book is not so much the technical absurdities, but rather with the strong implication of technical accuracy the author claims in the pages before the book starts.    Personal ignorance of computers, encryption, security and normal engineering are all prerequisite for enjoying this book.    Again, to all those who think those complaining about technical \\"inaccuracies\\" are nit-picking; Brown makes the strong implicit claim that he knows what he's talking about. The selling point of the book is that it's a PLAUSIBLE, well researched work of fiction. It is not plausible, it is not well researched; it is a work of fiction.    As such it is a very poor 'techno-thriller' with no qualities to appeal to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of what the book is about. IE National security, computer security, code breaking and writing, etc.    The only enjoyment I received from this book was in discussing it's many absurdities with my friends.
B00004T8RK|1.0|the fact that such a mess gets almost five stars shows that there is nothing that Pearl Jam's small but loyal fanbase will not consider a \\"classic\\".But I sold this cd to my used record store for less then a dollar the week after buying it.I couldnt believe how bad it was.Especially after the ok Yield.Its one long yawn. <br /> <br />Eddie Vedder had writers block when recording this (a fact he makes fun of in the booklet)and the songs have some of his worst lyrics.And the music lacks one memorable hook.If I had to pick Pearl Jam's worst album,this would be it.But the other reviewers would probably pick Ten or Vitalogy for being too mainstream.
B0002X314C|5.0|If you appreciate good singing and good music, then this album is for you. An artist like Legend is rare these days. It's hard to find a singer/songwriter whose talent is raw, yet so well cultivated. His success will only better the music industry. You need people like him to step into the arena and raise the bar even higher. It will make others think before they record. John Legend will certainly help to bring out the best in everyone. <br /> <br />One thing, the first half of the album is actually a nice contrast from the second. It's another demonstration of his flexibility. The album keeps moving along. It never really stalls or slows down. All of the songs compliment his voice and style. I look forward to his second album.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00020HEL6|5.0|She's only fifteen years old.<br /><br />Lavishly produced by David Foster, Renee Olstead's self-titled CD has garnered her praise from former teen idol Neil Sedaka, crediting her with vocals that are reminiscent of \\"Patsy Cline, Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday all wrapped in one.\\" Recognizable as a star on CBS Television's Still Standing, the effervescent Olstead seems poised for a career in the pop music wing of jazz and blues worlds--and she's only fifteen years old.<br /><br />There is certainly some great stuff on the recording--this reviewer's pick being the classy retread of Sedaka's own \\"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do,\\" where Renee is joined by fellow youthful crooner Peter Cincotti on piano and vocals. Equally good is the Linda Thompson composition written for Olstead, \\"A Love That Will Last\\" -a marvelous new slow and bluesy romantic ballad. Other unhurried and charming standards given a showcase by Renee's singing include \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Someone to Watch Over Me,\\" the former being the album opener and the latter featuring Chris Botti on trumpet.<br /><br />Groovy swing dancers and friends of the fox trot should rejoice, because this album comes with great new covers of \\"Taking A Chance On Love,\\" \\"Is You Is Or Is You Ain't My Baby,\\" and \\"Meet Me, Midnight,\\" all performed with class and all imminently danceable. Some neat curiosities include Renee's take on Maria Muldaur's \\"Midnight At The Oasis,\\" and the somewhat dawdling \\"On A Slow Boat To China.\\" Both play on the pixie quality in Olstead's voice, and help to sell an idea of whimsy and romance that is enjoyable.<br /><br />Strong production values create an album that is agreeable for a full listen, and while Renee Olstead and her fifteen years may not have experienced much of what she's singing, her voice and its rich complexity never betrays its lovely owner or the material.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is the first CD in a long time that made my spirits soar. The vocals are a lot of fun to sing a long with and the songs have a way of sticking in your head. It may not be the \\"deepest\\" album, but the beauty of it is piercing.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you're a Buffy fan, this is essential. If you're not a Buffy fan and by any chance happens to buy this album, be sure that you will be going into one of the most revigorating experiences of your whole life! <br /> <br />This is a breathtaking musical without one single weak moment. The songs flow in an amazing diversity of styles, and all of them are pleasant. You will have them in your head for weeks and months to come! <br /> <br />As curiosity, this CD has a demo of one of the songs (SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT)at the end, sung by Joss's wife and Joss himself playing the piano. It's very funny to listen. <br /> <br />It's a very, extremely good musical, and owning this CD will only make your collection far richier. <br /> <br />
B0007939NO|5.0|The reason I saw this is because I am a huge Gene Kelly fan and I love Cyd Charisse as well! This isn't the greatest MGM musical but it was one of the last ones from the \\"Golden Age\\" that make this movie very special. The movie is about two hunters named Tommy(Gene Kelly) and Jeff (Van Johnson) who are in Scotland. While they are lost they stumble into this little village that isn't on their map. The village happens to be Brigadoon and it happens to wake up for one day every one hundred years. Tommy starts to fall in love with Fiona (Cyd Charisse) but Fiona can't leave the village if she does the town will disappear forever. This movie has a lot of great music my favorites are \\"Heather on the Hill\\", \\"Waitin' for My Dearie\\", \\"I'll Go Home With Bonnie Jean\\", and \\"Almost Like Being in Love.\\" This is really one the last great musicals! This a must see movie! I am very happy that Warner Bros. re-released this on DVD with good extras! <br /> <br />Here are the extras: <br /> <br />First-ever New Digital 16x9 Transfer (2:55:1)  <br />Soundtrack Remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1  <br />Three Outtake Musical Numbers: Come to Me, Bend to Me, From this Day On and Sword Dance  <br />Audio Outtake: There But for You Go I  <br />Theatrical Trailer  <br />Languages: English & French  <br />Subtitles - English, French and Spanish <br /> <br />Go out and get lost and fall in love with Brigadoon!
B000002LGQ|4.0|Like A Prayer is the  song Madonna wrote for her mom who taught her how to pray. Very powerful words, music, and the choir is sensational. \\"Life is a mystery everyone must stand alone\\" what great a great message. This song is also very spiritual. This song went to number 1. This is an A+ song. The video is truley amazing and it tells us a story.     Express Yourself is very catchy song and talks about moving on \\"when the time isn't right\\" and  \\"You'd do much better baby on your own\\" which is so true in life. Don't wait around for people and dont get caught up in the fancy things of life. I give this song an A+. This song went to number 2.    I don't care too much for \\"Love Song\\". Its a duet with her and Prince. It rather slow and I skip it all the time. I would give it a C.    Till Death Due Us Part talks about her abusive relationship to Sean Penn and how he doesn't love himself or anybody else. It has a happy melody sound to it and it a fast song. I give this song an A.      Promise To Try is a sad slow ballad about how she worked so strong. It's on Truth Or Dare documentary where she visits her mom's grave. I think the song is beautiful and is very emotional to Madonna and you can hear it in her voice. I give it an A+.    Cherish is also a very catchy fast song.  She tells you to \\"cherish\\" people. I give it an A+.  This song also went to number 2.    Dear Jessie is an odd song that was put in there. It's ok but its not that great and reminds me of childerns song with her talking about elephants and pink lemonades. I would give it a B.    Oh Father is an awesome and beautiful ballad where she talks about how she was hurt by her father especially when he remarried his former housekeeper and how somebody hurt him too. He seems bitter about also about being hurt too. The song is also very emotional and sad. I give it an A+.    Keep It Together is not too bad its a fast song. It talks about how important family is and \\" how you will always have a home\\". I give it a B+.     Spanish Eyes is another pretty ballad. It has obviously from the title a spanish sound to it, and its not too bad. I give it a B.     Act Of Contrition is Like A Prayer played backwards. It starts off with a heavy rock sound to it.   The chorus is also added in. where Madonna talks about \\" confessing her sins\\" and \\"doing things\\". I give it an A. Over this is a great album. Two- three tracks aren't that good but the rest of the tracks are wonderful to listen to and they they all talk about life. I highley recommend this to all Madonna fans around the world!!! My favorites would be Like A Prayer, Express Yourself, Cherish, and Oh Father!!
B00002E224|2.0|I would like to stress again that the chemistry between Hawke and Delpy was near to nothing. I saw no sparks, no interest, and no bond. It was as if Hawke hated everything that Delpy did (see the poet and the fortuneteller), while Delpy just was looking for an American man to spend the day with. I felt as if she was trying to create that special moment from nothing, as if it was her goal for the entire evening with Hawke. She wanted to have one of those romantic evening for two in Vienna, and I caught from her character that anyone with half-a-brain would do well for the adventure. That person, in this case, happened to be Ethan Hawke. So, they attempt to have these moments, forcibly interrupted by Hawke trying to throw a kiss in there every once in awhile that wasn't scripted (to seem more \\"real\\") that only made Delpy seem disgusted. I just felt that when these two did kiss, they didn't really enjoy it as much as they should have. As I think about this point, I can't help but think of a line that Celine uses in this film. She states,<br /><br />\\"No, then it sounds like a male fantasy. Meet a French girl on the train, have her, and never see her again.\\"<br /><br />What if this was reversed on Celine, perhaps she was trying to find a man on a train, have him, then never sees him again. When I first met these characters, that was my initial thought. I did not see them together for the long haul, but after they talked for an hour and a half, I guess they had to fall in love. This was a totally mismatched pair by director Richard Linklater, and when you only have two main focuses in the film, I would have to say that should be your only job ... ensuring that you have two people that actually build chemistry on the scene. Hawke and Delpy did not.<br /><br />Speaking of Richard Linklater (director of School of Rock), I do not think that he had a good grasp of this film from the beginning. I think he was attempting to show, without too much of a script, if two people could fall in love after a chance meeting on a train. What would be the \\"real\\" reactions, and how would it ultimately end? Sorry to say that Linklater does a poor job with this film, especially the ending where it doesn't even have a successful climax. That's the worst part of the film-it keeps on going and going, but it really overstays its welcome and becomes too repetitive towards the end. That was not helping him at all by having this slow ending.<br /><br />I have heard people quote this film as the \\"greatest love story\\" ever. I would have to differ with them because of the characterization and portrayal of our Jesse and Celine. Both were uncomfortable, unstructured, and fractured in their parts and it was obvious through the screen. I have seen better love stories, and better stories will continue to be released!<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****ple could fall in love after a chance meeting on a train.

B0006399FS|1.0|I was hugely disappointed by this album. <br /> <br />Before you read on, know that I've been a long time U2 fan and I own every single album. Plus both special edition \\"best of\\" albums. Plus quite a few singles. Heck, I even have an old bootleg for the fun of it. These Irishmen are a very talented group of rockers. But there are a few problems. <br /> <br />First, Bono's ego is out of control and I can feel it squeezing out in the music. <br /> <br />Second, they've abandoned the mind blowing sopranos that they used to pull. There aren't any vocal tricks or audio fireworks at all. <br /> <br />Third, the music is shallow. These guys used to sing songs with deep meaning; spirituals and rock & roll songs about common, global issues. A lot of this music feels like it could've been written in fifteen minutes. <br /> <br />If you want a really good U2 CD, I'd recomend All that You Can't Leave Behind. That was probably their best. If you're more into 1990s Rocktronica U2, go with Pop. If you want some of their older stuff (which this album approached but failed to quite reach) go with Rattle & Hum or War. But Atomic Bomb is just a waste of time and money.
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|...and Apollo would be quite angry at Wolfgang Petersen for directing such an appallingly bad adaptation of the Iliad. In addition to the bad acting, uninspiring battle scenes, and mediocre direction, the whole screenplay stands in such contrast to the Iliad or even the notion of a Greek epic that it's laughable.<br /><br />In the Iliad, most if not all the characters are tragic heroes and there aren't really any good or bad characters: all of the mortals succumb to the will of the Olympian gods. Although the film's removal of the immortal characters was not a bad idea, the dispositions of the mortals characters were changed so much that they follow neither the plot or theme of the Iliad. In the Iliad, Achilles worried about his fate and valor as a warrior but wasn't the type to sigh over those issues to every other character in the story: he did this primarily to his mother, Thetis the sea nymph. The Iliad also presents Helen as being beguiled or even abducted by Paris but she was never really Paris' willing lover. Another poor arrangement is Achilles' relation to Briseis. The movie actually combines Briseis (a girl captured by Achilles' men on an island raid and given to him as a token) with the character of Chryseis (daughter to Apollo's priest whom Agamemnon captured but returned only after he had unleahed Apollo's wrath on his army.) The film shows Achilles having intimate discussions with Briseis about the war, politics, etc. It's as if the film forgot that the story takes place in 1200 B.C. and not 20th century era of the emancipated woman. As the Iliad recites again and again, a woman's place was to tend to a man's bed, spindle her loom, and care for the household. Also given that Achilles was more fond of Patroclus than women, I don't think he would have cared one bit what his female captive thought with regards to anything other than obeying his commands.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the film leads the audience to believe that the siege of Troy was a picnic lasting only a few weeks instead of ten years. The film has both Agamemnon and Menelaus die before or during the sack of Troy which is completely at odds with the story: this was done simply to have Helen run off with Paris again in the end. The latter is the most stupid part of the film both in terms of plot and theme. Even in the film, Paris is the epitome of cowardice and is anything but manly in battle: to have him live and run off with Helen into the sunset is to make the coward the hero. It's as if Dobbs in \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" kills everyone else and runs off with the gold. This type of plot structure is anti-climactic and undermines the entire thematic arrangement for an epic. An epic is a hero's tale, not a coward's: to make it otherwise isn't creative, it's just anti-climactic and simply idiotic.<br /><br />The battle scenes were uninspiring while the tactics and armaments were inaccurate. The phalanx was not a tactic used in the Iliad. The Iliad is quite descriptive in showing that the chariot dominated the battlefield while the infantry had a secondary role. The phalanx is a product of the citizen army of classical Greece, not the feudal armies of the Mycenean civilization. The funniest part is having Achilles' men use a Roman \\"testudo\\" or turtle formation that didn't come into existence until 1000 years later. The galleys shown in the film are also from the 5th century B.C. and not the 13th century B.C.: it would be the same as depicting Viking longboats of the 9th century as sailing vessels of the 18th century.<br /><br />In conclusion, this film is appalling in both concept and execution. I think it all starts witht he atrocious screenplay and Peterson's desperate efforts at directing this piece of trash into something watchable. I don't blame the actors too much for their lack of inspiration since they didn't have anything inspiring to work with in the first place. If you want to see this film because you never read the Iliad, don't bother: this film barely resembles the story. The plot is absurd and undermines the whole idea of an epic tale. Read the Iliad instead of watching this rubbish; it's more inspiring and Homer's battle descriptions are far more graphic than any of the action sequences in this pathetic film.
B00005R23X|5.0|Anyone that has read the book and then seen any of the many films based on it realizes that there is no such thing as a definitive film version.  Perhaps the style of the book prevents more of a literal film.<br /><br />But the book remains the taking-off point for a director's interpretation of the story.  As for me, any film that can capture some of the mood of the book is valid.  Each generation seems to have a need to tell the story on film, and each one will be different.<br /><br />This version does capture the essence of the book.  Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of van Helsing as an eccentric seems to me to be very fitting.  Could an expert in such things be really 'normal' himself?<br /><br />This film also deals with the sexual undertones of the book quite well.  Count Dracula is much more than a monster that sucks blood.  He is a tempter, something forbidden, hence even though a 'monster', holds a great deal of attraction.  Most films emphasize this underlying sexuality more than the book, for in the book Dracula is not portrayed as a handsome Count from Eastern Europe at all.<br /><br />So the book will always exist at a different level than any film based on it.  Perhaps the inherent differences between the visual medium of film and the written word of a book accounts for most of this.  But this film is very good, really takes us into a glimpse of the darkside.  Recommended!
1400043662|5.0|Murakami's ninth novel starts off with one foot set in a deep dream state.  It is such a deep dream everything feels real.  Even the emotions are real or perhaps stronger than real.  Then, he leads the next step with a realistic, post-modern account of the \\"toughest fifteen year-old in the world,\\" named Kafka Tamura, packing his backpack preparing to run away from home.  Effortlessly taking us from dream world to contemporary reality, Murakami's bold, maverick story telling has no boundaries.             From there, the novel uses a captivating labyrinth of metaphors to achieve a greater poetic truth.  The next character, Nakata, a sixty year-old man who because of some mysterious incident in his early child woke-up weeks later with no memories and illiterate a, tabula rasa.  However, \\"... Nakata not so bright,\\" finds he can communicate with cats.  Nakata's unwittingly finds his fate and travels are intertwined in some phenomenal way with Kafka's Oedipal adventure. But Nakata's not a mere foil of a character.  His endearing actions and dialogues combined with his vivid encounters, transcends his simpleton role and becomes more like Dostoevsky's Idiot.  Murakami gets to the heart of his characters. Even the smallest of roles fill you with empathy.                His efficient style and compelling descriptions allow, with out hesitation, fantastic occurrences like fish rain from a clear sky to ghostly characters.  He deftly uses incredible phenomena to describe a deeper truth. Character dressed like Johnny Walker, (I'm guessing the Black Label) World War II U.S. army reports, Colonel Sanders of KFC, articles in newspapers, and even Prince's Little Red Corvette are just some of his metaphorical arsenal.  But it is not just these modern and pop culture constructs he uses so well to pull you tightly in to his universe.            Latter in the novel, Hoshino, Nakata's truck driving companion sits at a coffee shop and listens to Beethoven's Archduke Trio.  We arenot only vicariously given precious, historical knowledge of the work but also a spiritual understanding of the piece even if one never heard it before.  Murakami is a true erudite.  He uses his impressive knowledge of classic literature, music, history, philosophy, and mythology in both eastern and western vain in such a visceral style it gives greater understanding of the works themselves.  The sexy, dream/spirit prostitute quoting Hegel is both appropriate and insightful. Murakami's clear and efficient style never talks over us but rather so clearly it is as if we are hearing him from within our head.     Kafka on the shore keeps you in a spell that is hard to break.  Intellectually stimulating yet an effortless read.   Murakami moves past Logic of the mind and in even beyond the past, present and future in to the illogical emotions and in to a metaphysical realm. Murakami makes this a true labyrinth as he eruditely writes:         \\"...Do you know where the idea of a labyrinth first came from?\\"        I shake my head.                  \\"It was the ancient Mesopotamians.  They pulled out animal intestines - sometimes human intestines, no doubt - and used the shape to predict the future.  They admired the complex shape of the intestines.  So the prototype for labyrinth is in a word, guts.  Which means the principle for the labyrinth is inside you. And that correlates to the labyrinth outside...\\" (326 p.)         Murakami once more metaphorically pulls his guts out on his ninth novel.  While it is up to the reader to divine their fate
B0001HAISG|5.0|Unlike past renditions of this classic story, this is truly Wendy Darling's story, as it should be.  Wendy is on the cusp of growing up, and this is the story of her struggles between childhood and womanhood with the temptations of both sides.  First time actress Rachel Hurd-Wood fits the role perfectly and do hope to see more of her on the screen in the future.  The Lost Boys and Peter Pan are well cast, and bring delightful performances to this film that both children and adults will enjoy.<br /><br />By far, the best of this film is Jason Isaacs cast as both Mr. Darling and Captain James Hook.  Isaacs is among the best of the true character actors in this age of all too many star actors who merely play themselves inserted into a role.  He becomes his character thoroughly and believably whether that character is Hook, Col. Tavington, Lucius Malfoy, or Mr. Darling.  He plays the convincingly shy and insecure, yet loving father very well, and plays Captain Hook with a flair and appealing quality never before seen in a Hook.  As Wendy said: \\"I find him to be a man of feeling.\\"  A man of feeling he truly is, even if those feelings are rather on the dark side.<br /><br />The DVD bonus features are wonderful, including a behind the scenes look at the set, commentary from Jason Isaacs as he tours the set with a camcorder; the pirate song that didn't make it into the film; set construction; teaching the children to fly; special effects and more.  My only complaint about the bonus features is that there aren't more of them!  This is a favourite film at my home already with my three year old and five year old, and is sure to be a favourite for any home with children.  Definitely one to buy!
031286504X|5.0|Sure, it's only February as I am writing this and I've only read 5 or 6 books but the title still stands.<br /><br />I am Legend was my first introduction to the wonderful Richard Matheson. I had never heard of him before this book and picked it up after noticing the many recommendations on a particular good vampire novel thread. The book itself is presented well and not only includes the great I am Legend but also a variety of short stories from the author some of which are as gripping as the novel itself. This is a book you'll fly through due to it's short nature but also because the writing style lends itself to quick reading with Matheson using mainly short sentences in his work. Therefore, it's not too complex and reads very well.<br /><br />The story follows one character for the majority of the novel. Robert Neville is the last living man in his area. He has boarded himself up in his home in hopes of evading the constant swarms of vampires that haunt him nightly(He goes out during the day and does some hunting of his own). The vampires here are not what I was expecting. Most vampire novels I've read present us with vampires as intelligent creatures. The vampires here are more akin to zombies with their lack of intelligence and primal instincts. Therefore, the novel centers around Robert Neville with no specific vampire characters.<br /><br />You can probably finish this book in one sitting. Some of the writing is particularly fantastic. One scene early in the play has Robert Neville staying out too late and having to speed home to avoid the zombies. The writing in that scene is just perfect with short quick, and thrilling sentences that really suck you into the novel.<br /><br />I give this book high praises not only for I am Legend but also the numerous quality short stories from Richard Mathenson. Not all of them in that group are good, but the majority are and all of them are worth reading. If you're looking for a good vampire novel, or even if you're a fan of zombie flicks then you should definitely pick up this book.ould definitely pick up this book.
0451526015|5.0|Oscar Wilde as leader of the literary wing of the Aesthetic Movement is by most accounts among the most bohemian of the Victorian English writers.  Just looking at pictures taken of him reveals his fascination if not preoccupation with the beautiful and luxurious.  Reading any work of his we quickly become privy of his style which strives for beauty and quality grammar.  His themes revolve around the lives of the well off in the late 19th century and the \\"Picture of Dorian Grey\\" is a prime example of Wilde's Work.  It is a full-bodied novel that fully takes itself seriously and builds up to a great climax.  The plot is relatively simple and while it gives itself away quite early we read on, luxuriating in the beautiful prose and excitement about what's to come.  The theme of eternal youth is something we can all relate to and in this world of extreme make over and botox it is a very relevant theme<br /><br />The book reads quickly and Wilde doesn't waste the readers time developing scenes even though some description approach the extreme.  And though Wilde tends to be more philosophical in this work than in others, it fits the story and is not ruinous to the overall effect.  This book is a necessary stop along the tour of 19th century English literature and it is a wonderful one.  If you enjoy it I recommend you check out some of his short stories: they are quick and some are very good.  I recommend this version since it is inexpensive and holds up quite well (I am destructive to books).<br /><br />Ted Murena
0671027344|4.0|The story \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" written by Stephen Chbosky deals with a shy but intelligent teenager called Charlie who is also the protagonist of the story.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book we meet his best friend Michael who committed suicide so he doesn't have any friends and doesn't know with whom to hang up. He has a good connection to his English teacher Bill who discovers his talent for writing and gives him books that he doesn't give the other students. Charlie tells him about his problem with making friends, so Bill tells Charlie to \\"get involved\\" and \\"participate\\". Charlie takes his advice and goes to a football game where he meets Sam and Patrick one day. They become best friends. Charlie feels comfortable beside them because after the death of his Aunt Helen who was his favorite person, they seem to be the only ones who really listen, understand, and accept Charlie as himself.<br /><br />Through Sam and Patrick, he meets other characters, goes on dates and high school dances, learns about sex, goes on parties and gets in contact with drugs and alcohol, he learns also about homosexuality and friendship, as well as about death and life. They show him a completely new world. He never would have done all these things if he hadn't found Sam and Patrick. Besides, we learn which important role his family plays in his life.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a good book. What I really liked about the book was that it talks about topics like sex, homosexuality, drugs, suicide, rape, abortion and things like that. While reading the author tells more in detail, his writing becomes more intimate and he opens up. For this reason, it was easy to put myself into his place. This way, the author also gives the reader a good look at all these topics. Besides, the reader gets the impression to be a part of the story because the main character speaks to you and calls you his friend although he writes to an unknown person. Stephen Chbosky shows you that growing up and to be in search of your own identity is a difficult process through which the most teenagers must go in the time of their puberty. Chbosky did a good job of developing his characters because everyone has his own special personality. What I also find very good is that we know exactly how he is feeling because the book is written in a diary style. It is a good feeling to know that a person you don't know really trusts and shares his secrets and problems that are going on in his life with you. He isn't no longer afraid and can show his feelings. The fact that he is male and cries throughout the story makes it more interesting.<br /><br />All in all, the book is easy to read and it isn't very long. It makes you think about your life and your past. When you compare your life with his, perhaps you will find some similarities because it describes exactly the life in high schools or how I imagine it.<br /><br />The only parts of the book that I didn't enjoy were the parts about his family because it was always repeated. It was also boring and didn't really interest me, for example Thanksgiving or Christmas.<br /><br />I think the message of the story is that it's normal to make mistakes because you will always learn into the bargain and make new experience in those ages. .hat growing up and to be in search of your own identity is a difficult process through which the most teenagers must go in the time of their puberty.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|The critics are wrong.  And I agree with every review here.  This movie surpasses anything I have ever seen in a film.  It is a new experience in a musical and I cannot praise it enough.  I will be putting in my pre-order for this film very shortly.  Gerard Butler is the most amazing actor I have ever seen and though I have seen many incarnations of the Phantom in film and on stage, I feel that his performance gives true emotional life to the Phantom and makes him someone we can all relate to.  All the other performances were great and I loved Minnie Driver's Carlotta...she was perfect for the role.  The story is beautiful and even though I've seen the movie close to 20 times, I will always draw in a breath when the chandelier is lifted.  Deny the critics.  Most of them don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber.  Go see it anyway, and I guarantee you you will want to own the movie when it is available.
B000069KGM|4.0|When most people think of Chicago nowadays, the first thing that usually comes to mind is those lovely Peter Cetera-sung ballads and catchy upbeat pop tunes. However, before the ballads and before the big hits, Chicago was a giant seven-headed monster brewing with new innovative musical ideas with a solid 'jam-band' sensibility.<br /><br />Released in 1969, Chicago's self-titled debut album, \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" (the band's original name) displays the band on-fire with a number of extended musical numbers. Tracks such as \\"Introduction\\", \\"Poem 58\\", \\"South California Purples\\", the cover of Spencer Davis's \\"I'm A Man\\" and the closing 15-minute instrumental \\"Liberation\\" all showcase solid group interplay with the band's three-piece horn section and Terry Kath's stinging lead guitar taking center stage most of the time.<br /><br />Although the album initially didn't generate any hit singles at the time of its release, several years later, many of the songs did get released as singles and have since become Chicago classics. The swinging \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" (presented here in its full version complete with a two minute solo piano improvisation) and the band's now-signature tune \\"Beginnings\\" (also presented in full here, clocking in at 8-minutes) are tracks that long-time fans associate with Chicago and are still standards that the band performs live today. \\"Questions 67 and 68\\" was also a minor hit from the album and introduced Peter Cetera's high soaring vocals to the world.<br /><br />\\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" is a solid group effort from start to finish and all seven band members get a chance to shine with plently of space here. However, if there is one musician from the band that truly stands out among the rest here, it would have to be guitarist/singer Terry Kath. On no other Chicago album does Kath let loose with some groundbreaking guitar work than on this one. His extended soloing in \\"Poem 58's\\" long intro as well as \\"Liberation\\" are up there with anything played from Clapton or Hendrix. \\"Free Form Guitar\\" is a seven-minute showcase performed by Kath in which he produces a plethora of sounds and feedback effects from his Stratocaster and amplifiers - a true buried treasure in the history of electric guitar playing. Terry's contributions to the music world were sadly overlooked by many and his untimely death in 1978 did nothing to errect him into 'legendary' status. However, Kath's work on this album is ample proof that he was indeed a guitar hero worthy of merit. One listen to this album is pure evidence of this.<br /><br />Indeed, \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" is still one of the band's very best efforts. After this, the band would begin to have greater success with hits such as \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"Colour My World\\" (from their second album) and eventually would find a niche in crafting out romatic ballads with Peter Cetera taking centerstage.

B00001OH7O|5.0|This one is nearly perfect. With the exception of \\"Fill Your Heart\\" this one is flawless. The rest of the songs are so amazing that even with one horrible song, it still rates 5 stars. <br />Some of the slower songs (Eight Line Poem, Quicksand) ache like nothing else Bowie has ever done. The rockers, especially the cd's finest 3:13, Queen Bitch, have a raw snarl and attitude that even the rockers on Ziggy can't quite match. <br />One of the best of all time and certainly the best early Bowie cd.
B000002BFL|5.0|I am a pretty young man, and I originally got into Springsteen when I bought his greatest hits when I was in high school. My friends and I would drive around the city and we would always listen to music and try to find some good music to play for each other. Since we were all young and just began exploring music, I threw in his greatest hits and played all the Born In The USA tracks that we all knew and we all thought were good songs--but to be honest at this point I didn't think Springsteen was anything more than another great singer/songwriter, but no one who would get more play than about 30 other bands and musicians out there. <br /> <br />Then one night when I was driving by myself to meet some friends out, I decided I wanted to hear a few more of his songs so I began to listen to the other tracks on his greatest hits and I came upon Thunder Road. The beat, music, and instrumentation, and everything else is great in this song, but the thing that really hooked me was the insight in the song.  <br /> <br />So I continued to go through his greatest hits, and songs like Atlantic City, The River, and Brilliant Disguise really jumped out at me. Right around this time, the Boss got back together with the E Street band in '99 and I was dying to see him in concert--keep in my mind, I knew the greatest hits inside and out, but didn't know much else of his stuff. When he took the stage it was like nothing I had ever seen, and being a big music fan I had been to dozens of concerts by this point. <br /> <br />I began to buy every Springsteen album I could get, and gave them all a few listens each because Springsteen's music doesn't always jump out at you--sometimes it takes a few listens, and reading through the lyrics to understand where his song is going.  <br /> <br />I would buy this album and not just listen to it, but read the lyrics as you listen to the songs and give it a few listens and get the poetic message of the lyrics that comes across flawlessly with the musical setting.  The Ghost of Tom Joad is a classic work of art, but songs like Across The Border, Highway 29, Sinoloa Cowboys, Youngstown, and Straight Time tell amazing stories and have great themes and insights.  Buy this album take a long drive and let the lyrics take you on an adventure of human struggle and emotion.   <br /> <br />No matter what anyone says, Springsteen has never made a bad album, he has just changed his sound so many times that people who are strictly into a particular sound of music pick out an album or two that fits their image of great music--to judge Springsteen by this manner falls short because he is a poet, and his music had to change to go where the lyrics and emotions led him. That is what makes him great, his lyrics and songs give you a real feel of what someone in a particular situation he describes or someone feeling a particular emotion would feel from the real lyrics showing dynamic emotion and character to the music which follows the vision of what it is all about. Springsteen is unique in the fact that his characters are never all one emotion, they are in love but hesitant, curious but cautious, sad but hopeful--his songs take you on an adventure and show you both sides of the story without judgment. <br /> <br />I would recommend all of his albums over about any other of the 400 CDs I own, but I would start with this one, The Wild The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, and then go to The Ghost of Tom Joad. This gives a broad overview, and the rest of his music is somewhere in between these albums.
B00001OH7T|2.0|This is easily the weakest Bowie album from his 70's heyday. Other than the hits, there really aren't any good - or even passable songs on here. <br />Check out Diamond Dogs or earlier or Heroes/Lodger/Scary Monsters <br />if you want a more challenging/rewarding experience.

B000002KO3|4.0|It seems that most Talking Heads fans sight this set as the favorite. It is unique, challenging and well worth owning. I've always thought it somewhat overrated, though. <br />The first half is flawless. It truly is classic.  <br />The last half of the album is just a let down, though. I like the last half, but it really isn't up to par with the first half. This really isn't a complaint, though. <br />It's almost like they set the standard so high at the beginning, that when the material settled down from breathtaking to simply excellent, the whole thing somehow seems incomplete. <br />Overall, one of their best, but I'd still have to go with Fear Of Music as the favorite....more consistent. <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|People quote this movie way too much. It was hilarious when nobody knew about it, but now it's way to over quoted. Jared Hess makes an unforgettable directorial debut with NAPOLEON DYNAMITE, a hilarious, tender, and original portrait of a truly eccentric character. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a high-school outcast in every sense of the word. More interested in playing tetherball by himself and drawing pictures of his favorite animal, the \\"liger\\" (a combination of a lion and a tiger), Napoleon is ignored by everyone in his tiny hometown of Preston, Idaho. At home, things aren't much better. His uber-nerd older brother Kip and ultra-vain Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) are too busy with their own obsessions to give Napoleon the time of day. It isn't until a new student, Pedro, arrives that Napoleon finds friendship and performs an act of brave defiance that makes him a true hero. Written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE masterfully captures the awkwardness of high school without succumbing to condescension. Most of this can be attributed to Heder, who steps into Napoleon's moon boots with a jaw-dropping flawlessness. The rest of the cast is just as natural, underplaying their roles and letting the comedy unfold without forcing any of the jokes. This is also one of the most unusual movies ever to be told on film. People please quit quoting this movie! You're ruining it for others.
B00001OH7N|4.0|This is the one early set that has a really heavy feel to it. <br />I'm always suprised by the straight-forward kick this one delivers. <br />Width of A Circle is amazing. All The Madmen is equally powerful. <br />The title track is still great, even after Nirvana took a half-hearted stab at it. <br />The whole thing has a very dark feeling to it....the closest to angry any Bowie set has ever been. <br />Well worth listening to....over and over and over and over...
B00005JMYI|4.0|It's a one-joke premise. This is very quotable and is actually rewatchable. Each character is steriotypical but to the extreme, mix that is with the quirky personalities, and you have an undeniably funny cast. Will Ferrell stars as Ron Burgundy, the top-rated anchorman in San Diego in the `70s. Feminism marches into the newsroom in the form of ambitious newswoman Veronica Corningstone Ron is willing to play along at first-as long as Veronica stays in her place, covering cat fashion shows, cooking, and other \\"female\\" interests. But when Veronica refuses to settle for being eye candy and steps behind the news desk, it's more than a battle between two perfectly coiffed anchor-persons...well it's all out war. The comedic take on a woman invading the news desk in the 1970s was inspired by a decidedly more serious documentary on the women who actually broke that glass ceiling. Will Ferrell was watching the documentary, which featured interviews with several anchormen of the 1970s, and found some of the interviews with the newsmen to be unintentionally funny.
B000002KNY|5.0|Every song on this one speaks to some sort of fear - the Talking Heads were anything but. This is one is pretty much perfect. It's experimental, but the songs have enough structure - and offbeat humour - to keep things centered.  <br />How can you not laugh at a line like \\"What's that I smell? I smell home cooking.....It's only the river, it's only the river\\" <br />Sounds like they recorded it in New York, alright.... <br />And we haven't even made it to the funniest song, Animals. Hilarious! <br />Cities, Air, Heaven and especially Drugs and Electric Guitar are all amazing songs.  <br />This is definitely Talking Heads at their peak.
B000002GXJ|5.0|The Eagles Live is a killer double live album from released in 1980. The majority of the songs were recorded during the supporting tour for \\"The Long Run\\" album. Over half of the songs on the album are from \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"The Long Run\\". There are also a couple of Joe Walsh's solo hits that made the album, Life's Been Good and All Night Long. Eagles Live is a great album, the only downside is that there are only a couple songs from the first few albums, however if you're an Eagles fan, Eagles live is great addition to your collection.
B0000013GT|4.0|the fact that that amazon lists the following other artists as ones you may be interested in if you pick up this album: Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Ludacris and Britney Spears. Where has Outkast gone wrong in recent years?    It's simple, if you enjoy Superbowl halftime shows and TiVo MTV for your favorite TV shows, please DON'T buy this album. ATLiens is nothing like the new stuff. This album is raw. It's scuffed. It's a 93 degree Atlanta summer Friday afternoon and there's nothing going on but bad traffic and this album.   Pick it up if you liked the first (SouthernPlayalistik...) but don't bother if Speakerboxx/LB is what you are looking for.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye first and foremost is a genius. The album is packed with socially concious, funny, and overall good music, (similar to Mos Def) whether he's spitting witty wordplay (\\"Get Em High\\") or plucking at your heartstrings, (\\"Family Business\\") the roc's lead producer has made an extraordinary album sealing a future in rap music. If being universally critically praised and being deemed a classic album by rap magazine XXL hasn't already made you believe in \\"the Louis Vuitton Don,\\" take my word for it. The College Dropout was released well over a year ago, and fans all over the world including myself are still listening to it. The future of rap has arrived, and for all those that say hip hop is dead, how can it be when Kanye is still alive? Buy this album immediately, listen and love it, and then wait impatiently for what is sure to be another musical gem...Kanye West's follow up, \\"Late Registration.\\"
B000000WJZ|4.0|man, that's a long time... this album doesn't sound like 1993 AT ALL! If you perhaps missed this albm when it came out (as I did, unfortunately) it's not too late to enjoy it. <br /> The deep sound that the Smashing Pumpkins get on their albums is really nice, plus they plain knew how to just rock. SD is a fun album!... not just nostagic for those who graduated high school from 1993- 1995. Get this album.
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|I've always felt that a movie should stand on its own merits, regardless of previous versions.  Yet I feel compelled to analyze why this film doesn't work as well as the original. <br /> <br />First, the era.  I somehow feel that the U.S. version would have worked better if set in the 1950's, since Japanese society seems to bear certain similarities to that era, with its inhibitions.  The Japanese woman was a homemaker - and therefore her husband's possible infidelities would be a threat as well to her way of life.  The independent career woman played by Sarandon is in a much different position. <br /> <br />Second, the actors.  Gere and Lopez are just too recognizable, yet not the kind of great actors (like Ben Kingsley or Meryl Streep) who can just melt into their roles.  I'm all too aware that this is Gere and Lopez that I'm watching, not their characters. <br /> <br />Third, the milieu.  Why change the ordinary middle class salaryman of the original into an upper middle class attorney?  Somehow, it's easier to sympathize with the ordinary accountant who feels that he will be stuck the rest of his life in his boring accounting job in order to support his family and pay his mortgage than it is to sympathize with Gere's more wealthy character. <br /> <br />Fourth, I agree with other reviewers that this film lacks that subtlety of the original. <br /> <br />So maybe I would have liked this better if I hadn't seen the original.  But I can't change that. <br /> <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Having seen the stage production in all its glory 3 time, I was convinced that the Motion Picture version could never equal the \\"live\\" presentation.... I was WRONG... WRONG... WROnG... After viewing the movie version 5 times, I am still mesmerized by the excellence of the production.  Emmy Russum is the true \\"Christine\\" and fits the role as if she were born for it.  Gerald Butler makes his mark as \\"The Phantom\\" in the best tradition and his voice and visual reactions gives one, moments that simply do not exist in a stage production.   The visual effects created by cinematography, especially the sequence of the transition from \\"old theatre to the present\\" is so realistic, one can almost \\"smell\\" the dust in the old theatre as it is transformed.  The pagentry of the \\"Masquerade\\" number far surpasses the stage version... costumes ... color... lighting... a true masterpiece.         Another memorable moment is on the roof of the Opera House... the Phantom is concealed behind a statue as he listens to Raul and Christine sing of thier love ... with \\"All I ask of You\\"....even with all his evil... you can feel the pain in his heart as he watches them embrace.  His vocal response in song after they leave is not only touching... but one of the many highlites of the entire production.   If you have any \\"heart and mind or soul\\" for beautiful music, that for once, has been performed as the composer intended... you will join me in watching this splendid creation over and over again.  See the motion picture... buy the DVD and share this Masterpiece time and again.  Thank you Andrew Lloyd Webber
B0002X314C|4.0|So High, Refuge, It Don't Have to Change, Stay With You, and Used to Love U are the best on this album for me. I'm actually beginning to feel Number One, I Can Change, Alright, She Don't Have to Know (of course I would never behave this way, but the beat and the flow are both good). I DEFINTELY believe that Ordinary People is going to get PLAYED TO DEATH on the radio and join the status of overrated songs.  His voice is very nice, but it doesn't stand out from anyone else I've heard.  Whomever said he sounds like Carl Thomas was thinking the same thing I did when I first really listened to Ordinary People on the radio. However, I do find myself singing the songs as I'm walking or just doing other stuff.  It was also good to hear him playing the piano.  I have so much respect for true musicians (the piano is no easy task!) who do not simply rely on the mixing board and all of that fancy equipment.  If you can do more than just dance around a stage, you are good with me!  The piano accompaniment (sp?) to Used to Love U is so amazingly subtle that unless you know music, you'll pay it no attention. I used to play in a classical band, so I always look for the subtle things that can \\"make\\" a song. I had no idea he was on Ms. Hill's Everything is Everything.  Great song!      I do agree that the album can be divided into two parts: the Hip-hop laced half and the Soul-laced half.  The first half is probably more hip hop-like with Kanye rapping and talking about male genitalia. The first half features the songs that are just enough to reach out to the MTV faithfuls. I am convinced that Kanye is the new Diddy: rapping in songs where he really doesn't belong and inappropriate and corny lyrics.     I'm a soul person at heart, so this album is a good mix of soul and R&B for me. Hopefully he will only continue to hone his talents and not go in the opposite direction and sell out. Oh, and I hope all of this praise doesn't jinx Legend...this album is good but before we put it on classic status, let him put out another album and prove himself a little more.     BTW, just bought his live cd from [...]  I am a SUCKER for live albums!  As a matter of fact, I'm in NC, but I'm thinking of going home in April to MD to see him with Alicia Keys.       BTW, I have edited this review about six times.  It just gets better and better for me.
0393317552|5.0|Try not to be put off by the title; yes, they do feature prominently in the book, but that is not the basic thrust of Mr. Diamond's excellent book. <br />This is more about how equally intelligent 'tribes' of the same species came to differ so greatly in their development, and ultimately why one faction now pulls the strings of the world. <br />To examine this in the correct perspective, Mr Diamond goes to the dawn of pre-history, asks the questions a child might ask, then attempts to answer them as convincingly as possible by drawing on the vast resources of available data and his own formidable intellect. Strangely, this doesn't result in a dry-as-dust treatise you might find in Nature journal, but in a highly enjoyable, thought-provoking read, illustrated by many little-known factual historical events. Many of the chapters did appear in Nature, as it happens, but the reasoned logic and step-by-step arguments make this as accessible and readable for the lay reader as the academic. The chapters on how and why our food came to be domesticated are particularly llluminating. <br />Naturally, in a book of such scope, there remain many unanswered questions, but surely this will stimulate much more debate and research - at the same time correcting some long-held racist dogma. <br />An excellent read. *****
0765309408|3.0|Good book.  However, a web review I read said, \\"Scalzi's book is lots of fun. But a better recent homage to Starship Troopers is Robert Buettner's new novel, Orphanage, about an angry asocial outcast who joins the military to fight an alien assault on earth. Orphanage is funny, thoughtful, and vastly more intense than Scalzi's book.\\"  I agree, and Orphanage costs ten bucks less. <br /> <br />
B0006IIPIK|2.0|Okay, how on earth can the title be sky captain when the characters spend the majority of the movie on foot? With a title like sky captain I expected wall to wall dogfights and star wars style acrobatics. He shoots down exactly two enemy aircraft in one scene and that's it. The rest of the time he spends wandering around sepia toned cg backdrops (about as boring as matte paintings most of the time, and about as animated) and arguing with Gwyneth Paltrow. <br />  <br /> <br />The plot of the movie is the basic \\"characters go from point a to b to find out where c is.\\" And that's about how interesting it is as well. With such a simple plot, one would expect lots of action. If watching two thirty-somethings bicker like junior high students  over \\"who broke up with who\\" is your idea of action, this is the action adventure of the century. I'm not kidding about the bickering: it takes up around half the script. When the writer was looking at the first draft did he really believe that having the two leads spit venom at each other for the ENTIRE film would endear them to the audience? Of course he didn't, the film reeks of pretentiousness. I state once more that this is not a romantic film: at the end of the movie the two leads still hate each other deeply. <br />  <br /> <br />Sky captain is a pretty pathetic hero when it comes down to it. His only nemesis in the movie is the lumbering masses of robots that were so prevalent in the commercials. He manages to either lose or draw in every encounter. He manages to get captured on three separate occasions, saved only by the ineptitude of his enemies. In every fight he needs either Paltrow or Angelina Jolie to come and rescue him. He is dumb enough to let his plane run out of gas, break his friend's ray gun, and fly into nearly every obstacle in his path. How is he endowed with the such a reputation that New York would call on him in lieu of their own air force? <br />  <br /> <br />The sum of this movies parts is that it was apretentious attempt of a \\"film noir fan\\" director to imitate his favorite serials of the 1930s. The \\"action\\" was only there to be put in ads so that he could lure people in to watch long scenes of a blurry, desaturated Gwyneth telling Jude why she cut his fuel line, got him imprisoned, and that he deserved it.  <br />
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Overall this is a good horror movie. It is one of the most brutal movies easily. However there are some problems.  <br />SPOILERS! BEWARE! Read at your own risk.  <br />1st off the detectives suffer from stupid cop syndrome. They go to the suspects place and break in without a warrant. I'm no lawyer but I know all evidence they find from that point on is inadmissable in a court of law (rightly so). At that point you want the killer to kill them because these detectives are so stupid. <br />The way the killer toyed with his victims is great, plus as they point out he never actually kills anybody. The ending of where the killer is was great but I do have problems with the actual killers identity. The major flaw of the film is the killer himself. A man dying of an inoperable brain tumor will not have the energy to build elaborate razor wire pits, iron death masks, or just have the strength to overpower their victims every time to capture them. No doubt in the sequel they'll find him in a cancer ward. Making the killer like this took away the believability. <br />Overall this movie is enjoyable to watch and is recommended if you like serial killer movies.
0224063782|5.0|Right away you notice something different about the book. It is written from the point of view of a 15-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome, which is essentially a type of autism. He is amazingly brilliant with math, and likes everything in his life being orderly and as mathematically based as possible. He is constantly coming up with equations to help him understand the world around him. He cannot however understand emotions, does not like being touched, and has little (if any) intuition in many scenarios. (For example, when asked to guess what was in a candy tin, he said candy. It was opened and there was a pencil inside. The tin was then re-closed and he was asked \\"What would your mother walked in right now, what would she guess is inside the tin?\\" and he said a pencil.) The best way to describe him is being almost entirely left brained. All logic; no emotion. In a sense, he is entirely objective... no emotions to cloud the thought. <br /> <br />As I continued my journey, I got pulled out of my world and into his. If you've ever wanted to get inside someone's heads and know their thoughts, know how they perceive the world around them, what upsets them, how they react to things, how they deal with stress, how they feel about others... really get inside the brain... well, this book is for you! You are totally immersed in this brilliant child's mind. Suddenly you become fully aware of this entirely different way of viewing the world, a different way of processing information and facts. It seemed like I gained a whole new understanding of the world about me by reading the book. (A truly special journey for those who are very right-brained, especially!) <br /> <br />I get lost in thought sometimes, wondering about our brains and how so much is unused and how great it would be to utilize those portions... or I think how great it would be if my memory was able to remember everything... but then I think that would be too much, too difficult... there is perhaps a defensemechanism within most brains that allows us to only see what we need or want to see, so we don't become totally over stimulated and shut down. <br /> <br />Christopher, the autistic narrator, seems to have proved my theory correct. He sees and remembers everything. He can't just glance down a street and think, \\"here is a tree lined street with several three flats\\" he takes it all in. Every last detail is forever stored in his brain. How many trees, how tall, which kind, their exact location, what flowers are around them, how many cars, what colour they are, what stickers they have on them, the type, where street lights are placed, etc etc etc ad nausem. He won't forget any of it. He can say on which day at which time he was where, and what the exact looks of everything was. For this reason he has an immense distaste for new places. They are too overwhelming, his brain taking every detail in. Imagine trying to go to a mall when your brain is taking in every detail in camera-like precision. How many people there are, what they are wearing, where they are located, where they are moving, what they are doing, and the overall surroundings about you. As Christopher describes it, it is like the blue screen of death.  <br /> <br />I would love to dissect every last bit of that book, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone who would want to read it. Definately worth the read!
B00005JN4H|1.0|Dreams and aspirations often indicate what kind of profession a person intends to pursue.  In Taxi, which is a remake, the audience gets to follow two people with very different aspirations, one a cab driver and the other a police officer. Belle (Queen Latifah) has worked hard over the last five years, as a bike borne delivery woman, to accomplish her goal to become a cab driver.  The long and hard work has also affected Belle's relationship with her boyfriend, as she has been preoccupied with fulfilling her dream.  Her dream is to drive her own cab, a boosted Ford Crown Victoria on steroids in superior James Bond style.<br /><br />Police detective Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) finds himself being demoted and having his driver's license suspended by his superior, Lieutenant Robbins (Jennifer Esposito), as a result of a car accident during a stake out.  Without a drivers license Washburn is forced to use public transportation, but when he overhears a bank robbery in progress over his portable radio he takes a cab to the crime scene.  This cab happens to be Belle's improved Crown Victoria, and it is about to put her career and relationship on the line while Washburn keeps digging himself a deeper hole.<br /><br />Together Belle and Washburn begin a long uphill road in order to redeem themselves in regards to their professional careers and private lives.  This journey takes them through eye-boggling car chases, death defiant stunts, and a couple of lessons in how to drive a car.  These dangers are stitched together with slapstick humor and frequent situational jokes in regards to Washburn's stupidity, insecurities, and inabilities.  The humor and jokes are clich&eacute;s from previous unoriginal films, which makes the jokes more mind numbing than humorous.  The timing of the jokes seems to be missed, as if the audience knows the punch line before the joke is presented.  This makes much of the humor silly, untimely, and overall less funny.<br /><br />Taxi presents some high-speed car chases in New York, but many of them seem to go on forever as if New York City had mile blocks.  The bank robbers' ability to hit targets the size of a quarter in 100 feet distances while moving with a handgun presents a new level of sharp shooter.  These marksmen make Sergeant Riggs in Lethal Weapon look like a ten-year-old that still wets the bed.  Therefore, these scenes create much awkwardness and it appears that the car chases and the other action scenes were intended to induce some form of suspense, but fail drastically in doing so.<br /><br />The combination of humor and action has been used efficiently before in films such as 48 Hrs. (1982), Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987), and Die Hard (1988).  In Naked Gun (1988) the viewers could see parody in action, as it made a mockery of the films made before that brought the audience action, suspense, and comedy through the law enforcement.  Taxi attempts to deliver a film that walks on the ground in between the parodies and suspenseful actions, but never accomplishes to give suspense or comedy.  And as far as the message of following ones dreams and aspirations, well, it is lost somewhere in the beginning.  Overall Taxi offers a cinematic experience with very little true humor and suspense and would even make a nervous person fall asleep. Let us hope that Tim Story does a better job directing his upcoming Fantastic Four, as he did with Barbershop (2002).eed car chases in New York, but many of them seem to go on forever as if New York City had mile blocks.

B000062YAZ|5.0|Extremely fast and brutal. Love it :) <br /> <br />Typical Slayer: very crisp guitar riffs combined with very fast drums. Probably the most influencal trash album ever.  <br /> <br />1. Angel of Death: THE Slayer song of all time 10/10 <br />2. Piece by Piece: good combination of fast - slow, speed, lyrics, breaks, .. 8/10 <br />3. Necrophobic: Very fast and brutal, love the breakdown in the middle of the song 8/10 <br />4. Altar of Sacrifice: Not my most favourite track 7/10 <br />5. Jesus saves: one of my favourites, \\"head-bang guitar riffs\\", LOVE the lyrics 10/10 <br />6. Criminally Insane: Good, slow impact full intro , but a bit choppy ;) afterwards 8/10 <br />7. Reborn: clocking under 2:11, fast, effective, 8/10 <br />8. Epidemic: not my favourite but good melody. 7/10 <br />9. Postmortem: excellent guitar riff! love it 9/10 <br />10. Raining blood: well-known guitar intro, riffs riffs riffs!!!, 10/10 <br />11. Aggressive Perfector: while being a classic, it's not my favourite. 8/10 <br />12. Criminally Insane (remix). Don't really know how I feel about this song. <br /> <br />It's a must have in your cd collection, one of the most influencal albums on the metal history. <br /> <br />To all the kids here saying that Slipknot, Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach are so much better: you have to realize that this album was recorded in 1986. Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit were not even old enough to hold a guitar. I even think that without Slayer and others there would never be bands like Slipknot and others. By today's standards this album might not the most creative (if you call samplers and turntables creative) but go to a Slayer concert and they will blow everything to pieces, including Papa Roach pussies and 'i-want-to-be-tough-limp-bizkit-wannabees'
B0002234LS|3.0|As I sat down to watch this movie, I knew from the beginning this was adapted from a short story by Stephen King (is it me, or has Hollywood signed a contract with King agreeing to make at least one of his books or short stories into movies every other year at a BARE MINIMUM??) which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  King IS one of the most creative forces in the world of literature the world has ever known.  Some of his works are pure genius...others...pure drivel.  As 'Secret Window' began, I became quite convinced this was going to be a real treat.  Well filmed.  Suspenseful.  Well acted.  Unfortunately as the movie continued on, and the REAL reason for our main character (played wonderfully by Depp) and his problems with a redneck psychopath who is convinced his story was stolen become apparent, well I began to have flashbacks of the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />You may wonder just how in the world I can compare these two movies, huh?  Well its quite simple, actually.  Remember Gollum and his strange split-personality and how he would sometimes talk to himself and work to convince himself that the One Ring was HIS?  The portion of 'Secret Window' where Johnny Depp does the same thing kinda weirded me out, and I have to admit, made me think of Gollum right off the bat (and not just me either, my son said the same thing).  Despite this small similarity, at the point where Depp begins to interrogate himself, the entire feel of the film began to seriously deteriorate.  What WAS a fairly decent suspenseful movie suddenly became a parody of itself and almost crashes and burns.  I found the last scene to be really, really odd.  Sure, I got the whole sinister joke of it, I just found it to be very UN-funny.  Not in poor taste, just not funny.  I also found what many people thought was a very clever plot to be quite the opposite, actually.  All I can say is this: the first part of the movie was very well done.  The last part became just plain strange and un-interesting, which is sad because I really wanted to like this movie.which is sad because I really wanted to like this movie.
B00005JHAB|3.0|Unlike Maid in Manhattan, which was a rather pleasant surprise, The Wedding Planner was a bit of a disappointment. <br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is average, while the humor and the dialogues are below average. <br />The characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting.   <br />Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey is not all that great.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given.  To make things worse, the \\"Italian\\" guy was anything but Italian; it was pretty obvious that it was an American doing a very poor job of impersonating an Italian.  <br />Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.   <br />A shame really... <br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  <br />No masterpiece here... <br />
B000000H5J|4.0|Demanufacture is a album of Fear Factory at a point in their career at a cross road and this album suffers a little as they tested new beats and styles and rehashed old songs with new remixes. This album will appeal to all tastes and the songs to watch out the most for on this record is 'Zero Signal', 'Replica', and 'Flashpoint'.<br /><br />The bonus songs are nothing to really talk about, the remixes sounded good if alittle bland. Personally for me I had a inkling that something was missing from this album. The best of Fear Factory surfaced on their prior album 'Obsolete'.
B00005QZ82|5.0|An outstanding romantic comedy, French Kiss, brings to the screen the love story between an American, whose Canadian fianc leaves her for a dashing European woman, and a French con artist trying to smuggle a stolen diamond necklace out of the country. <br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.   <br />Meg Ryan, Kevin Kline, Jean Reno and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.   <br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor (!!!), and the music are all wonderful! <br />In short, French Kiss is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|In my experience with this film most people who watch it have one of a few reactions. Here they are: <br /> <br />1.\\"I can't believe how boring and pointless that movie was.\\" <br /> <br />2.\\"That movie was so stupid it's funny. I could've made a movie like that.\\" <br /> <br />3.\\"That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time!\\" <br /> <br />A small group of people end up in the, \\"Yeah, it was kinda funny\\" group. In other words, if you still haven't seen this, chances are you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it. When I walked out of the theater after watching this film I said to my wife, \\"That was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time.\\" I watch about a movie a month. <br />  <br />A lot of the people in the first group tend to complain of  the movie's lack of plot. Many of these same people also claim that those of us who enjoyed this movie did so at Napoleon's expense- i.e. we laugh because we feel superior to him (see the above Amazon review.) I disagree with both notions. The plot certainly is simple and it's often obscured by the near continual stream of one-liners and gags. But there is a story here. It's about a nerdy kid and his nerdy friends who end up achieving more  than they  ever expected to and make themselves happy along the way.  <br /> <br />But few people, if any, are going around telling their friends to see this movie because of the great feel good story. Most people that enjoyed this film enjoyed it because they laughed so hard at all the gags and one-liners. I know I did.  <br /> <br />But I wasn't laughing because I felt superior to Napoleon and all the real life people he represents. I laughed because  I know, to a degree, what it's like to be Napoleon. I sat in class drawing \\"medieval warriors\\" and whatnot. I set up plywood ramps on the sidewalk in front of my house to ride my bike over. I remember regarding the popular girls as some sort of unattainable goddesses, and the dudes they hung around with as meathead jocks. I'm not alone here, and I'm not trying to portray myself as part of some sort of nerd elite. Most people can relate to what I'm talking about. Yeah, the character of Napoleon took the whole idea to an extreme. But would the movie have been funny if it didn't? Of course not.  <br /> <br />So if you haven't seen this movie and you're wondering whether you'll like it, be aware that the humor is simple and the story is simpler. And don't feel guilty for laughing at Napoleon. Odds are you or someone you know probably have a little in common with him. That's why I found it so fun to watch.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Oh dear. It's absolutely guaranteed that SOME part of \\"Team America\\" is going to offend you. However, even that part will make you laugh. And the parts that don't offend you will nearly kill you. <br /> <br />I still can't believe how hard I laughed at this movie. I missed huge chunks of it, as I tried to get myself under control. This is EASILY the funniest movie I've seen in the last 10 years. The only movies that I can think of that hold a candle to it are \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and \\"Blazing Saddles\\". <br /> <br />If you're easily offended, don't even bother. You may spontaneously combust. It's that bad. <br /> <br />If you can take this in the spirit it was intended (stupid, gross, offensive humor for it's own sake), take a deep breath, don't try to eat or drink while watching, and have at it. You will not regret it!
0684847248|5.0|My husband and I read this book together.  We had great conversations. The part that really shocked us was the part about love and unconditional love.  I always wondered how someone could say they were \\"In love at first sight\\" when all I ever felt at first sight was simply lust.  My veiws on emotional behavior seem justified now. Thanks
B00065JTBA|5.0|I must say, when I heard about this box set I was both elated and skeptical at the same time.  I couldn't wait for it to arrive, but I was worried it would be a flop.  I was VERY happily surprised.  This box set was much more than I was expecting and well worth the money spet!  It contains many, many songs that could have been hits and are now certainly favorites of mine!<br /><br />This box set is an excellent compilation of the many \\"faces\\" and sounds/phases of BJ.  As one reviewer put it, with certain songs it's quite easy to tell the period the song was written in- ie 80's vs. 90's.  Overall, the box set is quite up-beat and fun.  I actually even enjoy David's, Richies and Tico's songs.  Some favorite songs of mine: Why Aren't You Dead, Open all Night, I Get a Rush, Thief of Hearts, Edge of a Broken Heart, Lonely at the Top, Breathe, Love aint Nothin' but a 4 Letter Word, Crazy Love, Sympathy, Only in my Dreams & Fire Inside.<br /><br />The only thing that did disappoint me with this set was the DVD.  I think they should have included much more.  It would have been fun to see a few video's or further interviews- even some from the past.  What we got was a few thank you's and some explanations for the songs- which was great, but that was already included in the book that comes along with the set.  The book was nice...but the dvd seemed to just double the effort & be a repeat.  All in all though- I'd love to see Bon Jovi put out a set like this again in another 20 years!  Don't be afraid...give this a try!
0140283587|4.0|In the novel poverty is seen as a kind of annoyance that you have to ignore, otherwise your mind gets ill, because you cannot change the misery. Automatically, poverty evokers a bab conscience in the travellers and since they are not interested in India and its problems, but only in themselves, they stop thinking about India's poverty. The book's language is partly rather vulgar, but it is put in a kind of funny and original way that captivates the reader and makes him continue reading. The reader learns much information about informal language and juvenile language. <br /> <br />All in all, I personally liked to read the novel. It was great fun. A lot of times, i had to laugh because of the surprising language.
B00003OSTV|5.0|I first watched this movie about 20yrs ago, and I can still remember lines and images in this movie, despite not having watched it again for years. This is one of the most brilliantly created 1950's epic films.  <br /> <br />Nero's cynicism and hypocisy is brought out amazingly; Marcus, the true knight in shining armour, and Lygia a beauty and not \\"too narrow in the hips\\". The costumes are magnificent, the recreation of the coliseum spectacular.
B000002JNJ|5.0|This is the greatest Pantera album to ever come out, hands down.  It's one of my favorite metal albums ever. (Along with Metallica's Ride the Lightning, Black Label Society's Blessed Hellride, and Megadeth's Youthanasia)  The opening track, Cowboys From Hell is without a doubt my favorite song, a 10 outta 10.  Every track is worth your attention.  Phil Anselmo is at his best on Cowboys From Hell and just as good on Vulgar.  If you're a true metal head question this album, BUY BUY BUY!
B000002ITW|4.0|The major disappointment for me is the 1st 30 seconds of the cd which is actually the last 30 seconds of \\"Suite Judy Blue Eyes\\"....but other than that, this is an excellent live release with great music, nice harmony, and a bit of humor.  The addition of Neil Young provides some raw moments and he is truly one of the highlights on this cd.  Nothing else is missing here, you get the \\"live\\" performance as it is/was and you will enjoy it.
B000002AGM|3.0|Some very pleasing tones on this Miles Ahead release.  After three or four listens, some moments stand out more than others.  New Rhumba seems to stick in my ear the most.<br /><br />The overall sound has a more orchestral tone with more focus than later releases.  No song exceeds six minutes in length and the jams do not go off the deep end. That may be good or bad depending upon your tastes.  For me the experience just may need a little getting used to.  But no doubt about it, Miles sure was a talent.
B00005HYHG|4.0|Better sound quality would bring this rating up to 5 stars but it is live and the song selection just shows how multi talented this group really was.  Rocking from their roots and doing some Beatles songs, this is worth having for any Beatle fan or any rock fan in general.  Reminds me of a bootleg type of release and it is just a bit different from traditional releases by the Beatles.  That being said, you will enjoy it.
B000002UAC|3.0|This is a real early Beatles recording.  Half covers, half originals and half great and half nothing special.  I guess some the lyrics are too basic for me.  Songs like Hold Me Tight and I Wanna Be Your Man are oh so redundant.  Little Child and All I've Got To Do don't add much either.<br /><br />However, there are great moments.  All My Loving with the steady rhythm guitar, Devil In Her Heart, Money(great John vocals), and Till There Was You.  Whereas its hard to find really bad beatle music, the fab four would do better as time went on with Abbey Road, White Album, Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Magical Mystery Tour.
B000002H92|4.0|Nice to have all the live releases combined on one cd release.  The songs seem to flow together and the sound quality is really good.  Some highlights include \\"Back Door Man\\", \\"Gloria\\", and most of the popular Doors catalog of hit songs.  Jim sounds in true form and the band rocks and keeps the energy pumping throughout this release.  This will be one of your most often played cd's.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|OK, other reviewers have eruditely dissected the basic contrivances and joys or dissapointments found within, so I'll cut to the chase as this seems like a film you'll either find clever or absolutely loathe. Give yourself 1 point for every statement you agree with in the quiz below:    *I am often despondent over the happiness usually found in what  I consider contrived Hollywood endings. This is not because I'm dark or cynical, it's because I'm realistic.    *I like to be suprised, so much so that I'm willing to suspend all reason and logic as long as I'm caught off guard.    *House of 1,000 Corpses is an underrated and missunderstood film, I just wish it wasn't so mentally taxing.    *The Brad Pitt movie Se7en is desperately in need of an inferior gimmick ridden sequel and/or knockoff featuring poor acting and laughable dialogue. I hope somebody fills that void.    *I like to sit alone in my room and angrily stew about the possibility that people I don't know may or may not be be wasting their lives. I know being judgemental is wrong, but trust me, I have worse habits. The only thing that bothers me is that no one else seems to be able to relate to this strange obsession.    *My guilty pleasures are mens bathrooms, strange masks, looking at people who are chained up and ogling Danny Glover as he mails in his performance in yet another cop role. If only someone could combine all those themes. That would take a genius though...        If you agreed with all six of these statements, then congratulations, you're most likely insane. Purchase this movie immediately. Watch it daily and your life will suddenly take on previously unseen meaning. If you agreed with five or less of these statements, you will most likely find this movie either repulsive, boring, comical, or just plain idiotic. The fact that you actually worked hard and traded your money for the ability to view this will slowly gnaw away at any kind of happiness you may have felt earlier in the day. You may feel as if you were flim-flammed and duped. Choose wisely.
B000000W5F|4.0|Probably the last great Rolling Stones release.  Although \\"Start Me Up\\" has become a concert regular, \\"Waiting On A Friend\\", \\"Little T and A\\", and \\"Hang Fire\\" are all great songs and carry this release.  Compared with everything else that has come out from the Stones since 1980, this is still one of my favorite Stones cd's.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson has done his work well. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is one of the best portrayals of Christ's final days ever.    He has accurately transfered the story in the four gospels and added his own imagination into the mix.    Some of the movie's critics will tell you that since Mel Gibson has added his own color in the story that the movie is unfaithful to the Gospels. This is crazy. Nowhere does Mel's additions controdict the Bible, so therefore the movie is accurate.    This movie shows, I'm sure, just a glimpse of what Christ went through to save us from our sins. Though carrying our sins, I would say that he went through much more pain than the movie portrays.     This movie is inspirational, and after I saw it, I told myself never to take for granted what Christ did for me.     Many critics of this movie that I heard try to paint this movie has having a terrible affect on its viewers. Let me tell you this, I heard a story of a bank rober who went to see it, and after that, he returned the money to the bank and turned himself in.    Well done Mel!
0670033375|3.0|It is hard to believe that the author of the wonderfully entertaining and enlightening \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" penned this book.  While I admire his erudition and share his concerns regarding the environment, this book doesn't deliver what it promises to its readers.  It starts with the title itself as the book concentrates on environmental factors while either ignoring or skimping on other factors involved in societal collapse.  Next, he weakens the case he makes for the importance of environmental factors by relying upon examples based upon small, isolated and technologically primitive societies.  For example, the loss of the forests in Greenland may have destroyed the Norse settlements there.  However, the same situation in Britain resulted in the industrial revolution when coal replaced wood as the source of energy.  Lastly, this book bears the marks of being rushed too quickly to print without the services of a competent editor.  Unlike \\"GG&S\\", much of the book could be cut without doing harm to the author's thesis and in fact this would make it more accessible to the general public.
0671015206|3.0|I travel a great deal as an academician, and am constantly fascinated by the choices of books that are to be found at airport bookstores.  Of course, these sell mostly magazines, but always there are a selection of what I understand are known in the West as  \\"self-help management books\\" by wealthy bourgeois business men who are either nefarious corporate leaders or so-called self-made \\"entrepreneurs.\\"  These books beckon to grey-suited passers-by like Odysseyan Sirens, \\"Buy me, and you too can be an obscenely wealthy exploiter of the working class\\" or \\"Buy me, and you too can be a greedy Kulak leech without contributing a kopeck of labour value!\\"  These books seemingly do very well, especially judging their inflated price.<br /><br />So it is with this text, \\"The Millionaire Next Door.\\"  Given the present exuberant and wasteful excess of the Western consumer markets, this book appears at first glance to swim against the river by counseling the reader to save and live within means, an old fashion idea not inconsistent with S. N. Narpov's influential text, \\"Pig Iron Production in the Ural District Under the Fourth Five Year Plan.\\"  This book directly lead to the creation of the impeccable modern Soviet pension program for iron workers which was, tragically, allowed to be case aside by the Menshevik roader Gorbachev.  But I digress...<br /><br />The error of \\"Millionaire\\" is, like most books of its ilk, it refuses all recognition of the class problem.  You Americans are absorbed with the great capitalist myth, \\"Every man a king.\\"  You seem to believe that by dint of hard work and thrift, the golden road is open to anyone for entry into the exalted money class.  An example should suffice.  Several years ago I attended a conference in your Dallas, Texas, sponsored by a local college and entitled, \\"Marxian Inerrancy - Problem or Panacea?\\"  I was invited by several colleagues to attend - what you call it - a cowboy bar.  We began there a lively discussion of class-consciousness among the American working class.<br /><br />To prove a point, I approached a large gentleman standing near a pool table, who was large (almost two meters, and over 110 kilograms), with a beard, long hair and some tattoos including an American flag.  To me, there was no question as to his class.  I told him, \\"You, sir, are clearly a Peasant.  Why do you and your friends not identify with the interests of the Peasant class?\\"  Unfortunately, he indicated he was unwilling to engage in an academic discussion of this important question, instead threatening me with a pool cue while suggesting that either I perform unnatural acts with relatives, or that I was the product of one.  My friends quickly hustled me away from the establishment and cautioned me against unauthorized and unchaparoned  discussions with ordinary American workers...<br /><br />The mind set of American peasants and workers is indeed hard to penetrate. So too, the attraction of such illusory fluff as \\"Millionaire\\" and its fetishist devotion to a gospel of moral wealth.  While you are pinching pennies, corporate giants are looting your labour value.  Save, and the banks earn interest off the sweat of your hard work. These ideas were false in 1905 when enunciated by aristocratic apologists such as the railroad theoretician Sporov, and are just as false today.  Do not be deceived.  This is the false path to workers paradise.-consciousness among the American working class. <br /> <br />To prove a point, I approached a large gentleman standing near a pool table, who was large (almost two meters, and over 110 kilograms), with a beard, long hair and some tattoos including an American flag.

Why do you and your friends not identify with the interests of the Peasant class?\\"   Unfortunately, he indicated he was unwilling to engage in an academic discussion of this important question, instead threatening me with a pool cue while suggesting that either I perform unnatural acts with relatives, or that I was the product of one.  My friends quickly hustled me away from the establishment and cautioned me against unauthorized and unchaparoned  discussions with ordinary American workers... <br /> <br />The mind set of American peasants and workers is indeed hard to penetrate. So too, the attraction of such illusory fluff as \\"Millionaire\\" and its fetishist devotion to a gospel of moral wealth.  While you are pinching pennies, corporate giants are looting your labour value.  Save, and the banks earn interest off the sweat of your hard work. These ideas were false in 1905 when enunciated by aristocratic apologists such as the railroad theoretician Sporov, and are just as false today.  Do not be deceived.  This is the false path to workers paradise.
0843178434|2.0|In this book, the compulsively clean Little Miss Neat goes away on vacation. While she is gone, Mr. Muddle stops in for a visit and makes himself a cup of tea, inadvertently rearranging her kitchen in the process. When she returns, Little Miss Neat is exasperated to find everything in the wrong place, and she talks to Mr. Muddle and figures out what happened.<br /><br />This is a straightforward, simple book that children should be able to follow and enjoy. The series is similar to the Sweet Pickles books, in that it revolves around characters who exhibit certain traits, but I think that the simpler illustrations in this series might fail to hold the interest of a child young enough to enjoy the story.<br /><br />You might buy a single book in this series to see if it clicks for your child, but I wouldn't go crazy on the investment unless it's something that he or she really enjoys. In my opinion, there are better books out there, whether you're looking for a book that's entertaining, informative, or morally instructive.
0061020710|3.0|I'm glad that I finally read this book, but I'm also glad that I did not read it first because I'm not so sure I'd have returned to Discworld. <br /> <br />As has been mentioned by other reviewers, this is really almost like three short stories and the first chapters of the second book.  I almost feel as if this book was written later just to introduce the discworld, but I don't think it was.  Death (the grim reaper) is very different than he was in the other books and I found this a bit disconcerting.  It is not the greatest of the discworld novels.  I also did not appreciate the \\"cliffhanger\\" ending which literally stopped in the middle of the story and continued to the second in Light Fantastic.   <br /> <br />Having said all that, I think that knowing ahead of time that these are really almost like introductory short stories for the Discworld and that they aren't the greatest, I'd still recommend reading them--atlhough, perhaps not for your first Discworld novel. <br /> <br />I've never been a fan of Rincewind the Magician, but I think this book (and Light Fantastic) helped me to appreciate him and the luggage more.  I never quite got the luggage.  I loved Twoflower and was a big fan of the Luggage.  Overall, a decent book as long as you are forewarned about certain aspects.
B00009W0U4|1.0|Definitely DO NOT buy this DVD! It's total CRAP! ( RUBBISH ).  The whole story goes backwards from the beginning of the DVD. ie: It opens at the \\"Ending\\" of the story and as the DVD progresses forward normally, the scenes go backwards!! There is a horrific, graphic 20 minute rape scene in the story, where a very beautiful young woman is raped ( doggy style ) in the subway. It's quite violent too! Give it a miss! A Sick French Film! A French Turd! That's what you get when you buy this DVD!
0061020680|3.0|I thought that this book was pretty decent.  It doesn't have the depth that I like in later novels, but it is only the fourth one.  There really isn't too much to say about it.  It was a decent read, nothing spectacular, but fun, funny, and interesting.  I recommend it as a lighter read in the discworld novels.  I do think that it develops Death's character pretty nicely.  Since Death is in just about all, if not every, discworld novel, it helps with some quips and jokes that come in later books.  Gives you sort of a nice, warm \\"I got the inside joke\\" feel later on in the series.

B00005LC1H|5.0|I first found Fawlty Towers while in high school on my local PBS station.  Years later I bought the collection on VHS and I'll occasionally pull one out and watch it.  Some of the episodes are just as funny today as they were 25+ years ago.  If it wasn't for some vet bills right now, I'd probably run out and get these on DVD for the better quality and the hope of some good extras. <br /> <br />What makes Fawlty Tower's work is Basil's arrogance, his fear/contempt/love of his wife, and his ability to always do the wrong thing even when he is trying to do the right thing.  My favorite episode is the one where the guy sneaks the girl into his room.  The image of Basil tapping on the glass as if he is inspecting it is pure comic genius. <br /> <br />I was sorely disappointed with the American version a few years ago with John Laroquette.  They tried to portray the Fawlty's marriage as being loving, where is the fun in that?  The remake lacked any of the edginess of the original. <br /> <br />Overall, Fawlty Towers was simply one of the funniest shows ever.  It's a shame they didn't make more. <br />
B0000AI44Q|4.0|You gotta give Neil respect.  How many 1960's rockers, nearing their 60th birthday, are churning out concept albums with bonus DVD's and taking a full-fledged rock concert/drama theatre on the road?  It's pretty incredible.  And while the stuff of 'Greendale' isn't in the same class as some of Neil's finer works, it finds its own niche and makes its own unique contribution to an amazing catalog.  <br /> <br />I know Neil is telling a story in 'Greendale', but I really don't find the story all that intriguing.  What I do find intriguing is how individual snippits relate to Neil's life, pursuits, and philosophies.  Neil has at times been vocal in attempting to distance himself from his 'hippie origins', yet like much of his work 'Greendale' only finds him more deeply wedded to those persistant roots.  Verses from songs like the opener, 'falling from above' (\\"A little love and affection will make the world a better place\\"), the second track, 'double e' (\\"Grandma's okay... she's livin' in the summer of love\\"), the third track, 'devil's sidewalk' (\\"one thing I can tell you is you got to be free, John Lennon said that\\"), the sixth track, 'bandit' (\\"you're invisible, you got too many secrets, Bob Dylan said that\\"), and the closer, 'be the rain' (\\"save the planet for another day\\"), only crispen our notion of where Neil's head is at, and has always been: the 1960's. <br /> <br />I also love those references seemingly drawn from Neil's own life, such as \\"change comes slow in the country, when you're new there's lots of distrust\\" recalling Young's years establishing a life in California, and California adjusting to Neil.  \\"Dusty white El Dorado cruisin' through the trees\\" harkens to Young's lifelong love for cars, especially tanks like Hearst's and Caddy's.  Then there's all those verses that just ring true with Neil's wry sense of wit, such as \\"Grandpa said to cousin Jed... \\"I won't retire but I might retread\\", or \\"Hey, Mr. Clean, you're dirty now, too\\", and \\"Grandpa died like a hero, fighting for freedom of silence\\".  Young reels off one great line after another in what may be one of his most lyrically accomplished works, even if the overall storyline spins its tires too frequently. <br /> <br />The music on 'Greendale' is less exploratory and varied than previous Neil albums, relying heavily on bass-laden guitar riffs.  His guitar work has a 'big' sound, as many tracks from his previous release 'Are You Passionate?' delivered.  Despite the presence of Crazy Horse as his backing band, nearly every song is a mid-tempo affair with little of the hard-driving, squelching feedback characteristic of Neil's typical work with Crazy Horse.  Several of the lead guitar riffs are, however,  quite catchy and serve as sturdy foundations for the band to build upon, but it also renders some songs, such as 'carmichael' and 'bringing down dinner' less distinguishable.  That fate won't befall 'bandit', which is the only acoustic track in the set.  'falling from above', 'devil's sidewalk', and 'be the rain' possess memorable melodies that will stand out among Neil's best work.  Other mysteries remain, such as why Neil seems to have a recurring aversion to capital letters (a trait that also reared it's head on the 're.ac.tor' album in the early 1980's), and the curious 'weed-like' aroma tinging the off-color (recycled?) paper the booklet is printed on. <br /> <br />There are extensive liner notes written by Neil, composed in a 'stream-of-consciousness' mode which give us further insights into the storyline blending together the 'Greendale' songs, and offering even deeper revelations into Neil's own psyche between the lines.  There is a great deal to like about Greendale, and Neil clearly held nothing back in his efforts to make this project stand out in his already imposing legacy.  Kinda' makes you wonder what he'll be doing for his next encore.
B0006OBPTA|4.0|I absolutely love the Karate kid trilogy. It's actually what got me into martial arts in the first place. 1, 2, and 3 are pure heart and brilliance in my opinion. The beggining, the journey and the return. Part 2 is my favorite simply because its the only one I owned as a child which I recorded off of TV during Hurricane Hugo in th 80's. Which is quite Ironic if youve seen the second part. Now that the movies are DVD we can all enjoy the great movies of our younger years, as well as extra features whcih I couldnt believe. Anyway, I recomend the box set to anyone any fan of any of the movies, save the 4th. (movie which does not count).
B000001EGE|4.0|Elton was still hanging on to his \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" influences while being tugged ever so steadily into the \\"pop\\" realm when he made this album.  Years later it appears to be holding up quite well.  Two big hits come from this collection and one that really should have been.  \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" is one of his best tunes ever and that song alone makes this well worth having.  \\"Susie\\" is a great rocker, as well.  Not every song is a gem but those that qualify for that category fail to drag this album down the way some of his \\"fillers\\" did on subsequent offerings.
B000002JSP|3.0|In The Evening is one of the all-time great songs, and I adore Fool In The Rain. South Bound Suarez is fun, and All My Love might not be 'typical Led Zep' but it's very pretty and surely heartfelt.  <br /> <br />And I love the *idea* of Carouselambra. But Carouselambra is their greatest weakness taken to its logical extreme. That weakness can be illustrated by my favorite Zeppelin joke: <br /> <br />\\"I heard this great new Led Zep song yesterday.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Oh yeah, what's it called?\\" <br /> <br />\\"Side One!\\" <br /> <br />There are so many great things about this band, and this album. Until their complete lack of any kind of self-editing ability tripped them up, as it did so often. They never learned the difference between an 8-minute song that *needs* to be that long (Stairway) and an eleven-minute song that should've been trimmed to five (Carouselambra). It's not as bloody interminable as In My Time Of Dying (this is the song that never ends, it just goes on and on my friend), but it's close. <br /> <br />But, then again, there's In The Evening. Man, I love, love, love that song. Sends chills up my spine every time. And it's just as long as it had to be.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|This is a great ADULT album and it deserves the Grammy.  Sympathy vote or not, this is a fine goodbye from one of the very best in music.  The arrangements and the production are as good as it gets and the vocal performances are first rate.  I read reviews saying that Ray's voice sounded weak but I don't agree.  He still hit the high notes as well as anybody and his playfulness and emotions ring through.  The only shame is that you have to wait until the last cut to hear his great duet with Van Morrisson.  The younger generation may not have much appreciation for this kind of music but I'm glad that those who understand the artistry involved in this kind of endeavor voted with their hearts and ears and put it on the pedestal it deserves.
0385510454|3.0|So you've read this is Grisham's return to legal thrillers after inexplicable diversions like Bleachers. Hate to tell you - it's anything but.<br /><br />We shoot off the docks with grand Hollywood-style razzmatazz involving the CIA, the president of United States, and the dubious pardon of a certain high-stakes deal agent sent to Europe as a sitting duck for assassins to get him. Makes you buckle up for some breathless action.<br /><br />Then just a few dozen pages later this whole sensational setup goes thud as our protagonist (and Grisham) get smitten with Italiana. We take long languid walks through Bologna's porticoed sidewalks and piazzas. Read ornate descriptions of the city's basilicas, towers, frescoes, marble crypts. There's even time to learn the legend surrounding the naked bronze statue of the Roman god Neptune at the Fontana del Nettuno from the 1500s.<br /><br />Our little broker is savoring the food, the language, the history. Problem is, we're not because nothing's happening.<br /><br />As a storyteller Grisham is in full bloom, which would've been super if only he had a story to tell. Recommended for italophiles, rest of us should seek our thrills elsewhere.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Please ignore John q. Public's review, as he obviously hasn't seen this film.  Glancing at his other, mostly negative reviews, he reviews things like Brittney Spears biography, which he obviously didn't read, but just wanted to post a negative review to be a jerk.  This is Hayao Miyazaki's second film, and the first one he really wrote with his own character designs.  It is one of my favorite films of all time and is based on his long running manga (which seriously expands the story, in case you are interested).  Yes, it is not like Loony Tunes, but rather a mix of Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings.  It is not to be confused with typical Japanese anime, though.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Animation fans rejoice!   <br /> <br />     Apart from \\"Nausica of the Valley of Wind\\", \\"Porco Rosso\\" is simply one of the most entertaining, fascinating and beautiful Studio Ghibli films ever.  A prime example of the kind of film you'll never see come out of an American studio, it's simply too different, too hard to define, it doesn't fit nicely into a genre niche.  But that's what makes it so great.   <br /> <br />     Action, humor, a flying ace that just happens to be a pig and a surprisingly touching romantic subplot... who could ask for more.  You?  Well what about fantastic animation, awe inspiring hand animated aerial dog fights and \\"vicious\\" air pirates?   <br /> <br />     If you're a fan of animated films or of Studio Ghibli, or if you simply enjoy great film, you owe it to yourself to see Porco Rosso.   <br />
B00006LI4S|3.0|There are probably more Elvis sightings per year than Dave Gilmour sightings ever since Pink Floyd finally disbanded, so this 2002 concert is a welcome addition to most Floyd fans' libraries. It's far from perfect, but it definitely has some good moments, and shows Gilmour taking some real chances. There's no getting around the fact that Gilmour's capable of saying more with a bent note than most lead guitarist can accomplish with ultrafast picking and grandstanding.    On the positive side are Gilmour's new arrangements of old Floyd songs. Drawing heavily on lesser known songs from \\"The Division Bell,\\" Gilmour treats most of the material to acoustic instruments such as cello, upright bass, classical guitar, etc. He seems to want to recast this material as chamber pop, and it works exceptionally well. Until the reprise of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" near the end, almost none of the material sounds as it did on old Floyd albums, and this is all for the better. At times, it reminded me of how Clapton updated his old electric blues roots on \\"Clapton Unplugged.\\" There are also some excellent bonuses worth seeking out, featuring Gilmour jamming away in various TV performances.    On the downside are the visuals. Yes, this is supposed to be a more intimate venue, rather than the multimedia bombast Floyd perfected. But Gilmour looks scruffy, and much of the concert has a \\"filmed for PBS\\" quality about it. Sections of the show, particularly \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" come across as off-the-cuff rehearsals, and not a professional presentation.     Most Floyd fans, like myself, will enjoy huge sections of this DVD. Lukewarm fans should probably avoid this entirely.  Regardless, it's rather sad that this DVD represents the last we've heard from Gilmour in a long while.

B0002YLC24|5.0|This movie broke my heart in such a sweet and delicate way. It is the perfect resolution for a movie with characters that shaped so much of my romantic sensibilities growing up. For people of my generation, Before Sunrise was truly something memorable and it was a real fantasy (pardon the oxymoron, I can't think of a more fitting way to describe it). Every time I would watch this movie (Before Sunrise) I would be plagued by the ambiguous ending. I would attempt to reconcile it in a way that was not overly childish or optimistic and yet still hopeful. The sequel fulfilled all these expectations and more. Jesse and Celine are made real (flesh and blood) by these two wonderful actors. Because this movie takes place in real time (and even the time between the two movies take place in real time) you genuinely feel as if this is a wonderful story that you are hearing about from a dear old friend. Watch it if you liked the first, you will not be disappointed.
B00005NGZX|5.0|That's gotta be the case cause Jane Doe is brutally heavy and amellodically intense, making it easy to assume it's the mutant offspring of the above mentioned bands. If you're looking for the more whiny emo-hardcore stuff, you're gonna be sorely disappointed, this album's not for the timid, and is meant to be played as loud as possible without blowing out your speakers. A throaty scream in the midst of guitar riffs that sound like they're trying to tear down the studio brick by brick all backed by some of the tightest drumming on the hardcore scene. I find it imposible not to spaz out violently whenever \\"Homewrecker\\" comes on, probably my favorite track on  Jane Doe. Fast. Brutal. And never compromising, Jane Doe will leave you feeling like you just survived a war and desperately wanting to go through it all over again.
B00005U122|4.0|Almost no footage of Pink Floyd has been released on DVD, so this concert video featuring Floyd lyricist Roger Waters is especially welcome. Featuring an ace lineup of crack session musicians (most of whom work regularly with Eric Clapton), Waters serves up a generous slice of Floyd classics - including the bulk of the \\"Animals,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" albums, all performed with both passion and professionalism. Even Waters' solo material, which is preachy and one-dimensional by comparison, comes across as exciting.  <br /> <br />The result is amazing, and is only enhanced by the tasteful camerawork. Both previous Floyd concerts on VHS (\\"Pulse\\" and \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\") were hampered by kitchy, corny direction; this is a common flaw among concert films. \\"In the Flesh\\" avoids these problems, and holds up exceptionally well. Indeed, this might have been an even more enjoyable show on DVD rather than live, due to the great work by the camera crew. <br /> <br />This is one concert DVD I'm happy to watch in its entirety.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|I hated the spiderman sequel, ALL of the star wars sequels, and any other sequel you can name that I've seen, but this sequel I absolutely loved.  I felt it was even better that the first in that they actually did do some character development.   <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like was there was a lot more, well, shall we say \\"mushy\\" stuff.  (I hate movies with kissing.)  There was also a lot more violence and swearing than the first which is why I give it only 4 stars instead of 5.   <br /> <br />The ending was excellent even though sad.  It conveyed all of the emotion and shock we comic book readers had during the \\"Phoenix\\" saga of X-MEN.   <br /> <br />I hope they do go ahead and make a third one.  Man, I CANNOT believe I just said that.
B0001I55OC|2.0|Ok, I'll mention the few brief moments I actually enjoyed from this movie.  The time travel scenes were decent, but still boring.  There just wasn't enough energy in the movie, I just can't escape that.  Maybe it seemed like everyone was moving along at a half-hearted pace. <br /> <br />Ok, I have to say a good part, um...ok, when they fired that trebuchent (spelling, who knows), and it was a pretty neat visual of the first flaming fireball.  Then they fired back that \\"magical\\" greek fire arrow.  The commander guy goes \\"Oh my god,\\" and there's an ok scene of the catapult bursting into flames, and then he says \\"you are a magician!\\"  That was neato for about 1 minute and 3 seconds.  Then back to the same boring slow moving uninspired plodding story line.  Who cares if they get back, I was yawning. <br /> <br />They made one last decent philosophical point at the very end about how one makes his own destiny in history.  The message at first is impressive, but then it gets worse every moment you think about it.  Hmm, time travel back to the past, die of some horrible condition only found in the 1300's (whatever the date). <br />I'll bet that guy would've been there for like 1 year, and then died of some black plague or something.  I want to cry how unrealistic it is.  From having his ear chopped off itself would've probably killed him from infection, oh but it is all worth it for the lovely Mary Ann or whoever that was.  What about excessive bleeding?  Um, nah that doesn't happen in real life.  I hope the sex was good for the total of 2 days before he got beheaded for being a heretic. <br /> <br />Heartfelt until you remember the real world, and then you realize that everyone still walked around half-heartedly in the movie, but they wore such neat costumes!!  Stick to highlander, get the hell away from this retarded movie.  It was entertaining for about 5% of the time. <br /> <br />Maybe reading the book, I read it is based on, will erase this from my memory.  I hope awormhole forms and I can stop this movie from being produced so poorly.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I can't stand people not lovin' on this album or else they never even heard of the man that made it all happen. Ya'll should be ashamed. I mean this isn't a album you can't live without Ray put out a lot in his career before he passed. This is his first duets album along with friends and classmates who are dueting and collaborating on this album.  <br /> <br />I understand that Ray is no longer with us no more. But he lives on tho in our heart and souls. This took him home 8 Grammy's because of the success of this album and a special tribute to him. Yeah Jamie Foxx, Usher, Alicia Keys, Kanye West and others all pay their respects to him to those that seen the movie \\"Ray\\" would be excited and more happy. <br /> <br />I'd never had a problem with him putting out a lot of good stuff 'cuz he's has that kindred spirit in him y'know like Miles Davis had it all started playing jazz and reinventing the cool in his sound and how James Brown created the sounds of funk and blend it for most artists that does rap, R&B, jazz, neo-soul, and hip-hop. No doubt about it. <br /> <br />I luv Ray Charles as a person, a pioneer, a prophet, a hero, a legend, and especially a good mentor to me for what he does in the history of music. This would go on to my music collection in years to come. I'd appreciate of what he left us before he died and doesn't had to suffer no more but stay peacefully. <br /> <br />He's in heaven now with God and doesn't had to look back but be the man of who he is now. I pray that God would find a way in this man's legacy to come.  <br /> <br />Ok long period short, but once I heard the album I picked up from Circuit City yesterday I was so amazed that I purchased it just 6 months after it was released and 5 days after the Grammys. Isn't that amazing? I was so amazed that I got a change to see what it sounds without sounding too bad y'knowwhattamean.  <br /> <br />My most favorite song of all-time is \\"You Don't Know Me\\" feat. Diana Krall (who's also a pleasure towork on this album) has been played on the smooth jazz stations in Atlanta, GA y'know WJZZ 107.5. And I definitely liked it a lot 'cuz it reminds me I had to keep thinking about him every day and always remember 'cuz Ray is Gone But Not Forgotten or GBNF for short. <br /> <br />Especially some others I like are \\"Sorry To Be The Hardest Word\\" w/ Elton John, \\"Here We Go Again\\" w/ Norah Jones (I know it won a Grammy nomination for it), \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" w/ Gladys Knight (It was once done my man and idol Stevie Wonder of the compilation I had on tape entitled \\"Looking Back\\"), \\"Hey Girl\\" w/ my boy and labelmate Michael McDonald, there's a lot more I can't think right now but I luv every song that's on this CD. So an inspiration to me and especially my most fav. album to date. <br /> <br />Ray Charles aka The Genius of Soul, Brother Ray, Soul Man, etc. May your heart, your soul, your spirit and your music rest in peace. 'Cuz you live on in us Brother Ray we miss you dearly and we'll never forgot. You'll always be a part to me for now on in my heart.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I was laughing althroughout this movie, yet althroughout the whole movie, I was still asking myself: How could I be laughing at this (...)?    Yes, this is a very pointless movie, but it's got my vote for one of the best comedies of 2004.  Unlike other movies, the actors in here don't try to be funny; they naturally are.    Napoleon is a geek who gets slammed into lockers constantly, and who is a big fan of tetherball.  Along comes a newbie; Pedro Sanchez, who is also not so bright.  Alongside them, is a girl named Deb, who drinks 2% milk.  They make a team, and the movie shows you their adventures of Deb trying to be a photographer, Pedro trying to run for president, and Napoleon trying to dance.    On the other side, you have Napoleon's uncle who comes to visit, and Napoleon's brother, who meets a pretty black girl named LaFonDuh.      The movie travels constantly from the stories about Napoleon and his friends, to his brother and uncle.  Watch this movie and you'll be laughing constantly.      P.S. Try not to stare at Napoleon's teeth; I almost threw-up doing it...
6304779356|4.0|\\"The Lost Boys\\" combines horror and comedy in a fun vampire flick. Recently divorced Lucy (Diane Wiest) and her two teenaged sons, Michael (Jason Patric) and Sam (Corey Haim), have just moved to Santa Clara, a beach town and reputed \\"murder to capitol of the world\\", to live with with Lucy's eccentric father (Barnard Hughes). Michael immediately becomes infatuated with Star (Jami Gertz), a mysterious young woman who frequents the town's bustling boardwalk with a group of ruffians, led by the charismatic David (Kiefer Sutherland). Michael allows himself to be seduced into this pack of predators by his desire for Star, but the gang turns out to be more than run-of-the-mill troublemakers. They are vampires, and Michael is quickly becoming one too. Michael's younger brother Sam enlists the help of two bumbling young vampire hunters, the Frog brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander), to stake the head vampire and save Michael and the other half-vampires from an eternity of undead existence.<br /><br />It goes without saying that none of the characters in this film, except perhaps Diane Wiest's fairly levelheaded \\"mom\\", acts as a real person would under these circumstances. That can cause some eye-rolling, but both comedy and horror genres frequently require preposterous behavior, and this is basically entertaining. The vampires are hideous and blood-thirsty. The Frog brothers provide sophomoric comic relief. And, in the tradition of many vampire stories before it, Michael and Star must choose between normal human existence and a life of eternal youth and constant predation. I'm not sure what to make of the Rob Lowe beefcake poster in Sam's room, and some of the film's many cheesy lines fall flat, but \\"The Lost Boys\\" is a fun, unapologetically over-the-top, teen vampire romp.
B00004VVND|4.0|\\"Boy, have we got a vacation for you...where nothing can go wrong!\\"<br /><br />Well, as the old saying goes...\\"famous last words.\\"<br /><br />\\"Westworld\\" is supposed to be set in the future (as visualized back in 1973 when the film was made, apparently the computers of the future are really, really big, and the monitors are really, really small, lol), where pampered rich folk can go to a vacation resort named \\"Delos\\", and may choose one of three \\"worlds\\" to visit and play make-believe-for-grownups in: Medievalworld, Romanworld, and Westworld. Our protagonists John Blaine and Peter Martin (played by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin, respectively) choose Westworld. John is a Westworld veteran, having visited many times. Peter is his friend and first-timer at the resort; uttering childlike statements such as \\"Do we get a real gun? Wow!\\" In the various \\"worlds\\", the guests interact with each other and with anatomically-correct, extremely realistic robots. They are able to *ahem* interact very closely with the female robots, and also shoot the gunslinger robots for fun if they wish (the guns they are supplied with will not work on real people). Romanworld is promoted as something of a sex resort, and Medievalworld seems geared towards the romantics.<br /><br />The film begins with quite a lot of intentional comedy and satire, and starts out very much like it could have been a 1970's TV \\"Movie of the Week\\", but once the robots start to \\"crash\\"...the rest of the film is a truly creepy western/sci-fi film. It's a gunfight, a western, albeit a Sci-Fi one. The last half-hour of the film is essentially a silent movie, as Crichton said he wanted, save for the great soundtrack, which sounds something like a bow being drawn against piano strings, or a cello; anyway it has the same unsettling effect as the out-of-tune piano in another favorite of mine, \\"Wait Until Dark\\" (1967).<br /><br />Movies with robots/androids...there have been many I have seen and loved. But examples of what I consider to be frightening robots in film, besides \\"Westworld\\", are: \\"The Stepford Wives\\" (1974), \\"Alien\\" (1979), \\"Blade Runner\\" (1982), \\"The Terminator\\" (1984), \\"Aliens\\" (1986), and \\"The Companion\\" (1995).<br /><br />\\"Westworld\\" was the first scary robot film I ever saw. And even after the others that followed, nothing quite equals Yul Brynner in his role as the robot gunslinger gone bad in \\"Westworld.\\" His performance is what really makes the movie; Brynner was a good actor, and even (maybe especially) playing a machine, his skill is used to great effect. His performance is anything but wooden, unlike the always-stilted Ah-nold in \\"The Terminator\\", for instance. When Brynner's robot gunslinger commands \\"Draw\\", with the slightest twist at the corner of his mouth, he is completely creepy and scary. Even the way he walks and moves has an element to it that is hard to define, and very unnerving. When Peter first meets him at the saloon, it's obvious that the robot gunslinger's movements are very fluid, in a way one doesn't usually see an actor portray a robot, yet the smooth mannerisms somehow serve to further the effect.<br /><br />What's also great about this film is the evolving of the Peter Martin character. He starts out as the inexperienced nerdy sidekick to Brolin's John Blaine, and ends up showing his true mettle as the going gets rough. The formerly milquetoast Peter quickly learns how to survive and fight back, and Richard Benjamin is very sympathetic, likeable, and effective in his portrayal.<br /><br />This was Sci-Fi writer/director Michael Crichton's first foray into big-screen filmmaking. Crichton has said he made the film in thirty days, under schedule and within the budget. I would expect that finding pre-made sets was fairly easy; there was bound to be at least one western set sitting around the studio lots. In fact, several locations were utilized for the filming of Westworld: the Mojave Desert, part of the gardens of the Harold Lloyd Estate, and various available studio stages.<br /><br />If you find a DVD of this to rent, and you've never seen the film before, I recommend that you do not watch the trailer first! It's a real spoiler.<br /><br />Note: Look for Majel Barrett (of \\"Star Trek-Generations\\", and she is also Gene Roddenberrys' widow) as the whorehouse madam.<br /><br />Brynner's part was a play on his role in the classic western film \\"The Magnificent Seven.\\"VD of this to rent, and you've never seen the film before, I recommend that you do not watch the trailer first!

0767819543|5.0|The transforming and redemptive power of forgiveness is the major theme in this moving film from Brazil. The two leads, Dora, an older woman whose self-imposed sheltered life has been long shut-off from the yearnings and longings that make us human, and Josue, a young boy who forces her to confront her detachment as such, move the viewer from a jolting start to a warm, satisfying ending.  <br /> <br />This is a film I never get tired of. The performances are great; the musical score is subtle, yet significant; the people and places are compelling; and the story, although perhaps somewhat manipulative, is overall enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Some reviewers have side-stepped the warmth of this movie in attacking it as pretentious, cliche, and overtly sentimental. Although these are valid arguments, I felt that overall these points are forgiveable and easy to overlook.    <br />
B00002E233|3.0|...though the special effects (the data-animation of the sharks) could have been better at certain \\"events\\" of the movie. The acting is ok, the story (unrealistic of course) is rather exiting, the plot really works -and all in all the movie is absolutely recommended if you are able to watch a modern \\"Jaws\\", and see a little between the fingers. Far from a classic, but watchable! <br /> <br />(The sharks are rather impressive too where the \\"real ones\\" are used, they look fast and dangerous -and the movie works this way as rather \\"creepy\\" now and then, some highlights of the movie are a bit predictable perhaps, but they work for sure. The best shark-movie since \\"Jaws\\", but not as remembarable).
B000001DZQ|4.0|A tribute to one of the great bluesmen of all time! I had always heard of Roy Buchanan but this was the first time I sat down and actually listened. Even though some of the vocals are a little uneven there are things on this collection you won't here the likes of from anyone else.
B0006MT314|5.0|What can i say. A great album. it definetely gives you a feel for the show. However, it didn't include 3 great songs from the show. <br />1. \\"Run\\"-Snow Patrol-at the end of season one's finale. <br />2. \\"Echo\\"-Vertical Horizon-episode 2'the places you have come to fear the most'. <br />3. \\"Whatcha Gonna Do?\\"-Sprung Monkey-Episode 4 'Crash Into You'. <br /> Although these great songs are not on the soundtrack it doesn't stop it from being a great soundtrack. <br />\\"The Good Kind\\" by The Wreckers is one of the best songs on the album along with \\"Mix Tape\\" and \\"Sidewalks\\". The worst song on the album has to be \\"Glad\\" by Tyler Hilton. I have to say he is one of the worst singers in the world, he's acting not very good either. <br />    Though the Album is not as good as it could have been it's still a must buy. If you love this soundtrack check out the OC soundtrack Mix 1.

B0002NRRAG|2.0|Let me just state up front that I adore Billie Holiday.  And it's likely that if you feel about Billie Holiday the way I do, you'll hate this CD.  But most people don't listen to Billie Holiday and maybe have never even heard her.  For those people, how are they supposed to know that this is just pure mimicry?  Put a gardenia in her hair and watch her go.<br /><br />But let's put this CD in perspective.  Imagine there was an excellent Elvis imitator out there who put together an album of new music.  The music was OK, nothing special, done primarily in 50s rock and roll style.  Would anybody listen to such a thing?  Would it be played on AAA radio incessantly?  The answer is a resounding no.<br /><br />Ms. Peyroux benefits from the fact that it's been 60 years since Billie Holiday was popular.  People have forgotten her.  So when a Billie Holiday imitator comes along it sounds fresh to their ears.  But it isn't fresh.<br /><br />I have a lot of Billie Holiday music in my collection.  I don't need to add a Billie Holiday imitator CD to it.  This CD is a case of a record company callously trying to cash in on the Norah Jones phenomenon by finding a sweet unoriginal pleasant voice to sing middle of the road music.  Then you bring in Larry Klein, who understands perfectly how to produce a derivative sell out album like this - bring in some predictable nostalgia driven arrangements - and you have a piece of stale candy on your hands.  It isn't at all close to the real deal.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Although the merger between early 20th century theater and alternative rock has produced some interesting experiments (The Real Tuesday Weld, Yo La Tengo, Dresden Dolls), few albums appeal to the intellectual and popular sensibilites as The Arcade Fire's Funeral does.  The album entertains and intrigues on so many different levels that it requires multiple listens to truly appreciate the depth of the songwriting and the uniqueness of the melodies.  But what truly sets this apart from other brilliant and complex albums like Radiohead's OK Computer, is the fact that it's so incredibly catchy.   <br /> <br />Because of the complexity of the songs, it's impossible to describe how they sound.  Like Radiohead's Paranoid Android, each song evolves and shifts.  The instrumentation is endless (most band members play at least three instruments) and the lyrics are the most poetic and intelligent lyrics I've ever heard.  Most of all, the songs stand on their own and work incredibly well as an album.   <br /> <br />With a title like Funeral, it's easy to expect a slow, sad and remorseful album.  On the contrary, Funeral celebrates the fleeting wonders of life and love with a sound that's equally intense and organic.  I'm not an emotional person, but it's hard not to swoon as you listen to this album. <br /> <br />In a world of bland-corporate radio, intelligent bands often get pushed to the margin. In Funeral, however, we find a successful bridge between the intelligence of indie-rock and the catchiness of pop.  It's definately great to hear the album's songs already recieving airplay.
0385510454|2.0|Good start, but bad finish.  I liked the way infused Italian culture into the setting, but not enough suspense!  Bad finish...unless he is taking lessons from Daniel Silva and coming back to write a sequel, this book needs work!  His editor must have been out to lunch on the end of this one! Such a shame...because the plot was so good.
B00005JMXX|3.0|It wasn't really a good movie. All is has is a buch of shot of weather disaster made by computers. but had some good actions scenes.
B0000CE742|5.0|The queen of extravaganza and spectacular comebacks sums up on album \\"The Very Best Of\\" astonishing forty years of her career, which brought unforgettable worldwide hits in as many as five decades! No other star achieved this status as a solo artist.    This is a full two-CD version of this compilation with 42 songs - almost all her European & US hits from all labels she recorded for and some rarities as well. Fans can also find here all 5 US Top 10 hits recorded in duo Sonny & Cher, what is brilliant completion of this collection.    It's an almost excellent compilation. Almost, because it should contain all Cher's (also recorded with Sonny) Top 20 hits from the charts in the USA (Hot 100 and Singles Sales from \\"Billboard\\") and in the UK. Unfortunately her record company decided to put some less successful songs. It means that songs: \\"Train Of Thought\\", \\"Save Up All Your Tears\\", \\"Not Enough Love In The World\\", \\"Alive Again\\" or even not released as singles \\"Bang Bang\\" in new version and \\"Love Hurts\\" should be replaced by: \\"You Better Sit Down Kid\\", \\"Love One Another\\" and recorded with Sonny \\"Just You\\", \\"But You're Mine\\", \\"What Now My Love\\" and \\"Little Man\\". Anyway, it's still excellent compilation, because all Cher's songs are great.    And the real treasures for every fan are rare songs: \\"Bad Love\\" from the 1980 movie \\"Foxes\\" with Jodie Foster, \\"Rudy\\" from underrated 1982 album \\"I Paralyze\\", a charity 1993 UK #1 single \\"Love Can Build A Bridge\\" recorded with Chrissie Hynde, Neneh Cherry and Eric Clapton, \\"Born With The Hunger\\" from unique 2000 album \\"not.commercial\\" and a 2001 duet with Eros Ramazzotti \\"Piu che puoi\\". Adding these rarities was much better idea than recording brand new songs.    Cher has released so many collections of hits so far that her every fan should be very exacting in selecting the best one. \\"The Very Best Of\\" is the most perfect, because it sums up forty years of her career. Of course, it's better to choose its comprehensive double CD version with 42 songs. But if you want to have only the most important hits of Cher, you can choose one-CD US version of this title or its special two-CD edition with bonus live disc from her farewell tour, to have these hits in both studio and live versions. It's a music feast for every fan of pop music. That's why Cher is so much successful artist so long. Let's enjoy!

B0007TKNL0|5.0|If you try, repeat, TRY, you MAY be able to spot a flaw or two in this movie. But why would you try?  From the opening scenes to the final credits, one is swept up in the awesome beauty of this film.  Just wait for the rendition of \\"All I Ask of You\\" on the roof of L'Opra Populaire in the midst of a gentle snowfall.  The fact that such a work of art will be sitting in my collection by mid-May (for $20.97!) will only make the rest of February, March and April seem that much longer!  The Broadway to Hollywood transformation has never been made so successfully.  Treat yourself to this fine film.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|This time, The Phantom Of The Opera is a musical formed by the forces of both Andrew Llyod Webber and Joel Schumacher of all people. Last time anyone made Phantom Of The Opera it was a dreadful horror movie with Robert Englund. Some people loved this, thats why its up for Best Picture (Comedy or Musical) and who can blame them...the production looks fabulous...there's some wonderful actors but do we really see them act? No we see them threwout the movie moan and groan out their feelings in high and low pitched musical numbers throwing out the dialouge. At least give us Grease or The Imposters..I mean, it was like Moulin Rouge over again..it would never end. Gerard Butler's (Timeline, Reign Of Fire) Phantom wasnt that impressive...he did a much better job as Dracula. Emily Rossum is beautiful and has a nice singing voice but enough already!!! Miranda Richardson's (Spider, Sleepy Hollow) singing voice is piercingly awful and Minnie Driver (Circle Of Friends, Beautiful) is so annoying...its hard to like anyone in this movie...although I was rooting for The Phantom to kill pretty rich boy who rides white horse and weaps cuz he cant have the woman he loves. Too much drivel in my mind.....wasnt the best in my mind. I just didnt get into it that much and for me it was boring,
006092988X|5.0|At first this book seems a little slow, but once you read into the second chapter you are mezmorized. I love this book so much, and i think it is a must read for everyone out there. This book is about a young girl who you see grow up throughout the book. She overcomes difficult times in her life with her family. This book is in a way inspirational. I have recommended this book to soo many people and they all have loved it, from male to female, and everyone else inbetween. Read this book, trust me, you wont regret it!
B000002N2P|5.0|This is like their Sophomore Album on a major record album. What can I say its a good cd. I really like the whole cd art aswell, it really blends in with the songs in here. Again a great cd to pick up in your nearest stores. Well since your here why not buy it in AMAZON.COM?  <br /> <br />
B00008DDSC|5.0|The personal and political comes together in a mesh of beauty, tenderness, honesty and desire in this stunner of a film.  Honest love stories, honest stories about anything, are rare hollywood product and this story pulls no punches.  Yet,  while the basis of the relationship of the two main characters, played by Spader and Gyllenhal, is a half reluctant half exuberant pull towards s/m/b/d, that is not the whole of their relationship.  And while their enjoyment and pleasure in these ritualistic, gorgeously shot activities is genuine and intense, they are still a kind of metaphor for the deeper meaning these two characters find in each others company, for the understanding that they engender in each other.  THis is not a story about sadomashochism-rather it's a story about a dominant and a submissive who happen to fit each other in almost every other way as well.   <br />    And the pro-sex feminist in me thrills at a piece of fiction treating sex and sexuality as a way to empower a woman rather than demean or degrade her.  The main theme of Lee's life pre-Mr. Grey is one of being pushed around the emotions she's too sensitive to fully absorb and family members too absorbed to help her.  At the beginning of the movie, she is a kind of victim, not of her self-mutilation but of the emotional abuse that is at the root of her self-mutilation.  But her relationship with Mr. Grey, even though it's abstract and unusual, allows her to claim her emotions, to choose her life and it's partner without regard to anyone else's emotions or opinions.  When Lee tells poor peter close to the end of the movie, \\"I don't want you\\" she is actually saying, \\"I want all of these other things and I will have them\\"  This is a giant step for Lee and one that the viewer feels she would've never made without a few cups of hot chocolate and a few well placed spankings.  Mr Grey has manpiulated Lee in the context of their dominant/submissive relationship, but her ability to own these moments between them have given her immeasurable confidence and joy.  (and yes, we kind of feel sorry for peter, but mostly because he hasn't found anything akin to Lee's strength in the post break-down world) <br />     When Lee places the certain object on the end of bed near  the closing moments of the movie, it is a symbol of the permanance, the indestructible quality of their love.  And in the actual closing moment, when Lee faces the camera and her gaze emits such power and grace and happiness she is daring anyone to tell her that she's wrong while also insinuating that such judgements are meaningless to her.  She is claming her own version of satisfaction and there is nothing more feminist than that.  ;)
B0002OERI0|5.0|I can't exactly say that I have been a fan of everything Green Day has done but I own and still enjoy Dookie and Insomniac. I will admit that upon learning of a new release from them, I thought that I would wait and read a few reviews first, before heading out to buy it. A mistake I will definitely not ever make again with Green Day. <br />   What a fantastic cd! Give me novacaine, Dearly Beloved, She's a Rebel, Wake me when September Ends, the list goes on. Boulevard of Broken Dreams? May be the weakest track on the disc. American Idiot? Close to the same. Please do not buy this cd based on these two tracks. Either that, or do, and be pleasantly surprised. Those who will inevitably grumble, \\"they're not punk anymore!!!\\"....get over it. They are morphing into a far more interesting band, wearing their talent on their sleeve. Those are the same people who whined about Stone Temple Pilots going downhill after Core because they moved forward and not every song sounded like Sex Type Thing anymore. See also Deftones who threw a monkey wrench at everyone with White Pony. Keep in mind, people that all that happens when bands grow like this, is that we all get too see and hear just how talented, diverse and creative they can be, and in some cases, not be. In Green Days' case, bring it on boys, you're in a great place. <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is by far the greatest documentary on any band, that I've ever seen, and for ten plus hours it better be.  Most people may think that this is too long, however, when watching this the time just flies by.  Although there is a seemingly endless amount of information, The Beatles Anthology is very enjoyable.  It gives the most detailed look at the greatest band in the history of rock n' roll, from their perspective.  Nobody could tell the story better than the Beatles themselves, and finally the world gets to see them.  For those who saw this when it was on T.V., the DVD's have over 4 more hours of extra footage.  Much of this stuff is great clips of Beatle performances and extension of topics that were already mentioned on the T.V. version.  Some of the new footage is an entirely new topic altogether, which makes the DVD's all that much better.      The Beatles Anthology has everything a fan could ask for.  From Ringo's birth in 1940, to the end in 1970, the remaining Beatles (along with George Martin and others) talk about pretty much everything they could remember from those turbulent years.  And lets not forget the music.  Not only does the band talk about the songs we also get to hear them, isn't that UNBELIEVABLE.  Well not really, but it is cool, and we get to see them perform many of their most famous ones along with countless others.  For me, episode five does the best job of this, and it's also what I believe to be the best episode.  It takes place during the height of Beatlemania, and starts off with the famous She Stadium performance in 1965.  From here, the performances just keep on coming.  Throughout the entire episode there are great performances of classic songs, along with detailed of accounts events and the making of their albums.  My only real big gripe about the whole set actually happens to be in episode five, and it is about Revolver.  Lately this has been considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and all that is really mentioned about it is just two or three of the songs.  Otherwise, everything's good.  The other episode I found to be very good, was the first one.  I didn't expect to really like this one too much, but it is very good.  In the other episodes the Beatles were stars, but in this one, they are just beginning and it is interesting to see the types of things they went through in trying to make it.     The Beatles Anthology is perfect for a big fan of the Beatles.  For the casual fan that would like to know their story, I would probably think about getting the Complete Beatles first, if you can find it.  However, for the person who thinks it is time to really get into this remarkable band, this is definitely needed.  Once you get this, you shouldn't be surprised if you spend all day watching it.  The Beatles are classic in just about everyway; from the way they worked their way to the top, to the music they made, this is their story.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|I have been exposed to Dream Theatre via Transatlantic and Keith Emerson's opinions on Jordan Rudess.  Saw them back up ELP in 1998 (Forgetable).  I am a long time Progressive rock fan, ELP, Yes, Genesis, KC, Marillion, you name it.  This is not and I repeat NOT progressive rock.  It is just Metal and nothing else.  I was so disappointed when purchasing this album, so much so that this is the first review of any album I have ever bought (over 400).  Anyone who calls this or anything by this band progressive should be shot.  Metal is not progressive.  I loved the work Portnoy did with Transatlantic and I am not denying the incredible musicianship of Dream Theatre, but this is metal and nothing but.  A waste of money for any progressive rock fan.  I rate this album 2 stars only because there are great musicians at work(?)here.
B00005JN4H|2.0|I haven't seen the original French film this movie was based off of, but I can almost gaurantee that this American-ized remake had the French laughing their butts off all the way to the STOP button on their remote. This is a classic example of America taking something that isn't broken and trying to fix it.<br /><br />Taxi is a rather formulaic comedy that includes car stunts, bikini wearing bank robbers, a supped up taxi, BMW's, little to almost no comedy and a storyline that allows for little progression or originality.<br /><br />The biggest let down for Taxi was that nearly every single joke or humorous moment fell flat on its face. And the performances from Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon (sadly to say) were not all that great, probably due to the shallow and boring characters they were cast to play.<br /><br />The only thing going for this movie was the cool car stunts and the angles they were shot at. And for me as a guy, the bank robbers were pretty good to look at too. Those were really the only things that kept this movie at being just a crappy movie and not a completely horrible movie.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|unearth differs greatly from any other metalcore band on the scene. the twin guitar attack consists of 7-string guitars instead of 6. the song \\"zombie autopilot\\" makes your stereo count backwards for a bit and then comes the forward assault. my favorite song on the cd is \\"black hearts now reign\\" because i have seen the video for it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel since the beginning, I was initially less enthused by this one until I actually saw it.  Now, it is clear that as good as Buffy and Angel were, they were the stepping stones to this, Joss' most intelligent and adult series.  With involving characters, gripping plot lines and witty dialogue, Joss created a world where the were no black and whites, but only shades of gray and yet his heroes were more compelling than any others to date.  With every episode, the Firefly world becomes more complex and rich.  An adventure, a western, a space epic, a comedy, a drama  Joss managed to blend genres into something new and wonderful and something we are not likely to see on TV again.

5550155184|4.0|Action sequence in the story already started on the first few pages of the book.  Nothing catches a reader's attention more powerfully than a dead man posed as the Vitruvian Man and the sign of the pentacle at the same time.  And what better place to have committed the crime of murder than the fancy security-armored vastness of the famed Louvre museum.  Add a beautiful French cryptologist to the already charming aura of my favorite symbologist, trying together to solve crimes and riddles while outrunning the French police, and you have the formula for the book that will keep you up late nights turning pages.<br /><br />I believe the greatest strength of Dan Brown is his power to fuse fact and fiction in a gripping tale of adventure.  He has the very rare talent of sensationalizing what would otherwise bore us from another angle.  Among the topics he deals with in this book are The Da Vinci Code (an elaborate field of research and conceptualizing on its own), the life and works of Leonardo da Vinci, Priory of Sion, Opus Dei, and, among my favorite parts of the adventure, riddles.  Who would believe the dark symbolism in The Last Supper would survive centuries of Vatican power?  Who would believe another Da Vinci art called Madonna of the Rocks carries underneath it a shocking anomaly from centuries past?  Who would have imagined a secret war waged by two opposing religious groups - Opus Dei and Priory of Sion - has been raging since the era of Christ?  Who would have thought Da Vinci lived such eccentric lifestyle?  All of these things, and more, are handcrafted and offered by Brown on a silver platter.<br /><br />Although the story is rich in action and gripping facts, it's a lullaby of the most boring romantic tale ever.  I had to breeze through pages trying to get past Langdon's and Neveu's little sweet talks because it's a proven fact:  Brown sucks at romantic lines.  You will read Angels & Demons and Deception Point with a similar observation, although this little setback won't necessarily ruin your enjoyment of Dan Brown books.  Romantic or not, he writes well-researched material packed with fast-paced action and amazing trivia that will put you to the edge of your seats.<br /><br />So, for the most part, the book is \\"unputdownable\\".  It's definitely a must-read.little setback won't necessarily ruin your enjoyment of Dan Brown books.

It's definitely a must-read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When Radiohead came into the music they did it their worst record called Pablo Honey, later they improved greatly with The Bends an amazing rock album but nothing could prepare me or the world for what they would unleash the masterpiece called OK Computer this album is right there in my opinion with The Beatles Sgt. Peppers, Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here(their best one not the overrated but great nonetheless DSOFTM)and Zeppelin's IV. OK Computer is a concept album about how society has transformed humans behavior in a robotic way of thinking an interesting concept one that is so true these days.  <br /> <br />I ain't gonna do a song-by-song analisys because all of them are classics what I'm gonna talk about is the arrangement or order of tracks and how something so simple as the order of songs can affect an album the best example of this is the transition of \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\" with \\"No Surprises\\" the former is an exersice of paranoia a song about going crazy is followed by \\"No Surprises\\" the sweetest song on the album, a lullaby is this sort of arrangement that helps create this masterpiece it can also be seeing with \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"Fitter Happier\\" but I'll let you discover that for yourself  <br /> <br />In short this album is the album to represent rock's music in the 90's not Nirvana \\"Nevermind\\" or Pearl Jam \\"Vs.\\" although those are great albums they cannot compare to Radiohead \\"OK Computer\\".
B00003CXC6|5.0|A Warrior, his Wife, and a Thief encounter each other in a forest.  The Wife is raped and the Warrior dies. Establishing who is responsible for what and what truly happened proves difficult, if not impossible.  Through a series of flashbacks and stories-within-stories we come close to learning the `truth,' learning the limitations of `truth' in the process.<br /><br />  I approached RASHOMON with a certain amount of trepidation.  I watched it years and years ago and don't remember much about the first viewing.  I'm happy to report that RASHOMON can be enjoyed without notepad or textbook.  It's a beautiful looking black-and-white film that was more or less Kurosawa favorite Toshiro Mifune's coming out movie.  Mifune plays the Thief with a full palette.  As the various stories unfold, the Thief ranges from noble to craven, from hysterical to plotting.  Sometimes Mifune seems a little... excessive to me, but sooner or later I catch up with what he's doing.  In other words, he's brilliant, and repeated viewings won't catch him playing it false.  And if there's ever been a movie that rewards repeat viewers, it's RASHOMON.<br /><br />There are classics and there are Classics, and Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON is a 600-pound lumbering giant of a Classic.  Capital-C Classics can be a little intimidating and more than a little disappointing.  RASHOMON can be enjoyed without digging deep into it.  The commentary track by Donald Richie is informative, if a little didactic.  He tends to tell us what we're seeing, although he compensates by also letting us know what to look for in repeated viewings.  The introduction by Robert Altman could probably have been dispensed with without too much harm - basically it's six minutes of Altman telling us how much he likes the movie. The except from The World of Kazuo Miyagawa is interesting and abrupt.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|My 17 year old daughter loves this movie and bought the recently released directors cut.  I'd only seen part of the original version, so this cut was my first full viewing.<br /><br />I can see how this film has acquired cult status, my daughter loves it and thinks it's much better than The Butterfly Effect, however, I didn't agree, I thought this flick was a bit disjointed.<br /><br />I would definately recommend watching this film if you're into this kind of film, it's certainly entertaining.  Whether or not the film version or the directors cut is better, I'm not sure.  But I do know I enjoyed watching the film and discussing some it with my kid.<br /><br />You'd probably have to be really into the story to want to buy this latest version, but if you're thinking of getting for a gift to the older teen, twenty-something set, you'll probably be doing ok.
B00003CXCT|4.0|The original 'Star Wars' trilogy is perhaps the most well-known series of movies ever made. In 1977, 1980, and 1983, three landmark action/adventure films were made. They were: Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return Of The Jedi. I will now rate each one. <br /> <br />STAR WARS (9/10) For 20 years, this was the most successful motion picture ever. The story of a young farm kid who becomes a Jedi-in training with the help of the rogueish Han Solo (Harrison Ford). <br /> <br />EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (10/10) While this was the least successful of the trilogy, I like it best. There is more action than the others, and it shows better character develpment. <br /> <br />RETURN OF THE JEDI (8/10) Return Of The Jedi is the worst of the original trilogy, while still being a very good action movie, all the actors are too old, and it seems to lack the power of the two others.
0140277447|4.0|This gripping look at Japan's brutality in China is not for the faint of heart.  Author Iris Chang used official documents and interviews with aged survivors to narrate one of the most overlooked chapters of 20th Century genocide.  When Japan's imperial army captured the Chinese city of Nanking in 1937, their soldiers exacted a blood-thirsty revenge.  As this book shows, no Chinese were exempt from the seven-week orgy of murder and rape that followed.  Japanese soldiers used Chinese prisoners for bayonet practice, shot entire families, and raped women by the thousands (usually killing their victims afterwards).  Recoiling in horror, a handful of western officials, missionaries, and others (led ironically by diplomat John Rabe of Nazi Germany) worked to establish an international safe zone that saved thousands of Chinese.  Still this powerful narrative shows that Japan's army murdered an estimated 300,000 Chinese citizens in the space of less than two months.           Journalist/author Theodore H. White wrote similarly of Japanese atrocities in China during the war, but his writings are tame compared to this book.  Also, in the TV documentary American Century newsman Peter Jennings interviews an aged ex-Japanese soldier who admits to having particpated in these atrocities and to having felt no remorse until years later.  Author/journalist Iris Chang (1968-2004) tragically took her own life a few years after this book arrived - perhaps writing this narrative added to her burdens.
B000001EAQ|5.0|U2 made a serious effort to lead instead of follow. This has a much more original feel to the playing. Pop is the last classic album that still sounds great after all these years.   <br /> <br />Pop provides a compelling snapshot portrait of their career as a experimental band. After this overlooked and underrated gem, they sold out by releasing corporate radio-friendly items as ATYCLB and HTDAAB. After listening to this, you'll know why U2 was the quintessential band - credits must given to Radiohead as well - of the 90's.  <br /> <br />It's so sad that U2 left behind an amazing musical legacy by releasing those disastrous mainstream albums, supported by their friendly media, I mean, Billboard, NME, Rolling Stone, All Music Guide, Mojo, MTV, etc. <br /> <br />This one is a masterpiece among masterpieces. Their finest songwriting is presented here. Songs like 'Gone', 'Please', 'Discotheque', 'Do You Feel Loved', 'Mofo', 'Staring At The Sun', 'Miami' or 'Wake Up Dead Man' are such a brilliant ones, and on so many levels too. Musically it is a master work. <br /> <br />Pop is an album album that intellegently express vehement hatred toward the corporate world's replacement of human emotion and personality with businessmen behavior in their attempt to be \\"more professional.\\"... sadly, U2 have become in that corporate sellout personalities.  <br /> <br />A beautiful, intelligent album, which doesn't come along that often these days.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|When I saw the theatrical movie preview of this film in Cinemark 22, I thought it would be interesting to see.  When the movie came out, with the help of a good publicist, managers and agent, suddenly the name \\"Ashton Kutcher\\" was everywhere on television.  Of course we know him from \\"The 70's Show\\" tv series, but everyday on tabloid television we heard about Ashton Kutcher.  Then when we saw him with his girlfriend, well that was the top of the cake.  More publicity.  The only way Kutcher got knocked out of the news was when it was announced (Pardon me for saying this.  This is quite a shock) Chris Rock was going to host the 77th Academy Awards.<br />  After recovering from that, I put off seeing this film and waited months before I finally decided it was time to see it on DVD.  \\"Additional Scenes\\" and both versions theatrical and \\"Director's Cut\\" on one disc peaked my interest.<br />  Evan (Logan Lerman) has had some real horrifing things happen in his young life so far.  He visits his real father who is in a psycho ward.  The visit starts normal, but suddenly when he opens his eyes, he sees his father trying to ring his neck in full anger.<br />  The neighbor kids are with Evan (John Patrick Amedori).  They want to blow up a mailbox with an explosive.  They wait for the explosion.  When Evan comes to, he someone is in the woods.  Evan has blackouts.  He doesn't know what has just happened. he keeps a diary of his blackouts.  Nobody will tell him what has happened while he is out, so he still doesn't know.  It bothers him.  A solution to the problem, him and his parents move away.<br />  Now in college, Evan (Ashton Kutcher) hasn't had a blackout in seven years.  A date finds his diary and he begins to read it.  Suddenly the horrible memories come back to him.  He now knows how he blacked-out and the lost memories are now returning much to his horror.  He goes back to his old hometown to get answers with some horrifing effects.<br />  This DVD version gives you the chance to see the \\"theatrical version\\" or the \\"Director's Cut\\" version with a different ending.<br />  \\"Infinifilm\\" can be chosen to play during either versions while you watch the film,  deleted scenes, casting, storyboards and alternate scenes.<br />  The theatrical version and ending is better.

B0006399FS|1.0|There have been very few records that have been hyped as much as this one in recent years. But the truth is that this is U2's \\"Let it Be\\". A lot of hype has been made about the fact that U2 is a return to the band's older days. But what all of this assumes is that the older days can be replicated with a few Edge's trademark guitars and keyboards. That assumption begs for a lot, though, and the fact that this album is full of poor lyrics that are extremely poor sung, all atop a poor mix of instruments.  <br /> <br />\\"Original Of The Species\\" comes off as the worst song \\"U2\\" have ever recorded, of course their semi-official magazine \\"Rolling Stone\\" aren't agree at all - have you noticed that every new U2 album is reviewed as their best effort at least in 10 years for those \\"critics\\"? -, but just about any other person with functional hearing. <br /> <br />This is just bulls**t which might not even inspire you to pick up the album ever again after hearing it for the first time. It simply Doesn't measure up to U2 standards. It's worthy - as \\"Let it Be\\" - just in case you want to hear the musical document of a band's artistic breakup. <br /> <br />This half-finished piece of copy-paste jobs from \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" got the worst U2 album reviews ever, even worse than \\"Rattle & Hum\\". I agree with fans reviews. People just showed them that sometimes fans are right in criticizing their music, and the mass media are just as sellouts as the own band.  <br /> <br />I don't know how they come to tour this s**t. <br /> <br />It's time for unreleased DVD and CD stuff instead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|1.0|Yeah the concept of American Idiot is exactly the same as Madonna's American Life. So if these fellas think they're original, i laugh in their face.<br />If you wanna hear real rock music try the Rolling Stones or the Doors. They can craft a good rock song. Green Day come back onto the scene when they need money, they aren't serious about their craft.<br />They opened the doors for the likes of Good Charlotte and Avril Lavigne. Is that what you call an accomplishment?
0451191153|3.0|There's no question that The Fountainhead presents some fascinating ideas.  But the book is also infuriatingly inept: it's written in a tired melodramatic style, the characters are unbelievable (especially the love interest, Dominique), and worst of all it is way, way, WAY too long.  This last fault is particularly unfortunate because many of the book's most interesting passages come in the final 200 pages. <br /> <br />Having forced myself to wade through the entire thing, I have a recommendation for future readers.  I suggest that you begin by reading the speech made by the book's hero, Howard Roark, to the jury in a climactic trial scene.  (It takes up about 8 pages in Chapter 18 of Part 4.)  Although the speech is put in Roark's mouth, it's clearly unfiltered Rand, and it lays out her philosophy and the book's point.  The rest of the novel is simply an illustration of that speech.  Once you've read the speech, you can go back and speed through the rest of the book, seeing how Rand envisioned her ideas in practice. <br /> <br />The 2005 Centennial Edition of The Fountainhead contains as an appendix a useful small selection of Rand's notes for the novel (showing, for example, what she saw each character as representing).  A second appendix provides an introduction to Rand's belief system (Objectivism), but Roark's speech covers much of the same ground more entertainingly. <br /> <br />It should also be pointed out that the Centennial Edition is missing lines of text in at least two places (one being the end of Chapter 11 in Part 1).  I guess it's a sign of Rand's repetitiveness that even the copy editors -- folks who are paid to be bored -- stopped paying attention after a while.
B000002U9W|3.0|Many people will probably say that this album is too long and self-indulgent and in many respects, they are right.  This album is not without its charms, however.  I like the lush orchestration of the first track, even though the sheer length of the suite (and indeed the entire record)can get a bit tedious at times.  It can be quite pretty! <br /> <br />All in all, I bought this album to see if it was as musically dense and whimsical as I had been told - I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />In short, you should probably buy this album if you want to hear what Pink Floyd can do when they have an entire orchestra at their disposal.  If you want lean, uncomplicated rock music, buy something else! <br /> <br />I think this is a nice effort, representative of an important phase of Pink Floyd's career.  Listen to it and make up your own mind.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|If you are a hopeless romantic, and love a love story, this movie is definitely for you. <br />Emmy Rossem is an enchanting and vulnerable Christine, wooed by the sensual, mysterious Phantom (Gerard Butler) while her childhood sweetheart, Raoul (Patrick Wilson), tries desparately to protect her.   <br />Don't compare this to the stage performance--just appreciate it for the depth it brings to the characters, and a new way of seeing and hearing the story.  Butler's emotional performance will help you understand Christine's dilemma in choosing between her two potential lovers. <br />You will definitely want to watch this beautiful film many, many times.
B000002KHH|5.0|It's a very confident band that greets us on this landmark album.  By this time, Black Sabbath had well and truly decided that heavy metal, gloom and doom was the way to go!  Even so, the listener can still hear vestiges of the band's blues roots on tracks such as 'Hand of Doom' and 'Fairies Wear Boots'.    This album contains so many heavy-metal classics that almost every track is instantly recognisable to even the most clueless of rock listeners.    From the opening crunch of 'War Pigs', to the last notes of 'Fairies Wear Boots', this album remains a testament to the godfathers of heavy metal.
B000002OHX|5.0|I discovered WA in the early 70s and would recommend any of their albums thru 1980..and this LIVE set is an excellent example of WA mkI for the sound that was WA....after the original lineup was split....the sound changed a tad with the switch from Ted Turner to Laurie Wisefield.  The trademark WA sound was still unmistakable.<br /><br />Martin Turners growling and snarling precision and thunderbird basses thundered as he meshed into a solid groove with Steve Uptons drumming.....I actually feel they premiered as a live act....so much raw energy and stamina emulated from these superb musicians....dual leads that seared.....never missing a note....and switching off on lead and rythym duties....(I always hated bands who had to dictate who was a lead or rythym guitarist..like it was a bad thing to be the lowly rythym guitarist?.)  well...these guys moved beyond that...and the result on their discs is perfection....<br /><br />Score this selection and you wont be disappointed.
B000002J1U|4.0|This is a great album, even though it is usually overlooked by casual fans because it contains mostly acoustic material. It is, undoubtedly, Led Zeppelin at their most mellow.The material contained herein is not what most people think of when the topic of Led Zeppelin is raised and it was a shock to even the most ardent fans when it was released in 1970.      It would be fair to say that most people were expecting material that was more in the vain of the first two albums and were surprised upon receiving this record.    Even so, it does contain some crunching hard rock moments, such as the unrelenting opener, 'Immigrant Song' and the pleasingly offbeat 'Out on the Tiles'.     I guarantee that this release will grow on you and you too will realise just what a risk it was for Led Zeppelin to step out of the rock 'n' roll mould for just a little while. Led Zeppelin III was a gutsy manoeuvre that paid tremendous musical dividends.    Enjoy!
6305388458|4.0|The more controversy this movie caused, the more my mom didn't want me to see it--well obviously I just had to go see it. now, since I'm blind, I couldn't drive myself to the movie, and didn't have cab fare. so my sister took me. I spent the whole movie laughing like mad. She spent it saying \\"When do I laugh?\\"  my wife says much the same, since her parents bought me the DVD for Christmas.  there's no way to make anybody but an afficionado see what's so screamingly funny about this movie.  It's better than their other movie, \\"Holy Grail,\\"--and that was a darn good flick!  and how do you not like the closing song, \\"Always Look on the bright side of life.\\"  I try to remember, after a brutal work week, that \\"Life's a piece of s--t, when you look at it,\\" as Eric Idle sings in the song.  this is money well spent.
B0002OERI0|3.0|I've never been a huge Green Day fan. I liked \\"Good Riddance (Time of your Life)\\" but that was about it.  Then I heard \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Boulevarde of Broken Dreams\\" and I thought, this is pretty good. <br />Of course I expected to see a prominent \\"Warning\\" label splashed across the CD cover, but it was still sad to see.  Call me soft, goody-goody, or whatever, but personally? I hate swearing. It's uneccessary, and this album is strewn with it.  Rather than buying the CD I borrowed it from a friend, and I liked what I heard.  The songs are good, some of the lyrics are different and interesting, but the profanity? Too much. <br />If you're not fazed at all by coarse language, then this would be an excellent CD.  Otherwise, leave it on the shelf.
0792844890|5.0|This is even funnier than \\"Life of Brian,\\" which I have also reviewed.  I love \\"star Wars,'and my wife doesn't--so we can both laugh like crazy at this parody of it, and other sci-fi movies.  In our house we always say we're calling for \\"Pizza the Hut,\\" when we order out  when I'm describing the latest idiocy done by the bosses where I work, I finish by asking, \\"Do I suck, or do I blow?\\"  and of course, before a large meal, I whisper to my wife, \\"Bye-bye diet alarm,\\" a gag on one of the lines Joan Rivers delivers so expertly.  This, and \\"Blazing Saddles,\\" were Mel Brooks' two finest movies, no contest.  buy them and weep--from laughter.
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard \\"My Immortal\\" I thought it was the most beautiful song I'd ever heard, so I borrowed \\"Fallen\\" from a friend to have a listen. <br />I was totally blown away.  (So I went out and bought it.) <br />Before this, I wasn't really a fan of hard rock, and mainly listened to pop.  Let me tell you, I have been converted.  The guitars on this are GREAT!  Blended with the occasional orchestral backing and electronic effects, the instrumental versions of these songs would be awesome on their own.  But Amy Lee's haunting voice is the icing on the cake, and then some.  She has the best voice I have ever heard, and she's not afraid to have her own style, too. <br />Most of the CDs I buy get played to death for a few weeks, then shelved to be pulled out occasionally for a listen, but this CD has been my favourite for nearly a year, and is showing no signs of fading yet.  No other CD I've bought has ever lived up to this, and I don't think any CD ever will.  I love every single track, there's no filler.  It'd be near impossible for any artist to top this one.
B00003CWRX|5.0|The Insider is not a movie that will get most people's blood pumping. However, for me, this movie did just that. Al Pacino's performance is, as usual, amazing. He never seems to disappoint when he is in front of the camera. Russel Crowe turns in one of the best performances of his career. I thought that his acting job in this movie far exceeded his performance in Gladiator. The movie was a little slow in some places, but the overall tempo was very good. Mann's direction was excellent in adding different elements just at the right time to keep the story going. Although not the typical action movie that most fans like, this drama is an excellent movie for those who are looking for an interesting movie or for great acting.
0385510438|5.0|Parts of this book were hard to read - I definitely wouldn't call this light reading! Details of the crime committed were hard to read - I cried a little while reading it! <br /> <br />This book really is about the white/black relationships in the deep south a few decades ago, as well as the story of the trial.  <br /> <br />I found the details interesting - I was very involved in the story, and really cared about the characters. Unlike \\"The Jury\\", this book is much more emotionally intense - much more about the characters, and less suspenseful. <br /> <br />The plot was interesting - I had no idea how it was going to turn out, which is pretty typical for me when reading a Grisham novel. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite books by him.
B00003CXCW|5.0|\\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is one of the best films ever made. I could go on for hours describing the sheer brilliance of this film, but I'll be brief. The story is about this young Hollywood writer that's trying to write a new screenplay, but he somehow finds himself meeting a former silent film legend. The movie engulfs you into a dark world full of deceit, betrayal, lies, death, love, and envy. The film noir aspect of this film is used quite brilliantly, so it's no wonder why this film is hailed as a big classic. This movie is truly one of the most definitive Hollywood films ever made. I highly recommend this film to anyone that enjoys movies, so they'll know what a great film is.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Obviously a love it or hate it type of a movie.  I'll tell ya though, I had absolutely NO opinions on this movie whatsoever before I rented it.  Actually it looked sort of stupid.  I watched it and laughed a handful of times. <br /> <br />Well then I waited a couple of days and popped it in again.  CRACKED UP.  I guess you don't pay as close of attention the first time, but the second time you know what to expect and it's hilarious.  I've watched it five times now and it keeps getting funnier.   <br /> <br />There is a portion of the population with an odd sense of humor.  I guess I'm one of them.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Jaws is simply the greatest monster movie, and it is also a great film on many levels, and considering its worldwide notoriety, I wont go off on that tangent. <br /> <br />Jaws 2 is simply a low grade remake. <br /> <br />I have the distinct pleasure in saying that I have seen all the Jaws movies at the theater, some of them on opening day. As a fan of sharks and movies, its an addition I suppose considering that I have also rented everything at Blockbuster that has a shark on the cover or in the title. My expertise on the genre is admittedly self proclaimed, but if I get some business cards stating as such, maybe my following review with have greater credence.  <br /> <br />Jaws 3 is a very bad movie. Starting with the writing, production, acting, horrific 3D effects and most notably, a waste of a big shark gone amuck in Sea World. The hope that the shark will take control of the park is the only redeeming value of the story, but that is dashed. Why didnt the shark eat at least 4 of those show waterskiers? Because it is a very bad movie. The shark is right behind them when they fall, but they get out of the water just in time. The opportunity to turn the Jaws movies into a dynasty was destroyed here. Let the shark feed and live in a controlled habitat. Up until 2004, there had never been a great white shark held in captivity for more than two weeks. This movie could have served as a platform for shark observation and debauchery. This movie could have allowed the importance of shark preservation to be its theme, while showing numerous attacks of workers accidently falling into the water, the shark occassionally breaking out or maybe the brakes fail on a tour bus and it flies into the lagoon. Now thats entertainment with numerous possiblities. But noooo! <br /> <br />Jaws 4 on the other hand at the very least has good people eating scenes. Granted this shark has issues and the motivation of the shark to seek revenge against the Brody family is laughable, it does at least provide laughs. And I suppose some food for thought, sharks are people too. It also provides Micheal Caine falling for Mrs. Brody, proving there is life after the unfortanate loss of Chief (shark killer) Brody, as well as letting us witness the grown Brody kid get eaten. The special effects are better than Jaws 3, and the attacks are more frequent. Shark movies need to have shark attacks, and Jaws 4 delivers. I give this 5 stars as only a comparison to Jaws 3, when compared to Jaws it gets ZERO. <br /> <br />Sure its disappointing that the shark gets blown up in the original film, but this is argueably the only movie that is better than the book. <br /> <br />
B00000JR29|5.0|Flawless songwriting, technical proficiency, strong melodies and pleasant harmonies - this is what Tears for Fears is all about. They proved this to the world with \\"Songs from the big chair\\".<br /><br /> The music is rich and has an inherent freshness that time could not possibly destroy. It almost appears that the duo has paid excessive attention to every note and detail of their music. The highlights of the album are \\"Everybody wants to rule the world\\", \\"Head over heels\\", \\"Shout\\" and \\"Working hour\\".<br /><br /> For those that crave \\"quality\\" music, this album is your key to that!!!!
B000002ITM|5.0|Testament's fifth studio album really shows some awesome talent. Some people have dismissed this album as being their \\"sellout\\" album, which is not true. The songs are simply more melodic than the songs on their past albums.  <br /> <br />The album opens up with an amazing solo by Alex Skolnick, which leads into the album's best song \\"Electric Crown\\". Other gems include \\"So Many Lies\\", \\"Let Go Of My World\\", \\"Return To Serenity\\", and \\"Troubled Dreams\\". Are you a fan of thrash metal? This album is for you.
B000000WA4|5.0|I'm not trying to be snobby, but god. take a look at some of the one-star reviews of this cd. these people are just idiots. here's what one of them called the album: \\"Meloncoly and the Infinate Sadness.\\" ok, you have the cd, right? how hard is it to spell the title correctly? another said \\"Oh sure, there are some moments when everything sounds beautiful and uplifting, but that's only when Billy Corgan is'nt singing... The man simply can't sing. His voice is TERRIBLE.\\" i admit, not everyone likes his voice, in fact my girlfriend can't stand it, but its a part of what makes the Pumpkins what they are, and they're just amazing. \\"If you consider lots of screaming and cuss words music, go for it.\\" there's another idiot. go over the songs in the album. how many songs is he screaming? i'd say about 2, and that's out of 28. how many \\"cuss words?\\" Billy's lyrics are meaningful and not vulgar; there's almost no swearing in the entire album. \\"But those 70's dinosaurs were singing about babes, school, babes, and, well, babes--really kind of positive things in a rock-and-roll sense.\\" that review argued that 70's pop is better. i have no problem with 70's music, but i like my music deep and meaningful. do you honestly want short little catchy songs about \\"babes\\"? you can't get blissfully lost in music like that. the Smashing Pumpkins are one of the greatest bands ever, and they don't deserved to be trashed by people who don't understand that emotion can be a part of music. the Pumpkins weren't grunge, but they came out around the time it was going on. they shouldn't be in a category; they're just great music. Listen to Galapogos, In the Arms of Sleep, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, By Starlight Lily; these songs, if you're in the right mood, are just unforgettable. Billy Corgan's talent for song-writing can't be matched, and his lyrics are right from his heart, and they speak to everyone who even has feelings. buy this cd; you will not be dissapointed. also try Siamese Dream, Gish, Adore, basically just listen to the Smashing Pumpkins, and don't judge them by their singles.
1592400876|5.0|Many of the reviews of Eats, Shoots & Leaves focus on Truss's inconsistencies, or on the English/American usage issues, missing the book's soul. Truss hasn't written a punctuation manual, she's written a love letter.  <br /> <br />Questions of usage really are secondary to the book's purpose--it's more like a phone call to a friend after a first date when you just need to talk about the object of your affections in detail. Some might find it odd to lavish such attention on colons and dashes, but to those of us that Truss has dubbed \\"sticklers,\\" it comes naturally. <br /> <br />A usage manual, it's not. (If you're looking for one, try Karen Elizabeth Gordon's The Well-Tempered Sentence.) But it's still got a spot on my desk right alongside the photo of my family. <br /> <br />It's an interesting, at times laugh-out-loud funny, tribute to punctuation's checkered past and precarious future, and, for those who love language, a great reminder of why we fell so hard in the first place.
B000002N9L|5.0|I think people who trash this cd didn't really listen 2 it.  With songs like \\"I rock there4 I am\\"\\"Dig U better Dead\\"\\"Same December\\"and \\"I like it there\\" It is easily one of his most underated cd's.  His guitar is amazing all thru out. GIVE THE MAN HIS PROPS and forget the fact that it was intended as a \\"throw away\\" album.  Prince's trash is far better then most artists hits and any real music lover knows it.  The only good thing about this cd being overlooked and underated is that 4 those who don't already own it U should be able 2 buy it at a discount.  Lucky U!!!!!!!! <br />Keep on keepin on Purple Hippies
B0001AP12G|4.0|This album was unescapable in 2004.  Remarkably, it lives up to the expectations.  We all knew Kanye was a great producer from his work with everyone from Talib Kweli and Jay Z, but where this album really impresses is with its lyrics.  Kanye, is funny, intelligent and his flow sounds great.  He does a great job of walking the line between \\"socially conscious\\" hip hop a la Mos Def and The Coup and commercial, materialist hip hop like that of his labelmate Jay Z while at the same time showing the pointlessness of drawing such a division.  Hip hop is just hip hop regardless of the record label or how many units it sells and what's good will last and what isn't won't.  My favorite hip hop artists have always been the ones like Wu Tang Clan, Outkast and now Kanye West, who inhabit that divide between the underground and the mainstream and who just make the type of music that they want to make, regardless of commercial or credibility concerns.  And really, no hip hop fan can deny the talent displayed on such \\"College Dropout\\" tracks as \\"Spaceship,\\"  \\"All Falls Down,\\" and \\"School Spirit.\\"  The only reason this album gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the sheer number of skits and the filler-like nature of a few songs. If I was Kanye, I wouldn't have given such great beats as \\"Get By\\" and \\"Lucifer\\" (to name just two) away to other artists (Talib Kweli and Jay Z, respectively) just before my own album was released.  If Kanye had kept such beats for himself this album would be an undeniable 5 stars.  As it stands, this is an intelligent, unique album that's slightly inconsistent but definately worth a purchase.
B0006399FS|1.0|The only song worth anything on this cd is Vertigo other than that it blows!!  This band has seen better days and is releying on their name only to sell cd's and not their abilities.  They should of called it a day a long time ago.
B0000009OP|4.0|Jazzy, bluesy, noirish songs about sex, drugs, and romance.  All sung in an ultra-seductive, ultra-cool manner.  You really can't argue with that.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|I'll make this quick.  It's a great set and the entire discs should be explored except for the commentary by the critics.  These morons have no concept what the movie is about or the philosophies behind  it.  Nothing but a bunch of yes men agreeing with each other  and then contradicting with what they talked about earlier.  Skip it, and move on to the commentaries by Dr. Cornel West, and Ken WIlber.  They not only give insight to the philosophies but enjoy themselves  while doing it.  Enjoy!
B00004X0Q0|4.0|I feel really bad for At The Drive In.  They had people on all sides telling them what they were and what they should be and how they should do what they do.  Very few bands can handle that kind of pressure and it's definately understandable why the band broke up after completing this album, their major label debut.  They might have broken up, but At The Drive In really did get the last laugh because this album is awesome and defies many of their critic's expectations.  The sound on this album is bigger and more mainstream than their other records but instead of watering the band's sound down, this \\"sell-out\\" makes them sound even more powerful and emotional.  Everything on this album is turned up all the way.  I think they knew they were breaking up when they recorded this because every note sounds like a violent last scream.  This could become an exhausting listen if the intense playing wasn't backed up with so many great songs.  Starting from \\"Arcarsenal,\\"  this album is filled with unpredictable and exciting songs that match complexity, melody, and aggression about as well as any band could.  For those of you who have to classify a band and understand it only in comparison to other bands, I'd say a less hardcore version of Refused is your closest bet.  The critics who compared At The Drive In to Rage Against The Machine or (at the opposite end of the spectrum) any number of generic emo bands were only giving a superficial listen and trying to sell the band one way or another.  This is music that demands to be listened to, felt, and played with.  Not classified.  I miss At The Drive In but I'm glad they were able to leave us with this great last document of their brief existance.
B00005JN0T|2.0|but very little else.and yes,we get the point.mr willenium hit the gym hard.i hope in the year 2035 apartments arent that shabby where there are no shower curtains.and whats with the skullcap exposing only 1 ear?a 2035 trend?anyway,enough nitpicking.the movie itself was a good idea taken from an idea best left alone(mr willenium is to bland for such a concept).in 2035,robots are the new pet.for every 5 humans there will be 1 .mr willenium has issues stemming from an incident where a robot had to make a choice.during a caraccident in which his vehicle and that of a family carrying a young daughter,the robot chose willy.of course his paranoia is mocked at 1st(couldnt you smell the stereotypical police captian a mile away?)turns out that his instincts were justified as the robots led by a program called V.I.K.I. which pits new robots against old ones and any human who gets in the way.even with the flimsy script and ultra lame quips(aaahhhhhhh choooooooooo!im alergic to B.S.)a different actor would have been more convincing.and how did ms calvin become mrs rambo all of a sudden?the effects were worth renting but youd have to be a hardcore will smith fan to buy.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I loved \\"Mer De Noms\\" but this album doesn't live up to its predecessor.  It's not a bad album by any stretch of the imagination, but the songs are simply not as memorable as the ones from \\"Mer De Noms.\\"  It says something when the best song on an album is a cover that sounds little like the songs that surround it (\\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is a cover of the band Failure...yeah i've never heard of them either).  Other good songs here are \\"Blue,\\" \\"The Noose,\\" and \\"The Outsider,\\" but nothing really matches \\"Mer De Noms,\\" despite being veyr similar in approach.  I think the problem is that this album is too polarized.  \\"Mer De Noms\\" blended its atmospheric elements with the heavy guitar rock pretty seemlessly, but here we have airy songs and we have heavy songs with very little gray area.  This makes the album seem schizophrenic and somehow tiring to listen to.  I always find myself sifting through my CDs and saying, \\"Oh, there's that other A Perfect Circle album.  Lemme put it in.\\" and then after about three songs I always just skip to \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" and then stop the album and listen to something else.  That doesn't make \\"The Thirteenth Step\\" horrible, just disapointing.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|If you saw this gentleman perform on the Today Show on Valentines to that amazing couple who are meeting and beating the challenges presented them, you would have run out and bought everything this guy has done - just like I did and why didn't I find out about him sooner!!!!!!!!!!!! His live songs sounded as pure as his recorded ones and I don't think there was a dry eye in the house that day. <br /> <br />Mr. Buble has an approach to music that is evident on this cd (and his others) and thats to take good songs and make them better and he's done it with 13 most excellent works here - including a sparkling duet with Nelly Furtado and another infusion of talent with Chris Botti playing on another track.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This my favorite Wu Tang album.  It ditches the ultra-intense everybody-on-the-mic atmosphere of \\"Enter The Wu Tang\\" since the focus is squarely on GZA (despite numberous guest appearances from all Wu Tang Clan members)and replaces it with a creepy, even more subterranean feel.  This is some of RZA's darkest and heaviest production.  It fits perfectly with GZA's grim voice.  GZA always sounds threatening and scary but unlike the hyped up Ghostface Killah or macho-sounding Raekwon, The Genius portrays this with a laidback, creepily calm flow.  And great lyrics that are both streetwise and surprisingly complex.  Whether he's describing criminal fantasies, autobiographical slices of street life, or simply destroying rival MCs with battle rhymes, GZA sounds both wise and scary, kinda like an aging kung fu master who could kill you with his pinkie finger.
1592400876|5.0|I borrowed Eats, Shoots & Leaves from my local library because I'd heard about it but didn't think I'd enjoy it. Was I surprised! The book is full of examples of how poor punctuation mangles meaning, with clear guidance on how punctuation should be used. But perhaps I enjoyed it more than some of the other reviewers here because, like Ms. Truss, I'm a stickler and can't bear to see poorly punctuated signs and headlines. I enjoyed Ms. Truss's sense of humor and, frankly, some of her jokes had me laughing out loud. <br /> <br />I don't however, recommend the book as a guide for American readers who need help with punctuation. The differences between punctuation in British and American English are considerable at times -- for example, the placement of periods at the end of quotes and the use of periods in abbreviations -- and someone who is not aware of the rules may be confused by the examples, which usually show the British style. Instead, the book is better for readers who already have a good grasp of punctuation. The book includes fascinating history, colorful examples, and hilarious commentary. Who'd expect that in a book about punctuation? <br /> <br />As for my library copy, I'm bringing it back today. I've already ordered a printed copy from Amazon.com to send to one of my editors (who I've nicknamed \\"the comma king\\") and an audio copy to listen to on my next long drive. Somehow, I get the feeling that hearing a British voice read the book's text will make it even more enjoyable.
B000002L9J|2.0|The Smiths are going through some weird mini-revival now that all the emo kids and trust fund college students are trying to impress their friends with their taste in the \\"classics,\\" but guess what?  This album is still as mind-numbingly boring today as it was when it was first released.  This sounds like U2 trying to sound like Joy Division.  Only nowhere hear as good as Joy Division and only slightly better than U2. Somebody needs to slap Morrissey and tell him that smug cleverness is not the same thing as attitude and that putting psuedo-gothic song titles on bland pop songs don't make you deep.  I really can't stand this stuff....
B00062IVKS|5.0|Raging Bull is one of the most gripping, brutal, and magnetic films ever made. I myself am not a fan of boxing--I find it hard to like sports that I wouldn't enjoy playing myself. However, like or dislike of boxing doesn't really matter in this movie. This movie features Robert De Niro at his best (long before slumming for sub-par Hollywood comedies and slashers) as famed boxer Jake La Motta, whose massive insecurity makes Woody Allen look arrogant. Always worried about his wife leaving him, at one point grilling his brother (Joe Pesci, in his memorable screen debut) to see if he had, uh, indulged, La Motta was like an alternate history version of Brando from On The Waterfront, only with many more \\"F\\"-words--he wanted more than anything else to be the top, and then when he got there, he promptly lost everything, no longer having any worlds left to conquer. De Niro, of course, put on a ton of weight for the movie's end, and he delivers really bad stand-up in anonymous night clubs, having alienated nearly everyone in his path by his various demons and neuroses.  <br /> <br />This rise-and-fall picture was filmed, of course, by Martin Scorsese, and was definitely passed over for Oscars in its time (I won't diss Ordinary People because I loved that movie too). Maybe they should have been co-winners for Best Picture? Then again, Citizen Kane didn't win Best Picture either, and How Green Was My Valley was a much worse film than Ordinary People. This film, along with GoodFellas, represented Scorsese's apex--exciting, gut-wrenching, powerful cinema. He will probably get a few long overdue Oscars come the end of February, but it will be just like Paul Newman's win for The Color of Money (another Scorsese film)--an apology for not being nominated for more worthy work. Awards, though, don't matter--the work does. For an extraordinary film, look no further.
B00005B36H|5.0|The vibe on Lateralus is more mystical and reflective than on the previous albums.  The sense of humor (AEnima is secretly one of the funniest albums ever made) is gone here but Tool more than make up for it with a heavy conceptual feel and even stronger compositions (the word \\"song\\" doesn't really seem to fit here).  Tool has a way of making an album feel at once ridiculously complex and sublimely simple.  Likewise, each composition feels tightly wound but in reality, this is their most expansive collection yet.  The lyrical motif of the spiral is quite fitting for this album because listening to it is like being inside of a steadily unfolding spiral.  If you listen to the album focusing on things like songs and hooks you simply won't get it.  I reccomend lying back and just letting it play.  After a few listens it should come to you.  Just relax...
B000777J2S|5.0|Well, this may be one of those \\"love-it-or-hate-it\\" cases, the kind of album you'll consider an extraordinary discovery that made your year, or the kind of music that makes unexplainable how the friend who turned you onto it, loves it so much.<br />What everyone might agree on, though, is that such strong reaction to it comes from one source, the band's powerful presence and distinct identity.<br />Practically every song hits a deep chord on you, each a different one, and a huge part of it is the exceptional dramatic range of Antony's voice, which infuses of a certain pouring of his heart. Imagine a more romantic and desperate, yet less operatic, Rufus Wainwright, without necessarily going over the edge.<br />Whether \\"Hope There's Someone\\" with its mournful tone, or the gorgeous and chant-like \\"My Lady Story,\\" or \\"For Today I'm Not A Boy\\" which is lovely and difficult -and a high moment in this album- as the music and the lyrics build together. Just in the first three songs, the group shows that they are a new and genuine sensibility.<br />As comparisons go, Antony and the Johnsons belong to the same emotive thread than the Tindersticks, most present in \\"Fistful of Love\\", and taking his own path on \\"You Are My Sister.\\" Yet, they would not be out of place backing Marianne Faithful or doing covers of Kurt Weil's songs.<br />The rest of the songs don't fall far behind from those I mentioned. Each may end up your favorite, and can be the code to a secret frequency in your heart, evoked not necessarily by the lyrics but a consistent -not repetitive- feel of being late-night and being alone remembering your life.<br />What is puzzling and particular about Antony is the innocence of his lyrics, even when addressing dark personal places, being just as true as the weary heart that he evokes in his voice.<br />All in all, this is the most impressive album I heard all year, even if it's so likely to divide the waters between worshipers and those stunned that anyone may like it.
B00000373U|4.0|Elliott Smith never made a perfect album, but every one of his releases was packed with at least a half dozen absolutely amazing songs.  Whenever anyone talks about Smith, especially since his apparent suicide last year, they mention how sorrowful his music is, but this is more than just mope-rock.  In fact, listening to Elliott Smith makes me quite happy.  There's something soothing and human about his voice and his lyrics speak to universal emotional concerns.  Anybody who's ever faced the unexpected in a relationship understands exactly what \\"Say Yes\\" is about.  In this way, Smith's music is comforting.  Even though Smith must have felt alone most of his life, his songs helped countless listeners know that they aren't alone no matter how alienated they feel.  Like I said, Smith never made a perfect album and one of his greatest songs, \\"Miss Misery,\\" is available only on the Good Will Hunting soundtrack but the songs he left behind are truly among the most beautiful and sympathetic ever written.
B00003CXBH|5.0|There is a historical and sorrowful story about how colonial imperialism and a church more concerned with its political power than its charge to protect its new native converts, lead to the destruction of a South American Indian tribe.  This movie captures that story powerfully through an excellent mixture of dramatization and historical faithfulness.      It is to the credit of the film that it avoids coming off as moralistic, judgmental, or naively black and white.  This is not to say that this is not a clash of good and evil, it is. Slavery is evil.  The church's shift from offering true sanctuary to the hunted natives to abandoning those sanctuaries is evil.  The political struggle between Spain and Portugal that creates the opening for the slavers to resume their trade is evil.  But would it not also be evil if the intercession of the church resulted in the destruction of its ability to do any good elsewhere?   The film avoids characterizing this latter concern as of no consequence, but its narrative shows that the wrong decision was made.      Another moral issue that arises is the choices two Jesuits make  when they decide to resist the church's decision to abandon the Indian sanctuaries.  One, a former slaver and mercenary, chooses to lead the natives in battle.  The other, to whom the maxim \\"God is love\\" is the foundation of his worldview, chooses to lead the natives in prayer.  Here again, however, the film does not treat the correctness of either choice as a foregone conclusion.   You feel sympathy and understanding for both paths.      A closing dialogue captures one of the movies' messages.  A governor is consoling a Bishop who is not sure he made the right decision about the native sancutaries:    Governor:  \\"Your emminence, thus is the world\\"    Bishop:  \\"No, thus have we made the world.\\"    The acting is superb, the cinementography is truly beautiful, and the message is conveyed through the narrative rather than through preachy dialogue.  This set also includes welcome features, including a full-length director's commentary and a documentary that visits the South American location and the plight of the natives there.
B0000A118M|5.0|How did a human being do this?!  So otherworldy and yet so tightly constructed and economical.  So furious and atonal and yet so gorgeous.  Coltrane must be an alien or an angel or a chemical experiment gone out of control.  You heard it here first.  Oh yeah, his drummer is pretty out of this world too.
B000001EAQ|5.0|\\"how in the world am I going to review this?\\" This album truly changed my life. It's a part of myself. Pop is just an experience, something you must listen.  <br /> <br />On Pop you'll find very high level of musicianship, really amazing. The starting to this is best described sounding like an electronic garden, but not a very happy one. Mind blowing.  <br /> <br />Despite it was Achtung Baby that - beyond doubt - separates U2 into it's before and after periods, Pop really hasn't anything bad to say about it, is keeps the listener attentive all the way through breeding great hooks with real musical complexity. Very different from any angle. Also captures a great range of feeling with the bleak horror of Please and the elegant simplicity of Wake Up Dead Man. An excellent album, by the way, the last U2 excellent album.
1577311523|4.0|Are \\"you here now\\"? So lets go! <br />First I have to say that the message itself is good, very good. After all, in a world like the one we are now, any message that can bring people some contentment has certainly some value, no matter the name attached to its label. Mr Tolle seems to have had a spiritual experience that has transformed his being, therefore his life, and like many have said before me, it sounds like a true and sincere experience. The first thing to ask is: Does that \\"happen\\" to everybody? And although his view is that \\"enlightment\\" is happening now, in this present moment, many have also noticed that although the promisse is inspiring, the facts are not so. And is not because \\"my mind is in the way\\", it is simply because enlightment does not have a rule, or a \\"manual\\", so to speak. That is what makes it so miraculous, so unique, so searched for. If it could be learned in a book, any book, the world would certainly be different. This is not an advice to not read the book, quite the opposite, I really enjoyed, was inspired by many passages, and even the fact that it is very repetitive did not seen to diminish the value of \\"pointing\\" to a different reality. <br />For some (more intelectual people) there are inquestionable falacies in the book (or in any spiritual message, for that matter), which to me again just mean that we have to be careful when saying that any book \\"tells the truth\\". For myself the \\"System\\" that I have chosen and has being quite miraculous and transformative, because has that emotional energy (like Mr Tolle) and some intelectual ground as well, is the Fourth Way teaching, based on Mr Gurdjieff and Mr Ouspensky methods. But as you can verify, that does not mean that I have to read \\"only books\\" writen by or in the line of thought of that particular way of \\"aproaching\\" the miraculous. Anything that can help give me a little \\"push\\" towards a more integrated life experience, with or withouth the \\"mind\\" will certainly have a space in mybookshelf. Mr Tolle works certainly will be there. <br />Others books that have had the same influence on my journey: <br />Fragments of an unknown teaching - In search of the miracuolous - By P.D. Ouspensky <br />Self Remenbering - By Robert Earl Burton <br />I AM THAT - by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj <br />Creating a Soul - By Girard Haven <br />The Theory of Celestial Influence - By Rodney Collin Smith <br />The Prize is Eternity - By Girard Haven <br /> <br />They are very different in the aproach, but they all point to the same perennial state. I wish it helps others like they have helped me. <br /> <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is possibly the most accurate and realistic depiction of contemporary love. The notion of true love in today's context is lost among a sea of infidelity, deception, lust, betrayal, jealously, cynicism, objectification, technology and vindication.<br /><br />Despite being set in slightly surreal environments such as a photo exhibition and a strip club, the writers and actors have successfully conveyed the emotions that run through typically dysfunctional relationships. In the end, the people involved in the web are either very certain of their own feelings finally or are so overwhelmed with rage that they become vindictive. The movie also explores the line between truth and lie; the difference each makes to a relationship and the consequence one has to bear for his/her actions.<br /><br />Julia Roberts hasn't got much for her role to begin with, but she shows a certain delicateness, straddling between guilt and liberty with her role that makes a performance that is sufficiently pleasurable. Jude Law packs both a cold yet emotive performance as a cheating boyfriend and later a desperate man stuck nowhere in both relationships. A performance good enough to warrant for an Oscar nod (but none sadly). Natalie Portman is stunning with middling traces of girlish vulnerability and womanly salacity, a role that won her the covted Golden Globe Best Supporting Actress. and deservingly so.  The most powerful performance must come from Clive Owen who starred in the original play. He's the one who's drawn into a destructive relationship with Roberts and turns sinister when trying to win her back through a series of confrontations and psychological manoeuvers. Both Portman and Owen have done exceedingly well to have overshadowed the leads in this case. All in all, a stellar cast and choice perfomances.  (PS: Do check out the cybersex chat between Owen and Law; now that's hilarious.)<br /><br />So, is love lost really lost? Is the sudden change of hearts actually beyond one's reasonable control? Find out in Closer,  then again you might never actually.d out in Closer,  then again you might never actually.
B000003S5H|4.0|It's really hard to find new music if you're over the age of seven these days. I'll save you my diatribe on what I think is the state of the music industry today...shall we say, horrid and just get to the point! <br />Unfortunately, to find anything worthwhile these days we must go back to move our music collections forward. It's great that bands like this one have the opportunity to get noticed more now.  <br />With songs like You Make it Easy and All I Need, this album has a smooth, cool, jazzy feel that is nicely done overall. It reminds me of two other bands I recently found from back then, too. Dancing in Dreams by Barbarian Lovers and Dark Adapted Eye by Danielle Dax are worth the listen if you're looking for some great new music not supplied by the lame music industry of today. <br />
B000001GGV|5.0|Pogorelich's Scarlatti is unsurpassed.  His interpretation of the Andante from Sonata in B Minor K. 87 is the most lyrical, moving you will hear.  Scarlatti is an underappreciated genius, and in the hands of Pogorelich, his music is timeless.
B00008MLSH|2.0|I find Netrebko to be hyped.  The basic voice is lovely and beautifully produced, but her bel-canto technique is not up to the standards set by other, superior singers in this much-recorded repertoire. The fact that her Jewel Song lacks trills or anything resembling them is a turnoff for me. And some of her runs and fiorature are uneasy.  She studies with Renata Scotto.  Couldn't Scotto have done something to improve her facility in this regard? Mme Marchese's absence is more lamented with each passing year!  I did not keep this recording and the frantic advertisements for her second cd (that's not make-up, it's war-paint!!) did nothing to make me want that either. Sorry, I can't recommend.

B000000LZV|5.0|I first picked up this album back when I was learning bass in the early 90's since Mr Watt (and this album in particular) was always listed as a major influence on so many other players at the time. Still listening to it daily on the ipod almost 13 years later.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|When my sister rented Napoleon Dynamite at Blockbuster the other night, I didint expect much out of the movie, seeing as the title charachter looked really strange, and the adds that were run during the theatrical release didint help to win me over.  After watching the movie, I admit that it was a plesant little suprise that had me chuckling a lot during my initial viewing. <br /> <br />If you want me to tell you what the plot is, I really won't get anywhere, because the movie has no real plot.  It's just a glimpse at the life of a high school nerd as he goes through a roughtly a month of his life.  As the movie moves from scene to scene, you never really know what to expect.  There's everything from a speech about japanese scientists trying to kill the loch ness monster, to time machines that need crystals to work.  The whole thing is so bizzare that it defies explenation.   <br /> <br />In an age where movies routinely have guns and huge explosions, Napoleon Dynamite has none of those things.  There's no special effects at work, there are no CGI elements, nothing.  The movie relies on it's charachters, and all of them turn in stellar performances.  Jon Heder is PERFECT as Napoleon.  With his monstorous 70's style glasses and ever open mouth, he's perfect as your steryotype nerd.  I love how his expression never changes during the movie.  I got the feeling that if he saw a nuclear explosion, he'd still have that bored look on his face.  It's a delight watching him.  The supporting cast is equally good, such as Napoleons dweeb thirty-fivish brother, his 80's obsessed uncle and the lovable Pedro.   <br /> <br />Other little things stand out here.  The music is both odd and disturbingly catchy.  The scenery of gorgeous Idaho is, well...gorgeous!  I love how Napoleon's house is retro 70's style, which matches his personality perfectly.  And a special nod must go to the dialoge, which has some of the funniest bits i've heard in years.  My favorite?  A certian scene withtupperware, \\"Dangit!\\"  <br /> <br />In conclusion, I find Napoleon Dynamite to be an interesting movie that is really quirky and has a lot of charm.  I'd certianlly be interested in \\"Napoleon Dynamite 2\\" if they ever create one.
B000002KON|5.0|I listened to the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and Neil Young for years and years, and all I knew about the Kinks was 'Lola','You really got me' and other popular U.S hits, But then I played around on the internet and discovered what I missed all those years THE KINKS. Arthur, is the best Kinks album and thats saying alot, because its one of albums that you can play all the way though with no bad songs, like Darkside of the moon, Sgt. Peppers,and Led Zeppelin IV. I think if you like the Beatles, Pink Floyd or the Rolling Stones you have to get this album.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|I considered seeing \\"Saw\\" in the theater. But previously released films kept me skeptical. These films were \\"Twisted\\" \\"Taking Lives\\" and \\"Godsend.\\" The first two films were recent serial killer dramas that were not only weak, but were also erroneously--almost sacreligiously- compared to the brilliant \\"Seven\\". \\"Godsend\\" kept me from seeing \\"Saw\\" because it shattered my faith in anything released by LionsGate Films. I had inklings of the mediocrity of the studio's output while watching \\"The Vampire Clan\\" and it was re-enforced later by \\"Open Water,\\" but it was also the studio that brought us the extraordinary \\"Frailty\\" which led me to believe that those films may have been just mis-steps.      \\"Saw\\" began to restore my faith from its opening scene. It showed me that low budget films could still be creepy without resorting to shaky camera work and natural lighting. In other words, not repeating \\"Open Water\\"'s aquatic Blair-witchery. But everything falls apart in the end. As the title of this review suggests, it is the most disappointing ending since \\"The Village,\\" but for the opposite reason. Audiences of \\"The Village\\" willingly suffered through the painfully dull bulk of the film, fully expecting to be rewarded by an intricate and crystalizing twist, only to be disappointed. Conversely, viewers of \\"Saw\\" would have been content with a merely satisfactory ending, rather than one that strove to be unneccessarily convoluted, and was ultimately confusing.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I heard this guy on David Letterman last night and I had to buy his cd.  He has one of the smoothest voices I have ever heard.  I can't stop listening to this stuff.  I am someone who appreciates all types of music genres and he is the only one that makes me want to listen to some old standard and swing music lately.  He really owns the microphone.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|This move is really good. I thouhgt it was funnier than it was scary, but that's just my opinion. If you like gore and demented plot lines, this movie is for you. With one of the most (if not THE most) unpredictable endings, Saw is an excellent film... I don't want to give away any hints (this movie would definitely be best if you knew as little about it as possible), so I suggest seeing it yourself. My only complaint is the acting could have been better, but it's not bad enough to make it a bad movie.
B0000844MR|5.0|I am a fan of 80's fantasy, and I think that this movie is perfect for other people like me. It has an interesting story, and very amazing visuals. A lot of artistic work, and imagination went into the design and production of this movie. Watching this movie makes me feel like I'd want to become a Gelfling, the elf-like boy on the dvd cover picture. Watch the movie and maybe you'll feel the same way too !
6303824382|5.0|This is a excellent action movie which is starring Bruce Willis as John McClane, Jeremy irons as the villain and brother of Hans Greuber(from the first one) as Simon Greuber, and Samuel L jackson as Zeus. It starts with a bomb in a NY shop then john being dropped off in Harlem with a sandwich board which says \\"I hate n----rs\\" Zeus who is in a shop and notices him goes over to him and says to go before the gang which are down the road see him, well they see him and beat him up then he gets a call to go to the subway in half an hour or he'll blow it up, Zeus gets there before but is late and the bomb blows up. then there is a bomb in the park which is disarmed by John and Zeus. Later there is a bomb in a school in NY and no one knows the code. John and Zeus look for him separately John drives through a dam and gets nearly flooded in. Zeus finds him on his ship and goes to shoot him but he hasnt took the safety capsules off and Simon takes the gun and shoots his leg.

They are rescued by a ship. Then the terrorists are celebrating their stealing of the gold until John and all the cops find him. then John shoots Simon down and then he says yipee ki yay mothaf-cker and it ends<br /><br />Overall you should watch this if u want a good action movie
B000002H33|5.0|Well, to tell the truth, my favourite album w. these guys actually happens to be Lightning, but I do have to agree this is another friggin' great album. <br />It's more professional and just sounds better kinda often. <br />My favourites would probably be Battery, Master of Puppets and Orion. Here are my views of the songs: <br /> <br />Battery - 10/10 <br />Incredible opener. First time I heard this, I actually didn't like it, but I got used to it and now I get big kicks everytime I hear the band screaming \\"Bat-te-ry!!!\\". <br />This song mirrors its precursor \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\". <br /> <br />Master of Puppets - 10/10 <br />This one's godly. On this song, the band proves their true musical talents, playing typical metal riffs throughout the verses, and suddenly calm down with caressing guitar harmonies.  <br />Sequel to Ride the Lightning, structure-wise. <br /> <br />The Thing That Should Not Be - 9/10 <br />I found this title a little simple, but the song rocks. It takes time to get used to, but it really rocks from then on. <br />Son of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\". <br /> <br />Welcome Home (Sanitarium) - 9/10 <br />Haunting ballad which opens with a simple, yet addictive guitar melody which is easily played on guitar by anyone. <br />Follow-up to Fade To Black, anthough not as good. <br /> <br />Disposable Heroes - 9/10 <br />Being a little \\"dry\\" to my tastes, it still keeps me entertained. <br />I love the bridge and the chorus! \\"Finishd here! Greeting death! He's yours to take away! BACK TO THE FRONT!\\" <br />A better version of \\"Trapped Under Ice\\". <br /> <br />Leper Messiah - 9/10 <br />Just like every other song on this album, this one mirrors another Lightning-track, and of course I'm talking about \\"Escape\\". This one's kinda brutal, and I simply adore those ephasised words: \\"Chain! Chain! Join the endless chain!\\" Haha! <br /> <br />Orion - 10/10 <br />Oh my god, this one's even better than \\"The Call of Ktulu\\" (its precursor, of course).  <br />The E-minorriffs by Hetfield and Ulrich are fantastically produced, and despite their simpleness, they call forth complicated feeling, typical to Metallicas songs. The real highlight here, though, is Burtons contribution, starting at 3:58 and seriosly shines from 5:40. Fantastic instrumental, and a very addictive bass solo. <br /> <br />Damage Inc. - 9/10 <br />I LOVE the intro on this song, it's so different. Cliff using a volume pedal while playing guitar chords was a GREAT idea. The main song seriously KICKS ARSE, although the ending isn't completely perfect. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't be dissapointed!
B00007E8V4|5.0|I was always hesitant to get this album because I thought this would just a collection of B-sides or rejected material.  This is not the case.  This could very well be their best album so far. <br /> <br />The best way I can complement this album is to say this: it does not need a skip forward button to be listened.  Even the best bands in the world love to throw in filler or bad experiments now and then.  System does not!  Every song is just really good. <br /> <br />This album has an unfiltered and unaltered quality that I find amazing.   While in their other studio release albums, they use Serj's voice to it's full effect and work the instruments to rightly emphasize his voice, this album strays away from that.  Boom! and I-E-A-I-A-I-O have a raw sound that is good abrupt and powerful.  System also gets laid back (well, as much as System can) with tracks that are melodic and simple (in a good way) with Highway Song, Ego Brain, and especially Streamline. <br /> <br />This is just a great album, plain and simple.  It has a weird, poetic, political effect with a great combination of harsh and melodic vocals.  Sixteen great songs for a lower than normal price makes me feel that I am actually stealing this album.  In my eyes, this album pushed  System of a Down from a band that I enjoyed to perhaps the greatest band in existence today.
B0006GQMC8|4.0|Here is an effective movie with Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin.  Previously the pair appeared together in at least one other movie, the World War II classic \\"The Dirty Dozen.\\"  This movie is significantly less sophisticated than \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" but is enjoyable for the running battle between Bronson, an individualist who just wants to be left alone, and a group of men out for revenge in the thinly veiled guise of a Mounties-led posse.<br /><br />Albert Johnson (Bronson) is minding his own business until he sees a dog being mistreated.  Being the person that he is, he saves the dog and in the process ends up getting accused of murder.  The group of men Johnson tangles with is clearly morally marginal characters, as is emphasized over and over so that you sympathize with Bronson from the outset.  In order to keep legal legitimacy in this frontier town, Sgt. Edgar Millen of the Mounties (Marvin), takes his shiny rookie assistant and gathers up a posse to take Johnson into custody.  Johnson does not want to be taken into custody and he is smart enough and clever enough and a veteran to boot so he knows how to foil the intentions of a bunch of backwoods rednecks that know how to shoot but not a lot else, at least in this movie.<br /><br />We get a basic understanding of which the important characters are when the posse surrounds Johnson's cabin.  After shooting the cabin full of holes the posse takes a look see to determine whether they did anything, whereupon Johnson leisurely takes his own, rather deliberate actions.  Of course the cabin is eventually made uninhabitable and Johnson is forced to head for the hills; sorry, make those hills mountains because they are in Alaska.<br /><br />Now comes the \\"Death Hunt\\" part of the movie, assuming that the cabin scene really was not a hunt since the posse knew where he was.  Except the only death is that dealt by Johnson.  The movie is really poorly named and just as easily could have been named \\"Johnson,\\" but that might have confused people with another movie.  I suspect that the person that created the title was running low on creativity that day.<br /><br />Now Johnson is running for his life, chased by men, dogs and an airplane.  Here is a bit of a twist.  This movie feels a lot like something that should have taken place in the latter part of the 1800s, but it actually takes place in the 30s, and machine gun armed planes were available to track down and shoot dastardly criminals like Bronson.  The pilot of the airplane is arrogant and supremely confident that his airplane can overcome any evildoer because it has technology and Johnson is just an ignorant backwoods criminal.  The viewer can see what happens in the battle between the airplane and Johnson.<br /><br />During the course of the movie we see that Sgt. Millen sympathizes and empathizes with Johnson.  As we watch the two men in action it is easy to see that they are actually very much alike, and as different from the other characters as they are alike.  Perhaps director Peter Hunt, who directed the James Bond movie \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" and was second unit director on a number of previous Bond films, was making a commentary on the imminent loss of individualism and personal integrity.  We too come to like both men and see that Millen is just as reluctant to go after Johnson as we are to see him go after Millen.<br /><br />This movie was released about a year or so before Sylvester Stallone's \\"Rambo,\\" and shares a number of similarities, including at least one scene involving a jump into a tree.  Rambo and Johnson are both ex-military.  Both men are quite good at surviving in the wild, and both seem to have special forces backgrounds or the equivalent.  Both men are loners and have a very solid sense of right and wrong.  Both men push back only when pushed.  Rambo battles a helicopter and Johnson battles a biplane.  Johnson and Rambo both jump into a tree to escape.  Johnson is wearing heavy furs and while thejump may have caused some minor injuries, he was relatively unscathed.  Rambo got a really big splinter in his arm and we got to see how macho he was when he sewed the wound without any anesthetic.  Johnson was only trying to survive rather than proving he was anything.<br /><br />This movie was influenced by a variety of sources.  You can see elements of Jack London's books and more than a touch of Bronson's earlier movies.  Bronson always wanted to be on the right side of the law, even if he had to take an action that others might consider to be illegal.<br /><br />If you liked Bronson's \\"Death Wish\\" movies, you will find this movie more subtle and complex, even though at its core there are strong similarities between the movies.  Of course, Lee Marvin always brings something special to any movie he is in and the careful screen choreography between Bronson and the much more vocal and expressive Marvin make this action movie a treat to watch.d while the jump may have caused some minor injuries, he was relatively unscathed.

B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is a great band.  They won a Grammy for best new artist and gained the 2004 reputation of being the band that it is cool for everyone to like, much like Cold Play in 2003.  This band has some of the greatest potentials I've seen in a long time; not only are the members great friends, but they are great muscially and vocally, with Adam Levine as the lead singer, this LA band could surely be here for a long time.<br /><br />\\"Harder to Breathe\\" is what originally introduced to Maroon 5.  I loved the sound of this group.  The music is good, the vocals are good, so I decided to listen to more of it.  This great song transitions greatly into \\"This Love,\\" one of the greatest songs on this album.  A lot of their music is very provacative, and that is a great new approach to this genre.  After seeing their videos, you understand their lyrics a lot better.  \\"Shiver\\" is another great song, very catchy, and very versitile in styles.  Although very pop, it brings a lot of variety to the album.  So so far the first three tracks sound completely different, that great.<br /><br />\\"She Will Be Loved\\" is another single they've made that is amazing.  The lyrics are amazingly good, and totally reminds me of just about every 80's teen flick with Molly Ringwald in it.  \\"Tangled\\" is a slower song that is really great.  Another edgy song that creates the fifth consecutive song that is completely great and completley different that the previous songs.<br /><br />\\"The Sun,\\" is another great, fun, and catchy song.  Adam can do anything with his voice, and in each song he proves what a great lead singer he is.  The lyrics are really good and emotional in this song.  \\"Must Get Out\\" has an awesome hook.  This song is incredibly catchy and definately one of my favorites on the album.  \\"Sunday Morning\\" is a much different song that I'm used to hearing from them, but somehow it works very nicely for them.  It has a lot of different styles in it, making it completely different than anything I've hard before.<br /><br />\\"Secret\\" is an okay song, but not one of the better ones.  Its a bit slow, and there isn't too much vocal in this song.  \\"Through With You\\" is a good song.  Its pretty catchy and pretty interesting and fun to listen to.  I love how this CD just keeps getting more variety as it goes a long.  Not many albums can be as versitile as this album.<br /><br />\\"Not Coming Home\\" sounds very pop, but its pretty good none the less.  The music itself is pretty weak in this song, but I thought the vocals were very creative.  \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" is another song that shows how good Adam's voice is.  The writing in this CD is very well done, and I'm very impressed with this debut band.  I hope to see more good things in the future,ything I've hard before. <br /> <br />\\"Secret\\" is an okay song, but not one of the better ones.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|thoroughly enjoyable cd from beginning to end with song styles and tempos that make the ride fun.
B000000WHX|5.0|...do not compare this to Esthero's \\"Breath from Another\\". Dude, i got that one like 5 years after buying this seminal CD.  I have to say, I am not doing much for my standing here, but this is a classic.  Maxinquaye, Blue Lines, Protection, A Normal Family, Dubnobasswithmyheadman, other sthi.  just listen to it.  sorry, wish i could come up w/ something better, but tha idiot befo me jus  pis me offf.
B000002HPV|4.0|Got this item over ebay for six bucks, what a steal! Its a great album. Bjork's creativity is dominant on this album. The downside is the album's short length (43 minutes). My ratings... from one to five stars. <br /> <br />Hunter **** - Luminating electronic beats and an inciting love song. Gets the album off to a good start. A metaphor for Bjork's search for love.  <br /> <br />Joga ***** Beautiful string ochestration. Great vocals with a strong sense of emotion and musical landscape. Probably the best song on the album. <br /> <br />Unravel *** Mellow, pretty little tune. Light string melody under Bjork's longated overtunes of vibrato. <br /> <br />Bachelorette **** Great show-tune-esque song. Powerful and thought provoking. Could see this capturing the audience of theater goers and musical lovers. <br /> <br />All Neon Like ** An alright song. A muffled beated synth song with a sense of tranquility and outreach in her voice. <br /> <br />5 Years *** simple keyboard riff rims a stiffled scottish techno beat. Great lyrics. A refreshing, different song for the avant-pop lover. <br /> <br />Immature **** note bending emphasis on her wonderful vocals. Simply just a relaxing song. Makes you wonder what she was just so \\"immature about.\\"  <br /> <br />Alarm Call **** this is not insult to Buddhism. Some people just don't take her lyrics thr right way. Its actually kind of funny. She has a line wear she says she felt so enlightened by something but ironically she's not very religious. A great song that makes you wanna just get up and run around. Very complicated vocals. Her throat must hurt after this song. Wonderfully arranged and fun to listen to. <br /> <br />Pluto *** An extreme, outrage of shrieks and ooohs soaring over a staccato techno beat. Most people seem to hate this song but its such a release of anger and frustration that makes you feel all wound up and then \\"All is Full of Love\\" comes in to calm you and relieve you.  <br /> <br />All is Full of Love *** catches you after Pluto. Simple lyrics but very emotional and feeling.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Beach Boys and Beatles, tra, la ,la...shouldn't we all like what we like? Yes, Brian was inspired. Yes Paul was inspired. Who's the real genius here? Music! Music is the real genius! I bow to you \\"M\\". You see what is missed. I see it too. Who else sees it?

0446608955|4.0|Ok, I won't say this book sucked, but it was a romance and romances are supposed to be sappy and stuff like that. I kinda liked this book actually, better than the notebook. The notebook kinda got on my nerves a little because Noah and Allie love each other and stuff like that, but...the man has a thing with diseases, people! I'm serious! In the notebook, she gets some sort of memory disease that mad eher forget he ever existed and in this book now, ( spoiler ) Jamie has cancer that cannot be helped and she dies in the end ( end spoiler ) and then in the notebook, they decided to go and do it for the whole day, making up \\" lost time. \\" I'm a Christian. Give me a break. It's all my mother's fault. Anyways, in this book, he only kisses her and holds her hand. I understand that one. Jamie is a little fragile throughout the whole book and I'm not saying that's wrong but...This book was a sad romance and I liked it. Better than the notebook once again.
B00005JMUA|2.0|I think the main reason Vol 2 is getting so many great reviews is because people are reviewing both movies as one or Because it's a Tarantino flick or both.  I'm a Tarantino fan and I love all his movies, all but \\"Foxey Brown\\" and of course Kill Bill Vol 2.  The only scenes or \\"chapters\\" worth watching in this entire movie was the Pai Mei one and The fight with Elle aka California Mountain Snake.  Everything else is just pointless filler.  I will admit that the scene of the \\"massacre\\" was necessary but dull and hardly worth the fuss.  It would have been better left as a mystery in Vol 1.<br /><br />But even if Tarantino wanted to add that scene he could have just done it in Vol 1 and also added the other two chapters and shortened the ending (useles super hero talk) and just released it as one full movie instead of trying to cash in on the \\"continuation\\" fad of filmmaking.  Lord of the Rings had to do it cause it really was a long movie.  But Kill Bill as a two parter was pointless.<br /><br />The ending of Vol 1 and the start of Vol 2 had me hyped up with the belief that I was in for a bumpy but great ride as The bride takes her revenge on everyone that wronged her until she gets to the final fight with Bill.  But as the movie went on the hype was replaced by utter boredom to nearly screaming in my mind for these useless scenes that drooned on for hours to just stop and move on.  There was no point at all for us to see Bill's brother going to work and talking to the strip club owner.  It was painfuly obvious that this scene is just filler to add bulk to the film.  Then the scene where Kiddo (Uma) go to visit the foreign guy to find out where Bill was, was too long, too drawn out, dull and pointless filler.  I couldn't even understand what the heck he was even saying.  Then after everything she drives on her way to Bill's and I thought, okay the real action is about to begin, this is where she finally Kill's Bill (cause after all isn't that the title?) this is what I've been waiting for.  The final match.  And what do we get?  The dullest most anti-climatic fight scene I've ever seen.  Now I was actually interested in what they had to say to one another once they finally see each other again.  So I didn't mind that scene too much, all but the stupid \\"Superman\\" theory.  And the little girl was a bad actress but then again she's a kid.  I could have delt with anything in this scene, even the Superman (...) if it had lead to a great final confrontation.  But it didn't.  It feel completely short and flat with Bill going out like a hero.  Heck it kinda makes me wanna see what Bill was doing while Ms. Kiddo was in the coma all that time.  I bet it would have been more interesting than the filler scenes I was forced to watch.<br /><br />Well anyway 2 stars for two chapters.g for.  The final match.  And what do we get?

B0006SSOHC|3.0|It was a decent horror movie. I psyched myself out for this disgusting amazingly scary film, but i completely over-psyched myself. This is a grade C mystery, not a gory horror movie. The acting was incredibly cheezy, and there was nowhere near the amount of terror i expected. There were no parts in which i jumped, no parts where i grabbed my stomach in disgust. HOWEVER:This movie is worth seeing once, because the ending is AMAZING. But to all my fellow horror fans, see it once, but dont get your expectations too high. If you want real gory horror, check out the 1974 version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's a classic.
B0006399FS|4.0|U2 albums often provoke discord among fans, and this album is no exception.  Some lament that U2 abandoned their punk roots after Boy.  Some lamented the stylistic change of Unforgettable Fire, the first of several collaborations with Eno and Lanois.  After Rattle and Hum, a mixed bag, most embraced the reinvention of Achtung Baby.  This reinvention continued with Zooropa and Pop, albums which left many fans scratching their heads.  With All That You Can't Leave Behind (ATYCLB), new admirers joined the U2 bandwagon while others perceived the beginning of the end.  With How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb (HTDAAB), U2 has attempted what I perceive as their first concept album...with mixed results and a sharp contention among fans as to the quality of this album.    The Album:  To me, the album is about regaining one's footing.  Shortly after the release of ATYCLB, the band put on its Elevation tour, the world changed with 9/11, and Bono went on his \\"odd couple\\" tour in Africa and promoted the DATA campaign.  After so much travel and seeing so much, a person could get lost.  This album is an exercise in self-reflection, an attempt to revisit the best and worst of the past to gain fresh perspective.    The Songs:  With \\"Vertigo\\", the singer finds himself in some smokey bar or nightclub.  Lost in confusion, he spies a woman with \\"Jesus round her neck\\" and finds an anchor there.  Temptation lurks around the corner:  \\"all of this, all of this can be yours\\"; this line is chilling and reminds me of Satan tempting Jesus after 40 days in the wilderness.  With this song, U2 return to their exploration of evil, as evidenced in \\"Wire,\\" \\"Exit,\\" \\"Until the End of the World,\\" and \\"The Fly.\\"  Given the commercialization of the song, \\"Vertigo\\" may be art imitating life.  Musically, the song has the same bouncy energy of \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"Elevation\\".  The song ends hopefully with \\"your love is teaching me how to kneel\\":  the themes of submission, prayer, and love recur throughout the album.    \\"Miracle Drug\\" is probably my favorite song on the album and boasts some very evocative lyrics in the first stanza and chorus, e.g. \\"Freedom has a scent like the top of a newborn baby's head\\"--if you're a parent, you'll understand exactly what that's about.  If the singer learned to kneel (and pray?) in \\"Vertigo,\\" he does it here in this song.  Musically, drums and bass conjure up the image of a man wheeling his wheelchair in the race for his life.  Some interesting background vocals highlight the prayer part of the song, and Larry Mullen contributes to them.    \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" is a powerful tribute to Bono's father.  Bono's falsetto is weaker here than in the past, but his butchered \\"the best you can do is to fake it\\" is brilliant songcraft; that contrast with the previous falsettos is heartbreaking.  The idea of \\"faking it\\", of pretending to be strong, of not being authentic, is a carry over from \\"Vertigo\\" and will recur later.    \\"Love and Peace Or Else\\" initially reminded me of \\"Miami\\" from Pop, but the song quickly changes into something very unlike U2's previous work.  A variety of themes crop up here:  laying down arms, the difficulty of prayer (\\"I'm not easy on my knees\\"), the need for a broken heart.  Some recur later, but the most telling line is \\"where is the love?\\"--perhaps this is the true midlife crisis of this album.  It is also an indictment, for the song is directed to professing \\"daughters of Zion\\" and sons of Abraham, whether literal (e.g. Israel) or figurative (e.g. professing Christian leaders bent on warmongering).    \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" returns Bono to New York, but, having seen the world in more ways than one, he sees it now with very different eyes.  I find the lyrics to be very telling--\\"The more you see the less you know\\"--and this song transitions us from finding no love in the world to finding solace in the love of one's life, an idea developed further in \\"A Man and a Woman\\".  \\"Can you see the beauty inside of me\\" highlights the growing fear mounting in Bono that he's not right inside.  A tad long, this epic song should sound magnificent in concert.    \\"All Because of You\\" is the hard-rocking crux of the album.  A professing Christian, Bono recognizes how his current state mirrors his salvation experience:  moving from confusion to \\"no illusion\\".  \\"You can see the cracks...and I want back inside.\\"  Bono's vocal here is irritating, but the song sums up very nicely the issues presented in the album so far.    \\"A Man and a Woman\\" is musically a very interesting departure:  soft and romantic.  Lyrically, Bono returns to the love of his life and reflects on the demands of being faithful:  \\"I could never take a chance of losing love to find romance.\\"  Oddly, he's found that a distance has crept into that relationship and another:  \\"but you're gone and so is God.\\"  Just what was on his mind in \\"Vertigo\\" before \\"Jesus round her neck\\" caught his eye?  On occasion, the vocal is vintage Bono, as in \\"like a stray dog\\".      \\"Crumbs from Your Table\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album, but it also contains one of the worst lines in a U2 song:  \\"Cool down mama, cool off\\"--yuck.  This song really spoke to me, because it reminds me of a relationship recently lost to me:  \\"You speak of signs and wonders/I need something other/I would believe if I was able/but I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table\\".  \\"Signs and wonders\\" may be a reference to the Book of Revelation; given the talk of Zion and Abraham in \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", this song may speak of Bono's frustration with those who preach love and peace but inwardly desire the destruction foretold in Revelation.  If so, then watch the last lines of \\"Yahweh\\" for Bono's view on this.  Musically, I should note that Bono does a great job on \\"you ate all your friends\\"--nice touch.    \\"One Step Closer\\" reminds me of \\"Running to Stand Still\\" from The Joshua Tree, but the lyric is rather simple.  It is redeemed by some nice vocals and imagery.  Basically, Bono now finds himself in limbo.  He knows he has the love of his life, but he also needs something \\"other\\".  Where to from here?    \\"Original of the Species\\" is a weird song.  Initially, it made no sense to me.  However, given the theme of confusion (fake versus real) that runs through the album, I think the song is basically a plea for authenticity:  if you can't stand the confusion, don't contribute to it, but rather be yourself.  Lines like \\"Some things you shouldn't get too good at...like...celebrity\\" and \\"some people got way to much confidence\\" seem a personal indictment, continuing thoughts from \\"City of Blinding Lights\\".  Musically, this is a cousin to \\"One Step Closer\\", but a rock song.    \\"Yahweh\\" closes the album in prayer.  \\"Vertigo\\" brought Bono to prayer again, back to brass tacks.  Now that God has his attention, Bono asks for simple things:  shoes that fit, a shirt that's clean (he's wearing old clothes, as revealed in \\"One Step Closer\\"--God gives new clothes only once), a soul that sings.  He's willing to accept those \\"signs and wonders\\" in Revelation:  \\"Take this city/if it be your will\\".  Ultimately, though, to have love (in the world or with his wife) and peace (in the world or with his friends), he needs one thing:  a broken heart.  That is how to dismantle an atomic bomb, harbinger of death and confusion.    U2's Legacy:  How does this album fit into the U2 legacy?  Thematically, it fits well with their past work.  It has political songs (\\"Love and Peace Or Else\\"), religious songs (\\"Yahweh\\", \\"All Because of You\\"), love songs (\\"A Man and a Woman\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\"), and songs of experience (\\"Miracle Drug\\" a la \\"Bad\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" a la \\"One\\").  Musically, U2 innovates little here and contents itself with revisiting the past...but that fits in with the theme of self-reflection.  The Edge revisits most of his trademark guitar work--sometimes welcome, sometimes tiresome.  Larryand Adam, oddly, stand out much more on this album than on previous ones, and I enjoyed actually hearing the bass line.  Their work is always serviceable and sometimes outstanding.  Bono's vocals are a mixed bag.  He's still got sound musical judgment (e.g. the nice butchered falsetto on \\"Sometimes...\\", various subtle touches on particular phrases in \\"Crumbs...\\" and \\"A Man and a Woman\\"), but the ragged singing from the throat instead of the diaphragm grows wearying after a while.  His problem may be that he's largely abandoned the endearing awkwardness and vocal abandon of the early years for a more disciplined, caged style...once well-mannered, I don't think you can become the primitive again, alas.  All and all, I don't think this album is the great departure and embarrassment that others have found, but cracks are showing.  Yet, Bono admits that in \\"All Because of You,\\" so is this an intentional exaggeration to show the cracks to all?  Only they know.    Personal note:  I lost a dear friend several weeks ago, and I was unable to listen to Andrew Peterson's Love and Thunder for three days; I even found it hard to listen to Mark Heard.  The only thing that got me through was this album.  I've been listening to it every day for weeks.  Is it U2's best album?  No.  As a mixed bag, it ranks with Unforgettable Fire and Pop.  Is it their worst album?  No.  The first five tracks are very good, as are some of the last songs.  The sense that production failed U2 is strong here:  it took EIGHT producers to put this thing together; even with Lillywhite's help, the cracks show.  Nevertheless, the themes of feeling lost and wanting wholeness again were a balm to me, and the music, oddly familiar, was comforting.  I recommend this album, a journey from confusion to clarity, from self-indulgence to submission.
B000092Q7O|5.0|Rocks. This movie was a true story and I didn't even know that until about the end of the movie. Adrian Brody delivered a masterpiece performance as Spilzman ( or however you spell it. )Hie role as this character made him seem real to those of us watching the movie. I never got to see this movie until last month because I wasn't allowed to watch it ( Don't ask. )Anyways, I thought this movie was going to suck and be bad and stuff like that. I was tired. That movie gave me a whoel new look on the way the jews and polish were treated and how the germans were so mean ( that is putting it lightly )But eeven though this movie is history, that does not mean it is inteneted for children. This movie includes lots of killing, murder, suicide, bomba and explositions, disturbing scenes ( somewhat ) and many, many curse words. The movie also has alot of dead people on the sidewalk and rotting, blood on the wall. Beware greatly. This movie is not intented for the squeamish and weak stomach stay away from this movie. But for those of you that have nice strong stomach and haven't seen this movie...watch t. You really don't know what you are missing.
034537410X|4.0|Steve Laberge's work was the culmination of a flurry of interest in lucid dreams that began in the late sixties and early seventies with works like ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS and THE LUCID DREAM MANIFESTO. Dr. Laberge was able to expand on these early treatises and engage a larger community outside of academia and this book is the result of that engagement. This is an excellent survey of lucid dreams with advice on how to achieve them. The book is also strong on examining varieties of lucid dream experience and therapeutic benefits of lucid dreaming. The book is weak on placing lucid dreams within a more general theory of dream content and cognition. Laberge's explanation for why we don't always know we are dreaming in a dream-because they follow the same neural pathways as waking perception and seem so real-is not persuasive. The world is still waiting for a comprehensive analysis of lucid dream experience and phenomenology on the level of Martin Heidegger's BEING AND TIME. Still, this is a most valuable book.
068987474X|5.0|BUT I loved it!  I thought it was hysterically funny and that the advice was right on target.  Sure, it was repetitive but I think that's because often women need to hear the same message over and over again in different forms.  That's because we do keep making excuses for men and we always think that our own unique set of circumstances makes us exempt -- certainly, I do.<br /><br />My problem with the book was that it was very black-and-white and it made huge generalizations.  Not every guy is supremely confident and capable of banging a woman's door down.  Nor is every man extremely romantic.  Some men need very direct encouragement from women before they'll ask them out.  Some guys still give their wives dishwashers or new microwaves for Christmas; they're practical not selfish or cruel.<br /><br />There could be a hundred reasons why a guy doesn't call a girl back after a date, and it isn't always because he \\"just isn't into her.\\"  However, the end result of a man not calling back is that the woman has no relationship!  That was the way that I interpreted most of the book.  Instead of saying \\"he's just not that into you,\\" I translated most of that to mean, \\"this guy is not going to be able to give you what you want.\\"<br /><br />One big issue that I have with the whole dating scene is the question of whether or not a woman should call a man to ask him out.  I've been involved in the women's movement all of my life.  I've always disregarded gender roles and done whatever I wanted to do.  When I deal with men and I'm not sure about my actions, I always ask myself: \\"what would I do if this were my girlfriend?\\"  Then I proceed as though the man is just like any other member of the human race as opposed to some distinct and alien entity.<br /><br />Theoretically, I believe that women definitely have the right to ask men out, to call them up, or to proposition them sexually.  BUT in REALITY, we are penalized for doing this.  Yes, it's 2005 but according to the way a lot of guys think, it's still 1952, except that men are happy that we have had a sexual revolution.  Makes life a lot easier for them, doesn't it?  I resent that double standard.  For many years, I said to myself: If that's the way many guys think, I will hold out and wait for a guy who doesn't hold those beliefs.<br /><br />Well, I've been waiting a long time! And as long as I have to live in the real world, I've decided to follow some of the advice in this book about letting man initiate in the beginning of the relationship.  I'm not into games and part of me thinks it's really stupid to do that, but a larger part of me says that if some man is interested in me, it can't be that difficult for him to pick up the phone and call me.  Seriously, how hard can that be?<br /><br />This book is a very funny read but it deals with a topic that can be painful for people who have had unsatisfying relationships.  I was never a huge fan of Sex and the City -- mainly because I couldn't relate to women who bought $700 shoes!  -- but I think there are some real pearls of wisdom in this book, if you can read in between the lines and get beyond the generalizations.<br /><br />Sigrid Macway a lot of guys think, it's still 1952, except that men are happy that we have had a sexual revolution.

B000002PH1|5.0|Belinda Carlisle was one of the foremost rock/pop songtresses of the eighties.  Although her US star faded in the US in the early nineties, she continued releasing albums in England.  I have purchased some of those as well, and they have been just as good as her original hits.  Not quite sure why she faded in the US, but her work is still top notch.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|Could have been better. Don't get me wrong. It was good and all, but Cura..whatever the dude's name is, did not take the time and correct small mistakes that most of us had probably noticed. Like the turning back in time scene, if he was going to have the characters go back in time and see themselves, their movements would have to be excat in what the doubles do and say and how they say it. Like this whopper of a mistake: <br /> <br />In the scene where Harry and Hermione go back in time see themselves talking to malfoy and his crew, Hermione ( the one in front of Draco ) has her hand behind her head the first time. the second time she has her hand to her side. heh, heh, bet you didn't catch that ine and this one, too: <br /> <br />In the same scene, when Hermione punches Draco, didn't she spin around this first time instead of already facing and hitting him the second time? <br /> <br />I caught thses mistakes. Take a look at the movie and you'll see what I mean.

B00005JM0B|2.0|It felt like Terminator 2 was the end, I mean, skynets ruined, the chips have been destroyed, and it's suppose to leave the rest up to the people to decide the unwritten future.  So at first, I immedietly felt like they were blowing a $170,000,000 budget on a unexpected sequal.  But being a fan of this series, I had to check it out<br /><br />Well it's gonna be hard to adjust with no Linda Hamilton, or Edward Furlong(Who was John Conor not Nick Stahl).  And it always has a bad guy or good, but it's bad, andthis time the antigonist is a female terminator, an enticer huh?<br /><br />Arnold is back, which is a good thing, cuz replacing him would be a travesty.  Other than him, the only other cast member to return was Earl Boen(Dr. Silberman)  Who in this movie felt like he saw a ghost.  James Camron is not back to dierect, because of problems with Linda Hamilton, and he felt like the series was complete when T2 was finished.  Well is that good or bad.<br /><br />Anyway onto the story.  Judgment day wasn't stopped it was postponed, so here we go again.  Well the action sceenes are nowhere near as spectacular as T2.  This Terminator feels like it ain't going all out, which the previous 2 did, they seemed like they wound never stop, but this one looked like one that could be challenged by the protagonist. And it doesn't give a real sense of danger like the previous 2 did.  Not only that, this film was nowhere near as groundbreaking as it's predicessors<br /><br />I didn't expect alot from this movie, but dang!  I though it woulnd'nt be this bad.  Man if only James Camron were behind the film or if it were never made.  They were trying too hard for a sequal that never should have been made.  It was boring most of the way, it felt like it tried to move with the style of new films, and the real geniouses behind the series, sadly, werent there to finish it off.  I'm very sad to see such a good series get tarnished by it's final film.(Nearly the same thing that happened in the Godfather PT.3)  The only reason this film is bairly even rentable, is because Arnold is still around, but he couldn't fill the shoes of those who left.<br /><br />peacepened in the Godfather PT.3)  The only reason this film is bairly even rentable, is because Arnold is still around, but he couldn't fill the shoes of those who left. <br /> <br />peace
B00006RINF|4.0|Lacuna Coil recorded their first album (an EP) in 1997. Since then, they have made another album in 1999, one in 2001, and one in 2002-that would be this album.  Comalies is probably their best album.  The songs are pleasing to the ear, and you never get sick of them.  This is called Lacuna Coil's breakthrough album-they've had two singles and they've gotten some radio play on stations in New England. <br /> <br />1. Swamped- This is the second single. Cristina does a nice job singing in this song.  It's very catchy, and the lyrics are very true to life.  There are some nice guitar parts, too. <br /> <br />2. Heaven's A Lie-The second single.  It's another great song, with a nice opener-a piano.  Definitely another good song. <br /> <br />3. Daylight Dancer-Personally, I don't like this song as much as the previous two, but it's still nice.  There is a clock ticking throughout most of the song, and although I don't remember the song having anything to do with time, the ticking clock fits in with the song. <br /> <br />4. Humane- This is a nice song, with a nice beginning as well.  Probably not one of my favourites, but a decent song. <br /> <br />5. Self Deception-I really like this song.  It follows a simple formula-Andrea sings a bit, then the chorus a few times...The chorus was done well. <br /> <br />6. Aeon-It's short, and sweet. About thirty seconds into the song you hear something that would make you think that the CD is scratched-it's not, on the live version of this song they do something similar.  This is probably a good song to play if you want to introduce someone to Lacuna Coil. <br /> <br />7. Tight Rope-This song was well done also, rather atmospheric (which is a word that many people used to describe Lacuna Coil's music). A nice song, by all means. <br /> <br />8. The Ghost Woman and the Hunter-This is an absolutely beautiful ballad.  It's melancholy, but it's wonderfully done.  The chorus is absolutely heartwrenching.  This is a wonderful song. <br/> <br />9. Unspoken-This is probably the song that sounds the most like something you'd hear on the radio-it's basically all centered around the guitars, but it's a great song, it's actually probably one of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />10. Entwined-This is another slow song, I like it.  It's all about being entwined, as the title suggests. A nice song-it revolves around some type of synthesizer, I think. <br /> <br />11. The Prophet Said- This song rather reminds me of Unspoken-mainly focuses on the guitar, but nice vocals all the same. <br /> <br />12. Angel's Punishment-A gorgeous song, if the word gorgeous could describe this song.  It's about war, and I think it's very true to life, it's sad, but very, very good. <br /> <br />13. Comalies-This is definitely a good song to close the album.  It's slow, and the end is great.  It's partially sung in Italian-songs sung in foreign languages are lovely, even though I don't know what they are saying, I always love them.  <br /> <br />Lacuna Coil is something to listen to if you are tired of what is on the minastream radio station in your town or city. (Unless...it happens to be playing Lacuna Coil.)  They are not a pop band,they could be categorised as melodic rock, if you will.  If you like Nightwish, you will probably like Nightwish. <br /> <br />Also-I've seen people compare Nightwish and Lacuna Coil-there's no way to compare them. Cristina Scabbia doesn't sing operatically (which I made up spontaneously, it may not even be a word) but she is a great singer with what she sings-Tarja Turunen is an OPERA SINGER-no way to compare.
B00004W199|5.0|Well, I'm a pretty serious horror fan, I think, but I  lean heavily towards modern stuff.  I have some theoretical interest in pre-Night of the Living Dead horror cinema, but defintely not as much as I have for the post-NOTLD stuff, and I really haven't gotten around to seeing much pre 70's work.  Sure, I've seen pretty much all your classic Universal films at some time or another, though most of them so long ago that I couldn't really tell you how much I'd like them now.  Other than that, I haven't really seen a whole lot other than what you see on MST3K.(Which actually comes out to quite a few cheap old horror movies, even if they aren't in their original or intended form)  And, those films aren't too encouraging, naturally, though they aren't meant or expected to be. (Though I do rather like 'The Screaming Skull')  Despite all that, I was very interested in seeing this film since the first time I heard about it.  Fortunately, it didn't disappoint.  Certainly, not everyone in a modern audience is gonna be able to get into a film this old and cheap, but some if your the sorta person who can you shouldn't hesitate to check this out.<br /><br />The basic setup is that our protagonist, Mary, is in a tragic drag racing accident, where her car is dumped off a bridge into a river.  Still, she seems unscathed by the incident, and goes on with her life, moving to Utah and becoming a church organist.(Funny, I didn't think that Utah existed in Movieland, or pretty much any of the south west or mountain west, other than an endless, nameless desert, perhaps inhabited by cannibals. Admittedly, it is mostly just endless desert, but we've got cities and lights and running water and all that.)  Things seem to be generally okay, except that she is haunted by strange visions of a desiccated, mysterious man(inspiration for the Tallman, I'll bet) eerie music, as well as other bizarre occurrences.  While reading about 'Carnival of Souls' I constantly here it compared to the 'Twilight Zone'.  This is not without good reason, as it does feel very much like that show. (Whether or not you enjoy 'The Twilight Zone' is perhaps the best test of whether or not you'll like this film.  Personally, I love it.)  As a matter of fact, the final revelation basic nature of this film are pretty much identical to that an early (and classic) 'Twilight Zone' episode.  Some may claim it's stolen, I dunno, but it doesn't really matter.  The film has some very good ideas of it's own, most of which are more interesting then the basic revelation of the film.<br /><br />This film was definitely made on the cheap, something like 30,000 dollars, so you certainly aren't gonna see anything fancy, even by early 60's standards.  Still, it is competently made, with a very eerie, shapeless yet somehow still melodic organ score, and some striking visuals.  Scenes of ghoulish individuals rising from a lake or dancing about a deserted pavilion are particularly affecting, as is the apparent head ghoul, played by the films director, Herk Harvey.  In fact, pretty much all of the scare tactics used in this film are pretty cool, though I don't want to hurt it by going into any more specifically. The performances do tend to be pretty amateurish, but that rarely matter all that much in horror films, this one included.  They also appear to be trying to portray particularly banal, lifeless individuals, which makes their performances less of a concern.  The landscape, though shown relatively little, is quite effective, as it isn't gorgeous or lively, just cold and ugly and dead, which is, naturally, fitting to the tone of the movie.<br /><br />The film isn't without  a few flaws.  First of all, Herk Harvey's character randomly appears maybe 2 too many times I think.  Also, the climax is less effective, as it often is when atmospheric films finally start to have something actually happen.  Still, it is very enjoyable as a whole.  Not a scary film, but a fairly eerie one much of the time, provided you are willing and capable of getting into it.  Perhaps a full-on five star rating is slightly generous, but this is about as good as I could hope for a horror film of this sort to be, so I'll let it stand.d capable of getting into it.

0736041850|5.0|This book has been very helpful to me in free weight training to validate if I am concentrating on the correct muscles in an exercise.  The presentation is colorful, rich and engaging.  This is the only exercise book I have seen that approaches the weightlifting body from the inside-out.  In addition to the terrific musculature and skeletal diagrams on each page, the exercises are explained briefly but in sufficient detail with pointers for what to do and not do.  The most popular exercises are presented here, organized by major and minor muscle groups.<br /><br />This is not another encyclopedia full of exercises (though I find those helpful too).  This book helps make you more aware of your muscles so you have another way of visualizing correct form in an exercise.  The diagrams depict both men and women in a realistic way so both genders can benefit from the book. However, Delavier has another edition of this book showing other exercises popular with women.<br /><br />I work out at home so without the benefit of trainers or other experienced lifters around me, I have found this kind of info invaluable.  Make yourself a smarter lifter and get this book for education and reference into the future.

B000000OS2|5.0|This was the performance that inspired a decade of MTV Unplugged (can MTV ever come up with ANYTHING original on their own?), and is an essential addition to any music collection.  The performances are perfect because they were never intended to be on any official release.  Recorded by chance, and compiled, mixed, and released only after an unexpected demand, it captures the band's intimate performance while they were at their best.  It is certainly one of the best live CDs ever released, and the best of the Unplugged era. <br /> <br />To whomever hit the record button that night....thank you.

B000641Z90|5.0|I would give Phil's newest dual-disc DVD ten stars if I could.  The concert is amazing and begins with ten minutes of pure DRUMS!  The setlist is incredible, but Phil has so many wonderful songs that this concert (recorded in Paris, back in June of '04) could've been--should've been--four hours long, in an effort to get in every good song, but two hours and fifteen minutes isn't too bad.  If Phil's voice and physical energy would've held out, he and his awesome band could've performed 40-50 songs and nobody in that Paris audience would've batted an eye. <br />Two times during the concert Phil announced that this tour (2003-2004) will unfortunately be the last one and he received mixed reactions from the audience--cheering and booing. <br />For the past nearly forty years, Phil has worked hard in the music business (by himself, with Genesis and with \\"Brand X\\", along with his Big Band era), so he deserves to be able to retire while still at the top of his success.  Besides, back in December, his (third) wife Orianne gave him a new son, so the current generation of his family has become more important to him than fame and fortune. <br /> <br />This new dual-disc DVD also offers incredible bonus material, including music videos. <br /> <br />If you love Phil Collins, do not hesitate any longer--get a copy of this DVD!  I got mine yesterday at the nearest Barnes & Noble. <br />\\"Finally...The First Farewell\\" is an experience to be cherished and is a DVD that is worth every cent of its purchase price.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|In the 1960s a tradition started in the independent music world, and as the counterculture blossomed in this historic era, a new counterculture began- the counterculture of independent rock. Velvet Underground brought us something we never heard before, in the 70s David Bowie graced us with his genre-bending masterpieces, and in the 80s the Pixies brought dynamics to the forefront of indie rock, pioneering the entire rock music scene of the 90s. A reader might wonder why all of this is relevant to a music listener in the context of Arcade Fire, but their wondering could quite possibly be over after a listen to this Montreal band's debut, \\"Funeral\\". <br /> <br />In this writer's opinion, there are two basic formulas for a successful album, which may have many variations. The first would be to create a new sound, playing with the dynamics and texture of the music itself, making the \\"not possible\\", well, possible. The second is to combine the influences of the musicians at hand, creating a new beast. What Arcade Fire does is remarkable- they not only have their own dynamics to punctuate their melodic, cathartic work, but they employ remnants of past greats, blending both. <br /> <br />What makes Arcade Fire show flashes of brilliance is the execution of the above mentioned aspects of their work. This band understands melody, and the sheer melodic complexity matches the subject matter at hand, which deals with many romanticism themes, and as well with an introspective view on life through the eyes of a person entering the world of adulthood. <br /> <br />Intelligent, complex, and beautiful are three words that sum up this masterpiece, but this album has the feel that in ten years, maybe twenty, could be remembered as a past great.

B00000J7RZ|5.0|People look to books that address issues important to them. Everyone wants a book that relates to their own world view and literature that either reaffirms or extends that view; Everyone Poops by Taro Gomi is a perfect example of this.  <br /> <br />For a child nearing the age when he or she begins to become aware of and acquainted with his or her body and bodily functions, this book offers insight and a better understanding of a process that has become a foremost issue with which they are concerned, and to which they pay great attention. For a child, the potty-training process can be one of either great defiance or one of great achievement and accomplishment. This book illustrates to children that they are part of the natural rhythms of the universe and the overall normal order of things.  <br /> <br />The bright illustrations of fun and exotic animals as they pose with their excrement encourage the children that pooping is a matter of fact. Everyone Poops also has an underlying diversity theme illustrated by the emphasis placed on the different characters and their individual fecal matter. This sends the message that although all of our bodies are similar we also have individual variations, a theme that can be applied to other lessons that children will later learn.  <br /> <br />I chose to review this book because it brings to light an important and oddly taboo subject matter. I like this book because it encourages discussion of sanctioned, socially unacceptable subject matter. Simply put, everyone does poop. This book exemplifies how even the most natural of things and something so simple as to be the topic of a childrens book, has become distorted in our societys view. Everyone Poops has a multitude of applications reaching far beyond its intended audience.  <br /> <br />I should end by saying that I did wash my hands after reading the book.  <br /> <br />

F. Rischard [[ASIN:0465070108 High Noon 20 Global Problems, 20 Years to Solve Them]], or the more obvious Club of Rome and that Brown guy.  Indeed, for the general audience, J. F. Rischard remains the best overview and the best value.<br /><br />Having said that, I do not discourage the purchase and absorption of this book.  Much of it can be skipped through if you have read other books that do a better job on any individual item (to his credit, the author provides an excellent bibliographic review in his expanded notes section).  It is largely a kludge of the ideas and investigations of many others, but does--and this is why it gets four stars from me--pull together in one place, in a very interesting manner, a broad variety of investigations and conclusions.<br /><br />Here are the highlights that I found worthy of reflection:<br /><br />1)  Gives useful emphasis to the word \\"ecocide\\" while bringing forward excellent reviews of how \\"creeping normalcy\\" and \\"landscape amnesia\\" can undermine any perception of danger or urgency.<br /><br />2)  Summarizes, but not as elegantly as J. F. Rischard, 12 problems and a 5-point framework of contributing factors.<br /><br />3)  Focuses on big business as the core player that must reform, but also emphasizes that big business will not reform until the public lives up to its responsibility for changing the rules of the game and making green business profitable.<br /><br />4)  Provides an impressive, nuanced, and helpful view of China and non-traditional threats coming out of China, including invasive plant and animal species, and noxious gases leaving China with the winds.<br /><br />5)  Alarms regarding Australia, the English-speaking outpost in Asia, which appears much more fragile and vulnerable to collapse than generally appreciated.<br /><br />6)  Explores the destructive nature of religious values that cause deforestation or over-population or other ills that impact on the commons.<br /><br />7)  Bluntly relates environmental instability to political instability.  Max Manwaring does it better in his edited work \\"Environmental Security,\\" but for the general audience, these few pages are important.<br /><br />8)  Provides a concise and helpful thrashing of the 12 or so most common objections to being prudent about our environment.<br /><br />Deep inside this book, and finally summarized by the author, is a focus on the failure of decision making at all levels of society.  A failure to anticipate, a failure to perceive, a failure to attempt remediation, or even if attempted, a failure to achieve remediation, are all failures of each group and its leadership.<br /><br />The author ends thoughtfully by noting that resolution of our imbalances will come one way or the other.  The only choice we have is between peaceful planned sustainable changes, and catastrophic imposed \\"natural\\" corrections through war, famine, pestilence, and genocide.<br /><br />I am very glad to have purchased this book, and would note that it did not make the cut via online browsing, but when examined in an airport bookstore, was found, once in hand and on direct inspection, to be worth the price of purchase and the time to absorb.<br /><br />Edit of 20 Dec 07.In a larger s trategic context, what I do not see in this book is an emphasis on strategic culture or getting a grip on global reality.

B00008DDSC|1.0|Are you guys friends of the director or something?<br /><br />I'm sorry but this is truly one of the most unpleasant and disturbing movies I have ever watched.  I wish I could erase the memories of this movie from my mind, it was that bad.  Whenever I think of bad movies, this is the first movie that comes to mind.  It's sick, sadistic, about suicide, torture..  Words can't even begin to describe how disturbing and uncomfortable this film was.  This is definitely not meant to be a feel good movie.  One does not end up caring about any of the characters, because they're all so sick and twisted.  I'm deviating from all the reviewers here, but believe me, you'll thank me later.
B0006399FS|1.0|How can anyone say that this is a great album, well its alright, and defintiley not great and especially not great at all considering its by U2. <br /> <br />To start of with, the music just sounds thrown together and lacks any emotion or real feeling. <br />It sounds like an album thrown together in a few weeks to be totally honest with you - especially when you compare it to their much greater albums such as - \\"POP\\" \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"War\\" - their best three. <br /> <br />All That You Can't Leave Behind (their last album) was alright -well it was'nt their best album, and was defintitley far to mainstream and poppy at times - no - most of the time. <br />It was alright though. <br /> <br />This - no way - How to dismantle an atomic bomb (ridiculous title) may not of been made to sound like it - but it does sound like this album was made just to make money - and no album with a sound like that is good. <br /> <br />You'll be bored of it when you go back and listen to the other U2 albums. They could of done so much better.
B00006LPER|1.0|I watched this film a few years ago, and like The Secretary, it was a truly bad film. Sick and extremely disturbing, not to mention boring. I must've fell asleep 10 times while watching this film. I could've made a better movie. Not recommended.
B0006399FS|1.0|This overhyped album really sounds like a tweek songs from old u2 albums. Every songs sounds TOO familiar. They're given to much credit for nothing.  <br /> <br />U2 have been too pre-occupied with being \\"the biggest band in the world\\", has opposed to the best. The songs on 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' show that U2 are obsessed with getting their music onto US radio and making it grammy-worthy, and so a lot of the album comes over has bland and boring adult pop.  <br /> <br />Steve Lillywhites production is mostly horrible (as it usually is) - over-produced and over-the-top, particularly in potential classic 'Original of The Species' - it's layered with so many annoying strings and guitars it completely wrecks the song.  <br /> <br />All these people who are writing that this is \\"U2's best album since Achtung Baby\\" don't really know their music and seem a bit to easily satisfied. It's nowhere near their heyday of Pop or Achtung Baby. I would recommend that U2 take more time with their next album and worry more about artistic content than cheezy lyrics to sell albums to the twentysomethings.  <br /> <br />For those of you who were dissapointed by \\"All That You Cant Leave Behind\\" - like me - prepare to be majorly dissapointed by their latest effort.  <br /> <br />
B00030590I|3.0|The most startling thing about this movie is not the fact that it is a blend of an art-house drama and a rollicking kung fu movie, but that it so strongly promotes Chinese nationalism. Director Yimou stated that he wanted to make a modern myth for China, and boy did he ever. Beware of spoilers in the next few sentences: the plotline essentially justifies the violent imperialism of the king of Qin during China's warring states period. For example, we see the king's armies attacking a city with complete disregard as to who they kill, innocent civilians included. The \\"hero\\" of the story is attempting to assassinate the king, whose forces murdered his family. But in the end he has a change of heart. He realizes that the greater good is the good of the whole land, and lets the king live, since it is he and he only who can unite the warring kingdoms. Bring on the invasion of Taiwan! As a kung fu movie goes, it stands well above average in the capable hands of Yimou. The way he permeates each scene with a single color enhances the drama unfolding between the various characters, and of course the fight scenes are like nothing you've ever seen. It's not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, but Hero is far inferior to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  <br /> <br />
0393317552|5.0|Christopher Smith is incorrect in his description of Diamond's work. First, Diamond does NOT reject the influence of culture and human decisions on the fates of societies. This is discussed at length in the Epilogue.  <br /> <br />Second, and worse, is that clearly Smith either did not read the book carefully, or perhaps is overlaying his own preconceived notions on Diamond's theses. To wit, the example quoted regarding Sowell's work misses Diamond's point completely: trying to determine ultimate causes, not proximate ones. Why did the Europeans have interesting technology and ideas to exchange with each other in the first place? Simply put, you need an agrarian society with sufficient food surplus to promote specialization. Without that the mere presence of rivers is not magically going to result in technological innovation - and there are enough river systems in the Americas, for example, to counter such a hypothesis.  <br /> <br />Diamond's thesis might seem simplistic to some - to this reader, a scientist by persuasion, on the contrary it is a relief to finally see Occam's Razor being wielded with such precision on a topic much muddied by the social \\"scientists\\". The objections raised regarding \\"other factors\\" sound similar to those always raised whenever a clean, self-contained and coherent scientific theory has been presented - and not surprisingly it is usually the non-scientists who tend to disagree with such theories, pecking away at them with irrelevant \\"counter-examples\\". (Witness the whole evolution \\"controversy\\".) <br /> <br />What is perhaps most surprising about the negative reviews is the claim that Diamond's book is discounting the achievements of European civilisations - this misses the whole raison d'etre for the book: Why did European societies become and achieve what they did? What was the ULTIMATE cause since at one point in time clearly no particular group had much of an intrinsic advantage over the other? One explanation of course is geneticswhich seems to becoming more and more laughable as most of the West's universities, research institutes, and tech companies are being more and more manned by non-whites. (Maybe all the Chinese, Indians and other groups mutated in the last 30 years?) <br /> <br />My suggestion to readers reading these reviews is simple: keep asking WHY? For each of the putative refutations of Diamond's book, the question \\"but why?\\" can be rather illuminating. That is precisely what this book does.
0064409422|5.0|It has probably been twenty years since I first read this book, or at least since I first had it read to me by my parents. Since the big budget adaptation of the Lewis classic will be arriving in theaters next Christmas (finally), I thought I had better brush up on this and the other entries in his \\"Chronicles of Narnia.\\" I had forgotten how clearly this book presents the Gospel, considering, of course, that the reader understands the parallels between Aslan and Christ and between the \\"deep magic from the dawn of time\\" and the Law. It was in the theological and philosophical writings of Lewis that my young Christian mind first encountered a rigorous intellectual defense of the Christian faith. But Lewis knew that most people would rather read an entertaining novel than theological discourse.  The Chronicles, along with Lewis' other fiction writings, should stand as a model for the church today on how to integrate theology and imagination into a vehicle that both confronts and entertains the culture with the Christian message.  <br /> <br />
B00000JBFW|5.0|This is Deep Purple's (Mark II) 1984 reunion album, and an album that fans had been waiting for since 1973 (when the famous Mark II line-up broke up because of internal conflicts within the band). As most fans I was a little concerned. Many years had gone bye since their last album together, and music had changed over the years. Gillan had his own band, Ritchie and Roger were doing great with Rainbow and Jon Lord spent his \\"sparetime\\" in Whitesnake with David Coverdale. <br /> <br />Well, as this album shows there were no reason to worry about their ability to record a truly great album together. This is one of the few albums that I honestly can say that only contains great songs, and it has a lot of musical energy all the way through. The duelling soloes between Jon and Ritchie is way beyound great, and Roger's and little Ian's bass and drums keeps this train on the tracks. Big Ian's vocals are amazing (even though he can't scream as high as before- who needs screaming anyway?), and this album proves that he is one of the greatest rocksingers of all time. <br /> <br />Stand-out tracks: Well....in fact- all of them! <br /> <br />If you haven't got this album yet, it's your great loss! I suggest that you buy it:-)
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|I like my globe-trotting spy thrillers to be believable, and the Bourne series does better at this than most in the genre. Matt Damon is not a flashy, invincible action hero, and he puts a human face on a character who has such extraordinary abilities. There are a few moments when the believability is stretched a bit, but not nearly as far as in a James Bond movie. At best, Supremacy matches the original, and I hope they finish the series with \\"The Bourne Ultimatum. \\" <br /> <br />
0767834739|1.0|is it that hard to make a video game into a movie? resident evil should have been the perfect film series. the resident evil games have the following scary movie ingredients:a giant spooky mansion/zombies/zombie dogs/gore/mutated animals/evil dead style splatter combat/freakish characters/gore/gore/GORE!The first resident evil \\"film\\" was weak,at best.this one... is not has good.the very best thing about it is milla jovovich.she alone boosts this \\"film\\" to a watchable level.every other character is...whats lower than cardboard cut out? the nemesis is okay until that god awful hand to hand fight towards the end.and the zombie attacks are sad,they use this cheap camera trick to slow @ blur them,bad acting or bad makeup,the gory cheap flicks get that one right.and the cemetary sequence was just awful and didnt fit the \\"film\\".the editing was the worst i have ever seen,and why does the mpaa allow films like saving private ryan,black hawk down,and shindlers list to show what ever they want and get an \\"R\\" rating.those are real events and real people.these type of flicks,horror flicks are pure fantasy but you cant see a zombie chew on a guys guts unless its a unrated 20 year old romero film.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|This movie could have been twice as good in the hands of another director. Some of the lines are both written and delivered horribly, even by normally competent actors like Brad Pitt. I'm not extremely familiar with the story of The Iliad, so I can't really comment on all the changes to the plot. I know that the role of the Greek gods was almost completely excised, however, and thus Troy is a demythologization of Homer (in the same way that The Thirteenth Warrior is a demythologization of the \\"Beowulf\\" story). Some people hate this, but I think it works. In a movie version of this story, I would rather see what likely happened in the battle for Troy than Homer's souped-up version that has the gods flying around on the battlefield in their chariots like superheroes. Pitt portrays the man-killer Achilles and his thirst for glory well, but Eric Bana is even better as Hector. The battle between these two heroes and the events that follow are extremely powerful and heart-wrenching. The battle scenes are reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, but sometimes the cinematography is horrible. My wife noticed this also; needless to say, she is not someone who says the word \\"cinematography\\" often, so that's really saying something. But the strength of any movie is the characters and the plot, and by the end of this one I was hooked on both.  <br /> <br />
B00006879E|5.0|I just bought this C-D today and I love it.  I found out about Maroon 5 at the Grammy's.  I saw them preform \\"This Love\\" and I loved it!   <br />  Even my teacher recomended Maroon 5!  So I thought they must be very good- and they are. <br />  I would say if you are just begenning to know Maroon 5, this would be a great way to start.  I would also say that this is one of Maroon 5's gratest C-Ds! <br />  Here are my ratings for each song: <br />Harder To Breathe: 7/10 It's okay. <br />This Love: 10/10 I really like this song!  My favorite! <br />Shiver: 5/10 I didn't like it too much. <br />She Will Be Loved: 7/10 Okay... <br />Tangled: 6/10 It's good. <br />The Sun: 8/10 a very good song. <br />The rest I don't like too much; but it's all opinion. <br />I'd say that you should buy this C-D.  My ratings maybe not all that good, but it is very good, (my ratings are just tight!) <br />  I don't know why they called the C-D title \\"Songs About Jane,\\"  but it kinda makes sence because talks about her anger and her love. <br />  Buy this C-D anyway!   <br />
B00005JN0T|4.0|It is good to see that Will Smith can pick a blockbuster to star in that is smarter than the likes of Men in Black 2. Fans of Isaac Asimov, a pioneer of science fiction writing on robots, were disappointed with the film for not sticking closely to any one of his stories. I disagree entirely. Proyas and his screenwriter have taken the core element of Asimov's writing - the problems that creating a conscious, intelligent being would create for the world (and the being itself), and the famous \\"Three Laws of Robotics\\" - and used them as vehicles for a fun summer blockbuster. What you end up with is a summer movie that rises above the rest of the shallow, corn-popping action flicks that surround it. It is questionable whether or not humanity will ever be able to achieve the level of artificial intelligence that Asimov wrote about. But if we do, then his writings (and this movie) will suddenly become much more poignant, and it is almost certain that Asimov's three laws would be implemented to control the behaviors of those intelligences. Also, stuff blows up real good in this movie, and the robots jump around like superheroes.  <br /> <br />
B00000I41J|5.0|This album is a jazz classic and deservedly so. Only the title track lags a bit, but the others all soar. \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is a gem, and Cannonball's feature on \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" is magnificent: I've listened to that track at least a thousand times over the years, and everytime it moves me. A must-have CD.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have now seen this movie three times and cannot seem to get enough of it. I can't remember a time when I have felt so emotionally moved by something in the theater. I agree with  many of the other reviewers here, maybe the vocals are not laced with the experience of the stage production, but the depth of emotion and heartache conveyed by the characters, (especially the phantom) will take your breath away. I went down immediately and bought the soundtrack and that is all that has been playing in my car ever since.<br /><br />The second time I went, my fifteen year old son went with me. Now this is a typical, action-loving young man who goes to the movies to watch things blowing up. He said that from the moment the chandelier rose from the opera floor and the overture began playing, the hairs on his arms stood on end and stayed that way for most of the movie. I don't care what the critics say, that says something.<br /><br />I am trying to control myself, because I know I will be getting the DVD, but I will probably make it to the theater for a fourth helping of this musically majestic and visually enrapturing film. You just can't beat sitting in that dark theater with the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber pulsing through your veins to the beat of your heart.
B000002AGB|5.0|A superb archive 2-CD release that took me my complete surprise when I first discovered it. Some say it's a bit similar to the band's 'Live At Leeds' album which took place a short time prior to 'Live At The Isle Of Wight'. No matter, both are worth having. Sound mix couldn't be better. Total of thirty songs performed in nearly an unforgettable two hour set. Several cuts here I simply don't remember right off hand, like \\"Heaven And Hell\\", \\"Water\\", \\"Naked Eye\\" and \\"Fiddle About\\". Looks like pretty much most, if not all of 'Tommy' is played here. Cuts I enjoyed the most are \\"I Can't Explain\\", \\"Young Man Blues\\", \\"Amazing Journey\\", \\"The Acid Queen\\", \\"Shakin' All Over\\", the (always) awesome to hear \\"My Generation\\" and \\"Magic Bus\\". Comes with a twenty-page full (and I do mean FULL) color booklet packed with unseen photos, text and memorabilia. A must-have. Most highly recommended.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love the film!!! I've seen it three times and I can't wait for the DVD to be released.  Everything about the film is great.  The music is so haunting and the cast does a great job.  Gerald Butler is the best Phantom ever.  He portrays the part very well.  The Phantom is an insane murderer, but at the same time he has feelings.  The scene where the Phantom sees Christine and Raoul together singing \\"All I Ask Of You\\" is very touching.  To see him cry over Christine because he loves her so much is enough to make anyone cry, too.  I'm sure Gerald Butler has made every female who has seen the film fall in love with him.  He is indeed a very sexy and handsome Phantom compared to the others who have played the role (sorry guys).
B000002J3W|3.0|I've always been sort of a fair-weather fan of Skid Row. As this is their third effort, I've always liked 'Slave To The Grind' better than this or their self-titled debut. In all fairness, 'Subhuman Race' just might satisfy the really big-time Skid Row fans. Some of the tracks that I thought were decent include \\"Firesign\\", \\"My Enemy\\", the title cut \\"Subhuman Race\\", \\"Bonehead\\" and \\"Eileen\\" (perhaps the disc's best cut). Overall, a decent hair metal band CD.
B0006284JQ|2.0|Great compilation prize of her old baroque tunes mixed with her sassy harmony stylings (only paralleled by C-Pimp and J-Biz). Manheim Steamroller once wrote, \\"B Spears is like the most doughy thing since sliced bread.\\" I concur! Track 7 made my knees quake with emotional vibrations (high energy love oscillations, neo-Muon style). If you want powerful BGVs and sensual leads, look further. Spears lays down beats like a mahogany drum, and im caught in her voodoo trance.  <br /> <br />On the down side, the real down side that is. this is not family appropriate, on a scale of 1 to raunchy, i give it a 7.5 raunchquake. Word, though. She puts out on this new cut. Her neoprene background riffs lifted me out of cold depression. Buy it!
0679311726|5.0|The subtitle says it all:  The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda.  To call it anything less than that is a slap in the face to those who perished in the worst genocide since Pol Pot's &quot;Killing Fields&quot;.<br />Gen. Romeo Dallaire's book is a wake-up call to the fact we still haven't learned anything.  George Santayana, way back in 1905, warned the world that &quot;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&quot;  In excruciating detail, the general recounts one of the most harrowing experiences in recent memory and the fact that the world turned a completely blind eye to this latter-day Holocaust.  Surely, Dallaire suggests, the world should have known what was to come after the assassination which started the calamity.<br />By far the most chilling recollection is his conversation with someone who told him that it would take the deaths of at least 85,000 to even consider sending ONE peacekeeper from that country.  800,000 wound up dying.  To think that but for the presence of just 10 American soldiers the massacre could have been stopped is not only chilling but demonstrates the incredible amount of racism that still pervades some quarters within the US government -- and even the US media, which gave scant at best attention to this tragedy.<br />Dallaire concedes that the American serviceman who was killed in Mogadishu and dragged through the streets in the now infamous &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; incident a few months before may have given the Pentagon cold feet about Africa.  But the larger point he makes is this:  would the world reaction have been any different if Rwanda had oil, or gold, or some other exploitable non-renewable natural resource, rather than its most precious wonder (other than humans):  The still very threatened &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; for which Dian Fossey shed her blood more than a decade earlier?<br />Gen. Dallaire later relates how the severe depression he had afterwards from witnesses the carnage, and also from his failure to prevent the murders of 10 soliders under his command, nearly drove him to suicide.  He is now one of the world's most forceful advocates in international affairs, and this book is just the start of his new career in that direction.  &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; is definitely required reading for every world leader and anyone else who is still not convinced by Santayana's dictum or who could care less, just as their and our ancestors didn't give a damn during the Holocaust et sequens.
0679731725|5.0|I was lured into reading this book from the motion picture based on this novel starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.<br /><br />The author was born in Nagasaki and he has lived in England since he was 5 years old. Despite his specutacular achievement<br /><br />it never become huge news in Japan.<br /><br />Even though it is the story in England and narrates on the very British tradition and pride the Butlership, it reminds me of pure Japanese classics I can think of such as Mishima, Kawabata, and Natsume.<br /><br />Japanese literature is quite talented in such area of describing \\"unsaid intentions\\" as the fans of Yasujiro Ozu movies know really well. And we treasure some beauty facing diminision as our expression mono no awa-re implies.<br /><br />Ishiguro's novel aptly uses some of the key elements classic Japanese literature are well capable of. He is borrowing the theme from Mishima's \\"Confessions of a Mask\\", in which introvert author speaks about himself. In Remains of the Day Ishiguro let the old butler who is not supposed to disclose what he had been found during his servicemanship talk about his feelings and recollections.<br /><br />Recommended for wide variety of bookworms particularly Japanese classic literature appreciators.
B00008WT5C|5.0|AC/DC's best album with Bon Scott, what is it? Thats right, Let There Be Rock! AC/DC's Best album of all time? well maybe, I'm not sure if this is better then Back On Black or not, I'm kinda on the fence. Bon Scott's vocals sounded the best on this album. Some people will say High Voltage or Highway To Hell but trust me on this, Let There Be Rock has the greatest vocals that man ever recorded. And being in good classic AC/DC fashion the rythem section is tighter then any other bands. Oh, and lets not for get about the guitar duo of Malcome and Angus. This has the best guitar that the boys ever recorded, trust me if you ask any guitar player what the best AC/DC album is they will say....Let There Be Rock.<br /><br />The album opens up with 'Go Down' which after reading the reviews by other people I found that people were only giving it a 7 out of 10 but that so not true. You see this is one of the better songs on the album. The guitar riff is heavy and bluesy, it has a great groove and Bons vocal delivery are top notch, and the lyrics are great by any rock standards, this is a killer track. 'Dog Eat Dog' is next. Killer song. Classic AC/DC guitar licks, awesome solo and just a real bada** song to rock out to, easily one of the best songs on the album! Next is the title track, 'Let There Be Rock' and I mean what can you say about this song, other then its just damn amazing! The lyrics are so awesome that its not even funny and the way that the guitar and drums are almost insinc with each other is so awesome, this is straight up classic AC/DC! Let There Be Rock is probley the second best song on the album. 'Bad Boy Googie' oh man what a killer chorus! The lyrics are so powerful, they are perfect for Bons voice, and oh man the guitar riffs on this song are not for the weak, wanna talk about a power house, well thats what Angus is one this one! Next is 'Problem Child' which is pretty hard and heavy but kinda repetitive, but other then that this song rocks hard! 'Overdoese' has such a killer guitar section. I dont even know what to say about this one because I love it so much. I take it back Let There Be Rock is not the second best song on the album this little baby is! 'Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be' has cool riffs, a Cool beat, and pretty cool lyrics but its nothing way to special, but not bad by any means! The album closes with it's best song, and maybe AC/DC's all time best song, 'Whole Lotta Rosie' I love this song to death! It's damn amazing. The guitar riff is easily one of the 5 greatest guitar riffs ever, and the solo is the all time greatest guitar solo Angus Young has ever played! The lyrics are so cool, and so powerful, I swear I bought this album just for this song and then I found out all the other songs were great as well.<br /><br />To rap things up this is a power house of an album, not a weak track present on this one. The guitar playing is not to be matched and the vocals are so over the top that every thing just meshes together perfectly! Do your self a really really really big favor and pick up Let There Be Rock today!ese' has such a killer guitar section. I dont even know what to say about this one because I love it so much. I take it back Let There Be Rock is not the second best song on the album this little baby is! 'Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be' has cool riffs, a Cool beat, and pretty cool lyrics but its nothing way to special, but not bad by any means! The album closes with it's best song, and maybe AC/DC's all time best song, 'Whole Lotta Rosie' I love this song to death! It's damn amazing. The guitar riff is easily one of the 5 greatest guitar riffs ever, and the solo is the all time greatest guitar solo Angus Young has ever played! The lyrics are so cool, and so powerful, I swear I bought this album just for this song and then I found out all the other songs were great as well. <br /> <br />To rap things up this is a power house of an album, not a weak track present on this one. The guitar playing is not to be matched and the vocals are so over the top that every thing just meshes together perfectly! Do your self a really really really big favor and pick up Let There Be Rock today!
B00020HEG6|5.0|I loooove this soundtrack! I've listened to it end on end since I got it for my birthday back in September. It's awesome!! and I've got a new love for John Williams.
B000002P2W|4.0|The Who By Numbers isnt the best album The Who ever made but it's pretty damn good! Roger Daltrey's vocals are almost flawless, the rythem section of John Ensthwistle and Keith Moon is as always over the top, and Pete Townshends guitar playing was never better!<br /><br />The album opens with 'Slip Kid' which is a hard rock thats perfect for starting of the album. 'However Much I Booze' is a cool song that features Pete on vocals, this is a very fun song that your sure to love. The we go into the classic 'Squeeze Box' that has the humor that The Who were known for. I laughed so hard the first time I heard this song, it's awesome truly one of a kind. Next is the best song on the album 'Dreaming From The Waiste' which is in my openion one of The Who's all time best songs. It's a sexy/sleazy hard rocker that is sure to please, and Pete Townshends guitar playing really shines on this track! I really like 'Imagine a Man' it is a really beautiful man that almost reminds me of some of the material on Tommy. 'Success Story' is such a cool song, I used to close my eyes and listen to this and imagine myself up on stage playng some amazing guitar solo. 'They Are All In Love' is kinda cheesey and slow and somewhat stupid, its the only weak track on the album, but Rogers vocals are really really solid though. Im not sure what to say about 'Blue, Red, and Gray' its a really beautiful love song, I could listen to it over and over and over again. Easily the best ballad the band ever recorded. 'How Many Friends' is a heavy rockre with killer leads by Pete, and amazing ability to right compelling lyrics really comes through in this song. 'In a Hand Or A Face' closes the album and its the best song to do so, it has that classic harmony of voices that The Who were famous for and the vocals are amazing. Of all the songs on this album this one features the best guitar playing, just listen to Townshend play his riffs and leads! It was a sign of things to come from him.<br /><br />The Whos By Numbers is by no means in the same ball park or even league as Who's Next but it is still a great rock and roll record and any fan of The Who will love this record!Whos By Numbers is by no means in the same ball park or even league as Who's Next but it is still a great rock and roll record and any fan of The Who will love this record!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|Saw is a movie that starts out stylish and smart and gets silly and dumb before it ends. When watching the beginning and middle I thought \\"how could Richard Roeper call this one of the worse movies of 2004\\". Then as it gets closer to the end I thought \\"ok I get it now, that's why\\". Carey Elwes (Kiss the Girls) gives about the same bad performance that Kim Basinger did on Cellular. It's overly dramatic and just laughable. Still entertainly laughable at least.<br /><br />  Anyway the movie is about a killer who gets people to kill themselves trying to escape. They are people who have wanted to kill themselves and he gets them to fight to try to live. The movie is entertaining through-out even if it does lose it's touch a little at the end. It starts out as a good mystery/horror film and becomes just  laughably bad entertaining at the end.  Still it is a lot better than most recent horror films that came out recently.
B0006A9FKA|3.0|There will be unintentional spoilers periodically. <br /> <br /> <br />I'm the type of person who doesn't read movie reviews before I watch the film. I don't seek out trailers online, or read the latest dish on upcoming releases. I prefer to go into a film with a clean slate, knowing as little as possible about the film before I see it. I find the movie going experience more enjoyable when I have less pre-conceived conceptions about the movie I'm about to watch. That being said, I love to read reviews and seek out trivia about movies that I have already seen. I am addicted to the Internet Movie Data Base's Trivia section. I enjoy reading other peoples thoughts and ideas about a movie and compare them to my own. <br /> <br />Since living in France I have completely been out of the entertainment loop. We don't have a TV and it is rare that we go to a new movie. I do visit a few web sites to keep up with the news and hear bits and pieces of the movies that are coming and out and generating some buzz. Shaun of the Dead is a film that I have been hearing buzz about for several months. I refused to read any reviews or really research any aspect of the movie, but I couldn't help but hear bits and pieces of good things about. Primarily that it was a funny zombie spoof. Being a fan of the zombie genre, when the chance came up to borrow the dvd, I didn't hesitate to take it. <br /> <br />The plot is the pretty standard zombie plot. Some type of radiation/virus wreaks havoc on the earth re-animating the dead into brainless, homicidal maniacs. The movie does a good job of spoofing many of the conventions of the genre. The title character, Shaun, is so stuck in his hum drum existence it takes him a couple of days to realize that his city has been attacked by zombies. He has a dead end job, his girlfriend just broke up with him, and his flat mates are constantly fighting. Despite their being several zombies eating human flesh around him and the constant media blitz about them, itliterally takes a zombie in his back yard for Sean to notice. There are a number of truly funny scenes that mimic many of the classic zombie cliche's. <br /> <br />Here, the zombies walk in the classic, slow motion, brain dead way. They are mockingishly slow. In one scene Sean and his friend, Ed, throw a large crate full of junk at two zombies, then have time to run for a crate of records and argue which records are crappy enough to launch. The entire time the zombies are slowly walking towards them to devour Sean and his friend. Other scenes have one zombie being beaten with pool sticks repeatedly to little or no effect. Time and time again there are little digs at the genre conventions while still lovingly following them. <br /> <br />A quick perusal of IMDB's list of trivia for this film will show plenty of references to nearly every zombie film imaginable. I consider myself a fan of zombie films, but these guys must be nuts about them. They've set up multiple scenes that are exact homage to older films. They've lifted lines right out of the classics of the genre. I must say that while reading the list I became more impressed with what the filmmakers created with this picture, but while watching it most of the references went over my head. As I said, I like zombie movies. They're gorey, violent, bloody and often hilarious (intentional or otherwise). I have seen more than my fair share of good and awful zombie flicks. Yet here, most of the references were naught caught by me. I can't exactly fault a film for referencing so many other films, yet I have to wonder who but the diehard zombie fanatic caught them.  <br /> <br />My biggest complaint with the film is that it is too comedic, without being funny enough. What I mean by that is that the production is made like a comedy. The actors play their parts as if they are in a comedy and not the horrible zombie addled situation that is scripted. Sure, there are a few moments of anguished screaming and fear, but thoseare over acted and far between. The story is truly frightening, the dead of came to life and are devouring the city. This is not a light hearted romp. Though often quite funny, zombie films play the situation straight. I felt let down that everyone was playing the situation for gags and not allowing the comedy to be more organic, or to flow out of the conventions of the genre itself. In the end I didn't find the movie funny enough for all that. It was played for humor all the way through, yet I wasn't laughing nearly enough. Some of this comes from not getting all the \\"in\\" jokes. Some of this is also, likely enough, because it is a British comedy at heart. There are a number of bits that seem to play better for the British sensibilities than my American in France heart. There were several moments that I could see the joke play out and \\"get\\" it, but it wasn't enough to really make me laugh. This is not to say the movie isn't funny. Because it is, often hilarious even. It's just that the tone of the film was of great comedy, and the buzz I had heard matched this. Yet while watching it, I didn't find it as funny as expected.  <br /> <br />While thinking about this review I began to wonder how I would make a zombie spoof better. It wouldn't be right to go the Zucker brothers way. I got over that type of comedy in junior high, and the genre (well the horror genre which zombie movies are a sub-genre of) has been spoofed in this way enough (see Scary Movie). Slap stick spoofs were perfected by Sam Raimi in the Evil Dead series. In the end I decided that what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film is exactly the way to do it. I just think they missed the mark a little. I think I was partially disappointed because the genre itself has produced enough unintentional humor. Zombie movies are so often insanely bad, they are great fun. It is difficult to spoof a convention when the convention itself is so awful it seems a spoof unto itself. Likewise some of the conventions such as the ineptness and slow walk of the zombies has been revamped by the likes of Danny Boyle. Instead, here, I would have preferred a darker, bloodier movie. I don't believe this would have hurt the comedy. The references and homages could have stayed in tact and comedy could come out of horrific situations.  <br /> <br />Shaun of the Dead is a fine movie. It spoofs a genre of film that is dear to my heart, yet remains firmly a fan of the genre. It references so many of the classics and non classics of the genre that you'll need encyclopedic knowledge of zombies to catch them all. It is truly funny and makes a great party movie. Where it fails, it fails as a zombie movie. It is made for jokes and not scares, and there it falls a little flat for a good spoof. But certainly worth the price of the rental.  <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|4.0|I'm not usually the person that is into punk or rock music-- I'm more of a corny love song/Broadway Buff chick- but, a friend bought me this album as a present and since then I have become a huge fan of Green Day their music I think is something we can relate to our modern times and our own dreams and aspirations. I would have never believe that I would be saying this and I know it sounds corny but,it's inspirational-- if rock can be so- \\"Boulvard of Broken Dreams\\" is my personal favorite for I can relate to the disappointment of not having a dream come true and feeling as though your the only person who has not had their dream come true. \\"American Idoit\\" is also a favorite for me it's the song that all liberals can relate to. I can't say I'm a huge fan of \\"Jesus from Suberia\\" but, I usually skip through that track. The only question I have is why did it recieve the \\"explict\\" lyric content for I really didn't find anything very offensive or explict about it-- so parents I wouldn't worry it's not an Emminem or a Marylin Manson C.D.! Buy this one for your teen or pre-teen they'll love you for it!
B0000844IT|3.0|Army of Darkness is the third (and so far final) movie in the Evil Dead Series. Before director Sam Raimi went legits with a series of critically acclaimed dramas and the Spiderman series, he was a low budget horror genius. Army of Darkness begins right where Evil Dead II ended, with Bruce Campbell trapped in medieval times to battle the deadites once again. <br /> <br />The trilogy started out in Evil Dead as a pretty straight horror movie. A group of people discover a book of the dead and unleash gore filled horror upon themselves in a remote cabin. Evil Dead II basically re-tells the same story with a different cast (except for the ever present Bruce Campbell), bigger budget and plenty of slapstick. The second movie is by far my favorite in the series. It keeps the ghoulish gore while adding hilarious physical comedy and some classic one liners. Army of Darkness furthers this tradition by adding even more slap stick and one lines while removing almost all of the gore. <br /> <br />What little plot there is goes something like this: Stranded in the middle ages Bruce Campbell is at first captured by a small army for being mistaken for a member of a rival army. Bruce quickly uses his \\"boomstick\\" to gain clout with his captors and is sent on a quest to recover the Necronomicon which will both send Bruce back to his own time and save the army from evil. Bruce being Bruce he gets the book and unleashes an army of the dead. There are two endings released for this movie. One happier ending was released in US theatres and another sequel set up unhappy ending seen in a theatrical cut in the UK and on many US DVD versions. <br /> <br />Raimi once again does a nice job creating a mix of horror movie cliche's (which range from Jason and the Argonauts to Gulliver's Travels) with the slapstick of the Three Stooges. Unfortunately the comic elements seem to take over this picture leaving the horror end of it as more of a backdrop. It feels more like a Zucker brother's movie morethan a horror film. Most of the evil dead are formed as skeletons which only crumble when destroyed rather than burst into a mess of blood and guts as they did in the first two movies. This may seem to be an absurd complaint, but as a fan of gory movies I felt disappointed with that choice. <br /> <br />The cinematography is actually quite well done throughout most of the picture. My DVD copy is actually quite beautiful in scenes. Especially the exterior shots around the windmill. The use of color and lighting is well above par for most horror films. The pre CGI special effects effect the quality of the print in several areas, but still hold up as goofy Raimi effects. I kept thinking the picture was too pretty for what was actually taking place on screen. <br />Bruce Campbell once again does a nice job of making Ash come to life. He delivers his lines with the comic timing of a comedian while still delivering enough pain to make his albeit over-the-top beatings believable. The rest of the cast is hardly memorable as characters or for their acting. <br /> <br />Army of Darkness still makes a nice end to the trilogy. In a way it makes a nice bookend to Evil Dead's pure gore horror with the single middle book being a mix between bloody gore and slapstick comedy.
B00005MP58|3.0|O.K I am a huge Colin Firth fan and after seeing \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" I knew I had to buy this movie for I knew Colin would be the perfect Darcy and this was his break-out role.<br /><br />But, I found the movie rather dull and long focusing more on maintaining the story than, creating interesting dialouge or focusing on the passion between Darcy and Elizabeth. Colin is really the only one who delievers a good performances the rest of the cast I found rather boring and annoying except for Colin's close friend. I find myself straining to stay awake when I watch this DVD and I have started to just skip watching the first DVD and watch the second one instead where things begin to get interesting. I'll give it kudos for the set, costumes, and music but,all in all Colin Firth is the only reason worth watching this film!
B000025XKM|5.0|Words don't explain- one of the most artistic, pure, real works of art I've heard in my lifetime. Makes me cry each and every time. If you don't think this is what music should be like, you are dead inside.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|This movie in my opinon was the best movie of it's year and it's a tragic shame it didn't beat Lord of The Rings for the title with a great cast, beautiful script, and wonderful music this movie did not go wrong in any sense. Once again it's one of those Civil War movies that takes place in the South but, delievers a \\"anti-war\\" vibe from the dialouge and action squences-- perhaps because you see more losses than trimuphs.<br /><br />In the movie Nicole Kidman moves to Cold Mountain with her father who is a preacher... she quickly becomes the infatuation of a local boy Inman. Nicole and Inman quickly become attracted to eachother and with a couple of encounters they grow to love one another. When the war starts Inman quickly enlists to fight for the South leaving Nicole behind. When Nicole's father suddenly dies she finds herself alone fighting to survive with no life skills it's a real struggle for her-- she writes Inman and tells him \\"come back to me.\\" After recovering from a serious wound Inman makes the decision to try to go back to Cold Mountain encountering, whore houses, yankees, less than honorable chirstians, and a goat lady. But, deserters are being shot for desertion. Reese Witherspoon comes into the mix as the loud mouthed and strong willed Ruby who helps teach Nicole life skills. I won't give away the ending. But all in all this movie is about love, loss, faith, and the struggle when we're lost to come home to the ones we love.<br /><br />I'm not usually a Nicole Kidman fan and I didn't really like her Southern accent but, she did great as the spoiled preacher's daughter who finds herself alone after her father's death. Reese Witherspoon in my opinon did a lack lester performance as Ruby who helps Nicole learn how to survive on her own. Jude Law does a great job but, not good enough to win the Academy Award for best supporting actor. Great visual effects, stunning scenery, and well-written script make this movie sparkle.<br /><br />Only two things wrong with this movie are it's length and it's also one of those movies you can only enjoy once. All in all I highly recomend you rent this movie and pass around the tissues for this one is a tear-jerker!wrong with this movie are it's length and it's also one of those movies you can only enjoy once.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I am glad that Disney has decided to release this movie in Region 1, enabling me to view it on a Region 1 player.  I understand that Miyazaki initially began work as an animator in 1963 at Toei Animation and there met Isao Takahata (Anime Explosion, the What?Why? &Wow! of Japanese Animation, Drazen, Patrick, Stone Bridge Press, Berkeley, 2003).  Together, Miyazaki and Takahata with Yasuo Otsuka, made an animated feature, Prince of the Sun, Hol's Great Adventure (hint..hint... will someone release this on DVD? Will some anime festival please show this in the United States?).  Lupin III, Castle of Cagliostro was co-written and directed by Miyzaki for Toho Studios in 1979/1980.  However, I think it is safe to say that this is the first Ghibli Studio full-length movie.  But enough of history... <br /> <br />Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is my favorite Miyazaki film.  I am sure that other reviews will summarize the plot, so I will not discuss that in this review.  Instead, I will say that as in Princess Mononoke, there are strong ecological overtones and strong female roles in this film.  The Princess Nausicaa exhibits independence, intelligence, kindness, compassion, bravery and leadership.  Nausicaa has a strong interest in animals, including insects, which Miyazaki apparently cites as supported in Japanese folklore from a story from the twelve century collection entitled Tsutusmi Chunagon Monogatari (Drazen, 2003).  What more could one ask from a role model, let alone a female one.   <br />The animation is superb.  While perhaps a little simplistic, remember this is circa 1984, it is still very enjoyable.  The attention to detail, realism and color, stand the test of time and are watchable over and over again.  Miyazaki's flying machines, as in Castle in the Sky, are a treat. Another production note is that this movie marks the arrival of composer Joe Hisaishi who contributed the film score, the first of many Ghibli movies he scored (Drazen, 2003). <br /> <br />There is a plot.  There is a story.  There is character development.  Perhaps not enough plot twists.  Perhaps too predictable.  There is some violence.  This is a story of a prophecy.  This is a war story, a war between the animals (the Ohmu) and man, between men (the different nations), between loyalty to one's own values and one's homeland (Asbel).  It is a relatively complex story, animated or not.  I am only sad that, not knowing Japanese, I wonder if I am losing something in the translation and dependence on the whim of the dubbing script? (Drazen, 2003).  Sometimes the film might also appear a bit preachy.  However, despite these caveats, I think this film deserves status as an essential anime in any collection.  I am glad that Disney has finally released this for viewing in Region 1 (the United States).  At least we won't have to depend on Quinton Tarentino to force Disney's hand or watch an American reissue a la Shall We Dance or Point of No Return [La Femme Nikita].  Where can I get a stuffed Teto doll?  My Princess Nausicaa lunchbox...er.. bento box. <br />
B000002897|5.0|When you think of Washington bands, you think of Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, or Nirvana, but the one band you probably wouldn't list would be the Screaming Trees, which is sad, because this band was the Nirvana that never was. Screaming Trees [ST] have a unique 90's grunge/60's hippy sound that blends so perfectly together, to create this amazing upbeat feel-good rock vibe, and yet still have the powerful angst in there. For once it's nice to hear a band that isn't singing about how sad their lives are, and when ST does sing about it, it sounds great without the depressing feeling. Mark Lanegan has a very unique, brisk voice that manages to create that awesome sound of his music. It's a shame ST never scored it huge, but their hit \\"Nearly Lost You\\" will probably seal them immortality in the heavens of 90's rock. <br />
B0006SSOHC|4.0|\\"Saw\\" is the suspense horror film to buy on DVD for this first quarter of 2005. After hearing mixed opinions about the movie, I felt that there was only one thing to do, ..see the movie for myself. I wasn't among those that were disappointed. Although the acting was a bit rusted (not by all), it was easily tolerable. The film had plenty of suspense, chills, and thrills around every unexpected twist and turn. Sure, there are those who knew what was going to happen next, but did they really? I found the idea of the movie fresh. I welcomed each intense moment. I'm not much on breaking things down in a movie review. I just recommend them or not. In this case I recommend \\"Saw\\" to those who like well paced horror. However, if movies like \\"The Grudge\\" scare you. Avoid this and save money on a therapy  bill.
B00008OLIC|5.0|I think that Dr. Feelgood is one of the best albums by them.  They had a lot of high energy songs like the title track, Don't Go Away Mad, and others.  But the surprise here is the power ballad Without You, where the more musical talents of the band shine.  The sparse sound and the way the song sways keeps it from being too sappy.  The high point is the 100-miles an hour sound of Kickstart My Heart, easily the band's best song since the very first album's Too Fast For Love song.  Everything all clicks, from the high charged guitars to the big, dramatic, ending as Tommy Lee does cascades of drumming at the very end! There are shades of R&B and blues on some songs to match the band's rock edge. Nikki Sixx's songwriting is his best on here. This is a very dynamic effort from the band. Someone posted here that this was the band's \\"1984\\", regarding to Van Halen's huge album success with that album. For Motley, this album was their \\"Thriller\\" of all of their albums!!!!!
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is by far one of the most inventive, well-written, and cerebral films in recent history. The film, blending a well put together combination of dark visual style, intense plot development, and polished acting, remains tight and focused throughout, from beginning to end, never straying outwards into unimportant issues, or resorting to typical Hollywood clichs. Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher. <br /> <br />The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from \\"The Divine Comedy\\", sets out to, \\"preach\\" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them. Se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story, however, it quickly develops into of a sort of modern-myth, with good and evil taking centre stage. The story is original on all counts, and thrilling on all levels. The most important aspect of Se7en, however, is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story, as oppose to other thrillers, which become predictable and bland by the end. By keeping the audience in the dark, the film remains fresh and original as it progresses. Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved. By the film's conclusion, the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves, and arrive at Se7en's surprise ending without a single clue of it, prior to it occurring. Se7en's poetic ending(which will not be given away) says a lot for the people behind the movie, showing they are not afraid of going against the grain. A rarity with films so nowadays. <br /> <br />Directed brilliantly by David Fincher, and skillfully written by Andrew Kevin Walker, Se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever, making it one of the greatest films of the 90's. While Se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as Silence of the Lambs, Se7en is, undoubtedly, as influential as any film to date. <br /> <br />
0689865384|5.0|I picked up this book and liked the cover design, but thought the title was a little weird.  I bought it anyway and loved it at once.  It has an excellent plot line and cool characters.  I am dying to read the 2nd book in the trilogy.  Even though the main character is a girl, it isnt really a girly kind of book, because it has a lot of technology and wilderness stuff, so its the perfect book for anyone
0375422307|5.0|The revolution in Iran is something that few Americans understand.  This work provides a view of Iran that is highly accessible even to the most uneducated reader.  At the same time this should appeal to the expert for its frank and interesting depiction of everyday life in Iran.  Furthermore the author has taken a difficult topic but approached it in a light-hearted way that proves to be much more enjoyable and entertainable for the reader.  This work is certainly worth the short amount of time it will take you to read it.
0385510454|5.0|I have enjoyed very much The Broker. I believe this is a good book where you would spend a good time reading it. <br /> <br />First of all, I have to say that I enjoy Grisham's books very much. The Firm is one of my favorite books ever. I love his writing style very much. <br /> <br />I have also enjoyed reading A Painted House when it was released and this book was a main departure from his own writing style. I would say that The Brooker is the mix of both style. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is written in the same way A Painted House was. However the second half has all the elements of a thriller. I have enjoyed this book for Grisham's ability to mix both styles in this book. <br /> <br />However, if you are looking for a 100% thriller book, you will be very disappointed. If you did not like A Painted House, I would say that you will not enjoy this book at all. However, if you had enjoyed previous books from Grisham, you will like this one. <br /> <br />I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did. <br /> <br />Do
0385510454|5.0|I've read all of Grisham's novels.  Some are \\"great\\", some are \\"good\\" and some are \\"just okay.\\"  This is one of the \\"great\\" ones.  I couldn't put it down.  I'm not going to talk about the story, just suffice it to say that it's splendidly written and it's a page-turner.  Oh, and I didn't mind the Italian travelogue aspects at all.  Added to the book's charm, I guess.
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I was every bit as reluctant to love this CD as I was eager to embrace such would-be indie classics as Wilco's--well, there's no need to even cite it anymore, is there?--or the long- (and I do mean LOOOOOOOOONNNNG, to the tune of thirty-some odd years!) awaited release of Brian Wilson's uber-masterpiece \\"Smile\\", but the simple fact of the matter is that this modern-day epic (and let's just do the world a favor for now and forever and drop the term \\"punk\\"---PUH-leeeeeezzzee!!!!!!!!!!--when discussing this band, huh?) is everything and more that it's cracked up to be; even the most timely-placed of superlatives couldn't come close to describing it accurately, and yet, not since (in this reviewer's humble opinion, at any rate) the release of U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" has the use of superlatives been so richly warranted.  All one needs do is listen to \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" on more than one occasion (and preferably in a variety of moods and / or under the influence of this, that or the other thing) to acknowledge the aforementioned assertion as a mere statement of fact..and yeah, when speaking strictly of Billie Joe and Co., here one needs not refrain from employing the adjective \\"mature\\" both liberally and of necessity.  Touche, indeed...
B00005JM0B|4.0|Well, Here's the thing...I am someone who enjoyed this movie the second time I saw it. I first saw the film on HBO one night and didn't really enjoy it that much. I was a little confused and somewhat disturbed by the whole \\"End of the world\\" scenario and it also didn't help that I am not a big fan of the first 2 movies and had only seen each of those once before. The things I did like in this movie were the action sequences, which were very entertaining and kept the viewer on the edge of there seat. I also liked the whole odd chemistry that Katherine and John had through the film. It was kind of interesting seeing the two characters, who are brought together to make it to the future, deal with learning they are going to one day be married and lead a revolution against the machines that will end the world. There are things that confuse me about the series that I still would love some clarification on, such as, since John's father, Kyle, was from the future, where is he in the whole apocolypse scenario? Would he even be alive or was he born after the apocolypse? How come the terminatrix never goes after him because if he doesn't survive then John could never be conceived, right? It's all a little confusing to me, but I still liked the movie and disagree with what some of the reviewers are saying. Also, some people are saying that Edward Furlong was an amazing and much more emotive \\"John\\" but Edward Furlong was about 12 years old when he played that role and I don't think it really mattered that Edward didn't reprise the role since he is a completely different man now and would probably not bring that same spunk to the character. Nick Stahl did a fair job, although at times he comes off a little stiff and wooden with his lines. Claire Danes is one of my favorite actresses but I felt like some of her lines in this movie were also a tiny bit under-acted. The moment when John pulls the gun out and tells the Terminator that he is going to kill himself and she looks over at him and says, OH JOHN!...That is one of the worst delivered movie lines ever. Overall though, the movie is what it is, a good action movie. For die hard fans, there could be some plot problems or casting upsets, but I still would recomend the movie to people who want to see a good action flick.him and says, OH JOHN!...That is one of the worst delivered movie lines ever.

B0000C8AVX|5.0|\\"Bring It All Back Home\\" is one of Bob Dylan's best records. I bought this after I had already bought four of his other albums, and the only one that I think is better that this is \\"Blonde On Blonde.\\" There's just a different feeling and sound in this album than there were in the other ones. It's less folk and more rock and country, especially the first half. Songs like, \\"Tambourine Man\\" and \\"Gates Of Eden,\\" however, still show Dylan's folk roots. From the first song, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" though, I knew that this album was going to be amazing, and it never disappointed me.   <br /> <br />It's hard to choose certain songs that stand out of this album because they're all good. My favorites would probably be \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" \\"Maggie's Farm,\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.\\"
B000001ELR|5.0|In the early 80s, KISS was in trouble. After a string of classic hard-rocking albums, the band started to change direction and follow a disco path with Dynasty and Unmasked (the former being excellent and the latter not being up-to-par). Their troubles were confounded by tensions with drummer Peter Criss and he did not play on either album (although he is credited). Criss was soon replaced by the very talented Eric Carr. KISS next tried its hand in making a concept album with 1981s \\"Music From The Elder.\\" Although this album was interesting and adventurous, it didn't click with the fans and was an almighty flop. \\"Killers,\\" a greatest hits album was released the following year with four new rockers, in an attempt by the band and its label to regain  some credibility and popularity.<br /><br />1982s \\"Creatures of the Night\\" was going the be the bands make-it-or-break-it album. Although Ace Frehley is depicted on the cover, he neither wrote for, nor played on the album. This album actually has a few people stepping in for Ace Frehley--Steve Ferris, Bob Kullick, and most importantly Vinnie Vincent.<br /><br />This album was a true return to form for the band. After a lack of focus, they came back with their finest album since \\"Love Gun\\" (1977). The band sounds superb. Simmons and Stanley sound committed, as if they wanted to prove that they still had it in them to rock. Although a few different guitar players stepped in for Ace, the band sounds very cohesive. Eric Carr really shines and his drumming is intense. His playing was more proficient and superior to Criss. His drumming gives the album a real shot of adrenaline. And although Ace Frehley was a huge part of the band, surprisingly, his presence is not really missed. The guitar playing by Steve Ferris, Bob Kullick and Vinnie Vincent is superb. Vincent soon became Ace Frehley's permanent replacement.<br /><br />The songs on this album are all excellent. This is probably the most heavy KISS album in their catalogue. All rockers, with only one balled, the beautiful \\"I Still Love You.\\" It was Simmons and Stanley's best work in years. Vinnie Vincent also co-wrote three of the songs and proved to be a good writing partner. There are no filler songs here. Every song is a winner. The album opens with the classic title song. It has a killer riff and awesome solo by Ferris. The album never looses momentum, it has one killer song after another. Other standouts include \\"Rock and Roll Hell,\\" \\"I Love it Loud\\" \\"I Still Love You,\\" and \\"War Machine.\\"<br /><br />KISS attempted to regain focus, credibility, and popularity with this album. Although the album was not a huge hit at the time of its release, they mostly succeeded in achieving their goals. The band was reborn with this album and used it as a springboard to regain popularity with a sting of platinum albums in the 1980s. This album was also the end of an era, as it was the last KISS album to feature the band in makeup.<br /><br />This is probably the best post Criss/Freley KISS album. If you are starting to build a KISS collection--this is one of the first albums to buy--along with ALIVE, KISS, Destroyer, and Love Gun.one balled, the beautiful \\"I Still Love You.\\" It was Simmons and Stanley's best work in years.

B000002UD0|5.0|Most critics seem to agree that \\"Walls and Bridges\\" is Lennon's second weakest album, right after \\"Sometime In New York City.\\" It's been criticized as being unfocused and having filler. Although most critics will grant that the album does have some redeeming qualities and a few good songs. I strongly disagree with what most critics say about this album. In my opinion, \\"Wall and Bridges\\" stands alongside \\"Plastic Ono Band,\\" and \\"Imagine\\" as being some of the best music Lennon ever recorded. I would even put \\"Walls and Bridges\\" right alongside Led Zeppelin's \\"Zoso\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" as one of the best albums of the 1970s. This album does have its flaws. There is some filler, the production is a bit stuffy and it sounds a bit dated. However, I find that these flaws enhance its overall charm.<br /><br />John Lennon's music has often been autobiographical. This album shows that as much as any other album he recorded. At the time, Lennon was a man in pain. He was separated from Yoko and unsure of what to do or where he wanted to go. He indulged in drinking and heavy partying in the infamous \\"Lost Weekend.\\" This album is not a catharsis of raw emotion like \\"The Plastic Ono Band.\\" This album is more like a diary from a dark period in a mans life. It's not so much a cry for help, but more of an album of resignation and defeat.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Down On Love\\" a mid-tempo song about falling to pieces. In his delivery, Lennon sounds as though he is pleading for help, but he also sounds dejected. \\"Whatever Get You Through the Night\\" is one of Lennon's biggest solo hits. A great catchy duet with Elton John. \\"Old Dirt Road\\" is a beautiful balled about being lost. \\"What you Got\\" is not one of the album's strongest tracks. It's just a sort of sloppy rocker, but it adds to the album's overall charm. \\"Bless You\\" another beautiful balled in the vein of \\"Imagine.\\" \\"Scared\\" is a cool mid-tempo song whose meaning is self-explanatory. But in his singing, the song sounds as though Lennon really is scared--it sounds lived in. When he's yelling that he's scared, you can feel the mans torment. \\"Scared\\" runs perfectly into \\"#-9 Dream\\" a lush, pop-savvy mid-tempo rocker with cool cellos. \\"Surprise, Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradise)\\" is another filler song--not great, not bad--just filler. The album would have been slightly better without its inclusion. \\"Steel and Glass\\" is the follow-up to \\"How Do You Sleep at Night.\\" The contrast of it's raw, angry delivery with the lush music sounds great and enhances the song. \\"Beef Jerky\\" is a cool jam instrumental. \\"Nobody Loves You (When Your Down and Out)\\" is a depressing song about looking at life straight in the eye when you are lonely and dejected. \\"Ya Ya\\" is a filler sound byte, with Lennon's son, Julian on drums. It's a cool way to end the album.inging, the song sounds as though Lennon really is scared--it sounds lived in.

B000002KHB|5.0|Let me just start off this review by saying this...few albums can even hold a candle to \\"Machine Head.\\" When I picked this up, basically all I knew of Deep Purple was \\"Smoke on the Water,\\" which I thought might have been one of mankind's greatest creations ever. To put in perspective how good this album is...out of the 7 songs on this album, I would rank \\"Smoke...\\" 5th, or maybe 6th. (It tops \\"Maybe I'm a Leo\\" and possibly \\"Pictures of Home\\" - depending on how I feel.) This album is just good in a way I never expected it to be. I'd read dozens of great reviews of it and finally picked it up a couple of months back. Immediately, I wondered why I'd waited this long. We get the stunning opener \\"Highway Star\\" (with that killer keyboard solo) and continues furiously on through to \\"Space Truckin'\\". I would rank this album as my 2nd favorite album of all time. (behind AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\") \\"Machine Head\\" is one of those rare gems, a true masterpiece of the genre and an essential for all rock fans in general. Buy it! Now!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain has always been one of my favourite artists. No one in Britain (including myself) really knew who she was until she released the international version of the now-classic \\"That Don't Impress Me Much\\" in May 1999, but since then she has gone on to become of our country's best loved singers. Shania is the artist who single-handily perfected the pop/country crossover. And it was a perfect crossover: her third album \\"Come On Over\\" was released in late 1997 and by early 2000 had sold a staggering 36 million copies worldwide to become the biggest selling album by a female recording artist in history. This album is still a huge seller and will no doubt cross the 40 million sales mark over the next few years. As an album it has classic status in the industry, and this fact alone will keep it selling for years.<br /><br />It's rather unusual to see Shania as the world's biggest selling female artist, but that's pretty much what she is. She's not just a singer, but a remarkable entertainer as well. If you didn't know your facts you'd probably say Madonna or Mariah Carey had the biggest selling female album ever, but nope, Shania does! The reason for this is that she appeals to such a wide audience: kids, adults and even grandparents. She's one of America's sweethearts in that she's not going to release an inaccessible alternative record or let her boob 'accidentally' fall out on stage, and I think if the artist is honest about that then they deserve respect.<br /><br /> Shania and her husband write simple pop songs with catchy hooks and foot-tapping melodies and they don't pretend to be anything else. This has led a lot of critics to dismiss Shania's music as simply elevator music, and maybe it is, but so what? I for one love intelligent and thought-provoking music, but too much is never good. You have to have variety! That's where an artist like Shania steps in. So if you're looking for a great hits album with light pop music that doesn't weigh heavy on the cerebral cortex, then Shania's \\"Greatest Hits\\" is a must-own.<br /><br />The material on the album is arranged by studio album, with a chunk of songs from one album filling the first few tracks, then the singles from another album following this, and so on. Shania's 2002 album Up! is the focus of this album's first three tracks. \\"Forever And For Always,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good\\" and \\"Up!\\" are the first three tracks and were all pretty big worldwide hits. Then we get the selection of Shania's biggest hits, all from the Come On Over album. There are a total of eight songs here from that mammoth album, and they are \\"Come On Over,\\" \\"Man! I Feel Like A Woman!\\" That Don't Impress Me Much,\\" \\"From This Moment On,\\" \\"Honey, I'm Home,\\" \\"You're Still The One,\\" \\"Don't Be Stupid\\" and \\"Love Gets Me Every Time.\\" The reason so many songs were released from this album is that certain songs were released in certain countries, such was the universal appeal of this album. I personally love all of them. The reason for me buying this album comes next, and in the form of the six singles from the album \\"The Woman In Me.\\" This was Shania's 1995 hit album and the songs from it on this hits collection are \\"No One Needs To Know,\\" \\"You Win My Love,\\" \\"I'm Outta Here,\\" \\"The Woman In Me,\\" \\"Any Man Of Mine\\" and \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\\" These songs definitely possess a more country feel to them, as Shania gradually broke away from the country sound with each studio album.<br /><br />There are also four brand new songs on this album, in the form of \\"Party For Two\\" with Mark McGrath, \\"Don't!\\" \\"Party For Two\\" with Billy Currington and \\"I Ain't No Quitter.\\" I'm not really fond of these new tracks, probably because I've become so accustomed to the real classics on this album. However, they make for a nice addition.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Shania's Greatest Hits was a worthy purchase for me, as European fans will probably only have the International release of Come On Over whichcame out in 1999. The US version of the album is more country-fied than the European version, so for me to hear some of the songs from that album in their original format was interesting. However, I think I prefer the International versions. Also, a lot of the songs have been edited which was obviously so that the record company could fit more songs onto the album (every album has an 80-minute maximum playing time). The inlay of the album could also have had more pages with more pictures of Shania, along with a Thank You list. However, when you look at the superb hits on this album, you realise it's not just a quick cash-in, and more of a celebration of one artist's tremendous success in the music industry.Over which came out in 1999.

B000002513|5.0|At this point, the-man-who-would-become-Boss, was still in his wordy (sometimes overly so), desperate-streetlife-serenader stage.  \\"Born to Run\\" was just around the corner and the reasons \\"this town rips the bones from your back\\" and \\"we gotta get out while we're young,\\" contune to be made clear on this psudo-sequel to his \\"Greetings From Asbury Park\\" debut.      As with the Dylans and Billy Joels of the time, Springsteen has fashioned an entire album of songs that are each small character-driven epics.  \\"Rosalita\\" is the best-known of the bunch, and probably deserves to be.  It is one of Bruce's five or ten best songs; fun, romantic, and desperate all at once.      A lot of people also mention \\"Sandy,\\" but I think the real gem here is \\"Kitty's Back,\\" a mean piece of blistering blues that, to this point, was Springsteen's most advanced sounding piece of music; a sign of the musician to come on \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Darkness On the Edge Of Town.\\"  Nothing else on \\"Greetings\\" or this album is like it musically.  Single- handedly, \\"Kitty\\" thrusts Bruce into a new era as, at this moment, his sound becomes bigger, his vocals begin approching the stronger, louder Boss we know today, and, not to be out done, the E-Street Band begins to fight back with their own soon-to-be-legendary bravado.      This album and \\"Greetings\\" are two masterpieces of a work in progress; someone finding their niche, and their true voice.  Bruce has never really sounded like this again.  The songs endure because they are well-written and emotionally explosive.  But when he plays them today they are now played as if they came off later albums, with a sound more akin to the likes of \\"Born\\" and \\"Darkness.\\"  Nowadays Bruce yells and growls tunes like \\"Lost In the Flood\\" and \\"Spirit In the Night.\\"  The soft-talk and whispers are all but reserved for acoustic performances.  And as live performances go, his songs are probably better for the shot of emotional energy (its hard not to see \\"Lost In the Flood\\"on the New York DVD and think that's the way the song should have sounded).  But in the stereo, its hard not to to be touched by everyone of these songs just as they are.
B000000H5K|5.0|That's right. You heard me correctly, this is the worst Max Cavalera-era album and it gets 4.5 stars. Not nearly as good as \\"Beneath The Remains\\", a little worse than \\"Chaos AD\\", but when comparing it to \\"Arise\\", well...let's leave it at that. But the album is still good. The album starts out with \\"Roots Bloody Roots\\". It starts with a 5 second intro of insect noises than becomes a heavy song. It's one of the best on the CD. The next song, Attitude, is hands down the bets song on the album. It starts with a sitar intro and becomes one of the heaviest songs on the album. I LOVE the lyrics (\\"What were you thinking/What a wonderful world/You're full of s***!\\"). Other great songs include \\"Cut-Throat\\", \\"Rattamahatta\\" (with KoRn drummer David Silveria on additional percussion), \\"Lookaway\\" (With Korn vocalist/bagpiper Jonathan Davis and Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton on guest vocals), \\"Jasco\\", and \\"Directorsh*t\\". Overall, a good CD to own, but if you're new, I recommend picking up \\"Arise\\".<br /><br />Track ratings:<br /><br />1. Roots Bloody Roots 5/5<br /><br />2. Attitude 10/5<br /><br />3. Cut-Throat 5/5<br /><br />4. Ratamahatta 5/5<br /><br />5. Breed Apart 5/5<br /><br />6. Straighthate 5/5<br /><br />7. Spit 5/5<br /><br />8. Lookaway 6/5<br /><br />9. Dusted 4/5<br /><br />10.

B00005JMJG|5.0|I really have to get out more because I wasn't even familiar with this film until about a month ago, when one of my friends told me how good it was and said it was probably the type of film I would like. I've never been a big fan of Jim Carrey's movies, so I held off watching it for a few weeks - only to learn that my friend was right on target with her recommendation to me. I can't imagine how this incredible motion picture experience escaped my attention for so long. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is just incredible, the kind of film that renews one's faith in motion pictures. Every time I think Hollywood's last glowing embers of originality and intellectual beauty have been snuffed out by an endless rehashing of uninspired sequels and re-makes, a film like this comes out and blows me away. Let me be perfectly clear: I absolutely love this movie.<br /><br />Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind isn't your typical Hollywood faire. It's a complex film that some will undoubtedly find confusing, and that's okay. For those who love a deep, multi-layered, challenging motion picture presented in an ingenious, somewhat risky manner, though, this film is something to shout about. This is a romance, a drama, a comedy, and a marginal science fiction (concept-wise, anyway) film all rolled into one exquisite ball that can leave you laughing one minute, crying the next, and tossing and turning all night trying to push the story out of your mind long enough for you to fall asleep.<br /><br />To succeed, this film had to have great performances by all of the main characters - and it did. Jim Carrey was amazing; I'm not a big fan of his over-the-top comedic films, and I wasn't sure he could pull off a role such as that of the shy, quiet, introspective Joel Barish - he definitely surprised me here. Kate Winslet made the movie for me, though; she is simply enchanting as the quirky and delightfully spontaneous Clementine Kruczynksi. Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, and others turned in solid performances in the form of secondary characters, but this film is really all about Joel and Clementine.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the unusual but definitely heart-warming romance of our two charmingly unique lovers and their subsequent decisions to have each other erased from their memories. Joel wakes up one day and finds Clem gone from his life; she truly doesn't even know him anymore. Naturally, this would devastate and confuse any man; when he finds out she had him erased from her memories, he naturally decides to do the same thing rather than live with the pain of losing her. As he begins reliving the memories as they are erased, though, he realizes that a lot of wonderful memories are being taken away from him. Helpless to stop the procedure, he fights as hard as he can to keep Clem in his heart and mind.<br /><br />I've just described the movie, but I really haven't described it at all - not by a long shot. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the kind of film that defies description. You really have to experience it for yourself - and I would encourage you to do so. This is truly one of the most memorable, exquisite, touching films to come along in a long, long time.formances in the form of secondary characters, but this film is really all about Joel and Clementine.

B00005UKKF|5.0|I was not a fan of Britney Spears before I saw this show on November 2001 on HBO. I had lived in Las Vegas, NV and moved out of there that summer. On Thanks Giving Day, while the rest of my family was getting ready and leaving to another family member's house to celebrate Thanks Giving Day, I stayed at home to get ready. It was late and so I turned on the TV, it always makes me feel better, well it was on HBO when Britney's show was going on. It was live from Las Vegas and it catched my eye, since I had lived there. I decided to give the show a couple of minutes to see what was going on and then I would head to the shower. But I didnt I was hocked by her performance! she was so energetic and there was so much going on, from cips of her band to her big screen presentation. Then she would be singing all of these songs and change clothes very fast. She would be flying in the air and dancing and well she was and still is VERY HOT! <br />Well it was this show that made me want to see more of Britney, it made me notice that she was not only a singer but a performer too.  <br /> <br />Ever since I've been wanting to go to one of her concerts but I sadly miss her last one. I foudn out that it was going to be shown on MTV but I had to work duirng the airing dates of the show. I can't wait till they turn it into a DVD for me to see.

B0000035E7|1.0|Boring, dull, and without any personality to speak of, Nirvana's debut is not worth owning. Every song has drifts unnoticeably into the background. It's basically white noise. The vocals are dull, and there is nothing even remotely off-kilter or creative to be found. No interesting song topics, no insightful revelations, no personal spin on the lyrics. Nothing on Bleach will make you think. Nirvana is not a \\"thinking man's band\\" like many wish they were (unless the lyrics \\"cross says floss/smell the smell\\" are too high-brow for you). <br /> <br />A melange of records to buy instead of a Nirvana album: <br /> <br />Beck: \\"Mellow Gold\\" <br />REM: \\"Document\\" <br />Smashing Pumpkins: \\"Mellon Colliie\\" <br />Spin Doctors: \\"You've Got to Believe in Something\\" <br />The Offspring: S/T, \\"Ignition, and \\"Smash\\" <br />Oasis \\"What's the Story\\" <br />

B0002G2B2M|5.0|OK, another movie about how powerful love is and what it can overcome, and a movie so disjointed, a reasonable viewer can't figure out what is really going on. What to do?<br /><br />Well, if the movie grabs you in any way, watch it again, and if it grabs you some more, watch it once more.<br /><br />For me, it was the opening 20 minutes or so, which grabbed me. Such a bizarre couple, but with a special chemistry that made me want to learn as much about them as I could. Plus, the photography, bits of music, etc., were also inviting in those minutes.  So, I was willing to see the film through, even though at times it tried to lose me.<br /><br />After seeing it the first time, I might have given it 2 1/2 stars or so. However, I still had a desire to see it again, now that I could revisit scenes with a better understanding and from different viewpoints.<br /><br />So, the second viewing really did hook me, now that the plot was clearer. Two people, so different and so flawed, yet finding that special bond, with the unconscious figuring out things that somehow eluded the conscious. I personally can relate to that, remembering I had a dream once, where, in the dream I actually recognized that I was in a dream, so that my unconscious was indeed plugged directly into my conscious.<br /><br />I have always questioned how in a two minute conversation, talk show pseudo-therapists can tell a caller to drop a deeply flawed mate. Aren't even the deeply flawed, allowed to experience love? Of course they are, and this film really does capture that.<br /><br />Someone commented in their review that there were no words worthy to remember from the film, however, I will never see the word, \\"nice,\\" in quite the same way again.<br /><br />Without the performances from Carrey and Winslet and the chemistry they generated, this film likely would not have succeeded in capturing the power of love in quite the way it did. I give it five stars.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|The Rainbow Children, the first cd by the newly rechristened Prince, wears a sticker that proclaims \\"The controversial new album by Prince.\\" Upon listening and discussing with fellow fans, the controversy arises not from the religious concepts discussed within the album, but whether the \\"Darth Vadar voice\\" ruins the record or not. For me the answer is \\"no.\\"<br /><br />Taking us back to 1982's \\"1999,\\" this album begins with Prince speaking in an altered voice, proclaiming \\"For the accurate understanding of God & his law...\\" Well, he might have used his regular voice if he wanted accurate understanding. But what strikes you is the music, which sounds nothing like anything Prince has ever done before.<br /><br />What I noticed first are the real drums, always a welcome addition to Prince's music. Then we notice the jazzy feel, flirted with on many an occasion, but never so fully embraced. Then we notice the absence of any pandering to pop trends, which had been an unfortunate trend in Prince's own music since 1991's Diamonds & Pearls.<br /><br />Many fans of Prince will be disappointed by the lack of cursing, sex talk, or simple songs. But what made Prince the legend he is today is his ability to surprise, and his willingness to take chances. The Rainbow Children shows that that spirit has not died in Prince, which is something his previous few albums were not able to do.<br /><br />The title track, Everywhere, 1+1+1 is 3, The Sensual Everafter, Mello, Family Name, Everlasting Now, and Last December are all songs that quite simply could not have been accomplished by any other musician. Playing virtually every instrument except the drums, Prince shows what a truly professional pop musician is capable of, and what seperates him from peers such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, or (yech) Usher. He takes music to heights that only the true greats can reach.<br /><br />But to many, this album is narrated with a weird voice, so it's no good. It shows the unfortunate state of popular music that it took a far inferior but much more accessable album, \\"Musicology,\\" to reaffirm Prince as a force in music.ate of popular music that it took a far inferior but much more accessable album, \\"Musicology,\\" to reaffirm Prince as a force in music.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I was introduced to actor Tom Cruise when he costarred as David Shawn, a gung-ho red beret in the film TAPS. The film also featured up and coming actors Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn with film veteran George C. Scott as the Commandant of Bunker Hill Military Academy. I've been a huge fan of Cruise ever since I saw that 1981 film.<br /><br />About a month or so prior to the release of Interview with a Vampire, a coworker told me the film was a best-selling Anne Rice Novel. After learning this, I borrowed the dramatized audio version from my local library to get the extra details I knew the film would leave out. If I could only use two words to describe my experience they would be BLOWN AWAY!<br /><br />In fact, I was so taken in by the dramatized audio version of the book that I knew there was no way the Warner Brothers film could capture the essence of what I had already experienced. But, since I'm such a big fan of Cruise, I plunked down my hard earned greenbacks like everyone else, expecting a mediocre visual experience at best.<br /><br />Could Cruise become the Vampire Lestat I had experienced? Could new comer Brad Pitt actually become Louis? And what of Claudia? How in the world could a young Kirsten Dunst ever hope to pull off such a well defined character?<br /><br />Well, not only did Cruise bring to life the Vampire Lestat, but Pitt and Dunst were equally enthralling in their roles as well. The casting was flawless. This is one to see as director Neil Jordan did an excellent job of bringing the pages of the best-seller to the big screen.<br /><br />The 1994 film was shot on location in New Orleans, San Francisco, England, Paris, and also offers excellent performances from Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea, Christian Slater, and new comer, Thandie Newton, who later starred opposite cruise in Mission Impossible 2.<br /><br />This film has everything: love, hate, life, death, ecstasy, terror, and murder. Check this one out, y'all! If you've already seen it, see again, or get the audio version and get a different experience. You won't be disappointed.y seen it, see again, or get the audio version and get a different experience. You won't be disappointed.  <br />
B0001UL7RY|1.0|This CD is very boring.  Its a good CD if you want to fall a sleep. <br />These songs are dull and lack character.
B000002KDS|5.0|Let's face it - Alice had issues. Thank God. If he didn't, we would never have been given this string of wonderfully off center masterpieces. <br />There have never been any songs like \\"Halo of Flies\\" or \\"Dead Babies\\" in rock music. Only the original Alice could have gotten away with such insanity. Again, the thing that put Alice over was the humour. Everything on this disc is served up with an evil grin. Delicious. Classic.
B0002XDODU|3.0|I was going to write an overall negative review of this CD but when I started playing tunes to rip on I realized there are SOME pretty good songs on it. Unfortunately, there are some real lame ones too! What's with \\"Ohne Dich\\" and \\"Amour\\"? Trying to show their tender sides or just filler? \\"Stein um Stein\\" just isn't very good. \\"Amerika\\" is somewhat catchy but then becomes tedious. \\"Moskau\\" reminded me of a '70's punk song called \\"Disco in Moscow\\" by The Vibrators - only the Vibrators' version is better. \\"Reise, Reise\\" just just doesn't do it and neither does \\"Mogenstern\\".   That brings me to \\"Mein Teil\\". This is what Ramstein is all about! \\"You are what you eat!\\" \\"Dalai Lama\\" is a nice change of pace - still menacing though. That leaves us with the two best tracks on the \\"keine Lust\\" (Don't Feel Like..), yeah!!! Rockin! And, the strangest cut, my favorite, \\"Los\\", a straight 4-bar acoustic, blues song. And the guys nail it. Who'd've guessed Rammstein could do the blues??? But they do - with their own signature.   I think they could have done better in the time they had to work on it. This CD isn't as good as the last 3 (or 4)but, HEY! That's just my opinion.
B0000630YA|5.0|This is the first, and best, solo Alice set. It is a concept album and features all of the weird studio effects Bob Ezrin has become known for....listen to Kiss' Destroyer or Pink Floyd's The Wall for similar sounding sets. <br />Still, this one is all Alice. It features the same themes of mental illness and wreckless behaviour that Alice is known for. <br />\\"Devil's Food\\", \\"The Black Widow\\" and \\"Cold Ethyl\\" are a welcomed return to form for Alice after the humorless Muscle Of Love album. \\"Stephen\\" is almost disturbing and the final songs of the set continue the \\"collapse\\" until \\"Escape\\" serves as the wake up call. <br />A classic from beginning to end.
B00000I8UF|5.0|I bought an original release LP in 1959 when I was 17. I took it to my girl friend's house hot from the store. Her dad had a then state of the art mono HiFi with FM receiver. We all were just blown away by the absolute power of every track. I wore out the original mono LP and a stereo version. I have a CD example but I may have to have the re-mastered release. My favorite cut is Drum-Thunder Suite, a brilliant composition that shows off the range and energy of the Messengers. I was lucky enough to hear it done live by the version of Jazz Messengers with Wynton Marsalis and I still prefer the original. <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|Their goal is pretty clear -- make a simple, obvious album that will please fans of simple, obvious U2 music, and pile on as many pretty piano notes, sound washes and echoey \\"vintage U2\\" guitars as possible in an attempt to mask a truly pathetic absence of melodic ideas. U2 on their comfort zone  <br /> <br />For worse, Bono sounds completely ragged and thin. Vertigo is a spruced up rip-off of Sonic Youth's Dirty Boots. No new hooks to be found beneath the lush veneer. By the last three songs, they don't even bother trying to be pretty -- it's just \\"the same old s**t ballads\\" to fill out the rest of the running time. And U2 pandering to disgruntled rockcrits is no better than Britney pandering to hormonally challenged suburban white boys.  <br /> <br />Songs like Sometimes or All Because Of You are those kind of continually-recycled songs with sappy lyrics that radio programmers are more than inclined to play, what with this being the golden age of payola in the US. Listen to Original Of The Species...What a repulsive, horrific, ugly song. It's all very slow and atmospheric 'CLASSIC U2' but that's not enough to hide the fact that the melodies are either full of cliched audience-manipulation devices
B0007TKNL0|5.0|You know that a movie works when it follows you long after you've left the movie theater.  I saw the Broadway tour of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" a few years ago and it has been my favorite musical since. I love it more than Cats, 42nd Street, West Side Story, Les Miserables, Miss Saigon...you name it. Its romanticism and beautiful songs just blew me away. <br /> <br />I was then somewhat hesitant to see the film version, fearing that it would not live up to my expectations. A little over two hours later and I found myself crying over the Phantom (Gerard Butler) and his love for the young Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) as she decides between him or the nobleman Raoul (Patrick Wilson). <br /> <br />In short, I love this movie! It was everything I had hoped it to be and more. The story is faithful to the stage version but it also gives the audience a closer look into the lives of the three main characters. The art direction, sets and costumes are resplendent and breath-taking. And the songs are brought to life superbly by the talented cast of young newcomers (Rossum, Wilson) and film veterans (Miranda Richardson, Ciaran Hinds, Simon Callow).  <br /> <br />I know many would argue that Michael Crawford was a superb Phantom...that is, except for me.  I always felt that Crawford's voice was too high-pitched and not manly enough. To me, Gerard Butler is more effective Phantom. Apart from being incredibly handsome (under that make-up), tall and well built, he also has this rough and raspy voice that is very masculine and full of passion. He IS the Phantom! Emmy Rossum has a hauntingly beautiful voice and has an innocence and sweetness that fits perfectly for Christine.  Her voice gives me goosebumps! Patrick Wilson's romantic voice contrasts well with that of the Phantom's. After all, one is supposed to be a nobleman and the romantic hero while the other is dark, mysterious and brooding (like the misunderstood Quasimodo of \\"Hunchback of the Notre Dame.\\") But even without the singing, Gerard Butler turns in a memorable and passionate performance as the Phantom and you really do feel for him in the end. If there was one fault to this film, for me, it would be Minnie Driver's Carlotta. She was so over the top that I sometimes found her grating. <br /> <br />All in all, however, I walked out of the theater wanting to see \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" again and again (I've now seen it twice and counting). I couldn't get the music out of my head and have since purchased the CD.  I can't wait for the dvd to come out so I can watch it over and over. I highly recommend it to fans of the stage version, music lovers and incurable romantics everywhere.  And if you loved the songs, be sure to pick up the equally superb soundtrack. This phantom will haunt you long after you've left the movie theater....and I have gladly fallen under its spell. Superb! <br />
B00005JMYI|5.0|No kidding. I haven't laughed so much and had so much fun in decades.    The movie begins by proudly stating: \\"The following is based on actual events. Only the names, locations and events have been changed.\\"    From then on the laughs never stop. It is Junior High humor at its best.    The delightful Ms. Christina Applegate as Veronica Corningstone and Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy are the dynamic duo of commedy.    Pay attention to the background: there are a lot of funny things going on. My favorite was a big sign in front of a Mexican restaurant: \\"Escupimos en su comida.\\" You don't want to be a \\"gringo\\" in that part of town.    Baxter the dog shows extraordinary skill at stealing all his scenes and at the end walks away with the movie. He was not listed in the credits and that was a sad oversight. Baxter deserved an Academy nomination.    Steve Carell describes Brick Tamland his character as \\"an independent thinker because he thinks independently of his brain - intelligence is not one of his attributes.\\" Tamland himself says that his IQ is 48.    Brick Tamland ends his career as one of the top political advisers to the Bush White House. And that, folks, may be more than satire.    This DVD is worth its price down to the las penny. It will extend your life for laughter is the best medicine.
B00026WU7I|5.0|It has been thirty years since \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" was released and of all of the albums recorded by Bob Dylan it is the one that has most increased in stature simply because every album produced since then has failed to rise to this level. I think the reason for this is mainly because it was born in a creative burst of pointed lyricisim as his marriage to Sara Lowndes collapsed, with all the songs written in two months in the middle of 1974. I would no more expect any personal turmoil to provide similar inspiration any more than I would have expected any of the songs on this album to rise to the level of social rhetoric found in his greatest songs of the Sixties.<br /><br />In \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" Dylan also turned his back on his greatest backing band, returning to his artistic routes on an album that is largely acoustic-based. The songs run the emotional gamut from sorrow and regret to bitterness and pain. At the same time, despite the obvious point of origin for most of these songs, this is not an openly confessional album (cf. Courtney Love's \\"America's Sweetheart\\"). After all, we are talking the lyrics of Bob Dylan, which means cryptic riddles and allegories abound all laid out in ten classic tracks:<br /><br />\\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" is the best song on the album and the ambguity about the characters and relationships Dylan sings about has only increased over the years with the shifting lyrics in various performances. The cover version by the Indigo Girls remains my favorite Dylan cover.<br /><br />\\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" is another great four-word phrase in a song that represents the most overtly personal song on the album. The stark instrumentation only serves to highlight the heartbreak of the existentialist lyrics and the mournful sound of the vocals.<br /><br />\\"You're A Big Girl Now\\" is a ballad on the end of a relationship and a sort of benediction in that clearly the woman is right to move on, but Dylan is still haunted by their physical encounters. You would think that this would have been the logical final track for the album, but it is not.<br /><br />\\"Idiot Wind\\" is song on the album that most reminds me of an earlier Dylan composition, namely \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" the pair being a set of put-down songs. The difference is that while both song lash out in lots of directions, this one keeps coming back to a certain \\"babe.\\" This is another song that has changed over the year for various reasons that could well inspire a doctoral dissertation.<br /><br />\\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" is a rather upbeat track, despite the descending chord progressions, and is usually considered a song hopeful of reconciliation rather than one eulogizing the breakup.<br /><br />\\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" stands out musically as the most blues oriented track that always struck me as cleansing the palatte for what was coming next on the album.<br /><br />\\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" is a 8:50 story song that basically wears down the listener's insistence that this is a biographical album. It also has a line that Dylan seems to sing with nic epitch and without affection, to wit, \\"and Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.\\" Pay attention next time through to that one phrase.<br /><br />\\"If You See Her, Say Hello\\" probably represents the emotional low point of the album, with lyrics reflecting a singer who is crushed and embittered by the end of the relationship, turning his anger in on himself.<br /><br />\\"Shelter from the Storm\\" is a song of simple beauty, based on three chords and a simple melody, underscoring a profound sense of loss. The song provides an avalanche of symbols and metaphors, but actually seems to end on an optimstic note.<br /><br />\\"Buckets of Rain\\" provides a fitting finale, suitably depressing lyrics against a rather upbeat melody as irony once again abounds. After this song there is no where left to go.<br /><br />\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is listed by \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazineas the #16 record on the list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, between #15 \\"Are You Experienced?\\" by the Jimi Hendrix Experience and #17 \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana.

B0000035E7|5.0|This isn't music thats been handled, abused, edited by anyone just to make it sell.  The sound is heavy, troddingly raw with an unprocessed purity.  If you can't handle music that hasn't been primped and manicured and overproduced to the point of taking every ounce of vitality from the sound and meaning, then maybe you should go buy a Smashing Pumpkins album.  One could say that grunge is simply a manicured and primped version of Punk though.  Or you could realize that the purpose of punk IS to sound bad, a step that Nirvana doesnt take on this album.  The music speaks in a frenzied, angred, cynical tone, which is completely understandable coming from such a bleak, meaningless period in the musical timeline, similar to the modern state of music, only then it was hair metal and synth pop, and now its nu metal and ...well pretty much everything else.   This is definitely one of the most under-rated albums of all time.
B000002G7G|5.0|After the unfortunate departure of John Cale, the Velvet Underground had a musical revamp -- their third album, \\"The Velvet Underground\\" is smoother and less gritty. Stripped of the shock value, the best of the Velvet Underground shines through -- great musical skills and beautiful songwriting.<br /><br />That change is evident from the very start, \\"Candy Says,\\" which is sort of the musical musings of transsexual Candy Darling. Rather than playing this for shock value, the way the Velvets did earlier -- see songs like \\"Heroin\\" and \\"Venus in Furs\\" -- it's soft, sweet and a bit poignant, ending with \\"Maybe when I'm older/What do you think I'd see/If I could walk away from me.\\"<br /><br />That mellower tone sets the stage for the rest of the album, which relies on poetic lyrics and strong music -- they no longer sing about S&M and drugs, but about self-examination and redemtpion. The Velvets' rock sound is less jagged and more laid-back, and they even take a foray into twangy country music in \\"Some Kinda Love.\\"<br /><br />A few songs hint at the earlier work that the Velvets did, with tambourines and blurred, high vocals from Lou Reed. But can you imagine the Velvet Underground, in their first album, ever singing a non-satirical song about Jesus Christ, as they do in one haunting ballad on here? I certainly can't, and it seems to be a part of the pensive, self-examining mood that permeates this album.<br /><br />The one exception is \\"The Murder Mystery.\\" It's literally impossible to understand the \\"right voice\\" and \\"left voice\\" speaking in this song. It's interesting, but completely unintelligible. However, this is amply made up for in the mature instrumentation and lyrics; while Doug Yule was not as great as John Cale, he does a good job with the organ. The fuzzy edge of Velvet Underground rock is retained, while they branched out into ethereal ballads and pretty acoustic songs.<br /><br />Reed's lyrics betray a greater maturity, and maybe greater poignancy. \\"One minute born, one minute doomed,/One minute up, one minute down/What goes on in your mind?\\" he ponders at the start of the album. He sings some of the songs, sounding surprisingly melodic, since his voice was kind of creaky; on the other hand, Moe Tucker provides some fair vocals for songs like \\"After Hours.\\"<br /><br />The Velvet Underground hit another peak in their self-titled album.

They just walk around cussing and complaining about how terrible life is and how everybody is so stupid. Buscemi was good (a little strange) but the guy with the numchucks was the best. Unfortunately, you only see \\"numchucks\\" for a total of 90 seconds. I think the funniest scene was when Buscemi goes into the convenient store steaming mad and tries to knock over the food shelf.

B0001906O0|3.0|And that is simply what this box is...too much.  I am thrilled that all of this Cure stuff is being remastered and re-released, but the way they are going about it assumes alot of the consumer I think.  I am an early Cure fan, basically anything up to and including Japanese Whispers.  So I purchased a $40/$50 4 cd box set spanning from 1978 to 2001, and will only listen to the first 15 tracks on the first disc.  I think these b-sides could have been included on the deluxe editions of the albums coming out.  If you look at them, the first discs only have the main albums, and all the extra tracks are on the 2nd discs, which is alot of demos and live stuff.  If they are going to release live stuff, release entire concerts from eras, and place the b-sides and rarities with the album they belong with.  I'm just tired of buying multiple things to get the songs I want, because record companies don't make the best use of the cd medium, and try to make the most money out of all of this.  Another prime example is the Slowdive \\"Catch The Breeze\\" compilation recently released by Sanctuary.  I am glad that they are remastered it, and the packaging is nice; but disc 1 clocks in at 63:32, the 2nd at 55:07.  41, almost 42 wasted minutes of space that could have been filled with many of the songs from EPs and other rarities that were left off.  Where does it end?  Rhino or whoever, should at least consider splitting this box up into the individual discs to purchase seperately.  Am I really asking too much?  Am I making too much of this?  I don't think so.  I am not a wealthy person, by any means.  To pay $40 for one cd, is a bit much for me.  Don't assume I like everything a band releases!  We don't all just go out and buy the next album by an artist because it has their name on it.  (Though most do I guess!) Some of us, are a little more discerning, and want to be able to purchase what we feel are only essential to us! So after all this, you may wander how I even managed to give this the rating I did.  First of all, the packaging is quite nice and informative.  I now realize why my favorite Cure music is my favorite (Chris Parry's production combined with the early tensions of the band).  Secondly, the remastering is very well done, and is really accentuated on a good stereo system.  Thirdly, even after my problem with having to buy the whole box, I still have all these early b-sides and rarities compiled on one disc, some of which are hard to find.  If you are an all across the board fan of all Cure music, you will definitely want to buy this.  If you are an early fan like myself, you may hold off, or just get Japanese Whispers for some of the quirky essential b-sides from that era, at a lower price.his the rating I did.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Writer/director Darren Aronofsky's (with co-writer Hubert Selby, Jr., based on his novel) harrowing film is a study of addiction in all its forms-not just addiction to drugs, but also to television, dreams, fame, sugar, and sex.  Harry (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) are a couple buddies who hustle drugs and get high together; they even manage to set money aside and feel like they are making successes of themselves in their own way.  They discover how precarious their position really is when the supply of drugs in their area dries up and they are forced to go on the road to find more.  Marion (Jennifer Connolly) is Harry's beautiful girlfriend, who squanders money from her wealthy family while she feeds her addiction and dreams of opening a boutique with Harry's help.  Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is Harry's nave mother, whose belief that she will appear on an infomercial leads her into an addiction to diet pills in an effort to lose weight.     Each of these characters is sustained by a dream that enables them to use drugs, believing that it is a temporary stage on their way to a brighter future.  By the end of the film, all of their dreams have been cruelly but unavoidably crushed and the characters themselves have spiraled into their separate lonely hells.  It's not easy to watch because the talented cast invests their characters with much compassion.      Don't see this film if you are one of those people who believes that all movies should make us feel good.  But do see it if you believe films should make us feel deeply./

Super<br /><br />On the back of the CD, what would have been side two of the original record release, is above what would have been side one. So if you do not happen to notice that they are labeled as side one and side two then you may be confused.  However a CD as we all know only has one side.<br /><br />Anyway, the album is brilliant.  I'll bet Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother said some variation of \\"we're gonna do it anyway\\" a time or two in their careers as NEU!  Just look at the record, the track listing is shoved all the way into the top left corner and takes a minute to figure out.  Beyond that, once you listen to the album you'll notice something.  For those familiar with turntable speeds, you'll know that Super 16 does not refer to the variation of 16mm motion picture film used to give a higher quality look when transfered to 35mm.  If you know anything about the history of the turntable, records, and vinyl (in relation to sound recording) you'll know about the 16RPM records were used for voice recording and by Chrysler for the car stereo turntables that they jokingly used.  They printed special versions of various albums in 16RPM.  Yes, to answer your question, every bump your car hit caused the needle to scratch and most likely ruin you're album.  The turntable was only good when the player was used while your car was at a complete stop.  Anyway, they took the same song (on vinyl) that was recorded at 33 1/3 speed and ran it at 16 and 78 RPMs. They even included the 33 1/3RPM version.  They even have another track (Neuschnee) at 33 1/3 were they run it at 78 and include both versions.  I'm sure someone along the way said something to Dinger and Rother and they replied with some variation of \\"we're gonna do it anyway.\\"  Different versions of the same song?  Hard to read track listing?  They deserve some credit for doing what they want to do. It obviously looks like somewhere along the way they didn't take someone's advice and it was for the better!<br /><br />The music holds up even under the technical aspects.  Weak music is made even more weak with technical special effects.  However, great music can be made even better with the same effects.<br /><br />I'm only sad that each generation is farther removed from vinyl than the last.  One day someone will see this album and say \\"what does 16 and 78 mean?\\"ey took the same song (on vinyl) that was recorded at 33 1/3 speed and ran it at 16 and 78 RPMs. They even included the 33 1/3RPM version.

B000000OU6|4.0|When 5 o'clock was released I think a lot of people raced out to get a copy expecting to hear a new Guns album only to be disappointed. I reckon this is a great album from Slash, although it is long, and at times slow, and I can see why the November Rain loving, top 40 crowd wouldn't like it. Eric Dover's husky vocals are cool in my book, I was disappointed when he didn't sing on the Ain't Life Grand album. Best songs: Dime Store Rock, Good to be Alive and Soma City Ward.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Most of the brilliant punk or post-punk records sound like they were put together in a week in the studio - that's part of their charm.  This one breaks that rule.  The album I can most compare it to is London Calling (gasp!).  Both give you lots of music that is all top-notch and featuring a lot of different styles and influences, without sounding \\"derivative\\".  It's so well done, diverse and compelling, and you don't have to skip over anything.
B000002INJ|2.0|After having owned a copy of Fighting the World for over 10 years and thinking it was pretty good, I thought it was about time I bought another Manowar album to check out. After reading reviews of albums on Amazon I decided to grab a copy of Kings of Metal, bad move. 3 or 4 tracks feature choirs, which would be okay for intro's maybe, but they drag on for 4 or 5 minutes, one track is some old guy telling a boring medieval story featuring horses and swords, and that Sting of the Bumblebee bass guitar crap is just painful. The rest of the album is okay, although very over produced, but not good enough to keep me interested, I took it back and got a refund. Kings of metal with highly over produced choirs etc? hardly
0385510454|3.0|Until about fifteen years ago, I used to be stuck on Science Fiction and Fantasy books, until that is, I read John Grisham's, then latest novel, The Firm. Like the present day Da Vinci Code phenomenon, Grisham splashed into the scene with The Firm, which was somewhat of a phenomenon in 1990-91, except The Firm was twice as good. In fact The Firm was twice as good as anything out there at the time, including Grisham's other popular books like The Pelican Brief and A Time To Kill and those books are twice as good as The Broker.<br /><br />What happened to John Grisham? The Broker is not a bad book. At least not for an average writer but Grisham is not an average writer or at least he didn't used to be. He has written some of the most memorable books around. Let's see, they have made something like seven of his books into movies and they're probably working on another as I write this.<br /><br />It seems that Mr Grisham has started off on such a high note that he can't even come close to his earlier successes. Five of his last six books have been also rans. (The Last Juror was pretty good in my estimation) Evidently Grisham is having a problem coming up with storylines and developing descent plots, and that is the biggest problem with The Broker - a weak plot.<br /><br />The Broker<br /><br />Joel Backman, a self promoting power hungry Washington power broker/lobbyist had gone too far and ended up in federal prison for twenty years. All of a sudden he's granted an eleventh hour Presidential pardon and whisked off to Italy, Where he's never been and he doesn't even speak the language. What Happened?<br /><br />This whole mess started when three young Pakistani hackers discovered some unknown orbiting, state of the art, satellites and managed to compromise, disable and gain control of them. They then proceeded to hire Backman to find a buyer for the controlling devices. This proves to be disastrous as Backman is indicted for treason and his confederate, Jacy Hubbard is murdered, enticing Backman to plead guilty to a lesser charge for self preservation.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />Teddy Maynard the wheelchair bound Director of Intelligence sees an opportunity to clean up the Backman mess. Vanilla President Morgen is about to leave office after his crushing repudiation. Maynard thinks Morgen is a dunce but he wants this one last favor, to grant a pardon to Backman and to this end he gets Morgen's chief of Staff, Critz to intercede in favor.<br /><br />Backman has been a thorn in Maynard's side for six years and had been stony silent about the events leading to his incarceration and he was not likely to get any information from him in the future. He had been Director for eighteen years and felt the incoming President would probably eventually replace him, so he figured this might be his last best chance to tie up the Backman loose end and get one last tidbit of information. Who would be the ones who would kill Backman? Would it be the Israelis, The Saudis, The Russians or the Chinese?<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Apparently Grisham is trying to change his luck by changing what he writes about. Being a Mississippi attorney, he honed his writing skills writing about Lawyers and Law, a profession he seems to disdain based on the stories he's written. After this foray into action -thrillers, he should probably stay within the legal field.<br /><br />Grisham's writing style, which is fluid, descriptive and easy going is still evident in this book which I would describe as a thrillerless thriller but the protagonist, who's life was supposed to be in danger, never even seems close to getting killed and the whole premise for the story seems very weak, especially from such an esteemed author.<br /><br />The setting, primarily in Bologna Italy seems strange as well. The head spook ostensibly wants to set Backman up for a hit yet he sets him up in Italy with a couple handlers and gives him a crash course in Italian. Why bother! Why not just dump him somewhere, leak his whereabouts and watch the fireworks. Of course we have the bunch that gave us phantom WMD in Iraq and failed to prevent the 9/11 catastrophe, trying to set up our man for a hit. Naturally the Keystone Spooks botch that as well.<br /><br />Anyway Grisham makes up for the weak plot by some nice writing. We don't know what to think of Backman who seems to change before our eyes. He seems to grow as a person, becomes enchanted with the simple life Italy has to offer and finds a love interest in one of his two language tutors who is also a tour guide. Grisham goes into great detail in his substantial descriptions of Treviso, Bologna and Milan, all located in a country he says he is fascinated with and most likely the reason for the setting.<br /><br />Recommended only for die hard Grisham readers and those interested in Italy.e in Italian.

B0006SSOHM|2.0|There were some things that didn't make sense in this movie. For starters, the Asian cop who was killed in that house of horrors. You would think there would be a major criminal investigation in that place. But no. Nothing. And why did they go alone instead of calling for backup? That didn't make sense. Another thing, we're to believe these people are being put through all this because of something bad they've done in their lives but the two main characters in the film who are chained up have done nothing wrong. The doctor was going to have an affair but he didn't. The other guy who works at the hospital...well there weren't any questions answered about him. I can't bring up the biggest problem in the movie without giving the ending away. All in all, the movie was all right. I liked the set up but it lacked suspense and the plot just didn't make sense.
0385510454|1.0|I am a fan of Grisham and when I read what the book was about I thought it sounded interesting enough to purchase in hardback version. If you are interested in learning the language of Italian or the history of Italy, this is the book for you. Phrases and words are translated throughout the book making me think he was already loking ahead towards a movie and did all the translating for them. Seriously I would highly suggest you skip this book or goto a library and check it out. Do not waste your hard earned money.
1564029654|2.0|My mom has her BA in child psychology and she thinks this is a great book, my sister with two sons loves it but I as the aunt with no children dislike it.<br /><br />This book tells the story of three baby bird who wake up to discover they are alone. The best part of this book is that there discussion about where mom has gone keeps them from getting into mischief. The worst part is that it gives the impression that mom will sneak out during the night without so much as a goodbye-I don't personally know a good mother that will do that as it just increases the anxiety experienced by a child.<br /><br />Gave it 2 rating because somehow my nephews love it. I personally prefer other books like the editor said that create a better scenario to help children cope with separation anxiety.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna is a very talented singer whose major talent is changing her style for every album. While her new \\"Kaballah phase\\" is a bit...hmmm...strange for her standards, it's hard to forget her best album \\"Ray of Light\\" (\\"Music\\" was horrible...too freestyle). Personally, I really love the dance beats on this album. Time for the song-by-song breakdown: <br />1. Drowned World/Substitute For Love (A-) - Single in the UK. Awesome, absolutely awesome. It could use a beat makeover (lol), but it's great. Hard not to like it. Classic. <br />2. Swim (B+) Fun. Not as good as \\"Drowned World\\", but another awesome song. <br />3. Ray of Light (A) One of Madonna's best singles. Fun dance hit. The extended mix is on the album, not the shorter version everyone heard on the radio in 1999. Awesome, really well done. One of the best songs on the album. <br />4. Candy Perfume Girl (C) Worst song on the album. Just doesn't agree with me. <br />5. Skin (A-) DANCE! YES! I really like dance songs, and this is just what dance fans need to have their day made. Kind of cheesy, but most vocal dance songs are. Awesome song. <br />6. Nothing Really Matters (A-) It's strange how so many people dislike this song. The vocals are great (like on the whole album), and the beat is great. It's not as self-centered as many people think. Good fun to listen to. <br />7. Sky Fits Heaven (A+) Total classic. While it is not a single (how sad), it's the best song on the album. Great lyrics, great vocals. The chorus is absolutely awesome. One of my favorite songs ever, actually. The \\"Traveling down my own road\\" part makes the song A+ material. Just awesome. Nothing else to say. Just awesome. <br />8. Shanti/Ashtangi (A-) While I have no idea what this song's language is, it's a great listen. Different from most of the songs on the album, but, in this case, different is good. Great song, and you will get used to the different language. <br />9. Frozen (B+) Moving lyrics, but very long. Hey, wait a minute, all of the songs on this album are long! Nevermind. Anyway, this song is more downtempo and sends the album off in a different direction. No more high-powered dance songs :-( but still good songs. Great chorus. Moving, touching, and catchy. <br />10. Power of Goodbye (A-) Great song with great lyrics, vocals, beat, and music. Yeah, Madonna! Kind of like \\"Frozen\\" only faster and shorter. <br />11. To Have And Not To Hold (A) Awesome. Kind of like \\"Power of Goodbye\\", but mellower. Great song. Kind of islandish and is great to listen to in warm weather (from experience - random but whatever). Great song. <br />12. Little Star (B) Ode to the daughter. Dancier, but not such a big hit for me.  <br />13. Mer Girl (B+) Very, very different. Basically no beat. Really creepy, but its subtle-but-there storyline will make listeners hanging on. A mellow way to end an awesome album. <br /> <br />Overall, the album gets an A-. Classics, fun songs, hard to beat. Buy this album if you like female vocals with moving beats. If you don't like Madonna, this album is different from anything else she's done, so give it a try. Enjoy, go buy it NOW!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|The nature of human motivation has usually two different sources that elicit a certain behavior.  These sources are either extrinsic or intrinsic.  Intrinsic motivation stems from within a person while the extrinsic source is influence generated by someone or something else.  Whether the source is external or internal it also presents a further division in needs and desires.  Needs being what a person requires to survive, and desires illustrates what a person wants.  Saw presents situations where human motivation is put to the test in regards to survival and the desire to live.  However, the situation that Saw presents comes at a dreadful price, which will undoubtedly terrorize the audience's own consciousness and perception of human needs and desires.<br /><br />The opening of Saw introduces two characters chained to heavy pipes in an abandoned bathroom at some unknown location where no one can hear them scream.  The room has intense lighting once the lights are turned on, which tosses no shadows of either character. In essence, it is a visual analogy for how their persona will be scrutinized by both parties, as the light will reveal everything.  Quickly one of the men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), questions why they are there because if someone desired them dead it could have been accomplished long ago.<br /><br />When the light is turned on for the first time, Adam (Leigh Whannell), discovered that he is not alone in the room, as between him and Dr. Gordon there is a corpse with a gun in it's hand and a tape recorder in the other.  It seems as if the corpse has blown away part of his own cranium with the gun in his hand.  Under the intense light the two chained men begin to search for ways of escaping, while they begin to discover small clues of what is expected out of them.<br /><br />It seems as if Adam is expected to kill himself, which he finds out through a tape that he finds in his own pocket.  Dr. Gordon discovers a similar tape and a bullet in his pocket that expresses anticipation in regards to Dr. Gordon who is expected to murder his new roommate.  The two men have a little more than six hours to find a solution to their deadly predicament.  During these six hours the audience is drawn into a number of flashbacks that provide information of how they were chosen to participate in this sick game.  It is also revealed that Dr. Gordon is aware of who the person is that has chained them in the unfamiliar room.<br /><br />Through Dr. Gordon it is disclosed that a serial killer that goes by the nickname Jigsaw has taken them hostage and chained them.  The killer himself has never actually killed someone, however, he has planned some truly grotesque schemes that have led to a tormenting death that has delivered pain of inconceivable magnitude.  The great extent to which the Jigsaw killer has planned his bizarre schemes will display a man with enormous amount motivation to seek some form of enlightenment in an outmost horrific manner.<br /><br />Saw dwells in the twilight land as it offers the audience a haunting journey that plunges deep into the darkness of the human psyche where nothing is sacred, as human motivation to live is skewed by an external source.  A mind to generate such horrors illustrates deep insights into psychology and human behavior, but it also displays the eccentricity of a creative mind.  James Wan and Leigh Whannell who created the story together offer a horror tale that evokes nightmares and difficult sleeping patterns in retrospect of the cinematic experience.<br /><br />The film had a good beginning theme, however, after about an hour and ten minutes the film seemed to begin slowly spiral downwards.  Nonetheless, Saw offers a truly ghastly film experience, which is built on good script and good mise-en-scene that helps enhance the terror in the story.  The camera work elevates the film, as it brings moments to the audience that will awaken feelings of revulsion and dismay.  In the end, do not expect a good night sleep, as Saw will haunt the mind for sometime after the end credits have been burnt into the retina of the audience.he mind for sometime after the end credits have been burnt into the retina of the audience.

B00008EY7H|3.0|Not as good as others such as Varekai, Quidam, Drallion and Saltimbanco.   <br /> <br />Seems as though it has a subtle darkness or negative feel in both the music and the show which slightly overshadows the performances.  The other Cirque shows have music that for the most part seems uplifting and joyous, but in my opinion Allegria has only one or two songs that contain joyous melodic tones. <br /> <br />This is Kind of ironic considering the title Allegria which means \\"Joy\\".   <br /> <br />
B00008976Y|5.0|Juliette Binoche gives a startling performance here as a young woman whose husband and young daughter are both killed in a car crash that puts her in the hospital with not much more than some bruising.  What's so powerful about this film is not what is said--or what is not said, but conveyed by the tremendous collaboration of actor and director--through gesture, through facial expression, through visual technique, through sound.  One of Kieslowski's last films, this is light years away from earlier work like, for example, Blind Chance, and fearlessly probes the inner life of a grief-stricken woman.<br /><br />As Binoche herself points out in an interview--one of the many great special features on this disk--the scene in which she crunches a lollipop (the sound is magnified with a contact mike to convey the smashing of the hard candy with her teeth) is far more effective than would be her screaming or sobbing.  Kieslowski uses an interesting mix of visual and aural techniques to express the woman's guilt, grief, and, more than anything else, loss of desire to connect to others.<br /><br />Earlier in the film, soon after the accident, she does forge a physical connection with her deceased husband's colleague, but it is a one-night stand that she needs to give back to her a sense of her body, nothing more.  She quickly dismisses him the next day.<br /><br />The theme of this film, it seems to me, is not whether a person can be altruistic or not, as stated by film critic Annette Insdorf in another special feature, but whether a person can actually make a connection to another person.  Binoche's Julie (her character's name) rids herself of everything connected to her marriage after the accident, but because people, in oen way or another, impose themselves on her, she has no choice but to, ultimately reforge connections with those around her.<br /><br />The title is reflected in the blue that permeates the film--in the water in which she swims, in a blue glass chandelier, in the lighting of many frames for which the cinematographer, also interviewed, indicates he used a subtle blue gel filter.  Blue also conveys pornography, and even that is here, in the form of a neighbor of Julie's who works in the sex industry.  And, of course, it refers to sadness.<br /><br />But as well, blue is the color of the French flag correlated with liberty.  Here, Kieslowski tells the tale of a woman liberated from her former life by tragic circumstances.  It is this liberation, he says, (the implication is that it may be through tragic or non-tragic circumstances) that allows us to forge connections with others, connections that we might not otherwise make without being liberated.<br /><br />A beautifully shot film, Blue is a unique marvel of cinema that should without question establish Kieslowski as one of the master filmmakers of the 20th century.  It is truly unfortunate that he is no longer with us.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.handelier, in the lighting of many frames for which the cinematographer, also interviewed, indicates he used a subtle blue gel filter.

B00001NFCY|4.0|Creed's Human Clay probably was the most sold album for the band with thousands buying this CD. I have the Australian release of the album which has a bonus track to it, the acoustic version of Young Grow Old. In this album, Scott Stapp lead vocalist came of age and showed us all the pure talent of his voice. Be mindful that this album was released when Creed was one solid unit before internal band rivalry began.<br /><br />Many have tried labelling Creed as a young Christian band however they have stated they are not a Christian band. Their lyrics may involve certain spiritual topics but they have not tried to mass convert us through music. The songs 'What If' and 'Wrong Way' deals with missed chances and the decisions and where they lead us in our own lives. But the greatest song with the outstanding vocals and lyrics by Stapp has to be 'With Arms Wide Open' - I remember going to a friend's wedding and this song was sung as the groom and bride danced their first dance. The song is followed by 'Higher' another timeless tune. I very much enjoyed this album and if I could rate it more I would.
B000060MWU|5.0|I usually don't blast other reviewers, because everyone is entitled to an opinion, but c'mon...    I can't believe the reviews I've read about this film.  I read about people calling this film garbage, largely because they don't understand it.  You know what?  Go out and rent American Pie 6 or Rocky 22 if you're into a movie that requires no thought or study!  The facts are as follows:  Movies relying solely on reality are about as shallow as pop rock, hotel room paintings and Chuck E. Cheese.  For a movie to truly be a \\"suspense,\\" it needs to be be intriguing, and YES, hard to follow.  I hate to sound intolerant, but if you hate this movie, you're stupid.  Plain and simple.    David Lynch, in his later films, delves into dream worlds.  Both LOST HIGHWAY and MULHOLLAND DR. prove this fact.  The reason people get lost is that they can't decipher what is a dream and what is real.  Guess what?  In our own derranged minds, many of us find the same problem in our twisted lives.  Did I dream that, or did it really happen?  If you watch this movie twice, you will see the obvious clues which tell you when the narrator is dreaming and when he is not.  ALL of Lynch's films have a main character, a protagonist, and an antagonist...just like driectors and screen writers have been doing since the early 1900's.  People have been making psychological thrillers since the 1930's and they are just as hard to follow as some of the current films.  What people don't understand is this:  if you're making a psychological thriller, you need to be original and raise the bar.  Lynch CLEARLY does that here and with Mulholland Dr.      The story centers around Pullman's character.  He is suspicious of his wife, who he believes is cheating on him.  He freaks out, gets involved in a murder, and in a dream state, he imagines himself as Getty's character--a fictitious, make believe world.  The real treat of this film, the GEM if you will, is Robert Blake's imaginary character.  The scennes involving him and the video tape sequences are the creepiest thing I have ever seen in my life...and I love horror films.  Trust me--you will be creeped out forever.  The images are burned into your brain.      \\"You've been in my house?\\"  \\"I'm there right now...go ahead...call me!\\"
B00070Q7VO|1.0|Well, it's obvious the Warner Brothers promo department is doing their darndest to plug this CD with all of these \\"amazing reviews,\\" but for us in the know, this record \\"It's Time\\" means only one thing...time to shut off this CD. What an arrogant title. Brings back memories of Harry Connick Jr.'s first vocal remarks on that \\"Star Turtle\\" CD where he begins the CD actually saying...\\"It's Time.\\" And we saw where that went. <br /> <br />This CD is nothing more than covers of songs that have done a hundred different time by a hundred different artists before him, and they continue to play it safe with material familiar to us all. If this guy put out an original album, I doubt you'd even hear of it. <br /> <br />And by the way, the photo's look great, but I've yet to see one TV appearance by this guy where he looks like any of them.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I was watching Fuse one night and heard/saw the \\"Reptilia\\" video.  I had never heard anything like this band.  It was refreshing in the midst of all the typical Top 40 videos that surrounded it.  I decided to search for the CD.  I bought Room on Fire first and loved it so much that I sought out their first CD.  I was blown away even more by it.  I'm addicted to listening to this band.  I'm never bored with their songs even though I listen to both of their CDs quite often.  They keep me pepped for long drives and exercise.  It has been quite some time since I've found CDs I could pop in and listen to without having to skip ahead of tracks.  If you're in the mood for something different and catchy you've found it.
0767802659|5.0|\\"Starship Troopers\\" is one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen. It's on my personal top-5 list, and I have seen it 30+ times since it was released in 1997. <br /> <br />Paul Verhoeven is one of the best directors in the world, possibly my favorite (along with Hughes). He is able to infuse the film with just the right mix of high-octane special effects, great battles, awesome space panoramas, and love scenes. <br /> <br />As a science-fiction buff, I am entralled by the futuristic spacecraft (which look much more realistic than Star Trek vehicles) and the hideous alien menace of the Arachnids. As an action fan, the battles more than sate my desire for some shoot-em-up fun. As a moviegoer, I enjoy Verhoeven's exploration of Heinlein's militaristic society ideas. Is it so far-fetched to believe that in the future a course will be taught on \\"how Democracy failed\\"? Look at the terrorist threat today (which some like to ignore).  <br /> <br />Speaking of Heinlein, I have not read his book. Many of those who do not like \\"Starship Troopers\\" tend to compare it negatively to the novel. I respect their love of the novel, but I am a fan of Verhoeven's movie, not Heinlein's book. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this, be prepared for some gore. Be prepared for main characers dying left and right. Be prepared for the Brain Bug.  <br /> <br />Buy the DVD. Lots of good features, and a first-rate movie that has been underrated for years.
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile On Main Street was the last of the Stones' 'great' albums. I think everybody knows the circumstances this album was recorded in, so I'll go straight to my review.  <br /> <br />Although there are some standouts on this album, there aren't any real Stones classics on this album. However, don't let this bring you down. The album as a whole is highly enjoyable, all the songs are pretty feel-good and make a nice listening atmosphere. There aren't any songs that ruin the album, all are listenable at least. If you took out one song from the album, it just wouldn't be the same. Before long you'll love all of the songs, as I do.  <br /> <br />The album begins with Rocks Off, arguably the best song on the album. Every time I listen to this, a smile shows up on my face. The horns shine on this one, and the guitar parts are great too. This will get you in tune for the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />Next comes Rip This Joint, a crazy rocker, Shake Your Hips, a dark but groovy tune, and Casino Boogie, a fun song. These songs may sound rushed at first, but they're an essential part of the album. Tumbling Dice is featured on Forty Licks, so you probably know it already. It's a fine rocker with some nice guitar by Mick Jagger, yes, Mick Jagger.  <br /> <br />Sweet Virginia opens my favourite part of the album, that goes up to Happy, with the most feel-good songs. I haven't met anybody who doesn't like Sweet Virginia. It's such a good tune, excellent to sing along. Everything's great on this one. Torn And Frayed has got arguably the funniest Keith vocals ever, but they sound extremely cool at the same time. Keith makes this song much better than would it be without the backing vocals, and it is already a damn good song without them.  <br /> <br />Sweet Black Angel is an acoustic song with political lyrics, pretty good, some great Mick and Keith harmonies. Loving Cup catches up on Torn And Frayed's happy rhythms, great song. I love the piano at the start. Happy has got some great, great lyrics (I never kept a dollar past sunset, always burnt a hole in my pants), plus an excellent Keith vocal, as someone else said, Mick has got THE voice, but Keith's singing can get to be as fun. A nice slide guitar, too, and I must reapeat, the lyrics are great, and I know a lot of people, incluiding myself, can relate to them.  <br /> <br />Turd On The Run lacks that something the last five songs have, but it's not bad. Ventilator Blues is excellent. It's the heaviest song in the album, and it has got a great riff. The ending is great, too. It goes straight into I Just Want To See His Face, good song. Poorly recorded, but anyway, all of the album is, and that's one of the reasons it's so great.  <br /> <br />Let It Loose is the ballad on the album. Starts off with a quiet guitar part, and ends up in an 'organized chaos' sort of way, which is great. This is a real good song. Then comes All Down The Line, one of my favourite songs since the first time I listened to the album, and that was back in February 2004. Not much to say about this song except that it is freaking great.  <br /> <br />Stop Breaking Down is a Robert Johnson cover, don't get fooled by the 'Traditional' credit it gets on the album's back cover. Cool slide guitar, but gets a bit too repetitive and long. Shine A Light has got a damn great solo, that is played not once but twice by Mick Taylor, perhaps his best work. Soul Survivor could have been better, but it's good anyway.  <br /> <br />As a conclusion, this album is incredible, one of the best ever. When you listen to Exile On Main Street, you go down on a journey, traveling through the different sections of the album. If you took out one song, it just wouldn't be the same. Don't be overwhelmed if the first listens are a blur, and the first songs are hard to listen to, you'll get used to it in little time.  <br /> <br />If you are deciding about buying the album, I say, get it. It's a real gem. You may say \\"Oh damn, what the hell is this\\" on the first few listens, but don't be worried; this album recieved the worst critisicm for it's first few years of existance, but it's now being regarded as one of the best albums on the whole world. And it is.
B00008438V|4.0|\\"Weird Science\\" is another John Hughes 80s flick, made after his masterpiece, \\"Sixteen Candles\\", and the excellent \\"Breakfast Club\\". No Molly Ringwald this time, but Anthony Michael Hall is in fine form, playing one of a duo of socially-inept (but computer genius) nerds who decide to create their own woman. <br /> <br />The movie is quite odd, with several surreal scenes that will have you shaking your head (but in a good way). Who could imagine, while the opening credits roll, that very soon AMH will be imitating an elderly black man in a bar, talking about women who have broken his heart? Who could imagine that an MX missile will play a role in the movie's denoument? Who could imagine that a slurpee could be a deadly projectile? <br /> <br />Kelly LeBrock is smoking hot as Lisa, the girl created from a Barbie doll and some microchips. Robert Downey, Jr. and Bill Paxton also appear, but it's the John Hughes directing touch that really propels this film. <br /> <br />Buy the DVD - despite having no extras, this is a film you won't get tired of. It bears repeated watchings very well.
B00000ILDE|5.0|`Aliens', directed by James Cameron is one of those rare sequels like `Godfather 2' and `From Russia With Love' which is better than its parent film. Cameron, who both directed and wrote the script achieves this distinction as much by simply making it an entirely different kind of movie which just happens to have the same hero and heavy as the original.<br /><br />`Alien' directed by Ridley Scott was a horror movie which could as easily be told on a lonely island with a run-down mansion and a mysteriously washed ashore egg as on an interstellar freighter which lands on an uncharted planet to investigate a mysterious signal. `Aliens' could as easily be told in the jungles of Vietnam or as a rescue mission to the missing colony of early Virginia settlers. In fact, `Apocalypse Now' and `Aliens' may be seen to have a remarkably parallel plot.<br /><br />This DVD has several new scenes which were cut from the original theatrical release and, like virtually every case I have seen before, these scenes add virtually nothing to the interest of the movie and it is obvious that it was a good idea it cut them in the first place. The only interesting fact I noticed was that we learn Ripley's first name in one of the restored scenes. None of the restored scenes, for example, eliminate the need to have seen the first episode in the series to fully understand this second story. They also in no way help to understand the Alien creatures' objectives and intelligence. Unlike the alien character in `Predator' who is simply on a little hunting excursion on a backwater planet with fairly well equipped and skilled game to track, kill, and return to home with his trophies.<br /><br />The heart of the problem is that while H.R. Geiger's exquisitely designed aliens are obviously intelligent, why are they so totally hostile to another intelligent race which is entirely capable of blowing their slime dripping, acid blooded heads clear off. It's obvious that in a fair fight, a heavily armed human has the advantage over the aliens, who seem to fight with nothing more than the weapons with which they were born, their claws, jaws, and tail. The deck is weighed heavily against the human marines in that they are fighting in confined spaces and the military command has taken no measures to adapt their tactics to the special abilities of their enemies. This is doubly puzzling in that the staff of the terraforming colony on the remote planet on which the aliens were found was clearly doing research on alien physiology. The two-week delay in telecommunications simply does not explain this lapse in the believability of the story.<br /><br />And yet, the story is so told so well that these implausabilities do not interfere with our enjoyment of the movie until the third or fourth viewing. This, of course, is one sign of a great movie to own, in that it yields new pleasures after the first viewing, even if those pleasures involve picking holes in the fabric of the world woven by Herr Cameron and his colleagues.<br /><br />Getting back to the alien behavior, I find it is much easier to believe the aliens' total hostility to humans in the light of recent fanatic Arab terrorism. Here we have humans whose world of beliefs and values is so different from those of a typical American that they can kill Christian Americans and their allies not only with no remorse, regret, or feeling of sin. They are so far removed from the way most people adjudicate conflicts that we find it easier to understand the Japanese kamikaze pilots who are defending a national homeland and attacking armed military combatants.<br /><br />The aliens' total otherness can then be added to the fact that humans can literally be domestic animals to them. Humans can serve as a cr&egrave;che for the parasitic alien embryos. But then, why don't the aliens simply work at domesticating humans as we domesticated pigs for our bacon and sausage? An even more interesting question is what is the nature of the species in which the aliens deposited their embryos before they ran into the human race, and why were there none of these critters on the derelict spaceship. One answer to this is that in spite of the fact that the aliens were smart enough to build a space ship, they still were not too bright. Or, maybe the alien race we encounter on this raw, isolated planet is a lesser form of being, in much the same way as the bugs in `Starship Troopers' had several different species, including a very fast hand to hand fighting infantryman backed by a `brain' creature which coordinated the various other species. But then, all this exposition would dissipate the sheer horror of anticipating the next encounter with the aliens.<br /><br />And, it's possible that `Aliens' sets some kind of record in the swing of the situation between peril and expectation of relief. By my count, there are at least six swings of the pendulum from peril to safety starting at the point Ripley looses contact with Newt in the last half hour of the flick. Others have noted, and I agree that the intensity of this part of the movie is made even more gripping in that the situation puts a little girl in mortal danger. I pass no judgment on whether this was going too far. I will say that it makes this and many other parts of the movie very difficult to watch. I interpret this as an extremely successful application of the moviemaker's art.<br /><br />I also was reminded that Cameron manages to slip in a clever little connection between the cyborgs in the `Alien' movies and events in the `Terminator' movies. Speaking of `Terminator', I really felt James Horner's music for `Aliens' did very little to enhance the experience, in comparison to Brad Fidel's score for `Terminator'.<br /><br />This movie has staying power, so buy the DVD!species in which the aliens deposited their embryos before they ran into the human race, and why were there none of these critters on the derelict spaceship.

6305508550|5.0|It's simple, really: \\"Office Space\\" is one of the best comedies ever made. Perhaps one smidgen below \\"Ghostbusters\\" or \\"Caddyshack\\", but right up there nonetheless. <br /> <br />Ron Livingstone is perfect, Jennifer Anison makes up for the travesty that was \\"Friends\\", and Stephen Root provides more laughs than you can shake a TPS report at. <br /> <br />One of the most-quotable movies ever, \\"Office Space\\" had an inauspicious run in theatres, only to absolutely explode on home video. Now with an enormous cult following, the film is still not receiving the accolades it deserves. In ten years, this movie will be looked upon as we look upon the all-time classics of comedy today. <br /> <br />Originally, a friend and I decided to see it because there was nothing else interesting playing at the cinemas. Imagine my surprise to be writing this years later, having seen the movie 20+ times, and having it on my personal top-10 list of all-time. <br /> <br />Buy it, watch it, love it. <br /> <br />Just don't touch my stapler.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|I remember it like it was yesterday;April 22, 1999. I was preparing to make a two day bus trip form the M-I-A(that's Miami for the urban slang challenged) to San Francisco. To reward myself for graduating early from college, I decided to attend Metallica's S&M concert, the joint venture with the San Francisco Symphony. Being a fan of Metallica and heavy metal for nearly 10 years( a black guy who adores hip hop), going to my first metal concert(and in this format, no less) would be a revelation, indeed. The second I stepped off the bus and to the Berkeley auditorium on the 24th, the adrenaline rush was moving. I didn't have to deal with a sub-par opening act; for the next three hours, it was all Metallica, all the time, and I couldn't have been happier. The show, like all Metallica shows, was tremendous; my only complaint is about the set list. When I heard that Metallica was preforming with an orchestra, I was estactic; the work from Metallica's 80's heyday was made for symphonic orientation, from the lightning-fast straight up rockers(Master Of Puppets, Battery, Disposable Heroes),half-ballad/half-thrash gems(One, Welcome Home Sanitarium,Fade To Black)to their slower but heavy songs(Enter Sandman, For Whom The Tolls, The Thing That Should Not Be). What's with the OVER abundance of songs from Load and Reload? To be honest, I don't mind songs like \\"Until It Sleeps\\"(my favorite 90's Metallica song)\\"hero Of The Day, \\"Fuel\\"(which got some added kick with the backing of the symphony) and \\"The Memory Remains\\", but Surely ythe band could have put some of their better songs in those spots. As a matter of fact, if I were in charge(which I should be of all that exists), this would be my set list: <br /> <br />Orion <br />The Call Of Ktulu <br />Master Of Puppets <br />Welcome Home Sanitarium <br />The Thing That Should Not Be <br />Fuel <br />The Memory Remains <br />Hero Of The Day <br />No Leaf Clover <br />Creeping Death(It's such a big fan favorite!) <br />Anesthesia(something for Jason Newsted since he has to pantomime through his performance of One, and we all know why) <br /> <br />Nothing Else Matters <br />Until It Sleeps <br />For Whom The Bell Tols <br />Ride The Lightning <br />The Unforgiven <br />Fade To Black(HOW COULD THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THIS?!!!) <br />One(best song on the album, period) <br />Enter Sandman <br />Battery <br />Damage,Inc.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|While \\"The Breakfast Club\\" doesn't touch the airy heights of near-perfection Hughes achieved with his masterpiece, \\"Sixteen Candles\\", it does stand the test of time as one of the true classics of the 1980s and teen movies in general. <br /> <br />The Breakfast Club is a collection of students thrust together by Saturday detention. These outcasts (yes, even Molly Ringwald is an outcast, in that she alone of the popular types she hangs with seems to actually have feelings) bond as the day drags on, propelled into friendship by shared experiences and shared intimacies. <br /> <br />They gradually become part of each other's world, by learning about their fears, their home lives, their dreams, and their talents (making odd sandwiches, rolling joints, applying lipstick with their breasts, etc). <br /> <br />It's a powerful movie John Hughes has made here - it's touching and triumphant in equal parts, angsty and heartfelt. It feels real, as one critic said. And that's the best compliment any movie (especially a teen movie) can get. <br /> <br />It feels real.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I became dazzled by this man and his music after a chance meeting while flying recently.  <br />We made pleasant conversation during the flight, and I made it a point to look him up on the web and then to buy his cds after learning more about him and I am now very thankful I can say I've met him. That chance meeting may well be the kind of story you tell your children about meeting one of the world's greats - and I believe it will be the case in this instance. <br />He was polite and funny and sincere and you could hear the pride he took in his music when he spoke of this cd, and I now can see he takes his craft very seriously and he has done a masterful job. <br />It's Time is a tribute to the artistry of a gifted singer and a surrounding cast of producers and musicians and is sure to be a best seller for many years.
B00005JKOI|3.0|1986 brought the third of three John Hughes / Molly Ringwald movies, \\"Pretty in Pink\\", and I'm afraid it's the worst of the three. <br /> <br />The storyline asks us to suspend disbelief over and over again, Molly's character seems weak and childish at times, and Jon Cryer is just annoying as the misfit \\"Duckie\\". <br /> <br />I am a huge Molly Ringwald fan, but \\"Pretty in Pink\\" is certainly a step down from the heights of \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and the pinnacle of \\"Sixteen Candles\\". <br /> <br />On a side note, Annie Potts is great (as usual) in a supporting role. <br /> <br />\\"Pretty in Pink\\" will be a necessary purchase for any 80s, Brat Pack, Hughes, or Ringwald fan, but it lacks a certain \\"something\\" that the other movies seem to have.
B000060K4O|5.0|\\"Ghostbusters\\" is my favorite movie of all time. I'd also rate it as the best comedy of all time. <br /> <br />There are no negatives here. I've seen it 60+ times, it holds up as well today as it did on that fateful day in May, 1984.  <br /> <br />This is also one of the best DVD packages of all time. Well worth the money, even if you already own the VHS version. Check out that extra features list! <br /> <br />If you like comedies, if you like science-fiction, heck, if you like MOVIES, you have to own this one.
B00065HKDY|5.0|Before I first watched &quot;I, Robot&quot; I was afraid it might have sold out as an action film. Thankfully I was wrong.<br />&quot;I, Robot&quot; contained an even balance of not only action, but psychology, sociolgy, philosophy, the clash of logic and emotions, life, and unconditional love. The movie made you think and feel with its knowledge, although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie's version of the future. Such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable.<br />If you watch this movie watch it not only for its action, but its beautiful philosophies. It can make anyone think. Or if you don't like to think, enjoy the action and seeing Will Smith naked in the shower (unless you don't swing that way). ;)
B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is one of those movies that doesn't come around very often. Written by Charlie Kaufman, this movie is a masterpiece in almost every aspect.<br /><br />The story is about a couple, Joel and Clementine (played by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, respectively). Like most couples, they have their problems. But unlike most couples, after a big fight, they both undergo a process that makes them forget each other ever existed.<br /><br />The majority of the film takes place in the mind of Joel while he is undergoing the process of forgetting Clementine. The story runs backwards, with him forgetting the most recent memories first, but it's not hard to follow.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is great. Carrey and Winslet are two of my favorite actors, and they both play their roles exquisitely. Winslet deserves that Oscar she's nominated for. This role is Carrey's best dramatic role to date. You do get some of his quirky humor, but it really fits.<br /><br />The direction of \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" is also spectacular. Michael Gondry did a great job of presenting Joel's thoughts and memories and transitioning between them.<br /><br />Overall, this film is very well-done, funny, sad, and touching. Everyone should check it out.
B00005K3NR|4.0|This is one of the most SCARIEST movies I have ever seen,and <br />I NEVER get scared during scary movies and I mostly just fall <br />asleep,but this time Carrie woke me up and scared me right out <br />of my seat.The story is based on one of Stephen King's frighting <br />novels and Stephen King is the MASTER of HORROR.Carrie(Sissy Spacek)is a sad and lonely teenager who has no friends,her mother is insane and all the girls always treat her like trash <br />and the only one who cares for her is Miss Collins(Betty Buckley).Miss Collins helps Carrie by punishing the girls who <br />were teasing Carrie and throwing things at her,just for having <br />alittle problem.Then one of the girls ask their boyfriend to ask <br />Carrie to the prom and not knowing why,Carrie said yes,BUT one <br />girl who was hurting Carrie the most has other plans in mine and <br />that's all I'm going to tell you befor I ruin the movie for you!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a movie you will either love or hate. There's no inbetween on this one.<br /><br />First of all, this movie was not made to make you feel good. It doesn't end happily ever after. It's brutal and it's real.<br /><br />\\"Requiem\\" follows a year in the lives of four people: Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans), and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn).<br /><br />In the beginning, all is well for the most part. Sara, a widow, lives by herself and is lonely, but perks up when she receives a call that she's been picked to be on television. She immediately decides to try to lose some weight so she can fit into the red dress that she had worn to Harry's graduation years earlier. She tries some diets, but none seem to work, so she goes to visit a specialist that gives her some pills. She begins to take them, and they seem to work like magic. She's losing a ton of weight.<br /><br />In the meantime, Harry and his friends decide they should try to earn some money by selling heroin. Marion wants to open her own clothing store, so they save up money in order to buy a building where she can set up shop.<br /><br />Everything is well.<br /><br />Then the characters begin their downward spiral to hell.<br /><br />This film, which is based off Herbert Selby Jr.'s novel, is masterfully powerful. Even if you hate the movie, it will affect you. The story is raw and emotional, revolting and gripping.<br /><br />Besides the powerful story, everything about the way the movie was made is what makes it great. Aronofsky's direction is phenomenal. He makes brilliant uses of split-screens and the sound effects and clips of the drug use are original and creative. The music in the movie, all orchestrated, is exquisite. It fits so perfectly with everything that is happening on screen. And the acting is also wonderful. Leto and Connelly both perform the best roles of their careers, in my opinion, and Wayans shows that he can really do drama. But it's Burstyn's performance that is the most outstanding. She really grips your heart and doesn't let it go throughout the whole film.<br /><br />While I don't claim that you will love this movie, I think everyone should watch it at least once and form their own opinion of it. It will unsettle you and it will make you think. And that's what makes it worth watching.hat he can really do drama. But it's Burstyn's performance that is the most outstanding.

B0002OERI0|1.0|Rebellious without actually alienating anyone. <br /> <br />American Idiot is not \\"politically charged\\", \\"Bush-bashing\\", \\"media-critiquing\\" or anything of the sort. It ambiguously criticizes American culture without really being specific about anything. \\"Don't wanna be an American idiot.\\" Who is going to get offended by that statement besides the absurdly conservative, patriotic Americans? Everyone agrees that America is full of idiots. Way to break new ground, Green Day. Oh, and that media that you hate so much? That media that you subtly bash in your music, though not blatantly enough that anyone will get offended? YOU ARE THAT MEDIA. You are the unoriginal, corporate excuse for music that plagues America nowadays. <br /> <br />Green Day, I think, can be compared accurately to a rollercoaster. Both appear scary, frightening and rebellious at first glance, but in reality, both are quite safe and inoffensive, perfect for family enjoyment as long as you meet the height requirement. This is just a calculated album aimed at the currently very large \\"Angry, rebellious American youth ages 11-24\\" demographic. <br /> <br />If this is what you call \\"politically charged punk rock\\", you need to break out and find some real music, by musicians who aren't afraid of offending fans and consequentially losing money from CD sales. Bands such as Dead Kennedys, Against Me!, Bad Religion, Death by Stereo and Propagandhi are real punk rock bands with real messages. WARNING: They might offend you if you're used to listening to music similar to Green Day. Prepare to be shocked by music that actually has some bite behind it, unlike this meaningless pseudo-rebellious filth.
B000002LEM|5.0|There is one name that remains controversial to some, but not all die hard Van Halen/David Lee Roth fans:Sammy Hagar.  There are even some die hard VH/DLR fans who won't listen to the Van Halen era with Sammy Hagar.  Well, that's really too bad, because these people don't know what they're missing out on(by saying this I am not being critical of any non Hagar fan in any way, shape, or form).  Van Halen's sophomore album with Sammy Hagar, \\"OU812\\" is even better than the first Van Halen album with Hagar, 1986's \\"5150\\".  \\"0U812\\" has ten songs, all of which are great.  This album has some of the best songs that Van Halen recorded with Sammy Hagar, such as \\"When It's Love\\", \\"Black and Blue\\", \\"Finish What Ya Started\\", among several other great songs.  Here is also an original Van Halen blues song, \\"A Political Blues\\".  Van Halen is great when it comes to playing rock music, but they are very good when it comes to blues. And not only is Eddie Van Halen a great songwriter/guitarist, he is also great when it comes to playing the piano.  You have to admire a rock band that can play a good blues song, especially when it is an original song by the group.  It's good to see that Sammy Hagar is finally back with Van Halen........now that Hagar is again Van Halen's lead singer, hopefully(and probably) Van Halen will put out a new studio album with Hagar.  \\"OU812\\" was the best album 1988 saw, along with KISS' \\"Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits\\" greatest hits album that had new studio music on it, Black 'n Blue's \\"In Heat\\", and The Vinnie Vincent Invasion's \\"All Systems Go\\".  A must have.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I recently purchased a used laserdisc player and all three original \\"Star Wars\\" films in their original theatrical versions. Why? Because of this monstrosity. Even the extras are dissapointing (I rented them off of Netflix) since the bulk is a 150-minute MTV-style documentary, about 10 minutes of which is actually interesting. Really, I'm a die-hard \\"Star Wars\\" fan but this won't ever be on my shelf. Pick up Lucas' \\"THX 1138\\" for an example of how an update should be done. Then again, Lucas should learn to listen to his fans more or just stop watching his own films. At the very least he could have put the original versions on here IN ADDITION TO the newer versions.
B000002UA0|4.0|I tell you, if you like Pink Floyd for just Dark Side Of The Moon, and anything that sounds somewhat similar to that, this is not for you.  I am a hardcore fan, and it still took me some time to warm up to this bunch of songs.  Dissonance, sound effects, and just plain wierd (or psychodelic, if you prefer) lyrics is what makes up THE PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN...anywho, everybody seems to like Astronomy Domine the best, but I'm more of a Lucifer Sam type o' guy (not that I like Lucifer...I'm actually a Christian), but this song doesn't seem to have anything to do with him, or am I just too naive to know?  Whatever.  Insterstellar Overdrive is some hot stuff too.  The main reason that I don't give this masterpiece five stars is just that there are too many un-good songs on here.  Matilda Mother, Flaming, Pow R. Toc H. are mediocre.  Chapter 24, Scarecrow just sound hollow and dull.  otherwise, the rest is pretty swell.  Overall, this album is very WAK!
0394800184|1.0|I know that my review will not please a lot of fans of this classic, but... <br /> <br />I have to say, this book's message is pretty out-dated, and rather insensitive to many modern families.  The baby bird goes up to various animals asking, \\"Are you my mother?\\"  The answer is invariably, \\"No.  You are a bird.  I am not a bird.\\"  What kind of message is that for a child?  Many children today do not look like their mothers at all! <br /> <br />A much better story is A Mother for Choco, about a little bird who wanders around, going up to every animal that bears some sort of resemblance to it.  In the end, it decides to live with Mrs. Bear who is also raising an alligator, a hippopotamus and a pig.    To me that is a much more beautiful message for children:  that a family doesn't have to be people who look alike.  A family is just people who love each other.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Ah!  This is definately a step up from Piper.  The opener is very chill, but eventually rocks out when the vocals come in.  That is quite neat-o if you ask me.  Remember A Day is kinda like whatever and so is See-Saw.  But Corporal Clegg is definately my favorite.  It has almost a Hendrix feel, but very Floydian of course.  It took me a long time to adjust to the title track.  with all the soundeffects and unstableness, it is hard to handle...but the end is MAGNIFICENT!  Also, I find this version very much better than that on Ummagumma (but it's good there too).  Definately my favorite of the Floyd's early years.  The music is there, the lyrics are fun, and whatever else...
B00028HBKM|5.0|Controversy.Truth.Faith.Love.Hate.Lies.Confusion.Anti-Semitic...One word summaries for what \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" meant to viewers all over the globe.It was a film studios rejected.A film that many award shows refused to acknowledge.But the public spoke when this film became box office history for sold out viewings world wide.But the movie is more than that.It is indeed like the title says \\"A Passion...\\"  <br /> <br />It's only ridiculous if you can say you loved or hated the film.Don't think because I'm rating the film 5stars that I loved it.It's a movie Mel Gibson risked his career for and in return garnered only more fame for.In that situation I applaud Mel for his releasing of this film.But one cannot ignore how it does show how much work and creation it took.Its beautiful scenery.The acting is magnificent.I do acknowledge this as work of extraordinary perfection.Whether the story is correct or not will always be up for debate among historians,philosophers, and the theologians for centuries to come. <br /> <br />
B00005K9LM|5.0|Defenders of the Faith in my opinion was Judas Priest's best album. I know everybody prefers British Steel, Painkiller, Screaming for Vengance and Turbo, but Defenders of the Faith is Judas Priest's most solid recording. The best songs on the album are: Freewheel Burning because Rob does a truly amazing vocals, Jawbreaker because the guitar solo is a true classic metal solo, The Sentinel because everything about it is good. This album is by far ahead of the rest and is classic metal at its best.
B00000055E|2.0|While 2pac's lyrics shine through the songs, over half of the songs are overly repeditive both with the beats (which are simple and sound the same), a voice you hear on songs and interludes which makes it sound like someone was inhaling a little too much laughing gas, and lyrics which are filled with \\"Bury me a G!\\" and \\"Thug Life Baby!\\"  <br /> <br />With stand out tracks \\"Nothing To Lose (Disk one)\\" and \\"I Wonder If Heaven Got A Ghetto (Hip-Hop version -- disk two),\\" it is still a nice CD, but I would recommend Better Dayz. The production is different which makes all the tracks stand out in thier own way and you will never put it down.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 5 year old son received this game as a present from my sister.  I also have a 6 1/2 year old son.  The two of them put down their gameboys and played this game with us over and over for two hours.     We've had the game for a week now and they are still asking to play.  It's a great introduction to building strategies and using their spacial abilities.  The rules are simple and the game itself goes fairly quickly which is great since my kids have a hard time sitting still for long.  If I had seen this at the store I probably would never have considered it, but I would recommend it to everyone now that we have played it.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This cd is great.Courtney's voice is real powerful on this album.Unlike Live Through This,this album has a couple of more positive songs on it.It is way more pop though unfortunatly because I like them more grunge.She is a great writer lyrics wise and the music they wrote was over average.This was my first album I bought from Hole and I think its a great starting point if you want to try it out.What I like about Hole is a guy can listen to it and not have a problem listening to it.When you think about it its way more rock than a lot of the bands out there today anyways heres what I say about each song: <br />Celebrity Skin - One of my favorite songs on it.10/10 <br />Awful-I thought this song was kind of funny in a way.Its also one of Courtney's favorites.10/10 <br />Hit So Hard-This song is a little dull to me but still ok 8/10 <br />Malibu-this was the third single its good for a ballad but then again I'm not into this kind of stuff 8/10 <br />Reason to Be Beautiful-this is one of the more heavier songs I like it 9/10 <br />Dying-this song is very quiet it gets a lot better at the end and the lyrics sound like Courtney put thought in this one 8/10 <br />...destroy-this is a pretty good song...9/10 <br />N.Star-the worst song on the album,its very dull  4/10 <br />BOTR-even though this is a ballad I like it 10/10 <br />Heaven Tonight-Good   8/10 <br />Playing Your Song-This is one of my favorites it has a chinese feel to the guitars and it hits harder than the rest 10/10 <br />Petals-a great way to end the album but kind of too repeative 8/10 <br /> <br />My favorite from them is Pretty in the Inside because I am into heavier stuff.Live Through This is more grunge and this cd is more pop/rock with a couple of grunge songs thrown in it.I believe Courtney is the smartest woman in rock because she is really singing ROCK and not just on acoustic guitar.Buy this $h*t!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is AMAZING!!!!!! The songs are AWESOME. I agree with everyone who rated this cd positivly. its so so so so so so good. you have to buy it. RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns n' Roses is my favorite band,made one of my favorite cds and it rocks my socks like no other.With Axl's strong powerful vocals Slash's talents on the giutar and the rest of the band they made a masterpiece.I would give this cd 10 stars if possible.Yeah it has a couple of downs and not every song is perfect but you can listen to it for a long time and rock out all you want.With classics like Welcome to the Jungle,Paradise City,Sweet Child o' Mine and Nighttrain I love this album.My favorite song is WTJ,a lot of people like PC more.The guitar is the best in PC but I just like WTJ more.Other songs I like are Mr.Brownstone,Its So Easy,My Michelle,Think About You,Anything Goes and Rocket Queen of course,do yourself a favor get your fat@$$ up and buy this cd.Recommended for any Metal fan.
019280264X|4.0|In this somewhat atypical Jane Austen novel, Austen abandons her precise characterization and carefully constructed plots, usually designed to illustrate specific ethical and social dilemmas, and presents a much broader, more complex picture of early nineteenth century life. Though the polite behavior of the middle and upper classes is always a focus of Austen, and this novel is no exception, she is more analytical of society as a whole here, casting a critical eye on moral issues which allow the upper class to perpetuate itself.<br /><br />Fanny Price, the main character, is the daughter of a genteel woman who married for love but soon found herself in poverty. When Fanny's aunt and uncle, the wealthy owners of Mansfield Park, invite Fanny alone, of all the children, to live with them, Fanny enters a new world, where she is educated, clothed, and housed, but always regarded as an \\"outsider.\\"<br /><br />Through Fanny's two cousins, Maria and Julia, Austen shows the complex interactions of the upper class as they negotiate marriages, try to maintain the family's reputation and wealth, and react to those \\"beneath\\" them socially. Fanny, having experienced both poverty and plenty, comments on what she sees, and though she lacks the witty charm of some of Austen's other characters (such as Elizabeth Bennett), she shows an intelligence and conscience lacking among her cousins. Only Edmund, the youngest of the Bertram sons, pays genuine attention to her, and her love for him is real, though secret.<br /><br />This is a darker novel than Austen's others, showing conflicts between late eighteenth century rationalism and the growing romanticism of the nineteenth century.  Often unfeeling toward his own family, Sir Thomas also shows cruelty toward Fanny when she rejects a marriage he has negotiated for her to a man she does not love. Cousin Maria chooses to marry Rushworth for his fortune, but she succumbs to her passion for someone else, and introduces a romantic, new sexuality into the novel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Fanny, though sweet and reasonable, is also quiet and predictable, while Edmund, the only other potentially empathetic character, is naïve and often appears to be weak. Austen's light touch and quiet humor, which make her other novels vibrate with life and come to a satisfying ending, are less obvious here, and the abrupt conclusion leaves many questions unanswered.

6305308659|5.0|After you hold your breath, suspend your disbelief, and make the leap through your television screen, you realize that technical savvy is not the only thing going for this film. As it dovetails the dual tropes of time travel and alternate reality, it creates a clever sketch of timeless social issues.<br /><br />Two modern teenagers land up in the parallel universe of a 1950's (and thus B&W) television sitcom called Pleasantville, named after the straight-laced town where it is based. Think ice cream parlors, ponytail girls in poodle skirts, Have-Another-Meatloaf moms in aprons, Honey-I'm-Home dads in prim suits, the whole staid shebang of Father Knows Best.<br /><br />Slowly but surely our teenagers find themselves baffled as they discover this black or white world where everything comes in simple cans of right or wrong. You sort of know what will happen from here on, they will gradually emancipate this folk stuck in a social tapeloop and put the whole town on the path to a messy and deeply flawed, but democratic, creative and infinitely layered progress.<br /><br />Thematically this may sound frugal but it's a technical marvel to behold. Some sleek digital FX deftly blends vivid color and B&W images in each shot as our 50s society comes alive in fits and starts, like leaves in autumn. Fascinating cinematic accomplishment.<br /><br />Yet the film draws such bipolar reviews because it's loaded with moral tidings. It's about living life to the fullest, heeding to heart's desires, and taking the good with the bad instead of sweeping things under the rug and acting 'pleasant' all the time. Having passion brings with it positives and negatives, but suppressing true feelings for the sake of fictitious harmony makes for an empty life.<br /><br />Which is a relevant, timeless message. We resist change. Pleasantville suggests that changing and growing as a people, even falteringly, is important. Just because the 50s were used as a metaphor for this message, don't believe for a minute this isn't a universal issue that exists today and forever.<br /><br />While some questions are raised and left dangling, like that of premarital promiscuity (one of our protagonist teenagers is less than discreet), I still find it bizarre that some reviewers managed to spot racism in this perfectly sane film. Perhaps it's time for them to leave their cubbyholes and stop watching Amistad re-runs.<br /><br />Acting wise, the entire cast is right-on. Maguire is convincing as the spokesperson who lashes out in favor of modernity. Witherspoon looks outstanding in black and white, and then makes red angora sweaters look better than anyone this side of Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice. Veterans Will Macy and Joan Allen look like they were born to play Mom and Dad.<br /><br />Difficult as it is for a film so brimming with social connotations to boast universal adoration, I was utterly floored by it and couldn't recommend it highly enough to the discerning viewer. Delectable blend of nostalgia and pansophy.a minute this isn't a universal issue that exists today and forever.<br /><br />While some questions are raised and left dangling, like that of premarital promiscuity (one of our protagonist teenagers is less than discreet), I still find it bizarre that some reviewers managed to spot racism in this perfectly sane film.

0425152251|4.0|\\"Sophie's World\\" is a truly unique novel, unlike any other I've read. What Jostein Gaarder has done here is to write a history of philosophy in clear, simple language, and framed the whole thing in one cohesive narrative. Sophie Amundsen, the title character, is a 14-year-old girl in Norway. One day, arriving at home after school, she finds a mysterious letter in her mailbox. The slip of paper inside says only \\"Who are you?\\" A short while later she receives another, this one asking \\"Where does the world come from?\\" After this she regularly finds such letters, addressed to herself, containing short, written lectures on philosophy. At the same time, however, she begins to receive mail addressed to \\"Hilde Moller Knag, c/o Sophie Amundsen.\\" But Sophie has never heard of Hilde before. So why is she receiving birthday cards from Hilde's father? The two sets of mysterious letters are linked in some way, but how?<br /><br />The plot, actually, is a secondary aspect of the book. \\"Sophie's World\\" is really an introductory philosophy course, suitable even for students of junior high school age (it is also, however, well worth the time to read for anyone interested in beginning to learn about philosophy, including adults of all ages). But it is really only an introduction - anyone who already has at least a basic knowledge of philosophy will not find anything new here. The book provides an overview of most of the major Western philosophers in easy-to-comprehend language, with plenty of examples. However, \\"Western\\" is the key term here. Eastern and other philosophies are occasionally briefly alluded to, but never discussed in any detail at all. Topics covered include the Natural Philosophers, Democritus, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Cynics, the Stoics, the Epicureans, Neoplatonism, Mysticism, Jesus of Nazareth, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Renaissance Humanism, Copernicus and Galileo, Luther, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume, Berkeley, the Deists, Kant, the Romanticists, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Existentialism. Other philosophers and movements are mentioned in passing, but not discussed at length.<br /><br />What makes \\"Sophie's World\\" so accessible, however, is the plot framing it. Without a plot to keep things moving, a subject like this could easily become dry. But Gaarder's book is anything but dry. Not only does Sophie continue to get mysterious cards and letters from Hilde's father, but she also begins to find items belonging to this unknown girl. Some of them even show up right in Sophie's bedroom! The tension increases as these incidents become more frequent, and progressively stranger. It becomes apparent that Sophie and her philosophy teacher must work together to unravel the mystery in a very short time, or face disastrous consequences. About halfway through the book, there is a radical twist that will initially set your head spinning, and then make you start to question your own reality!<br /><br />I was not entirely pleased with the way the book is wrapped up. It almost seemed to get a little too fanciful, less plausible and less based in solid philosophy. The last few chapters seemed somewhat anticlimactic, almost as if Gaarder himself wasn't sure how best to bring the book to a close. However, he really does make you look at the world and think about the concept of existence in what, for most of us, is a totally revolutionary way. And, of course, it is a great way for those new to philosophy to get their feet wet without being too overwhelmed. The book is long - more than 500 pages - but it is easy reading. The language is not difficult, and the philosophical concepts have been greatly simplified (you will want to move on to other sources for a fuller understanding of these concepts if you find you are still interested in philosophy upon completing this book). And if you need time to digest any of the information, the book is conveniently layed out so as to provide plenty of good stopping places. On the whole, a solid and worthwhile book for beginning philosophers.le, a solid and worthwhile book for beginning philosophers.
B00030590I|3.0|The special effects, the cinematography, and the sound are exceptional in this movie. The fight scenes, as they are in all martial arts movies of this type, are highly choreographed. Some of them could be executed in the real world, but others have never been observed, and no doubt supposed to exemplify the ancient mythology of Chinese \\"inner strength\\". Physical laws are to be ignored in these scenes, as such realism would be contrary to the purpose of the movie: to glorify human conflict and smooth over its horrors. Mythology and an exaggerated sense of purpose are what cause many to willingly participate in activities that are to their detriment. It is difficult to face death without a banner or set of symbols, or a promise of heavenly rewards. But the momentum of real arrows is not deflected by fanciful choreography. They draw blood regardless of the wishes of their targets. No amount of mental concentration will deflect their parabolic trajectories. In real battle, gravity cannot be defied as it is in the elaborate bodily movements of this film. Gravity is democratic in pulling all down whose hearts are pierced with an arrow. So are there heroes on both sides of a conflict as claimed in the beginning notes of the movie? Not likely, as war should be viewed as a necessity, as a last resort, and is never to be glorified or elevated. It is by far the worst activity humans can indulge themselves in, and if there are real heroes, it is those who bring war to an end.<br /><br />Due to its rising importance in the modern world, it is now imperative to undertake a thorough and exhaustive study of Chinese history, to learn the Chinese language, and to understand Chinese philosophy and Chinese cultural traditions, especially how the latter influences business decisions. This film brings up a few ideas that seem to conflict with some of the Western viewpoints of Chinese culture and history. For example, Chinese women in this film are portrayed as strong and independent, and as formidable warriors. Is this the way they are viewed in China? Or is it more accurate to view them as the foot-bound maidservants as they have been typically portrayed in the West? In addition, the cultures of the West are led to believe that the Chinese are a contemplative people. The philosophy of Confucius for example is presented as one that reinforces this view. A large degree of profundity is imputed to his analects. Only a rigorous study of Chinese history will allow one to make conclusions on his influence. If it is indeed a philosophy of contemplation and pacifism it is certainly not apparent in this film. The film therefore could be viewed as inspiration for obtaining a true understanding of the Chinese people and their belief structures, not as it is portrayed in movies, but how it really is, without masks and without exaggerations. Such a project is a challenging one, but well worth the effort and time.rmidable warriors. Is this the way they are viewed in China?

0452282152|5.0|\\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" is based on the Johannes Vermeer painting with the same name. Sixteen-year-old Griet is forced to leave home and go to work as a maid for a painter and his family in order to provide for her family. Although she faces numerous challenges with most members of the Vermeer household, Griet slowly begins to bond with her master, who commissions her to help him in his studio and eventually has her sit for one of his paintings.<br /><br />This book is interesting on many different levels.  For one thing, creating this fictitious tale based on such a famous piece of art is intriguing, and Tracy Chevalier's characters are all very believable. Having the story narrated from Griet's point of view was also an excellent choice. The reader is treated to a description of how life was for a young woman living in poverty during the 17th century. Griet is forced into so much during the course of this novel, and all her options seem vert limited: there could be serious consequences if she continues to work for the Vermeer family, but her family will starve if she chooses to leave. There is also the potential of romance with a young suitor, but Griet is torn between a \\"sensible\\" relationship with Pieter and the growing feeling she has for her master.<br /><br />The relationship between Griet and Vermeer is very mysterious and still leaves a lot of questions until the very end. We become aware of Griet's feelings for her master, but how does Vermeer really feel about her?  Griet's interaction with the other women is also interesting to follow...Vermeer's wife sees her as a threat, Tanneke sees her as a rival, and Cornelia sees her as someone to destroy. The relationships between all of the women in her life escalate as the story progresses, which makes the final confrontation in the last few pages of the book even more powerful.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" to anyone. Now that I've read the novel, I am very eager to see the movie version...hopefully Hollywood didn't butcher it beyond repair. :)movie version...hopefully Hollywood didn't butcher it beyond repair. :) <br />
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I can't believe that someone would actually give this album a bad rating, although I read a good many good reviews too, but that just baffles me. Of all the Pat Metheny Group albums that I've heard, this one has had one of the strongest impacts on me. \\"Speaking of Now\\" was a fantastic album, but this one really is something that just hits you hard. At first listen, it's hard to catch all of the wonderful things this music has hidden and layered in it, but that's one of the reasons I keep coming back to this album.<br /><br />This album's music is hard to pin down, but I guess I'd call it progressive jazz, simply for the structure of the songs. It's almost laid out like a concept album. It has a major theme and everything is centered with this theme in mind, although, this group of musicians aren't afraid to take the concept out of context on occasion.<br /><br />The musicians for this album are as follows:<br /><br />Pat Metheny - guitar, guitar synth<br /><br />Lyle Mays - piano, synthesizer<br /><br />Cuong Vu - trumpet, voice<br /><br />Steve Rodby - bass, cello<br /><br />Gregoire Maret - harmonica<br /><br />If you do not have this album in your Pat Metheny collection my only question is what are you waiting for?
B00005U122|5.0|OK that's three words, but a DVD this great can't be summed up easily.  Especially to think you can pick this up for less than $10, it's unbelievable. What a great group of musicians and a great collection of songs.  Really, REALLY well done.  Ok, the documentary is inadequate, but who cares!  The performance is what counts.  I bought this and watched it 3 nights in a row.  Even my wife, who is a so-so classic rock fan, sat through all three playings.  If you don't have it, order it now!!<br /><br />Update:  Several months later, this remains my favorite concert DVD and I have about 40 of them now.  I just can't explain to you how good this is.  Buy it and see for yourself!!!

B00005Y1UX|4.0|I've read some reviews after watching this movie and I feel honestly that many people were way off the mark at what this movie was really about. Demi Moore never really loved the billionare and although yes he succeeded in seducing her and she did 'love' him more as a friend than anything else it becomes pretty apparent that she never trully loved the billionare. She diffenately begins to realize this near the end. Some people think that she just felt guilt over what she was doing to her husband but sorry that's not all it was. She loved her husband beyond what she could ever feel for the billionare no matter how much money he had. <br /> <br />The main theme of this movie I think that many people over look is that money for all it can buy can never buy happiness. Someone wrote a review saying that their was no way that the husband could never compete with the billionare for her love. I'd say the ending would say that assumption was very wrong.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This movie scared the living daylights out of me.  The bad guy was so twisted and evil that I won't forget him for a while.  I felt the acting was quite good also.  The premise of waking up and finding yourself chained up with no memory of how you got there kind of reminded me of Cube, which is another great film if you haven't seen it.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|This movie is uniquely in a class unto itself.  Shot in rural Preston, Idaho people of all geographic locales will find something to connect to in this curious and original film.  It is part Raising Arizona, part high school nerd story like sixteen candles.  The main character will leave you wondering...\\"what does that actor really act like in real life?\\"  Jon Heder plays the dislocated Napolean to such an uncomfortable nerdy T that you are hard pressed to imagine the guy acting like anything else.<br /><br />It will be hard not to laugh at a good bit of the dialogue in the movie especially when Rex's Kwon Do, says, \\"Do you think anyone would want a roundhouse kick to the head when I'm wearing pants like these?\\" in his MC Hammer baggy US flag pants.  The whole of the movie is so understated and quirky.  High School angst has an innocent face and you find yourself caring for the outcomes of Pedro, Napolean, and Deb's lives while laughing and laughing.<br /><br />Napolean's 32 year old live at home brother finds love on-line and Tawonda shows up via Greyhound and brings a whole new life to a once social recluse.  It is that innocence that nobody, regardless of their geekiness, is beyond the human connection and potential for happiness in the presence of others that utimately make \\"Napolean Dynamite,\\" such an enjoyable watch.<br /><br />You will be watching this one, listening for the lines, memorizing them, to repeat your favorite Dynamite lines back in the company of friends.  And it all took place in the Gem state but you will recognized elements of your hometown, your High School, and your friends.  As Jimmy Walker once said, \\"It's dyno-miiite!!!\\"<br /><br />--MMW
B000002549|3.0|I wouldn't say I'm a fan. I only own two of her cd's. 'Barbara Joan Steisand' and this one. They are both different and because of that I like them. I feel she is often overated. She tries too hard, maybe. She is not \\"over the top\\"; nor does she try to be on this one. Whether your a fan or not, try this one out. It's good. It will surprise you. A classic!?
B00008J4P5|5.0|I bought this cd with low expectations, I was merely looking for something new, and grabbed this off the shelf. Was I surprised. Their opening song, Seven Nation Army, has one of the most addictive guitar riffs i have heard in a long time.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Been listening to Ray since I was a small boy. I could tell he was weak from sickness. His voice is not quite as strong as it once was, but its still wonderful to hear him with the great talent on this CD. What a legacy he has left us. Thanks Ray.
B000096I9G|5.0|I want to clear somethng up here. The reviewer below who said that the notes in \\"closedown\\" (one of my personal favorites)were \\"off key\\" is just wrong, and obviously doesn't understand musical terms. While the notes on the keyboard ARE different than on the album, that doesn't make them \\"off key\\" There are many notes that you can use in a scale and still be in key. Being OFF key would mean playing a note OUT of the scale, or one that is not in tune with the rest of the song.  <br />What kind of idiot are you trying to make Robert Smith look like by saying he didn't catch the change in the keys before he could \\"edit\\" the video? This is a man who has been writing music professionally for almost 30 years; a man who records, sequences, programs and masters countless numbers of tracks in his own home studio. And you're sitting here telling people that YOU caught an error in HIS music that he let slide? Give me a break.  <br />I know that it can be dissapointing to people to hear their favorite bands play a song differently in a live show when they're so used to hearing it the way they have for years on an album. Sometimes the song just doesn't have the same effect.  <br />But you have to understand, performing a song the exact same way for YEARS and YEARS can probably get very tiring and boring. Musicians sometimes just need to use their creativity and try new things - but that doesn't make playing a different note a mistake.  <br /> <br />For the record, the keyboards are also different (on this video and other live performances as well) on other songs including \\"lovesong\\"   <br /> <br />This video is a MUST HAVE for cure fans. I am going to watch again right now :) <br /> greg
B00005JNEW|4.0|Friday Night Lights gives a good picture of small-town Texas where high school football is the most exciting thing around.  The whole town feels ownership in the team, and people don't hesitate to tell the coaches what to do, and the players, how to do it.  The end result, especially in a town like Odessa, where past successes fuel future aspirations, is a coach and players who are in a constant pressure-cooker.  The movie illustrates the different reactions which individuals have to these pressures.  Billy Bob Thorton, as the coach, is unfailingly polite to the townspeople, even when they track him down outside of Wal-Mart to give him advice.  He cares more about the boys' character than how many games they win, an attitude which is not always popular in Odessa.  His star player is a cocky young man who puts all of his hopes on obtaining a college scholarship and eventually playing in the pros.  When an injury ends this dream, he is shattered.  The quarterback is sincere and hard-working and loves football, but he hates the pressure of winning.  Another of the young players is constantly harrassed by his father who won a state championship and will stand for nothing less from his son.  This is an exciting sports movie which clearly demonstrates the problems with the \\"win at all costs\\" mentality.

1881273156|5.0|After many years as a marriage counselor, Gary Chapman began noticing patterns in the way couples interact with each other.  Although one or both partners might be trying to please their mate and make their marriage better, somehow their efforts were falling short.  He noticed that after the first blush of romantic love begins to fade, couples are often unsuccessful in keeping the loving and affectionate feelings alive in their marriage.  He concluded that each of us has a \\"love language\\", which is based on a need within us which must be filled in order for us to feel loved.  This love language is part of us early in life and seems to continue to adulthood.  In order for us to effectively love our spouse, we must be tuned in to his/her \\"love language\\".  The love languages include quality time, words of affirmation, gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.  Often people intuitively know which is their love language but for those who don't, Gary Chapman provides a questionnaire which will help each person identify which one is primary for him/her.  He has a chapter explaining each love language and how you can speak this language to your spouse.  If both partners are committed to making their marriage better, Chapman's case studies show this is an effective way for them to minister to each other and improve their communication and interactions.
B000002L7Y|4.0|It's funny. I've learnt very recently that in the US, a-ha is considered as a one-hit wonder. Here in Europe, they are one of the most popular bands of the 80's. And to me, they have been the band that awoke my interest in pop/rock music with their 3rd album when I was ten.     The one here, \\"Hunting High and Low\\", was their first, published in 1985 and sold extremly well, thanks to the worldwide hit \\"Take on Me\\" and its brilliant video. But this song is far from reflecting the entire album musically. Although still in its infancy, their darker pop tone, that will appear full-force on their following release, \\"Scoundrel Days\\", can already be guessed at here from time to time. The lyrics are relatively weak (English being, after all, only their second language), but the depths to which they can take their music at times, while still remaining whithin the realms of pop, the quality of the production, and the voice (one of the most beautiful of the last 25 years) more than make up for it, even at this early stage of their carrier.    1. Take on Me: well, what do you want me to say. Not my favorite song, not by a long shot but, let's face it, it's one of those tunes you cannot actually not enjoy. It's light, it's fun, and it works, and because of that, it deserves to be among the most popular songs of the 80s. 8/10    2. Train of Thought: This song is the kind that, when you close your eyes to, you have the impression that you're either in a train or on a motorcycle, and the speed is building until you reach a certain plateau. That's pretty much what happens to the rythm of that song. Nice, and IMO, already a lot more interesting musically than the preceeding one. 7,5/10    3. Hunting High and Low: In a fair and perfect world, this would have been their one worldwide hit. This song has everything going for it: it's beautifully crafted while still remaining very accessible and makes for a good single (it actually was their third). It's melancholic, moody, and Harket putsa real emotionally-driven vocal performance. The real jewel of the crown. 10/10     4. A Blue Sky: this one is stuck in the worst place of all, in between \\"Hunting High....\\" and \\"Living a boy's....\\", which, by comparison, make this one sound like a sweet little interlude. But it eventually grows on you, insiduously: there's nothing exceptional, nothing remarkabe in itself, but again, it works. 7/10    5. Living a Boy's Adventure Tales: This song is the proof that a-ha could already reach places no other group that had been compared to them could even conceive. Morten Harket's voice really flies, literally, to new heights, and it suddenly takes a new dimension. 10/10    6. The Sun Always Shine on TV: a-ha's second single. I used to love it, but I got tired of it eventually. It sounds to me also as if this one couldn't pass the test of time as well as most others. Well sung, well produced, but nothing remarkable in those departments either. 5,5/10    7. And You Tell Me: you know, I've come to wonder if there was in their contract a clause saying that in each album, they had to have a bland song. Because everytime it's the case. Here, this spot is filled by \\"And you tell me\\".  Sweet, but highly forgetable. 3/10     8. Love is Reason: It won't make music's history, but it's already a few feets above \\"And you Tell Me\\". It's typically the kind of song you'd expect from an entertaining 1st pop album. 6/10    9. I Dream Myself Alive: here music takes off again. It's pop, but with a twist. You expect the atmosphere to lighten up any second, but it never does. It takes a few listenings to get used to, but you eventually embrace it for what it is. Intriguing. 7,5/10    10. Here I Stand and Face the Rain: I love how it starts: the voice lost from afar, the guitar. I love the fact that there's something dark and almost menacing throughout the song. I love how it ends with the voice fading away, back to the mist, as if it all had been a dream, an hallucination. This last track is a good end, and even more so, a good transition to the sound of \\"Scoundrel Days\\" 9/10    Overall, I rate this album: 7,5/10
0618001905|4.0|This is an extremely readable book, but its title is deceptive.  While the full title is King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa, the book is not about Africa at all.  Instead, the vast majority of this book is about diplomacy and protest movements in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United States with regards to Belgian rule in Congo.  If you pick this book up looking to find the details of the governance and rule of the Congo Free State or the history of the major rebellions against Belgian rule, you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />This is not a criticism of the author, who likely didn't select his own title anyway.  If you look at the book from the standpoint of what Hochschild wanted to write, it is a good but not great work.  Hochschild was mostly interested in European/American personalities and focuses on them instead of a chronology of events either in the West or in Africa.  At times, this makes the book confusing, as Hochschild does not use a lot of dates to help the reader sort out the order of events.  On the other hand, the personalities of the day are vivid and fascinating.  Hochschild has mined the vast majority of the available evidence to give us stunningly detailed (and at times salacious) details on King Leopold and his major opponents.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important feature of Hochschild's writing is that he doesn't shy away from the imperfections of his heros or try to brush away the moral ambiguities of his subject.  He is the first to admit that slavery was a problem even before the first major European contact with central Africa even while showing how the European/American system was far more pernicious and devastating than anything the natives had devised.  He acknowledges that some of his protagonists are conceited and provides the background to show why they became so; this makes the ultimate sacrifices of some of his heroes that much more significant.<br /><br />Hochschild is a journalist by training, and this explains many of the strengths and weaknesses of King Leopold's Ghost.  The two main strengths are this books readability and accessibility.  I am not normally a fast reader but I flew through this book thanks to its clear prose and Hochschild's highly developed sense of irony.  I also read this book as someone who knows relatively little about African history, but I never felt as though Hochschild was either condescending or assuming a level of knowledge that the average reader would not have.<br /><br />However, there are some weaknesses that result from the journalistic style as well.  Most significant of these is the relative paucity of bibliographic information, as Hochschild only provides specific sourcing to direct quotations.  Hochschild is the first to admit that it is nearly impossible to find African sources for his material, but that makes the identities of those sources that much more interesting, especially for readers who want to learn more about the subject at hand.  Finally, this is likely a book that will not interest experts on African history, both because of its superficial treatment of what actually happened in Africa and because of the lack of analysis of the causes of events other than psychological sketches of Leopold, his supporters, and his opponents.<br /><br />That said, this is a superior work overall.  If, like me, you read Heart of Darkness in a high school English class without getting any of the background on Conrad's time, you will find this work to be revelatory.  Even if you have only a passing interest in Africa, you will find yourself more intrigued by its history when you finish than when you started.ld is a journalist by training, and this explains many of the strengths and weaknesses of King Leopold's Ghost.

B0006SSOHC|3.0|I was beyond interested in this film and got it right when it entered the video rental store. The entire film appeared to be so eeriee and I needed to know what was going on.  <br />I must say this film was a heart- stopping thriller. They cut to the chase right at the beginning of the film with the main character Adam waking up in an old bathroom chained to a pipe and across the room from him is a doctor whom says he just woke up himself and he is chained to a pipe as well. In the middle of the floor between them is a corpse that shot himself. Which tells you whoever put them down there means lethal business. A series of clues they find in that one bathroom leads them to find out much about what is going to happen to them and it doesn't look good on either side. I won't give anything away because the movie is just full of surprises and the viewer should be as shocked as I was in every one of them.  <br />Why this film is only given a three? Well in some parts of the film they really try to scare you by making some scenes go really quick and I found that a little tacky. At the end once more they gave you a cliff- hanger and like I mentioned probably in many films I don't really like that but the ending is really good and may I add nauseating because the doctor does something very horrific and I don't even want to think on it. You can see it for yourself. Just don't be eating dinner while watching it.  <br />The gist of this film? You'll never guess the ending. You can sit here now and think on it as hard as I did throughout the movie but you'll never figure out the ending. It is beyond twisted and you'll just be sitting there at the end in deep shock. Obviously the ending proves there will be a sequel so do not worry- the shock will only grip us till the second comes out.

068987474X|3.0|He's Just Not That Into You is a self-help guide for single women written by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo, consultant and executive story editor, respectively, for the HBO comedy Sex and the City. He's Just Not That Into You advises women not to make excuses for men who don't call, won't commit, say they just want to be friends, etc. The bottom line is that if a man is behaving in one of the ways described in this book, it is simply because \\"he's just not that into you.\\" <br /> <br />The book's chapters have catchy titles such as \\"He's Just Not That Into You If He's Not Asking You Out\\" and \\"He's Just Not That Into You If He Doesn't Want to Marry You.\\" The chapters are divided into sections with each excuse a woman might make to explain a man's questionable behavior. For example, for chapter one (\\"He's Just Not That Into You If He's Not Asking You Out\\"), there is \\"The `Maybe He Doesn't Want to Ruin the Friendship'\\" excuse and \\"The `Maybe He's Intimidated by Me'\\" excuse. Behrendt proceeds to hilariously dispute each of these excuses by answering a hypothetical letter from a female asking for his advice. At the end of each chapter, Tuccillo makes her contribution in a section entitled \\"Here's Why This One is Hard\\" in which she gives the female perspective of why women find Behrendt's answers presented in the current chapter so difficult to accept. Each chapter also contains a section at the end called \\"This is What It Should Look Like\\" in which Behrendt and Tuccillo take turns giving an example of an actual couple they know who are involved in a healthy, satisfying relationship. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book because it has such practical advice, yet it's an easy, lighthearted read. In fact, it's absolutely hilarious. Take, for example, Behrendt's explanation of why a man doesn't call:  <br /> <br />Oh, sure, they say they're busy. They say that they didn't have even a moment in their insanely busy day to pick up the phone. It was just that crazy. Bulls-t. With theadvent of cell phones and speed dialing it is almost impossible not to you call. Sometimes I call people from my pants pocket when I don't mean to. <br /> <br />My reservation about Behrendt and Tuccillo's book is that it can hardly be considered a self-help manual. Behrendt's only credentials for giving advice is that he's a male who is in touch with how men think and operate. Furthermore, it isn't written in a professional manner; in fact, it's downright crass. Yes, I know it is meant to be humorous--which it is--but is it really necessary to use four-letter expletives and crude references to sexual intercourse? But then again, considering that these two worked for Sex and the City, it is probably to be expected. <br /> <br />Some of the scenarios presented are ones to which I can relate so well as a single woman. There are others, however, that make no sense to me at all. If a woman is hanging around a man who is belligerent, unfaithful, or married, she needs far more help than this book can possibly provide. Reading another type of self-help book or even attending a few sessions of therapy might be in order. But for any single woman out there who has ever wondered why a man doesn't call back or seems only half-heartedly interested, I recommend it for a funny, light read. (By the way, though this is presented by a man for women, a similar version could easily have been written for men. It is not just men who play these games. Women have similar ways of showing a man that she's \\"just not that into you.\\") <br /> <br />There is one more caveat: This book is so short (it can easily be read in an hour) that is not worth $19.95. I recommend that anyone interested in this book do as I did: Save your hard-earned money and borrow it from your local public library.
B0002S947K|5.0|I stumbled across Ray LaMontagne performing Trouble on Late Night with Conan O'Brien....and was stunned...it's been a while since a song sent shivers down my spine. I was straight onto the net to find out about this guy and ordered the CD...and it didn't disappoint. There will be comparisons with Van Morrison but his voice is unique. This album is simply amazing...Jolene is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard in my life. With his voice you have to ask, where has he been all this time....I can't wait for the next instalment....one of the best albums I've bought in many many years.
B0006SSOHM|4.0|I liked this movie a lot, I don't get all the negative reviews. However, I have a different complaint than most people though: I would really have liked to see more people fall victims of this killers elaborate traps (I would have liked to seen more traps) More gore please. Even though it did give some good gore, it just teased me. <br />I think people didn't like this movie because of the ending, which I liked a lot. Or people are just crying because they couldn't figure out the ending. You cannot win, people either cry when a movie is predictable, or they cry when it doesn't follow the norm. Make up your mind morons. Anyway, it filled part of my gore meter, so I was happy with it. Loved the ending <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Well, despite the fact that they mispronounce the name \\"Menelaus\\" throughout the entire film ( ...It's \\"Men-uh-LAY-uss,\\" not \\"Men-uh-LOWSE,\\" you sunbaked Hollywood airheads!!  Just crack open a dictionary sometime, fercrissake...) and despite an inaccuracy or two here and there... (Didn't Ajax die after Achilles?  Like, didn't he scoop his armor up off the beach, and all that...? ) and despite the fact that hardly anyone on this film looks even remotely Greek... and despite the film giving the impression that a torturous ten-year war took place in the span of a few weeks...  Despite all that, this film was still fun, about as good a sword-and-sandal epic as we're likely to get in this day and age.  Brad Pitt, though buff as can be, perhaps isn't the greatest choice as Achilles, but Eric Bana is surprisingly moving as Hector, the champion of Troy, investing him with a tremendous pathos... The script is fairly tight, the sets look grand, the computer generated armies aren't too mechanical, the violence has heft.  In short, it works as an action film.<br /><br />That being said, the screenwriters and producers should be ashamed or at least abashed at how they distorted the Greek legends and bent history to fit their narrative scope.  The prime example of this is the melodramatic slaying of King Agamemnon at the film's climax:  Agamemnon actually returned from the Trojan War and was later slain in a palace intrigue.  His murder was the source of an entirely separate drama, and monkeying with the details of his death is a particularly egregious untruth.<br /><br />I weary of Hollywood writers who defend their despoiling of history by saying, \\"oh look, it's just a movie and I can write it any way I want to...\\" It's one thing to elide past peripheral events or omit facts that bog a story down, another thing altogether to willfully change the facts entirely.  Not only is it simply evil and wrong to rewrite history, it's just plain lazy.  They may claim that they are professionals who know how best to tell a story, but c'mon: if you can't figure out how to come up with a proper dramatic ending using the real story of \\"The Iliad,\\" then you just aren't as skilled a craftsman as you'd like us to believe.  You're just a hack with a tight deadline. And in the case of the Iliad in particular, it's not \\"just a movie.\\" This is probably the only version of this story -- one of the world's most important historical narratives -- that most people in our demi-literate pop culture will ever learn: couldn't you at least make the effort to get the details straight?  Is it really that hard?  Do you really gain that much dramatically by screwing up our perception of history?  Fie, a pox apon you lazy Hollywood twits.  If you can't be bothered to present history accurately, then don't choose an historical story to tell.professionals who know how best to tell a story, but c'mon: if you can't figure out how to come up with a proper dramatic ending using the real story of \\"The Iliad,\\" then you just aren't as skilled a craftsman as you'd like us to believe.

Stone Cold Steve Austin. Not that good of a match overall but I did want Lesnar to win so he would stay. Sadly Brock Lesnar left after this but it would be nice to see him at Wrestlemania 21. Eddie vs. Kurt Angle a very funny match and a great ending. Also the return of the Undertaker! I was very happy to see him back. Undertaker vs. Kane. The last event of the night was the Triple Threat Match between Triple H, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels. A very exciting match and bloody. The winner was Benoit. He put up one hell of a fight to win it. I've left out some of the other ok matches but there was never a bad moment. I fully recommend buying this.

B0001IN0DA|5.0|Wrestlemania XX was an excellent card. I see why in the last few years, it is the Super Bowl of wrestling. This is definitely worth viewing. The special features and extras are worth seeing. The pay-per-view itself was almost 4 hrs. The extras are about 2 hrs for a total of 6 hrs viewing on 3 discs.  <br />    The extras include an awesome documentary about Wrestlemania XIX that let's you see the real guys behind the characters. Wrestlemania's 10 Greatest Matches hosted by Ric Flair was good. The gallery and trivia are for any wrestling fan old enough to have seen all 20 Manias. <br />    The Card: <br />United States Championship: <br />Big Show vs John Cena 8/10 <br />  An excellent way to kick off the PPV.

Better than I thought it would be. RVD & Booker make a great team. Should have left Cade & Jindrak out of this match. <br /> <br />Christian vs Chris Jericho 8/10 <br />   Any match with Y2J is usually worth watching. Christian is improving as a single competitor.

Great to see Mick Foley & The Rock back in the ring. Back and forth action. Flair and The Rock carry this match. Even at 54, Flair is better than most. Unexpected ending. <br /> <br />WWE Hall Of Fame Class Of 2004 10/10 <br />  Great memorable moment. To see the guys I grew up watching was touching. Greg Valentine, Tito Santana, Bobby Heenan, Big John Studd, Junkyard Dog and Jesse Ventura deserve this. <br /> <br />Stupid segment backstage with Jonathan Coachman, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young. <br /> <br />Playboy Evening Gown Match: <br />Raw vs Smackdown <br />Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie vs Torrie Wilson & Sable 0/10 <br />  What a waste of time!

Why does WWE rush the cruiserweights? <br /> <br />Smackdown vs Raw: <br />Brock Lesnar vs Goldberg(w/ Steve Austin as Referee) 5/10 <br />  What should have been a 9 rating was ruined by Lesnar's leaving followed by Goldberg.

A class act for him. <br /> <br />Fatal 4 Way: <br />WWE Tag Team Championship <br />Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs APA vs World's Greatest Tag Team vs Basham Brothers 6/10 <br />   An okay match. Could have been better. The last match for the Bashams for a while.  <br /> <br />Women's Championship: <br />Victoria vs Molly Holly( if Holly loses, must have head shaved) 5/10 <br />   Gets a 5 only because of the ending. Very boring match. Victoria should go back to psychotic act. <br /> <br />WWE Championship: <br />Eddie Guerrero vs Kurt Angle 9/10 <br /> Awesome match between 2 great ones. Angle's last match for a while. Back and forth action with a suprise ending. <br /> <br />Raw vs Smackdown: <br />Kane vs Undertaker 7/10 <br />  Hype was better than match itself. A return to the deadman for Taker. Entrance was awesome with Paul Bearer returning. Taker mixed deadman and biker moves together. Kane looked like a deer caught in the headlights. <br /> <br />Triple Threat Match <br />World Heavyweight Championship <br />Triple HHH vs Chris Benoit vs Shawn Michaels 10/10 <br />   A definite match of the year candidate. Intense action with lots of blood. Amazing that Triple HHH would be in a 10 match. He put on one of his best performances.  <br /> <br />  Overall, one of the 5 best Wrestlemanias ever with lots of historic significance.   <br />

I want to make fun of Japanese people and feature main characters that are so obnoxiously spoiled and self obsorbed, I could relate to them! DADDY!!!!! WAAAAAAHHH!!!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br /> <br />And I want an Oscar for screenwriting an improvised movie...  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Thank you, Daddy. (Did you make them an offer they couldn't refuse?)
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've just watched the movie. It's absolutely amazing. Yes, the music, decorations and screen effect are absolutely fabulous. But these things make a show. And this movie is deeper. The cast is a perfect fit. The Phantom and Christine are so natural and real that you start beleiving it was a true story. You have no doubt it could've happen. This is art in it's best form.
068987474X|2.0|This book is entertaining, but shouldn't be taken seriously. When a guy is ready, he's ready. When the relationship clicks, that will be it. Both sexes have to stop looking for excuses or rationalizations and get real. When it's right, and you're both smart and mature, you will both know it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West's CD is great. Each song has a great beat and is a trip for the ears.  Before this Kanye has been behind the scenes but now he is out now and showing the world he has it.  I know that his attitude can cause one to hate him from the start, but I would rather separate the man from his music.  I think Kanye is wonderful rapper and when he came on the scene this summer I knew he would be the next big thing.  The only problem I think may happen is his huge ego will knock him down.  Every rapper who starts off great loses the game because of their ego; and Kanye's is huge.  But, this boy has an usual rap sound and is great at mixing songs! I wasn't sure if he would be a one hit wonder but he already is filling up the airwaves with his songs and each song is unique in its own way.  I personally love this CD and hope he can tone down his ego to make another great CD.  My personal favorite song is \\"Workout Song\\".
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I cannot descibe how important this film is. If this masterpiece does not change your life, or make you want to change the world- well, you have lost yourself. <br />Maybe Joe Hisashi's greatest soundtrack ( which is saying alot). <br />Forget about Lord of the rings, or star wars, this film is the beginning of the Miyazaki universe. Laputa takes place \\"somewhere\\" in this world, as does Princess Mononoke. <br />The review before mine is much more detailed- all I can say is that This is in my top 3 favorite films of all time! Allow yourself the pleasure of experiencing this. my Teto!
B0002IU988|4.0|One Day Remains is an awesome Cd that eclipses Creed's past efforts in every single way (other than the slightly annoying vocal solos).  First, I'll break it down, song by song: <br /> <br />Find the Real: 10/10 Easily the best song on this album, it has a heavy and completey suprising background riff that is a departure from \\"Open Your Eyes.\\"  I put the cd in expecting more \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" and got this much better song.  It has my favorite solo on the album because of its range.  It isn't just really fast stuff like \\"OYE\\" it's better. <br /> <br />One Day Remains: 8/10 Catchy song, I like the noise at the beggining.  It's very fast, with a short and sweet solo to boot.  Not a bad song. <br /> <br />Open Your Eyes: 6/10 Ugh...I'm so sick of this song!  It's not that great, and not even close to being the best song on the album! <br /> <br />Burn It Down: 9/10 A tad long, but I love the solo at the end.  Also, I think the refrain is catchy for some reason. <br /> <br />Metalingus: 9/10 An interesting try at a metal song...I think it works!  It's a little different due to Mark's higher voice range, but it's not bad, could've used a solo, though (I love solos). <br /> <br />Broken Wings: 8/10 This song would be fairly boring if the chorus wasn't so catchy and the opening and ending weren't awesome acustic solos. <br /> <br />In Loving Memory: 4/10 The low point on the cd.  This song SUCKS!  It's boring and overly sappy for my taste.  That's all I have to say about that. <br /> <br />Down to My Last: 7/10 This song isn't bad, it's just a little sappy (less so than In Loving Memory) but redeems itself with the last true solo on the album. <br /> <br />Watch Your Words: 9/10 A catchy Metallica-ish song that is entertaining without being awesome, kinda like most rock bands.  Fairly standard, but I like the melody. <br /> <br />Shed My Skin: 8/10 I don't care for this song so I usually skip it.  It's not that it's bad, I just want to get to \\"The End is Here.\\" <br /> <br />The End is Here: 10/10 One of the best endings I've heard in a while.  It is dramatic, climactic, and just plain awesome, I especially like the egyptian-ish bridge, and they found a way to hold the last chord for 30 seconds.  Jeez, that's a long fade out! <br /> <br />This cd is less varied than Creed, but the guitar riffs and solos were not as interesting on Creed's three releases.  The only real problem I have with this awesome band is that I hate, HATE watching Mark sing!  But I don't plan on watching the video for \\"OYE\\" any time soon.  Overall, great buy, don't listen to the Windows Media Player Review (1.5 stars my butt)!
B000646MNE|5.0|I don't know about everyone else, but I don't know what my future would have been like if I had started watching this when it first came out.  I can totally relate to the characters back in my early 20's.  This is such a great series for anyone who has been in a few messy relationships during their lifetime.  I recommend this to everyone who has been with anyone!!!  Talk about a charming series with the sweetness and humility that everyone of us can relate to.  Highly recommend.
0786714875|5.0|We live in a political age where the currency of the politician is words, not actiion. Politicians \\"paint pictures\\" with words and the voters do not often hold them accountable. However, what was needed in Rwanda was, of course, action. There were no words that could stop the genocide.<br /><br />The Rwanda genocide is the an example of what happens when the world governments do not take the neccessary action. The author was there and he tells the entire story.
B000002UAO|5.0|The lyrics of Rubber soul represented a quantum leap in terms of thoughtfulness, maturity, and complex ambiguities. Musically, too, it was a substantial leap forward, with intricate folk-rock arrangements that reflected the increasing influence of Dylan and the Byrds. The group and George Martin were also beginning to expand the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group, using a sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),\\" Greek-like guitar lines on \\"Michelle\\" and \\"Girl,\\" fuzz bass on \\"Think for Yourself,\\" and a piano made to sound like a harpsichord on the instrumental break of \\"In My Life.\\" While John and Paul were beginning to carve separate songwriting identities at this point, the album is full of great tunes, from \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" and \\"Michelle\\" to \\"Girl,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" \\"You Won't See Me,\\" \\"Drive My Car,\\" and \\"Nowhere Man\\".
6304698526|3.0|In the last scene, Bullitt arives home, wearing his famous royal blue turtle-neck sweater. <br />He goes into the bathroom and looking back at him is his reflection wearing a dark maroon turtle-neck sweater! <br />and this movie won an award for editing!! <br />The chase scene in San Francisco is still a classic!!!
B000002WPI|5.0|the Wu-Tang Clan's debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), was one of the most influential rap albums of the '90s. it introduced a colorful cast of hugely talented MCs, some of whom ranked among the best and most unique individual rappers of the decade. Starting with a foundation of hard, gritty beats and dialogue samples from kung fu movies, RZA kept things minimalistic, but added just enough minor-key piano, strings, or muted horns to create a background ambience that works like the soundtrack to a surreal nightmare. There was nothing like it in the hip-hop world at the time, and even after years of imitation, Enter the Wu-Tang still sounds fresh and original. Subsequent group and solo projects would refine and deepen this template, but collectively, the Wu have never been quite this tight again
B0000067L2|5.0|Strange no one else has reviewed this. I love this album. Its one of the bluesiest almbums ever, but its also one of the heaviest, most driving records ever recorded as well. All the songs are pretty to really good, but in my opinion only Take it Back and the immortal Sunshine on Your Love are great. Blue Condition and Strange Brew are almost great. That's why I'd give it a 4.5 - the music is infinitely close to greatness, but just not close enough. But, because of it's legendary status and being possibly the first hard rock album, I'll give it the amazon.com 5
B0000025RI|5.0|This is where a song as gentle and lovely as \\"Human Nature\\" coexists comfortably with the tough, scared \\"Beat It,\\" the sweet schmaltz of the Paul McCartney duet \\"The Girl Is Mine,\\" and the frizzy funk of \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing).\\" And, although this is an undeniably fun record, the paranoia is already creeping in, manifesting itself in the record's two best songs: \\"Billie Jean,\\" where a woman claims Michael is the father of her child, and the delirious \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something,\\" the freshest funk on the album, but the most claustrophobic, scariest track Jackson ever recorded. These give the record its anchor, and are part of the reason why the record is more than just a phenomenon. The other reason, of course, is that much of this is just simply great music.
B0006213H6|5.0|This is my absolute favorite Sigur Ros album, even though it sounds nothing like what they sound like today. For the most part, it is ambient soundscapes with dark noises bubbling to the surface. Also, the vocals are so far back in the mix, you can't tell what he's saying and they sound like another instrument. Yes, people have been saying that about Agaetis Byrjum, but on Von, they're pushed even further. <br /> <br />To be honest, there are about 5 actual songs on here. The rest are soundscapes and weird noises. The 1st track alone is 10 minutes of minimal electronica. The only song here that reminded me of the later stuff is the title track. Very beatiful, slow, and full of things that will make your heart melt. <br /> <br />Fans of () and Agaetis Bryjum probably aren't going to like this. But if you dig amibient electronic music, you'll like this. For fans of Aphex Twin and My Bloody Valentine.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Mostly recorded without Brian Jones who died several months before its release and was replaced by Mick Taylor this extends the rock and blues feel of Beggars Banquet into slightly harder-rocking, more demonically sexual territory. The Stones were never as consistent on album as their main rivals, the Beatles, and Let It Bleed suffers from some rather perfunctory tracks, like \\"Monkey Man\\" and a countrified remake of the classic \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\". Yet some of the songs are among their very best, especially \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" with its shimmering guitar lines and apocalyptic lyrics; the harmonica-driven \\"Midnight Rambler\\"; the druggy party ambience of the title track; and the stunning \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" which was the Stones' \\"Hey Jude\\" of sorts, with its epic structure, horns, philosophical lyrics, and swelling choral vocals. \\"You Got the Silver\\" and Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain,\\" by contrast, were as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as the Stones ever got
B000001Y16|5.0|This is def Tupacz greatest album...fav song on da Track wud hav 2 b Hali Mary. R.I.P man...u died but ur music will alwayz live on... <br /> <br />- PE@CE
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile on Main St. has become generally regarded as the Rolling Stones' finest album. the songs, including the masterpieces \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" \\"Happy,\\" \\"Let It Loose,\\" and \\"Shine a Light,\\" are all terrific, they blend together, with only certain lyrics and guitar lines emerging from the murk. It's the kind of record that's gripping on the very first listen, but each subsequent listen reveals something new. Few other albums, let alone double albums, have been so rich and masterful as Exile on Main St, and it sets a remarkably high standard for all of hard rock.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Gerard Butler has put his heart and soul into this character not to mention his acting and singing talents. Every movement, every flick of his eyes, every breath he draws makes the Phantom more alive than all the other characters combined. Emmy and Patrick are marvelous as Christine and Raoul but the Phantom is the heart of the drama. A classic in every way -- music, costumes, set, storytelling, and direction -- don't miss this stellar work in the movie houses or on this DVD.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Opening with the epic \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" Highway 61 Revisited careens through nine songs that range from reflective folk-rock (\\"Desolation Row\\") and blues (\\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\") to flat-out garage rock (\\"Tombstone Blues,\\" \\"From a Buick 6,\\" \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\"). Dylan had not only changed his sound, but his persona, trading the folk troubadour for a streetwise, cynical hipster. Throughout the album, he embraces druggy, surreal imagery, which can either have a sense of menace or beauty, and the music reflects that, jumping between soothing melodies to hard, bluesy rock. And that is the most revolutionary thing about Highway 61 Revisited, it proved that rock & roll needn't be collegiate and tame in order to be literate, poetic, and complex.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|This is just too strange. I give Metallica credit for allowing filmmaker Bruce Sinovsky unlimited access to the two year anger, alcohol and therapy fueled soap opera that resulted in their St. Anger album. This one really shows the warts. Founders Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield frankly come across as two pampered, egotistical and selfish superstars trying desperately to keep the gravy train rolling despite their hatred for each other while guitarist Kirk Hammett and producer Bob Rock spend most of the film rolling their eyes at the childish antics of the two leaders. Aside from some studio snippets there's not much music here but lots of therapy sessions with a sports shrink the band's managers hired to keep them from each other's throats long enough to get an album in the can. Not very exciting unless you're a psychotherapy fan. You'll find more of interest on the bonus CD which has a memorable bit performed by Kirk for his driving school class, a good live version of 'Frantic' and an interesting tailgate show for Raiders fans who are a whole lot scarier than headbangers. That's when it hits you that somehow these dysfuntional spoiled rockstars somehow mangaged to come out of this with St. Anger, a great album. Beats me how...
B00007FOMP|5.0|What's Going On catapulted Marvin Gaye into superstardom. Three number one singles were pulled from the album: the title song, \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),\\" and \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler).\\" This was the first album where Marvin overdubbed his voice multiple times, creating a one-man vocal group. The result was a level of timbral integration in the harmonies that became a Gaye trademark.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Please buy this album!!! Sure you may have heard it all before but probably only in small measures. MCR use tried and tested formulas to create a rather OTT audio-movie going experience which is no bad thing. It is an eclectic mix of everything you can think of.     The lyrics are very thought-provoking and most likely bordering on disturbing, who cares if Gerard mainly sings about drugs and violence?! I certainly don't. Crank it up whilst burning rubber on motorways or on your cd player I don't care this just needs to make its way into your cd collection
0440237688|3.0|I personally like to read stories with more realistic qualities than the Giver, by Lois Lowery had to offer. However, if you were looking for some real fiction, this would be a good choice. This story is a very easy read about a boy growing up in a community of all `sameness' where members of the community have everything laid out for them such as their spouses, their children and their careers. Jonas, the main character, is given a big role in the community that is supposed to be an honor that only pushes Jonas away from his friends, family and community. Also, along with finding the story extremely unrealistic, I found it was still sad and almost depressing. Not a bad story for an open mind or a young child.
0452284392|3.0|I read \\"Linked\\" after reading \\"The Tipping Point\\", hoping to find a somewhat more detailed exposition of networks. \\"Linked\\" provides this. Unfortunately, there just isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />The main (and only) point that Barabasi makes is that most networks (particularly the ones he considers) are so-called scale-free networks, as opposed to random networks, and he gives plenty of real world examples to back this up. While this is a significant and intriguing point, it perhaps does not merit an entire book. The obstacle that \\"Linked\\" never overcomes is that its substance is purely observational: We learn \\"How everything is connected to everything else\\" but not why it is so or \\"what it means\\". This is particularly true later on in the book, in Barabasi's discussions of terror networks, corporate boards, and biochemistry.<br /><br />\\"Linked\\" starts out fascinatingly and finishes boringly. Too bad.
B00000ING2|3.0|Positives: <br /> <br />1)  It is original, different, and fun.  If you are tired of the same ol' movie that Hollywood basically stamps from a mold then you might enjoy the different pace of this movie. <br />2)  Humor.  Some of the humor is over the top and some of the parts where they were reaching for a laugh will actually have you looking at your neighbor and sighing.  However, if you stick with it, there are a few parts that are actually worth laughing at.  But be prepared, it is a different type of humor that I can imagine many won't understand. <br />3)  Family Friendly (almost).  For the most part, the women are dressed modestly and there is no cussing.  However, there are some thematic elements (i.e., suicide and corporate scandals) that you might want to be ready to explain to the kids.  Not recommended for really young children. <br /> <br />Negatives <br />1)  Plot.  Well, the plot of the good-natured person that somebody raises to the top to walk all over them has been done and redone so many times that this just becomes a Hollywood cliche.  However, the plot is also fairly unrealistic. <br />2)  Easy Way Out.  Okay, it seems that whenever our \\"hero\\" is in a bind, something pops up unexpectedly that ends up saving the day.  That aspect actually lacks of creativity... which is something we have come to expect from the Coen brothers.  Wait until you see how our Barnes survives slipping on the ledge of a 44/45 story building. <br />3)  Boring.  Though the people are pretty fast talkers, the pace of the movie is actually pretty slow... as if the creators were trying to find out how to stretch it out into a full-length movie. <br />4)  Acting.  Oh, the acting is atrocious.  Don't be looking for any academy award acting here (I never looked, but I highly suspect nobody was nominated here).  The acting is waaaaay over the top and distracts from the story being told. <br /> <br />So, you may love it and you may hate it.  I hope I've helped you figure out whichgroup you belong in.  Not recommended to watching in groups as this will not please everybody.
B000002UAX|5.0|There exist those precious few albums that literally define \\"classic\\" and automatically come to mind when considering the greatest ever made. An argument can be made that everything the Fab Four touched is classic, but their self-titled double-LP effort out of 1968 surpasses pretty much all their other works and still ranks high on every \\"greatest album\\" list. Revolver revealed a more mature thematic approach and Sgt. Pepper certainly broke new ground in terms of production and songwriting, but the White Album displays the great individual talents of the band like nothing else in their catalog. The musical variety is so diverse and wide-reaching that it could almost be seen as a history of 20th century msuic summed up in 90 minutes (well, the good music anyway). Judging by its monumental sales (over 18 million and counting) just about everyone has owned The White Album at some point. Give it a listen and it's not hard to see why. It's practially flawless.
B000002534|4.0|This album is way ahead of its time musically. <br />If you resonate with the spritual aspect, it's a 5.
B0002KP5FI|5.0|WoW! I have listened to Nicola Conte's talent for over 2 years now, and his first albums get a high workout in my collection of over 500 CDs. This new CD had me worried there for a minute because I thought that Nicola has escaped into some new weird musical underground with this retro-sounding album, but upon intent listening I am not worried any more! The album has some stand-out tracks but my favorite is the title track (number 11). Words fail me in describing the beautiful sound of this and his other records. I am a dedicated fan for life! Five stars from me!
0316172324|4.0|In the small arena of unconscious thought, Gladwell explores two main areas that on first glance contradict each other. First he argues that our instinctual impressions can be trained to give us insight beyond what our intellect allows. Next he points out that those same instinctual impressions can easily lead us astray and exacerbate our prejudices and emotional biases. So which is it? <br /> <br />Both--although the balance between the two approaches is mostly ignored. Gladwell lays out the principles of _Blink_ on pages 14-15: Snap judgments can be as good as deliberate decisions; you can learn when to listen to them and when to ignore them; and you can educate and control them for when you do listen. The first and third of the principles are explored in great depth, but the second doesn't get any attention. That's a shame, because all his examples hint at the possibility of codifying which decisions should be \\"blinked\\" and which should be thought out traditionally. <br /> <br />The one main conclusion Gladwell draws is that if you do \\"blink\\" a decision, you'd better have experience. The stories consistently show that if you have practice making snap judgments, you make them better. You can learn traits of a field to improve just in that area (reading facial expressions is one such example), but nothing substitutes for experience. So build your own or hire someone who has it, and then you can \\"blink\\" well, your products can \\"blink\\" well, and you'll know to keep your eyes open when you're not \\"blinking\\".
B00005ASOI|2.0|Sometimes the public is right and the critics are wrong. Sometimes the critics are right and the public is wrong. Sometimes they're both right but in the case of \\"Suspiria\\" they're both wrong. This is the most over-rated horror movie ever. Only the first and last 12 minutes of this movie are worth seeing. Everything in the middle is just bland. A few inane death scenes here, some over the top music there and lots of senseless chatter. The story should've explored witchcraft more thoroughly and made more use of it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen this movie a total of three times, the most I have ever done for a moive while in theathers. It is definately worth it.<br /><br />Emmy, Gerard, and Patrick are amazing as the leads, they give passion and emotion to the timeless story, which i feel the stage version was lacking. Sarah Brighton is amazing, but is all wrong for Christine. Emmy brings the emotion and innocence to Christine, portraying her love for Raoul and desire for the Phantom. Gerard is a more rogue-ish Phantom, and gives the Phantom a backbone that Micheal Crawford lacked. He brings a sexual desire to the Phantom, which is what is intended in the ALW version and Susan Kay's \\"Phantom.\\"<br /><br />This movie is defiantely a feast for the eyes and was completely robbed for the Oscars. The acting is wonderful and the cast is extremely talented! Just listening to the soundtrack gives me chills and I can't wait to enjoy the movie again.<br /><br />Plus, the only reason it is being released so early, is that is was a limited release, showing that Hollywood did not expect it to be as successful and beloved as it truly was. (Can anyone say \\"Moulin Rouge?\\")<br /><br />SEE IT IF YOU HAVEN'T!!!!!
B00004CWO8|5.0|If the usual ballet corps in productions of 'Swan Lake' are about the poise and gracefulness of a swan's movement, then this version is certainly about the virility, strength, and - to be honest - obnoxiousness of wild birds (this is coming straight from someone who's been attacked by ducks while throwing crumbs!).  I am in full agreement with Matthew Bourne when he says that swans can be a very masculine and aggressive animal.  This corps portrayed it quite well, especially toward the last two scenes. <br /> <br />Adam Cooper makes a magnificient Swan and a dangerous, sexy Stranger.  The ball scene reeks of virtuousity and should have been a debilating dance.  Instead, he smokes at multiple points while the scene is still going on!  Quite impressive.   <br /> <br />While watching the Prince, I felt a dreadful sense of loneliness, explaining his wretched behavior.  Unloved by his mother, forcing an unexpected and emotionally-laden pas de deux, used by his courtiers and abused by a tramp...poor man, small wonder he would be enchanted with visions of a Swan!   <br /> <br />If you get hung up on the fact that two men are dancing the pas de deux, you're missing the point.  It's not unreasonable to assume that the Prince is gay, and you'd be hard pressed to miss how affectionate the Prince/Swan interactions are, or even the brutal sexuality of the Prince/Stranger scenes.  But the ballet is more, much more, about the power of 'touch', and how big a role affection can, and should, play in one's life.  For my money, that's far more entertaining - and accessible - than the concept of princesses under enchantment. <br /> <br />I recommend this version to anyone - especially those who are burning out on the traditional Swan Lake.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|If you haven't been keeping up on current world issues or have lived under a rock for the last 10 years, this movie is not for you. If you thought of bringing your kids along, because it has puppets, don't. If you have an open mind, and are not offended by crude humor, puppet sexuality and violence, and severe stereotypes, this movie is brilliant.<br /><br />If you are a fan of South Park you will feel right at home. This movie delivers the same one liners you come to expect in an episode of South Park. The movie pulls no punches and takes jabs at celebrities big and small.<br /><br />The music deserves its own review. The music in this movie made me laugh harder than I ever have before in my life. Seriously. The Team America theme song is pure genius.<br /><br />If you are sensitive about the current situation with terrorism and the way we tend to handle it with our current situation, this movie may not be up your alley. If you can see the humor in all of it and feel like a good laugh, run, swim, fly, do whatever possible to go see this movie.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Sorry, I try to be open minded, but the noise that Slipknot creates cannot be called music. And what's with the stupid masks? Let me guess, their mommies didn't love them enough? It's sad to think how dispossesed and disfunctional someone would have to be to buy into the (...) that is Slipknot. Let's hope that these no talent posers crawl back into their holes before they can unleash Vol 4...
B0006A9FMI|3.0|The movie was OK as far as it went. Definitely a great deal of effort went into it, and probably works better on the big screen. I found the intermixing of the traditional and CG animation very distracting, unlike the original which was nearly all traditional animation (save some mechanics and computer display imagery done in CG.) A traditional animated person holding a CG animated gun - what's the point in that? You get a little lost following the plotline towards the end, and the whole what-does-it-mean-to-be-human message doesn't have the impact you'd hope for. AND an English dub would've been appreciated.    *SPOILER ALERT!!*    Also, don't you hate it when a film version of a comic takes a snippet of one of the original comic's stories, uses it in the film, but less effectively? The girl rescuing herself from the factory by sabotaging the dolls and hoping someone would investigate is straight from the comic, but doesn't drive home Masamune Shirow's point of personal responsibility (you shouldn't try to save your own neck at the expense of innocents.)

B000002KIE|5.0|This baby started the whole punk sensation! Forget today's artists that say they're punk but they're most definitely not! Sex Pistols are the greatest and original. Next to The Ramones and The Clash, Sex Pistols are the best punk artists. This album is full of real punk and no pop. Buy it now. I'd buy it for Anarchy In The UK and God Save The Queen alone. But there are much more awesome songs.
0393317552|5.0|I listened to the audiobook version in my car and I enjoyed it so much that I often found myself sitting in the parking lot of my destination listening for ten more minutes. <br /> <br />Diamond has a way of analyzing history that is both thorough and ingenious.  Normally I absoluetely hate history lessons, but this book is in a league of its own.  It has sparked my interest in all of the topics that Diamond covered and has left me thinking about them every day.  I am going to listen to this one again, probably buy the book, and then listen to the sequel, \\"Collapse.\\" <br /> <br />All those critics giving it bad reviews are used to the typical boring history lessons that are so detailed your head will spin--if you don't fall asleep. <br /> <br />If you are even mildly interested in exercising your brain cells, get this book.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This is a beautiful homage to the serial flims of the 1930's.  It is astounding what can be done with CG these days.  I loved the invading robots at the biginning of this highly imaginative film, but my compliments end there.  Though the CG work is top notch and most impressive the story and acting is dull.  Gweneth Paltrow is particularly annoying as a meddlesome reporter.  Jolie is not in the film as much as you might guess from previews.<br /><br />Hovercract aircarriers, giant robots, a mad scientist building a space arc?  How could this possibly have gone wrong.  Prepared to be astounded by the visuals and then bored by the story.<br /><br />Nothing offensive in this movie, but not really worth watching.
B0000029GA|5.0|...was giving this baby a 5 Mic rating. A certified classic in every respect, Illmatic definitely deserved higher sales than it got in 1994. Yet it ain't too surprising, though. After all, it was Ready To Die that got all the hype because of its mainstream appeal. And let's face it; I got much love for Biggie, but he was most popular with his pop-oriented songs, even if they were undeniably good. Nevertheless, \\"Illmatic\\" will remain a manual for purist hip-hop advocates and \\"intelligent gangstas\\" the world over. Only true problem is that it's 9 songs long, with the exception of \\"The Genesis\\" which boils down to a skit.<br /><br />I'm going to have mercy on you and not give any lengthy pros/cons comparisons. It'd be pointless anyway; it's perfect score, right? Nasir Jones, the hungry youth from the notorious QB projects serves up an unrelenting batch of slick, eloquent, and deadly wordplay on the mic, as he breaks it down (for instance) on \\"Ain't Hard To Tell\\". The beats are knocking as well, with DJ Premier (\\"NY State Of Mind\\" is arguably his best work; \\"Represent\\" is second), Q-Tip (his minimal soundscapes blends well with Nas' vivid storytelling on \\"One Love\\"), and Pete Rock (I admit I wasn't feeling \\"The World Is Yours\\" that much, but still good) behind the boards. As for guests, there are none to bog down the album or steal the shine...but two. On the steller \\"Life A B---h\\", the hook and 1st verse are provided by AZ, another fantastic Queens MC who matches Nas' mic skills (at least on this song) bar none. the other guest is Nas' pops, trumpeteer Olu Dara, who adds his horn to the end of the track. Like father, like son, eh? The only bad things I can say about this otherwise flawless album is that it's only 10 tracks, so quick fixes are outta the question because when Nas starts spittin', he'll suck you in. Also, the beats are great, but if you weren't listening to rap in 1994, odds are that the arsenal of East Coast producers won't faze your interest; it can still sound old. Then again, I didn't get interested in rap until 2003 (pathetic, ain't it), and it's the lyricism that makes this thing untouchable.<br /><br />There will never be another Illmatic. Period. And even with Nas murdering MCs (LYRICALLY folks; grow up) to this date, I doubt even he can make another Illmatic. But if this disc is too dated for you young'ns, then try \\"The Lost Tapes\\", which is almost as good, with slicker beats. Otherwise, if you're serious about hip-hop, take a listen to the guy who (with Biggie and Wu-Tang) brought the East Coast back.<br /><br />P.S.: I said I wouldn't be long, but oh well...old.

B00005JN4H|4.0|But then, I've got a bit of a \\"thing\\" for Jimmy Fallon, so perhaps my opinion is colored by my affinity for him..! <br /> <br />I did think this movie was very, very funny. There were some very surprising twists, and some scenes that were so ridiculously funny, they carried the movie. <br /> <br />The EXTENDED play version was a little boring, however... I normally love the \\"director's cut\\" versions of movies, as I'd rather see more - but in this case it created too much time between the really funny parts. <br /> <br />I really thought Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon were hysterically funny. My kids saw this 4 times in the theatre. I saw it once, then got the DVD as soon as it was available. I do recommend the shorter version if you have the option.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have been putting this one off and I don't know why. I saw the Broadway production back in 2001 and I really enjoyed it. I guess due to the harsh critic reviews and the fact that I thought that most actors couldn't sing these wonderful songs kept me away until today. Let me just say that the critics are way off and I would easily put this film in the top 5 I have seen last year. The first thing that stands out in this film besides the beauty of Emmy Rossum as Christine is the lavish production & set design. There is so much detail and color everywhere that you will have to watch this film again to take it all in. The two leads are great in the acting and singing department, especially Rossum (an angel's voice to go with that beautiful face) who is the standout of the group. Gerard Butler really surprised me here and made a very complex Phantom. And I must mention Minnie Driver who was very funny as Carlotta, but didn't use her real voice. Ignore the critics and look at the 5 star rating here from people like you and me. This is the best movie musical ever in my opinion and should be seen on the big screen for the sheer spectacle of it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|There are few movies that I ponder long after I see them and this is one of them.  The music stayed in my mind for days and now I have the CD so I can listen anytime I like.  <br />I was awed with the beauty of the sets, the attention to detail in the costumes which were elegant, and the emotion and passion from the actors drew me into their world for the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes.  I didn't want it to end. In fact, I have had to see it 4 more times. It seems to engage me at the level of my own desire to love and be loved.  We, at some time in our lives, may experience rejection, hurt and betrayal and maybe even feel a little inferior to others.  All this worked to draw me into the story of these characters even at my grandmotherly age! <br /> In fact, the matinees that I attend seem to be evenly divided between the young high school students who are being introduced to something like opera since there are 3 parts of \\"operas\\" as part of the movie, and retired folks like me. <br />When the movie ends, there is complete silence for awhile. Most of us seem totally entranced by what we just saw.  <br />I have not seen the stage play and knew little about what to expect before seing this movie.  I was blown away. Try to see it on the big screen.  I know that I will have this movie in my collection!
6304007523|4.0|OK so what bothered me about this movie was the final end fight where Rocky meets the Soviet heavyweight champion. While the movie is capturing because it's unpretentious and \\"real\\", that very end fight is just unbelievably unrealistic. Little rocky takes about 200 hard punches to his face and head, and first off, he doesn't even keep his guard up protect himself but instead his face is constantly left unprotected. He keeps his fists dingling down instead of keeping them up, like every boxer does, and so he gets tossed around by the Russian like a rug, which is very very unrealistic because nobody can take even 1/3 of that many punches to his face without getting knocked out. Basically it's frustrating to see Rocky putting down as much time and energy on training as he does, because it makes you expect him to stand his ground against the Russian. The Russian is training with hightech equipment while Rocky uses whatever the \\"outdoors\\" provide him with in terms of physical challenges like running uphill, slogging through deep snow etc, and the implication seems to be that Rocky's more primitive training methods will prove more effective in the end than the Russian's. Indeed it's a quiet frustrating feeling when Rocky finally meets the opponent in the ring, where he appears totally inferior and that makes you feel sorry for Rocky.  Basically, I think, they didn't need to humiliate Rocky that much. The fight could've been and should've been made more equal. This is simply because as sta nds now, the game is completely unequal; Rocky takes blow after blow to his face, round after round, while not only failing to hold his guard, but he doesn't even fight back, and when attempting to do so it looks pretty lame. You think that \\"c'mmon Rocky what was all that training good for!\\", and you expect him to be much better than he is. And moreover he keeps tolerating all those punches to his head and face, and we're talking about, say 100 punches, not trying to exaggerate, perhapseven up to 200 punches considering all punches that are not \\"shown\\", probably incrementing that number to 200-250 punches.   Towards the end of that fight, and at the end of the film, Rocky is still not knocked out which is very unrealistic. But once he hits the Russian just once, the Russian is almost knocked out which makes you wonder. Have you seen that other flick \\"No retreat no surrender\\"? If you know the final battle in that film then you also know that that was a much more well balanced and less humiliating fight. Which is to say that this version of \\"heroic\\" (the heroism aspect is a bit hyped) championship game is a bit over the top. Things would be way better if they could keep things as realistic as possible without sacrificing the excitement of a movie. In this film they don't. Rocky is a very bad boxer compared to his opponent, yet he wins, when he should in fact already be on his way to the hospital. Too bad, still this is a well done movie in other areas.
B00013F35I|1.0|I have all of Springsteen's DVD's and some \\"bootleg\\" video as well.  I have like 50 concerts of various artists on video.  I love Springsteen.  But, I had to sell this back.  Maybe there was a bad run, but the sound quality on my DVD was so bad, it sounded like it was recorded in a closet.  It had none of the energy of the NY concert.  I was really disappointed because I loved the idea of getting a complete concert.  My ears work fine.  My DVD did not. <br />Anybody got an explanation for this. <br />
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|I guess I know how John Clark feels, which is why I found this movie so utterly wonderful.  I watch it over and over.  The feeling of stolen pleasure that comes from slipping out to do something you know others might disapprove of.  The feeling of pure joy and heart's delight at allowing yourself to fully express the joy that is within you, but you never get to let it out. The fun of allowing your body to express what you think and feel inside.  Celebrating the gift of life.  That's what Shall We Dance is about.  Being in my 40's, I have become committed to living my life with as much joy as I can muster, and finding ways to let it be expressed.  The sadness of Paulina, the sweetness of John, the exuberant nature of Link as he dances, finally free to express who he is, I can identify with all of these emotions, which is why I love this movie.
1591840562|5.0|I read both this and \\"A Good Hard Kick in the Ass\\"  and I must say this one was more entertaining and insightful.  His technology focus is not so obvious and there were some very memorable moments.  The one thing that both books drive home is... Get to market now!
6300216268|5.0|The Cat Stevens soundtrack is incredible. The farcical Bud Cort is fabulous. If you love and miss your grandmother, and you have a little Goth in you, you'll love this movie. :)
0385510454|3.0|Once you get past the middle of this novel, it becomes what you'ld expect of Grisham--first, however, you have to wade (scan?)through LOTS of  tourist trivia about the cities and streets which he has obviously traveled through on vacation.  Eventually, it is a good mystery.  An unexpected ending!
B0000025OP|4.0|OK, let's get serious.  Another reviewer slams this album because he doesn't like the Band.  And he doesn't like the Band, first, because he thinks Robbie Robertson is a \\"smug, condescending, pretentious rock star.\\"  For a moment, let's grant that.  Robertson has certainly had his moments.  But if we're going to start trashing albums because of smug, pretentious rock stars there's going to be an awful lot of discs in the bonfire including quite a few by Bobby Zimmerman himself and a bunch by John Lennon.  Seems to me smug and pretentious is an occupational hazard in a world afloat in dope and sycophancy. But are we reviewing the music or the person?   The second reason this reviewer dislikes the Band is because they're \\"loud\\" and nothing else.  This interests me.  My grandfather told me there were people way back a long time ago who got upset when Dylan plugged in his guitar and started touring with the Band, but I didn't realize there were any of them still around.  To my ear, the Band's experimentation with color and timbre is interesting, as is their attempt to graft white roots music, rock and roll, cajun and other sounds.  Criticize them for a lot of things, but for loudness?  I guess this would me we can't like the Stones either. I distinctly remember the instructions on (I think) \\"Exile on Main Street\\" --- \\"Play this album LOUD.\\"  Then the reviewer doesn't like the Band because Levon Helm had stage fright (see my comments on ad hominem criticism above --- also check out Sir Laurence Olivier's autobiography in which he describes his agonizing struggles with a similar problem). Finally, the reviewer says he doesn't like the album because of Dylan's songwriting and Robertson's scratchy guitar..  Here at last we have a discussion of the music and its presentation.  Good for him for expressing his opinion.  I simply disagree with him.  To me, experimentation is not apostasy, and I like the way this album sounds. And, like the Duke said, \\"If it sounds good, it is good.\\" <br /> <br />I invite people to listen for themselves and make up their own minds. <br /> <br />
B00006JLX4|4.0|Here's the problem.  The remastering of the original Pavement Slanted & Enchanted album, IMHO the best noise-pop album ever, ruins almost all the original album tracks.  Whoever remastered the album put TOO MUCH emphasis on the bass/mid-bass.  The consequence?  Classic tracks like Summer Babe, Trigger Cut, Here, Zurich Is Stained, Loretta's Scars, end up sounding very muddied.  Remember, there was no bass guitar recorded for most of the original album tracks; so why did the studio engineer emphasize the bass portion so much in this remaster?.  Not surprisingly, the only track that actually sounds better in this remaster is In the Mouth a Desert, no doubt due to the song's driving bass line. <br /> <br />The wealth of additional content on this double disc edition is absolutely essential.  And fortunately, they don't suffer from the same remastering issues as the the S&E tracks.  The inclusion of the live concert shows Pavement at their frenetic, energetic best. <br /> <br />The bottom line: <br /> <br />If you are a Pavement fan and already own the original S&E CD, BUY this album, but KEEP your original S&E CD.  Trust me. <br /> <br />If you are relatively new to Pavement, buy the ORIGINAL S&E CD first, then purchase the remaster for the bonus material later. <br /> <br />Cheers. <br />
B000006OAM|5.0|Natalie Merchant is one of the most amazing songwriters still making records today.  She's always original (unlike Tori Amos) and her voice is just stunning.  Ophelia isn't the kind of album everyone will appreciate, but it's hard to not be able to find anything good about the album.  Merchant's voice has never sounded so beautiful and the music and lyrics compliment each other perfectly.  If you have a slight interest in Natalie, I'd pick up Tigerlily before getting Ophelia or Motherland.  If you end up a fan of Natalie's, do yourself a favour a buy Ophelia!
B0002YLC24|5.0|Every once in a while, a film comes along which enriches my experience on this earth as a human being.  I know, it may seem like hyperbole to give a film such credit. But after watching this movie, I felt the walls of my consciousness expand.  And the ending left me in a state of joy that is becoming more and more difficult to achieve these days. So I am thankful that I saw this film, and so thankful that Linklater, Delpy and Hawke made it and gave it such a uniquely personal light.  But it is not for everyone. Some may find a film which is basically two people talking for 80 minutes limited, boring.  In fact judging by box office receipts, most people won't like it.  But for those of us who cherish language, communication between two people; who have that desire to experience great emotion and longing, but are hesitant and influenced by a society which corners us into small safe decisions; for us, this movie is a revelation. A great companion piece to My Dinner with Andre.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Being one of those people who up to this point has no clue as to why everyone considers Tarantino a filmatic genius, I didn't have much hope for KB1. I still don't get the Tarantino mystique (VERY weird guy by any stretch of the word, and he can't act), but I admit I liked this film and have watched it several times. Of course the action and 'blood' are overwrought, but that's the point. He had very effective use of color versus black-and-white, action versus slow-motion, but the anime about O-Ren's early life went on far too long. And - Vernita's daughter was far too old for the plot: given the timeline, she should have been no more than 3 years old, and that kid certainly wasn't. Nevertheless, I found myself anxiously awaiting the debut of KB2 on the movie channel; however, I was disappointed for the most part in that film as well, for different reasons: the slow pace, the extended alndscape and bar scenes, the failure to 'explain' things I wanted to know, like where did 'The Bride' come from, how did she get hooked up with Bill, why was she the enemy of the other DIVAs (besides her defection from the clan)? But - there was that delicious performance by Daryl Hannah, and the great fight scene between her and Uma Thurman - that pretty much made the movie! I hovered between 3 and 4 stars because of the inconsistences and gaps, but what tilted the stars to a 4 were Uma Thurman's chameleon, gutsy performance, and, of course, Elle Driver.
B00008NRI8|3.0|There's not an ounce of surprise in Two Weeks Notice, and I don't understand how the Amazon reviewer could say otherwise.  Two gorgeous people completely ill-suited for each other find love while the rich...(here Amazon has inexplicably censored something I said factually about the plot, in what is perhaps an oversensitive bit of compassion for the pitiful plight of the unimaginably wealthy)...--Hugh Grant in a brilliant bit of casting, who would EVER have thought he could have played this part--gets a lesson in morals from clumsy/feisty/uptight Sandra Bullock--how COULD anyone have ever thought SHE'D play against type like this, having done so much Shakespeare?--while Bullock's frost gets thawed by Grant.  If you didn't know by the tenth minute into the film this was coming, you need to check your pulse, you may already be brain dead.  Even so, it's not a bad movie, and Bullock and Grant have their charm.  But as far as I'm concerned, that charm is the only reason to see the film, which is nothing more or less than serviceable.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Audioslave, my friends, is not cookie-cutter garbage like Creed or Nickleback.  It's actually, well, unique....and even better, gritty.  While no masterpiece, this is, nonetheless, a solid album worth checking out for anyone who digged Rage, Soundgarden, or Chris Cornell's solo work.  My fav tracks include Cochise, Show Me How to Live, What You Are, Like a Stone, Shadow of the Sun, and Bring Em Back Alive(Tom Morello's guitar work is sick on this one) to name a few.<br /><br />The first part of the CD is no doubt more solid than the slower, more introspective latter half.  In a recent interview, Cornell stated that the band was feeling their roots with this album, and that the new album they're working on in the studio now will be much more cohesive and not like two separate superbands doing their own thing in each song.  Anyways, this one is an undeniably uncompromising and intense first effort that rocks.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This cd is badass. And who are these kids that are rating a 1 star review?? Like Pete \\"Snake\\" for example: he rates this with one star, yet he gives AC/DC's back in black 5 stars. I guess he did this because AC/DC has such an awesome drummer who is always wailing on the double bass and changing up the rythm. Or even worse the reviewer Bernard Thomas with writing his reviews while drinking hipnotic and hennesey, he writes (and I quote) \\"Ripping off death metal from sweden and thrash metal from the 80s , add in gay emo voices and you get this band.\\" He also rated a disney channel's kids bop cd with 5 stars! WTF is that?
B00001ZWTT|3.0|Judging by the tone of some of these pompous reviews, one would think this flick was being offered as the latest adaptation of one of Bill Shakespeare's works. Geez, c'mon people. It's just what it appeared to be: A bit of summer fluff with buddies, sight-gags, wisecracks and a little cleavage. It wasn't meant to be \\"true\\" to the original series. I used to watch WWW religiously as a kid during the Spy Craze of the '60's but, really, would it translate well to today's jaded audiences? Boooorring. No, it was made to appeal to a wide demographic with just enough of the original stuff to tweak the memories of us older geezers and a hip quality thrown in to hook the younger folks. The jokes could have been a little more clever but Smith and Klein delivered adequate performances and Kenneth Branagh's over-the-top interpretation of Loveless was a scream and helped carry the weight. I can't believe people are actually picking apart the possibility of such technology as the Tarantula existing in the late nineteenth century or whether a black man would have the carte blanche that Smith's Jim West had during that time. It was an action-fantasy-comedy for chissake! Helloooo?! Anyway, I found it somewhat disappointing the first time I saw it but I've watched it a couple of times since then and it kind of grows on you. Not a movie I could watch over and over again like Star Wars or The Matrix but the DVD doesn't sink to coffeetable coaster status either. I'd call it moderately amusing and if you're a Smith, Klein or Branagh fan, definitely worth adding to your collection despite what the Rex reed wannabes say.
0893860220|5.0|Even as I was reading this book, I was wondering how I would ever describe it in a review. Now that I've finished the book, I realize there is no true way to describe it. The book, a compilation of tape recorded interviews between Sri Nisargadatta and questioners/seekers from around the globe, contains the simple admonition to dwell on the \\"I am\\" of your existence- to be so aborbed in the reality of the present moment, that both past and future dissolve into blissful awareness of the now.  Again and again, questioners challange him about the suffering in the world and the cause of pain and the need to \\"do\\" something.  His assertion is that there can be no effective \\"doing\\" without first knowing who you are- that your true self is not a body or a brain, but much more.  Here are just a few of the profound statements he shares...    \\"The window is the absence of the wall and it gives air and light because it is empty. Be empty of all mental content, of all imagination and effort, and the very absence of obstacles will cause reality to rush in.\\" (page 260)    \\"You are free once you understand that your bondage is of your own making and you cease forging the chains that bind you.\\" (page 304)    \\"Very few are those who have the courage to trust the innocent and the simple. To know that your are a prisoner of your mind, that you live in an imaginary world of your own creation is the dawn of wisdom.\\"    \\"Once you realize that the road is the goal and that you are always on the road, not to reach a goal, but to enjoy its beauty and its wisdom, life ceases to be a task and becomes natural and simple, in itself an ecstacy.\\" (page 426)    (When asked \\"What is the realization which is beyond understanding?\\" this was his reply)    \\"Imagine a dense forest full of tigers and you are in a strong steel cage. Knowing that you are well protected by the cage, you watch the tigers, fearlessly. Next you find the tigers in the cage and yourself roaming about in the jungle. Last- the cage disappears and you ride the tigers!\\" (page 477)    \\"We seek the real because we are unhappy with the unreal. Happiness is our real natue and we shall never rest until we find it.\\" (page 486)    \\"In the end you know that there is no sin, no guilt, no retribution, only life in its endless transformations. With the dissolution of the personal 'I' personal suffering disappears.\\" (page 496)    \\"There is nothing to seek and find, for there is nothing lost. Relax and watch the 'I am'. Reality is just behind it. Keep quiet, keep silent; it will emerge, or, rather, it will take you in.\\" (page 520-521)    This is one of those books that you will want to use a highlighter and refer to again and again. As the book mentions, the little chick pecks at the shell until the light breaks through. Hopefully, the reader will gain not just valuable insight, but the experience of the light itself.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|As it stands now this is the best metal release of 2005,and the best new comeback thrash album this millenium.Early on when Kreator first started in the 80's i wasnt to keen on them,i went with the likes of Metallica,Overkill,Megadeth,Testament and Anthrax.But given this as the first album of there's i've ever heard in its entirety i can say that after many many year,i regret not listening to them.This album \\"believe it or not\\"from beginning to end is VERY  much like Reign In Blood,with a few more break down segments.I think even slayer would agree to this.Not knowing alot about the members(or even names) the singer definately sounds like the old pissed off Tom Araya from Show No Mercy,and he's i'm sure at least 40..wow.This music is abrasvie,fast,melodic and technical all at the same time,it sounds as though these boys have(had)never missed a beat,picked up there instruments and just started playing like it was 1983 and the birth of thrash.So if you like REAL old school,listen to this.I'm sorry to say that even OVERKILL(a fav of mine)can't come close to this these days,Kreator have put together one \\"hell\\"of a comback thrash album.10 stars.

B000002MFE|5.0|In 1992, the music scene was into grunge and alternative sounding rock. \\"Dave Matthews Band\\" was ready to spring into action, while Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Stone Temple Pilots were kicking it with their style of music. Some old favorites were riding off into the sunset. Billy Joel announced he would be giving up rock/pop music after his 1993 release of \\"River of Dreams\\". Elton John was relatively quiet at this time, as were other artists. Eric Clapton, the huge guitar genius of the late 60's and all throughout the 70's from England, was in a decline of sorts in his career. The 80's were not a strong decade for Clapton, who was exploring more the pop music side of the music environment. Clapton, who usually could adapt to different styles with ease, never found his niche with pop. Though he released \\"I Can't Stand It\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Heart\\", neither were big chart numbers. His fans were diwindling, and his time in the spotlight looked like it was running out. <br /> <br />Another popular trend in the 90's was unplugged shows. These shows would take musicians accustomed to performing with a variety of electronic instruments or tools and give them no electronics. Basically a true test of skill for many so called artists. Clapton, an electric guitar ambassador, took on the challenge. He put his Fender into the closet for a one night extravaganza. Equipped with an accoustic guitar and dressed relatively nice (suit, glasses, a hair cut), many Clapton fans might have been wondering who this man was. Was this their guitar hero? Looks more like a friend that mom or dad might have over for dinner. Clapton was dressed his age, but don't take that away from this. \\"Unplugged\\" is a truly enjoyable listening experience. <br /> <br />Though the album might be known for its two huge singles (Layla and Tears in Heaven), the bulk of the material is blues. Clapton, who has played a lot of hard rock in his day, always has called himself a blues guitarist. His passion for the blues ispresent here with many ditties, some of my favorites are \\"Before You Accuse Me\\", \\"Hey Hey\\", and \\"Down and Out\\". I think the first song on the album, \\"Signe\\", is a great number to start the album with it. An instrumental number, it kind of is Claptons way of saying, \\"yes dummy, I can play the accoustic guitar like I can the electric.\\"  <br /> <br />The two numbers that are popular on this album of course are \\"Tears In Heaven\\" and \\"Layla\\". \\"Tears in Heaven\\" is the very sad and melancholy song about the death of Eric's son Connor. Beautifully written and sung by Clapton, the lyrics, soul, and guitar weeping make for one of the most beautiful songs ever made, and one of the newest hits from the guitar man himself. Definitely a tear jerker though. \\"Layla\\" is a new version of one of Claptons all-time greatest hits. The original was one of Claptons hardest rocker numbers. He slows down the pace considerably on this remake, using an accoustic guitar and a much-slower beat. The result is amazing. I love both versions, but I have to say I like this version better. Changing a hard rock song to a light rock number and doing so successfully without butchering the song... only musical prodigies like Clapton have the ability to do that. Wonderful. <br /> <br />What also is fun is hearing Clapton interacting with the audience. From his \\"thank yous\\" at the end of songs to the \\"Let's see if you can spot this one\\" before Layla, you can sense he is having fun performing, that it's not a job for him, that it is in fact a joy. You can sense him smiling and enjoying himself while performing. <br /> <br />After being forgotten about for over 10 years, 1992's \\"Unplugged\\" showed that in fact Eric Clapton was still around and that he could still release prime material. The result of the album was two fold. On one side, Clapton ruled the top ten charts once again, had the top selling album of 1992, and took home a slew of grammies. On the other side, he made the dive from FM rock staple to his failed attempt at Top 40 pop in the 80's to adult contemporary staple. Though many artists get criticized when they reach that level, Clapton continues to release lovely songs and can use the guitar for art. Pick up \\"Unplugged\\" today, from one of the few guitar \\"gods\\" that are around today.
B00000612G|5.0|Richie Sambora, guitarist of the famed, New Jersey-bred melodic rock group, Bon Jovi, has once again taken a journey to embark on his second solo effort, Undiscovered Soul. <br /> <br /> Most reviewers would feel so annoyingly inclined to compare Richie Sambora with his bandmate, Jon Bon Jovi, as well as his work within the confines of the band as a unit.  This reviewer, however, is not even remotely tempted to do any such thing.  The band, Bon Jovi, have become an underrated band in the 90s as a result of an overly-fickle public.  To make matters even more grim, the band is overlooked by radio and MTV due to the fact that these media outlets think of Bon Jovi as a \\"hair-band\\" stuck in an 80s time capsule.  As a result, the members of the band have branched out to try other career avenues.  Jon Bon Jovi released a solo album of his own late last year, and he's presently tweaking his newfound acting career.  Richie Sambora has decided to let his wife worry about the acting while he continues to go down the road as a musical solo artist. <br /> <br /> Richie Sambora has always been one of the most underrated guitarists to hit the rock world.  Unlike his technical counterpart, Eddie Van Halen, Richie is more of a guitarist of the heart.  His instrument speaks to you, stirring up emotions inside you that are deep and to the core.  Don't be mistaken -- the man can play a fast riff of smoking, cascading notes, but more importantly, he can pull back and create beauty.  His musical roots lie in, not only rock and roll, but heavily in blues as well.  Like one of his biggest influences, Eric Clapton, Richie is not only a spectacular guitar player, but he can also sing and pen some delightful ear candy -- and he does it more than well. <br /> <br /> On Richie's first solo effort, Stranger In This Town, Richie's blues influences are strong and more than evident throughout the disc.  A seriously depreciated album, Stranger In This Town, fell through the cracks when the shift in musical tastes changed.  Despite this, it was a highly acclaimed piece of work made by fans and media alike.  This reviewer didn't think Mr. Sambora could top  his first effort, but she may have been wrong. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a hard-rock album, Undiscovered Soul isn't going to deliver.  However, if you're looking for beauty and depth, you'll find plenty here.  Though not as bluesy as Stranger In This Town, there's still some subtle blues influences intertwined throughout the disc.  There is a heavy tendency towards pretty, acoustic numbers -- plus there's two enchanting ballads, and a few mid-tempo, pop-oriented songs on here.  You have a hint of some hard-rock on here in two songs, but they're the minority.  Produced by Don Was and mainly co-written with the help of Richie Supa (known for co-penning a handful of Aerosmith tunes), this disc is very personal and to-the-heart while providing an exquisite musical backdrop that's pleasing to the ear. <br />  <br /> <br />Made In America:  An auto-biographical mid-tempo filled with a mix of acoustic and electric guitars, with some symmetrical keyboards thrown in, this song leans towards the \\"classic rock\\" style of a song.  The lyrics paint a picture of \\"growing pains\\" and having the dream of music in your young mind:   \\"Made in America, nineteen-fifty nine, born down by the factory, cross the Jersey City line.  Raised on the radio, just a jukebox kid -- I was alright.\\" <br /> <br />Hard Times Come Easy:  Up-tempo and catchy, this song is the first single and the most pop-oriented (as in, Top 40 music) on the disc.  With a harmonious chorus full of hooks and a beat that causes you to tap your foot whether you want to or not, this one is about the ups and downs of life:  \\"It's amazing, we go through changes, when times get crazy; it's up and down it's hot and cold.  These complications just keep on coming, there ain't no running; when it comes to life that's how it goes.  Round and round we go, sometimes it feels like we're on a roller-coaster ride.  Baby, don't you know, it could eat you up if you try to keep it all inside.\\" <br /> <br />Fallen From Graceland:  Co-written with Bon Jovi bandmate, David Bryan, as well as Richie Supa, this song is a real stand-out.  The beat is easy and searching, the guitars bewitching and hypnotizing.  This song swings like a lullaby as Richie croons softly through your speakers, hitting you somewhere in your soul.  The lyrics are beautiful and deep, touching the soul of even the most cold-hearted:  \\"There's a line that you cross, when you find out that you're lost.  When you world is closing in, and it crawls under your skin.  And the heart's always blind, when it's in this state of mind.  There's a burning light in this town for every heart that's broken down tonight -- here tonight.  You're stranded out there in the rain and you can't see past the pain -- tonight.  You've fallen from Graceland.\\" <br /> <br />If God Was A Woman:  A total blues, good ol' rock n' roll fest of a song chock-full of both tongue and cheek, this song is another major highlight.  Full of bluesy and jamming riffs, a dynamic drum beat, and all-out rhythmically smoking harmonica bits (played by none other than the Demon of Screamin', the Big-Lipped Blues Master himself -- Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, yours truly and this jam-fest of a song became instant best friends.  With David Bryan and Richie Supa once again assisting Mr. Sambora with the penned words, this song is about just what the title suggests -- If God was a woman . . . :  \\"If God was a woman, would you be impressed, if she showed up in high heels and a pretty red dress.  Would you make a donation or would you draw the line?  Would you yield to temptation or savor her wine?  If God was a woman, she'd come like an angel or a devil in disguise.  When she left in the morning, would you lose your religion or kiss your faith good-bye?\\" <br /> <br />All That Really Matters:  Another stand-out, thisis an aesthetic ballad filled with grand, lovely piano and ethereal guitars.  Richie's voice is filled with unabashed passion, proving this song to be heartfelt and a possible future wedding song contender.  Lyrically, it's about that one emotion we're all still obsessed with understanding:  LOVE.  With love comes the search for a soul mate, and with those of us lucky enough to find that person, and even for those who are still hoping to find, this song will pull at your heart-strings:  \\"There comes a time in someone's life, when you find the things that matter.  And every time we touch, the love runs deep, we realize it's ours to keep, and that's all that really matters.  You'll always be my sweet addiction; in this life, my saving grace.  You're all that really matters.  You know it's true -- ain't no me without you.\\" <br /> <br />You're Not Alone:  This is another favorite because of the very unique style and approach to it.  With distorted vocals, soaring guitars, and a heavy-hitting beat, this song is one of the heavier on the album.  Richie wrote this song around the time his daughter was born.  The subject matter is about unconditional love and support:  \\"You can be a million miles away; I will always love you.  You can be a thousand thoughts away; I'll always be thinking of you.  No matter where you try to hide, you are always going to find me; right where I belong -- I've been beside you all along.  Like some ancient star, forever we'll remain;  even if the sky should ever fall from grace.  If I die or fade away, in the end you'll always know -- you're not alone.\\" <br /> <br />In It For Love:  A pretty but simple acoustic number, this is a fine song, but not a standout.  On the contrary, it borders a bit on the bland side.  The lyrics are written well, and the melody is nice, but it falls flat in comparison to the other tunes on the disc:  \\"Life is a road, forever winding, where it leads us I don't know.  In it together, for better or worse, searching forour pot of gold.\\" <br /> <br />Chained:  A tune which starts out slightly bluesy and then kicks into a more pop-oriented tune, this one is another likable song, but more so for the lyrics than the actual music.  Musically, it's good but not outstanding.  There are some scorching guitar solos and flavorful riffs in there, and the beat is up, but not spectacular.  Lyrically, you can very well relate, which is the song's strong point:  \\"Hey, what's this feeling; I've never been down this far before.  I was scared of believing that love would never find my door.  I was chained -- chained to my broken dreams.  I never knew who I was suppose to be; waiting for someone to come and rescue me.\\" <br /> <br />Harlem Rain:  Another slow, acoustic number with pretty-sounding melodies, this song has a melancholy, searching feel to it -- much like Fallen From Graceland.  However, while this song is pretty, it's no way half as beautiful as the aforementioned.  It only scratches the surface of raw emotions, and like In It For Love, it doesn't stand out in comparison to some of the other material.  It does have a charming appeal to it, however, and is far from being a \\"bad\\" song.  The subject matter is about tough times experienced by the common folk:  \\"The old man down the corner is drowning in his pain.  I can see the sorrow in his eyes, his tears they leave a stain.  The streets have left him broken, he's in the final phase.  It's been a long, hard road -- from his glory days.\\" <br /> <br />Who I Am:   The other hard-hitting song on the disc, complete with heavy drums, eerie keyboards and guitar riffs, this song changes tempo.  It's starts rocking, switches to soft and mythical and then changes the tone again -- BAM! -- by hitting you over the head.  There's some shredding guitars in the middle of the piece, adding to the defiant tone of it.  Co-written by Marti Frederiksen (who co-wrote such tunes Something's Gotta Give  and Attitude Adjustment from Aerosmith's Nine Lives disc.),this song is about finding out who you really are:  \\"When I lost is when I learned, when the road took a crooked turn.  Wore a face of I just don't care, that piece of me just disappeared.  Help me now, help me now -- finding some hope inside myself.  Reaching down, finding out -- who's hiding in this shell.\\" <br /> <br />Downside of Love:  The other \\"ballad\\" on the album, this one is another favorite and major highlight.  Much different from it's sister ballad on this disc, All That Really Matters (which was more of a slow, classic ballad), this one is oh-me-oh-my-do-I-have-DA-BLUES!!!!  This song is probably the most blues-influenced on the disc (next to If God Was A Woman).  This is the blues, brother, and Richie wails is soooo well!!  This song is a prominent showcase for Richie's incredible vocal ability, and it shows that he's improved tremendously since recording Stranger In This Town.  The guitars are wailin', the \\"boards\\" are cryin', and Richie's vocals are soarin' with raw-boned E-M-O-T-I-O-N.  This is the blues, and we've got the blues because, with love comes the part that H-U-R-T-S  -- deep within the soul, brother.  You know the old clich -- Every rose has it's thorn, so maybe every love has it's downside:  \\"There's a danger of getting so close to you.  There comes a time when the walls fade away.  And when love turns to bitter blue; sometimes it feels so hard to stay.  Last night we went to bed angry.  We didn't mean what we said.  Seems we never get past forgiveness.  We try to hide, we never learn to swallow our pride.  On the downside of love -- where love turns to hate, we just can't relate.  On the downside of love -- when you're misunderstood -- cause when it hurts you, it hurts you so good.\\" <br /> <br />Undiscovered Soul:  A mid-tempo, upbeat, happy-go-lucky rocker, this song will be liked by anyone who appreciates a good Bon Jovi gem.  This sounds so close to a Bon Jovi song that I can see partner-in-crime, Jon Bon Jovi, covering this song.That seems almost comical to this diehard, but I can see that \\"I'm a cowboy\\" theme running through this song.  I can envision Richie with his trademark black hat and double-neck guitar, and Jon with his cowboy boots and fringe jacket.  Yes, I'm going back in time, but I digress.  The subject matter of this song is in that good ol' story-telling theme (a la Tommy and Gina from Livin' on a Prayer and Lie To Me).  I could almost see this as being the story of the \\"before\\" Tommy and Gina found each other.  Hey, I can use my imagination, can't I?:  \\"She was standing at the station, small town suitcase in her hand.  There were dreams she found inside her that no one could understand.  She never talks about her childhood, so much past to leave behind.  She's so scared to go, but still she says good-bye.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />In summary, Richie Sambora made a beautifully creative package of music that touches the soul and tickles the ear.  Once again, it's him and his guitar and I think, despite what critics and a capricious public may say, Richie Sambora is a man, and a musician, to be reckoned with.  While he will always be a very important part of Bon Jovi, it was more than a pleasure to hear Richie's own voice.  Being the other great half of the song writing talent that drives Bon Jovi, Richie (with the help of his Jovi bandmate, David Bryan on three songs, as well as a big helpful hand from Richie Supa on nine, as well as the input of some other fine artists) has written some deeply introspective, personal and reflective lyrics.  Many can lose themselves in his words and get some kind of meaning out of them.  The music is more beautiful and elegant than it is aggressive and hard-hitting, causing many a critic (I'm sure) to cry \\"Michael Bolton\\" -- but no matter.  Richie is \\"who he is\\" and that's something this musical climate needs a good shot of. <br /> <br /> In comparison to his first effort, Stranger In This Town, it is clearly evident that Richie has topped himself lyrically and at least called it even musically.  His voice has gotten stronger and he has more of a vocal range on this effort than on his previous.  This is not only a showcase for his writing talent and what he can do as a guitarist, but also as a vocalist. <br /> <br /> While there's one or two songs that are middle-of-the-road, there's not a horrible, or \\"bad\\", song on this disc, and there's many highlights that make it a shining star.  Here's hoping Richie and his Bon Jovi bandmates will return soon as a group, but here's also hoping we get to continue to hear Richie's individual (and so very special) voice (as well as bandmate, Jon's) every now and again.  As much as yours truly gets \\"da blues\\" from lack of new band material, she's glad Richie made this disc because it's become one of her new best friends. <br /> <br />  Written by Diane Trautweiler on  April 19, 1998.
B0006GAO3G|5.0|It takes a loan shark leading the way to make Hollywood honest. \\"Get Shorty\\" returns in a new 2 disc \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD just in time for the sequel \\"Too Cool\\" which will be premiering in theaters in March. Translating Elmore Leonard's novels to the screen can be a tricky business luckily both screenwriter Scott Frank and director Barry Sonnenfeld are both up to the task with an inventive dark comedic film. Chili Palmer (John Travolta) heads west to collect a debt from down-and-out B-movie producer Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman). When Harry can't pay, Chili opts to help him make a movie about, well, Chili Palmer. The catch is that Chili and Harry need a star to make their movie viable. Chili quickly finds that the film business shares a lot in common with the world of organized crime. Chili romances B-Movie queen Karen Flores (Rene Russo) an ex- of Harry's and persuades film star Martin Weir (Danny DeVito) to star in the film but not before running into a Cadillac of very funny mishaps along the way.  Featuring a great performances from Dennis Farina as the clueless Ray `Bones' Barboni, Travolta, Hackman, Russo, DeVito and a pre-Sopranos James Gandolfini, \\"Get Shorty\\" positively sparkles with wit and energy.<br /><br />Sporting a new high definition transfer \\"Get Shorty\\" looks simply marvelous. With a sharp looking transfer showing a minimum of digital artifacts and no analog flaws, \\"Get Shorty\\" deserves the deluxe treatment. The image has amazing depth and an image sharper than Chili's aim. The colors practically leap out from the screen brighter than Harry Zimm's blindingly white teeth from the moment the pink and blue titles pop up on the screen until the moment we hear \\"cut\\" at the end. With blacks richer and darker than Chili's stolen coat, MGM has done a superb job of translating this modern classic to DVD. The crystal clear sound comes across with more presence than B-Movie queen Karen Flores' screams.<br /><br /> Extras are exceptionally good in this \\"Special Edition\\". It's like having seconds of a terrific desert; while no one really needs it, it's great to have just the same. We get a number of notable extras as part of this rich meal. The second disc has three featurettes on different aspects of the film, the deleted \\"Graveyard Scene\\", outtakes, the \\"Get Shorty\\" party reel, a documentary from Bravo Channel on the making of the movie and a sneak peak at \\"Be Cool\\". \\"Get Shorty: Look at Me\\" opens the book on how Elmore Leonard came up with the plot for \\"Get Shorty\\" and developed the idea. DeVito, Travolta, Hackman, Russo, Sonnenfeld and other key cast and crew participate in this featurette on the production of the film. Full of clips from the movie to illustrate the points made throughout the featurette, it's a great summation of the greatness of this film. It's a 30 minute love fest reminding fans why they love this movie so much. The 20 minute \\"Get Shorty: Wise Guys and Dolls\\" focuses on the fun, complex characters of the movie. \\"The Graveyard Scene\\" featurette allows Sonnenfeld to comment on the single deleted scene of the movie included the hilarious, well, graveyard scene. Featuring a funny cameo with Ben Stiller, Sonnenfeld clearly regretted cutting the scene but Sonnenfeld couldn't find a place for sequence where it fit. The behind-the-scenes stuff and interviews last longer than the actual scene itself. \\"Going Again\\" features footage from outtakes and a discussion from Sonnenfeld about the technique of using long takes, pulling out the best bits and putting it together to make magic. The sneak peak for \\"Be Cool\\" promises that the sequel to \\"Get Shorty\\" promises to be as funny as the first film. Set in the music business, it may not be more than a promo piece for the film but it gives viewers enough of a taste to rope `em in.<br /><br />Bravo's \\"Page to Screen\\" documentary featuring Peter Gallagher features plenty of interviews with critics, other writers and focuses as much on how Elmore Leonard comes up withthe material in his books, writes them and, once again, takes us behind-the-scenes of the production of the movie. The real treat is hearing from the real Chili Palmer discussing the \\"reel\\" Chili Palmer and Leonard's character. The \\"Party Reel\\" mainly consists of bits and piece of cut footage and behind-the-scenes stuff nothing earth shattering or all that funny. In addition to the \\"Get Shorty\\" theatrical trailer and we get two promos one for \\"Fargo\\" and one for \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\\". My only complaint is the MGM \\"promo\\" opener that they put on ALL of their DVDs. It's annoying and, unfortunately, there's no way to pass it by. It's a pretty minor issue but the fact that it's on all of their DVDs makes it a real pain.<br /><br />A dry, witty commentary by Barry Sonnenfeld highlights this disc. The only drawback is the lack of participation of Travolta, Hackman, Russo and DeVito. I realize they have busy schedules but it would have been a real highlight and perfect addition to this DVD.<br /><br />A hip, funny comedy that continues to deliver in spades, \\"Get Shorty\\" looks terrific, sounds great and has some terrific special features. This is an example of a re-release that's worth upgrading. Definitely worth owing on DVD and purchasing a second time if you love the movie.

B00000JR29|5.0|Remember when the 80's brought us good quality pop? Madonna, Prince, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, The Cars, Duran Duran, Dire Straits? Tears for Fears belongs in the category of \\"good pop\\" with this, their biggest album. <br /> <br />The album is packed with three huge singles. \\"Shout\\" is powerful with it's dance like percussion and kind of dark tone to it. \\"Head over Heels\\" takes a love song, adds clever lyrics with some quality guitar, and makes it a wonderful piece of music. \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\", personally my favorite on the album, is a rocking number again with quality lyrics and ingenius instrumentation. Truly a masterpiece, and one of the greatest songs (in my opinion) ever cut. <br /> <br />Are you sick of the cookie cutter, American Idol, plastic pop that you hear on the radio today? Pick up \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" to be reminded of what Top 40 radio used to be.
B000002HPT|5.0|Falling Into Infinity <br /> <br />The time passage of four years had passed since the public heard any new material from Dream Theater.  Awake was their last studio release in 1994, with the EP, A Change of Seasons, being released in 1995 as a tide-over.  ACoS was a disc that primarily consisted of cover tunes, which were recorded live at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London, England (on January 31, 1995).  The only hint of what was to come for the future was the title song (saved from the Images and Words sessions and re-worked through the years), a magnificent monster of an epic, clocking at a full 23 minutes (proving to be DT's longest song ever, and the first song Mike Portnoy ever wrote lyrics to). <br /> <br />When 1997 arrived, Dream Theater released their fourth studio album titled, Falling Into Infinity.  Dream Theater fans absorbed this newest piece of work with mixed emotions.  At the production plate was Kevin Shirley, who produced Aerosmith's last disc, Nine Lives.  Many criticized Mr. Shirley for getting too much of a stale, compressed sound out of the bands he worked with.  No matter.  What I'm here for is the music . . . I could care less about the producer. <br /> <br />I just became a recent Dream Theater fan a mere three months ago.  Awake became my introduction to the band, and about a week later, I had gotten my grubby mitts on Falling Into Infinity.  What blew me away with Awake became even more of an obsession with FII.  That was it for me:  This band was my new best friend.  I BONDED with this band.  I had never heard anything like Dream Theater before on the musical plane, and on the lyrical plane, I was keenly interested in figuring out the complexities of their lyrical prose.  The words, and the music, were like pages from my own life.  I was living these songs, so that's where the bonding came in.   <br /> <br />In all senses of the word, Falling Into Infinity  was an easier album to swallow for a first-time Dream Theater fan, and it was originally my first choice for a first album, but I had trouble locating it in stores (for some strange reason). <br /> <br />Falling Into Infinity is more of a flowing, more direct album than Awake  had been.  There were a lot of tangents, and much meandering, on Awake, and with FII, it's a more direct approach.  Say what you may about producer Kevin Shirley, but the music is still there.  The trademark twelve/thirteen minute epics are still present, as is the complex, probing lyrical content, and the intricate musicianship.  Dream Theater still has their chops as a band, but now they can relax a little and enjoy it.  The only difference between FII  and Awake is there are more radio-friendly songs on this disc (although you know, radio will still ignore them because the songs are still too long for radio format). <br /> <br />In Falling Into Infinity, Dream Theater has all the depth and intrigue, all the aggression and the beauty, that they've always had.  Mike Portnoy still beats the hell out of his skins, John Myung still keeps the rhythm going with the best of them, John Petrucci still wails and shreds, and James LaBrie still howls, but with a slightly lower vocal range this time around.  The only master we're missing is Kevin Moore, who left the fold after the recording of Awake.  The band brought it Derek Sherinian, and he does a more than well job.  My second journey into the depths of the world of Dream Theater have been just as satisfying, if not more so, the second time around.  After exploring the avenue of FII, I was hooked like a junkie on drugs. <br /> <br />New Millennium:  The album starts out with a moderate heavy rocker with steady  drum beats, chiming `boards, and grooving guitars.  This song rocks, in a fast moving, grooving way, rather than an aggressive hit-you-over-the head, angry way. When the song winds down to the last fifty or forty seconds, there's a bit of grungy-sounding guitars before the song ends with the chorus.  Penned by Portnoy,who seems to have more of an input on writing some of the material on this album, this song appears to be about a change coming in life.  More often than not, the guys in this band don't mean exactly what they say.  This is a case where, more likely than not, this isn't so much about a literal new millennium.  In a sense, it tip-toes around that, but appears to have a broader sense of change in general:  With people, the planet, and how humanity has slowly been moving downhill.  Intelligently written, this song is strong in both a lyrical and a musical sense. \\"How can you keep your head, and not go insane/When the only light at the end of the tunnel, is another train./Lies ten feet tall, have broken my fall./Welcome you all new millennium./It's well overdue, and I can't wait to, welcome in a new millennium.\\" <br /> <br />You Not Me:   Starting with drum beats, and kicking into a funky guitar rhythm, LaBrie's voice sings with a low, almost dripping sensuality.  The chorus is hooky and hard to get out of your mind.  Petrucci still stands out by inserting various guitar noises, and by the steady way he keeps the song moving.  Very radio oriented, this song's lyrics were born out of the brains of John Petrucci and Desmond Child (who is known for working with several bands, including Kiss, Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, the now defunct Southgang, and even the legendary Cher).  Desmond is known for adding, \\"poppiess\\" to a song, and Dream Theater is no exception.  While this is far from your typical pop song, it's more commercial than some of their other songs, and is just about the shortest song on the album.  A great song, and really likable, the lyrical content seems to be about that suffocating relationship.  You know, the one where you're giving more than you're getting.  I only know too well.  \\"You're building my prison brick by brick./Eating your words is making me sick./You get what you want, cause nothing is sacred./You're reading my mind and leaving me naked./You say I gotta give before I receive it./One of these days I'll believe it./It's all about you, not me./It's all about the things that you're expecting me to be./There's not enough time to live, and all that you're expecting me to give.\\" <br /> <br />Peruvian Skies:  Creepy, trippy, and strangely beautiful, this song is a gem.  This tune hearkens more to something you might hear Pink Floyd do. Enchanting guitars and keyboards provide a background full of emotion in a laid-back way.  Halfway through the song it turns churning and heavy, almost industrial.  Petrucci has his moment with his screeching, superb solo before it goes back to sounding like Metallica in all their metal-grunge glory.  LaBrie is expressive throughout the song, but stays in low key, seemingly not as concerned with hitting the high notes on this album.  Penned by Petrucci alone, this one appears to be about abuse in some form, though I'm not exactly sure who the abuser is.  It could be a husband or father, but the abused seems to be a woman or girl, and the point of view that it's told from appears to be by an outsider -- such as a neighbor.  \\"There, there it is./I swear he's gonna murder that poor kid./Wait, I hear it again./Don't turn on the lights until we hear the way it ends./Under Peruvian skies, Vanessa regretfully waits./The story unfolds in her eyes, where midnight hysteria's no big surprise./Battered and bruised, always confusing the love that's she's losing for hate./Poor Vanessa.\\" <br /> <br />Hollow Years:  This one is an acoustic number, and I know many fans of rock music don't appreciate the slow songs as much as the rockers, but this is a really beautiful number.  It's lilting and swaying, with mainly an acoustic, keyboards, and a soft drum beat in the background.  LaBrie, once again, sings this song on the moderate key scale.  His voice is soft and eloquent without the calisthenics.  John Petrucci is, once again, responsible for the lyrics in this tune.  A song like this shows how good of anemotional storyteller Petrucci is.  The general idea of this song appears to be about the burdens we carry around with us in life.  It tells of a man who ran off on his family, and then a young woman who wants to connect with someone but doesn't know how due to her past pains.  What do they do?  They run, until they lift that burden, or that rock, that's been weighing on them.  \\"She's not the kind of girl, you hear about./She'll never want another, she'll never be without./She'll give you all the signs./She'll tell you everything, and then turn around and walk away./Carry me to the shorline./Bury me in the sand./Walk me across the water, and maybe you'll understand./Once the stone you're crawling under is lifted off your shoulders, once the cloud that's raining over your head disappears -- the noise that you'll hear is the crashing down of hollow years.\\" <br /> <br />Burning My Soul:  A chime of a clock and what sounds like the breeze of wind begins this song.  Slowly, it builds with eerily wicked keyboards, pounding drums, and heavy guitars that boarder on grungy and industrial. Aggressive and fierce, this song is like trying to drive down a pebble covered road.  LaBrie's vocals are distorted and gruff, hurling anger out of your speakers.  The highlight of this song is the absolute BURNING, but brief,  guitar solo by Petrucci.  When he ends it, it almost sounds like a scream escapes from his guitar.  Mike Portnoy took over the lyrical duties for this one, and it appears to be about a relationship gone wrong.  This relationship could be with a significant other, a friend, a parent, or a sibling.  Whatever it is, this relationship is destroying you from the inside out.  The `tone' of the song sounds almost as if the person is repressed and then explodes with ferocious anger.  \\"A thorn in my side, a chip on my shoulder/A lump in my throat, the size of a boulder/The chill up my spine, can't get any colder, and you wonder why I can't smile./A knot in my gut, an ape onmy back/In the heat of the moment, I'm knocked off the track/You drop the ball, I pick up the slack, and you ask me why my hair's gray./Twisting, turning/Losing all sense of yearning/Loving and learning/The pressure keeps on burning my soul.\\" <br /> <br />Hell's Kitchen:    This is an instrumental that really shows off the band's musical chops.  Petrucci in particular shows off a bit on this one.  There's a part in this, in the middle of all of his ferocious fret-work, that it sounds like he's strumming his guitar with a violin bow.  Jimmy Page was known for doing this, and the sound comes out wistful and haunting.  As with most of their songs, whether instrumental or not, the song starts a bit slower and then picks up speed.  They do this well, not drawing it out, but providing a pleasant musical experience.  A great number, it starts directly from the end of Burning My Soul, and then goes directly into Lines In The Sand, the next number on the disc. <br /> <br />Lines In The Sand:  This is a strong number, and the second to the longest on the disc, clocking in a little over twelve minutes.  The beat starts out moving, but not too heavy, while LeBrie sings with conviction.  As a special feature, Doug Pinnick of Kings X sings background and guest vocals on this one, adding a lot of soul to this song (making me want to check out  Kings X next).  This song is like going down a flume ride -- going down the hills fast, going through the bends, and just moving along.  Then, you get dumped into some calm waters for a bit and float for awhile. Before you know it, you're off again, going down more river falls.  A highly spiritual number penned by Petrucci (surprise!), the meaning of this appears to be complex in questions and ideas.  As with anything on the spiritual side, there is always more questions than answers.  It appears to convey the idea of looking both inside yourself for the answers, as well as outside yourself -- and outside the planes of the world.  It takes more than one listen to hear all there is to hear in this song, and understand all there is to understand.  A truly remarkable song. \\"Sometimes, in the wreckage of our wake, there's a bitterness we harbor and hate for hatred's sake./Sometimes, we dig an early grave, and crucify our instincts for the hope we couldn't save./Sometimes a view from sinless eyes, centers our perspective and pacifies our cries./Sometimes, the anguish we survive and the mysteries we nurture, are the fabrics of our lives./Swept away with the tide, through the holes in my hand./Crown of thorns at my side, drawing lines in the sand.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Take Away My Pain:  Bong-sounding drums and a very light guitar starts this song before it goes into a highly melodious beat -- complete with pretty keyboards, enchanting guitars, and an easy drum beat.  This song sways with almost a peacefulness, yet touches some deep sadness within the core of your soul.  This is the second ballad to appear on the disc and, once again, it's a wonderfully aesthetic number.  Petrucci, once again, penned the words to this, and it's dedicated to John E. Petrucci, his father who succumbed to cancer before this album was released.  The song is about the grief in dealing with losing someone you love, and feeling the person's spirit is still there.  I feel it's also about finding something to believe in that's bigger than us when you deal with such a grief, wondering if there will be an end to the pain.  \\"She was standing by the edge of his bed, staring at the message on their faces./He said `What else can you do, babe?  I guess I won't be coming home again.'/They just took away my promises; make them take away my pain./Take away my pain./Leave the cold outside./Please don't let it rain./Don't stumble on my pride./Take away my pain./I'm not frightened anymore./Just stay with me tonight./I'm tired of this fight./Soon I'll be knocking at your door.\\" <br /> <br />Just Let Me Breathe:  This song starts out heavy on the drums, then kicks into first grungy, then EXPLODING, guitars that wail.  LaBrie comes into the song with a slightly distorted sound to his voice that's brimming with seething sarcasm.  A good rocker in all senses of the word, but not spectacular, my favorite part is, once again, Petrucci's solos.  He explodes, and I can't even describe half the sounds he gets out of that instrument we call a guitar.  There's also a really cool keyboard solo that smokes right after Petrucci's solo three quarters of the way through the song.  Portnoy is responsible for the lyrical prose on this one. Quite simply, it's about the entertainment business, and how fickle it is.  It conveys how calculated it is that you act a certain way in the music business, and how you're dropped once the next big thing comes along.  Surely, the result being the demise of many a rock hero (i.e. Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain, who get an honorable mention).  \\"A daily does of eMpTyV, will flush your mind right down the drain./Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain, make yourself a household name./Just close your mind, you can find all you need with your eyes./The big machines take care of you, until you kill yourself and then the sales go through the roof./Calculated, formulated/Feed my head with simple thoughts and let me breathe instead of being taught./All bottled up and tearing at the seams./I'm bored -- just let me breathe.\\" <br /> <br />Anna Lee:   This haunting, viciously poignant ballad would stir up even the stoniest of hearts. Wistfully pretty guitars, cultivated pianos, and an emotional LaBrie -- who delivers this song with a prettiness and a passion -- drives the stake to the heart.  The only song on the disc penned by James LaBrie, this song is about the sexual abuse of a child.   \\"Helpless child, they invite your hands to fill their needs./Will you be the same?/Shameless smile, to steal from you the innocence that bleeds./Will they feel your pain?/Trying to believe, the scars unseen, the tears wash clean./You don't want to breath the air you breathe./You don't know how you'll live a life alone./She keeps holding on, holding on to you/Let her breathe the air./Don't want to be alone./Where do you belong, Anna Lee?\\" <br /> <br />Trial of Tears:  This is the longest song on the disc, clocking a little over thirteen minutes.  The song is called, Trial of Tears, and it's compressed into three parts:  It's Raining (the bulk of the song), Deep In Heaven (an instrumental), and The Wasteland (the ending).  This song is a nightmare to sift through, due to the intricate parts, but I'll try my best. <br /> <br />I:  It's Raining:  This song is not overly heavy, but it's moving and melodious, with a heavy accent on drums and some cool guitar riffs.  There's not as many \\"solos\\" of any kind on FII like there are on Awake and Images and Words, but Petrucci shines throughout this disc and continues to impress me.  I didn't like this song much when I first heard it, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  This song was written by John Myung, who usually writes one song per album.  He has a quiet, if not reflective, way of writing lyrics.  Try as I may, I'm not exactly sure what the song is about, but it appears to be about the idea of lost dreams and opportunities.  It's a bit on the despairing side, yet it's a bit hopeful, too.  \\"Take a look at yourself, not anyone else, and tell me what you see./I know the air is cold./I know the streets are cruel, but I'll enjoy the ride today./It's raining, raining, on the streets of New York City./It's raining, raining, raining deep in Heaven./I may have wasted all those years./They're not worth their time in tears./I may have spent too long in darkness, in the warmth of my fears.\\" <br /> <br />II.  Deep In Heaven:  A cool instrumental break of mainly Petrucci's guitar playing, it keeps the mood moving towards that confusing ending of despair and a little hope. <br /> <br />III.  The Wasteland:  Still the same song, but the finale part of it.  The idea of this is rather like the rebirth after death, or so I see it anyway.  \\"Still awake, I continue to move along, cultivating my own nonsense.  Welcome to the wasteland, where you'll find ashes -- nothing but ashes./Bringing change, bringing movement, bringing life.\\" <br /> <br />&lt;Sigh.>  It's no wonder I get exhausted after listening, picking apart, and reviewing anything Dream Theater does.  All in all, Dream Theater has put out another excellent piece of work, and if it wasn't for this disc and Awake, I wouldn't be the obsessed Dream Theater fan I am now. I'm like an eager pupil in class.  I can't wait to hear what else these guys have up their sleeves, and I still have yet to experience them in concert. <br /> <br />Falling Into Infinity is a genius of an album.  It's more \\"radio-friendly\\" than Awake, but no less brilliant.  The musicianship of the guys in this band blows me away, and the lyrics . . . I couldn't convey my emotions any better than they have.  Dream Theater has been my pain, and they have been my anger and aggression these past few months.  They have been another voice that makes me feel like I'm not alone in the flaming hell  I've been stuck in recently. <br /> <br />Yes indeed, this reviewer may have been a little ignorant on who Dream Theater was, and the way they played the game, but she's becoming more well-versed with her knowledge about them.  Due to the excellence of this album and Awake, I found myself getting Images and Words next, with A Change of Seasons shortly thereafter.  I haven't had the chance to check out When Dream and Day Unite, but I can say that each of Dream Theater's albums are special.  Like Falling Into Infinity and Awake, Images and Words is an album of incredible brilliance that blew me out of my chair.  In that album, I can see the Rush connectin that is made so frequently (although I'm far from being a Rush expert).  Each of these albums are special and have their own personality, much like having your own children. <br /> <br />I do say, I'm glad Dream Theater came into my life when they did.  I only wish I discovered them sooner.  Here's to hoping it won't be a very long wait for the next album.  Dream Theater is easily a band I'm going to continue to follow, with much vigor and interest.  My only hope would be that more of the world would discover them, for they're missing out on some truly phenomenal music. <br /> <br />  Written by Diane Trautweiler on August 16, 1998.

B00030590I|5.0|'Hero' is easily the best film released (at least in the West) last year. It rises far, far beyond the impressive standard set by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and leaves one inspired and awed. Set against the backdrop of some of the most important moments in human history it combines a sweeping, epic scope with a layered plot full of suprises and twists. But most of all the story of 'Hero' is almost secondary - ultimately it is only the chosen medium for explaining an ideal, a philosophy. It shows how the individual is irrelevant when compared to humanity as a whole and advocates selflessness and sacrifice for a greater cause than any few people's emotions and desires. It is a noble ideal, told in the most spectacular fashion immaginable.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I don't usually do too well with zombie flicks...I spend most of the movie with my coat over my face.  So I was torn when I first heard reviews of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" because while it looked amusing, it still involved zombies.  I am so glad I overcame my queasiness and went to see it! <br />This is not a zombie movie, it's a poke at common culture that happens to have zombies in it.  As they say, the mark of a hero is how he reacts to adversity.  The focal point is NOT the destruction caused by the undead but rather what happens to our hero in the aftermath.  Because Shaun is a hero.  He is Everyman, from his penchant for drinking in his favorite pub to his ignorance of his girlfriend's wishes to his lack of enthusiasm over his job and quest for respect which will never come, right down to his incessant channel surfing which keeps him from catching wind of the growing panic outside his door.  That's where the comedy is rooted, in the places where the audience can laugh at themselves because they really see themselves onscreen.  And then there are some simply hilarious moments, such as the one outside the pub when Shaun and his roommate sing drunkenly and think they are being backed up by a fellow drinker who we know is merely a moaning zombie.  Brilliant. <br />The message here is a simple one and is clearly illustrated throughout the picture, most obviously in the opening sequence: What's the difference between these people who shuffle blindly through their days and the actual zombies? The movie is brilliant and funny and scary at points as well...Perfect.
B000002JKA|5.0|Upon hearing Dream Theater's 1994 release, Awake for the first time,  one word came to mind:  Bizarre. Yes, Awake, was my first \\"taste\\" of  Dream Theater, and I was hit with something that I had not come across in my musical journey prior to discovering them.  It was indeed a bizarre trip, but bizarre in the most intriguing way. <br /> I must admit, until recently, I was not familiar with Dream Theater.  Me being a lover of music, however, and always being on the \\"look-out\\" for a new band to \\"obsess\\" over, I decided to do my research.  After hearing this band's name roll off the tongues of a few, I decided to scope the vast world of the internet to find out some information.  What I found were several web sites devoted to the band and a huge cult following.  It was then and there that I decided to see for myself what all of fuss was about. I decided to start with Awake, the highly acclaimed disc that was considered by many to be their \\"breakthrough\\" album. <br /> Dream Theater was born sometime around 1985 with guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung and drummer Mike Portnoy forming the nucleus of the band.  They were later joined by keyboardist Kevin Moore (who would later be replaced by Derek Sherinian after this recording), and then connected with vocalist James LaBrie (after a revolving door of vocalists had breezed through prior to his entrance). <br /> Awake is Dream Theater's third release, following 1992's Images and Words and 1989's When Dream and Day Unite (with a Mr. Charlie Dominici being responsible for the vocal duties during that time).  Regardless of my ignorance regarding Dream Theater's two previous efforts, I thought it was never too late to give a band a go -- especially one that had as much talent and uniqueness as Dream Theater possessed.  You know that old clich:  First impressions are important (though they should not be), and if that be the case, then Awake was a good choice to start with. <br /> Not a typical 80s band, Dream Theater came in after the wave of that era, releasing most of their material in the 90s.  Sure, they have the long locks (minus the glam), but their sound proves to be both unique and exciting.  They're what I would consider a \\"thinker's band\\", as the lyrical prose is complex and the instrumentation is even more heterogeneous and intricate.  It takes more than one listen to catch all the different instrumentation that is going on, and it takes just as long to get the gist of the lyrical content.  This reviewer, for the first time in her life, had to pull apart lyrics like she was diagramming sentences.  Their songs could mean different things to different people.  Judging by what I've read over  the internet, some are at a loss for the meaning of a song, while others are looking into a more mythical meaning, while still others see it simpler than that.  A first-time journey through the very deepest corners of the Dream Theater Galaxy is very bizarre, but fascinating and surprisingly refreshing, indeed.  Most certainly they're more of a progressive rock band than anything else, forcing many to compare their sound to early Rush. Their hauntingly hard-edged epics are truly new waters this reviewer has never treaded until now. <br /> <br />6:00:  A great way to kick open an album, this songs starts with heavy guitars, raging keyboards and ponderous drum beats.  This song is fast, but harmonious, with enough guitar licks (including a cool wah-wah guitar solo three quarters of the way through the song) and synthesizers to keep the true rocker at heart happy.   There's some sample inserts in here from the film, \\"The Dead,\\" though it  escapes me what it has to do with the song, but I'm still learning about these guys. This song is the first initial impression of Dream Theater, and from this song, I have concluded that the band is tight and seamless in their playing.  Drummer Mike Portney and bassist John Myung are on target with their rhythms, keyboardist Kevin Moore is fierce, guitarist John Petrucci is a true gem in all senses of the word, and vocalist Jamie LaBrie has a broad vocal range and depth, commanding you to sit up and listen.  While the guys in Dream Theater write the musical part of the songs collectively, they take turns penning the tunes, and this almost six minute opus is from the brain of  Kevin Moore.  This song is deduced to be about  Moore's decision with wanting to leave the band.  In a broader sense, I think it's about putting your dream on hold to make a \\"real living\\", and then it being too late to do what it is you wanted to do in the first place.  It's the idea of lost dreams, and the message is to not let it slip away while you still have a grasp on it:  \\"He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car.  It's nine o'clock but he can't get out.  He lights a cigarette and turns the music down, but just can't seem to shake that sound.  Once I thought I'd get over, but it's too late for me now.  I've got bases to cover.\\"  \\"But don't cut your losses too soon, `cause you'll only be cutting your throat.  And answer a call while you still hear at all, `cause nobody will if you won't.\\" <br /> <br />Caught In A Web:  Wicked, and I mean WICKED, keyboards layer this song.  I could almost see a big black widow weaving her web of suffocation, capturing her victim while it struggles to get out alive.  In the middle of this song, it goes on a tangent of grooving, jamming guitars and drum beats, continuing the fast-paced speed the album seems to be heading towards.  A LaBrie and Petrucci collaboration on lyric-writing, this song is creepy-sounding and fast, with LaBrie's vocals accenting less on his high vocal abilities (which he displayed on 6:00) to a more gruff determination. The interpretation of this song is a person being repressed by society.  You live the way you're suppose to, biting your tongue, holding things in, until you burst at the seams and explode: \\"I can't hold on any longer.  These feelings keep growing stronger.  Echoes that deafen the mind will bury my voice in their wake.\\" \\"Try to push me `round the world some more and make me live in fear.  I bear all that I am made of now, attractive I don't care.  `Cause even when I danced with life, no one was there to share.\\" \\"Caught in a web, removed from the world.  Hanging by a thread, spinnig the lies devised in my head.\\" <br /> <br />Innocence Faded:  Those who like melody and radio-friendly songs with a twist will like this song.  This one is more on the slower side, with pretty keyboards and melodious guitars.  LaBrie starts by singing in a hushed tone, hitting the high notes once the song gets to the chorus.  A very pretty song penned by John Petrucci, the lyrical content of this song is full of philosophical prose. I've come to notice that  Petrucci, in particular, can get pretty deep and complex when writing lyrics.  I understand this to mean several things, but the basic concept I get from it is it's about humanity and the way it's become.  People are cold and calculating, untrusting, disbelieving, and easily persuaded.  \\"Animation breathes a cloudless mind.  Fascination leaves the doubting blind.  Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead; the faithful live awake and the rest remain misled.\\" \\"Callow and vain, fixed like a fossil -- shrouding pain.  Passionless stage, distant like brothers, wearing apathetic displays.  Sharing flesh like envy in cages; condescending -- not intending to end.\\"  \\"Innocence faded, the mirror falls behind you.  Trinity jaded, I break down walls to find you.\\" <br /> <br />Erotomania:  This is a fast and furious instrumental that is clips of different songs from this album, as well as some songs from their earlier albums.  It goes from grunge to pretty, switching time changes like people change their underwear.  It's a cut and paste song of different parts of their other songs and it is the first \\"part\\" of a three-part section called A Mind Beside Itself, proceeding into the next two following numbers. <br /> <br />Voices:  Eerie and haunting, this song will send chills up and down your spine.  Chock-full of nails-down-a-blackboard synthesizers, stealthily moving guitars, and impressive vocal calisthenics by LaBrie, this songs starts out slow, creeping up behind you.  Then -- BOO!! -- it attacks you and your heart is racing as it carries you away to unknown lands.  There's even creepier voice sampling inserted in here by rap artist Prix-mo, who's reading from the book, \\"Cultural Revolution\\". Unlike the ever-evasive dialogue in 6:00, the dialogue in this song provides clues to what this song is about (A major clue here about the song:  \\"I don't wanna be here, `cause of my suffering, `cause of my illness.  Only love is worth having, only love is what matters, loving every people on equal terms.\\".).  Penned by the ever thought-provoking Mr. Petrucci, it takes awhile to grasp at the meaning of this song.  There's religious symbolism in this (as, I've found out later, is true with a bulk of the lyrics that Petrucci is responsible for), and a lot of symbolism in general.  So, I had to do a bit of research on this one, and take closer listen to it.  The general idea seems to be about Schizophrenia.  All I can say is -- simply fascinating.  \\"Voices protecting me -- Good behavior brings the Savior to his knees.  Voices rejecting me -- Others steal your thoughts, they're not confined to your own mind.\\"  \\"I'm lying here in bed, swear my skin is inside out.  Just another Sunday morning.  Seen my diary on the newsstand, seems we've lost the truth to quicksand.  It's a shame no one is praying, `cause these voices in my head keep saying . . . `Love, just don't stare.  Reveal the Word when you're suppose to'.\\"  \\"Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting, twentieth century Icon bleeding.  Willing to risk Salvation, to escape from isolation.\\"  <br /> <br />Silent Man:  This is the third part to the previous two songs.  It's a simple, enchantingly pretty acoustic number sung well, but what the hell does it mean?  People are so digging into this one that I actually came across an interpretation that it was based on Arabian Nights.  Well, maybe it very well is.  Like I said, I'm just learning about these guys.  In the dictionary, if you look up the word, COMPLEX, you will see a picture of this band in there.  No kidding . . .  So, what do I see this song to mean?  Well, again, the ever-elusive Petrucci pens this one as well, and what I interpret it as:  I think it has deep religious overtones, and I think it's about God, or the idea of a higher being.  The idea I get from it is this:  When something makes sense, God is listening, when something doesn't, where the hell is He?  He's responsible for peace, harmony, happiness and love, but where is He when tragedy, violence, hate, misery and death strike?  Maybe I'm going on a limb here, but it makes some sort of sense, no?:  \\"A question well served, `Is silence like a fever?  A voice never heard?  Or a message with no receiver?'\\"  \\"When there is reason, tonight I'm awake.  When there's no answer, arrive the Silent Man.  If there is balance, tonight He's awake.  If they have to suffer, there lies the Silent Man.\\" <br /> <br />The Mirror:  Mean and angry on the rhythm section, gaining speed and getting more ferocious with some smoking guitar sections in there by Petrucci, LaBrie sounds almost evil as he harshly hurls words of deceit at you.  Penned by Mike Portnoy (who tends to lean on the heavier and meaner side of the emotions), this song is so blatantly about betrayal.  There's more voice dialogue in here, providing more depth and intrigue to the song.  What's even more interesting about this song is the way the betrayal is portrayed.  It's the betrayed and the betrayer going back and forth with their \\"dialogue\\"  You get taken through the betrayal \\"act\\", to the accusation by the one betrayed.  The betrayed then goes through the anger, the hurt, and the mistrust.  The betrayer goes throughthe realization, and then the guilt.  The betrayer:  \\"Temptation -- Why won't you leave me alone?  Lurking every corner, everywhere I go.  Self Control -- Don't turn your back on me now when I need you most.  Constant pressure tests my will or my won't.  My self control escapes from me still . .\\"  The betrayed:  \\"Hypocrite -- How could you be so cruel and expect my faith in return?  Resistance is not as hard as it seems when you close the door.  I spent so long trusting in you.  I trust you forgot.  Just when I thought I believed in you . . .\\" <br /> <br />Lie:  This ghostly, uncanny song chock full of hard-hitting animosity is a continuation of The Mirror.  Thick, angry-sounding guitars with a brutish guitar solo, this song was penned by Kevin Moore, and continues with the betrayal theme.  Being in a situation much like this myself recently, it throws your anger in all the right places.  It's about that person you trusted, who TOLD you you could trust him/her, and then something happens where you get the knife stabbed in your back.  Who of us has never been through this kind of personal hell before?:  \\"Daybreak at the bottom of the lake, it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe.  And I won't get out `til I figure it  out though I'm weak like I can't believe.  So you tell me `trust me', I can trust you; just let me show you.  But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt `cause I don't know if I know you.\\" <br /> <br />Lifting Shadows Off A Dream:  Soft, lilting, and aesthetic, this song will sweep you away with it's hypnotic easiness and melodies.  LaBrie's voice sounds like a lullaby in this exquisite tune.  Bassist John Myung is responsible for the lyrics of this number, and it is apparently about the spiritual balance of the male/female relationship:  \\"He seems alone and silent, thoughts remain without an answer.  Afraid and uninvited, he slowly drifts away.\\"  \\"Moved by desire and fear, he takes a few steps away.  Lifting shadows off a dream once broken.  She canturn a drop of water, into an ocean.  And she listens openly.  He pours his soul into the water, reflecting the mystery.  She carries him away and the winds die slowly.\\" <br /> <br />Scarred:  This song begins with a piano melody, and what almost sounds like a violin (or a guitar being plucked by a bow from a violin), starting if off moody and temperamental, but later giving way to some more brow-beating rage. This song has it's own personality disorder because it shifts from one emotion to another.  Some more fretwork of cascading guitar notes are present during the ending part of the song -- and it's quite impressive, I must say.  Petrucci is more than good, and the S.O.B knows it and doesn't mind showing off.  This song is the longest epic on the disc, clocking in at a full eleven minutes.  Penned by John Petrucci, this seems to be another song full of symbolic poetry and complex emotions.  My interpretation of this opus of a tune is that it seems to be projecting the idea of a spiritual/emotional standstill.  The message behind it appears to be about leaving your pain behind, not taking stock in differences in opinions, leaving those not worthy of your trust behind, and moving on without regret:  \\"I never bared my emotion, my passion always strong.  I never lost my devotion, but somewhere fate went wrong.\\" \\"People in prayer for me, everyone there for me.  Sometimes I feel I should face this alone.  My soul exposed, it calms me to know I won't\\"  \\"Blood . . . heal me.  Fear . . . change me.  Belief will always save me.  Blood . . . swearing.  Fear . . . staring.  Conviction made aware.  Give up on misery, turn your back on dissent.  Leave their distrust behind, wash your hands of regret.\\" <br /> <br />Space-dyed Vest:  This is the Twightlight Zone, folks.  One of the most haunting, poignant songs I have heard in a long time, this one pierced me in the gut.  With a sinister-sounding piano and a heavily moody-sounding guitar riff in the background, this song rips atyou emotionally.  The vocals on this one are distorted and heavy, easily conveying the emotion of gloom. There's more sampling dialogue in here, from a commentary about O.J. Simpson to a sample from the Conan O'Brien show, to some samples from a Canadian series.  Penned by Kevin Moore, this one is about a broken relationship, and again, at this point in my life, it hit me with its mood and words.  That feeling of never opening yourself up again, the feeling of losing your soul, your zest, your concentration, because of someone who didn't have your best interests at heart . . . it only hit too close to home:  \\"Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding, a pool in the shape of a heart.  Beauty projection in the reflection, always the worst way to start.\\"  \\"Now that's you're gone I'm trying to take it, learning to swallow the rage.  Found a new girl, I think we can make it, as long as she stays on the page.\\"  \\"There's no one to take my blame, if they wanted to.  There's nothing to keep me sane, and it's all the same to you.  There's nowhere to set my aim, so I'm everywhere.  Never come near me again; Do you really think I care?\\"  \\"And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend, and I'll never be open again.  And I'll have no more dreams to defend, and I'll never be open again.\\" <br /> <br />Whew!! (wiping sweat off brow).  In conclusion, Dream Theater is one hell of a band, and Awake is one hell of a piece of art.  The musicianship and tightness in the group is mind-boggling (but maybe not so much so, as most of the members went to school for music).  They're all a group of fine musicians, and Moore's talent will be missed.  As a \\"keysman\\", he's a true stand-out, and as a song-writer, he's a major contributor.  Myung and Portnoy are a kicking rhythm team.  The key players on this team, though, are LaBrie and Petrucci.  LaBrie (who I read even took opera lessons), has such an incredible vocal range.  While some of the more macho, testosterone-driven male fans will complain ofLaBrie being on the borderline of \\"annoying\\" on occasion, there's no denying the man has a vocal range that boasts such variety it could only prove to be an asset to this band, as well as ANY band.  More bands could get farther if their vocalist had more flexibility.   As for John Petrucci . . . what can be said about this man?  He's a multi-talented individual with his songwriting abilities and his fret-work.  He's working his way up the ladder to claim his crown of Guitar God.  He's versatile and dexterous, and seriously a professional. <br /> <br />As a whole, the general public may not be able to take Dream Theater in one sitting.  They're a complex bunch of guys, and their ideas are complex.  In this day and age, if you think too hard, your brain hurts, and that is going to make it difficult for Dream Theater to hit the masses.  No matter, because they're already on their way up.  Some of us like to think, and if we get a brainache, we just take an aspirin.  They are unique and  heavy enough, while melodic enough, to be pleasing to many an ear.  I know, with my own personal experience, Awake came at just the right time.  Some of these songs, and the moods that interweave through-out the disc, are my own moods and emotions (sans the Schizo song, mind you).  Dream Theater arrived at just the right time, \\"Awakening\\" me.  This band is one destined for great things, and I'm glad I've gotten the chance to get to know them.  Without a doubt, next time we'll all be \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" right behind them. <br /> <br />  Written by Diane Trautweiler on June 13, 1998.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is the most AMAZING movie I have ever seen. Ever since I saw it its been all I think about. I have seen 3 times so far and I cant wait for thte 4th, 5th, and however many lol. The cast was just brilliant, Emmy Rossum has one of the most phuenominal voices I have ever heard and plays Christine Daae so well, she just amazing. Gerald Butler played the most enticing Phantom. Tall, dark, mysterious, and sexy all in one, with a voice that could melt anyones soul, stupendous. Now I have never seen the stage production but I have heard the original casr recording and I prefer the new voices to the old ones anyday.<br />Leave it to Andrew Lloyd Webber to take an already spectacular thing and turn it into something even more spectacular, having him work on the movie really helped keep the integrity of the story intact, it would not have been the same if he hadnt been a part of it.<br />In conclusion all I can say is GO SEE THIS. See it once and get caught in its spell, and trust me this is not a spell u want to get out of.
B0002YLC24|4.0|If you have not seen \\"Before Sunrise,\\" released nine years ago, I strongly suggest you rent that one before seeing this sequel. Otherwise, you will not be able to appreciate this movie to the same degree. <br /> <br />\\"Before Sunset,\\" having the same director and actors, is an 80 minute movie in real time capturing the second meeting of this magical soul mate-destined couple played beautifully by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. <br /> <br />First, the bad news - the movie is very talky. I was hoping for a bit more frequent subtle action and silence, as we see as they climb the walk-up. I'm also wondering why the very end fades on one specific character when I think a more suitable ending, and prelude to a third film, would have been a shot from a distance containing them both.  <br /> <br />Other than that, I have nothing but praise for this wonderful film that engages sensitive viewers. The subject matter and acting felt so real to me, as if we weren't watching a movie at all, but, in fact, Ethan and Julie as real people in Paris. <br /> <br />I am hoping we do not have to wait another nine years to see them again, but I'm prepared to wait if that is what it takes.
B000002WPI|5.0|Every song on here is worth at least a 4.5 or 5. This is a young Wu-Tang at their prime when they were angry, gritty, tough, lyrically great, and just wanted to play rough and have a fun time. Though some fans might prefer Wu-Tang Forever, nothing will top this one. Sadly they kinda sold out on The W & Iron Flag, the hits from those are still pretty good though. Back to ETW36CBS. Everyone's heard the 2 big hits C.R.E.A.M and M.E.T.H.O.D. Man, I believe, anyone who listened to rap back in 93-95 will instantly recognize them.<br /><br />Best songs: C.R.E.A.M, Can it All be so Simple, Shame on a [...], Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin' Ta [...] Wit, Da Mystery of Chessboxin', Protect ya Neck & M.E.T.H.O.D. Man.
B000063DFQ|5.0|Upon listening to this album initially, I thought it was pretty good, but not spectacular.  A few more listenings definitely changed my mind on that one.  Where eagles dare is a great way to start off the album with dickinson just belting out the chorus under some truly heavy instrumental work.  Revelations is a good track, but by no means the best on the album.  The flight of icarus is another track that's just really spectacular and has a truly driving beat.  Die with your boots on has good lyrical intensity and a simplistic, albeit catchy, chorus.  The trooper may easily be my favorite maiden song around if only for the first 30 or so seconds, let alone the rest of the song.  Still life is a nice and spooky song, quest for fire fits in nicely in the context of the other songs, but not quite good enough to stand on its own.  Sun and steel has some awesome vocal harmonies on the chorus and to tame a land, true to maiden fasion, is a spectacular closing epic. <br />TRACK RATINGS <br />where eagles dare 8/10 <br />revelations 7/10 <br />the flight of icarus 9/10 <br />die with your boots on 9/10 <br />the trooper 10/10 <br />still life 9/10 <br />quest for fire 7/10 <br />sun and steel 10/10 <br />to tame a land 9/10
B00005MKA1|5.0|Kaya, was recorded at the same time as Exodus.  25 or so tracks were recorded and 2 albums were to be made.  Exodus contained many of the harder songs, but also had some softer songs, but not as many here.  for the Kaya album there were 15 tracks left, and the 10 originally released in 1978 were Love songs, and Homages to the Power of ganja.  The band shows a rare different side that is actually quite beautiful.  Out of all the Bob Marley and the Wailers album's this album sticks out in my mind because it is so much different than the others.  the entire catalogue is unique, but Kaya really leaves a long lasting impression.  everyone knows the song \\"Is this Love?\\", but many of the other songs are classics and should not be over looked.  Sun is Shining, Kaya, Time Will Tell, Easy Skanking, and Running Away are all very good songs.  If you are looking for something more unique and different this album is most certainly for you.  If you are going to have a reggae collection, you shouldn't pass up on this recording because it is a real treat.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|My rating and the following refers specifically to the Director's Cut. I would rate the original theatrical release five stars. <br /> <br />This director's cut brought to mind William Faulkner's line about writers often having to \\"kill their darlings\\" in order to meet the demands of a work's wholeness and integrity. Evidently, Richard Kelly was forced to kill his darlings with the theatrical release, and the result was close to perfection, if not perfection itself. The film's emotional force was stunning; its mysteries challenging; its pace so good that hitting pause to get more popcorn was impossible to do; its soundtrack (to my mind) a tour de force. It worked terrifically as a film experience, being a beautiful \\"whole\\" work of art. Extras that included Roberta Sparrow's book were great ... who really wanted to read the book during the movie anyways? (Which we can now do in the DC.)   <br /> <br />Which does not mean a director's cut had no hope of working. Or even, maybe, revisions to the soundtrack (although I really think that was touchy business better left untouched). There were some good scenes deleted from the original, mainly between family members, and they didn't seem major pace-cutters. Fortunately, we do get those scenes here, but we also get the overwhelming force of the director's enthusiasm ... and WAY too much embedded detail of his personal vision.  <br /> <br />On the upside, there's a nifty freedom to that enthusiasm which translates well into the Darko world IF you are also enthusiastic and into \\"playing\\" with Darko. In other words, if you love Donnie Darko already, you may find this cut a lot of fun. The pacing's completely blown, and the ending comes across flat compared to the original. (Kelly gets too detailed and baroque at the end, thus the impact of the \\"Mad World\\" music montage--don't want to include spoilers--and last scene is severely undermined.) Yet it's great to have more Darko, however we have to get it. And I don't regret buyingthis. <br /> <br />But if you've never seen the original DVD release, I cannot recommend this DVD set to you over that one. You will probably wonder why a cult ever built up around this film ... what anyone saw in it. You'll be missing that visceral power and compelling wonder that makes movies great and leaves you wanting to see a movie again ... immediately, if possible.   <br /> <br />Donnie Darko was a little miracle of a film that cast a huge shadow. The director's cut joins many other films that try for bigness and achieve little ... unless, of course, in Darko's case, you've already seen the light and are into shadow-play.           <br /> <br />
