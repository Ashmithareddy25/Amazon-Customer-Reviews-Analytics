B0000027RL|5.0|This the best debut grunge album ever ( I bet alot of people didnt agree with that). But anyways this is an amazing album with alot of great songs. Black is on the top, black amazed me so did even flow and alive.Jeremy is an ok song but black was great. Mostof the other songs were good too why go is amazing and so is deep the others are alright porch kinda bored me tho. Just buy this you wont be dissapointed. <br />This tops off any debut grunge album.
0792151712|5.0|I loved this movie; however, I will tell you if you are expecting a historical and factual account of the past events you will be disappointed.  If you watch this movie wanting to experience a gamant of emotions and to be entertained you will be left satisfied. This movie had so many interesting characters, plots and themes going on at the same time.  I loved the period dress and etiquette.  The love story between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose (Kate Winslet) in my opinion is one of the great theatrical love stories in the history of the cinema.  The movie layout was impeccable-the way they went from the present day to the past through the eyes of the old woman (Rose).  The movie is a long one but it flows along and keeps your complete attention that you don't even realize the length of the movie.  I highly recommend to those who have not seen.  I can only imagine that it is a small population of viewers that have not already seen this wonderful movie.
B00005NB8J|2.0|I was completely and utterly dissapointed with the quality of the transfer on this DVD.  A great sci-fi movie like this one deserves better treatment.  It would probably look fine on a 27&quot; 4:3 television... but any larger, you'll see &quot;jaggies&quot; all over the place from the non-anamorphic transfer. <br />Apparently an announcement will be made in a few weeks regarding a re-release.  Hopefully with more attention to detail.  But, now I have to find someplace to unload this piece of tripe.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album is quite possibly the best Nirvana album to be released. Every single song on it is digitally remastered, adding a completely new feel to some songs. I noticed the biggest diferrence in \\"Been A Son,\\" \\"Lithium,\\" and definatelt \\"Pennyroyal Tea.\\" It is hard to describe how great this album actually sounds. If you are not into Nirvana currently, you will be after listening to thie album. If you are already into them, then man, this album is definately for you!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|RATM is very unique.  They are one of the few bands that I am into that peaked with their debut album.  Their self-titled was better than Evil Empire, Evil Empire was better than the Battle of L.A., and this album is better than Renegades.  Their first album was a landmark album and was way ahead of its time.  I guess when I think of the latter three albums, each sticks out in my mind for one killer song: \\"Bulls on Parade\\", \\"Guerilla Radio\\", and \\"Renegades of Funk\\".  But with their first album, their was no clear best song.  They all rock!  Still worthy without a doubt though.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am a man of few words, but what can I say other than simply &quot;WOW!&quot;.  What an amazing accomplishment.  You are, without a doubt, the single greatest female voice I have EVER heard.  You bring chills down my spine and a tear to my eye.  Tears of joy. Tears of happiness.  Tears of amazement that we are so blessed to be able benefit from your immensly talented golden voice.  Thank you for staying here for us.  If you ever quit singing, you will not be hurting yourself, you will be hurting us.  Again, thank you Christina.
B000066NW0|4.0|I listened to thie first five tracks of this cd on Amazon and they were good. Damn good. Track six is awesome, too; but then the slowly get worse and worse....until you end on the very good closing song, \\"Naked.\\" <br />1) Losing Grip - 10/10<BR>2) Complicated - 10/10<BR>3) Sk8ter Boi - 10/10<BR>4) I'm With You - 9/10<BR>5) Mobile - 10/10<BR>6) Unwanted - 10/10<BR>7) Tomorrow - 3/10<BR>8) Anything But Ordinary - 2/10<BR>9) Things I'll Never Say - 6/10<BR>10) My World - 1/10<BR>11) Nobody's Fool - 5/10<BR>12) Too Much to Ask - 7/10<BR>13) Naked 9/10
B00006LLNU|5.0|If there is one album that can unite the world, this is it...
B000059PPN|4.0|\\"The House by the Cemetary\\", is probably, in my opinion, Lucio Fulci's second best work.  Well maybe it's tied with \\"The Beyond\\".  Anyway, this movie definitly ranks right up there with the all time scariest movies I've seen!  Of coarse the actors aren't good, the voice overs aren't good, but I'll tell you now, that Euro Horror, just scares the crap out of me.  It's dark, sadistic and wonderful!  If you are afraid of basements, dark rooms, cemetarys, or gore, you will definitly become scared many, many times during this masterpiece created by the miestro: Lucio Fulci!!!  Great movie, buy it on DVD, the transfer was pretty good.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|Em continues to provide his standard excellent performance on his five cuts. By now, we've all heard \\"Lose Yourself,\\" the inspiring anthem he delivers with a Pac-like passion similar to \\"Soldier,\\" \\"Sing For the Moment\\" and \\"'Til I Collapse\\" from \\"The Eminem Show.\\" What detracts from this album are the R&B cuts that don't fit and seem misplaced inserted between hip-hop tracks. Gangstarr, Jigga, Nas and 50 Cent provide solid cuts, while one surprise is the eerily commercial sounding track from legendary mic God Rakim, which really isn't that bad, but hopefully isn't a precursor to an Aftermath Ent. debut of the same fair.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is well worth the wait! <br />I'm so glad Christina shed that girl-next-door, no-risk-taking, cookie-cutter style of music from her debut CD. With Stripped she's expressed herself musically without relying solely on her amazing vocal talents. The songs have much more of an edge. They feel like there's actually a real person behind the lyrics. Her writing skills impressed me as much as her voice did back in 1999. As far as songwriting goes, Christina and Scott Storch and Matt Morris are the dynamic trio.<br />Christina's ballads continue to be strong. Impossible with Alicia Keys is my favorite. Dirrty, while slightly over-produced, is still a great dance track. Infatuation, one of the sexiest songs I've ever heard, is absolutely the best track on the CD. After listening to it, I wanted to run right out and find a Latin lover of my own.<br />Christina, whether you sell just two discs or 2 million, you've made a great CD. Be proud! You made the right decision to stand up for yourself instead of letting \\"experts\\" in the industry maket you as something you're not. For the most part, your creative instincts were right on with Stripped. It's nice to know there are artists in the business who are in it for the love of making good music and not for the love of making money.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Of all the greatest hits collections on the market, this is the one we were missing the most. Originally intended for release to celebrate the ten year anniversary of 'Nevermind,' the all-to-nortorious court battle delayed the release. But finally the wait is over. While it's sad that the intended box set was cut down to a single disc, this collection is a good one. The inclusion of 'You Know You're Right' makes the collection that much better. The accoustic versoin of 'All Apologies' along with the David Bowie cover 'The Man Who Sold the World' from the Unplugged session fit especially nice. For the Nirvana fanatic, many other favorites like 'Drain You' and 'Serve the Servants' are missing, but hopefully we will see the box set that was originally intended sometime in the future.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I really like the sound production on this album.  I call it Hybrid Rock because it is really overproduced to sound more like techno.  But its different than Marilyn Manson and other quasi techno influenced rock. This music is trippy, every song kind of sucks you in and carries you away with it. \\"Echelon\\" is a masterpiece, you really experience this song when you hear it.<br />Normally I go for White Stripes or classic rock like The Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin, but this group and Linkin Park may be carving a niche in modern music with Hybrid Rock.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|I went out and bought the 8 mile cd yesterday, and I must say i was quite surprised. i love the new song by eminem, lose yourself. It was my first exposure to 50 cent and boomkat, and i must say, it was very good. Most soundtracks have one good song, but this 8 mile is good, all 16 tracks of it. The macy gray song is a nice slow touch also. I find it quite interesting that Nas and Jay-Z show up on the same cd, is the so called beef over. Well definitely go out and buy this cd. Eminem again gives you something different. A very vivid yet personal outlook of a rap style.
B000000W5F|5.0|Even Bill Gates can't turn me off this tune! Officially as good as it gets, \\"Waiting for a friend\\" has been voted most favorite song on at least one online survey. You gotta have this on hand for those times when everyone left standing wants to rock 'n roll.
B00005U122|5.0|Roger Waters at his peak performance. This DVD comprises from the very early Floyd ages (Set The controls...) through the most creative era (Money , Wish You Were Here) till the latest solo creations (Pros and Cons...). It resumes creativity, power, and emotions. Nothing would be a surprise considering it comes from that huge musician, of course. But youll be amazed about how songs are played. Guitar players (there are three in some passages) have their own mood and, though no one could rival Gilmour, it is true that you will not miss him there. <BR>Camera is very good, direction does not abuse of video effects, therefore video never distracts your attention from the music.<BR>Sound is tremendous: Dolby 5.1 makes you feel in the midle of the audience.<BR>Whether you agreed or not with Waters departure from PF, whether you like or not an average album that was Radio Kaos, give a chance to this DVD. Youll not be disappointed.
0441003257|5.0|My husband said I would laugh out loud, and I didn't believe him. I did! This book was great! I tried for months to find it used, but couldn't. Now I know why. This is the perfect book to read over and over again!
B000022TSW|5.0|Before watching this movie, I didn't expect this movie to be a musical, but I did know that movie was rated R. And I reccomend this movie to any one, who has seen the show, not have seen the show, or never heard of South Park. The only song I knew that in this movie is Blame Canada. Which is the only song nomiated for best oringal song. As the movie opens, Kyle, Stan, Eric, and Kenny try to get in a movie starring Terrance and Phillip, but he movie had been rated R. They bribe a homeless man, and bring up swear words and uses them in school. Which leads thier parents to have to go to school, and learn that they were swearing in class. Which one of the mothers start M.A.C (Mothers aginst Canada). The songs in this movie include Mountian Town, Shut Your Face Uncle, It's Easy MMMKay, Blame Canada, Kyle's Mom is a, What Would Brain Boitano do? Note that most of the songs I listed has swear words in the title. And one more note, this is one of the rarest animnated movies not for kids, so parents please don't let kids/teens under 17 to watch this movie.
B00003BDXG|4.0|I don't believe that there is another film that better epitomizes what a postmodern work of art is.  Does that mean it is a great...even good...movie?  I honestly don't know.  NBK entertains me, amazes me, disgusts me, traumatizes me, makes me laugh, horrifies me, etc etc.  I haven't the slightest idea what Oliver Stone intended this thing to say or do.  I know that supposedly it was a protest against the media's penchant for sensationalization but I don't buy that.  I think it's just an amazing, technically complex (and yet ultimately shallow) pastiche of largely stomach churning images.  As a quintessential product of the late 20th Century, it is invaluable.  It simply exists.  If nothing else, it is an overloaded textbook of film styles/techniques.  In the end, probably much ado about nothing.  But it cannot be ignored.  And that's more than I can say for most of the utterly worthless pablum that the 'artistes' of late 20th-early 21st century America have foisted onto our culture.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This has probably been one of the most awaited cd's all year long.  I am glad to say that it has been worth the wait.  This cd is all around excellent in vocals, production, lyrics, and all of the songs strongly relate.  Christina has one of the best voices I have ever heard, and never oversings unlike some other diva's.  Stronger moments on this cd include \\"Walk Away\\", \\"Fighter\\", and the beautiful \\"Beautiful\\".  Anyone can relate to the song \\"Beautiful\\", and knowing all of the jealousy this young lady has saw she is not going to let anyone bring her down because she is beautiful no matter what they say.  A personal favorite of mines \\"Impossible\\" along with Alicia Keys shows a R&B side of Xtina, this is Aretha Franklin material.  Well I couldn't possible run out of good things to say about this album...  BUY THE CD!!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Finally allowing herself to be herself, Christina Aguilera returns with this remarkable disc.  She calls the disc \\"Stripped\\" because she has stripped away all the hype, all the glamour, all the prepackaged material she's been \\"known\\" for, leaving just herself.  She starts the disc off with saying she wants to reintroduce herself, and what you get is an amazingly talented young woman with a lot of worthwhile things to say.  She wanted to be in control of the project, so she cowrote almost all of the songs and produced one of them.  Her collaborations were well picked, the lyrics of all the songs amazingly fresh for someone so new to the writing game, and of course, there's \\"The Voice,\\" which has never sounded better.  Gone are the overproduced vocals of \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" and \\"Blessed,\\" here is the true Voice we heard in \\"Nobody Wants To Be Lonely\\" and \\"Lady Marmalade.\\" Working with Linda Perry brings out a different facet of The Voice and, gosh darn it, that works too!  The shift from \\"teen pop\\" to R&B seems so easy, because her voice is made for it, and we love it!
6305971099|2.0|Halloween 5 is a weak and disappointing entry into the series.  The events in H5 pick up where they left off in the far superior and enjoyable Halloween 4.  When we last saw Michael Myers, he had been shot multiple times and left for dead after falling into a mine shaft.  True to form, Michael is alive, if only barely, and escapes only to be nursed back to health by an unsuspecting future victim.  Meanwhile, young Jamie is in under the psychiatric care of Dr. Loomis following her attack on her stepmother at the end of H4.  The promising and surprise ending of H4 is all but abandon as this movie becomes little more than a teen slasher flick.  Michael spends a good portion of the movie chasing down a handful of teens that really have little or nothing to do with the story.  In fact, they are so annoying that you can't wait to see them knocked off.  Unfortunately, Jamie's stepsister Rachel is killed early in the film.  Donald Pleasance turns in his usual spectacular performance.  The series also saw the introduction of the mysterious man in black, setting up the next (and even worse) sequel.  Even though the events of H4 - H6 are ignored in H20, these could have been a nice \\"mini-series\\" within the series.  The Halloween series was rejuvenated and off to a promising start with Halloween 4.  It is unfortunate that the story took such a cheesy turn.  As is typical of Anchor Bay, the DVD audio and video are top notch.  Die hard fans will probably want a copy for their Halloween movie libraries.  Other may want to steer clear and move on to H20.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Finally allowing her to be herself, Christina Aguilera has returned with this remarkable disc.  She calls the disc \\"Stripped\\" because she is stripping away all the hype, all the prepackaged material she has been \\"known\\" for, leaving just herself.  She starts the album asking permission to introduce herself, and what we get is a remarkably talented young woman with a lot of worthwhile things to say.  She was in control of the project, so most of the songs are written by her and she produced one, as well.  Her collaborations are well chosen, the music fits her fabulous voice, and then there is The Voice, which has never sounded better.  She made the switch from \\"teen pop\\" to R&B with \\"Nobody Wants To Be Lonely\\" and continued with \\"Lady Marmalade,\\" but \\"Stripped\\" showcases that Voice in it's R&B richness in a way that delights and makes you wonder what's next.  Her collaborations with Linda Perry are more rock-ish than R&B, so that adds another layer to The Voice, and it fits there too!  Gone are the overproduced vocals of \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" and \\"So Emotional,\\" here to stay is the true sound of the aformentioned Voice, and one can only say \\"good for you, girl.\\"  Buy the CD.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This was a complex movie requiring several viewings to unravel the clues and solve the puzzle.  The movie is more along the line of Blue Velvet rather than The Straight Story (both directed by David Lynch).  However, I found the DVD rather disappointing.  There was no way to access individual Chapters to go to exact sections of the movie.  It ran just like a VHS tape. To return to a spot, you must actually put the DVD on rewind.  Further the DVD has a bad flaw.  It stops suddenly after about 90 minutes.  Since there are no Chapters, it's not possible to simply jump to the next Chapter.  After much trial and error, we figured out we start the DVD from the beginning at fast speed until it fast forwarded past the stopped area.  I returned the DVD twice for a new copy; all 3 copies have this flaw, so it must have been manufactured that way.  The DVD is pricey and has no extras except for Cast bios.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have waited a long time for this album and I must admit this album was well worth the wait.  Christina proves why she deserves to have received 3 grammys.  Her voice is superb.  The songs on her first album were good, but these are better.  She shows more versatility with her song choices.  One moment it's hip-hop, the next a ballad, the next jazz, and the next rock.  Everyone should get this album.  Her song about her abusive father is really good.  I see a grammy for the song &quot;Beautiful.&quot;  As Christina says, once you listen to her and compare her and Britney, there is no competition.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|For those of you not familiar with The Clash and whose idea of punk rock was the choas, bedlam and panic besotted by the Sex Pistols - you are all in for quite a shock.<br />The Clash are the definitive punk rock. Staffed with stellar musicians, two superb songwriters in Mick Jones and Joe Strummer and armed with a fiery leftist political ideology, The Clash proved everything that punk rock could be intelligent, relevant and non-confrontational.<br />There's punk and reggae, but there's also rockabilly, ska, New Orleans R&B, pop, lounge jazz, and hard rock; and while the record isn't tied together by a specific theme, its eclecticism and anthemic punk function as a rallying call. While many of the songs  are explicitly political, by acknowledging no boundaries the music itself is political and revolutionary. But it is also invigorating, rocking harder and with more purpose than most albums, let alone double albums. Over the course of the record, The Clash explore their familiar themes of working-class rebellion and anti-establishment rants. The result is a stunning statement of purpose and one of the greatest rock & roll albums ever recorded.
B0000027RL|5.0|Along with Nirvana's NEVERMIND, Soundgarden's BADMOTORFINGER, and Alice In Chains FACELIFT, &quot;TEN&quot; by Pearl Jam remains not only a seminal proto-grunge work, but the band's most cogent and powerful statement.  From the fury that builds in the opener and continues thru the first half of the album, to the beauty of &quot;Garden&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Release&quot; TEN is a brilliant album.  Despite what a few have noted, the production here is wonderful-the songs are extremely high-caliber and the engineer &amp; producer did a wonderful job of capturing the energy of the band.  TEN is wonderfully free of the self-imposed 'hermit' outlook that came to plague the band in more recent years.  It is free of the obnoxious self-importance of the bands later works as well.  The story of Pearl Jam is the story of a band that started with so much promise and lost its way.  The band has been one of the bigger disappointments in rock history after this album and its sibling &quot;VS.&quot;  Pearl Jam seemed to lose focus, energy, and power as time went on.  Perhaps they did not know how to handle the success of TEN.  It always struck me that they bent over backwards to try to do 'something' different-to separate themselves from this album.  I've never quite understood that.  In any case, TEN remains a solid listen and an essential part of every rock collection.  In twenty, thirty, or forty years, people will be playing this one-long after NO CODE, YIELD, and VITALOGY have been stomped into dust.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's CD is amazing. Everyone needs to go out and buy this right now.  I was amazed by this CD Her voice has grown and she sounds amazing. The songs are meaningful and they are just really pretty songs, They really portray her in a good way and show us who she is. For aspiring singers such as myself, this is the perfect CD to test your vocal range. There is just really one word to describe this cd and that is AMAZING!!
B00005U8EM|4.0|Life could be MUCH worse.  Embittered weatherman Murray takes on small town Pennsylvania, covering groundhog day with his new boss MacDowell and creepy camera-guy Chris Elliot (in one of his few understated and enjoyable roles).  This comedy came in under the radar-it was not a big hit, but it has the stars and script that should have made it one.  Bill Murray is PERFECT for this part, and any collection of his classic film lines, from GHOSTBUSTERS and CADDYSHACK thru the present would have to include at least a couple of the following from this film:<br />&quot;I'm guessing March 22nd.&quot;<BR>&quot;I'd love to stay and talk...but I'm not going to.&quot;<BR>&quot;I'm BOTH!  I'm a celebrity in an emergency!&quot;<BR>&quot;Yeah, they're hicks Rita.&quot;<BR>&quot;Morons!  Your bus is leaving.&quot;<BR>&quot;Well what if there IS NO TOMORROW!?  THERE WASN'T TODAY!  Hello?&quot;<br />I can't say much for the special edition treatment-there isn't really anything here to speak of.  Commentary is nice, but it's obvious that not too much time or effort was put into this.  The film looks good and sounds good and that's all I really care about.  If you have passed over this film year after year in the video store-try it.  It takes a hardened man and redeems him by the end!  Very uplifting and funny.
6305127689|5.0|Tom Cruise has made a lot of great movies, but &quot;Top Gun&quot; is the best movie he has ever created. Cruise stars Maverick, a fighter pilot, who goes to the Top Gun Naval School with his partner, Goose played wonderfully by Anthony Edwards. He falls in love with a civilian instructor, Charlie played flawlessly by Kelly McGillis. The picture and sound quality from the DVD are good, however there are no extras. I hope that someone will re-release it on the Special or Ultimate Edition with special features including the featurette or documentary, the production photos, the deleted scenes, and the commentary. If you're a Tom Cruise fan, you must buy &quot;Top Gun&quot;, if you don't own it. An excellent movie!
B00003CX9Q|2.0|E.T is one of the best family films ever made and one of the highest grossing films of all time, Universal really botched this dvd release on many levels, First off there is no audio commentery by anyone, i know speliburg will not do commenteries...Enough complaining let me complaiment on the few things universal got Right the Galleries on disc two are nice  photos of memborillia and production photos, drawings of E.T etc, The sound is great and I like the option of Having both versions of the film, The only other dvds I own and am aware of that feature movies on both discs are Sherk and Glory which are only formatted differently on each disc. Bottom Line this Dvd is far from what i would have liked for E.T , but it's better then nothing if your a die hard fan. Please note the two star rating is for the dvd release the movie itself is a five.
B00006CXXU|3.0|The teen pop sweepstakes has gone bust and many of its leading champions are having a hard time crossing over to adulthood and broader appeal. That is not the case with Ms. Aguilera, who has revealed a strong hand in creating the kind of introspective pop album that rivals Janet Jackson's groundbreaking \\"Control.\\" While \\"Stripped\\" does not have that kind of visionary production, it does feature some stellar performances from Ms. Aguilera, who definitely surpasses her teen pop rivals in sheer vocal power.<br />While \\"Dirrty\\" has been given the brush because of its out-there video, the song really does move. Songs like \\"Soar,\\" \\"Underappreciated\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" are truly skilled interpretations of emotion and strong writing. This is truly an adult pop album of worth and worth a listen. Scrape off the tacky drag of her stylists' bad taste and there is an artist revealing some true growth. Her evolution continues and it is going to be interesting to see and hear what happens next.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am glad she took the time to write and produce her second album.  Unlike most artists who are just throwing albums out every year, I can't see how they can put their heart and soul into the album like the way Christina did.  Her tracks are amazing.  Regardless if you like the way she looks or not, her music is awesome.  Her vocals are off the hook as well as her tracks being musically eclectic.  Stripped gives you a taste of R&B, rock, blues/jazz; no more bubble gum pop for this woman.  She has matured and has come forth with her true self, her true form.  Negativity will fly with her 360 change in the public eye, but yet, like other artists who get controversy and criticism, you must listen to the lyrics, the music.  She is definitely an artist who took her time to put her all in each and every on of her songs instead of thinking what songs will make me a hit.  This cd is one that you could listen to all the way through without skipping over from song to song.
B00000IAU3|5.0|From the opening bars of &quot;Here With Me&quot;, the seduction of the soft but subtly penetrating voice of Dido and her music (Who is<BR>responsible for nailing these creative, sympathetic and perfect arrangements for this young songstress!?!?!), melodically rich, atmospherically enchanting, heart-to-heart conversive, will win you over into levels of your finer soul as well as human heart.  With her exceptional beauty and modest demeanor, but definite alive-feelingness conveyed, and her mystique (not just feminine but as in mystical, yes) the gilding of the lily for one's attraction to her phenomenon is complete and unimpeded.<br />But the 99% is the songs, the delivery with conviction, the gentle but rapier-tranchant force and beauty of them, within their arrangements of simple, quiet genius, that are the (big) game here.  I guess &quot;Here With Me&quot; is the big attraction, but there is no need to ever hit the skip button. Actually, &quot;Hunter&quot; hooked me first (you've got to love that cover photo of the CD-single, secondarily), and &quot;Thank-You&quot; has become a Smooth Jazz staple.  I get out of the way and sign off now so any of you not yet acquainted (somehow) can go out and buy this album.  Quiet listening, but quite a listening experience.  Just hoping Dido will listen to her better angels and maintain the musical standard and quality with her next offering, so we can enjoy the enthrall a little longer and not come down to earth again yet too soon.
B00006V9A0|5.0|The prize on this cd is You Know You're Right, a song which has been hidden in Krist Novoselic's basement for eight years.<BR>You Know You're Right is a blisteringly passionate song, and the fact that it is the very first track on the CD is perhaps an after-omen of Smells Like Teen Spirit's success at having the same track number on a different album which sparked fans interest nearly eleven years ago: Nevermind.<BR>Following the much hyped- 'YKYR' is digitally remastered versions of songs such as, Been A Son, Smells Like Teen-Spirit and Come As You Are. There are many great songs on this CD and it is definitly a good starter album for any new fan.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This is much more simple than Agaetis. But it's much more emotional in my opinion. Slower climaxes are much more worth the wait. This isn't pretentious ..., they're just making the most beautiful music they can make. 5 stars. Amazing, utterly amazing. Please pick this up, listen to it with headphones and just delve.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's last album was all pop, and she didn't write any of the songs. And WOW, this CD is amazing. No one song is the same, and she gives such a range from Latin, R&amp;B, Rock, Blues, and ballads. I barely recognize her voice. Bottom line is that this is one of the best CD's of 2002.
6304698658|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theatre with my Dad when it was released.  He laughed so hard, I thought he was going to have an asthma attack.  I bought the movie and we watch it every year as a tradition.  I have family members who act like Clark Griswald's relatives, so I can actually relate to the characters in this movie (Scary eh?).<br />There are so many great moments of comedy in this movie, the huge Christmas tree, overcooking the turkey until it explodes, and the Yuppie neighbors that despise Clark with a passion.  Chevy Chase is great as the Dad with the high expectations for a great Christmas and of course, the actual event never quite measures up to his hopes.  And that is what makes it funny. I give this one 5 stars.
B00002E233|1.0|Horrible.  The only good thing about this film is that it looks good.  But the premise is ridiculous.  Stupid story.  Absurd action events.  I can't believe I stayed in the theatre for the whole thing.  Watch out! It's a genetically engineered super-strong genius shark!  Don't waste your time with this one.
B000059XXZ|5.0|What can I say.  I really loved this video.  It will very likely become a classic.  Smiles, Beverly C. Sanders
B00002E233|1.0|Horrible.  The only good thing about this film is that it looks good.  But the premise is ridiculous.  Stupid story.  Absurd action events.  I can't believe I stayed in the theatre for the whole thing.  Watch out! It's a genetically engineered super-strong genius shark!  Don't waste your time with this one.
B00005UDE7|5.0|Dream Theater is a truly phenomenal band, featuring five of the most gifted musicians I know. Their music is complex and challenging, not at all for the faint of heart or musically ignorant. This CD continues their fine tradition of producing stimulating and complicated music, and may even take it a step further. Scenes From A Memory, their previous release, took off in a new direction for the band. It was their rock opera, their Tommy, if you will. This album continues that idea in a  scaled-back approach, while also looking back to the past with a disc of shorter songs (at least for Dream Theater- 3 of the 5 are still over 10 minutes) and a disc containing only one 42-minute song, albeit in 8 movements.<BR> <BR>I will discuss in detail my two favorite works from the album, though I could passionately talk about all of them. The opening track, &quot;The Glass Prison,&quot; is a truly amazing piece, encompassing three distinct sections. After a short, slow introduction centered around a bass harmonic idea, the band launches into a fast-and-furious first section, complete with lightning double-bass work by Mike Portnoy, odd time signatures, and a cool wah-wah riff from John Petrucci. The song throws us a curveball by opening with John P. and Mike singing call-and-response vocals in treated, filtered, almost computer-like voices (at least, I think it is John and Mike; if it isn't them, it is one of them with James LaBrie's voice, also highly treated), before James' normal, strong, smooth voice enters the picture, describing a bleak outlook. The first section really starts to take off when the keyboards enter, Jordan Rudess playing a frantic motive while James backs off a bit, singing little half-note ideas (&quot;Fatal descent; spinning around...&quot;). The second section, unbelievably, only turns up the heat, with the background vocals doing their best James Hetfield impression. James L. continues his amazing singing, jumping from angry, busy action on the low end (&quot;I'll be fearless and thorough to enter this temple of hope.&quot;) to smooth-tone, pleading vocals (&quot;Help me, I can't break out this prison all alone.&quot;) The third section totally switches gears with the drums concentrating on tom-toms, and the guitar playing a beautiful arpeggio part with a pedal upper and a moving bass line. The song ends apruptly with an unnecessary sample of glass breaking.<br />&quot;Misunderstood,&quot; the third track on the first disc, is another highlight. The range of emotion in the song is wide, from complacency and calm to fire and rage to confusion and disbelief. I feel that the song is talking about the undeserved hero-like status that the public places on celebrities. The song opens with a simple but pretty solo guitar part mixing chords with short melodic lines in between. The chords quickly become more complex and jazzy, though, before the keyboards flutter into the mix. The chord progression repeats as James enters. (&quot;Waiting..&quot;) The full band enters on a new idea, which ends up being the chorus (&quot;How can I feel abandoned ...?&quot;) with John M. playing cello (nice touch!) and some shakers from the percussion end. John M. then moves to bass on the bridge (&quot;It challenges the essence of my soul.&quot;), the drums enter sporadically, and there's some nice Mellotron-type work from Jordan. The song then totally explodes, as the guitar feeds back for just a second before the full band comes crashing in on full tilt for another, more angry chorus. The next section would be some sort of development or vamp, and is characterized by a sound I would link to paranoia or dementia. The keyboards dominate here, swirling and swelling in and out, until the harmonized guitar solo enters. The drums sound muffled and filtered, almost electronic. The guitar solo is jagged and discourse, with Petrucci apparently selecting an unique harmony setting on his processor. The bridge then reenters with LaBrie adding some morelayers to it, building even more tension than the first run-through. Portnoy throws in yet another of his impossible time-defying fills before the chorus repeats. The song closes with the paranoia section sans guitar solo fading out after about 2 minutes. The song is unbelievable.<br />The rest of the tracks are still incredible. &quot;Disappear&quot; is probably underrated, it gets better and better with repeated listenings. It is easily the least complex song on the album in terms of playing chops required and technical proficiency, but it is still in 5/4 time, and is slow so requires careful precision and expression. &quot;Blind Faith&quot; has a great verse/chorus discrepancy, as the verses are mellow, while the choruses are powerful. The middle section features a fantastic guitar and keyboard duet along with some astounding drum work. &quot;The Great Debate&quot; has some excellent musical moments and is thought-provoking in its subject matter. The title track on the second disc is loaded with fine moments, some furious, some happy and joyful.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Or so says Ian Gillan to the soundman between songs.  Wow!  That's all I can say.  I used to have this in vinyl, but I hadn't listened to it in over 12 years.  Recently bought this remastered CD and... Wow, I forgot how good this is.  Amazing songs.  Deep Purple was an awesome group of musicians who could jam as well as anyone.  This is a recording they made during three shows in Japan in 1972.  It sounds as good as most studio recordings.  I love the screamin' vocals of Ian Gillan and the blazing drums of Ian Paice, one of the most under-rated drummers in rock.  And of course there's the awesome Ritchie Blackmore on sizzling guitar, Roger Glover on bass, and John Lord on keyboard.  An awesome lineup.  I really can't say enough about how good this recording is.  The second CD contains previously unreleased encore performances.  They don't quite compare with the rest, but are still pretty good.  If you like rock or live performances, get this.
B000002JKA|5.0|Back in 1992, the local rock radio station, 96.5 WCMF, started to play an amazing song called \\"Pull Me Under.\\" I had no idea who played the song the first few times I heard it, as the DJ would not mention the band's name. I came to find out that it was Dream Theater. I had never heard of them before, but was interested to find out more about them. I saw their album, \\"Images And Words,\\" at a local record store, but I was hesitant at first to buy it. What if the rest of the album [was bad]? I knew nothing about this band. Luckily, a good friend of mine had the guts to buy the CD, and he let me borrow it. WOW!!! I was completely blown away by the entire CD, and I immediately picked up my own copy. <br />A few years later, I heard about Dream Theater releasing another album. I was excited, but still a bit cautious: what if \\"Images And Words\\" was just a fluke? (At the time, I was unaware of Dream Theater's existence and experience prior to IAW) I bought the album, and was once again floored, not only by the continued show of musicianship, but also by the sheer mass of music on the disc, over 75 minutes worth! <br />The album is full of titillating musical moments. \\"6:00,\\" the opening song, starts off with a fantastic drum fill cascading down the length of Mike Portnoy's toms,follwed by a frantic beat before the keyboard enters with an awesome, disjointed arpeggio pattern. The song paints a chilling picture of a lonely rogue. James LaBrie's voice is very strong on this song. Many have criticized his voice for being too clean for Dream Theater. I think James' forte is his ability to leap from one vocal quality to another almost effortlessly, and this song is a prime example of his voice on the edge. His voice can be clean or filthy, depending on what the song requires. This was the same quality that made Freddie Mercury a great singer. The coda of this song (\\"So don't cut your losses too soon...\\") is a great change of gears, and makes for a memorable ending. \\"Caught In A Web\\" continues the pace started by \\"6:00,\\" with a fantastic, laboring intro. Kevin Moore plays a sliding keyboard melody over the rest of the band riffing down and dirty. The chorus features some great harmony from James and himself, but the song still does okay live. The instrumental middle section features some stunning bass work from John Myung, playing note for note with John Petrucci, then breaking off to let the keys and guitar duel for a bit, before joining again for the triplet sixteenths finale. \\"Innocence Faded\\" features some masterful guitar work throughout, the keyboards also shine here. The coda of this song is probably the real gem of it. \\"Erotomania\\" is a phenomenal instrumental. I often show the opening guitar riff to my guitar students as a good reason to work towards four-finger dexterity. This is also a great song to introduce people to the band, there's something about it, the same way the \\"YYZ\\" is a good tune to introduce Rush. The guitar solo towards the end of the middle section is a true clinic. \\"Voices\\" is a dark and moody piece. The opening bass line really sets the tone, with atmospheric keyboards and riffing guitar over the top. The guitar solo in this song is again amazing. I have made little mention to this point about Mike Portnoy. The guy is a rock, and when you see him live, he rarely plays something exactly the same way as he did in the studio or previously, but he makes it work; he is astounding! \\"The Silent Man\\" is a nice change of pace. \\"The Mirror\\" is a great song with solid shifts in time and mood. \\"Lie\\" features a straight-up riff, and is probably the most radio-friendly piece of the bunch. \\"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream\\" has a fantastic harmonic-based bass intro. Myung wrote the lyrics as well, you can tell this is his tune. It is a great piece and again a nice change of pace. \\"Scarred\\" opens up with a cool two-hand tapping riff from Myung. It features a solid keyboard solo from Kevin Moore. The last song, \\"Space-Dye Vest,\\" is very cool and moody, but I can't say I adore is as much as some other reviewers here. <br />The entire album is a tour-de-force. Fantastic musicianship and songwriting abound. The band has an amazing talent for painting musical images that few bands today can. Many people complain about the lyrics of DT. I would gladly sacrifice lyric quality for music quality any day. I also agree that Kevin Moore's lyrics were the most interesting of the group, though they were more personalized and hard to understand at times (as in \\"Lie\\": \\"You can tell your step-father I said so\\") Many people say that progressive rock is an oxymoron, and that there is no place for brains in rock and roll. That is just ... nonsense! This is not rock and roll. Elvis Presley is rock and roll. Dream Theater is progressive rock. Love or leave it. But respect it.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This is a must have dvd set if you are a fan of the series.  I never wa a true fan until the series was cancelled, but I caught up quick when all the episodes aired on Mtv.  Since then, I have been a &quot;So-Called&quot; junkie!<BR>I highly recommend this to any teen (girls mostly) out there because nothing comes closer to true life than this series.  I grew up with Angela and actually I finished off with Felicity.<BR>If you were a fan of My So-Called Life, then I recommend Felicity as well.  Angela is High school, while Felicity is college.<BR>However nothing can ever replace a great show such as My So-Called Life with losing and gaining friends, cheesy dances, awkward moments, love and overall life.<BR>This is a winner for anyone.
B0000026CM|5.0|I mean, man, TOTO VII  !!! I have listened to this UNBELIEVABLE album for years and years, and never get tired of it. It is simply PERFECT. This album stands to AOR as Kind of Blue stands to jazz, or as Aerial Boundaries stands for acoustic guitar music! Perfect, perfect, untouchable! Now I listen to jazz mainly, but God, this album! It's such a masterpiece. What? You don't own it? And how do you call your bunch of cds? A collection? AHAI can't stop laughing! BUY IT, life is too short to hear bad music!
B00003CX9Q|4.0|I would have rated this release five stars if only there were some sort of running audio commentary. There really is no excuse not to have this feature these days on a release of a film of this magnitude. The DVD presentation is first-class in every other respect. Although it is novel to be able to hear John Williams perform live with the movie in Dolby Digital 5.1, with accompanying audience reactions to the film as it is played, the original score in 5.1 is much more dynamic. The CG touchup of E.T. running towards his departing spacecraft does nothing but add to the realism of his movements, while detracting nothing from the original. A superfluous bathroom scene is added, and there is only one other scene in which it is clearly a CG E.T. instead of the original. If you are a purist, and you really dig the look of E.T. being pulled along a track in the opening scene, you are in luck, because the second disc has the original unaltered 1982 film release in Dolby Digital 5.1 also. A recommended disc at a reasonable price, especially at Wal-Mart.
0385335482|5.0|It was scary!  I thought this book would be likehearted entertainment because I of course had put all of my financial missteps behind and could laugh at the good days of dodging creditors.  But within ten pages I felt mighty uncomfortable but highly entertained because no matter how bad her mistakes you could always empathize!  Easy read with great characters!  Shopaholic Takes Manhattan wasn't as good but still entertaining (after a couple of chapters you do begin to loss patience, get a grip for crying out loud!)
B000069AUI|5.0|This CD is poignant and moving.  The music, the lyrics, the heartbreaking voice of the lead singer, you will enjoy it from the first song to the last.  Well worth the money spent.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Shaolin Soccer is an extremely funny movie. The story is pefectly combination between Shaolin Kung Fu and Soccer. You can get almost every mood from this movie, it's not only comedy but it could be action and drama in the same one. Shaolin team are funny with outstanding characters each one of them. I'm not sure how US version is going to be but I really loved original version which I have own DVD as well. Stephen did a very good job as a leading actor, director, and screenwriter. I'm highly recommend this movie if you are looking for funny movie, you also will get to know a new Kung Fu action comedian, Stephen Chow. I'm pretty sure that you will like this movie even though you don't like Stephen Chow.
0449227545|2.0|My response to this review is that I disagree with this person's review.  I think that even though California may be earthquake country that there is no reason why anyone could create earthquakes.  The book is not fast but it isn't slow but on the other hand I don't think it is thought out.  The book doesn't really allow you to use your own imagination it tells the story in to much detail so that the readers can't think for themselves.  I don't think that what happened in this book can actually happen in real life because sending something down into the earth to create and earthquake is fictional and just can't happen.  Its not really a good book since it does show how terrible terrorists can be and since these people are from the U.S. it is even worse to know that these people are in the states.  I just think overall this is a bad
B00006NSZ5|5.0|if it werent for tha excess, this cd is incredible. no disrespect to anyone here in particular, but eminem and gangstarr are tha highlights. obie trice is quite promising,tha rest are pretty nice, flick thru them all a few times. # 3 seems to be tha best at tha moment. enjoy this while you can specially tha two disc special!
B00006CXXU|5.0|the single dirrty is okay but the album as a whole is awesome...  She has a variety of excellent songs... definitely worth your money!  go grab a cd!
B00000JLWW|5.0|I have a hard time understanding why some people trash this movie but then again, I remmember how in 1975 the same kind of people also would complain how \\"Jaws\\" was terrible / totally unbelievable, etc. My conclusion is that some people just feel good about themselves by showing desdain for the biggest AND BEST blockbusters.<BR>Titanic is a terrific film, incredibly exciting and very moving. If you really didn't like it I suggest you find another hobby different to going to the movies
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is back and better then ever.  You need to own this cd!
B00005LC4B|5.0|... i am the most diverse movie watcher ever.  Cape Fear is one of two all time favorits.  Cape Fear will appel to you if you like to see a good movie, be scared ,and simply have a great time.  It is awsome.
1556154844|5.0|I am a development manager for a team of programmers and have made this required reading for every programmer who has worked for me. I have not since seen a reference that is just so darn practical and on point when it comes to the art of programming. Every time I reccomend this book to another programmer they always come back to me raving about how it changed their whole outlook on programming. I see a marked improvement in the code and work practices by every programmer that has worked for me after reading this book.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I can't believe how wonderful this album is. I absolutely hate the song &quot;Dirrty&quot; and was afraid the rest of the album would be like that, but it's not. This CD is so completely different from anything Christina Aguilera has ever done. The maturity she shows as a singer and songwriter completely surprised me. There is no trace of a teen pop idol here. The transformation reminds me of Alanis Morisette's makeover from teen Canadian pop singer to angry rock queen. Song after song on this album, my jaws dropped. There are a good ten songs on this CD that could be number one hits, it's that good. And not mindless bubble gum hits, but substantive gems. This CD deserves attention. I hope it gets it.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Has Mark Knopfler every done an album that was not fantastic.  The tradition continues here.  If Mark has a new album Amazon.com can just go ahead and ship it to me on the day it comes out!
B00005JL78|5.0|I find it hard to understand how this movie was only a mild success. This is one of Spielberg's best films and perhaps Cruise's very best. The jetpack and shopping mall chases will go down in film history as truly classic scenes. Whenever anybody complains they don't make movies as they used to, I suggest bringing up Minority Report !
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you take the time to appreciate a truly artistic album, you'll be rewarded with a rare find in popular music; songs that get better.  It's true that the titles of the songs do not seem to stick with you, but if after three listens you do not believe this is a classic record -one of the best in the last decade- then you should go back to the Top 40 and enjoy a happy meal.
0316666343|5.0|To find a book of this incredible magnitude is finding that elusive golden ticket.  I could only read this book after prying it away from my father, who was incredibly enthralled but also incredibly busy, only having completed the first three chapters.  The Lovely Bones is a masterpiece that deserves all the adulation it has received.  This novel offers an explicit view of grief and longing, revenge and justice.  Beautifully captivating, this story, told from heaven by Susie Salmon is gruesome without being gratuitous, moving without being banal.  Reading this forces all of us to face our own mortality and relationships.  If we died at fourteen, what would our heaven be, what regrets would we have, who would miss us and remember us the most.  An ironic twist on the It's a Wonderful Life story, the life, of the survivors, after death shows how one life has a ripple effect that reaches into the depths of our own souls.  Read it if you need to cry, need to dream, need to love, but most of all, if you need to truly live.
1577311523|5.0|The concepts presented in this course (it is not really just a \\"book\\" but a way of practicing toward the achievement of realization) are the most fundamental spiritual revelations in existence.   This is a simplified and lucid presentation of the I AM concept clearly given in the latter Upanishads (called the Vedas) of 5,000 years ago and much more recently (1975) in \\"A Course in Miracles\\".  Most of us are simply not aware that we are, as Dr. Raynor Johnson put it half a century ago, \\"The Imprisoned Splendour.\\"  There are only two ways that this awareness comes and one of them is through daily, grinding, practice.  <BR> <BR>I have been working with the exercises presented by Eckhart Tolle since early June 2002 (this is written on 30 October, 2002) and they have helped to almost eradicate a lifelong depression that I have had since my terrible experience in the Korean War.
B000002GLE|5.0|Sting has been my favourite solo artist for as long as I can remember, and a lot of that is probably due to this record.<BR>Sting set himself up with a fantastic band to record his first `solo' effort in 1985 being `Dream of the Blue Turtles', a good jazz-rock album if a tad laboured (by the way, I'm English and that's how we spell laboured, we have a u in labour). The subsequent tour, from which this album was recorded, was something altogether better. The songs are looser than on Sting's first record, but the playing is still tight and there is an extra energy in all of the songs. For me the highlight is the late Kenny Kirkland's keyboard solo in `When the World is running down...' his playing leaves me in awe.<BR>I like Sting's more recent live release `All this time', but that is no where near as good as this.
B00006V9A0|4.0|\\"Nirvana\\" is a fitting title to a fitting compilation of some of Nirvana's best songs.  (What else could you call it?  \\"Milk It\\"?)<br />The tracklisting is superb:  Starting us off with the last recorded studio song by the whole band, \\"You Know You're Right\\", it kicks off a very strong set of songs with something new for the longtime Nirvana fan.  We then continue chronologically by order of release, starting with \\"About A Girl\\" from \\"Bleach\\" and ending with tracks from the divinely underrated \\"MTV Unplugged in New York\\".<br />However, there are three questionable track choices.  First, What is \\"Been A Son\\" doing on this \\"hits\\" package?  Though it's a decent song - and one of Kurt's most intriguing lyric - it's far from being one of the popular Nirvana entries.  A far more suitable selection from the early years would have been \\"Love Buzz\\", considering it's historical significance - it was the band's first official single, as well as the song that put Nirvana on the map with Sub Pop.<br />Second, why the \\"Unplugged\\" version of \\"All Apologies\\" as opposed to the superior \\"In Utero\\" studio cut?  Though the \\"Unplugged\\" take, like the rest of that album, was sweet and intimate, the \\"In Utero\\" version is all that with an unharnessed edge.<br />Lastly, where is \\"Verse Chorus Verse\\"?  True, it was never on an album or released as a single, but this prized gem from the \\"In Utero\\" sessions was all over the radio at the close of 1993.  Much more a hit than some choices on the compilation, it has been sadly omitted.<br />For the pre-existing Nirvana fan, there are some new treats besides the inclusion of \\"You Know You're Right\\".  \\"Nirvana\\" also touts the re-mixed versions of \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" (from the single) and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" (which was previously unreleased).  Not to mention a brief story on the recording of \\"You Know You're Right\\" and a couple of telling quotes by the band members.<br />For the new Nirvana fan, \\"Nirvana\\" is a qualified starting point.  Although, any album by this quintessential band of its decade is filled with great melodies, lyrics, musicianship, soul, and edge.  <br />Let's hope the upcoming box set holds a bit more for the craving Nirvana fan.
B00006CXXU|5.0|If you don't get this album..this is truly the real her..this is absolutely an amazing and diverse album! Get this album for all your friends and relatives because i'm sure they're love it as well! I can't stop listenin to it! =)
B000059XYL|1.0|I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing...
B00006V9A0|5.0|What more can you say about this band and the music which they produced? Amazing, Ground-breaking, Innovative are all words which are used too often to describe both the band and the impact which they had on modern music. This album has all the best parts of that short spell at the beginning of the 1990's which saw Kurt Cobain elevated to the status of Rock Legend. From the raw vicious intro to \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" to the pained genius of \\"Dumb\\", the album oozes the quality which is missing in the majority of contemporary artists material. From beginning to end this album brings together all that was good about Nirvana. Simply a must-have album. Your collection is not complete without this!!!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Wow!  Beck, crackerjack that he is, has put out a real humdinger here, a total jammin' record!!  Thought you knew him from past records?  Think again!!  &quot;Sea Change&quot; is one powerhouse rocker after another, a non-stop deluge of headbanging mosh that will make you completely forget about Beck's past &quot;trip-hop&quot; phase, which I, unlike everybody else, thought was a waste of pure talent.  However, if you're in to melodic pop with real thrust to it, don't pass up &quot;Sea Change.&quot;  One only wonders what direction young Beck is moving in after this album.<br />TAKE CARE!!
B00005JJX8|5.0|If you have seen this film before, then the chance is you enjoyed it, it's hard not to. It may be slightly predictable - trying to discern the thief isn't all that hard, however, to see Cary Grant and possibly the most beautiful woman of all time (Grace Kelly, if you weren't sure) in a Hitchcock thriller set in the South of France is enthralling.<BR>This film is wonderful; stunning scenery, an exciting plot and I smirk every time I watch the firework scene.<BR>Many Hitchcock fans wouldn't consider this in as high esteem as his other Cary Grant picture of the 1950's or perhaps even `Notorious' which is also a fine film, and possibly they are right. Even so, this film is from a director in his most creative era, Grant being as charming as ever and Kelly as resplendent as always.
B00005JKJA|4.0|David Lynch: screenwriter, director, composer of the wildly eccentric and master of the unfathomable. Although not a devoted member of the Lynch mob, I do admire his unconventional style. In particular I admire his talent for creating freakishly inscrutable characters.<br />\\"Mulholland Drive\\" - saturated with bizarre themes, paradoxical ideas, strange philosophies, enigmatic characters and questionable identities - is true to form for Lynch.<br />In the beginning of the film, several characters are introduced. Some become familiar, while others reappear only once more or never again. In fact, my favorite scene (the coffee shop nightmare) involves two characters with no real significance to the rest of the film.<br />Wait, no real significance? In a Lynch film, tossing aside the seemingly insignificant is foolish, foolish, foolish! Sure he may pull a bluff or two, but in the end almost everything sums up. Miss something and you're lost.<br />Like in the beginning. Note the nonchalant scene - it's brief - after the sock hop but before the limo drive. I missed it the first time, I brushed it aside, but it's the KEY to the entire film.<br />Like everyone, I found the last half hour of \\"Mulholland Drive\\" to be downright baffling. As the credits rolled I watched in glazed confusion. Not many directors have the bravado to leave audiences in such puzzlement and frustration.<BR> <BR>It was a mildly bizarre, but comprehensible, film up until those last 30 minutes. Then all hell breaks loose. Two hours of characterization and plot building get tossed into the air like pieces from an upset chessboard. Relationships are reconnected, personalities flip 180 degrees, settings are repopulated in variant ways and the film unravels like a torn sweater in spin cycle.<br />Or so it would seem. If only I'd paid attention... The second time, after noting the KEY scene, things became clearer. Believe me, it's not impossible to figure out what's going on in this movie.<br />Even tentative souls should watch the film if only for Naomi Watts. Not only is she beautiful, she's an amazing, resonant actress as well. It astounds me that Hollywood has overlooked her for the last 15 years. In the beginning of the film she's bright, cheery and naïve, then about halfway through she begins to offer glimpses into the depth of her character. When the film hits the paradigm shift in the last half hour, Watts delivers one of the most captivating performances of the year. Don't take my word for it: she was nominated three times for her performance, winning twice.<BR> <BR>\\"Mulholland Drive\\" is undoubtedly a movie to see again and again. I've seen it twice and, though I get the general structure, there are still plenty of unsolved mysteries. If that doesn't convince you to purchase it I don't know what will.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I watched this BBC mini series on PBS &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; when it originally aired (I believe it was the very first time they filmed that type of program with exteriors), and I loved it ... even though I had not yet read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot;.  <br />After I read the book I loved the series even more because I could then appreciate how true to the original the production really was.  Unfortunately, back then there were no videos, so I was thrilled when it became available and I could then share it with my family.  The entire family loves this version and we watch it often.  Time just flies by when we are enjoying this scrumptious mix of exquisite acting, lovely costumes, sets and locations ... and the beautiful and witty sound of Jane Austen's style of prose.<br />Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul portray Lizzie and Darcy true to the book, and so did the rest of the enssemble of very talented performers, bringing to life Austen's characters and allowing us to experience the period of time in which she lived. The person who did the casting for the production did a fantastic job!  The actors bring out the character's qualities and flaws with wit, but without downgrading them to the level of caricatures.  <br />I have since also purchased the BBC's version for A&amp;E, featuring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and feel that the two cannot be compared because one was produced as a play (Garvie-Rintoul) and the other one was produced as a movie (Ehle-Firth).  As such, they appeal to two different groups of viewers.  In the same way that some people adore the theater and some are bored to tears by it, some people will love one and be bored by the other.  <br />In the A&amp;E version the character of Mr. Collins is really over the top, too much of a caricature.  The characters of Mr. Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett also could have been better. In my opinion, the casting department had more misses than hits in this production.  Either thator the director and/or supporting actors' portrayals didn't quite hit the mark.    <br />I love watching both versions, although I must confess the 1980 version is the one closest to my heart.  Which version would Jane Austen prefer?  We'll never know, but I think the important thing is that two different types of audience are enjoying her words more than 200 years after she wrote them. :-)
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am a big Christina fan and I've just bought her new album. I have her 3 previous albums all of which i thoroughly enjoyed, all in different ways. However 'Stripped' totally surpassed all my expectations. Even though I have been listening to Christina for months, talking of how different stripped would be to her previous music i am still in shock after listening to the album. 'Christina Aguilera' was pure pop, 'Mi reflejo' was latin-infused, get up and dance beats along with beautiful ballads, 'My kind of christmas' showed off Christinas voice to its utmost but 'Stripped' is all of these and yet none-it is a complete departure from her previous 'image'. This record is going to be huge! Christina is not just a talented and amazing vocalist-she is a dancer, a singer, a song writer and ultimately a fantastic all round artist. You must buy stripped!
068484267X|5.0|I think alot about this book.  I can relate to it in a lot of ways.  No one just is given everything and for those who are this book is a wonderful source of what reality really is.  Life is tough and it takes a strong and determined person to make it through the worse.  However I'm a firm believer that God never lays upon you tasks that you can't over come or live through.  This young man, Frank McCourt, was all of the above and so much more.  My heart goes out to him, his family and his lost loved ones.  This book was by far the best book I've ever read.  Frank McCourt... thank you for sharing your story with us.
B000067CPX|5.0|As the godfathers of the rap/metal and funky punk rock, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have expanded their musical capabilities with each album they have so masterfully crafted.  With 'By The Way', they have reverted to a more lay-back harmonizing pop approach.  Like true musicians, the RHCP are not handicapped and held down by one genre and style.  If it wasn't for their talent of creativity, would people still know who they were 20 year later?<br />Anthony Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, and Chad Smith have all grown and matured musically since the release of their first album together, 'Mother's Milk'.  This 1989 release included covers of Stevie Wonder(Higher Ground) and Jimi Hendrix(Fire).  In 1991, 'Bloodsugarsexmagik'(best RHCP album) was introduced to mainstream and became a huge success with hits like \\"Under The Bridge\\" and \\"Give It Away\\".  The next time this same RHCP would be together was on the 1999 'Californicatoin'.  This hallmark of their career proved that they were not dead.  Their music has taken a complete turn from the previous albums, and it further degresses on the latest release.  Here's a rundown on the tracklist:<br />1.  By The Way - Perfect blend of \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" school Chili Peppers.  The verse has the same funky slap bass, in your face punk rap of the early RHCP albums.  The melody and harmony of the chorus brings in the influence of 'Californication'.  Definitely the 'hardest' song on the album.<br />2.  Universally Speaking - Chad Smith pounds away on the snare as this song is a more relaxed and laid back track.  Flea and Frusciante's background vocals harmonize perfectly with Kiedis' heart-felt singing.<br />3.  This Is The Place - Flea's bassline runs throughout the song like a train through a tunnel.  Frusciante's guitar compliments every note emotionally created by this phenomenal track.<br />4.  Dosed - Frusciante's harp-like guitar picking emphasizes the romantic theme of this beautiful love song.<br />5.  Don't Forget Me - Flea's bass strumming creates a melancholy mood for this deep and sorrowful song.<br />6.  The Zephyr Song - Kiedis' exhibits a serene and sincere performance, backed by the vocal of his fellow bandmembers.  The harmony is yet again what separates it apart from all other RHCP albums.<br />7.  Can't Stop - Truly the best song on the CD.  It brings back the trademark funky raps but this time it is filled with clean lyrics and a supporting vocal cast.  <br />8.  I Could Die For You - Soft, and lovely ballad.<br />9.  Midnight - Orchestrated strings intro. Definitely a change for the RHCP, but excellent song.<br />10. Throw Away Your Television - Flea and Chad show their chemistry of bass and drums in this percussive jam.<br />11-12. Cabron/Tear - (Listen to them) very hard to recognize the RHCP if not for Kiedis' distinct voice.<br />13. On Mercury - This song flashes back to the \\"ska\\" era with No Doubt and the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.<br />14. Minor Thing - Another classic Chili Peppers with an infectious rap line.<br />15-16. Warm Tape/Minor Queen - These 2 concluding tracks make us wonder what direction the RHCP will take in the future.  <br />In conclusion, this album is highly recommended to all the true fans of the RHCP or anyone who likes rock/alternative music.
B000000XCH|5.0|CCR had always been one of those bands I meant to listen to more.  I'd heard all their big hits, and I was ready to move into the actual albums.  So I was digging through a local thrift store in search of LPs and I discovered a beat-up copy of COSMO'S FACTORY on vinyl.  I immediately purchased it and went home to listen.  Naturally, I loved it.  This could probably serve as the Beginner's Guide To CCR, due to the wealth of familiar songs.  Sure, everyone in the Western hemisphere knows the hits (&quot;Up Around the Bend,&quot; &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door,&quot; etc.) but it's one song which sticks out in my mind.  &quot;Ramble Tamble&quot; kicks serious behind.  The extended jam in the song's midsection will have you begging for more.  It instantly became one of my favorite CCR songs.  Yet it has never appeared on any Greatest Hits or 20th Century Millennium collections.  Even if you buy this simply for &quot;Ramble Tamble,&quot; you'll be getting your money's worth.  After listening to COSMO'S FACTORY, the only question I have is which CCR album to pick up next.
0684833395|5.0|On the one hand, Catch-22 may be beating a dead horse under the circumstances that it is trying to convince the reader that not all soldiers serving during WW2 were perfect and that many were trying to escape their duty, but on the no-so-literal side, the book is an amazing insight into the twisted rules of most establishments and organizations, notably and especially those which are \\"American\\".<br />At a surface glance, Catch-22 appears to be about one Captain Yossarian, a navigator serving in Italy during World War 2 who is constantly trying to find ways to get out of combat and return home due to the fact that his commanding officer, Colonel Cathcart, is constantly raising the number of required bombing missions for each pilot. The context of the story follows Yossarian's various crazy attempts to escape the hellhole he is trapped in, as well as the insane antics of the other soldiers in his squadron and the numerous backstabbings and alliances that occur. By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll be questioning if there is even one sane man in the entire squadron.<br />That is the surface look. When you look underneath that, Heller has taken all the loopholes and injustices of the military and served them up for any somewhat intelligent person to see and therefore to use, in order that they won't get themselves caught up in a net of contradictions and lies, essentially falling into the all American trap of joining the military. (Little did Heller know how many young men would do just that less than 20 years later in Vietnam.)<br />However, that is still not all. Under this second skin of the military lies an even deeper message that goes even beyond how distrustful and wicked the military can be, and that is the horrid truth that establishments all across the globe are using the same twisted procedures and insanely irrational rules to keep those who are a part of it in check. The fact that there is not only one message hidden under the surface of theplot, but an even deeper one embedded in that is truly genius, and I do not use that word lightly.<br />With the universal truth about establishments and their catch-22's (essentially a lose-lose situation), there are also many other messages in tow throughout the novel about the morality, decency, and existence of man. The chapter titled \\"Nately's Old Man\\" serves up a decent argument about war and the ultimate future of America and hereby all nations, and the chilling chapter \\"Snowden\\" brings the entire existence of man into question in a disturbing scene taking place during the death of a soldier on board a plane. Some may view Catch-22 as an irrelevant novel to anyone who wasn't alive in the 1950's due to its WW2 theme and overall plot, but deep down inside, theire is a truth to this novel which has stood the test of time. No true reader of literature would dare pass this up.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Well, she been gone a minute, but she's finally back. This album is definately not a disappointment. It's a solid album...but it ain't quite perfect. My biggest complaint is the lack of uptempo tracks. The first single, &quot;Dirrty&quot;, is most definately not a reflection of the album as a whole. It's probably the only track of it's kind on the LP...and that might be good or bad, depending on how u feel about the song. The stand-out tracks on this album are definately &quot;Dirrty&quot;, &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot;, &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Fighter&quot;, and &quot;Impossible&quot;. I also got a soft spot for &quot;Infatuation&quot;, being that I'm Boricua myself (The song is about a Boricua a.k.a. her ex). Most of the songs I mentioned are uptempos, which explains why I'm not usually feelin' albums with too many ballads. &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot; is also another uptempo on the LP. It's just one example of how Xtina has grown...the song is actually about one night stands and booty calls...no more genies in bottles. Xtina also gets to flex her creative muscles...she helped produce and write almost the whole album. The album also covers a wide range of musical genres...there's some Rock, RnB, and Pop all rolled into one. If u want one example of how diverse this album is, give &quot;Makeover&quot; a listen. Definately not what peeps are used to hearing from Xtina. &quot;I'm OK&quot; is a powerful song about Xtina's past and will definately get your attention. I definately would give this album a chance if I were y'all.
0380977788|5.0|The world is full of alternate universes; worlds of the insane, worlds of the dying, worlds of the dead, and the worlds on the other side of those things that seem nondescript. There are windows and wardrobes and mirrors and wells and hallways, and then there are doors that open with strange and rusted keys...and who can resist such an opening?<br />Certainly not Coraline. Her parents are disracted as only parents can be. They buy her clothes that must be 'grown into' as parents often do. They cook \\"recipies\\" instead of normal food. Other grownups can't even pronounce her name, let alone understand why she wants to wear violently colored gloves...<br />Welcome to Coraline's odd world, where bravery is measured in facing a terror not once, but twice, and Coraline must learn that the one thing that she cannot trade for her heart's desire is her heart.<br />This is an amazing, astounding book; creepy enough to hold the interest of kids, spooky enough to startle adults. The story is multi-tiered in such a way that no matter what your age or maturity level, you'll always remember what you read.
B00006JIAF|5.0|Just listen to it and decide for yourself,<BR>loved it
0792845730|4.0|So we have a scene where a product is being demonstrated for the board of a big company.  You have the suck-up, who has a professional smile on his face no matter what.  You have the plotter looking for his chance to move up in the organization.  And then there's the \\"gofer\\", who feels important because he's chosen to help with the demonstration.  Only the product is a prototype for a mechanical cop.  Unfortunately for the gofer, the product has a bug in it, and fills the guy full of bullets in a very graphic display of violence.  This, folks, is hilarious stuff! At least it was meant to be.<br />The above scene is just the best in a movie full of sly social commentary disguised as an action flick.  Coming out a few years before computer animation, the movie had to use stop-action filming to get the robot to work, but they did a lot with the technology of the time.  They were rewarded with lots of box-office, and the notoriety of having made a sci-fi classic.<br />I find the movie especially rewarding today, when we are hearing scandal after scandal of corporate executives getting busted for mismanaging the money they were put in charge of handling.  Millions of people have had their lives altered negatively by these scum, who only acted to promote their egos and careers.  To see them portrayed as what they are, and then getting blasted away shows that this was a movie ahead of it's time.  If you haven't seen it in awhile, catch it with this angle in mind.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I couldn't believe how great this cd was...Having never really liked Christina until actually a few months ago, I just recently started listening to her firt 3 cds...Don't get me wrong, they're all good, but the first one was weak...Not because of her, her voice was magnificent and powerful-- but the music itself. I listened to this cd today, and I was actually brought to tears especially during &quot;I'm OK&quot;..It's so great that she has finally come out of her shell and is happy and able to express herself. I definitely recommed this!!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|Man Please buy the 8 Mile soundtrack dawg. This album has all new eminem songs. Also new to shady records, 50 Cent also has a couple nice tracks. Nas and Jayz also have new tracks on this joint. But man, the best track is lose yourself. The next 3 best tracks on the album are Love Me, Rap Game, and 8 Mile. Also the bonus material is the stuff. Man im like the biggest fan of eminem. I truly recommend this album to anyone who has a style for music.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Okay. I'll dispense with a review of the film, because most of us (I hope) already agree that this is simply a classic.<br />Let me begin by simply saying I'm SO happy Warner's have chosen to produce a special edition DVD to mark the 50th anniversary of the film. It's one of those releases that reminds you just how superior the potential of the DVD format is.<br />Right, the extras: They're good. In fact, they're great. The new interview material is so nice to see, especially seeing as most of the people who worked on the film are passed away or very old. The only person missing I would have liked to see was Rita Morena (Zelda Zanders), but everyone else is there, including archive footage of the much-missed Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen. <br />I should warn you that the commentary is not a screen-specific commentary, but one of those disappointing audio commentaries comprising audio interviews. Still, it's a minor quibble.<br />The transfer and the sound quality a very evry nice indeed, although I've been watching this film for so long, I almost wish it wasn't in 5.1! I got used to the Mono. Oh, and just in case you might think this Fullscreen presentation is poor, as some other reviewers seem to think, then please know that this film was not made in widescreen. Cinemascope and the other wide formats were not introduced until the year after this film was shot.<br />All the other extras are evry interesting, including the feature length documentary on Arthur Freed and the MGM years. It's very interesting, and very nostalgic.<br />Oh, look. Just buy it! You'll be happy with it, I'm sure. I just hope Warners and the others continue to go back to the classics in their vaults and give them this kind of treatment, if for nothing more than posterity.<br />(5 stars)
0880389052|5.0|I don't want to spoil it just trust me and READ IT!
B00006CXXU|5.0|this album is sound totally different from her debut one.It is a good evolution for our 'genie from the bottle'.It is worthy to purchase this album.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Few bands can pull off an artful and commercial debut on a major label, but with the release of their self-titled new album, 30 Seconds to Mars have proven themselves as a unique, yet bludgeoning force to be reckoned with.  <br />From the beginning hit of the first track &quot;Capricorn,&quot; the listener's interest is firmly grasped by a unique blend of hard rock and electronics with no intention of being let go.  Directly afterward comes the sonic assault known as &quot;Edge of the Earth.&quot;  This song showcases vocalist Jared Leto's incredible talent as a singer and musician through his use of range and harmony.  Other high points of the album include &quot;The Mission&quot; (a seemingly punk-influenced hard driving track which both maintains and develops the band's electronic sensibility), and the breathtakingly majestic &quot;Oblivion.&quot;<br />My only problem with this album is that the lyrics get almost self-indulgently vague at times, but are nevertheless necessary in blending with the band's otherworldly sound.
0380977273|5.0|Out of all of Ray Bradbury's prodigious gifts, perhaps none is greater than his ability to capture the true essence of childhood in a timeless manner.  While his most prolific period is now four decades past, Bradbury's descriptions of the hopes and fears of childhood still strike a powerful chord; in particular, he is able to capture the fears of childhood from an adult's perspective, without in any way minimizing them.<br />In \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" the reader is treated the pinnacle of Bradbury's writings on childhood.  In it, he explores the most fundamental desire, and conversely, the most fundamental fear of childhood: growing older.  Who among us wouldn't have leapt at the opportunity to be \\"grown up\\" at the snap of our fingers, but what about the consequences?  Here, Bradbury uses the metaphor of a carnival that preys upon the fears of growing older, quite literally, in order to sustain itself.<br />The two main characters, Will in Jim, are fourteen, and in that awkward time that is not quite adulthood but not quite childhood either.  They are torn between the desire to plunge into adult life, even as they cling to the safety of childhood.  In this regard they are no different from any other child, the difference is that the carnival, and it's mysterious merry-go-round make it possible for them to do something about this situation.  Juxtaposing their dilemma is Will's father, who married and had Will relatively late and life, and feels his age all the more as a result of his young son.<br />\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a clever, spooky story, perfect for Halloween time.  Bradbury is a master of descriptive writing, and no one sets a mood better than he does.  More than that, tough, this is a novel about coming of age, about the value of youth, but also about appreciating where you are and what you have achieved.  It is heartfelt and sincere in an age where far too many novels use cynicism as a mask for a lack of ideas.  For that reason alone, this is a novel that is well worth reading.<br />Enjoy!
0140067477|3.0|Benjamin Hoff made many of the concepts of Taoism simple for me as an American.  On page 4, the author explains the concept of _Tao_ and writes, \\"...the harmony that naturally existed between heaven and earth could be found by anyone at any time...earth was in essence a reflection of heaven, run by the same laws-not by the laws of men.  These laws affected not only the spinning of distant planets, but also the activities of birds in the forest and fish in the sea.  According to Lao-tse, the more man interfered with the natural balance produced and governed by universal laws, the further away the harmony retreated into the distance.  The more forcing, the more trouble.\\"  Even from my own Judeo-Christian tradition, it certainly makes sense to me to not fight against these universal laws (although I would disagree with a Taoist what these laws are and how these laws are learned).  He then went on to explain that according to Taoism, these laws must be experienced rather than taught academically.<br />Using Winnie the Pooh (_P'u_?) as an example, the author goes on to explain the concept of _P'u_: \\"natural, simple, plain, honest.\\"  Throughout the dialog of this book, Pooh is used as a positive example of Taoist virtues and other characters (Tigger, the Owl, Rabbit, etc.) reflect the failures of other philosophies.  Benjamin Hoff describes a character named \\"Bisy Backson\\" that hurries around fighting against the _Tao_. The author writes, \\"Rabbit didn't know what a Backson was in spite of the fact he is one.\\" In several places, the author seems needlessly judgmental. Benjamin Hoff writes, \\"Looking back a few years, we see that the first Bisy Backsons in this part of the world, the Puritans, practically worked themselves to death in the fields without getting much of anything in return for their efforts.\\" In places, I found myself offended when the author disparaged cultures other than the Taoists.
0375507507|5.0|Alexandra Fuller's book is a must-read for anyone who loves Southern Africa and its contradictions. This book is written with so much passion, and yet control. It evokes the smells, sounds, sense of an Africa I experienced growing up at the same time and age in the 70's in South Africa. It is a book I will reccommend to all my compatriots who, as a result of Life's twists and turns, might find themselves living on a different continent and yet will always call Southern Africa home. Her brilliant observations, brutally honest writing and sense of humour made me savour each page. Hopefully this is just the first of many books. She has won an instant fan.

B00006NSZ5|4.0|Okay, heres all my shiz..even tho 8 mile aint out yet i was able to see a secret sneak peak at it by winning tickets (??aint telling how??).  But anywho..Eminem is the best in this movie!  I def. think ya'll should go see it.  OK, now for the soundtrack, I love all of it..a few songs aint my fave but thats ok.  Yes 4 stars is what i rate it!
6305127638|2.0|I can put Insurrection that that spot.  This one wasn't very good either.  They destroyed the borg.  And I ain't talking about blowing up one cube.  The great thing about the borg was there single mindedness.  Now, they, like so much of Trek are just wishy-washy.  The film starts off with some action, but this ends quickly.  With it goes any thought of further pleasure from this film.  Cochrane is not the character he has been established to be.  And, as much as I love Alfrie Woodard, she was stealing Beverly's line.  Beverly should have been the one character to really confront Picard.  Instead, she has probably the most \\"out of character\\" line in the movie.  I did like Alice Krige as the borg queen, but the borg queen should never have been created.  If they have time travel, why not go back to the past before they get to earth?  Why not just send 100 borg cubes?  Because Rick Berman doesn't care, and many Trek fans would rather have [junk] than lose it all.  I LOVE Star Trek, but if it can't get better, just cancel it.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Everyone has said it already. The bizzare atmosphere and characters, the mind blowing stunt work, the raw edge thrill of realism that only a low budget can supply... this film is fantastic.<br />I cannot watch many movies over and over, but this one is a winner. Everytime I see it, the better it gets!<br />As a consequence this is my favourite movie of all. Many other greats of cinema are in my top ten, but this beats my Hitchcock and Kubrick leanings by a mile...<br />Basically, don't hesitate... buy this DVD, it is a must have...
0316666343|5.0|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold has gotten an extraordinary amount of press, promotion and talk over the past few months.  I was a bit hesitant to give into popular opinion and spend money on a hardcover book from an author I wasn't familiar with, but I finally did. WOW - it was worth it.<br />I found this unusual story (told from the perspective of the murdered victim) to be so timely this year with the numerous child murders we have been witness too.  During the entire novel, I kept thinking that all young kidnapped and murdered children in this country are reaching out and trying to tell us what happened to them in those last terrifying hours of their lives.  It broke my heart and I struggled with those emotions long after I finished this book.<br />It's a real testament to the power of love and family and that a child's love is always with you.  It also gives the hope (no matter what your beliefs are) that one day you go on to a better place.  <br />I really enjoyed &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; and think that it's a read that will speak to me for a long time.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This is, by far, the best cd that I am yet to lay my hands on. The pure soulfullness that radiates from every song fills one with a sense of pain and sentiment, yet also with the feeling that you, too, have experienced what Alanis tells of, and that comes also with a sense of belonging.<BR>   I would reccomend this cd to anyone, Alanis fan or not, though it does require a certain &quot;taste&quot; to be fully appreciated. <BR>   The only two songs that i could do without are &quot;The Couch&quot; and &quot;So Pure.&quot; They are not her best. &quot;The Couch&quot; is more free-versed than any other song on the album, without rhyme or chorus. I only give it a small thumbs-up because it is about her father, and, in my opinion, shows her forgiveness to him as transitioned from &quot;Perfect&quot; off of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. And &quot;So Pure&quot; sounds a lot like the newest Alanis material, standing out from the rest of the songs.
B00000ILBK|1.0|What else needs to be said.  It was truly boring.  I was less bored with The Motion Picture.  I was even less bored with The Final Frontier.  I love Star Trek.  I want Star Trek to be worth watching, but there hasn't been really good Trek since TNG 4th season.  That is where it started to go down.  In this movie, we are treated to cheesy character, shallow plot, really bad effects, slow music, and &quot;bad&quot; humor.  If the humor was really funny, like Voyage Home, it might have been better.  Unfortunately, the characters created in the TNG series died at the end of that series.  They have never been the same in the movies.  They didn't develop into the people they are now. They just became these people.  I don't like them.  I hope Nemesis will improve, at the very least, the story telling.  The only good thing I can say about this one is that there isn't any time travel.
B00005JL9A|3.0|'Battle Royale' is one of those movies that you watch and have trouble forming an opinion on.  The story has a group of unruly Japanese schoolchildren sent to a deserted island where they are instructed to kill each other (the survivor being the champion and the only one able to escape the island) or be killed in the Battle Royale scheme, an aim by the government to cut down on teenage violence.  Of course, there's a central irony here as well as a certain degree of satire on extremist measures to an extreme problem and on the generation gap.  Unusually though it's such satire that bogs the movie down.  As a simple horror/action story this is gripping, entertaining stuff, but when it's taking itself seriously the movie's limitations become all too apparent.  For example, the sympathy is firmly ladled on the innocent children, giving no outside perspective whatsoever and handing out small inner narratives that are too short to really emote.<br />The violence is at first shocking, and certainly effective at getting its point across, although rather than setting this up as satire the filmmakers should just admit that this is really an excuse to try and make the audience react more strongly to the heavily stylised violence.  Perhaps it isn't fair to highlight this fact to such an extent, although it is true that is the film's only really big disappointment.  Apart from some bad characterisation of the supporting players where it is never really explained why some people kill and others choose not to, this is a very good movie indeed.  The main characters are very good indeed, and it would have been a wise choice to focuse exclusively on these as they are actually drawn out very well.  There's also a good bit of humour here, something that works surprisingly well in juxtaposition to so much blood.  For instance, there is the jovial tone of the TV presenter as she exlains to the schoolchildren about weaponry and slaughter, as well as a group of terminally happy popular girls that are ultimately self-destructive.<br />Basically this is a movie of mixed parts - whilst some characters are highly interesting, others are far too dull, and if the beginning is shocking, the ending is uninspired.  I know people who think this is an immensely original movie, although personally it reminded me too much of the flawed but superior 'Series 7: The Contenders'.  However, 'Battle Royale' is further proof that the intertanational market can more than hold its own alongside its bigger Hollywood competitors.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I really loved Monsters Inc.  I thought it was smart, charming and really exceptional.  As a lover of many animated films (including most of the Disney Classics) I was thrilled to see the popularity of films like Monsters Inc. / Shrek / etc.<br />I think Pixar makes the most visually appealing movies in the market.  Their work on the &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; movies really knocked my socks off and I was so pleased with Monsters Inc.  <br />John Goodmans' vocal performance was top rate.  Great movie for the entire family - Kids adore it and parents will have a great time too!
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album, with the newly released track \\"You Know You're Right\\", is a bonus for all Nirvana fans who thought that there would be no additional song releases after Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. The CD provides an excellent sound byte of the band's music with tracks selections from Bleach to Unplugged. Highlights include \\"Dumb\\", \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", \\"Rape Me\\", \\"About a Girl\\", \\"All Apologies\\", and \\"You Know You're Right\\", a song that clearly illustrates in its dark guitar intro and anguished vocals, both the intense creativity and depression encompassing Cobain before his suicide. Moreover, Nirvana is an album that shows the band's broad range, and progression through musical styles, from the raging guitar melodies in Bleach to the growing introspection found on In Utero. This is a fine collection of songs from a band that truly revolutionized rock music.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I was never a big fan of Christina Aguilera, until i heard the song \\"Cruz.\\" The entire album is amazing and I would have given it 5 stars, if not for the horrendously annoying track \\"Dirrty\\"<br />1. Stripped Intro-a nice intro to the album. Sets the tone for things to come. 4/5<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down-featuring Lil' Kim. not a bad track, a little to hip-hoppy for the rest of the cd. 4/5<BR>3. Walk Away-a nice ballad, but the song it leads into is even better. 4/5<BR>4. Fighter-one of the album's standout tracks...absolutely incredible. 5/5<BR>5. Primer Amore Interlude-just some Spanish guitar, not much to say. 4/5<BR>6. Infatuation-the first song to be heard from the album. Spanish flavored with a nice beat, it just doesnt seem to have meaning. 3/5<BR>7. Love's Embrace Interlude-a nice intro...mellow and calm. 4/5<BR>8. Loving Me 4 Me-a nice ballad, not a particulary strong track. 3/5<BR>9. Impossible-feautres Alicia Keys. Very Jazzy and awesome. 5/5<BR>10. Underappreciated-about her breakout with Jorge Santos. I give it a 4/5 because it reveals a lot about the end of their relationship.<BR>11. Beautiful-one of the best ballads I have heard in a VERY long time. Absolutely a classic song. 5/5<BR>12. Make Over-Christina Rox. Channeling Hole on this track, Christina transforms herself into a Courtney Love type character. 4/5<BR>13. Cruz-one of the best tracks on the album. 5/5<BR>14. Soar-soulful and gospelish, this song is great, but seems like a Whitney Houston leftover. 4/5<BR>15. Get Mine, Get Yours-about casual sex. Not a bad song in general. 3/5<BR>16. Dirrty-f/ Redman. A good club track, but surprisingly annoying after while and ever so corny. 3/5<BR>17. Stripped (Part II)-the continuation of the intro. 5/5<BR>18. The Voice Within-a standardized ballad. Shows off Christina's vocals. 4/5<BR>19. I'm Ok- the most introspective song on the album. Truly touching. 5/5<BR>20. Keep On Singing my Song-a mellowed out track. Really nice. 4/5<br />The only thing I wish shehad done is combined the \\"Stripped's\\" into one song.
B00005JL9A|3.0|'Battle Royale' is one of those movies that you watch and have trouble forming an opinion on.  The story has a group of unruly Japanese schoolchildren sent to a deserted island where they are instructed to kill each other (the survivor being the champion and the only one able to escape the island) or be killed in the Battle Royale scheme, an aim by the government to cut down on teenage violence.  Of course, there's a central irony here as well as a certain degree of satire on extremist measures to an extreme problem and on the generation gap.  Unusually though it's such satire that bogs the movie down.  As a simple horror/action story this is gripping, entertaining stuff, but when it's taking itself seriously the movie's limitations become all too apparent.  For example, the sympathy is firmly ladled on the innocent children, giving no outside perspective whatsoever and handing out small inner narratives that are too short to really emote.<br />The violence is at first shocking, and certainly effective at getting its point across, although rather than setting this up as satire the filmmakers should just admit that this is really an excuse to try and make the audience react more strongly to the heavily stylised violence.  Perhaps it isn't fair to highlight this fact to such an extent, although it is true that is the film's only really big disappointment.  Apart from some bad characterisation of the supporting players where it is never really explained why some people kill and others choose not to, this is a very good movie indeed.  The main characters are very good indeed, and it would have been a wise choice to focuse exclusively on these as they are actually drawn out very well.  There's also a good bit of humour here, something that works surprisingly well in juxtaposition to so much blood.  For instance, there is the jovial tone of the TV presenter as she exlains to the schoolchildren about weaponry and slaughter, as well as a group of terminally happy popular girls that are ultimately self-destructive.<br />Basically this is a movie of mixed parts - whilst some characters are highly interesting, others are far too dull, and if the beginning is shocking, the ending is uninspired.  I know people who think this is an immensely original movie, although personally it reminded me too much of the flawed but superior 'Series 7: The Contenders'.  However, 'Battle Royale' is further proof that the intertanational market can more than hold its own alongside its bigger Hollywood competitors.
B00006CXXU|5.0|all i have to say is that this is an amazing work of music.  walk away has to be the best song on this cd.  she has grown into a mature woman.  her clad image is how she deals with life.  this is her, and with this cd, she is at her best.  her superb voice never fails to amaze me.  go christina, best wishes to a young artist with so much pure, rare talent.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|this is a really good compilation of music from the movie, every track has its own vibe...buy it
B00006CXXU|5.0|1. Stripped part 1: This is an intro to the album. You hear voices of EmineM, Fred Durst, Britney Spears and more. It's a good intro for the album. <BR>2. Can't Hold US Down: I think this is the best song on the album. It is like an anthem for women. It's about double standards. It features Lil' Kim, but I don't really like her part, but she only sings 2 or 3 lines, so that's aight. <BR>3. Walk Away: This is a beautiful ballad. The beginning is a bit boring, but when you get into the song it's amazing. <BR>4. Fighter: this is a great song and it features Dave Navaro. It is real rocky. It's about backstabbing friends and how that made Christina so much stronger. You wouldn't expect this song from Christina, but I really love it. <BR>5. Primor Amor Interlude: here Christina talks about a latin lover that stole her heart. She does this in Spanish. Basically it tells you what Infatuation is about. <BR>6. Infatuation: This song is about how her mother used to warn her about these latin lovers, but Christina can't help to fall for one. The song has a Latin feeling to it. It's an amazing song. I really hope that this will be a single. <BR>7. Loving me 4 me interlude: I think the should have left this interlude, but it's aight. <BR>8. Loving me 4 me: I'm not a real fan of this song, it's aight as background music, but it's a bit boring. In this song Christina gives you the readons why she's inlove with a guy. <BR>9. Impossible: beautiful song. It was written by Alicia keys and you can really hear that. <BR>10. Underappreciated: love this song. It's about how Christina feels underappreciated by her boyfriend. <BR>11. Beautiful: this is a good ballad and it's also her new single. It really shows Christina's vocal abilities. She sings that she's beautiful no matter what everyone says. <BR>12. Make Over: Love the song. It sounds a bit like the Sugababes. It's about that she doesn't need that someone tries to make her over. <BR>13. Cruz: Beautiful ballad. It's about that she's leaving to someplace and just leaves everything behind. <BR>14. Soar: great song, nothing to tell about. <BR>15. Get Mine, Get Yours: I really love this song. It's about having sex with a guy without any strings attached. <BR>16. Dirrty: everybody knows this song, because it's her first single. It doesn't really fit in the album, but it's a great song anyway. <BR>17. Stripped part 2: it takes of where stripped part 1 ended. <BR>18. The Voice within': this is my favourite ballad, it's so beautiful. It's about that you have to trust the voice within. <BR>19. I'm OK: This song is about her abusive father, the lyrics are great, but the song isn't that great. <BR>20. Keep on singing my song: again a beautiful ballad, it's about that Christina keeps on singing no matter what.
B00005K9LK|4.0|In 1982 Judas Priest came out with what is widely considered theris finest album, Screaming for Vengeance. Sporting dueling guitar solos from Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing and high-pitched screams from the mighty Rob Halford, Screaming ushered in a new Priest, even heavier and faster than before. However, the music began to sound almost formulated to a point, and this formula produces a few excess tracks. The album kicks off with \\"the Hellion/Electric Eye\\" which is easioy one of the best songs the band has ever recorded with its unique vocal styles and killer guitars. Next comes \\"Riding on the Wind\\" which kicks off with a cool drum solo and doesn't let you go til the end some 3 minutes later. At this point, however, the heavy formula starts to go off treack, with average treacks like Bloodstone and Take These Chains. The slower Pain and Pleasure is just plain weird. Howevewr, the album gets back on track with the driving title track, which moves right along into You've Got Another Thing Coming\\", the album's big hit. \\"Fever\\" is a slower number, though its certainly worth a listen. The fast/heavy formula seen on this most of the album returns for \\"Devil's Child\\" the awesome album closer.<br />Screaming delivers instrumentally and vocally(thanks to Mr. Halford's godly pipes), but continues on the general decline of Halford's ability as a lyricist. Also, Ian Hill's bass becomes less and less noticeable and his lines simpler and simpler, and this album is not exception to this. Judas Priest would use the formula seen on Screaming with sluightly better results on their next album, Defenders of the Faith. Still, Screaming stands as one of the most recognizable Priest releases and therefore is well suiter for any newcomer to the band.

B00006V9A0|5.0|I have been a fan of Nirvana for 3 years and I am just pleased to see a new release from them. This cd is great for new fans and I think You Know You're Right is one of Kurt's greatest songs. The remastering helps the pre-Nevermind material best and helps with the other songs yet not quite as noticable though. A great cd for new fans interested in Nirvana.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Outstanding story, magnificent cinematography.<BR>Wheteher your first viewing or a revisit, worth the time!
B00005K9LM|5.0|Coming on the heels of 1982's successful Screaming for Vengeance, Judas Priest hoped their next release, Defenders of the Faith(1984), would be their commercial breakthrough. However that was not to be, and soon the flavor of heavy metal epitomized by Priest would be swept away by thrash and hair(ugh!) metal.<br />As for Defenders itself, musically they kept to their heavy metal roots and \\"Screaming\\" formula with about the same success. \\"Freewheel Burning\\" \\"Rock Hard, Ride Free\\" \\"The Sentinel\\" \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"Some Heads are Gonna Roll\\" are all scorching metal tracks, and truly the best ones on the album. \\"Night Comes Down\\" is a slow, ballady, pop-rock song that's rather average overall, while \\"Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\\" goes way over the top and falls flat, as do the rather sick lyrics of \\"Eat Me Alive\\". While Rob Halford delivers his normally awesome vocals, his lyric-writing continues to slide into the same pattern of \\"We are Judas Priest. We are the Metal Gods. We are the best band in the whole world\\" over and over, which gets kind of annoying on Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\\"(the most obvious example).<br />Overall, Defenders is inconsistent, but the plusses outweigh the cons and this one is highly recommended to someone looking for more 80s Priest(pre-Turbo, that is...then again I like to think they never made Turbo). The heavier sections of the album will not disappoint.
B00006LWSF|5.0|This isn't any ordinary soundtrack with just a couple decent songs you have heard before. This soundtrack ROCKS. With songs from Eminem (Lose Yoiurself, 8 Mile, Run Rabbit Run), Jay Z (8 Miles and Runnin), 50 Cent (Wanksta,Places To Go),etc, this soundtrack is a MUST HAVE. U GOTTA GET IT
0393316041|4.0|This is a fine book if you are looking for something light. The style is witty and entertaining.<br />Feynman is a curious character, who loves to discover and experiment, and this nature of his provides for much adventure.<br />The book is also motivating at times.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Just when we thought nothing could top last year's deluxe edition of SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Disney have outdone themselves.  This sparkling new 2-disc of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has been well worth the wait, and features an impressive print.<br />The first disc features three (count 'em) three versions of the film; the original theatrical release, the new IMAX version (featuring the restored \\"Human Again\\" musical sequence) and the work-in-progress version that was shown to standing ovations at the New York Film Festival in 1991.<br />The story is well-known by now; A selfish Prince has been put under a dreadful curse after angering an Enchantress disguised as an old crone.  The Enchantress changes the selfish Prince into a Beast for until he learns how to love and be loved in return .Belle (voiced by Broadway veteran Paige O'Hara) is the odd girl in her small French provincial town.  She is unwittingly being romanced by the boorish, self-absorbed Gaston (Richard White), when her father gets lost in the woods on his way to the invention fair.  Discovering that he has been held a captive by an evil Beast (Robby Benson), she offers herself in his place.  Slowly but surely, Belle and the Beast fall in love, and the enchanted objects (Mrs Potts, Cogsworth, Lumiere, Wardrobe and Chip) hope that the spell will soon be broken...<br />Other stand-outs in the voice cast are Angela Lansbury (Mrs Potts), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere) and JoAnne Worley (Wardrobe).<br />The now-classic score by Alan Menken and the late Howard Ashman includes  three Oscar-nominated songs (\\"Belle\\", \\"Be Our Guest\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\") as well as \\"Gaston\\", \\"Something There\\" and \\"The Mob Song\\".<br />Extra features are plentiful and include making-of featurettes, extensive galleries and interviews as well as info and footage on the Broadway musical \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" which opened in 1994.  There are some galleries of posters and stills from the show.  However, most posters only feature later Belles's like Andrea McArdle and Toni Braxton.  I would have liked more stills of Susan Egan and Deborah Gibson.<br />There is also the \\"Break the Spell\\" game which actually starts on Disc 1 but comes over onto Disc 2.<br />BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is a true Disney classic that everyone should have in their collection.most posters only feature later Belles's like Andrea McArdle and Toni Braxton.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Are you ready for a thrill ride CD, full of Rock and Roll,R&B, Emotional Ballads, and getting dirrty? This is the \\"Thriller\\" of a new generation. Christina strips it down for everyone to see. <br />1. Stripped 1 - This is really an intro, with song attached, and it is really cool. It starts out with news stories blaring, and then slowly, Christina starts to talk and sing, and it gets you ready for whats to come on the album.<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down- This a song thats mainly for the ladies, but has a cool R&B beat to it. It's a really funky song, and is very good. It's all about being independent. A good single as well 5 STARS<BR>3. Walk Away- This is a very Powerful song. The fist ballad of the CD, and really goes deep already. Shes talking about walking away from your bad emotions to get good ones. 5 STARS<BR>4.Fighter- Walkaway fades right into this song, and next thing you know it's a very up tempo beat. Fighter is a very emotional song that shows a lot of independence, and has a very catchy chorus. This has a great video hats very different 5 STARS<BR>5. Primier Amor (Interlude)- this is the first really interlude, and it's in spanish, so I dont undestand it.<BR>6. Infatuation- This has a very latin feel to it. Even some of the lyrics are in spanish. This a very sexual lovey song. The songs is about being infatuated with her latin lover, his dark skin, and everything about him. She sang this at the 2002 Winter Olympics. 5 STARS<BR>7. Loves Embrace (Interlude)- This is a very lovey interlude. It has birds chirping and peace.<BR>8. Loving Me for Me- This song is very powerful. It's about having someone loving you for you, and not the fake you. There is even a poem right in the middle that talks about taking off the makeup, and pretty cloths. This a very fun song. 5 STARS<BR>9. Impossible- Alicia Keys did a great job composing and writing this song. It has such a catchy chorus, and very catchy verses. This song is so much fun, and full of R&B feeling. One of the best on here. 5 STARS<BR>10. Under Appreciated- This song has a very R&B feel as well. It's actually kind of repeditive, but is still a good song. The chorus is repeated many time, but almost every song on here repeats the chorus incredibly. Pretty good 4 STARS<BR>11. Beatiful- What can I say about this song. Linda Perry wrote this song, and it is so beautiful. Christina takes the lyrics and makes them hers. They lyrics speak to everyone. This is the second Balled on this album, and just sucks you in again. 10 STARS...OK 5<BR>12.Make Over- I LOVE THIS SONG! It has a great Pop/Latin/Rock feel to it. The Chorus and verses are great, and catchy. Theres nothing I can really say, but it's fun, and makes you wanna dance and head bang. It's very screamy and a similar No Doubt feel. I like to sing it when I'm pissed at someone. 5 STARS<BR>13. Cruz- This is a great song. It talks about leaving, and packing all of your things. This balled is so emotional and is so great. Whats great, is that the word Cryz is not in the song. 5 STARS<BR>14. Soar- This song is very similar to \\"Cruz\\". It all about leaving the bad behind, and getting new good life. Following your instincts. It's kinda upbeat and slow. It's about love and freedom. After hearing Cruz, you are kind of in your own little world, and just start to drift away. 5 STARS<BR>15. Get Mine Get Yours- This is a mellow, sexy song. It has a very club feeling. It's got fun verses, and just pull you into a sexy world. 4 STARS<BR>16. DIRRTY- Hehe. After you hear \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\", you are ready to hear \\"DIRRTY\\". This song is dirty, sexy, raunchy, and one of the funnest songs on here. It of course is her first single from this album, and really shows the new her. The chorus a verses<BR>are so dirty and fun. 5 STARS<BR>17. Stripped Pt. 2- She is pretty much saying \\"so what\\" to everything that the press and record companies tell her she is or askes her about. <BR>18. A Voice Within 19. I'm Ok 20. Keep on singin my song- These songsare the greates songs. \\"A Voice From within\\" and \\"I'm Ok\\" show the most emotion and show the most of Christina. She talks about dealing with abuse in her family, and feeling sad. \\"Keep on singing my song\\" is THE SONG of the album, and is pretty much saying, I'm gonna be who I want to be, when I want to, and how I want to whether you like it or not, an pulls a tremendously good CD together. 5 STARS EACH<BR>ALL IN ALL. FANTASTIC
0345446798|5.0|The Other End of the Leash is a delightful, thoughtful, and thought-provoking study of our canine friends' behaviors.  The author uses her experience as both a behaviorist and a dog owner to shed light on the often-misunderstood actions of dogs.  Her book also enables us to learn how we can best interact with our dogs -- basically, in a compassionate fashion that takes into account their individual personalities and the genetic inheritence of their species.  The Other End of the Leash includes practical advice.  You'll learn how to &quot;speak dog&quot; by using body language, how to help your dog understand that strangers and other dogs are part of his &quot;family&quot; and to take them in stride, also, and what NOT to do while training your dog.  Plus, you'll become fond of McConnell's dogs as you learn their wonderful quirks and habits!  I found this book's wisdom and emphasis on kind, compassionate dog training very impressive.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a fabulous movie and the best DVD that I own (I own more then 100).  Wow, this story blew me away, very well thought out and executed.  In my next life I want to work at Pixar, they produce only top notch products and seem to have a blast doing it (see the bonus DVD).  Disc 2 is fantastic too.  Instead of the normal half ... BS that they usually toss onto a disc to rush it to market, this one was very well done with lots of interesting stuff and \\"easter eggs\\" hidden throughout.  This is one DVD that anyone who likes movies should own.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd is the Number on my list of 2002.It knocks everything out of the pool.The kiddy pool.Hell the deep end.This cd is Soulful, RnB-licious and if a comparison (if any suit) The great Mariah Carey comes to mind.But there really is no britney-isgue pop songs here.This is a huge leap for music!!Its more, its just so much more.
B00005QW5X|5.0|It is very hard to describe this film in any common terms.<br />This is not simply an ultra-fab rock n' roll romp nor is it a dry piece of youthful corruption and ambiguous art-nouveau. <br />Hedwig is a wildly fun and smirkingly cynical film that, with enough attention, will simply floor you with it intricate design and blinding tenderness. <br />The movie mood-swings through unshakeable glamorous confidence into freakish misery, furrowed indignace, innocent eager affection, vengeful sarcastic satisfaction and the cruelty that only those closest to you can render.<br />Backed by one of the best soundtracks in history and a great caricatured host of characters and (in)appropriately comical plotlines, Hedwig suceeds in every little nook and cranny possible. You will likely be taken aback many times throughout.<br />It isn't really in the vein of Rocky Horror either. Despite some unavoidable similarities, this two are entirely headed in separate directions, (on different streets, in different towns, in different worlds). Hedwig, at its core, has so much more heart.<br />My vote is there for one of the very few top movies of all time.<br />Truly, something that must be seen to understand; something that must be understood to appreciate. My highest recommendations.
B00006RG7F|5.0|I've been following Diana Krall's career for a number of years, and to be perfectly honest, I found that her previous effort, &quot;The Look of Love,&quot; to be quite disappointing. I was convinced that she had finally sold out. However, she has more than redeemed herself with this album, &quot;Live in Paris.&quot; I've actually seen her live in Montreal at the jazz festival several years ago when it was still possible to get tickets an hour after tickets went on sale. Her performance was nothing short of stunning, and it was clear to me then that she was holding back in the recording studio. Although this disc is no substitute for the live experience, it certainly gives one a taste of Diana Krall at her best. Much of her musical creativity and improvisational wit comes through in the many tracks. I was especially enthralled by her treatment of the Billy Joel classic, &quot;Just the Way You Are,&quot; even though it is clearly a studio session.<br />I strongly recommend this disc to one and all, whether you are a long-time Diana Krall fan like me or someone who may be looking for something new. This is great jazz by a great lady.
B000000W5L|5.0|i have been reading a lot of reviews saying the mix and ragged &quot;bluesiness&quot; of this album has ruined it. But that is what makes it so cool!the sheer spontanuity of this album makes this the best rolling stones album ever.not to metioned there are some great songs on here as well.that is why they call it &quot;EXILE ON MAIN STREET&quot; because it is a detour from anything mainstreem that their record companies may have wanted.so all of you chumps that have been complaining about this album GO BACK TO YOUR SLICK OVER PRODUCED PHIL COLLINS AND CHICAGO RECORDS.you probally think steel wheels is the best stones album dont cha!
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera has one of the best voices in pop music today.  No one can deny that.  Her vocal abilities are simply amazing and soar high above those of her female pop star counterparts.  Her 1999 self-titled debut CD mated her magnificent voice with a variety of catchy pop tunes, which led to multi-platinum success for the young star.  \\"Stripped\\", Christina's second album, does contain its share of melodic pop tracks.  However, this time around the pop has more of an edge and the songs themselves show Christina's growth as both a singer and a songwriter.<br />Although this album does contain a lot of filler material such as short interludes between tracks and tracks that are bland and forgettable, the majority of the album is surprisingly well written.  \\"Fighter\\", the best song on the album, is actually a hard rock, Pat Benetar-ish number with outstanding lyrics and a very catchy chorus.  Other standout tracks include \\"Cruz\\", a very eloquent song about leaving home; \\"Beautiful\\", a ballad with very uplifting lyrics designed to make the listener feel \\"beautiful\\"; \\"Make Over\\", a song about freedom from an image-conscious world; and \\"The Voice Within\\", an uplifting song about finding strength within yourself.  <br />Other songs like \\"I'm OK\\", which Christina wrote about her abusive father, have excellent lyrics but a melody that never seems to go anywhere.  \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" is a track about having a relationship based solely on sex.  The lyrics are so forthcoming (no pun intended), that many adults will find the track offensive, and they certainly won't want their kids to listen to it.  Then there's \\"Dirrty\\", the CD's first single, which contains more lyrics that aren't exactly a parent's dream.  <br />Fans of Christina have waited three years for this album, one that Christina admits is extremely personal.  In fact, she co-wrote nearly every song on the album.  This shows that Christina has grown as a songwriter since 1999 when her entire debut album was written for her.  The result is an album filled with a wide variety of pop rock tracks that will appeal to a wide range of audiences.
B00005N919|1.0|Basic Instinct is markedly not one of cinema's finest moments. Basically, yes, as said, it is soft porn. The softest of kinds which does not even really qualify as softcore and should be relented to the wee hours of the morning on skinemax. However, don't necessarily take my word for it. There seems, however inexplicably, to be a real taste among the buying public for this stuff. I just think Stone would've done better as an extra in Caligula. <br />Anyhoo, porno aside, HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT THIS DVD COMES COMPLETE WITH A METAL ICE-PICK!? ... DOES THIS STRIKE ANYONE AS A BAD IDEA??? <br />Don't get me wrong. I believe ONE DAY people will be innately good, but holy dancing [doo-doo]. I just don't think the Stone fans should be entrusted with something like this. SHEESH!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I LOVE Christina!! I thought her first album was her, u kno all her! but i stand corrected \\"stripped\\" offers the listener a deeper insight into the real Christina.  And she can sing! theres no denying that, so of course theres gonna be some people that are going to judge her based on Dirrty but please dont she is a lot deeper than that.  she is a young ...beautiful woman who is in charge of her life and now her music.  She definitely sings the hell out of \\"soar\\" and \\"cruz\\" her uptempos are excellent too my favorite being \\"cant hold us down f/ lil kim\\" she definitely brings somethimg to the table with \\"stripped\\" and i hope everyone will BUY the album support her and enjoy the real Christina!  She took some time off, but she was making the music better for us.  The most personal song on the album is \\"I'm Okay\\" you can't help but feel emotional while Christina spills her heart out the millions that will buy this album.  I hope you will enjoy it as much as i do!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is the best CD! I can't believe it! I love how all of the songs are so different. This is like the best CD ever. Christina needed it after lying low for so long, but the CD was definitely worth the wait. Christina already has an amazing voice, and the songs she sings accentuate this strength very well. What more is there to say? Christina is back and going to take the world by storm.
B00005JKCH|1.0|This movie was monumentally bad.  I was blown away by how truly awful this film was.  It didn't come close to any of the Batman or Superman movies, not even the duds like Batman and Robin or Superman III.  Even for a superhero flick this was thin, foolish, convoluted, and just overall no fun at all.  If you want a good comic book movie, go buy the original Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  And, at all costs, avoid this travesty of a summer &quot;blockbuster&quot;.
B00006SFLV|5.0|i was an avid fan of this show from the moment it came out on tv. I was so sad whenever my mother informed me that it would be taken off the air... i was about 13 when i began watching the show and my mother always watched it with me. we both enjoyed it very much. although i was not in high school at the time, i did identify with a lot of the things that the characters went through, especially Angela, because she was really shy and had a hard time speaking up sometimes. i am so glad that this show is going to be released onto dvd.1 i just cant wait ..this is so exciting! Anyone who is anyone should buy this, i give a 100% promise they will love it!
B00006V9A0|4.0|\\"Nirvana,\\" the long awaited best of collection, offers a plethora of various Nirvana tracks that will offer a little something for both the novice fan, as well as the seasoned veteran.  It is a good retrospective that should be included in any serious music fan's record collection.  <br />Most of the songs are re-mastered for optimum sound quality, which only really shows on the Sub Pop released songs.  As I said, this collection of Nirvana songs is good, but not great.  Just like \\"The Muddy Banks of The Wishkah,\\" this album is way too short.  Clocking in at just under 50 minutes, with only 14 songs, this album is a little bit of a let down.  There could have been at least another 25 minutes of music on this CD, including other great Nirvana songs, singles, and rarities.  <br />The track listing is as follows:<BR>1.  You Know You're Right<BR>2.  About Agirl<BR>3.  Been A Son (Steve Fisk Version)<BR>4.  Sliver<BR>5.  Smells Like Teen Spirit<BR>6.  Come As You Are<BR>7.  Lithium<BR>8.  In Bloom<BR>9.  Heart-Shaped box<BR>10. Pennyroyal Tea (Scott Litt Mix)<BR>11. Rape me<BR>12. Dumb<BR>13. All Apologies (Unplugged)<BR>15. The Man Who Sold The World (David Bowie Cover, Unplugged)<br />Most Nirvana fans will already have most of these songs on the original Nirvana albums, this collection's strong selling point is the Newly Released \\"You Know You're Right,\\" Original Version of \\"Been A Son,\\" And the Single Version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea.\\"  <br />It is nice to have \\"You Know You're Right\\" on an official release, and it is good to have a retrospective of Nirvana songs to play without constantly changing CD's.....but I would have loved to see other singles and classics on the album, such as \\"Blew,\\" \\"Big Cheese,\\" \\"School,\\" \\"Floyd The Barber,\\" \\"Spank Thru,\\" \\"Annuerysm,\\" \\"Dive,\\" \\"Polly,\\" \\"Drain You,\\" \\"On A Plain,\\" \\"Something In The Way,\\" or \\"Milk It.\\"  <br />Don't get me wrong, this is a good album, especially with the liner notes by Rolling Stone's David Fricke, who has always been a great resource of Nirvana information, and who has always reported on the band without any misinformation or bias.<br />This is a must have for any Nirvana fan, or someone who is not yet totally heard all that is Nirvana.  With Christmas right around the corner, this is a perfect stocking stuffer for anyone, especially a 12 or 13 year old just getting interested in music, the same as I was when I first heard Nirvana, and had a life changing experience.
B000002HJR|5.0|Awesome fusion of Pantera's lead singer's seething voice and CoC's slick, heavy riffs. Listen to &quot;Underneath Everything&quot; and &quot;Stone the Crow&quot; and you will be sold. Almost every song on this CD is good - it is worth buying.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Like fellow \\"pop-tart\\" Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera is trying to make the transition from teen popster to adult artist.  She's already chosen her outward look, but now has to find a sound to match.  \\"Stripped\\" is the result of that search, a 20-song melange of just about every style imaginable.  There's the Latin flair of \\"Infatuation\\" (which some of you may recall from the closing ceremony of the Salt Lake Olympics), the bluesy \\"Walk Away\\", the Destiny's Child-esque \\"Underappreciated\\", the self-esteem anthem \\"Beautiful\\", a Styx/Journey-styled power-ballad entitled \\"Cruz\\" and many more, including brushes with 60's psychedelia, chick-power heavy metal, and one or two songs in which Aguilera seems to be channeling Janet Jackson.  Aguilera has a marvelous voice, no doubt about that, and she uses it to great effect; some songs are eerily reminiscient of pre-gangsta Mariah Carey, although mercifully without Carey's window-shattering shrieks.  But \\"Stripped\\"'s variety is also its weak spot, since there seems to be no unifying element.  It's as if Aguilera said to herself, \\"I can't decide which style I want to work with, so, hey, I'll try them all!\\"  Still, it's a promising third effort from a talented young woman.  We'll just have to wait to see what she comes up with next.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I will definitely admit that at first, I absolutely hated the majority of the songs on this album!  But then, little by little, they started growing on me!  I can now play this whole album and not have to skip over any of the tracks, except for a couple of the interludes.  I've never really been a big fan of interludes, unless they really stand out, like \\"Stripped Intro\\" and \\"Stripped Pt. 2\\".  I think the reason I initially disliked this album was because I was expecting the same teen pop, but with a more mature sound (ie: Britney Spears).  Don't get me wrong, she definitely has matured!  But if you're expecting \\"Genie In A Bottle\\" and \\"Come On Over Baby\\" all over again, you're going to be highly disappointed the first time you hear this!  \\"Make Over\\" is a hard rock Kelly Osbourne-type song, but Christina really makes it work!  \\"Fighter\\" has a pop-rock sound, and once again, she still pulls it off!  \\"Cruz\\", \\"Soar\\", and \\"(Keep On) Singin' My Song\\" have a slight 70's feel to them.  \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\", and \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" are excellent R and B songs.  And \\"Infatuation\\" is a Latin pop song similar to her previous work with a more mature edge.  The song most reminescent of her first album is \\"The Voice Within\\"!  Oh by the way, a warning to parents of younger children:  Christina does swear some on this CD and there is a song about sex (\\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\").  So, you might want to listen to it first before you let them listen to it!

B00006CXSS|5.0|I have seen basically every movie ever made about WW2, and Band of Brothers was hands down the best thing I've ever seen. Not only is it violent and intense, it has another side to it, it tells the story of the men of easy company and their struggles through the war. At the end of the series you really feel a strong kinship with the men of easy company. The acting is superb as well as the cinematography. I STRONGLY suggest anyone who likes war films and documentaries to see this serious. You will not regret it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|In the midst of the release of past teeny boppers on solo efforts (Justin Timberlake, Nick Carter, Jennifer Love Hewitt), Christina's sophomore album arrives after years of somewhat silence from her in comparision to those blondes she is always put up against (Britney, Jessica, Mandy).  Just from the cover of the album, it's apparent Christina has definately grown up in her image (the pictures in the album reveal it even more).  Her sophomore effort definately departs from the radio friendly songs like \\"What a Girl Wants\\" and \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and she becomes the sensual woman (even admitting her lack of innocence on the interlude \\"Stripped Pt. 2\\".  The album interesting begins with \\"Stripped Pt. 1\\", a menagerie of past commentaries of Christina over the past two years then she speaks...definately a stop.  \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" doesn't just skirt being provocative...it's blunt and provocative with the addition of Lil Kim on it as well.  \\"Walk Away\\" is probably my fav song on the whole album, dark but almost takes you back to the images of Madonna in Dick Tracy as the seductively powerful Breathless.  \\"Fighter\\" is probably the hardest track on the album but very good.  \\"Infatuation\\" has the Latin twinge but probably the most disappointing song on the album (besides the single \\"Dirrty\\").  To go through all the songs would take quite a long time (since there are 16 tracks, almost all written by Aguilera herself).  The CD speaks not only of strength and pain but also chronicles the transition from girl of the past to the woman of today.  If this is a precursor to Christina's future, it looks very very bright and strong.

0446310786|4.0|Scout, a young girl in a quiet southern town, is about to experience the dramatic events that will affect the rest of her life. She and her brother Jem are being raised by their widower father Atticus and by a strong-minded housekeeper Calpurnia. Wide-eyed Scout is fascinated with the sensitively revealed people of her small town but, from the start, there's a rumble of thunder just under the calm surface of the life here. The black people of the community have a special feeling about Scout's father and she doesn't know why. A few of her white friends are inexplicably hostile and Scout doesn't understand this either. Unpleasant things are shouted and the bewildered girl turns to her father. Atticus, a lawyer, explains that he's defending a young Negro wrongfully accused of a grave crime. Since this is causing such an upset, Scout wants to know why he's doing it. \\"Because if I didn't,\\" her father replies, \\"I couldn't hold my head up.\\" <BR>Scout Finch recalls three years of her childhood during the Depression in Maycomb, Alabama, beginning the summer before her first grade. She lives with her older brother Jem and their lawyer father, Atticus, a widower. That summer they find a new friend named Dill Harris, whose interest in stirring up drama leads the children to try to entice the town bogeyman, Boo Radley, to come out. Meanwhile, a drama affecting the adults begins as Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer, accuses Tom Robinson, an African-American, of rape. Atticus is called on to defend the accused while Scout and Jem struggle to understand issues of prejudice and justice. The two dramas intersect as one person is killed, Jem's arm is broken, and Boo Radley does indeed come out.
B000002UML|5.0|For Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" album, Ian Anderson writes the lyrics, composes the music, sings the songs, does the arrangements, and then finds time to play the flute, acoustic guitar, violin, saxophone, trumpet and whatever else is lying around. On top of that, he creates Gerald \\"Little Milton\\" Bostock, the eight-year-old prodigy whose scandalous poem \\"Thick as a Brick\\" was deemed unfit to receive first prize from The Society For Literary Achievement And Gestation (SLAG), and Julian Stone-Mason B.A., who reviews the Jethro Tull album \\"Thick as a Brick.\\" All of this is chronicled in the four pages of the St. Cleve's Chronicle, all of which is faithfully reproduced for the little booklet that comes with this CD. The review by \\"Stone-Mason\\" concludes: \\"One doubts at times the validity of what appears to be an expanding theme throughout the two continuous sides of this record but the result is at worst entertaining and at least aesthetically palatable.\\" Who am I to argue? I enjoy the satirical articles in Anderson's faux newspaper (e.g., \\"Non-Rabbit Missing\\") almost as much as I enjoy the music on the album.<br />Thematically \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is similar to \\"Aqualung.\\" Again the writing is dense and enigmatic, but of course this is part of the fun. Anderson bemoans the social decay but he sees salvation down the road, but ultimately the lyrics take a back suit to the music and the brilliant arrogance of creating sections on the \\"single track\\" that are unique and yet clearly part of the whole. The thematic unity of the songs on \\"Aqualung\\" (well, the second side of the album) is now more than matched by a musical integration of various styles into a complete whole. You can recognize aspects of English folk music and classical bits in the mode of Handel, along with various types of jazz. One of the nice results of this grand design is that for the first time Anderson's singing seems well suited to the music. By this point in the group's history Anderson had surrounded himself with the musicians who would finally allow him to explore his unique artistic vision. In the end just remember: \\"your wise men don't know how it feels/to be thick as a brick.\\" This is Jethro Tull's best album from start to finish, although certainly they come close to reclaiming the magic in \\"Passion Play.\\"nded himself with the musicians who would finally allow him to explore his unique artistic vision.

0060989157|5.0|Ohmygosh, where do I begin. Um, this book is amazing. Not only because the writing is straightforward and you really begin to develop an understanding of the problems that the band members had, but because you also begin to realize that these guys have nine lives.<br />How on EARTH any of them survived all the drug overdoses, random sexual escapades, car crashes, stage accidents, or jealous women is a testament to how much God REALLY wanted us to hear their story. <br />This book is also a great character study. All the guys were totally into drugs, sex, alcohol, and childish pranks. But because they are so honest and open about all the things they did wrong, by the end of the book you find yourself liking them. Granted, you probably won't agree with anything they did.
B00006L90T|5.0|&quot;Carnival of Souls,&quot; the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it almost on a par with dead George Romero's &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; in terms of shoestring productions (In fact, the two films appear together on a recent DVD Double Feature). Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving. Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town. Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her. Again and again Mary has the eerie experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her. Eventually she returns to the pavilions to come to the terrifying realization of what has happened.<br />&quot;Carnvial of Souls&quot; came about because Herk Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film. The man was definitely right on that score.  Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such. Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Lee Strassberg himself but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director (think about it), only made one other film, &quot;Curse of the Living Corpse&quot; (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field. Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 &quot;Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls&quot; debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.  Given the high gloss shlock that is out there it is nice to see a horror film that is actually effective at creating a sense of unease without resorting to special effects.  Yes, the ending is predictable TODAY, but stop and think what things were like in the early Sixties before &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; covered practically every ironic twist in the book.cop in the 1998 &quot;Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls&quot; debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.

B00006F7S4|3.0|If you liked MUTATIONS you'll love SEA CHANGE. If you loved MIDNITE VULTURES and STEREOPATHETIC SOUL MANURE then SEA CHANGE is one to avoid. Beck's best low-key effort is ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE. That record is genius. If you have that one already you probably have LEONARD COHEN's firt record, or maybe his BEST OF? SEA CHANGE sounds forced and dishonest. A great down-tepo record this year is CORNELIUS' POINT. At one time refered to as Japan's answer to BECK with his cut-and-paste style on FANTASMA, POINT is the most beautiful album out this year. Oh, anyone know why the covers on the SEA CHANGE CD change? That is the coolest part about it!
B000003JA9|5.0|\\"Aqualung\\" is certainly the rawest of Jethro Tull's albums, as far from the artistic pretensions of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"Passion Play\\" as you can get in terms of their albums.  This might have something to do with the album's mission statement, which is printed in old fashioned type on the linear notes: \\"In the beginning Man created God; and in the image of Man created he him....But as all these things did come to pass, the Spirit that did cause man to create his God lived on with all men: even within Aqualung.  And man saw it not.  But for Christ's sake he'd better start looking.\\"  Ironically, this is one of the few Jethro Tull albums where the lyrics are not printed despite the fact this is arguably the album where the lyrics mattereth the most.<br />The first \\"side\\" of the album, entitled \\"Aqualung\\" after the first/title track, offers nothing overt other than the idea of dismissing organized religion as \\"salvation &agrave; la mode and a cup of tea.\\"  However, the second side, \\"My God,\\" makes its argument in earnest from the opening verse: \\"People - what have you done/locked Him in His golden cage/Made Him bend to your religion/Him resurrected from the grave.\\"  The Church of England is explicitly condemned for having supplanted the authenticity of the Christian religion with plastic crucifixes.  \\"Hymn 43\\" continues this line of argument by suggesting that: \\"If Jesus saves - well, He'd better save Himself from the gory glory seekers who use His name in death.\\"  \\"Slipstream\\" offers a metaphorical look at sinners trying to save themselves at the last moment: \\"And you press on God's waiter your last dime/as he hands you the bill.\\"  That \\"Slipstream\\" comes right before \\"Locomotive Breath\\" makes sense when you look at the latter's lyrics in light of the former.<br />But Ian Anderson's diatribe against the organized religion of his country does not extend to God, as is amply proven by the concluding song, \\"Wind Up.\\"  To underscore the importance of what is being sung at this point, the music tends to get out of the way of the lyrics, especially the final lines: \\"I don't believe you/you had the whole damn thing all wrong/He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.\\"  When the teachings of the church consist of nothing more than \\"half-assed smiles and the book of rules,\\" this necessitates a more personal dialogue with God.  In Anderson's world God replies with a firm answer.  When Anderson declares \\"I'd rather look around me - compose a better song/`cos that's the honest measure of my worth,\\" he is staking a claim to more piety and sanctity than the edifices he is indicting.<br />The second side of \\"Aqualung\\" aspires to being much more than mere rock `n' roll.  The message is simplistic, but still compelling.  \\"Aqualung\\" represents Ian Anderson speaking in relatively clear words; from here on the will cloak his lyrics in metaphors and his own brand of mysticism.  But for me it is ultimately the clarity of the lyrics and the intended message that makes this the strongest of Jethro Tull's albums.  There are certainly more pleasing melodies down the road, but that does nothing to diminish the raw power of this effort.this point, the music tends to get out of the way of the lyrics, especially the final lines: \\"I don't believe you/you had the whole damn thing all wrong/He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.\\"  When the teachings of the church consist of nothing more than \\"half-assed smiles and the book of rules,\\" this necessitates a more personal dialogue with God.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" has rarely been retold in a manner that breaks the mold and gives the leads dimension. But Disney's production of the classic fairy tale, one of the last truly great Disney movies, was an outstanding feature that attracted the attention of adults and kids alike. And now the movie has been rereleased with a second DVD and some deleted material that viewers have never seen before.<br />Bookish Belle (Paige O'Hara) is something of an oddity in her village -- viewed as a dreamy weirdo by the villagers, and viewed with possessive intent by the arrogant hunk Gaston (Richard White). Belle is, unsurprisingly, completely uninterested in Gaston -- something that makes him even more determined to marry her. But Belle's life changes when her inventor father Maurice (Rex Everhart) becomes lost in a sinister forest on his way to a fair. He finds shelter in a giant, seemingly abandoned castle -- only to be dragged off to a cell by an enormous, shadowy figure.<br /><br />Belle finds her way to the castle, and locates Maurice. But the enormous, savage Beast that rules the castle will only release Maurice if Belle agrees to stay in the castle -- forever. (We learn at the beginning that a spell of true love will turn the Beast back into a human being -- but the time limit is approaching) Belle agrees, and Maurice is sent back to the village. He frantically tries to gain help from the other villagers, but they laugh and dismiss him as crazy.<br /><br />At the castle, which is populated by intelligent furniture such as lovesick candlelabra Lumiere (Jerry Orbach), teapot Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), and fretful clock Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), Belle is growing to love the Beast, and the Beast is becoming more gentle. But Gaston's jealousy and the village's fear threatens Belle and the Beast both...<br /><br />The additions to this DVD make it worth buying even if you already have a copy. A musical sequence never before seen has been picked up from the cutting-room floor and pasted back where it originally was: \\"Human Again,\\" a charming upbeat song and dance number (if what the animate object characters do can be called \\"dancing\\") that will rank up with \\"Be Our Guest\\" and \\"Belle\\" as a favorite. Moreover, the film has been digitally remastered, giving it a fresh, bright look -- most noticeable during the dance scene.<br /><br />The second DVD contains plenty of good stuff. In the \\"Mrs. Potts\\" section there is a personality checker, where viewers can see who they most resemble; also intriguing interviews with several Disney voice-actors, including Celine Dion, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara, Angela Lansbury and more. Behind everyone's favorite clock-and-candle duo is a virtual gallery; behind Chip is some behind-the-scenes revelations about how the movie was made and a cute music game. Music videos (Celine Dion-haters better steer clear) and a very difficult \\"Spell Adventure Game,\\" that may challenge even die-hard fans who thought they could do it all. And for more insights into the movie, there is an \\"audio commentary\\" that can be switched on as the film plays. Be sure to check out the extras on the first disc, as the hardest game on the second hinges on information in the first.<br /><br />Qualitywise, the film is outstandingly charming. There's romance, presented in a charmingly realistic manner; humor, ranging from the Beast's new hairstyle (\\"You look so... so...\\" \\"Stupid.\\") to Cogsworth's hysterical blathering. Character development is at its best here: Belle is a gal with a brain and her own mind, who isn't afraid to dream while keeping her feet on the ground when she needs to. The Beast initially will get no sympathy, but his gradual transformation from a blustering bully to a vulnerable sweetie. Gaston will elicit nothing but scorn; bumbling but good-hearted Maurice will charm viewers. And the \\"animate objects\\" are equally entertaining, bickering and conspiring and frantically trying to pair Belle and the Beast sothat they can be \\"Human Again.\\"<br /><br />This \\"tale as old as time\\" is perhaps even more entrancing than before, seen at a more-than-full length with plenty of extras.

B00000JHAU|5.0|While I was in Kenya between late 1996 and early 1998, a number of phenomena took place back in the U.S.A. that I missed out on.  Bill Clinton endured the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the Spice Girls went from obscurity to superstardom and back to obscurity, astonishing numbers of white teenagers in southeastern Virginia began dressing like they came from the hood, and a small cadre of students on my New York City university campus began sporting T-shirts from the obscure Scottish folk pop band, Belle and Sebastian.  Missing any one of these events alone would have been cause for concern, but I missed all four.  By the time I was back on campus in NYC in the spring of 1998, Belle and Sebastian T-shirts had become the de rigeur fashion accessory for angsty male undergrads.  As a grad student, I should have felt no compulsion to explore Belle and Sebastian, but something told me I should do so anyway.  And I am ever so glad I did.<br />My first purchase was If You're Feeling Sinister which is quite simply an acoustic pop masterpiece.  That's high praise coming from this reviewer who, as you probably know, is a metal aficionado first and foremost.  Band members gently strum their guitars like Johnny Marr on valium, while Stuart Murdoch purrs lyrics about girls and love that border on the poetic.  The ten songs flow seamlessly together with the listener hardly noticing the transitions.  There are really no highlights here since every song is an impressive achievement.  Every song is catchy and many of the lyrics are slyly clever in a Steven Morrissey sort of way.<br />At this point, you're probably thinking, \\"J.F.C. is sure making a lot of Smiths references here.  What's up with that?\\"  Hey, it's not my fault if Belle and Sebastian sound like they've listened to some Smiths in their day.  Who among us hasn't?  Still, I shouldn't overstate the similarities between the two bands since they are really quite limited; Belle and Sebastian are their own band with their own unmistakable sound - and a great sound it is.  My girlfriend and I have quite different musical tastes - she has a longstanding fondness for Vietnamese popular and traditional music and Madonna while I am a long-time metalhead, but we both agree on the greatness of If You're Feeling Sinister.  When we were first going out, it was about all we could agree on to listen to.  Don't worry - things have become a lot better musically between us since then.  And in case you're wondering whether I was ever seen wearing a Belle and Sebastian T-shirt around my old campus, the answer is `no'.  That's an outfit better left to the undergrads, though I did make a habit of naively walking around campus in a Slayer t-shirt my first year there before suddenly realizing one day while playing a computer game that the images the t-shirt portrayed might be offensive to many individuals on campus.  But, that's a story for another day.  For now, all you need to know is that I highly recommend If You're Feeling Sinister and my girlfriend does too.
B00006CXXU|5.0|The title of Aguilera's latest studio release, Stripped, evokes multiple interpretations ranging from the raw, dirty-girl image buttressed by the set's first single \\"Dirrty,\\" to the intimate, extremely emotional see-saw embodied by consecutive tracks \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Fighter,\\" which together comprise the story of a woman scorned turned woman strong. The album incorporates elements from different musical arenas (L'il Kim, Alicia Keys, and Redman make appearances), but \\"The Loves Embrace Interlude\\" sounds a little too much like the Mariah interludes ala Butterfly (but what better artist to attempt to emulate?). Note though that Aguilera's attention to different musical sources is not a last-ditch attempt by a washed-out has-been, nor is it a not-a-girl-anymore-but-still-not-a-woman grasping for identity definition. Rather, the multiple layers Aguilera exhibits are a pleasure to listen to and a testament to her well-developed vocal technique.<br />Aguilera has stripped herself of the often-criticized mold of her teen-pop peers and has moved on to the more adult world of artistic responsibility. Aguilera co-executive produced this album and co-wrote many of its multi-layered tracks, and, considering the variation and depth found consistently on Stripped, this can be considered a success for the still-emerging and, more important to point out, still-young artist, who has the potential to out-diva even the most prized divas in their best days. But, her formidable vocal technique aside, Aguilera bests other divas a decade her senior with her niche-breaking, genre-busting musicality. At home singing pop and diva-esque anthems, musical showtunes, bluesy torch songs, and intricately rhythmic hip-hop, Aguilera may just have the best vocal technique we've seen in a long time that can jump effortlessly from one genre to the next. She delivers all of this with a dripping sensuality and perfect precision that define a talent who was a born natural but who can also manipulate her voice about as well as successful instrumentalists manipulate their instruments.  <br />Overall, Stripped is an amazingly entertaining album. Unlike the single-threads that tie together tracks on the albums of the best-selling female artists of today, Stripped defies categorization. Aguilera's second album isn't just a dance album, it isn't just an album to sit and listen to, and it isn't singularly introspective or inspirational; it's all of that and then some. It's a set that asks you to really listen for its multiple layers, but one that also satisfies the discerning listener with an unexpected showcase of sheer talent.
B00006CXXU|4.0|When I bought this CD, I was expecting it to be songs like \\"Dirrty,\\" just R&amp;B. Was I wrong. \\"Dirrty,\\" is one of the only R&amp;B songs on the album. This album is a blend of different musical tastes and a HUGE step creatively for Ms. Aguilera, who co-wrote a whopping 14 out of the 16 songs on this album, the other two written by Alicia Keys(who I can't stand) and Linda Perry. 3 songs Aguilera wrote with Perry, Pink's \\"M!ssundaztood\\" collaborator. There is rock (\\"Fighter,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Make Over\\"); gospel (\\"Soar,\\" \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\"); R&amp;B (\\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" \\"Get Mine, Get Yours,\\" \\"Dirrty\\"); latin (\\"Infatuation\\"); funk (\\"Underappreciated,\\"); and a load of ballads (\\"Walk Away,\\"-which sounds like a Fiona Apple song- \\"Loving Me 4 Me,\\" Alicia Keys' \\"Impossible,\\" \\"Cruz,\\" \\"The Voice Within,\\" and \\"I'm OK,\\" which Perry co-wrote and, interestingly enough, reminds me a great deal of Pink's \\"Family Portrait,\\" which Perry also co-wrote).<BR>Over all, it is a good sophomore effort, and I have a great deal more respect for her now that she has creative control. I can't stand industry-controlled music, and I'm happy to say that Christina is taking the Madonna route and writing her own music.
6305907145|5.0|First off let me say, anyone who has ever read a book then seen the movie adaptation will know that rarely are movies ever faithful to the book, but that aside, this is an EXCELLENT, thoroughly enjoyable movie throughout. I have watched it several times, and I never tire of it. Even though I know the ending, I still find myself waiting in suspense.<BR>I love period movies, and this one is wonderful, full of subtilities and things implied but not necessarily spoken, much like it would have been in the &quot;proper&quot; times it is set. Even after many viewings I still find I pick up on things I missed before. <BR>Don't buy it if you are looking for faithful representation of the book but please DO buy it if you are looking for a story you will enjoy over and over and be glad you added it to your collection!

1577311523|1.0|Yes, there is quite a bit to be learned from this book. However, there is quite a bit of garbage in it, too.  The present need not be sequestered so totally from the past and future.  By insisting on freedom from all but the now, Tolle recommends total restriction.  There are ways to regard past and future without being bound or defined by them and without allowing the present to lose its meaning.  Tolle's limitations need not become your own.  The past can have meaning and the future can be contemplated without a collapse of the lustre of the present. All things have meaning -- there are more portals than the ones Tolle deems valid.  I enjoyed reading this book -- partly because I enjoy kicking ideas around, and partly because Tolle illuminates the essence of some large ideas with the light of his own limited outlook.  Fellow readers and seekers -- don't fall for a system this limited.  Meaning, truth, being, whatever words you want to use to describe aspects of the ineffable, are not subject to Tolle's limits.
B00006V9A0|3.0|\\"Niravana\\", the much anticipated greatest hits CD from the band that revolutionized the rock music industry, sadly falls short of the expectations of Nirvana's many fans. The official track listing is as follows:<br />1. You Know You're Right<BR>2. About A Girl<BR>3. Been A Son<BR>4. Silver<BR>5. Smells Like Teen Spirit<BR>6. Come As You Are<BR>7. Lithium <BR>8. In Bloom<BR>9. Heart-Shaped Box<BR>10. Pennyroyal Tea<BR>11. Rape Me<BR>12. Dumb<BR>13. All Apologies*<BR>14. The Man Who Sold the World*<BR>*off of \\"MTV Ungplugged in New York\\" album<br />All of the songs have been digitally remastered, which gives them a cleaner, crisper sound. Although the songs sound great, why weren't classic songs such as \\"Something In The Way\\", \\"Drain You\\", \\"Aneurysm\\", \\"Silver\\", and \\"Love Buzz\\" included on this \\"Greatest Hits\\"  album, while the song \\"Been A Son\\" is? At least 10 additional tracks could have been added to this album to make it more of a \\"greatest compilations\\" album. This should be an excellent CD for new Nirvana fans to get a good ground base of the songs, but personally, I think long time Nirvana fans will be trult disappointed.
0062502182|4.0|This a very interesting story where the main character is a shepherd. He wants to find a treasure and he thinks that he will find it within the Pyramids. He will have an initiatic travel and will meet very interesting characters (small masters as I would call them) and adventures. It is a kind of alchemical internal change that will happen to the hero. But the main lesson is at the end. I am not sure that everybody caught it but for those who are following a spiritual path, there is a very important clue or lesson. So do not miss it!
B000069KE0|5.0|i'm sorry but i have to give my two cents. i haven't bought these remastered versions simply because the original vinyl releases are superior. this is not to say i won't eventually though. analog is the most accurate in that it reproduces the full spectrum of sound. as far as the presence of tape hiss being on remastered cd's, that's a good sign. the older the recording, the more hiss in most cases. it still being there is a sign of the engineer not messing with the mix with noise reduction or re-equalizing, which cannot be done without taking some of the \\"musicality \\" away. for me, i have no problem with tape hiss, or the pops and crackles of vinyl; i listen to the MUSIC and therefore any background noise is blocked out. Rhino is usually very good at preserving the orginal sound, as opposed to Motown for example, which when remastering Stevie Wonders classic albums, sucked the life out of the music with obvioius re-equalizing. I praise  Rhino for having what i call respect for the original engineers and their hard work(much moreso than today). Long live tape hiss!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album by far is Christina Aguilera's best album yet. She has completely moved from the whole bubblegum pop scene and matured both as a woman and professionally in her music. Her songs are not the normal mix of cliche songs about romance and love instead they talk about real life experiences, heartbreak, and independence. One of the songs that really got me emotionally worked up is the song titled \\"I'm Ok\\" which talks about Christina's experience as a child with her father abusing her mother, and all the pain her mother went through and how Christina grew up in fear of her father. This song seemed to have been pretty emotional for both Christina to write and perform because it must have brought back such painful memories for her. Another amazing song is titled \\"Beautiful\\" which is an amazing anthem for all people wether it is an overweight kid dealing with other people harrassing them, or a gay man or woman dealing with criticism in a very straight society, it is saying that you should not let harsh words of people put you down because no matter what you are beautiful. Another amazing song is \\"Make Over\\" which has a very 70's rock feel to it and a great beat. \\"Impossible\\" which is a duet Christina does with r&b singer Alicia Keys has a very bluesy, almost old school feel to it, another great duet on this album.  Christina's songs talk about living life, being free, doing what you feel in yout heart is best, not letting other people tell you what to do, and just being strong. This album has truly inspired me in so many ways, it has definitely taught me to love myself and be strong no matter what. Her sound is by far like nothing I have ever heard: she mixes rock with pop, pop with old school rock, rap with latino, pop with r&b. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" which is another duet with Lil' Kim proves to another amazing duet and a great anthem for all women. Christina's talents go far beyond her singing and dancing: she has proven in this album to be a truly talented writerand she will definitely be on the music scene for years to come: much longer than other popstars have wished or tried to be.
B000065U1N|1.0|This is simply one long war scene with no character development at all.<br />Sure, it may well portray what war is really like but that's about the sum of it.   Nothing more nothing less.
B000005RFI|5.0|This album is a classic in every sense of the word..Every song is great! Along with Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath is the greatest rock band!! Now who wouldn't agree with that propostion unless you have been buried under a rock or just simply not a rock fan at all..This REMASTERED edition is just totally awesome in terms of sound quality..I think all Ozzy era and 1 exception of Dio with \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is Black Sabbath..After that Iommi should have continued as a solo act..When Bill Ward left the band in 1980, that was the end of Sabbath as far as I am concerned until they reunited..He was a phenomenal drummer along the likes of John Bonham..\\"War Pigs\\" is one of the greatest songs ever written..This is Sabbath's true crowning achievement followed very closely by \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" and \\"Master of Reality\\"..All I can say is if you don't have this album, smack yourself upside the head and BUY IT NOW! since you got to have it.PARANOID RULES!!

B00006CXXU|4.0|I never thought that I would hear a Christina Aguilera song and say \\"Wow,\\" but that's exactly what I said the first time I heard \\"Beautiful.\\" This girl has an amazing voice, she is truly gifted, and this album actually shows what she can do. All the trelling and extra stuff she did in the past three years was really just for show. The real deal is on this album. My dad is a die hard Beatles fan, and he has instilled in me that the mark of a great artist is if every song sounds different, and Christina has certainly accomplished that with this album. Good for her for kicking the genie to the curb and welcoming in some raw and genuine emotion.
B00006LSCX|4.0|The album is simply a reedition of her highly successful album Fever. It contains a bonus disc with all of her best remixes of her last singles. The US mix of the Love At First Sight song is incredibly catchy, it's actually the songs that's been played on the radio last summer. Moreover, the remix of her current hit Comme into my world captures the essence of her video for the same song. <br />The special edition is strategy from the labels in order to gain sales during the lucrative Christmas period, but for any pop fans, it's a good way to sweeten your grey november days .
B000002UAF|5.0|This album capped a phenomenal year for Beatlemania in the U.S.  In 1964 alone, the Beatles had 19 Top 40 singles.  In April they had the top five singles in the country:  &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; &quot;She Loves You,&quot; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Please Please Me.&quot;  But despite the saturation of Beatles' product, the surprising thing is that there was no drop off in quality.  Also worth noting is that this is their first album to feature all original material.<br />Only nine of these songs appeared on the original U.S. version.  The other four tracks (&quot;Things We Said Today,&quot; &quot;When I Get Home,&quot; &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Back&quot;) would find their way on other U.S. releases from The Beatles Second Album to Beatles '65.  Highlights include the title track, &quot;Can't Buy Me Love,&quot; &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; and &quot;You Can't Do That.&quot;<br />This is a must-have souvenir of 1964-era Beatlemania.  If you weren't there when it happened, this LP (and the accompanying film) will let you in on what all the excitement was about.  ESSENTIAL
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is with no doubt one of the most talented artists out there. Her amazing vocals makes this album amazing. She has never disapointed me.<br />1. Stripped Pt. 1<BR>-this part is basicly tellin off all of the people who [peaved] her off like fred durst and emenem and the whole christina vs. britney thing. she also basicly says that shes waited a long time to do an album HER way.<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down (feat.

B00006V9A0|5.0|I mean, anyone who doesnt at least respect the talent of the Nirvana guys has no soul!!  I could have seen quite a few more songs on here...Drain You, Big Cheese,etc...but all in all for a greatest hits its great!  The \\"new\\" song You Know you're Right is just chilling, i cried the first time i heard it, because you can sense his feelings that went into the song-he didnt just sing like many \\"musicians\\" out there today! Pennyroyal Tea sounds awesome remastered, it just seems more finished than it was before.  I know there is not much sense to getting this album if your a fan like me who has had all their stuff since it came out...but it is especially good for newer Nirvana fans!  I am glad Courtney Krist and Dave finally got over their spat and just released this damn thing...it is a historical piece that everyone should own, right up there with the Beatles, Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd, etc....get it!
B00006CXXU|1.0|I really think Christina is one of the most talented singers ever. Her powerful voice has conquered the hearts of millions of fans. That's why I picked up this CD without hesitation. Well, i have to admit that i am quite disappointed with this CD. I feel this album is more of a venting place for her than a musical work for the fans. Most of the songs deal with her personal issues and the music [is terrible]. what a waste of resource.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I did enjoy this film, but there were some things that annoyed me.  First of all, I had a hard time buying Matt Damon as a high powered assassin.  He's a little too much of a \\"pretty boy\\" and seemed way too young.  The other agents, those assigned to kill him, were much more believeable.  Now, I haven't read the book, but I've heard plenty about it.  The Professor, the assassin that completed Bourne's failed mission, was supposed to be his equal, if not superior, in skill.  However, the Professor was done away with in about 5 minutes, by Bourne.  And lastly, I can't stand when a character gets kicked, punched, sprayed with glass, etc., and never has the slightest bruise or cut.  He falls down several flights of stairs and doesn't even get an ankle sprain.  I understand Bourne is a top agent, but he's not armor plated.  These are nit picky things, I'll admit, but I'm a pretty harsh movie critic.  On the positive side, I did like the story and 99% of the casting.  The action was excellent and the acting was pretty good.
0767903854|5.0|If you have not yet tried Bryson,  you probably should seek psychiatric help.  He's funny and informative; travel-writing (if you can call it that) at its best.   His Walk in the Woods is a classic, and while this book about his visit to Australia is not as uproariously funny - the country is, after all, home to the ten most poisonous animals in the world - his descriptions of Australian institutions will delight you. His description of cricket, a game that has nothing wrong with it that \\"the introduction of golf carts wouldn't fix in a hurry,\\" is a good example. \\"It is not true that the English invented cricket as a way of making all other human endeavors look interesting and lively;  that was merely an unintended side effect.\\" It is a very popular sport (?) that's \\"enjoyed by millions, some of them awake and facing the right way, but it is an odd game.  It is the only sport that incorporates meal breaks.  It is the only sport that shares its name with an insect.  It is the only sport in which the spectators burn as many calories as players - more if they are moderately restless. It is the only competitive activity of any type, other than perhaps baking, in which you can dress in white from head to toe and be as clean at the end of the day as you were at the beginning.\\" The pitcher runs at the batter (decked out with a riding hat and \\"heavy gloves of the sort used to handle radioisotopes, and a mattress strapped to each leg,\\") and throws the ball at his ankles. This can go on indefinitely until he is  \\"coaxed into a mis-stroke that leads to his being put out [at which time] all the fielders throw up their arms in triumph and have a hug.  Then tea is called. . . .\\" This usually goes on until your library books are all overdue and autumn has become winter.  Of course, listening to cricket on the radio is truly something else: \\"That's right, Clive.  I haven't known anyone start his delivery that far back since Stopcock caught his sleeve on the reversing mirror of a number 11 bus during the third test at Brisbane in 1957 and ended up in Goondiwindi four days later owing to some frightful confusion over a changed timetable at Toowoomba Junction.\\"   There are long silences during which the announcers have time to run some errands. \\"So we break for second luncheon, and with 11,200 balls remaining, Australia are 962 for two not half and England are four for a duck and hoping for rain.\\"<br />    Australia remade itself as a country following the Second World War.  It realized that with such a small population, it could not afford to rely forever on Britain for its defense and it began to encourage immigration, \\"that if it didn't use all that empty land and fill those empty spaces someone from the outside might do it for them.\\"  They threw open their doors and the population more than doubled in the years following 1945.  They welcomed people from all over Europe and \\"suddenly Australia was full of people who liked wine and good coffee and olives and eggplants, and realized that spaghetti didn't have to be a vivid orange and come from cans.\\"   By 1970, they also realized they had become an Asian nation and were no longer predominantly European and they simply eliminated the color bar they previously had used to ban \\"undesirables.\\"  \\"In a single generation, Australia remade itself.  It went from being a half-forgotten outpost of Britain, provincial, dull, and culturally dependent, to being a nation infinitely more sophisticated, confident, interesting and outward-looking. And it did all this, by and large, without discord or disturbance, or serious mistakes - indeed often with a kind of grace.\\"<br />     Of course, if you are an Aborigine, the outlook is somewhat different and Bryson, to his credit, does not overlook the truly horrible discrimination and crimes committed against this venerable and ancient people - their history is truly astonishing.  Whites in Australia had a tendency to treat them the way whites in this country treatedthe buffalo.<br />     The vastness of Australia cannot be underestimated, and it's a naturalist's paradise with new species being discovered - and probably made extinct - almost daily. The mineral wealth is enormous and barely tapped, not to mention a biodiversity that includes living fossils.  There is a species of living rock that dates back to the early eons of the earth and is worth a visit halfway around the world just to see it - if you can avoid the most venomous animals in the world, the sharks, the crocodiles and all the other poisonous stuff.  A marvelous book.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Folks, I waited 2 years for this album to come out, and I was the first one to buy it at the local music store here, just past midnight on Tuesday.  Anyone who is even a moderate Nirvana fan is going to want this album, as it contains 14 songs you are sure to want.  If you already have all of Nirvana's albums, you're still going to want to add this to your collection.  'You know you're Right' is a new classic song by Nirvana...it's haunting music and lyrics fit right into this wonderful collection of music...so, as I like to say....do yourself a favor, and buy the best CD of the year so far!
B00005JKDR|3.0|The graphics and effects are beautiful, and if that's enough to keep you entertained for about 80 minutes, look no further, as this has exquisite computer animation, cuddly (read: easily converted to plush toys) characters, and a rich spectrum of facial animation, particularly on the little girl \\"Boo.\\"  <BR>    That said, however, Monsters Inc never bothers to tell a story.  It's all staging and set up to tell a story.  Essentially, you get an 80 minute view as to what life would be like in a monster world on the periphery of our dimension, and a weak subplot on how monsters get their energy.  The villains are transparently obvious, there's really never any sense of threat or accomplishment, and the resolution, if any, is very tepid -- essentially, life goes on as normal in Monsteropolis.  <BR>     Very appealing I'm sure to young children, I don't see myself watching it again, and I'm sure it'll get pretty boring for adults who regularly rewatch movies with their kids.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is one of the most amazing CDs ever! Instead of getting shallow pointless bubblegum pop from artists such as Britney, we get something deep and personal from Christina Aguilera, someone who can actually sing.<BR>My favorite is Fighter, it's so rock and totally Christina! I'm OK is heartwrenching.. Impossible is a really strong song as well.. all of her ballads are beautiful and can't hold us down should be a single as well..<BR>I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!
B00006AUIG|3.0|About ten minutes into Session 9, I was completely prepared to love this movie.  The setting, an old, empty insane asylum with its own morgue and cemetary, was creepy as hell; and the premise about a cleanup crew hired to eliminate asbestos tiles and other toxic materials had real potential.  Also, the characters and the acting were above average for a modern horror flick.  For these reasons, I give the movie three stars.<br />The problem with this movie is, it never quite delivers on what the first few minutes promises you.  This asylum offers a lot of scare potential that the movie doesn't take advantage of.  And I really don't mind a scary movie starting slow, but Session 9 STAYS slow.  It doesn't pick up the pace until the last fifteen minutes or so...and the ending, designed to be a shocking twist, just isn't.<br />So, bottom line: if you're a hardcore horror fan, check this one out.  It might work better for you than it did for me.  Other movie viewers should probably steer clear.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's sophomore album is quite an achievement, considering that it has 16 full length cuts.  Of the 16, I instantly liked 14, I even liked the 4 interludes.  The other two I'm sure will grow on me.  My favorites are the near perfect \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Impossible\\", \\"Cruz\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\".  With can't-argue-with talent, looks and the right attitude, this album should catapult Christina back to the top in no time.<br />\\"Dirrty\\", the first single and video from the album may be a little misleading, since the album title refers more to being emotionally stripped and stripped from all the over-produced, slick pop princess packages we see. Let's hope that Christina has gotten the dirtiness out of her system, so we can focus on her singing and not her shaking.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I first heard \\"Dirrty\\" on the radio with its driving beats and vocals, I thought: Oh my Lord what did she do???\\" When I saw the video I gasped and thought that she was crazy!!! Listening to this album you get a totally different look at who Christina Aguilera really is. This album from the first listen picks you up and doesn't let you go. One of the many highlights(to me) in this album is the song \\"Walk Away\\". X-tina as she calls herself these days pours her heart out singing about her mistreatment and heartache. Another song which really gets to the listener is a song called \\"Beautiful\\". This song is like an anthem to let us all know that we are beautiful inside and we don't have to let anyone put us down or make us feel less.  In \\"I'm OK\\" Christina talks about the abusive situation that went on in her childhood. At the end of the song she says she's ok, but you get a hint that she really isn't. \\"The Voice Within\\" is a power-ballad song with a very strong message about believing in yourself and doing what makes you happy.  \\"Dirrty\\" is just one of those songs that grabs your attention, now that she has it she wants to let us know what she really is about and who she really is. She has placed her heart and soul on this album and left herself Stripped.  THE GENIE HAS BEEN RELEASED.
B000002UB3|5.0|I had this album on audio cassette and played it till it got worn out. When I purchased it again on Compact Disk I fell in love all over again. ... Just a Beatles Album where they finally grew up. Each song is fantastic and its great for early fans. To tell you the truth I was so sick of songs like Drive My Car, A Hard DAYS NIGHT, WITHIN WITHOUT YOU, and ugh! A DAY IN THE LIFE. This Album is modern and not dated plus and an awesome way to end the band for good. Side One is the album of six great songs. Side Two is (dare I say) The Beatle's first and only Rock Opera! Each song is a short story about several people starting from Here Come's The Sun, to Carry That Weight. It all comes together in The End and shows Beatle's way of saying bye bye. Her Majesty is a fun left over that was put there for kicks. Hey Good Idea! This album would be perfect if HEY JUDE was included as a bonus track!

At the end of the song she says she's ok, but you get a hint that she really isn't.  \\"Dirrty\\" is just one of those songs that grabs your attention, now that she has it she wants to let us know what she really is about and who she really is.  She has placed her heart and soul on this album and left herself Stripped. Enjoy the album 'cuz its a very good one.

B00005JKCH|1.0|Spider Man in one word: Hollywood shmaltz. Spider-Man is one of the most shallow, and lame, movies I have ever seen. The over-the-top CGI sequences are eye candy but ruin the illusion of realism. The movie would present a much more serious and mature movie if Spiderman didn't swing towards the camera on everyshot. The movie plays like a videogame and does not achieve any realism on any levels. The only good part of the movie was Tobey Maguire's stuttering persona, which is perfect for the part, and Willem Defoe's cackling laughter. The movie is classic Hollywood fluff, a fun but forgettable movie. It isn't a patch on X-Men or Batman.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This summer I watched the scratchy, almost-ten-years-old tapes of My-So Called Life that I made off of the reruns MTV played of it.  I got sucked back in all over again, despite the fact that the tapes skipped and the audio quality was horrible.  Then when I was done, I wrote in my journal, \\"I really want to know who Angela Chase became.  She's me- she's a whole generation of me's at 15.  Would she be us at 22?\\"<br />We'll never know for sure, but at least I can finally see it the way it originally aired- able to hear Jordan's song without it warbling, able to watch all the multitude of times that Angela cried, able to be sent back in time to when Rayanne's outfits were actually kind of cool.    <br />I will be the first person in line to buy this on November 19.

B00003E4DT|2.0|This 55 minute documentary was produced without consent of the band, its management, or their record company. Because of this, it is ALL interview and contains no background music nor live clips (contractual reasons I assume). <br />The bulk of this tape is comprised of large chunks of a wonderful documentary (Omnibus, BBC) aired in November of 1994. The other bits and pieces are of varying quality giving this tape more of a bootleg feel.<br />If you're a Floyd fan you'll find something of interest here and there, but if you can, track down the Omnibus special. It's widely available in most bootleg circles and is FAR superior to this tape.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia is of course a remake of a Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard, directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg in 1997 but as much as this may make me a heathen to European film culture, I must confess to having never seen the original. However, thanks to one of my good friends (Steve, take a bow) I was lucky enough to see the UK premier of Insomnia as the closing movie of the 2002 Edinburgh film festival and lucky enough to see and hear the Director Christopher Nolan say a few words about this fine movie. <BR> <BR>Opening with incredibly stunning cinematography of Alaskan ice fields, haggard L.A police detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hep Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in America's most northerly city to help solve the brutal killing of a teenage girl. Met by a local Detective (Hilary Swank) who openly hero-worships Dormer and his successful career as a Detective, Pacino's character sets about showing the local hicks how it's done. However, it soon transpires that Dormer is only in Alaska in the first place to avoid an ongoing criminal investigation by police Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles and it is not long before his investigation into the Alaskan girl's murder goes horribly wrong. Troubled by his conscience and the never-ending daylight of an Alaskan summer Dormer prays for sleep.<br />For many people that have seen either of Christopher Nolan's previous two movies (Following and Memento) Insomnia may seem like an odd choice; it's a `mainstream' Hollywood movie (Warner Brothers studio), it is told in a linear timeframe and it's a remake. However, there must have been obvious attractions apart from the budget and his paycheck. First off, Stephen Soderbergh, who successfully makes mainstream movies with an Indie heart, oversaw production and secondly there was the chance to work with great actors such as Pacino, Swank and Robin Williams, although at this point I have to add that I believe Williams was totally miscast and made an unconvincingvillain.<br />There are some wonderful scenes in this movie, including a nightmare like chase over hundreds of floating logs and the hunt for the killer in a freezing fog. It is also a movie that allows it's stars to shine and this is undoubtedly Pacino's best role (and best movie for many a year) and it is a pleasant change to see him with a decent script in an intelligent movie instead of hamming it up in the likes of The Devil's Advocate, alongside walking surfboard Keanu Reeves. This movie will also undoubtedly and deservedly enhance the careers and reputations of both Director Christopher Nolan and Hilary Swank, who both produce work of depth and subtlety. However, I also feel that much of the credit for what is a beautiful photographed and well-written movie should go to Wally Pfister and (for what is an excellent adapted screenplay) to Hilary Seitz. Insomnia is an excellent movie made by a very modest, very talented young British movie Director. Be warned though, you probably need an IQ to fully appreciate it.
B000024D4R|5.0|If Wish You Were Here is an internal cry of disconnected sorrow, then Animals is a caustic scream of venomous rage. This often-overlooked masterpiece was yet another leap forward for Pink Floyd. Coming off the bleak sad beauty of Wish You Were Here, the band lashed out with an edgier more aggressive sound to match Waters' vicious lyrical attack. The result was three brilliant sprawling tracks of anger and frustration sandwiched between two intimate acoustic moments of optimism.<br />Animals represents Waters' view of the avarice in modern society that divides people, creating the harsh, cold, uncaring environment in which he feels we live. His Orwellian world is broken down into three basic types: pigs (those who have and hold control with a self-consumed greed); dogs (who aspire to \\"pig status\\" and forsake everything and everyone in order to gain it); and sheep (the mindless masses who quietly accept all that is thrust upon them). Though a knee-jerk reaction is to view this work as a statement against capitalism, it would be more accurate to say this as an attack on anti-humanism.  The subjects in Roger's lyrics are belittled for their pursuit of self-serving agendas at the expense of all else. The basic human needs of connection and understanding should not be compromised. This is clearly illustrated in the album's opener and closer, Pigs On The Wing, and is an obvious undercurrent in all of Roger's work.<br />As is typical of Pink Floyd, the band's music compliments and lifts Waters' poignant lyrics, painting images that words alone could never do. David Gilmour in particular shines throughout, showcasing his incredible guitar mastery in all its passionate glory in several very spectacular guitar solos. Richard Wright's keyboards are both fiery and surreal, creating a chilling feel of unease in many spots to underscore Roger's lyrical intent. Nick Mason's ever-mindful focus on dynamics proves why he is the consummate drummer. His galloping attack in the first andfinal sections of Dogs seems to spur Gilmour on, as Dave unleashes his stinging, gnashing guitar to dramatic effect. Roger Waters works his bass as sympathetically as Mason does his drums, creating funky pulses and palpitating rhythms, as well as adding to the harmonic alchemy. Throughout the entire album, lead vocals are sung almost exclusively by Waters who rises to the challenge with his inimitable style, injecting the lyrics with just the right amounts of bile and venom. The only exception is Dogs, where the lead vocal is split between Gilmour and Waters, Dave taking the first half and Roger the second. The Timbre on Dave's voice is akin to that of the vocal he laid down for Money, and remains one of my favorites performed by him. In my opinion, the music on this album contains every element that makes Pink Floyd, PINK FLOYD: It is dynamic, dramatic, moody, powerful, and very visual. This is illustrated best, I think, in Dogs, an epic song of uncompromising brilliance that surely stands as one of Pink Floyd's greatest and most ambitious creations. During one section, a dark moody atmosphere is created perfectly with Gilmour strumming a lonesome acoustic as dogs can be heard in the distance, barking and howling in the moonlight. Suddenly, a snap of Mason's snare ignites Gilmour into a torturously aching solo coaxed from his Custom Telecaster. It is truly a moment that could only be created by Pink Floyd. And that is just one highlight of many. Check out the middle section of Pigs (Three Different Ones) where real pig noises, embellished with a vocoder, are joined with Dave mimicking pig grunts and squeals on his guitar courtesy of a talkbox. This is nothing, however, compared to his spectacularly climactic guitar solo at the song's end. Unison bends climb the fretboard; notes stagger and sputter; bends scream and cry as Dave punishes his guitar, climaxing with a series of rapid-fire triplets during the fadeout. I could go on, but I've yammered on enough!<br />This is a brilliant, BRILLIANT album. I suppose it is often overlooked due in large part to the non-radio-friendly structure of the songs. Most of the general public has never heard a single note, and this is a shame. Animals remains the most underrated of all of Pink Floyd's work. It stands as one of the four primary albums from their golden era and is an absolutely essential piece of music history.
B00005JL2O|3.0|So here it is the third instalment in one of the most popular and successful movie comedy franchises ever, Austin Powers in Goldmember, the follow up to the immensely popular and successful Spy Who Shagged Me. With Mike Myers reprising his role as writer/star, Beyonce Knowles as the new Powers girl and a cast which includes many of the biggest hitters in Hollywood, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, John Travolta, Britney Spears, Danny Devito and Michael Caine (an inspired choice as Austin's father) this promised to be the funniest movie of the summer. However, rather than building upon The Spy Who Shagged Me, Goldmember is instead a collection of hit and miss sketches, several of which are pale imitations of his last movie, loosely connected into some kind of story.<br />Opening with an action-packed pre-credit James Bond like sequence, with cameos from many of Hollywood's biggest stars gets the movie off to a funny if somewhat irrelevant start, which is great if you like movies within movies, not so great if you don't. From there we get back into the real action with Dr Evil and Myer's latest character Goldmember (a Dutchman with a gold penis and bad skin, which he likes to eat) plotting once more to take over the world. So far so good you might think but herein one of the problems lies: the character Goldmember just isn't funny and is positively poor next to all of Mike Myers other characters, including a disappointingly under-used and very flatulent Fat Bastard who makes a welcome but all too brief return. There are some very funny visual and verbal gags of course and a few clever scenes that retrace Austin Powers and Dr Evil's childhoods but all in all there are just as many hits as misses and too many scenes that are obvious retreads of the previous movies most successful gags, such as the use of silhouettes, telling Sean to zip-it and the Jay-Z \\"It's A Hard Knock Life\\" routine. Okay so these scenes are still, to an extent, funny but nowhere near as funny as the first time you saw them.<br />As for the cast, Myer's is his usual brilliant comedic self, it's just that his self-penned lines are not as good as before. Verne Troyer is once again splendid as Mini Me and Destiny's child's Beyonce Knowles makes a sassy and sexy Foxy Cleopatra, whilst Seth Green (sporting a receding hairline) is quite fabulous as Dr Evil's son Sean. However, the star of the show in my view, is Michael Caine, with a marvellous comedic performance as Austin's father Nigel, delightfully sending up his Harry Palmer persona from the 1960's movies that first made him a star.<br />  As for the movie as a whole, it is probably ideally suited to the DVD format more than any other movie out there, because on DVD you will be able to pick and choose which scenes you watch (and there are some very funny and very imaginative scenes). It is just that all n all you feel that you've seen it all before and seen it done better in the previous instalment. What is more the ending of the film suggests that not only is Mike Myers running out of new ideas for his spoof spy movies but that indeed it may be the end of this very profitable franchise. Still funny but not as funny as its predecessor: Three and a half stars.funny but nowhere near as funny as the first time you saw them. <br />As for the cast, Myer's is his usual brilliant comedic self, it's just that his self-penned lines are not as good as before.

630025075X|5.0|David Gilmour is without question one of the most brilliant and innovative guitarists the world of music has ever seen. His incredibly melodic, devastatingly passionate guitar work places him at the top alongside such greats as Jeff Beck, Robin Trower, and Jimi Hendrix. This concert video, filmed at the Hammersmith Odeon during his About Face Tour in 1984, showcases some of this brilliance.<br />The live portion of this film runs for about an hour and the set list includes: Until We Sleep - All Lovers Are Deranged - There's No Way Out Of Here - Short And Sweet - Run Like Hell - Out Of The Blue - Blue Light - Murder - and Comfortably Numb (as an encore with Mason on drums). What was wonderful about this tour (I was fortunate enough to have seen it live) was that it was very stripped down in terms of visuals...in fact there are barely any at all. This allowed David and the band to stretch out and jam when the mood hit. The only drawback I can think of is they didn't give us the full show. There were several numbers (Mahalis; Let's Get Metaphysical; You Know I'm Right; Money; etc) where Gilmour absolutely burned, and not including them is a complete shame.  Nonetheless there are many highlights for Gilmour fans to drool over (check out Murder where Mick Ralphs is steamrollered by Dave in the outro solos! It's like a Volkswagon facing off with a Sherman Tank!)<br />The live performance is followed by two conceptual videos for Blue Light and All Lovers Are Deranged. These were done in a typical 80's fashion and are quite entertaining.<br />The last segment is a 30 minute behind-the-scenes piece of Dave on tour. This includes comments on his playing by Nick Mason and Pete Townsend. (There's also an amusing bit where the tour bus driver admits he plays guitar himself and claims to attempt to emulate Dave \\"without too much success\\". This comment is immediately followed by a clip of Gilmour ripping through the solo of All Lovers Are Deranged).<br />Keep in mind I am a guitarfreak and a HUGE Gilmour fan. If you're more into the visual aspect of Pink Floyd you may not enjoy this as much. But if you love music, and love guitar, I suggest you try it out. (Now if we could just get this released on DVD!!)
0425170349|3.0|In Rainbow Six the reader once again meets Clancys other main character, John Clark.  In Rainbow Six Clark is much older than he was in Without Remorse, and he now heads a secret, international, anti-terrorism coalition called Rainbow Six.  The purpose of Rainbow Six is to fight terrorism, wherever it may occur, with soldiers of many nations.  The men and women of the Rainbow Six task force are from all over the world, and each one brings a specialty to the team.  <BR>Throughout the course of the book the reader follows the team as they respond to a strange, increased presence, of terrorism across the globe.  And as to what is really going on, it is only a matter of time until our heroes find out and come to save the world in the nick of time.   <BR>The plot of this book, while entertaining, is laughable at times and seems like something straight out of a James Bond movie.  And, as a previous reviewer stated below, may be a little offensive to the people of GreenPeace and other environmental protection groups.  But given the fact that it is very entertaining, and done well, I consider it worth checking out if youre a Clancy fan.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This cd which I'm sure many have been waiting for for quite some time, was well worth the wait. Featuring songs from each of their great albums, the voice of Kurt Cobain is heard as a consecutive piece of music. \\"You Know You're Right\\" is definitly a highlight of the album. Well take my advice and buy this as soon as u can.
B00006LLNU|4.0|i was and am still a huge agaetis byrjun fan, and have listened to that cd regularly for over a year.

B00006JL1Z|2.0|I don't blame the other reviewers for gushing over this collection, which is fine if the only Fleetwood Mac songs you like come from Nicks-Buckingham and later periods, but any &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection of this band that omits selections from the Welch period (Such as &quot;Hypnotized&quot;) isn't going to win many stars from me.  I'm sticking with the box set &quot;The Chain&quot; which unfortunately isn't easy to find anymore but which is the REAL five star greatest hits collection of this fine band.

B00003CXSP|4.0|as a whole, it's a good flick, but I was terribly dissapointed in how much it strayed from the book. I mean, I know every movie strays from it's book, even the 1st Harry Potter flick (contrary to the belief of most), but I feel they cut out some of the key points of the story in the movie. Remember how Clarice and Hannibal were lovers at the end of the book? Not so at the end of the movie. All through the book/movie it's obvious how Hannibal has such an admiration for Clarice, and Clarice holds a certain distant respect and reverance for the good ole doc, and it's so obvious these two will hook up. This gives strength to just how personal this case is for Clarice. This personal sense is most prevalent when she decides to continue the case \\"against\\" the good doctor after being placed on administrative leave. And she gets arrested at the end?! That's not right. That soooo did not happen in the book. And whatever happenned to Mason's sister? Margot, I think her name was? She played a short, albeit important role in the book, and she is just not in the movie at all. In the movie it's obvious that Mason's staff doesn't exactly like the [person], and I think that if they'd left the sister in, and gave an accurate portrayal of her teaming up with Barney, ultimately causing his death, then they'd have done a better job of showing how Mason's \\"dictatorship\\" lead to a revolt, resulting in his demise. Sure, feed him to the pigs. That makes no sense. Maybe they left some key points out of the movie to make room for the slow-starting beginning. The director really, really let us down on this one folks; that is such an injustice. To tell you the truth, though, I feel that Thomas Harris could have completely left out the Evelda Drumgo bit, and just started with the Xray arrival. But, that's one person's opinion.
B000069AT7|5.0|I never saw the cgi enhanced version of ET until I bought the Ultimate Gift Boxed Set because I was stubborn and believed that ET should have been left alone in it's original theatrical format-I was wrong. I am one of many who is tired of Hollywood trying to make everything politically correct nowadays and was sick to hear that ET was going to fall victim to it's influence. While it is true that the government officials firearms were cgi replaced with radios, I didn't really notice because the film's magic worked anyway. In the 2002 version we find ET much more agile than we were led to believe in the opening sequence when he is trying to escape the authorities, running and jumping like a forest animal. There is an added scene with ET in the bathroom and cgi enhanced effects are added to the starship's engines when it takes off. All in all, the cgi effects were perfectly executed and looked as real as you can get. <BR>The Ultimate Box set also includes the original version which was the only way to get it, unfortunately. But it also includes a fourth disc (CD) of John Williams soundtrack and a bonus DVD full of extras. There is a hard cover book of ET, from concept to classic, with extras in it as well as a collectible senitype from a scene in the film. Considering all this the price wasn't bad at all, especially since I got it for about [$] less than the suggested retail price! But if you don't want to spend the money or if you feel that you may be missing something if you don't get the original version, put your fears to rest. MY family and I enjoyed the remastered version as much as the original and I wouldn't have missed a thing if I didn't purchase the box set only for the 1982 version. The film is still a beautifully put together work of art no matter which version you watch. 1982 or 2002, go ahead and get either one!
B00005KHKX|5.0|Playwright Anthony Shaffer's deftly plotted town-with-a-secret plot is genuinely intelligent and suspenceful.  It's built on solid philosophical conflicts: i.e. Christianity vs. paganism, piety vs. lust, reason vs. revelry.  Scottish policeman Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) flies to remote Summerisle to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl.  Modishly coifed Christopher Lee is the laird of the island.  Everything Howie finds challenges his strong religious beliefs in ways that neither he - nor the viewer - could have anticipated.  Director Robin Hardy combines plain everyday realism with dream-like hallucinatory images.  Woodward's stiff-backed performance gives his role the gravity and authority that the film needs to work. And it does work. Wonderfully. Be SURE the video version is the full 103 minutes.
B00006HBUB|3.0|First, a word on the cast.  I must agree with the reviewer who said that the characters were generally well-cast. Though I'm not familiar with the work of Freddie Prinze, Jr. outside of SD, he did a respectable job.  Like the Trekkers before her, I fear that Sarah Michelle Gellar will forever be Buffy. Nuff said.  I was also unfamiliar with the work of Linda Cardellini, but she nailed the part of Velma. A true joy to watch.  Scooby was well done, and belivable within reason.  Finally, Matthew Lillard simply stole the show as Shaggy.  Nice to know that someone is carrying on the fine work started by Casey Kasem.<br />The plot was the distraction for me.  As an \\"old school\\" SD fan, I've been somewhat disappointed in the trend of the recent animated films and this live action go.  Seeing the bad guy unmasked at the end of the day is more difficult than saying that there truly were supernatural forces at work.  The film certainly had its fair share of \\"classic\\" moments, though I could have done without one particular aspect.  If you've seen the film, you know where I'm going.  Anyway...  A pleasant diversion, but more a rental than a keeper.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I waited over three years for this unhumanly talented girl's next full length album.  Now, finally, today it came - and I bought it as soon as I got over to the store. I kind of didn't know what to expect! it's awesome though!  .. quite a variety of songs. rocked out ones, r&amp;b ones - Christina never seems to stay in one territory but no matter what the case, she has the best voice of all singers out there. I recommend this CD to ANYONE.  Might I add Christina wrote all these songs, so nobody can have THAT against her anymore...
B00006CXXU|5.0|i love this album! i first heard dirrty and loved it! she has matured so much from her genie in a bottle blonde pop bubblegum image and in my opinion 4 the better!  i loved her 1st album (more so the singles) but with this one its such a deep and personal portrayal of her life and how shes grown and matured as a person. there isnt a song on the album that is reminiscent of dirrty, their all completley different. christina has an amazing voice the songs are raw and edgy but her voice has a strong impact and i think this album displays her voice and talent much more. she co wrote and produced nearly all the songs on the album so they are personal and heartfelt. im a fan of britney and nsync and justin and alicia and things like this, but her voice is amazing , im not too keen on her image @ the mo , but she is a very beautiful person and thru listenin to the album u find out she is inside and out its very inspiring and she touched a nerve with me as the things shes describing and saying sre so relevant to me i connect with her and understand wot she means.i'll give u a full track review! track 1 stripped intro- i love it!! it feats fred durst , carson daly, and her, and its a gud insight to wots to come on the album! its very clever and ties in with track2, which is cant hold me down, i love this its an anthem 4 the girls! it gets u goin, its got a guf pumpy beat and is tellin the world the truth about woman and the way any man has ever done u wrong to stand up to urself and b strong. track 3  is walk away, i love it the words are so pretty and they sound as if they came from the heart. track 4 is fighter this is the big mena number where she tells us how strong shes become and instead of lowering down to the bullys whove sed nasty things to them! she thanx then! can u believ as theyve made her stronger! more power to u girl! track 5 is an interlude and u get to hear her speak spanish! track 6 is infatuation this is more poppy and more reminiscent of her previous workbut its gud as it shows her latin roots and gets u dancin! track 7 a lil interlude, nothin special but very pretty sounding it s kinda an intro to trak 8 , which i love its called lovin me 4 me, its about how sum1 loves u 4 who u r, its lovely and it seems such a lovely thing to achieve. track 8 impossible written by alicia keys!!! im a fan of hers and u can inda tell its one of her songs but xtina sings it well and does it justice its gud to c artists wrkin together. track  9 is called under appreciated, sumthing all girls can relate to! i love the little bridge bit @ the end, her voice sounds cool, i think its really gud she can sound so many diff ways, she has variety and her talent seems to have gotten stronger. beautiful track 10 was written by linda perry and its a stand out track, it gives a gud msge of how every1 is beautiful no matter wot ppl say! track 11 make over by linda perry too!

0385484518|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I have two children under the age of two and I found time to read this book in two days.  As Mitch Albom writes, you can visualize yourself sitting with Morrie in his study talking about family, money, culture, etc.  I found Morrie Schwartz to be a remarkable man, he certainly does make one look inside themselves and take a good, hard look.  I would recommend this book 100 times over, I simply can't rave enough about Tuesdays with Morrie.
B000031WD8|4.0|American Pie, which was released in 1999, is a wonderful depiction of youth culture today. Four friends (Jim, Kevin, Finch, and Oz) have begun to feel the pressure from society to become \\"men.\\" They make a pact to have sex before their high school graduation. Deciding that the prom is their best chance to score (since most teens feel that having sex is a part of the prom experience) they pick their dates and prepare for the big night. When prom night finally arrives, the teens decide that having sex doesn't define them. It won't make them \\"men\\" and it will not make an impact on their social lives. <BR> While some aspects of the movie are unrealistic (ie. the pact itself) as a whole this is an accurate representation of teenage life. Young adults are constantly bombarded with images of sex and are told that it is for mature people. There is immense pressure to grow up fast, and kids now think that having sex is the way to do that. But American Pie sent a good message to them, showing them that yes, there is a sexual culture out there... but having sex completely your choice. Don't let society dictate your next move in life. The movie, even with its overwhelming use of sexual humor, uses old fashioned values to show the value and importance of sex. <BR> I highly recommend this movie. I enjoyed it a lot. It is very entertaining and better than a lot of other teen films that I have seen. It has a wonderful cast (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Eugene Levy, Mena Suvari, etc...), excellent humor, and delivers a good message to the audience in a subtle way. You will get so wrapped up in the plot and the development of the story that the ending is a great surprise. After all of the crazy things that happen to the characters (the pie, Nadia, etc...), in the end you say \\"Oh yeah... but it's not THAT important...\\"
0553260111|5.0|The Bourne identity is quite possibly Robert Ludlum's greatest work.  Ludlum exemplifies his genious in both the big picture and the small picture of his story.  He manipulates the reader through a terrifying amount of dizzying twists and turns that leaves the reader satisfied.  The dialog is written in such a human manner that the reader can easily relate to the characters in the story.<BR>   The story begins with a chilling account of a man being shot of the side of a boat during a storm in the Caribbean.  After native fisherman find him near-death, a curious but generous doctor performs surgery on him and helps him to recover.  When he awakens from his coma, he cannot remember anything about himself or his past life, including his own name.  However, the doctor removes a microfilm implanted in his leg that has a bank account number of a Swiss bank.  The man follows this lead.  When he arrives in Europe, however, he finds himself robbing innocent people at gunpoint in order to gain a few thousand dollars.  Because he is instictively doing this, he assumes that he is either a terrorist or an assassin.  The Swiss bank account contains the name \\"Jason Bourne,\\" as well as millions of dollars and a few weapons.  <BR>   Amidst Bourne's own confusion of finding out his own identity, he is being hunted by an Carlos the Jackel, a legendary assassin who knows his identity and will do anything to kill him.<BR>   Throughout the novel, Bourne is trying to escape American intelligence agents.  Without giving the story away, the agents mistake Bourne's actions as negative to them, and therefore they are trying to kill or capture him.<BR>   The only light in Jason Bourne's life is Marie.  Jason meets Marie by taking her hostage and ordering her at gunpoint to drive him out of the area.  She at first dismisses his story that he has amnesia as psycho-babble from the lunatic that he seemed to be, but later believed his story.  Marie turned out to be an accountant from Canada.  Marieprovided Bourne with money that he needed in order to dodge both Carlos and the CIA and to find out his true identity.
B000067CPX|3.0|I first got turned onto the peppers with Californication.  The songs were yes, mellow, but they had a lot of heart due to the fervor of reunification with long absent guitarist John Frusciante.  It was immediately in my top 10 all time favorite albums.  I soon delved into earlier work, found that I hated One Hot Minute, and loved just about everything else.  Naturally I was way psyched about By the Way.  With the exception of about four songs (By the way, The Zephyr Song, Can't Stop, and On Mercury), this album is passion-less and dull, the sound of way overly contrived songs.  I recommend the \\"Mother's Milk\\" album instead, way funkier, well produced, and it's on a creative high, the album just before Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  I'm still depressed that one of my favorite bands put out such a stunningly bland album after such a great one.  No grammy's here, I can promise you that.  Better luck next time guys, oh, and by the way, leave the synthesizer at home next time and bring flea's bass back to the forefront and you may recover the magical sound that propelled you to fame and won grammys.  Hopefully the peppers recover from this the same way they came out with One Hot Minute after Blood Sugar (by putting out Californication.)  Although, for some reason, I don't see a recovery in sight this time.  The critics loved this album.  They hated One Hot Minute, so the chilis might not feel a need to change.  That would ...  Then again that's really all you can say about the peppers and of life, the only thing guaranteed is change.
0316666343|3.0|It is a pretty good book but in my opinion it is to long and drawn out.  I don't have a lot of time to sit down and read a book.  I started reading this book because my teacher of my Literature class and some of the students in it recommended it.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Words cannot express how much I love this album. Lyrically it's the best U2 album ( see Discotheque, Staring at the Sun, Please, Gone, and If God Will Send His Angels) to the 1997 point in their career.  The songs all have PHATTY beats that won't stop.  It's hard to pick a favorite song.  Although currently it's the \\"unfinished\\" \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\"  which sees Bono and the boys waiting for the big guy to send his soldiers to earth as a remedy to how messed up everything is. Great lyrics- \\"the next minute you're blowing a fuse and the cartoon network turns into the news- If God Will Send His Angels, sure could use them here right now.\\"  Personally, I like this extended version a lot better than the \\"perfected\\" single version.  POP was a bit ahead of its time (typically U2) when released, but I think if it were re-released today, with proper editing, it would sell a lot more than in 1997, not that 8 million is bad.  Track number 11 (\\"please\\") on studio album 9 (pop) - 9/11, \\"please\\" contains these lyrics \\"September, streets capsizing, spilling over down the drain, shards of glass, splinters like rain, you could only feel your own pain, october, talk getting nowhere, november, december, remember, we just started again.\\"  If that ain't a prophecy I dunno what is.  So stop contemplating and go out and buy one of the most rewarding modern rock albums.  If you like \\"The Fly\\" on Achtung Baby, then you will feel like this album was made for you.  I just wish I would've been into U2 at the time this was released so I could've seen their greatest tour, POPMART, live.  BTW, down with the Joshua Tree, and long live POP!
B00006CXXU|5.0|OK, first off, I love Christina, so I was looking forward to this release no matter what. But in all honesty, this CD absolutely blew me away. I can't think of another CD that I have bought this year than can match it point-for-point in terms of artistry, writing, vocals, production or anything! This is a BAD-ASS disc!<BR>Christina is totally unleased here, tackling rock, jazzy soul and ballads. All of them are so well-crafted that it's hard to believe this is the same girl who did \\"What A Girl Wants.\\" The songs here are lightyears away from that record, in terms of not only the sound, but also the writing. Look for intensely personal songs that run the gamut from childhood trauma (\\"I'm OK\\") to feminism (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" with Lil' Kim (!!!)) to casual sex (\\"Get Mine Get Yours\\"). <BR>It's hard to write about this disc because it really defies categorization. It's rock at moments (the sizzling \\"Fighter\\") and R&B at others (the smash \\"Dirrty\\"), happy at some moments (\\"Soar\\") and pensive in others (\\"Beautiful,\\" a Beatles-eque anthemic ballad that is hauntingly, well, beautiful). <BR>The closest CD I can think of that parallels this disc is George Michael's Grammy-winning CD \\"Faith.\\" It's not because of the music; they are very different in that respect. But both are all over the map in terms of styles, both are the rebith of an artist exploring creative freedom, and both are super-well crafted.<BR>Add this to your library soon.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I gave this film the five star rating because it made me feel like a five year old again. Sometimes the effects were way too obvious. Sometimes the pacing left a bit to be desired. The ending confrontation is a let down. But, that Thanksgiving dinner? The first attack of the Goblin? Those dizzying sweeping web rides through NYC. The scene where Spidey dodges bullets? And, oh so important, Aunt May! Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben! I loved every second of this. Your children will love it, even if they are grown and they have your grandchildren. They'll love it too! This film is a wonderful start to what could easily be a ten year series of films, if done right. If they avoid the Superman trap and stick to the stories Stan Lee spun during the first fifty issues that displayed such growth and maturity that became as much a part of the tale as the super hero conflicts. And always, the presence of Aunt May looms large. Spidey's greatest feats were always in protection of Aunt May. You just knew in the movie when Aunt May was in trouble that all heck was about to break loose. Remember, don't [mess] with Aunt May. It will always get you a pounding from a super powered kid in a spider costume. Nuff said!
B000006045|5.0|amazing disc! sophisticated, intelligent music. when i blast this in my car i envision them in the studio. not that all good work by any band is not painstaking...but the complexity of this work is obvious and however enjoyable it was to make, it must also have been grueling. i realize that not every one will like this disc. it cant be placed neatly in any one slot. they have magnificently drawn on different genres. layering textures. rocking-clanging steel, acid trippy, arabic rhythms and sounds, hip hop recitings and beats, soulful r and b come jazz. theres an airy, floating quality here. also dissonant/minor key themes that keep this musc dark and rather gothic. this group is up there with portishead in nature. this is far from pop. it takes a certain ear to appreciate this music. perfect for my aquarian nature.let yourself go and meld into the realm that M.A. creates. this is hypnotic stuff. it just may draw you in and compell you to return to it as i do, over and over.
015626224X|5.0|Loved this book. Never read anything else by Orwell (not sure why), but the writing here is easy and unpretentious. Easy to relate as well, if you've ever been down and out, scraping bottom, desperate to make bills, etc. I read somewhere that Ernest Hemingway thought this was a terrific book (& that's high praise, I think). The writing here reminds me of Nelson Algren, Dan Fante's Spitting Off Tall Buildings, Charles Bukowski's Factotum, Kirk Alex'es Working the Hard Side of the Street, and some of the late John fante's novels--but keep in mind Mr. Orwell stays clear of sex and foul language, not that sex or foul language in a book ever bothered me (it all depends on the writer's style of putting the word down, etc.) In Orwell's case it just wasn't his way of doing things; plus you've got to remember this book was written way back in 1933--and yet, still holds up today! That tells you plenty. This is a fine work , a gem of a book.
B0000047EC|5.0|...Charlie Haden is my favorite acoustic bassist, and Pat Metheny my favorite Jazz guitarist. So imagine my surprise upon knowing they would do a duet cd!! They had recorded together before (\\"80/81\\") but never as a duo. This record is an absolute MASTERPIECE of musical dialogue of the deepest caliber. To me, this is as heavy as any death-metal record, but in a much more profound and emotional way (I mention that genre because it is one of my favorites, believe it or not). Man, what a ride! If you like to hear master musicians interact in improvistatory contexts, this is just that taken to its naked essence. The stripped-down format makes for an extremely intimate listening experience. I feel like I am there with them!! It is a great \\"labor of love\\" as Charlie himself puts it in the liner notes. Those who find it boring are missing out on an almost out-of-body musical experience. Too bad. Get this cd and be transported!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is really, really personal and was totally worth the three-year wait. She has a voice and knows how to use it, therefore, I would DEFINATELY recommend buying this album. This girl outshines Britney like the sun.  My favorite song is &quot;I'm Okay&quot; because it's a very beautiful and inspirational song.
B00000K19E|4.0|Interesting premise, well executed. Of course, if you don't know about THE MATRIX by now, you've probably been living in a cave, so we don't need to get into it.<br />However ... <br />While it's not the end all of science fiction films, it is entertaining, thoughtful when it has to be, and, as I already said, entertaining. It does what a movie should: keeps you interested.<br />And, it is one of the few films that has managed to survive Keanu Reeves's bad acting intact, and that says a lot.
B00003CXC6|5.0|This will be short and to the point- If you call yourself a movie fan than watch Rashomon. IT is a true example of pure cinema magic. You won't regret it!
0790734850|5.0|L.A. Confidential has everything! It's got murder, betrayal, drugs, a pinch of sex, great acting, awsome directing and screenplay, and a fantastic soundtrack. It is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time!<br /> L.A. Confidential takes you back to L.A. in the 1950's. It recreates the time period perfectly with the costumes, sets, and music. The story is extreamly complex with many twists and turns. It would be very hard to give you a specific plot; but it is basically about 3(very different)cops eventually coming to work together to figure out a huge scandal involving drugs, prostitution, and murder.<br /> The movies preformances are outstanding, especially Kim Basinger who recieved an Academy Award for Best Actress. She definatly deserved it. She plays an expensive prostitute made to look like Veronica Lake. Russel Crowe, Guy Pierce, and Kevin Spacey all give excellent preformances as the 3 cops.<br /> This movie is definatly worth seeing, especially if you liked the movie Chinatown or like Film Noir thrillers. This movie was nominated for Best Picture as well, even though it didn't officially win it, it won it in my book.
B000003TAR|5.0|And so, we have a sea of flowers and mirrors, reflecting in the fire of a guitar. The mirrors cut, turning the sea red as lava from the burned-out peak of Mt. St. Helens, Washington. A voice smears itself over the collapsing chaos and pulls from the deep red ocean soothing stones with irreadable, disquiet names -- bones of love to finger and display in homemade cases. A transfer of glue to wings, to bring the swollen remnants of flight to invisible verses. And so, we float away in purple storms, and the ocean has turned a new color of wombs.<br />-Michael Chmielecki (me)<br />This album is the reason to listen to music.
0671042858|5.0|I've been an avid reader of Stephen King's works for quite some time, reading everything of his I could get my hands on.  I stopped about 4 years ago, however, when it seemed that everything he wrote sounded alike.<br />I bought &quot;The Girl Who..&quot; on a whim; it was on clearance at a book store, and when I read it, I fell into it.  There was no stopping until I finished it.  I could almost hear the buzzing of the mosquitoes.<br />I recommend this book to absolutely anyone.  I think this was a very exploratory novel for King and he did a wonderful job of incorporating a simple lost-in-the-woods tale with a spiritual revolution for one young girl and many readers, I'm sure.<br />No, there is no gore, it won't haunt you at night, but it is worth reading, every word.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish for more, so you'll read it again.
B000002LUB|5.0|Alright I've heard a lot of good and bad (and mixed) reviews of this album so about two months ago I finally bought it. You know right off the bat with the opener \\"Computer God\\" it's going to be a heavy album. The second song, \\"After All (The Dead)\\" is probably one of Sabbath's heaviest songs ever, and to me, it sounds similiar to the track \\"Black Sabbath\\" from the band's debut album in 1970.<br />Dehumanizer doesn't sound very much like Heaven & Hell, or Mob Rules, which are two other Sabbath albums Dio has performed on. And it doesn't sound like his solo works either (his solo works tend to favor awesome keyboard lines, Dehumanizer has an almost complete absence of keyboards.) There are no instant hits on Dehumanizer, but I think every song shines in its own right. Some of the standout tracks inlude \\"Master of Reality\\" and \\"I\\" - the Wayne's World version of \\"Time Machine\\" is also much more refined the original. I'm not very fond of the song \\"T.V. Crimes,\\" though it was a Top 30 hit in the U.K.<br />Overall every song on Dehumanizer rocks, and it's well worth the money. If you don't like your heavy metal really heavy, than this isn't for you, but if you're fan of Dio, or Sabbath in general, or just want an album that rocks get Dehumanizer. I'm sure you'll be cranking it up and head-banging in no time at all!

B00006CXXU|5.0|christina's sophomore cd is all that i expected and so much more.  she's really developed her own sound and the lyrics in this album delves deep into her life and not only gives inspiration to the listener, but lifts them up as well.  what i truly enjoyed were the soulful, rich ballads -- among my favorites were beautiful, soar, and the voice within.  each and every song has meaning to it and reflects well on who the real christina is.  i'm sure you won't be disappointed with this cd and enjoy it just as much as i did...if not more.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is one of the most talented and upcoming artist in this day and age. She is a talented young woman who sings about what she knows. Comparing her to Britney or Christina is riduculous. Is the reason most people dont like her, simply the fact that she is not strutting around naked on her film clips,does not have anorexic bimbos dancing around her, or the fact that she is talented enough to write her own songs.<BR>Avril's music i have found touches people (i have to say that even my fiance thinks that she rocks)i have found numerous people that love her and people that will listen to her but no one that dispises her. When i have kids i hope that the grow up to be like Avril, she sings from the heart, has such passion and doesnt feel the need to flaunt bare skin in her filmclips to stay in the charts. This young woman has spunk, she appears to be street smart and does not make out that life is all peachy keen. People that dont like her thats fine but just because you dont like her dont bad mouth her. There are lots of people out there like Michelle Branch, Pink, lifehouse etc who are praised solely for the musical talents why not praise Avril for them aswell. Avril is original, she wears what she wants, sings what she knows and is a real person,a real performer, not a sex show with song.
B00005JKJA|3.0|First, let me say that this is truly an amazing film, unquestionably the best thing that David Lynch has ever done.  I give the movie five stars plus.  But if you are buying this DVD in order to dissect this complex work, BEWARE--there is no Scene Select feature!!!!  This is the ONLY DVD I have ever purchased where it is IMPOSSIBLE to jump to a particular scene on an ordinary DVD player--if you wanna watch this, you've got to start at the beginning and go to the end.  I expect a certain perverse quality in anything associated with David Lynch, but this is TRULY ANNOYING.
B00005A0RI|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful &quot;albums&quot; I own.  NEVER does it fail to put me in a good place of reverie and mellowness.  There is nothing more to say.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is the best CD ever, while pop singers sing about boys and love, Christina sings about realistic problems especially in the very haunting, &quot;I'm OK&quot; and the song that I have always felt should have been made about the double standards of women &quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot;. I also love &quot;Keep Singing my Song&quot; or something like that. Best CD ever. I can't stop listening to it! <br />I also LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the song, &quot;Beautiful&quot;. Christina's vocal talents rocked out big time in that song!
B00005JK8K|3.0|Director John Woo knows how to best utilize actor Nicolas Cage, having worked with him in FACE/OFF; you give him very little dialogue. Cage does a great job playing a taciturn shell of a man, and he is very comfortable with the action scenes. Woo's epic-scale battle scenes are very well staged, full of roving dolly and crane shots swinging across a vast panorama of blood, steaming steel on mortar, tank, and artillary; flashing swords, bayonets and hunting knives, and the rolling red-orange fire clouds of huge explosions. Most of the action takes place on the home island of Saipan, with the Japanese troops dug in; tenacious frenzied fanatics. But the Japanese are shown as poor shots, easily duped, and easily defeated in hand-to-hand combat. They are slaughtered wholesale like cardboard cut-outs in a shooting range; kind of like the Indians in all those John Ford westerns; nearly faceless and soulless.<br />The writing by John Rice and Joe Batteer is two-dimensional at best. The primary weakness of the script is that after finding the fabulous hook, the little known story of the Navajo code-talkers, they do not fully explore it. Some critics were unhappy with the Monument Valley prologue and epilogue, but actually they perfectly frame the training and battle scenes. Oddly, these early and late scenes seem to breathe in the world of 1944. They have nice texture, and a feel for the '40's. The rest of the film seems too contemporary. We know that our boys are fighting the Japanese, but it easily could have been the N.Koreans, or the N.Vietnamese.<br />A good troupe of actors struggled with the shallow script. Nicolas Cage is very effective as the shell-shocked neurotic tortured Joe Enders. He spends a lot of time clicking his zippo lighter, smoking, and staring sad-eyed out into space; and it works for his character. Adam Beach, a veteran of several films about Native Americans, is excellent as Ben Yahzee. Yes, he smiles a lot, but never as a dolt; always from the heart, never insincere. He was a good man, who would transcend into a better man through the bloody cauldron of battle, through watching his friends die, through the killing of others. Roger Willie, as his buddy Charlie Whitehorse, who is a real Navajo, debuted in this film, and he made a solid impact. Again, this film missed out on \\"classic\\" status, because not enough time was given to these Indian characters. Cage's character becomes the Sgt. Rock of the piece, and instead Enders needed to be more peripheral, more secondary. Artistically, this did not need to be a Nicolas Cage picture. Of course, financially, I'm sure it was a different story. The movie would have soared if the Navajos had had more of the focus.<br />Francis O'Conner, as the sympathetic nurse love-interest for Cage was gratuitous and wasted; a good actress tossed aside by poor plotting. Christian Slater as Pete \\"Ox\\" Anderson, found some effective screen time; breathing life into his cliche role; creating good moments out of nothing. His harmonica duets with Whitehorse's Indian flute could have been a much stronger motif, but it was handled poorly, and it got lost in the din, drown out by the staccato of machine guns. Peter Stormare, wild-eyed and thick-accented, found the pulse of his character, squad leader Sgt. Gunny Hjelmstad.<br />One of the major plot twists involved orders to kill the Navajos rather than let them be captured, and possibly compromise the code. This could have been the stuff of drama, but it never really jelled. And why were these two valuable Windtalkers put in harm's way in the first place ? The film could have been much more powerful if we had known more about, and cared more about the Indian characters. Even the cliches regarding racism would have been better served if we had seen more of the story from the Navajo perspective.<br />Perhaps some day, the Navajo's story will be more accurately depicted. It surely is a story worth telling. That story was only hinted at, and glossedover within this film. But despite the rough edges, this movie packed a solid punch, and it stirred the blood to sit through it. It is an above average WWII war movie, and it is well worth the viewing.ossed over within this film.

0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold <br />Usually, one reads a book that is narrated by a character while events are happening. Other times we are seeing things as they happened years ago, and the narrator is telling the story in flashbacks.  And usually, this narrator is alive.  In THE LOVELY BONES, Alice Sebold uses a different technique.  The opening page reveals that the main character Susie Salmon was murdered on December 6, 1973, and is narrating her account of her own murder and what happens afterwards, as she sits and continues her \\"life\\" in heaven. She was 14 years old at the time of her death.<br />The book starts with Susie describing in detail her rape and murder.  The reader knows immediately who raped and killed Susie. It is a neighbor, Mr. Harvey, who always seemed harmless enough but was a little bit \\"off\\". During a cold snowy night, Susie is persuaded to follow Mr. Harvey into an underground shelter that he had built.  She says \\"I wish now that I had known this was weird\\", and goes into her feelings of hindsight, of how she should have known this was not normal, that she was in danger, but looking back she knew that she did not have a chance to escape.  She was only 14 years old and too small to have fought him off.<br />We see every little detail from Susie's point of view.  Only the reader knows what really happened to Susie.  There are no witnesses, and later, there is no body to be found.  Mr. Harvey, as the reader learns, did a thorough job of disposing all body parts so that no one would be able to find Susie or point to him as a possible suspect.<br />THE LOVELY BONES is a \\"whodunit\\" in reverse.  While we know who murdered Susie and how it was done, the \\"fun\\" part is watching the rest of the world solve the murder mystery.  On another level, THE LOVELY BONES is the story of how Susie's loved ones cope and deal with the tragic loss of a loved one.  We see how it changes and shapes her remaining siblings, one of whom was too young even to understand what death was all about.  We see how her friends and family move on, and how some of them cannot deal with her death, choosing to live in denial and run away.<br />After reading this book, I whole-heartedly agree with the many booklists that have officially proclaimed THE LOVELY BONES one of the best books of 2002.  It is one of those books that will be remembered not only for the story, but also for the way the story was told.  Alice Sebold did a remarkable job of telling the tale of murder and how it effects those that are left behind.
0790729628|4.0|The Bladerunner future, that may be ours: the endless darkness and rain caused by climate change, the squalor, the poverty, the glitzy commercialism, the airships encouraing bottom dwellers to migrate to the \\"outworld\\", the out of control soldier androids.  <br />Bladerunner is probably the most prophetic and underrated science fiction movie of the last twenty years. Defying movie goers expectations set at the time by the likes of Star Wars, Bladerunner is a dark, moody, sexy and cerebral science fiction fantasy set in a grim rundown future, where there are no clear Darth Vadars and Luke Skywalkers to scream a moral compass. <br />Consequently it did not do well in dawn of the new patriotism / feel good Reagan era in which it was released. But as the years go by it sparkles as near visionary, and certainly mythic in proportions. Truly Ridley Scott (of \\"Aliens\\" fame and most recently, \\"Gladitor\\") delivers his first masterpiece. <br />Enjoy the endless rain and darkness of a future Los Angeles, in the seedy future as Harrison Ford, putative hero is sent to track down a band of renegade androids who refuse to die as programmed.  The dark flame shot city is so realistic you would swear it was done with computers, but no, this was renedred the old fashioned way with models and has yet to be bested, in my view.<br />Needlesss to say, the androids, although violent and confused finally develo more humanity than their creators in the ultimate Pinochio metaphor, and restore what is left of that in the bounty hunter Ford. Yet in the cruelest twist of all, Ford comes to question whether he is a human at all, or does  he? You decide. <br />This director's cut does not add much to the original movie in footage length, indeed there are no new scenes. But it is what it loses that is key, the awful Harrison Ford voice over, meant to mimic the success of that found in \\"Apocalypse Now\\", is gone, trusting the viewer's intelligence to divine the plot and meaning.  The uneccessary tacked on \\"flying away from the city\\" ending spelling out the future of the possibly doomed heroes, and \\"explaining\\" what just happened, is also gone, as it was foisted on Scott by a baffled studio.<br />(Interestingly, the Rockies type landscape that Ford was apparently flying over in the chopeed ending, was actually spare footage of the rockies from Kubrick's \\"the Shining,\\" Kubrick was a freind of Scott.)<br />We recently learned from Scott that the final soliloquy of the Android leader, played by Rutger Hauer in his best role, was rewritten and reduced by Hauer at the last minute, as the studio goons waited to pull the plug on what they regarded as on over budget, doomed affair.  It was done in one take, and sounds like Shakespeare.<br />Its a crisp, clean print and the wonderful Vangelis soundtrack glows in this restored version. A classic movie of all time, buy this, you will watch it over and over and see nuances you never saw before.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Nearly anyone already a fan of Sigur Ros will love this newest CD: unique, emotional, and beautiful, as we all have come to know Sigur Ros to be. On a fan site (sorry, I forget the URL), someone made the point that Sigur Ros aren't really the &quot;saviors of rock&quot; (keep reading, I'm not putting S.R. down), because of how unique they are, saying that they're in a category of their own. If that's the case with Agaetis Byrjun, this CD further supports the notion that they've founded themselves on something completely different. And like other great bands across the board, they communicate through music in a way that genuinely touches us. This CD is no exception. It's definitely worth owning, and will very frequently be in my playlists. And to contradict the editorial review, they aren't trying to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;. Trying to apply that to Sigur Ros is like saying that Jimi Hendrix was repetitive because he kept playing with a Fender. Point is, this is their style. This is the way they play; it's their music. It's quite dynamic, and quite addictive to listen to. But to emphasize what the reviews also said, this CD is definitely worth getting. And years on down the line, it will still be as enchanting as ever.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's Sophmore Album Stripped is awesome. If you werent a fan of her's, then BUY this album and you will be. She Puts her heart and soul into this album and it surely paid off, and was worth the wait. She Has surely grown up and has expressed that in her music. With this album she has many different Generes of music. From Rock, pop, R&B, and some Hip hop flava that sets her Far apart from the rest. Of course you know she can sing but her voice is so strong in songs like \\"A voice within\\", The Jazzy R&B \\"Impossible\\", and the power ballad \\"Soar\\". She also has some Hip hop flava  on tracks like Her Controversial first single \\"Dirrty\\" feat. Redman, and The Women's Anthem \\"Can't hold us down\\" feat.Lil Kim. She ventures into Rock with Songs like \\"Fighter\\" feat.Dave navarro, \\"Cruz\\", And some in Her NEW Single \\"Beautiful\\" which is very insperatonal because it talks about how everybody is beautiful no matter what people say. Every song on the album is worth Listeing to. If i was to give Stripped a grade it would have to be an \\"A\\" By far the Album of the Year. Not only showing the haters out their what she's made of, but finally getting to express the real her for the first time.
B00005U2JL|4.0|This dvd is rather good, and instead of showing one straight show, they'll show the same song being proformed at different concerts.  Idea sound familiar?  It should if you've seen the Nine Inch Nails live DVD \\"And All That Could Have Been.\\"  The difference is that NIN did it right, smooth transistions and even people who don't like Nails can enjoy the concert experiance.  <br />This DVD however is choppy almost to the point of it being unwatchable.  I understand the reason for showing 55 angles every 2 minutes, but then give us a brief rest!   In that respect, the NIN DVD is superior. <br />Ignoring the angles/views (which can be done with our good friend alcohol), the proformance portions are absolutlely astounding.  What a stage presence, what a voice, and what a bassist.  From the \\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\\" to \\"Lunchbox,\\" the crowd is really into it and the music is great.  \\"The Death March,\\" the quasi-documentary on this disk, is absolutely hilarious.  <br />Overall good, not great.  I liked it better when it was called \\"And All That Could Have Been.\\"
B000003TA4|5.0|I know it's been 11 years since \\"Nevermind\\" was released, and since then everyone in the known universe has anointed it the greatest and most influential album of all time. And, yes, Kurt Cobain's masterpiece did bear a serious significance for the legions of hard rock bands out there today...but that is not why it is such a classic collection.  No imitation can do justice to the songcraft and musicianship on exhibition during these tunes--Cobain's scream, which even has traces of humor among its black madness, is one of the most penetrating sounds ever committed to tape, and his guitar playing is consistently startling (the understated, aesthetically perfect solo on \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is truly a grand accomplishment).  This is punk augmented with the pop sensibilities of The Beatles and dusted with a bit of \\"Plastic Ono Band\\"-era Lennon, and thus it outshines so many other hard rock records, standing as a beacon of genius.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is an amazing collection of songs. There is so much meaning to every lyric its amazing! The songs are awesome. And you can tell the growth. Christina has always had an amazing voice but you can really hear it on this album. AWESOME!
B00006LLNU|2.0|Twice I've sat all the way through this album and twice I've forgotten that I was listening to anything. I gave it three stars because there is maybe one good moment: I momentarily perked up during track 4. <br />How could they have so soon forgotten how to make a great album? Everything that makes Agaetis Byrjun so fantastic is nowhere to be found. Even when they try to make the music soar you don't go with it; you're just left sitting there wishing they would get it over with.
B00006CXXU|5.0|awesome awesome awesome! amazing! i love it! the best yet! christina has grown so much and you can really tell. there is so much emotion in the songs and everything. its just an amazing cd
B00006V9A0|1.0|What are Geffen record trying to sell. One song!! Most fans will have Never mind and In Utero and 9 songs are from these 2 albums. what is the point of this release ??? Guess they want to make money by selling bad stuff. First media turns Cobain as a hero.. and he gets lot of attention for shooting himself. how coward and stupid it is. Wake up people.. we have better bands than Nirvana like Pearl Jam, soundgarden and AIC. They have got to much credit for producing worthless records. It took me 10 years of denial that Nirvana sucks. I really don't care for this record personally. This CD should have been marketed as a 2 disc. other disc containing B-sides. This is a complete example of lazyness. first they have 4 songs from Never mind and then 5 songs continuous from InUtero. What kind of mixing is this? Stay away from this. Everyone has all the songs!!! I still love unplugged and Never mind..
B000065V1V|3.0|I promise I've given this album plenty of listens; finally this week I taped it and began listening in the car, where, as many of us know, the real scrutiny happens.  I've seen Mr. Jones appear on several talk shows and give spirited performances of songs that I know he truly believes in.  I've heard the previously reluctant critics rave about this one.  And I've rated his previous four efforts very highly, especially the collaboration with Eno a few years ago.  &quot;Heathen&quot; just doesn't pull me in.  I'm mildly hooked by about half of the material, but even most of that seems a bit hollow.  I don't have much qualm with the execution--his performance of &quot;Slip Away&quot; is impassioned and inspired--and it seems lots of attention was given to each song.  The songs themselves just fall a bit short of what I expect from Bowie.  Or, as in the case of &quot;Slip Away,&quot; he sabotages a potentially great song with a refrain like, &quot;Twinkle, twinkle Uncle Floyd.&quot;  And I know I should be tapping along with &quot;Everyone Says Hi,&quot; but the lyrics don't really paint anything vivid in my mind.  The covers of &quot;Cactus&quot; and &quot;I've Been Waiting for You&quot; may well be the highlights of the album for me.  The final track has finally begun to grow on me, but generally the Bowie material is weak.  I'm willing to cut him some slack since he's a devoted Dad now, but this one has me longing for &quot;Hours,&quot; a curiously maligned album with songs that seem to come off a lot less laboriously than these.
B00006V9A0|5.0|The \\"new\\" Nirvana song may not be as great as the classics in Nevermind, but as far as I know, ANY Nirvana song, even if tehy compile outtakes and soundchecks and package them to an album will be infinitely better than the fresh crop of \\"manufactured\\" rock bands that they've been churning out lately and is testing my faith on good rock music since the late '90s... acts like incubus, creed, puddle of mudd, p.o.d., staind, the calling... <br />With this album, and hopefully Pearl Jam's Riot Act will be excellent, perhaps all is not lost in rock.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Bad movie.  I was expecting a greater focus on the role of the Navaho code, instead it's about a shell-shocked Nic Cage coming to terms with his personal demons.  A bright spot: Adam Beach does some fine acting.  Looking for a good war flick, check out Black Hawk Down, We Were Soliders, Saving Private Ryan, and the soon to be released &quot;Band of Brothers.&quot;  These films are much more believable.
B000002UUH|5.0|In his small solo career Lennon seems to have produced more good music than his former bandmate McCartney.  What a shame this brave seeker of peace and harmony met such an early, violent end.  <br />I highly recommend this collection.  There are no throwaways, and many of the tracks are absolutely excellent.<br />1. Give Peace A Chance * * * * * - Lennon in full force.  Powerful and catchy and the same time.<br />2. Instant Karma! * * * * * - One of Lennons most comercially successful songs.  Excellent lyrics, as usual.<br />3. Power to the People * * * * - Strong message, as always.<br />4. Whatever Gets You Through the Night * * - not my style of music.<br />5. #9 Dream * * * * * - dreamy beautiful song.<br />6. Mind Games * * * * * - One of my favorite Lennon tracks.<br />7. Love * * * - pleasant.<br />8. Happy Xmas (War is Over) * * * - fun at Christmas time.<br />9. Imagine * * * * * - the essential Lennon track.  &quot;You may say I'm a dreamer...But I'm not the only one...I hope some day you'll join us...And the world will live as one&quot;<br />10. Jealous Guy * * * * good self-baring track.<br />11. Stand By Me * * * * * I love his cover of this song.  Raw, powerful, devastatingly well-sung.<br />12. (Just Like) Starting Over * * * * good, forgotten track.<br />13. Woman * * * * * Beautiful, sounds like the Beatles...<br />14. I'm Losing You * * *<br />15. Beautiful Boy (darling boy) * * * *<br />16. Watching the Wheels * * * * grows on you...great melody and lyrics<br />17. Dear Yoko * * * fun, straight-up rock love song<br />18. Move Over Ms. L * *<br />19. Cold Turkey * * *
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I love Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider! Angelina is strong, fun, and free. Wonderful movie!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|Tis albums great, i just got it yesterday and its fabulous. Its got 3 songs with only eminem, however he is in almost every other. The 3 songs with eminem are all probably his best work:<BR>Looseyourself<BR>8mile<BR>Run Rabbit Run<BR>Plus i think the best song is Adreline Rush, Obie trice is also in alot of ghis songs. Not alot of Dre. If you like dre still buy it though. And if you dont well STILL BUY IT! Its real good. 5tars man!
B00006CXXU|5.0|The album has such an AMAZING sound and style to it. The audacious new album from Christina Aguilera \\"Stripped\\" is now out in stores and i recommend you to BUY IT. It is definetley worth your money. The best songs from the album are \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Keep Singin My Song\\", \\"Cruz\\", and \\"Walk Away\\". The album is very different from her first single off the album \\"Dirrty\\". Go buy the album NOW and you wont be dissapointed at all. This is the BEST album of the year and i smeel GRAMMIES on the way. go christina!
B000069HKH|5.0|It's been too long since one of the all-time rock greats gave us new material worth spinning over and over, but Springsteen really delivers the goods here. The relation to 9/11 is painfully obvious in places, subtle in others, and it underscores the entire album with the melancholy that most great rock albums have. But the kicker is that despite the somber material, you can't help but sing along.
B000003TAR|1.0|I've heard some stale music in my time, but this one just might take the cake.  \\"In Utero\\" aptly demonstrates Nirvana's glaring lack of musical talent, but the real kicker here is that the lyrics are actually worse.  These songs are utterly void of any of the self-imposed cross examination that characterizes an educated adult.  Indeed, they remind one of a teen prank gone awry...an underachieving snob's ill-fated attemt to garner attention without merit.  <br />While pop music is almost always a tribute to the mundane, Nirvana in particular was adept at appealling to all of our culture's mass-packaging potential...they lobbed softballs at teennie boppers, college kids, and ... dolts alike.  That alone can explain the baffling success of such lumbering tracks as \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" and \\"Rape Me.\\"  Nirvana might be the musical equivalent of Fear Factor and Baywatch...a lightweight and cliched tour de force that, at best, kills some time for the average Joe.  The sad difference, however, is that they probably took themselves seriously.  <br />For musical prowess, lyrical creativity, and overall atmosphere, this album is a monumental bust.  Five stars, however, go to its unintended comedic value.
0446677450|3.0|By writing them. I have read three of the Author's financial self help books and really have not been impressed by any of them.  Yes, he talks a lot about the ways he has made money and even gives some decent examples of how other people might make money, but I doubt that he has found any sure fire method to become rich.  I would take his work much more seriously if he published his books with copies of his tax returns and investment returns as proof of his methods.  I would venture a guess that his largest source of income/wealth may be from his best-selling books.
B00006V9A0|5.0|A great mix of the songs that made Nirvana famous. My favorite band, and many other people's favorite band, Nirvana changed the music that was popular in the early 90's. One of the greatest bands ever in my opinion. Thanks for th great music, and <BR>RIP <BR>Kurt Cobain
0316666343|4.0|This book was a great read.  Sad at times but also endearing.  Written from a very different perspective.  I highly recommend it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|In the harsh world of Entertainment, especially starting young, it's hard to grow up and develop. Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Kriss Kross, along with droves of other child stars hoping to make a life-long career out of show business rarely make it very far as adults, Christina Aguilera knows this, her Pop driven debut may have helped start her out on the road, she had to leave that behind, and the sweet, innocent Christina is dead, and a young woman stands in her place.<BR>   The sexually driven video for \\"Dirrty\\", her \\"Interesting\\" cover on Rolling Stone, as well as her \\"creative\\" fashion sense have definitely pushed a certain image into most people's minds. <BR>But push away anything you may be questioning about Christina's moral status, her fashion sense, or where her 11 piercings dwell, and listen to stripped: <BR>The album seems to hold everything extraordinary hidden within her frail frame. The album begins with a montage of rumors, words, news clips, and whatnot about Christina, and she interrupts with the intro, and invites the listener to find out who she is, \\"no hype, no glass, no pretense, just me, stripped\\" <BR>The first cut\\" Can't Hold Us Down\\" is a female power groove with contagious beats, a catchy chorus, and fellow Lady Marmalade Lil Kim. \\"Walk Away\\" is bluesy soul ballad that throbs with believable pain about the end of a relationship, then on to the rock empowered \\"Fighter.\\" Latin flavor envelopes the undeniably catchy \\"Infatuation.\\" Fellow Diva Alicia Keys accompanies Ms Aguilera on \\"Impossible\\" and Christina seems to conjure up Etta James [it's very reminiscent of her live performances of \\"At Last\\"] \\"Beautiful\\" is perfectly titled, and she brings up a psychedelic rock chick vibe on \\"Make Over,\\" complete with rock wailing. but it's \\"I'm Okay\\" that brings something utterly amazing to the LP, a sad, believable and moving song about an abusive father \\"the look of pain on my mother's face as my father's fist put her in her place\\" brings some amazing newcredibility to the former teen genie, while \\"Voice Within\\" is the expected, yet amazing ballad has the Mariah Carey power feel- and much like Mariah's Butterfly was her emergence into musical perfection, and artistic freedom, \\"Stripped\\" is Christina's burst from the pop cocoon, and will undoubtedly take her to some amazing levels as a true artist, the Pop star is dead, and Christina Aguilera lives as true music artist
B00005T30L|5.0|When I first saw an advertisement for the Ghost World DVD I expected it to be another teen comedy like American Pie, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that Terry Zwigoff directed it since I really enjoyed the heck out of Crumb. Ghost World is about what you would expect after seeing Crumb, though Crumb was an actual documentary and this is fiction. There really isn't a typical plot, but the characters are really great. If you despise most contemporary culture--MTV, rap music, sports bars, frat boys, business majors, fake fifties diners, and so on--then you'll most likely embrace the misanthropic spirit of this film. It doesn't provide any simple answers, but it's still a cathartic experience watching the film's star, Enid, reject everything around her. If movies like American Pie make you angry, if TV shows like MTV's Real World make you want to vomit, if you feel alienated by every popular song played on the radio, and feel that maybe the Earth would be a better place if it were struck by an asteroid, then this DVD is a must-buy.
0385508417|5.0|I have now discovered what to give for Christmas this year!  My step-parents, cousins, acquaintances, and -laws both in- and out- are all getting a copy.  I loved it!<br /><br />Now, you know I don't like to give away the plot.  (As if the title itself doesn't do that!)  All I can say is, read it!  It's the perfect book for Christmas day, when you're watching all that expensive wrapping paper fill up three giant-size garbage bags and head for the landfills.<br /><br />Oh, and be sure to buy the hardcover.  I know, it's out in paperback.  But the hardcover is so much nicer, more durable ('cause you'll read it over and over), and it doesn't mention that horrific movie title.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina has grown up a lot since her \\"Genie in the Bottle\\" days.  On her new disc, she strips down and shows us what she is truly made of.  Her voice is awesome, and she even co-wrote most of the songs (a terrific move that makes her music more personal).  Her new CD reminisces that of Mariah's \\"Daydream\\" and \\"Butterfly\\" albums.  She deals with the controversy of the Eminem/Fred Durst rumours (\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"), respect, self-esteem (\\"Beautiful\\"), and domestic abuse (\\"I'm OK).  This is truly a feat that most pop artists don't pull off...well.  Christina, however, soars her way to the top with her new album.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Well, it seems like every week now there is a new \\"greatest hits\\" collection of some sort.  Don't get me wrong here, The stones, Elvis, Bowie, these are all great musicians, but this is a CD that is not a greatest hits collection, rather a greatest songs collection.  This is more like a musical revelation, as it just blows the water out of all other albums on the charts right now.  This is really just a great cd and includes choice tracks that can be listened to over and over again. \\"You know you're right\\" is a song that is also being just belted out over and over and over again countless times on Mtv and radio again, and I have to say, I enjoy it.<br />Seems like Nirvana is making a comeback to the general public, while they have never been gone to me.  <br />In short, wether or not you are a nirvana fan at heart, you will enjoy this album, and I regard it as one of the best of all time.
B00006LLNU|3.0|This album is weird. Sigur Ros have created the kind of antimatter of bloated concept records with this one. The album is essentially untitled, as are all the songs; the packaging contains no writing aside from the band name written neatly on the front; the &quot;lyrics&quot; are in a made up language known as &quot;Hopelandic,&quot; which basically means they're gibberish, which each individual listener is meant to interpret into whatever s/he wants. Ladies and gentlemen, this album is about nothing but the music itself.<br />So what is the music like? Well, Sigur Ros, along with Mogwai and Godspeed You Black Emperor! form the holy trinity of an emerging genre dubbed by some as &quot;post-rock.&quot; This translates to long songs (the shortest of the 8 tracks on this album is over 6 and a half minutes) that are slow and drawn out (I'm talking like 20bpm here). The sounds sometimes seem very intimate and breathy, and at others, create vast sonic landscapes that leave the listener feel dwarfed and helpless. The instrumentation blends very well together, and creates rich sonic paintings, and the vocals are quite pleasing and blend like just another instrument.  <br />There is also a bit of a duality to this album, as the ( ) label somewhat suggests. The first half of the record creates a much softer, more uplifting aural picuture. The second half, on the other hand, is much more melancholic and feels far more cold and alien. Though it's really hard to pick favourites off a record like this, tracks 3 and 7 stand out in my mind, for whatever reason.<br />Of course, an album like this is not for everyone, for sure. I suspect many casual music fans will be bored stiff or just plain weirded out by this; it would be very soporific to anyone looking for a catchy tune or even a traditional song structure. It's also not a record that one can just throw on at any old time; this album is a mood piece for sure.<br />However, if you're feeling adventurous, grab a copy, turn off the lights, get some headphones and drift off to the strange, fantastical world of the Sigur Ros.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the best soundtrack I have heard since Gladiator.  Shore does a fantastic job setting the mood for each scene and bringing out the power of each event in this masterpiece.
B00005JK8K|5.0|I loved this movie for what it was. Some of the reviews I read seemed to expect too much from this movie. Sure it was a war movie. Sure it wasn't totally historically accurate. Sure it had some cliches. But let's be honest; not every war movie is historically accurate. A lot of war movies focus more on drama and the soldiers' lives. This one didn't. This was an action epic, and I liked that. While movies like Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart focused on acting, this one focused on action. Both are good. John Woo did a good job, and Nicolas Cage's acting was fine. In fact it was really good, since it convinced some reviewers that Nicolas Cage was actually that dull of a person. But he had to act that way to portray the character, which made the movie even better.<br />So, all in all this movie wasn't the best war movie ever made, but it served it's purpose as an entertaining action movie for fans of the genre.
020530902X|4.0|This tiny volume offer more advice on how to become a better writer in less space than any other. While it is not a &quot;fun&quot; read, it is absolutely mandatory for anyone who wishes to communicate through written words. Will Strunk is concise, direct, and unflinching in his examination of many bad habits which writers may knowingly possess.<br />There is an extensive (by this book's standards, at least) section about words that are frequently used incorrectly, as well as rules regarding composition, form, and style. He instructs us with examples of correct and incorrect word, punctuation, and grammar use, and briefly explains each example. One possible complaint is that perhaps at times, he is too brief; this is not a book for someone who doesn't understand the basic parts of speech. If you loathe the idea of relearning those little buggers, may I suggest _The Deluxe Transitive Vampire_, which is a bit more engaging than the standard basic grammar book.<br /><br />Whenever a writer is unsure of what is the correct way to express him- or herself, that person should reach for this book. Heck, reading it over in spare moments to refresh one's memory of the rules. _Elements of Style_ will make a better writer of anyone who pays attention to it. Keep it by your writing space, keep it in mind.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This cd is amazing! I can't stop listening to it. John Mayer has tallent and &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is obvious proof. I love every song on this cd. It cheers me up and it's just fun to sing along with. Get this cd.....you WONT be dissapointed.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I absolutely adore the Harry Potter books...this movie had a lot going for it -- a brilliant cast (Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrain, John Cleese), the greatest composer of our time (John Williams) and a script given the thumbs-up by J.K. Rowling herself. Columbus, thankfully, proved me wrong. He delivered a great film that was faithful to the book and found three enormously talented young actors to guide this project.<br />I only wish Warner Bros. had put as much effort into this DVD set as the filmmakers obviously did into their movie.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's an okay DVD, and certainly worth getting if you're a fan of the film, but as far as extras go, there's not much to recommend it for the grown-up audience. There are some nice deleted scenes and a few games that the kids will enjoy, but that's about it...I still recommend the DVD, because the movie is absolutely fantastic, but don't expect much else to hold your attention if you're over the age of 11.
006109594X|1.0|I knew this was a stinker when a group of US Navy guys are talking about the Boston Redsox &quot;First Batsman&quot; (leadoff hitter).  Gimme a break.  Did this author have an editor?  If you can believe the US would go after Iran - which did nothing, and do nothing to Iraq - which nuked a carrier.. then this is right up your alley.
B00006V9A0|5.0|...or should I say &quot;had&quot; to offer. This album is a great tribute to Nirvana and a long awaited greatest hits offering. The new tune is absolutely great and definitely deserves to be on a CD with the rest of Nirvana's best songs. A great CD, definitely worth the purchase. I can't say enough about it.
0060245867|5.0|On the surface this book appears to be a cute tale of cause and effect that results from giving a mouse a cookie. Although this appeals to children, it is merely a metaphor for the real point of the book. Though the boy gives and gives of himself, the mouse is never satisfied, and continues to demand more and more of the boy. Clearly this illustrates the writer's view of the inherent problems in a capitalist economy.<BR><BR>Through this allegory, the book tells of the plight of the common man. Here we see the working class (as represented by the boy) stooping and fetching for the much smaller privileged upper class (the mouse). Though the mouse appears to be helpful by cleaning the whole house, this simply illustrates the charade of the class system. The tools the rich use to clean are provided by the exploitation of the poor workers. The upper class demands that the workers attend their needs for little or no pay while the rich \\"clean up.\\" Throughout it all, the working class maintains its servile attitude, hoping to reap some reward for its efforts, but the end of the book demonstrates that this is an illusion; the cycle inevitably repeats itself.<BR><BR>Children enjoy this book because the cause and effect relationship of the events is easily memorized and predictable. Just like the never-ending class struggle, as the author astutely points out.
0590259385|5.0|The book is your Mama a Llama is a good book for extremely young children because the book helps children see what different kinds of animals are in the world.  The book also explains where the animals live and some common things the do.  In the book there is a young llama that goes up to different animals and asked them if there mamas a llama, and the book even rhymes.  I would recommend this book for parents to read to their children to teach the different animals or for beginning readers.  Those who read this book should really enjoy it.
6305810109|5.0|There are very few films that I gush over, and this is by far close to the top of my list. I'm not into tons of verbage describing the film's plot, neither am I in the habit of offering any verbose or superfluous words in writing a review on it. Having said that, this film is a gem. I watched this alone, by accident, while channel surfing one evening. At film's end, I ended up bawling like a baby. That hardly, if ever happens. This story is so unique, with so much care taken into making it that you would have to be blind not to recognize the true genius of it all. It has just about every emotion that we have inside us wrapped like a gift sitting under a Christmas tree waiting to be opened. This film will stay with me forever. The best advice I can give is just to see the damn thing! If it doesn't move you, then I am truly sorry.
B000002A33|5.0|Back in the &quot;grunge&quot; days I was somewhat of a screaming trees fan. I bought DUST in '96 when it came out and loved it. Then my car got broken into and the CD vanished. 4 Years later, I remembered DUST and snagged myself another copy. Upon playing it for the first time in years I was ablsolutely taken all over again. This album is such a mastierpiece of music it's almost unreal. It's like a dream. It makes me want to start a rock n' roll band. Halo of Ashes is the perfect starter. All I know feels like an old friend to me. Sworn and Broken is likely my favorite song and every time I hear that incredible harpsicord solo it sends shivers up my spine. The Screaming Trees were a band torn apart by constant inter-band turmoil. The making of this album was perhaps the pinacle of that turmoil. However, dispite all the problems the band had and whether they knew it or not, they produced what I consider one of the best rock albums ever made. YOU MUST OWN THIS ALBUM!
B00005AFMT|5.0|Back in my punk rock days we used to go around bashing all the prog rock dinosaur bands. It was 1980 and I was still into Bowie 'cause he was a freak, so I went out and bought the new 'Scary Monsters' record. <br />    As I listened to that album, I immediately wanted to know who in the hell the WILD guitar playing was by. It obviously wasn't Mick Ronson. Earl Slick? No. Carlos Alomar? Nope. I turned the album over: Robert Fripp......huh? Never heard of him.<BR>He must be new. The guy obviously had a LOT of musical training, but here he was doing these strange licks all over the record that managed to be beautiful & frightening at the same time...and MY GOD he was fast! The licks on Because You're Young outblazed the (then) new Eddie Van Halen & this guy WAS PICKING, not 'tapping'! I was astounded. I had to know where this superguitarist came from.<br />    Fortunately, at the time I was also into the Talking Heads & Zappa, so I was following the career of another new avant-garde guitar player named Adrian Belew. In an interview he mentioned that he had joined the newly \\"reformed\\" King Crimson. I had heard of them, but wrote them off as old prog rock bastards like ELP & Yes with their 100 year long flights of boredom. However, Adrian mentioned that his fellow guitarist was Robert Fripp.<br />    CooL! That was the dude I'd been looking for! This was going to be a hellacious band.<br />    I had no idea at the time how right I was, and how utterly ignorant of the Crimson version of prog rock I had been.<br />    Quick trip to the record store: Hey! New King Crimson album!<BR>Called Discipline. Yep, Fripp & Belew are on here. I GOTTA have this album! Hmmm...bass player is Tony Levin. I've heard of him. Oh yeah, he's on that new guy's album I just bought...Peter Gabriel. And Bruford. Isn't he that drummer from that old fart band, Yes? Well I want something different,...<br />     At home on the turntable the most frightenly good musicians I'd heard since Jimi Hendrix came storming out of the speakers Like a rolling thunderclap in a summer storm that had snuck up on me, I stood back  awed by the intensity of what I was hearing.<br />    Elephant Talk. I knew it was Adrian singing, but he sounded out of his mind: \\"Advice! Answers! ArTIC-yew-lut AhNOUNCE-ments!<BR>...it's only talk!\\" God, this is wild. And there was that sinuous guitar fluttering in and out..I immediately knew it was Fripp.<br />    Two more songs went by. Beautiful. \\"Matte Kudasai\\" & \\"Frame By Frame\\". They were haunting.<br />   Then: \\"I DO remember one thing....it took hours & hours...\\" This next song was scary: \\"Indiscipline\\". Adrian sounded even more out of his head than before, like some mad genius trying to comprehend the frustrating act of intellect that had been forced on him. (Later found out it was based on a letter from his wife. How different than I imagined). And the entire time the band weaved in & out doing MONSTER riffing, sounding like they were going to explode, but still keeping it tightly together. And the drumming...I'd obviously been WRONG about Bruford. This guy was incredible!<br />    And so my introduction to King Crimson went.<br />    This album still has the same effect on me to this day. Whenever I'm playing in a band and some young punk kid starts talking about boring old dinosaur bands, I laugh & think of me. THEN I lay this album on them. It never fails that they come back obviously changed by what they've heard.<br />    I still love old school punk. I still hate a lot of the pretentiousness of '70's bands....<br />     .... But I FREAKIN' LOOOVVVE KING CRIMSON!<BR>  <BR>   No wonder Tool had them as an opening act. Should've been the other way 'round.<br />   Want your mind changed about prog? <br />   Get Discipline.
B000068PQ0|3.0|The first song is close to a note for note rip-off of Cat Stevens'  \\"Father and Son.\\"  Is this irony?  Or just sad?  <br />The rest of the CD is OK in a newer-radiohead sort of way, but unfortunately no where near as catchy as the melody<BR>they \\"borrowed.\\"
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is a sexy artist with a sexy body, sexy voice, sexy face, sexy outfits, and sexy personality. I love her new style and new music . The \\"Dirty\\" video that is on MTV is a masterpiece just like her.... Great CD overall
B000065VB9|5.0|I love this album and probably always will. <BR>I haven't read all of the MILLIONS of previous reviews, so I apologize in advance if this has already been mentioned...<BR>There are no cymbals on this album. No crashes or splashes, no rides, no hi-hats. No chinas! It was a brilliant and very effective idea that subtly helped create the dark and powerful feel of this album. A true work of art.
1573225517|4.0|High Fidelity, Nick Hornby, Penguin Books, London, 245pp., £6.99  <br /> The plot of this entertaining novel is simple and even slightly adolescent. Rob Fleming is a troubled, profoundly narcissistic man in his mid-thirties, who owns a failing record shop called `Championship Vinyl' in one of London's seedier areas. On his payroll are two misfits named Barry and Dick who are almost totally unsuited to any other kind of employment, and who, together with Rob, display a vast amount of knowledge about pop-trivia in all its forms. Indeed, Rob is so expert at his job that he can find for a customer a record he has only dreamed of (literally) in his sleep. Barry can bully diffident customers into purchases, and Dick takes a gentler, more intuitive approach, to similar effect.<BR> At the start of the novel, Rob is the only one of the three who seems to have a `normal' life, as he at least has had numerous girlfriends. Currently, however, his love-life is going through leaner times, as his live-in partner Laura has just announced she is leaving him. More significant events are few and far between in this novel, but as it progresses, Rob encounters Marie LaSalle, a talented American singer in a local pub; he learns that Laura has moved in with a ghastly male neighbour whom he disliked previously and now positively loathes, he rearranges his record collection (for Rob a major event), and so on. His most memorable sexual `conquest' is Marie, although her frankness about sexual needs and occasional crudities grate a little against Rob's English sense of decorum. <BR> Rob continues to exhibit jealousy over Laura, however, and becomes childishly obsessed with finding out whether she has slept with her new boyfriend, Ian Raymond (aka `Ray'). He then embarks on a voyage of discovery by re-contacting five previous girlfriends, (Alison, Penny, Jackie, Sarah and Charlie), in an attempt to discover what it was about his personality that led to their final rejection of him. This questproves full of discoveries for Rob. Alison has married the boyfriend who supplanted him, Penny informs him that he rejected her, Jackie is a dull woman with an equally dull spouse; Sarah seems destined to be a wallflower, and this leaves only the best of them, Charlie, whom Rob still idealises. She proves to be the most disappointing and enlightening of all. At a dinner party, he finally sees Charlie for what she is (and always was). Despite her beauty, she emerges as a conversationally inane, shallow, desperately hopeless bore. Things that previously enthralled Rob about her all turn out to have been utterly misconceived.  <BR> In the meantime, Barry has joined a rock group as lead vocalist, about which Rob is brutally cynical, and Dick has picked up a new girlfriend. The most life-changing event, however, occurs when Laura's father, Ken, passes away, and Rob is invited to the funeral. As he sees Laura's grief unfolding before his very eyes, he suddenly rejects his need to change; he realises he has changed already, and for the better. The remainder of the novel is somewhat predictable, but is not without charm. He and Laura get back together, and she sets about disabusing him of many of his preconceptions and bringing out all his own hidden talents. He resumes his career as a DJ, which in years gone by had brought him true happiness, and is reluctantly coerced into introducing Barry's band, Sonic Death Monkey, at a concert. Much to Rob's amazement, Barry launches into a note-perfect rendition of several popular songs, and the last scales finally fall from Rob's eyes. A marriage proposal to Laura is the ultimate consequence, and although she does not say `yes' immediately, or at any point in the novel, we know that settling down together is a strong possibility for she and Rob. The ending is ambiguous, but full of hope for a better future.<BR> Perhaps the novel's greatest strength is its humour, and the vividness with which it recreates the most difficult periods of life, such as adolescent sexual awakening. In the best traditions of the `confessional' novel, Rob does not hesitate to reveal his darker side. Yet he also challenges his readers to look at themselves, and to realise that despicable acts are not solely confined to him.  The novel's first person narration is particularly well-suited to this type of study. The style comes across as a valid attempt to present realistic reflection and conversation without over-indulgence in obscenities for their own sake and ever-diminishing shock value. This is also a very British novel in terms of its allusions, moods and settings (its location was successfully altered to Chicago in Frears' film version).<BR> Hornby reveals clearly his understanding of the novelist's craft. The characters are archetypes: the drifter on a perennial attempt to eschew commitment and responsibility (Rob), the smart `yuppie' (Laura), the folksinger (Marie), the stud (T-Bone), the `little boy lost' (Dick), the outrageous extrovert (Barry), the politically correct but nauseating modern man (Ian / Ray), the troublesome tramp (Johnny), the beautiful but socially inadept glamour-puss (Charlie), the feminist (Liz), and the pitiful geek whom Rob labels `The Most Pathetic Man in the World'. Recognisable plot devices work smoothly: Hornby understands the value of dramatic first appearances and  unconscious revelations. He presents us with representative sections of conversation, which illustrate his main themes: loneliness and frustration. <BR> Barry's vocal talent represents a `sleeping' detail which Hornby holds deep in reserve, until the very last pages of the novel. The author also delights in creating false expectations about this, through Rob's cynicism and refusal to believe that Barry's musical abilities are anything other than truly terrible. And the novel concludes with a series of vignettes, presenting characters we have met in typical poses, a technique worthy enough for Shakespeare's `Cymbeline' even. So re-live your youth and middle-years with Rob Fleming and Nick Hornby's `High Fidelity'. You won't regret it.<br />Dr. Kenneth D. Farrow<BR><kfarrow@supanet.com>
B00006CXXU|5.0|That is really all I have to say for this CD.....WOW. Finally a \\"pop\\" singer has come out with a cd with a lot to offer. Even though I do not really like her new image of a \\"sex kitten,\\" it is not her body that I like.  Her voice is what I AM interested in, and she is definetly the greatest singer of all time. And the best thing about this cd that is different than what her past songs have offered, is that she does do all of those vocal accrobatics every two seconds.  She has proven to the world that she CAN sing, and now the cd is all about that voice. I know that a lot of people will judge this cd from \\"Dirrty,\\" which really is the worst song on the cd.....but please don't. My fav. song is \\"I'm Ok,\\" where she starts to cry while she sings about her past.  It is so sad. The cd has a whole is amazing.  You will not be dissapointed....promise.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd is really amazing. There's not one song that i dont like on this album. She has really done a great job. She has a great voice and although she's really raunchy now i still like her. keep up the good work chris!!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|To celebrate the 20th anniversary of E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial's release (has it been 20 years???), Steven Spielberg made some cosmetic changes to the film (a la George Lucas with the Star Wars Trilogy), and returned it to theatres; now, in a beautiful package, BOTH versions of the film, plus an array of terrific special features, are available to buy for under $25, and it's a GREAT investment!<br />While only a few minor scenes were reinserted, the new version offers an E.T. with more expression and movement (thanks to C.G.I.), more colorful and magical night skies and alien spacecraft, and, as was widely publicized, the agents' guns have been all digitally changed to walkie-talkies (as Spielberg felt the weapons were too threatening). The best part of the package are the extras, including a 'Making-of' documentary, outtakes from the original film (did you know Harrison Ford originally had a cameo?), a concert version of the theme, performed by John Williams and orchestra, interviews with the artists who created the creature, and, best of all, a reunion of the original leads (they all look WONDERFUL!), with Spielberg. (No, B-movie star C. Thomas Howell, and Playmate/Actress Erika Eleniak, both of whom were in the original, are included in the reunion!)<br />The only disappointment in the Special Edition is that they DON'T address what has become the great unanswered controversy of E.T. ...who actually provided the voice of the creature? Debra Winger is the person most frequently mentioned, but the question is never even asked. I guess SOME mystery has to be maintained!<br />Definitely a keeper!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Because I can't stop listening.  This has become my favorite CD.  The singing is good (for presumably non-musical people), the tunes are catchy, and the lyrics are beautiful and meaningful, particularly Buffy's songs and duets with Spike.  Taking insipiration from and obviously poking a bit of fun at Broadway musicals, this CD just makes you want to sing along.  The *extra* track of Joss and his wife's demo recording is great!  If you love the show, you need this CD.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros have gone above themselves, above the glacial overproduced kitsch that was their second album, if you count Von.  While I was a fan of AB, it didn't have that much staying power, I didn't find it overwhelmingly beautiful or tear-inducing as some had claimed.  It was different, and for that reason, kind of a little mind-blowing on first listen.  But once the shock was gone, there wasn't that much there except for a few string arrangements, and bowed guitar explosions.  The voice of the famous Jonsi on this album is toned down, not going for the uber high notes of years past.  And its all the more effective for that reason.  I've never had an album completely kick my ... like this one.  It literally depressed the hell out of me, it's ridiculous.  The track 3-4 punch is enough to bring me down to earth any day of the week.  7 and 8 are another great pair, totaling about 25 minutes of despair.  Its infinitely better than AB, because it stays with you.  It like follows me around, hahaha, I don't know what I'm talking about.  But listen to it.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a beautiful story, has amazing animation, with music that is to die for! And even the dub is pleasent. <br />I highly recommend this DVD to anyone, anime fan or no.
0380733358|5.0|Eye of the Needle, October 31, 2002<BR>Reviewer: Bob from Yokota AFB<BR>Well, first of all I'm going to point out that this was a great book.  Eye of the Needle had all the components, which makes any good book.  The book had tons of action, and suspense.  Follett's book always kept me guessing unexpected events occurred throughout the book.  Anyone who says that they guessed what happened throughout the book is telling a lie.  I highly recommend that everyone who likes good novels to read this book.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This is Sepultura's follow up album from &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;,this is my fav album,it provides wicked crunchy thrash metal riffs,to pounding double bass drums,and hatefull vocals from the MAN Max Cavalera,This is my fav cd in my whole cd collection,Sepultura never gets old,And i agree,if i could give this album more than five stars,i would.
0380977788|5.0|I have been reading this book to my son's fourth grade class and each time they beg me not to stop. They gasp as they listen to descriptions of \\"the other mother\\" and her evil ways, and quite frankly so do I. In fact, I couldn't stand waiting and had to read ahead between class sessions! Although aimed at children, this book does not talk down or pretend its audience can't handle its shocking and often original conceits. A mysterious door to nowhere, missing parents, singing rats, a doppelganger house that is a little fuzzy around the edges--it all rings terrifyingly true. The illustrations are also nicely sinister. You'll never look at black buttons the same way again.
0345350472|5.0|What is the difference between the `artificial' and the `real'? And, more importantly, is it possible to distinguish between the two? If so, how? By pure instinct, or with the help of objective rules? These questions receive multiple interpretations depending on when they intervene in Philip K. Dick's remarkable novel. The opening chapter presents their first occurence: Rick Deckard dreams of owning a real animal instead of the electric sheep he takes care of as if it was a real one (his neighbour was convinced that it was real). Such a distinction is central to Deckard's job: as a blade runner, he kills androids and is thus forced to distinguish between the real and the artificial; if he can't do so, his role loses all its meaning and he becomes a mere criminal. Both his instincts and the test he uses to make that distinction do not seem fool-proof, though, as he repeatedly discovers throughout the book. The humans - those who think they are humans - are not the only ones with questions about identity: three of the Nexus-6 androids Deckard is ordered to kill, Priss Stratton, Roy and Irmgard Baty, hide in a building with a `special' human, John Isidore (himself working for a company that `takes care' of electric animals and thus exposed to the same possible misjudgements), and wonder if he is indeed human and how much they should trust him. The same goes for two seemingly `metaphysical' characters, Buster (whose TV show is broadcasted twenty-four hours a day) and Mercer (empathy boxes enable mystical fusions with him). This is a complex and stimulating work, written by a brilliant thinker.
B00004WLXZ|5.0|A &quot;MUST&quot; for those who want to study the modern history of the spectacle and how it gained primacy over the real.  An interesting study would be to compare this film with the speech that Bush gave to Congress following 9/11.  There is an uncanny resemblance.
0385484518|5.0|the book \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was absolutely the best book i have ever read. it makes you think about life and death. it makes you look at yourself and ask yourself if your happy with you. there are so many things in life that we have to be thankful for but we take advantage of them.  morrie is an old man that is dying. he learns to accept the fact that he is going to die and makes the best out of the time he has. morrie spends his last months teaching an old student, mitch, how to live. he explains that its not the material things that matter but more the people in you life. the simpelest things have the biggest impact. this book is full of wonderful life lesons from how to love, live, and die, to how to forgive.

B00006CXXU|4.0|This was the kind of CD that I had hoped for. Not a dance heavy soon to be forgotten relic. But true vocals that will speak to the soul. &quot;Chris&quot; is in fine form, with the chops that all the girl band wanna be's only dream of. And her guest's only add to the mix, like good friends chillin out over a bottle of wine. Alicia is so smooth, and Lil' Kim is tolerable on the opening cut. I just wish that another Diva by the the name of P!nk would have made an appearence  :( All in All a great CD with a mix of soul, rock, and dance.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|well basically you lose yourself in your own world as you listen to the album word for word very good. not to explicit so it will be ok to buy for your youngsters!!! just brilliant.
B00006LLNU|5.0|when i bought this CD i feared, like many artists with a beautiful premiere album, that Sigur R&oacute;s would not be able to follow up to the talent or the anticipation resulting from the success of their first album. i am glad they proved me wrong. this album is one of the most beautiful things i have ever been graced to be able to listen to. from the first track's slow piano progression escalating ever so slowly to make your heart crave what is coming next, to the much anticipated studio version of \\"Nj&oacute;snav&eacute;lin\\" (track 04, previously heard in the rooftop scene in \\"Vanilla Sky\\"), this track especially, damn near made me weep, and almost now as i listen to \\"Nj&oacute;snav&eacute;lin\\" as i write this.  the album has been attacked as \\"not going anywhere\\" or of being a bit \\"monotonous,\\" and i disagree highly with these petty suspicions.  the beauty and complexity of taking a single synth wave and transforming, transmitting, manipulating, filtering, and layering it to achieve the highest emotional response from the listener is anything but lazy or boring.  even if the organisation of the song appears simple on its surface, sometimes the saying holds true that \\"simplicity is key,\\" and the true art is just knowing how to utilise it.  from the first track pushing a basic slow piano riff through your ears, to the throbbing bass lines in the track three, simplicity truly is key in this album.  the sounds, synths, keys and drums all ebb and flow like an ocean tide, pure and effortless and yet beautiful all at the same time.  sometimes complexity and intelligence are achieved by mere simplicity; but really, how easy is it to make songs that can grab and tug at your soul with their melancholy and somber keys repeating, repeating, repeating, and repeating, taking you further and further into a dark, quiet, and peaceful mental state?  sure, the CD may not go anywhere in aspects of having a traditional Verse Chorus Verse layout, but that is the point.  this disc makes the listener feel as if they are hovering, enwrapped in audio, as things become a bit louder, a bit harder, a bit harsher, a bit more emotional, everything becoming a bit more intense, and refusing to let you retreat.  the songs use elements of sound that tremble, vibrate, roar, and ripple through your conscious, and unconscious, mind.  you feel you have lost touch with the outside world as you listen to this CD tear through you, when in fact you have gone nowhere.  however, thanks to the beautiful ambient noises, slow piano keys, hurting vocals, and brush drum kits, and the overall \\"simplicity\\" exhibited in this disc by Sigur R&oacute;s, you feel you have left the world around you, drowned in your own thoughts.<br />if you have ever appreciated beauty in any form, you will love this CD.<br />you will love this CD.y are hovering, enwrapped in audio, as things become a bit louder, a bit harder, a bit harsher, a bit more emotional, everything becoming a bit more intense, and refusing to let you retreat.  the songs use elements of sound that tremble, vibrate, roar, and ripple through your conscious, and unconscious, mind.  you feel you have lost touch with the outside world as you listen to this CD tear through you, when in fact you have gone nowhere.  however, thanks to the beautiful ambient noises, slow piano keys, hurting vocals, and brush drum kits, and the overall \\"simplicity\\" exhibited in this disc by Sigur Rós, you feel you have left the world around you, drowned in your own thoughts.<br />if you have ever appreciated beauty in any form, you will love this CD.<br />you will love this CD.
B00005JKED|3.0|This is Denzel Washington's film.  It is not his finest role, nor his most complex, but it is among his most fascinating.  Washington plays aganist type as Detective Alonzo Harris, a roaving detective who leads his own squad of hard case/corrupt officers in a quest to clean up the streets a bit, and profit from it alot.<br />The story takes place in one day in LA, as Washington ostensibly trains officer Jake Hoyt, played by Ethan Hawke, for duty on his squad.  Hoyt wants the job, admires Harris, and wants to make a name for himself.  As Harris takes him through the day, we see Hoyt tested again and again, and pushed to the breaking point by a commander who assures him that everything is just a test.<br />Overall, the movie is very watchable.  The cinematography and direction are excellent, and one gets a feel for the hard side of Los Angeles.  There are inspired supporting turns, from Snoop Dog, Dr. Dre, and Scott Glen.  Sadly, the writing is not quite up to snuff, and it falls upon th relationship between Hawke and Washington to carry the film.  Hawke is meerly a decent actor in a cliched \\"good cop\\" role.  He is defined by the morality he apparently gre up with.  His Oscar nomination was an insult to Gene Hackman's brilliant turn in \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\".  Washington, however, deserves all the praise he ahs recieved.  He is at the same time vicious, sympathetic, and professional, and his good-natured badness drives the film, and keeps it from falling apart.  I don't think Denzel deserved the oscar.  Russell Crowe gave a much better performance in the otherwise dull \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", but his recieving it is no crime.  He makes the movie work as well as he can.<br />The movie loses it's way in the final act, with an ending telegraphed from early on, and the resolution to one storyline is such a Dues ex Machina that it pulled me out of the film for a bit.  This is more of a renter than anything else, but it is worth seeing once, if just for Washington's performance..
0783225970|5.0|First of all, this movie is a true classic, there's no doubt about it. It's arguably Brian De Palma's greatest movie and Al Pacino's biggest performance to date.<br />What I can't understand is the reason why this movie has been out of print on DVD for so long. It's even more irritating when you see all these recent releases of far inferior movies all coming out with the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" tag. Speaking of myself, I bought my copy of \\"Scarface\\" via the internet, unaware that I would have received a bootleg copy instead of the original package. Needless to say, the picture and sound quality are crap and there are absolutely no extra features on the disc. If Universal Studios decided to make this title available a while ago, this incident would never have happened. I mean, don't these guys realise that they're losing tons of money and favouring piracy due to the limited availability of the movie? You don't have to obtain an honours degree in management to realise that there's no way in hell you could lose money on a re-release of \\"Scarface\\".<br />So my final remark to Universal Studios is: please release a special collector's edition of \\"Scarface\\" for the upcoming 20th anniversary edition in 2003. I normally don't like to buy different releases of the same movie, but for \\"Scarface\\" I'll make an exception. You will make gangster movie buffs like myself one happy family.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|In my opinion Ryan Adams is one of the 10 most talented songwriters in the recording industry today.  It's saying something when Elton John told Ryan that Heartbreaker was one of his favorite albums, and Adam Duritz considers Ryan a better songwriter than himself (a close contest, but my vote goes to Adam for now).<br />Gold is an amazingly well written and smartly arranged album.  Almost as if the record is really a book put to music.  The beautiful thing about Ryan's songwriting is.... it doesn't exclude anyone.  His language is simple but clever and leaves much to the imagination.<br />I also admire his approach to American rock music.  You can tell he has a very good knowledge of music in general and he doesn't hesitate to embrace the best qualities of his favorite artists.<br />I've listened to Gold, Heartbreaker, Demolition, and some Whiskeytown for a year now, and I have to say Gold is the best!
B00005JK8K|2.0|I Thought I was going to watch a movie with some historical accuracy with some dramatic flare added for content.  Instead I watched an over acted over dramatized movie with little or no entertainment value.  Nicolas Cage Was the star in this film and had one of the worst performances I've ever seen.  If it had been billed a an action movie maybe it would have been better but since we were told it had some historical accuracy I was quite disappointed with the rambo style acting he added to this movie.  I will admit that the script he was working with did not give him much room for improvment.
B00005U1YO|4.0|This is a great electronic music CD, another masterpiece of the Chems, the CD hasn't a lot of hits like &quot;Surrender&quot; or it isn't as furious as &quot;Dig your own hole&quot;, but if you hear it as a whole package it isn't flawless. All the tracks are great and they assemble perfectly.<br />Ascroft's appereance is magnific and rises the level of &quot;The test&quot; another step above the rest of elctropop musicians. &quot;Galaxy bounce&quot; is the best track of all.<br />Note: If you can see a Chem's live concert, go there, I saw them in Benicassim 2002 and is the most spectacular and stunning concert I've ever been.

B000024D4R|5.0|Dark, misty, barren, seclusive and dilapidated. Am I talking about the music found on Pink Floyd's _Animals_? Actually, I was referring to the album artwork--inside and out. The music and lyrics found on here are not much different. Three of the tracks stand ten minutes or longer (Dogs: 17 minutes, Pigs: 11 minutes and Sheep: 10 minutes). Roger Waters labels humans as either 'dogs' (think of dogmatism), 'pigs' (think of greed and stubborness/pigheadedness) or 'sheep' (the meek and easily led). It's somewhat political in nature. Of course, I'm not presumably saying this is the accurate summary of the theme. This is just another way of looking at these things. Besides, this has been discussed more thoroughly in other reviews. Roger Waters' lyrical contributions are arguably his most caustic and aggressive, yet still manage to be thought-provoking and utterly equivocal (speaking in equivocations are a very popular, if not stereotypical trademark in rock today).<br />We'll start with \\"Pigs On The Wing\\" (Parts 1 and 2) first. Both are simplistic acoustic numbers which could be seen as dry runs of \\"Mother\\" from the following album, _The Wall_ (G, C, D, and F chords, plus an A minor added for good measure). The rest of the album lacks sanguinity (a growing Floyd trademark), but is given to dark, hypnotic and atmospherical spatiality, as well as harder-edged guitars. \\"Dogs\\" is a prime example of this. David Gilmour's guitar playing is top notch here. (Note: Some of the musical themes bring resemblance to the music theme for Valerie's Family/The Hogan Family, a fairly known television sitcom). The \\"synth-washed\\" middle section (featuring a dog barking in the background) is hypnotic, spellbinding, forbidding and powerful. \\"Pigs\\" is a funk/r&b-tinged edgy rocker. Roger Waters' sneering and sarcastic vocals bring this track to life (as well as a sinister laugh to some). \\"Sheep\\" has an arena/stadium rock feel that arguably gave hints to some of the trademark soundscapes found on _The Wall_. The middle section features some sinister keyboard work similar to that of Keith Emerson (ELP). The ending is truly explosive, intense and moving all at once.<br />_Animals_ is a bleak, dark, cynical, acerbic, atmospheric and moving masterpiece.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Beautiful and Impossible ... the only two songs and only description of all album. It's a real good melody and kind of Alicia keys' style. i live them.<br />the single &quot; Dirrty &quot; is very hot. and other songs such as Can't hold us down that featuring Lil Kim makes me wanna dance.<br />i love them all. i love them all.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Lyrically... There is one word that describes this cd; AMAZING. Christina has truely put it all on the line and has faded away from her \\"POP PRINCESS\\" persona. The album is raw, true, and rough. She makes some very clear points in a few songs (Beautiful, I'm Okay, Can't Hold Us Down, etc.) One word that really defines the album would have to be powerful. She holds nothing back, which makes you want to hear what she has to say next. <br />Vocally... She is a great singer, but does she have to scream? It's very annoying to the hear constant screaming. She has a beautiful voice, when she uses it right. A CD that displays her TRUE talent would be her Christmas CD (My Kind Of Christmas). Or rather, they all do. She just shouldn't scream. Believe it or not, when a singer screams the way she does, it's damaging to her voice. There is a technique to doing it right, making it sound good, and not having it chip your voice. (Not literally chip, I just used it for lack of a better word) <br />All in all, yes the CD is very worth the money and a listen. The girl has talent, she displays it, and the lyrics are very powerful (in the majority of the songs). Don't expect anything similar to her previous albums, it's not on this one.
B00006RINF|4.0|Just discovered these guys the other day at Rasputin's. If you're looking for a big, heavy, guitar/synth oriented band, female &amp; male vocals, give this Italian band a try. Definately an interesting Progressive Metal offering.<br />I was first attracted to the strength Christina's vocals on 'Unspoken'. At first I thought Madonna had come back to life, but it was really much too interesting to be her anymore. I just sat in the store, bought a copy, and have been listening for the last few days.<br />The band's music is nice and good, if sometimes a little cliched, but nothing to be put off by. 'Entwined' uses many standard guitar tricks, all to the songs betterment. The title tune 'Comalies' is sung mostly in Italian which I dug.<br />Cheers!
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I first heard the album I was shocked at how mature and wonderful the whole album is! I found myself saying out loud, \\"Is this Christina Aguilera?\\" The girl has definetly grown up since her last album. She talks about everything that I can realate to--family problems, love, and women empowering themselves. Every single song on this track is awesome--my favorites are \\"Beautiful\\" \\"Dirrty\\" \\"Infaturation\\" Get Mine Get Yours\\" \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" & \\"I'm OK\\". I give the girl props for doing what she loves!!! Everyone needs to get this album!
0679721037|5.0|In America we are never shown the human side or the after affects of the Atomic Bomb.  We are only told that it ended the war and saved countless American soldiers lives.<br />This book sheds some light on the human side and the Japanese view of what happened.  The fact that nearly 100,000 people had been killed or doomed in one blow and 100,000 more injured in a city of 245,000 is something to contemplate in itself.  The human tragedy is explored a bit in this book.  The wounds, the eybrows burned off, the eyes melted out of their sockets, skin hanging from faces and hands.  Vomiting and burn patterns on bodies.  It can be a bit gruesome but it is important to know the devestation that this bomb brought.  The after effects of radiation poisoning and the lifelong health problems of many of the survivors are explored.  The increased rates in cancer and luekemia are discussed. <br />This is an eye opening book that tells the story of 6 different survivors.  The horrors in the aftermath of the Atomic explosion.  The human side, the emotions, the injuries, the recovery and rebuilding.  Told through the eyes of normal everyday people.  The story is engrossing.  <br />I highly recommend this book be read by many.  Although I think they should read others on the subject as well to see the entire picture.  This book covers the human perspective but not the political or military perspective.  A very interesting read.
B000002J6F|5.0|I saw Manassas live when this album debuted 30 years ago and was blown away.  It still blows me away.
B00005JL2O|2.0|It's sad, really. Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, was a great movie. Full of site gags, puns, and making full use of the clichés of the spy genre, it was great.<br />Then, they made Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me. Which was good, but... The edge was gone. The jokes were cruder, and although I don't really mind toilet humor, it only gets you so far. It made many references to the prior film, but it only reminded you of how much better it was the first time. And Fat Bastard was one of the worst charecters ever to see the light of day.<br />Then, they made Austin Powers In Goldmember. The product I'm here to tell you about. I was excited when I saw the first trailer for it: a parody of the opening the original, with Mini-Austin Powers. Unfortunatly, most of the thinking done by the creators went into that trailer, at the expense of the movie.<br />How bad is it? Not only did they keep Fat Bastard, but they added another Myers charecter, Goldmember, that is somehow worse. And as for the toilet humor... If you like that sort of thing, at the exculsion of all other forms of jokes, you're in heaven. The rest of us are going to be dissapointed. There are some breaks-the star studded opening works well, and there are other clean laughs. But it's nothing to write home about. And, as before, every thing that hearkens back to a prior film is a shadow of its former self.<br />It's all too common to see series go down hill, but it's rare to see such a rapid decline as has befallen Austin Powers. I shudder to imagine a fourth. Coming soon. Austin Powers: You only Shag Twice.
B000002VCQ|4.0|The album, being a first, is incredibly well-crafted, written and produced in order to suit a young girl's dreams (THINKING ABOUT YOU, HOW WILL I KNOW?), loves (NOBODY LOVES ME LIKE YOU DO), disillusions (ALL AT ONCE, SAVING ALL MY LOVE FOR YOU) and hopes (GREATEST LOVE OF ALL, HOLD ME) thru lyrics and music and duets.<BR>The winner of this collection to me will always be TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY HEART.<BR>She definitely took good care of mine , let her do the same to yours.<BR>Enjoy
0920668372|5.0|\\"I'll love you forever. I'll like you for always.  As long as I'm living my baby you'll be\\".  This saying is repeated on just about every page.  This is a very great book for younger kids.  It explains that not everything stays the same forever, yet some things still do.  The story is about a baby and his mother and how the baby changes as he grows up but the mother still sings him the song no matter how old he is.  The story shows the major ages of a person's life; 2, 9, a teenager, a grown man, and an older man in his mid ages.  It starts out he's just a little baby.  Then he is two and runs all over the house and flushes his moms watch down the toilet.  He grows and he grows until he's 9 years old and he doesn't want to come in for dinner or listen to his mom.  The story keeps on going until he is an older man and his mom is sick and very old. He goes over there and rocks her back and forth, back and forth and as he rocked her he sang...\\"I'll love you forever. I'll like you for always.  As long as I'm living my baby you'll be\\".  So I think it was a very good book for young readers.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album allows Christina to show her true colors, without any hesitation. Her hits are bangin' from \\"Dirrty,\\" the heart pumping thrill ride to \\"Beautiful,\\" the wonderfully titled self-esteem ballad that should bring tears to all eyes. Christina has grown up and \\"Stripped\\" shows her maturity. I hope her talent will continue to produce wonderful albums like \\"Stripped\\" in the future.
0385503954|4.0|I read all the reviews about the book and I think I was expecting too much.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great book that it well worth the read.  I think it would have been even better if I had not gone into reading as many reviews as I did read.  All that said, it is still way worth the time.

B00006NSZ5|5.0|This disc is awesome! Em's 3 new songs are, in my opinion, the best on the disc. The songs I'm referring to are \\"Lose Yourself,\\" (of course) \\"8 Mile,\\" and \\"Rabbit Run.\\" I never really used to like Eminem, but then, I bought \\"The Eminem Show,\\" and I was instantly hooked! He doesn't b-s the world into thinking that superstardom is the greatest thing, but is honest about his own life, and he just throws reality into every listener's face. I respect him for that. Anyways, \\"Lose Yourself\\" is a perfect theme for the movie, which I CANNOT wait to see. I'm looking forward to seeing how his performance lives up to its hype. Hats off to you, Em! Got another hit with this one! For those of you who don't have it, go out and get it! If you're a fan or you just like Eminem, you won't be disappointed!

When a ghost chaser (Bill Pullman) and his daughter (Ricci) enters the mansion to get rid of the ghosts, Ricci becomes friends with Casper. Meanwhile, Pullman focuses on the 3 other ghosts that &quot;live&quot; in the mansion.  This is first &quot;normal&quot; role for Christina Ricci, who was in the Addams Family movie as Wednesday.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is an amazing CD. Every song is my new &quot;favorite.&quot; Some are edgy and hard-rock, while others are soft, with Avril's beautiful voice shining through. It's also cool because she wears REAL clothes, and sings REAL music (unlike..ahem...Britney and others...) I also respect her because she writes her own MEANINGFUL lyrics! I think that anyone would enjoy having this CD. I know it's one of the best 13 bucks I've ever spent!
6304359217|4.0|Nope, that's Micheal Jordan one of the best basketball players on Earth (and in the cartoon world)<br />  Micheal Jordon, along with other basketballs stars, are in this movie.  Micheal is retired from basketball and he is playing minor leauge baseball.  However, Micheal is bad at baseball.  Wayne Knight, Bill Muary, Larry Johnson and Micheal go to play golf.  It seems Micheal is good at golf, where he makes a hole-in-one shot.  He reaches for the golf ball in the hole, when he gets sucked down the hole and into the world of the Looney Toons. There, he meets Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, the Taszmanian Devil and countless others.  Bugs Bunny needs help from Micheal to win a basketball game, or the Looney Toons will be slaves on Moron Mountain.
0790731479|5.0|Beetlejuice is the story of ghosts (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who can't get along with the family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and Winona Ryder) that moves into their house. The ghosts enlist Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) to help them, and the fun really starts. The movie is directed by Tim Burton. Robert Goulet and Dick Cavett make cameos. The score is by Danny Elfman. This movie has a great cast and a great director.<br />If you're a fan of Burton's other movies, you'll especially like this movie. Like all his movies, it has his distinctive look and feel to it. But anyone can enjoy this far-fetched comedy. Being PG, it should be appropriate for most members of the family. The DVD is lacking some of the special features that I would like to see though - like outtakes, behing-the-scenes, etc...
1563894696|4.0|Let me start by saying this book is not as well written as the Frank Miller Batman stories.  This is due directly to the fact that it is not written by Frank Miller!  If you want a Frank Miller book then buy one.  Otherwise, if you want a Batman story that has brisk pacing, a good plot, a good mystery and a solidly constructed story then this book is for you.  Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale are one of the best duos out there and I have yet to read a subpar release from them.  If you like Batman and want a quick entertaining read you will like this book.
B00006LLNU|5.0|In my opinion, there are two main aspects that makes great music: knowledge of an instrument and the ability to use that to express emotion. With &quot;()&quot;, Sigur Ros continues their conquest of making music that makes the gods think they might be mortal. As with &quot;Agaetis Byrjun&quot; and &quot;Angels of the Universe&quot;, you lose yourself into a plane in which the laws of music theory become null. This album (as well as the forementioned or certain Mogwai tracks) make me want to find someone to love, start a fire in the fireplace, and cuddle on the couch wrapped in a warm blanket. Buy this album. If you don't, I will find you and make you buy it myself.
B000009HF2|3.0|This is Peter Frampton's main claim to fame. Before the release of this record, Peter Frampton was a struggling guitarist/songwriter trying to make it in the music world. He had some good songs but they were known in smaller circles.<br />Somehow this album took off like a rocket. And there are some good songs. Baby I Love Your Way is a beautiful ballad featuring some nice keyboard touches. Do You Feel Like We Do is basically a good song. I just don't care for the extended talkbox guitar riffage which meanders too much for me. Its A Plain Shame grabs my attention more than the rest of the tracks as it is very focused. I Wanna Go To The Sun has some catchy hooks as does All I Want To Be.<br />The rest of the songs are certainly listenableid not quite spectacular. The mixing of the live audience cheering Peter's stage antics definitely livens up the performance. However, as much as it was a million seller in its day, Frampton Comes Alive just hasn't had the staying power over time as many other records would later surpass its sales.<br />Furthermore, Peter seemed to peak out on this Ok but certainly not essential recording. I'm In You was a passable record and subsequent releases are barely even memorable by this reviewer. Nonetheless, this record has its moments but is not a mandatory purchase for your music collection.
B00006V9A0|5.0|i think this is one of the best cds i ever heard, because it includes all the songs i like.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Parents with children..REJOICE! E.T. is on DVD in all its glory. By demand, both versions are in this set, the original and the adapted one.<br />The sound is upgraded and truly spectacular. Maestro John Williams' score still packs the punch it did before, but now in DTS and 5.1 surround. The trademark bicycle screen finds me in greater appreciation as the sound lifts you up, the the music moves you seemlessly through the movie.<br />The picture itself is legendary, so I will not go into that detail, except to say I completely forgot the age Drew Barrymore was at that time, and the excellent job Dee Wallace did in this film.<br />The quality of the video is mesmerizing. Spielberg's use of light and shadow, and the use of movement with sound are even better now in this DVD, and the wider your screen, and more enveloped in this story you will be. Twenty years ago?<br />The newly computerized E.T. and ship in the new version you soon forget as you get into the movie, but its much smoother than the new STAR WARS re-issues. It does NOT affect the storyline, and may actually enhance it since much more can be done.<br />The original version still packs its punch. Yes, its a guy in a suit, but the kids LOVE it. Both are good, with the new version is a lttle more intense since it looks more real and that is all.<br />As an adult, I was quite surprised that I was getting a little \\"misty\\" eyed at the last 20 minutes. The children were virtually mesmerized, never seeing the movie until then so this story wsas like seeing \\"Peter Pan\\" for the first time.  The adults were , lets say, very silent until the end. (err..excuse me..got to get water and such)<br />This version, with its special features, sound, quality, and BOTH versions of the movie is almost mandatory for any family with children, and the child in the rest of us will treasure it to.<br />This may be his best work, and definitely is one of the best of the last 30 years. This is highly recommended.<br />Oh yes..NOT ONE CELL PHONE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE! YEA!CELL PHONE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE! YEA!
B00006J9OT|5.0|What a rush!  This CD is magnificent!!  I  had ordered all of Krall's CD's to date, but the quality and excitement was waning for me until I heard \\"Live in Paris.\\"  More soul, longer improvisations, more piano, and fewer stock orchestral arrangments!  The orchestra is there on some tracks, but very subdued.  \\"Let's fall in Love\\" (Track 1) sets the stage as it rocks on with a driving force.  I also enjoyed the \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" riffs in \\"Deed I Do\\"; \\"East of the Sun\\"; and \\"Devil May Care\\" (listen carefully to her piano choruses and you'll hear her sneak it in!).  Great comeback to the small jazz club atmosphere, even though it's recorded live in a big hall.  I also loved \\"A Case of You\\" -- it's a change for Diana and shows the depth of her talent.  If you haven't bought a Diana Krall CD, start with this one -- you won't be disappointed!
B00006V9A0|2.0|This is a very dry overview of Nirvana's career.  I know the main goal is to assemble all of the hits on to one CD for casual fans intimidated by actual albums, but would it have been so hard to include some of the fan favorites that rank among the groups most essential work, if not their most well-known?  <br />\\"Drain You\\" belongs here.  \\"Polly\\" belongs here.  \\"Aneurysm\\" should be here in some form (it was a hit off the 1997 live album and a highlight of Incesticide).  \\"Love Buzz\\" was always a live staple and one of the standout songs from their debut.  At a time when CD prices are reaching ridiculous new heights and other legendary performers like The Beatles and Elvis are seeing 30-song single-CD career overviews released, the Nirvana best-of CD should have featured a little bit more than it does.  <br />The new song, \\"You Know You're Right\\", is typical Nirvana but enjoyable and emotional nonetheless.  It stinks that hardcore fans will be driven to buy 13 songs they already have for this one new tune, but thats Geffen's plan now, isn't it?
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim...something I do not usually do...what a great experience!  I cannot imagine where this young woman has been, but her voice is amazing!  The mood is relaxing, the sound is smooth and raspy at the same time.  WOW!
B00006V9A0|4.0|After 8 years of nothing after a long, protracted court battle over rights, Nirvana's greatest hits cd is released. It's got everything any Nirvana lover would need. It's got the unforgetable unbeatable songs like, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" \\"Come As You Are\\" \\"Lithium\\" \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" \\"Rape Me\\" \\"Dumb\\" and the new single \\"You Know You're Right.\\" The new single was recorded 3 months before Kurt took his own life. it's unimaginable what the song could have been if it had been headlining a new album but all we have is the fresh and digestable \\"You Know You're Right.\\" it's got a verse like In Utero and a chorus like Nevermind. It's got an erie beginning that sets you in the mood for the rest to jump in your face with a chorus that'll remind you of the days when old nirvana was new and a breakdown in the end that blows your mind. Also in this collection is a remix version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea.\\" the only noticeable difference is an added guitar part at the end. A surprise to me was that the cd ends with the guys jamming to David Bowe's \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" in New York from their acoustic cd. It's ironic that one of the songs on their greatest hits record is not their own song. But overall their greatest hits does them justice. It might not have great songs like \\"Drain You\\" or \\"Anuerysm\\" or \\"On A Plain\\" but it's still a supurb collection. 9/10
B00006V9A0|4.0|What I mean is, Nirvana ceased to be at the highlight of their days.  It's such a same this album had to see the light of day.<br />If you are a Nirvana fan, this is a must get.  The new song is supurb, and the old music sounds better than ever re-mastered.  It brings me back to those days in the 7th grade when I first discovered Nirvana, listening to their Cassette Tapes on the bus!<br />We all love and miss Kurt, and this album does his memory justice.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Probably gettin' enough of Pop and the way boys and girls groups sing, I'm astonished by \\"Stripped\\" - it's definitely more than Pop.  Christina is movin' along with a combination of Pop, R&B, Latin and Soul as her unique style.  With no doubt this young queen is full of gifts.  And I can even reveal some shadows of Mariah Carey from her.<br />Despite the elegant design of \\"Stripped\\", most of the songs are beautifully written.  In addtion, the talented artist has engaged in composing some of the great songs.  With splendid lyrics, great voices, excellent quality and arrangements, this album becomes really worthy.<BR>I highly recommend the songs \\"Infatuation\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Cruz\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\" for a fresh-first-random-listen.<br />Though, personally, I admit the album is a bit too \\"clumpsy\\".  Including all the interludes, there are 20 tracks in total.  It might be a bit too much for a standard music lover like me.<br />As conclusion, this album is fresh and outstanding.  Just give it a whirl!
6305342776|3.0|Ok so THE BLACK HOLE is not STAR WARS, but it is still a decent flick if you are not in a particularly picky mood. It has its moments-some of them wonderful-including some great effects for the time (and for Disney). The dialog is a bit of a clunker, some of the jokes are terrible, but I've heard MUCH worse. I always enjoy Max Schell-a great actor. The rest of the crew is (literally) expendable. I'll never be able to believe Anthony Hopkins going into space. That's too much of a stretch for me! However, the sets for the film are fairly convincing and certainly fun. This film is meant to be a grand adventure. I think some detractors need to loosen their belts a bit and just...r-e-l-a-x. The DVD transfer is quite good and clean. The sound is nothing to brag about. Neither are the extras for that matter. But so what. This is a nice diversion for a couple of hours.
B00005K3OT|3.0|A sweet story, based on a better novel. This falls in that food meets sex and gets blurry genre that the Nigella Lawson crowd loves so well. The actors and actresses are cute, the locations lovely, Judy Dench rules the world, the food bits quite tasty to watch and the story moves along nicely.<br />I think the thing that gets me about it is that it is supposed to be French, but it is so Americanized that I found myself wondering if they filmed it in Disneyland.  Also, the pat, happy ending is very American. <br />I await the fusillade of negative votes from people who liked the movie. Fire away mes amis!
078322608X|5.0|You know a film is good when you come out of the theater discussing it with friends.  You know it's really good when you come out of the theater in *silence*, afraid to break the quiet by asking any questions at all.  I found myself still thinking about this film YEARS after seeing it.  I thought the actors did a great job, but the *ideas* in the film are what I keep coming back to.  The juxtaposition of the vibrant world of Madeline Stowe's character and Bruce Willis' character is stunning.  And going thru the experience with Willis keeps you on the edge of your seat as you hope against all odds that SOMEONE, anyone, will take him seriously.  David Morse also does a great job here.  He plays nice guys well (the father in CONTACT), but I like him more when he's a meanie.<br />Gilliam's direction is once again solid throughout-he guides the film with an expert's touch.  There is a lot going on here-I had to see the film two or three times to pick up on most of the stuff.  I still see new things each time I watch it.  The DVD transfer is great and the sound is good too.  I like the extras as well.  A must-see.<br />Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|2.0|You know, I'll be completely serious. If you listen to the likes of Britney Spears or any other of those fabricated pop stars, chances are, this will soon be your favorite C.D. But if you listen and the next day you go to school, you're wearing leather spikey thingys and claiming to be punk when just the day before, you were walking around in an abercrombie and fitch shirt and LEI jeans, you just got the wrong idea. AVRIL LAVIGNE IS NOT A PUNK AND WILL NEVER BE A PUNK! She is just a regular pre-fab pop star. The only diffrence is that instead of looking like a whore and singing to dance music, she dresses \\"punk\\" and has some band behind her. So look, I'm not saying don't buy the C.D., I'm just saying don't take her the wrong way.
B00003CX95|5.0|BRAVEHEART is a marvelous film, full of love, pain, vigor, fright, and bravado.  It remains Mel Gibson's crowning achievement.  While certain details of the story are suspect, the arching narrative is so powerful and affecting, it's hard not to become enveloped inside.  The characters are wonderful and the cinematography is among the best in film history.<br />This DVD offers a nice round of extras for the film buff, lots of commentary and trailers-the standard fare.  This is an essential DVD for all film libraries.  As an aside, I find inspiration in Gibson's character.  I'm sure many guys want to have the convictions and strength of William Wallace.  I am no exception.  I try to live by his famous line &quot;Every man dies, not every man really lives.&quot;<br />Highly recommended.
B00006CXXU|5.0|THIS IS ONE HECK OF AN ALBUM!!! First of all, dont let her single \\"DIRRTY\\" trick you. The whole album is nothing like that song. This album is really GREAT. Dirrty is a great song, but DEFINITELY not the only one. Xtina shows that SHE IS ONE HECK OF A singer. Some of the highlights of the album in my opinion: Cant Hold Us Down (w/ Lil Kim), Loving Me 4 Me, Impossible, Beautiful, Make Over, Soar (one of my favorite songs on the album!), and Keep On Singin My Song. This is NOTHING like her debut album....and she wrote every song except for BEAUTIFUL, which was written by Linda Perry. The lyrics are so good as well! This in my opinion is a \\"new version\\" of Janet Jackson's THE VELVET ROPE, which is another album i would highly recommend! Inspirational, awesome, just pure GREAT are the words that would describe this album.... she has what it takes to be just like Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey without a doubt!!!!
B00003CXPJ|2.0|That's the problem with this film.  It has its moments but they are few and far between.  It is really just the same joke over and over.  Owen Wilson was funny at times, but overall this was a waste of time.  The idea of satirizing the fashion industry is a good one, but does not maintain momentum over a full length feature film.  Is anyone really surprised by this!?
6305132984|1.0|There are several old movie musicals that hold up ... this isn't one! Some of the music is good, though enormously derivative, hence the one star. Two scenes have some life in them still: the 'officer krupke' song and 'america'. Everything else is tedious, unreal, awful, sappy ... and it's full of 35-year-old 'teenagers', this movie needs a remake: with a changed ending, the loss of a few songs, better choreography (it's so bad now ... I don't understand my memory of it being exciting, at the time it came out ...), and more reality: a better re-creation of that time ... the directors did not have an eye for their own time at all!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This brand new album is one of the best I heard this year. It really got a little something for everyone. First single DIRRTY was the best song to pick for release... This is the kind of song that everybody is talking about, the video is, well... you know. She had to do all that for publicity, but second single BEAUTIFUL, will be huge. We already knew how strong Christina's voice was. She is now stronger in every single way. No matter what we say.<br />CAN'T HOLD US DOWN: Very strong lyrics, this is a kind of answer to Fred Durst, Eminem... With special guest LIL'KIM, very well done and right on time with all these independent womans.<br />POSSIBLE: Produced by Alicia Keys, this song could be a single. But I don't know if Christina's fans are ready for this kind of song. But the new adults fans should appreciate it.<br />BEAUTIFUL: Linda Perry can be proud of this song. This song is really simple, the lyrics are beautiful and Christina is doing an amazing job on it.<br />CRUZ: Another Linda Perry penned song. This one could have been on Pink's M!ssundaztood album. Very similar to a few hits we already know.<br />DIRRTY: The stripped first single. The song is hot, the video is, well... you all saw the video. Perfect first comeback single.<br />A VOICE WITHIN: That is the song Mariah should have record instead of Loverboy. The vocals are amazing. This one blew me away.<br />KEEP ON SINGING MY SONG: Christina is kind of making a promise in this album... \\"Say goodbye to all the tears and cry...\\" I feel like the next album will be happier than stripped.<br />All the songs on this album are worth listening to. If this album was a book, I would say... Don't judge a book by its cover.<br />Christina, you should be proud of this album. Thanks to all the amazing people who worked with you, Glen Ballar, Linda Perry, Scoth Torch, Rockwilder, Lil'kim, Redman and many others...
B00006NSZ5|5.0|We all know how good Eminem's flows are in the song \\"Lose Yourself\\" are. The #2 song on the album, \\"Luv Me\\", featuring Eminem, Obie Trice and 50 Cent has a nice, kind of almost love ballad, female chorus. The three of them sound great together. I feel that song #3, featuring Eminem in \\"8 Mile\\", definately has the making of another single. It may not be the next single off the album though. Song #11, 50 Cent's \\"Wankster\\", I think will be his breakout single and the album's second single. It has a fresh sound and his voice is melodic at times. Song #6 \\"Rap Game\\" features D-12 (including Eminem). This is a very good song, and contains one of my favorite Eminem's verses on the album. The other great songs on this album are by NAS, 50-Cent, Macy Gray, and Young Zee. Zee's \\"My Nigga for Real\\" and 50-Cent's \\"Places To Go\\" bump nicely in the car.
B00006CXXU|5.0|No matter what you thought of the controversial single, &quot;Dirrty,&quot; you may very well like, no you may very well love, this album. This is a fabulous album that alternates from smooth r&amp;b to hard rocking songs to latin and back to bluesy r&amp;b again. This is nothing like her last album; it's much, much better. It's not really very &quot;dirrty&quot; at all. It's open, passionate, empowered and intense. Outstanding tracks include: Infatuation, Beautiful, Impossible (by Alica Keys), Loving Me 4 Me and Fighter.

0385720920|5.0|Like most of his fans, I was turned on to Chuck Palahniuk through Fight Club, the movie not the book.  I have seen it over 20 times, possibly over 30.  It was a masterpiece to be sure, and made me - like so many others - want to read the book.<br />So I did.<BR>And loved it.<BR>I wanted more.<br />So I went to my local library, looking to pick up another Palahniuk book, and Choke was the only one on the shelf - the rest were all checked out.  I opened it to the first page, and began reading it right there in the Om-Pl aisle of the fiction section.  Upon reading the \\"do not read this book\\" opening, I was hooked.  I could have stood there reading until the last page.  One thing you have to say about Chuck is that he knows how to catch your attention quick.<br />Less than twenty four hours later, I had finished Choke.  That was yesterday.  I have to admit, I puzzled over just what to make of it.  I unquestionably was entertained.  Hell, I could have kept reading through an earthquake.  But, I wasn't sure what Chucky was trying to tell us, what his message was, what we should learn from Victor Mancini.  If anything.  What could you learn from a sex-addicted man whose mother is in an insane asylum, whose best friend is a sex-addict that collects rocks to keep from masturbating?  A man who goes to restaurants and pretends to choke in order to make money and who may or may not be the Lord and Savior?<br />Plenty, as it turns out.  I won't tell you what my take on this is, because it will not be the same for you.  As in Fight Club, everyone sees a different moral to the story.  Some will see none, no redeeming qualities.  It's up to you.<br />Just ask yourself:  What would Jesus NOT do?
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark Knopfler's solo albums have been more stylistically varied than his work with Dire Straits, with forays into Celtic, Cajun and other sounds.<br />In &quot;The Ragpicker's Dream&quot;, Knopfler continues this musical wandering.  It's less electric than previous albums, with lots of blues, country and spiritual elements, resulting in a very traditional American feel.  At the same time and perhaps ironically, Newcastle and Northumberland figure very prominently in the album's lyrics (for instance, in &quot;Why Aye Man&quot; and &quot;Fare Thee Well, Northumberland&quot; -- a Geordie stuck in in old-time musical America, singing songs of home.<br />The music and songwriting are excellent throughout.  The album is memorable, distinctive, and eminently singable.
B00005JKDR|5.0|When it comes to movies and esspecially ones that are cartoons you think to yourself....&quot;oh great another movie for kids...when are they ever going to think of the adults for once?&quot;  Well, you wish is Pixar and Disney's latest command with Monster's Inc.

These two monsters are with this company called Monster's Inc and they scare children for energy for the plant....it is like a nuclear plant yet not axactly. There is a compitition all the time of who can have the most screams on the scream chart at the end of the work shift and Sully is always in compitition with this wormy guy which I forget the name of.  Anyways as Sully is in compitition with &quot;the worm&quot;  he finds the worm trying to sneak a few more screams in so that he can be at the top and when Sully tries to get rid of the evidence the evidence becomes friends with him and doesn't want to go back and sully doesn't want to let the little girl who escapes go back. <BR>     This movie is alot more on DVD format with the little outtakes that are really good to the games for the kids.  There is also two little short films one is &quot;For The Birds&quot; and the other is &quot;Mike's New Car&quot;.  Do yourself the favor and buy this movie and snuggle up as a family and laugh together and enjoy
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has definitely come into her own. Don't be fooled by her first single, Dirrty, if you miss her &quot;old&quot; sound. It's still there, along with a mix of other styles on this CD. Let's just say I find this CD very well done and very honest.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Nirvana burst onto the music scene in late 1991 with \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" which was taken from their second album Nevermind.  The song became more than just a top ten hit, it became the anthem for Generation X.  It captured the apathy the youth (especially twenty somethings) were feeling and it crystallized the Seattle grunge sound.  Lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain became the posterboy for the grunge movement and it was a label he would have a tough time dealing with.  Mr. Cobain experienced much pain in his short life and it is his pain that drives his music.  Nirvana's first greatest hits album collects the band's classics like \\"Rape Me\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"Come As You Are\\" and \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", but its main draw to long time Nirvana fans is the new song \\"You Know You're Right\\" which was the last song the group ever recorded.  Due to legal hassles between Krist Novoselic & Dave Grohl and Mr. Cobain's widow Courtney Love, song has been in limbo, but it finally has seen the light of day.  The song fits right in among the well known Nirvana songs, but its value comes from the haunting fact that this was the last song ever laid down by the group that became the Beatles of their generation.
B00006CXXU|3.0|What a shame ! \\"Dirrty\\" is totally the opposite of all the \\"Stripped\\" album. This cd is almost made of smooth ballads as we know Christina before ... Let's see a little bit about the album ... (Sorry but I didn't rate the interludes because I don't think they were needed on the album ...)<br />1. CAN'T HOLD US DOWN (FEAT. LIL'KIM) ... A hot pop/r&b song who's close to \\"Dirry\\" but that is more interresting to listen to. 5/5<br />2. WALK AWAY ... A pretty good ballad that shows Christina in good shape vocally. 4/5<br />3. FIGHTER ... One of the best songs on this cd. It's solid pop/rock that will just wanna make you move. 5/5<br />4. INFATUATION ... Kind of a new \\"Genie In A Bottle\\". A little bit exotic, but too close to Christina's first album. 3.5/5<br />5. LOVING ME 4 ME ... Seriously, I heard a lot of better r&b songs than this. Very, very, very ordinary. 2/5<br />6. IMPOSSIBLE ... I love the Alicia Keys's piano in this song but I would prefer Keys to sing it. 3/5<br />7. UNDERAPPRECIATED ... A mix of pop and r&b that gives something good, but ordinary at the same time. 3/5<br />8. BEAUTIFUL ... The title says it all. A beautiful ballad where we find Christina's warm voice. 4/5<br />9. MAKE OVER ... Very interresting ... kind of pop/rock song that makes you shake your head. 4/5<br />10. CRUZ ... A sweet ballad that is too close to Shakira's \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\". 3/5<br />11. SOAR ... A good pop song that has something special that makes it not that much ordinary. 4/5<br />12. GET MINE, GET YOURS ... Another pop/r&b song that rocks. 4/5<br />13. DIRRTY ... Haaaa ! Here it is ! Christina's controversy. With those lyrics and that video ... she's just not that sweet little Christina that we knew. The song is awesome but the video does not help the song and Christina ... anyway ... 5/5<br />14. THE VOICE WITHIN' ... A strong and deep ballad from Christina. Pretty good. 4.5/5<br />15. I'M OK ... Probably Christina's best song on the album. She has made such a evolution to her voice in particular in this song that makes think about life and makes think that Christina is an awesome singer. 5/5<br />16. KEEP ON SINGIN' MY SONG ... The last song ... and we were waiting a little bit more about it but it's kinda good. 3.5/5<br />Finally, with \\"Stripped\\" Christina showed a new side of her personnality most of it vocally and lyrically but musically, in my opinion, I was waiting for more and that's probably why I was a little bit disapointed about this cd. Anyway, it's entertaining and ... well... entertaining ... For real fans only !
0226443213|5.0|What weather phenomenon kills the most people in America?  Hurricanes?  Tornadoes?  Floods?  Add those up and they will still not total the deaths attributed to the real killer: heat waves.  The other phenomena yield good pictures, and that is one reason you don't hear much about heat deaths.  But according to Eric Klinenberg, an assistant professor of sociology at New York University, there is another, more subtle reason.  Victims of a heat wave \\"are primarily social outcasts - the elderly, the poor, and the isolated - from whom we customarily turn away.\\"  In _Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago_ (University of Chicago Press), Klinenberg has looked at the week-long heat wave of July 1995, which killed over 700 people.  (Another comparison: the famous Chicago fire of 1871 killed about three hundred.)  In Chicago, the heat hit up to 106 degrees, with a heat index over 120.  Cars broke down in the streets, and bridges, rails, and roads buckled.  Even with the windows open, brick homes could heat up to 120 degrees.  The heat killed, but it did not just kill randomly.  In clear, objective, but often biting pages, Klinenberg shows the patterns of urban life that brought death to certain regions and certain social groups.<br />One group was the elderly, clearly disproportionately killed by the heat.  This might be attributed simply to their bodies having fewer physiological resources to protect them.  Indeed, the government of Chicago tried to explain the deaths of elders this way; the heat only culled those who were going to be dying soon anyway.  There is no medical evidence that this was the case; they simply were unconnected with society, and when they died alone in their rooms, it was long before absences were noticed.  Klinenberg argues forcefully that the Chicago government, at different levels, did not respond to the disaster as it would have a big fire or a train wreck.  When deaths mounted, Mayor Daley was able to frame the issue as a \\"debate\\" about the rising number of deaths, when there was no scientific controversy about the matter.  Human Services Commissioner Daniel Alvarez did a classic move of blaming the victim, saying, \\"We're talking about people who die because they neglect themselves. We did everything possible. But some people didn't want to even open their doors to us.\\"  The media also come in for criticism.  They took up the artificial controversy generated by the mayor about whether the heat deaths were \\"real\\" or not.  There was little analysis about which regions were being the most affected and why, and the official city version of how little could be done against an act of God was repeatedly parroted.  By the time the reporters did a comprehensive story, it was \\"old news\\" and didn't run.<br />No one was more forgotten than forty-one victims whose bodies no one claimed or cared about.  They languished in the county morgue until August, when they were buried in a huge common trench in a potter's field.  Visiting the site in preparation for the book, Klinenberg learned that a few reporters had come now and then to see it, but no Chicagoans and no family members.  Social and governmental forces can't control the heat, he reminds us, but they can make deaths easy to overlook and forget.  His book is a pointed effort to keep that from happening.ut the rising number of deaths, when there was no scientific controversy about the matter.

B000001DVD|5.0|Def Leppardfs second album became much fuller and finer than their debut, On Through The Night, which in itself is excellent. Bringing On The Heartbreak, which was rearranged as the single in 1984, was my first encounter with Def Leppard. It has the very melodic edge as seen in later works. Although it is not as dramatic as Hysteria it is highly recommended for wide range of melodic rock fans as well as music fans who love either their latest X or Vault, the greatest hits.
B000002KIK|1.0|Not just Sabbath, I mean ANY album !What a piece of garbage.  Not even worth downloading from Kaaza.  I only hope the used CD shop will give me $2 for it
B000065JNX|4.0|As a devoted Ralph Fiennes fan, i just had to watch this film. Don't let the length scare you,the story is well transferred into the movie and it may seem boring in the beginning but give it a chance, it gets better.<BR>Tragic love, tragic ending, but still, i would definitely recommend it - it's not typical WW2 love story, the main character, Almasy, is somewhat mysterious and makes you wonder about his true nature througout the entire film. <BR>Wonderful acting by Ralph and the 2 main women characters in the film, Kristin Scott Thomas and of course, Juliette Binoche.<BR>Get the DVD, you won't regret it!
B000002KIK|1.0|And I don't mean worst SABBATH album either.  I really dug the live version of \\"Never Say Die\\" on Ozzy's \\"Speak of the Devil\\" live album.  I also really started to get into Sabbath as a whole so I bought this album.  This is the worst piece of garbage I ever heard.  I can't believe they bouced back with such strong albums as \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\".  Anyway, I only hope the used CD place will give me 2 bucks for it.  I wouldn't even waste your time downloading from Kaaza!
B00005JLKB|5.0|Ever since the pilot episode of \\"Smallville\\" came on, I was instantly hooked. And also ever since then, I've been watching the show every Tuesday night and have not missed an episode. \\"Smallville\\" is the story of the teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling), living in the town of Smallville, Kansas, who will one day be known to the world as \\"Superman\\". In the first season, we learn that Clark is an alien with super powers. He has amazing abilities such as super-strength, can run as fast as the speed of light, and has X-ray vision. But all Clark wants is to be able to fit in with the rest of his peers. He is also trying to win over the affection of the beautiful Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk), who is dating their high school's football star, Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson). Clark lives with his human adoptive parents, Martha Kent and Jonathan Kent (Annette O'Toole and John Schneider) on the Kent Farm, and befriends the rich Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), after he saves Lex from a car accident. Clark also has two other friends, Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) and Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack), who help him out. <br />The plots in every episode keep getting better and better. The storyline is amazing and every actor is superb in their roles. The special effects are great, too. I really hope they bring \\"Smallville\\" to complete season DVDs because it really is one of the best shows out there right now. Even beats out \\"Alias\\", though \\"Alias\\" is a good show, too.<br />I highly recommend \\"Smallville\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
B00006690G|5.0|I hate rap music in general--most of it lacks substance--but when it comes to Eminem, I cannot help but like him.  As he himself has stated many times, the fact that he is white, uncommon among rappers, could have something to do with it, but it is his skills that I like the most.  He is the rhyme master as I see it, able to make words do exactly what he wants them to do.  The rhythms, most of them created by Dr. Dre, are almost always amazing, interacting perfectly with the lyrics.  I do not understand the criticism he receives, because he definitely has not said things in his songs that countless other musicians have not said before him.  I used to dislike Eminem simply because of his image, but when I started to actually listen to him, I decided that he was much better than I at first thought.  There is a line from the opening track \\"White America\\" that I wonder about.  At the end of the song, after visciously stating his opinions about America, he says, \\"I'm just playin', you know I love you America.\\"  I think that he says this just to stop critics from attacking him for this song.  If such is the case, he needs to stop apologizing, because he is right--his agressors are wrong.
0783114222|5.0|Wanted more after 'Apollo 13' Glad Tom Hanks did, too. Something for everyone here. While it is important to note that this is a docudrama, I'd say a valuable historical record was created. Seems to have better production values than 'Apollo 13'
0131103628|5.0|&quot;The C Programming Language&quot; is NOT a book for beginning programmers, or for those very new to C who wish to learn gradually. It is not much of a tutorial. It's written for either very experienced programmers coming from other languages, or for those who know the basics of C and need a reference book. The descriptions and examples are terse, and the learning curve is steep. Once you are comfortable programming in C, however, this is the one book you want next to you (and it will likely be the ONLY reference book you will ever need for straight ANSI C). Since it was written by the original authors of the C language, it's hard to imagine anyone being more authoritative on the subject, and although there's little hand-holding, it is well-written and pleasant enough to read through cover-to-cover. When you're ready to really get your hands dirty, do not hesitate to order this book.

B00006WKSZ|4.0|when the 80,s rock scene is reviewed,the scorpions must be mentioned as one of the biggest draws,and its best exponents.this album dates back to the late 70's and a slightly different line up to the hurricane rock roster.it gives a good view into their past and the sound as it was.the main difference is the presence of Uli Jon Roth on the lead guitar,a man much influenced by Hendrix in his style as opposed to the later explosive work of Matthias Jabs.live ,they are awesome and the Japanese crowd respond well to tracks from their catalogue.the only downside is the singing of Roth instead of leaving the duties to Klaus Meine.this aside ,it is a solid live performance and gives that insight to a bands past before the changes that took them to be rock legends.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I'm gonna keep this simple, since most of you know what to expect with these blokes.  Track 4 (The &quot;Nothing Song&quot; or &quot;Njosnavelin&quot; from the end of Vanilla Sky), track 5, track 7 and track 8 make this one worth the money.  Otherwise (though some may call this unfair), doesn't quite measure up to album #2.  You have to wait nearly 40+ minutes to get to the ROCK, but when you get there, it seems worth it.
B00000064G|5.0|Nick Drake was nothing short of a genius in the 70s and I'm just getting to know him like he was still here, alive and well, and still making music. This makes me angry. <br />Why couldn't he have been saved from depression? Why wasn't his music promoted more heavily? And... why the hell has it taken so long for his music to be heard and appreciated? I see why start-up songwriters and bands are publishing their songs to the web and bypassing traditional avenues.<br />I hope that Nick Drake's family is finally enjoying the fact that many tousands of us now know what they have known all along; Nick was --and is again-- a great gift to us the music lovers, who have been fortunate enough to find him.<br />I've owned this album, his third and final, for over a year now and it still moves me as much as it did when I played it for the first time. Nick was unique, his lyrical style and vocal delivery is unlike anything I've ever heard. Couple this with his approach to accoustic guitar and you suddenly realize two things: a whole generation of people were robbed of him and that Unplugged was not invented by MTV.<br />All I can say is thanks to the Advertising Gurus at Volkswagen for causing a buzz, Hannibal Records for bringing Nick back, and thank god for the Internet and Amazon.<br />You've made it Nick, now rest in peace my friend.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I bought this cd about one or two years ago.I started getting into hendrix about 9th grade about 3 years ago when one of my friends sayed you gotta listen to this and played &quot;purple haze&quot; and I didnt really dig it that much I just overlooked it.After I heard it like 4 or 5 more times and like 6 months had passed before my buddy first played hendrix and it just clicked like omg this guitar playin is awesome.<br />So if you listen to it once and say &quot;well its not my thing&quot; I thought the same thing and it just hit me one day listening to his song.He's been my favorite guitarist and songwriter since ,well him and kurt cobain.I started playing guitar back like 3 and a half years ago and just playing hendrix songs are so awesome.Alot of people say &quot;why are you into hendrix?&quot; cause im young ,and I don't know.<br />The music is just so ahead of it's time and just makes me look at music completely different.Like back in the 60's the music he played was lightyears ahead of what was goin on then.I can't just imagine what kind of music he wouldve made if he was alive today.<br />I would say my favorite song and this is hard cause really all of his songs are my favorite but I would say &quot;little wing&quot; and &quot;castles made of sand&quot;.I know how to play both those songs and its so awesome just recrating masterpeices like that on my guitar.If you haven't heard of hendrix this is the cd to get.Im serious if you really haven't heard of him or really just dont wanna pay the money to buy his cd believe me get off your hiney and go get this cd.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album has some of Kurts better songs that are now remastered. It also has \\"You Know You're Right\\" the unreleased Nirvana song, and probably in the top 5 best songs they've ever recoreded. This album, like all Nirvana albums, is a masterpeice. You'll never skip a track, and you'll never tire of it.
B00005QZ82|5.0|I love this movie. It is so funny and romantic. Meg Ryan is awesome in this movie, she is so cute, you can't help just feel like your in her shoes or something. She really rocks in this movie. Kevin Kline, you fall in love with his personality. He pulls off a great French accent. Also, he is hilarious. Everytime I watch this movie, I just feel like I want to go to France. Great job, worth every penny. Get it, it's worth it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I totally love the album...even though she reveals more of herself not only dropping clothes but she opens her heart and soul to her fans. Such songs that stand out on the album are \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"I'm Ok\\". I know she is trying to show who she really is but her music really stands out on this and that is what really counts...if you haven't picked up this album then you really should. There'll never be another one like it. Her talents are really beginning to show through and I think this is one of her best. 2 thumbs up Christina!!! - Morgan
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Honestly, I feel like a big schlub for the simple fact that I had never heard this album until about two weeks ago.  I knew \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\", \\"Clampdown\\", and the title track of course, but I was not prepared for the high quality of songwriting, playing, and studio technique.  I'm one of those freaks who bought SANDINISTA first, so I kind of have to look at LONDON CALLING through that lens, as well as the first two albums.  It's definitely closer to SANDINISTA in its stylistic diversity (latin, folk, big band jazz, and of course reggae) but a ... of a lot tighter (both conceptually and musically) than that record.  I mean, how do you get any better than \\"Spanish Bombs\\"?  Awesome.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I couldn't wait for her follow-up album to come out, although it took like 2 years. I have been anticipating for this, and I wasn't disappointed. Christina has broken away from the poppy type music and evolved her music into a more r&amp;b/jazz/hiphop genre.  I love this cd, except for her songs Soar and Cruz, I just couldn't flow with it. The rest is awesome. My favorite song is Make Over b/c of its upbeat/rockpop vibe. This album can really get you moving physically, such as the duet/Lil Kim. There is also a sultry part to this album with the song love me 4 me.  This can also get you emotionally moved with her own sad story of i'm ok. This album can definitely be played from beginning to end, except for soar and cruz which i could do without. This album is truly faceted of the many sides of miss Christine, with sad and happy luv songs, personal ballads, physical emotional songs, and anthems for the ladies; there is no way anyone couldn't relate to any one song off this album.
0792835050|3.0|I rented this after having read the book, so my opinion is biased toward the excellent book.  But this actually follows the book closely.  The VHS quality was typically washed out somewhat, so the DVD would be a better experience.  Donald Sutherland does a good job portraying the Nazi spy.  The story is fast-paced and suspenseful.  Another example of good suspensful, political/war thrillers from the 70s.  While not on par with the book, it's a pretty good way to pass a couple hours.
B000000W3G|5.0|These are the tiny, fleeting moments in life where you consider that God may actually exist.  I was browsing through a record store, checking out the boxed sets.  As usual, nothing exceptional.  Just your token Elvis, Sinatra...hold on a second, that's the Smashing Pumpkins!  What's THIS doing here?  So, I buy it, and I put in the &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; single first, and listen.  It's good.   Very good.  Hey, cool, they did a Cars song.  Then, my head flies dramaticaly towards the stereo when I hear the opening line to &quot;A Night Like This&quot; (I'm a huge Cure fan, you see).  All the songs on all the singles are excellent.  If you ever happen apon this very cool looking boxed set, by all means, cough up the fifty or so bucks and take this home.  You'll thank me.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Don't compare them to Radiohead.  This is some of the most heartfelt and groundbreaking music you'll hear (and heartfelt and groundbreaking almost never go together).  Comparing it to movies, YOSHIMI is like what would happen if Kubrick and Spielberg had made an amazing movie together (ummm...more amazing than AI).  Their last album THE SOFT BULLETIN was heralded as brilliant by critics internationally (and those who didn't, quickly felt the cold hand of isolation) and this release is getting very similar treatment.  Both YOSHIMI BATTLES THE PINK ROBOTS and THE SOFT BULLETIN are brilliant and accessible so check 'em out.
0385484518|4.0|This book is great I really liked. It was hard to put it down, I felt specially toched by the telgram Morrie had to read to his father when Morrie's mother had past away. Morrie's memmorie will go on with this great book. I wish that I would get the great oppourtunity to meet such a great teacher. I plan to be a teacher myself and he has motivated me into being a great teacher.I recomend that you not only read but add this book to your home library!!!
B00005JK8K|1.0|It's a shame that a movie so awful should depict the courageous effort of the Navajo during WWII. Storyline, acting and directing are of the worst caliber I have yet seen in a movie. Don't waste your time.
B000031WD9|4.0|\\"American Pie\\", directed in 1999 by Paul Weitz, tells the story of four male high school seniors on their quest to lose their virginity on prom night.  Oz (Chris Klein), Jim (Jason Biggs), Finch (Eddy Kaye Thomas) and Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) even go so far as to make a pact out of it, promising to help each other as they search for easy prom dates.  While Oz finds a cute choir girl in Heather (Mena Suvari) and real love and affection, Kevin spends the last three weeks trying to win back his steady girlfriend Vicki (Tara Reid).   Jim has a close encounter with an apple pie and a foreign exchange student before ending up with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), a band geek who \\"this one time at band camp....\\"...Finally, Finch spreads untrue rumors about his \\"equipment\\" only to have it go to waste and end up with ...  Overall, I actually enjoyed this movie, even considering its gross- out humor.  This story is from an obvious male perspective, and many of the jokes are geared towards a more masculine humor.  \\"American Pie\\" is about four guys trying to get laid, not the girls they \\"do it\\" with, and the movie reflects that fact.  The most memorable funny scenes all have to do with male masturbation, usually involving Jim, and some object- a sock, an apple pie, whatever.  Or an extra special \\"shot\\" in the beer cup.  But you get the idea.  Even so, I still laughed, and I liked watching the movie.  The reason?  The characters were likeable, almost sweet.  Although the story has its gross moments, it's not a mean-spirited movie.  The guys are all good at heart, and don't want to hurt anyone, they just want to get laid.  It's like the guy you sit with at lunch who makes a huge mess and talks with food in his mouth and spits all over you, but he's still your friend and he's a nice kid.  It's gross, but funny.  Besides, watching becomes almost hypnotic in its grossness.   <BR> \\"American Pie\\" is not dated, but it addresses the subject of sex with a very carefree, humorous tone withlittle if any seriousness.  That in itself, is realistic since many teenagers don't talk about sex seriously.  Another one of the movie's biggest charms is the embarrassment factor- so many of the hilarious scenes involve embarrassment of some sort, often with Jim and his Dad (Eugene Levy).  That type of embarrassment reaches across gender boundaries, and I squirmed in my seat with everyone else during the talks about sex and masturbation with Jim's Dad, especially the one involving the magazines.  So many of the scenes are funny in their realism- many teens can relate to the characters embarrassment and gawkiness not only with their parents, and their partners, but with their bodies.  The focus on Prom Night seemed a bit stereotypical though, at least, it wasn't like that in my high school.<BR>  The ability for teens to relate to the characters is part of the movie's appeal, and explains why as many teen girls as teen guys saw it when it came out in the theatre.  It may not have transformed the audience, but it certainly entertains and enraptures.  \\"American Pie\\" is not about to make a \\"Best Movie Ever\\" list, or win any great awards, but it made me laugh.  I've watched it before, and I will certainly watch it again.
0743216458|5.0|I could not put the book down.  I have always admired the 101st airborne troops, and now more than ever they were truly a band of brothers.  Nothing with the exception of the Ranger force could equal their belief in themselves.  It took a special kind of man, in a special time of this country.  I would recommend the book to almost everyone I have ever known
0316666343|4.0|I read this book stictly because it was one of Amazon's recommendations.  The unique way the story is told by Susie is englightening, funny, sad and intriguing.<BR>I only hope that people that we have lost and loved look down on us and keep us in their hearts like the book proves.<BR>I was so surprised at how it makes you laugh one minute and be in tears the next. Definitely a must-read.
B00006LWSF|4.0|(JMJ - RIP)<br />This is a good album period. The sequence of tracks flows well, the caliber of Mcing is way above average (Rakim, Em, Nas, Jay-Z and Guru all on one album, are you serious?) and, once again Em and his collaborators do not disappoint. For extra measure, Macy Gray and Boomkat are thrown into this impressive roster to provide some soulful light relief.<br />8 Mile begins with the fiery Lose yourself, a very tight track, solid beats and enough anger and emotions on wax to make the late great Tupac Shakur proud. However, Em has to get full props for the unstoppable Run Rabbit Run - don't get put off by the lame title. This song is high octane and demonstrates Mr Mathers' has mastered the vocal ability to play with a track by taking a beat and switching his flow a countless number of times. <br />On Love me, we see the newly signed 50 Cent with the much-improved Obie Trice. Although his ... funny verse (which pokes fun at everyone from D'Angelo to Ashanti ) may kick off some WWF-esque type beef between Murder Inc  and Aftermath(to name a few), 50 Cent shows his value, quality  and compatability with the Aftermath family through his witty lyrics.<br />Nas' (thank goodness) continues his run of throwing some top notch lyrics over some smooth beats on You Wanna Be Me whilst the so-called father of his style Rakim shows why some still call him #1 on RAKIM.<br />Xzibit restores the faith that we once had in him through the solid Spit Shine - fingers crossed that he will come this tight on the upcoming Golden State Project whilst Gangstarr in traditional form produce a very nice track. Guru's lyrics, Premo's beats - can you really ask for more?<br />As said before, this is a good album - everything from the beats to the lyrics are way way way above average - i.e. very good. If you have been into rap for a while, this album will slow down the MTV induced `losing faith in hip-hop' feeling that you may be having. If you're just getting into the artform - please appreciate the fact that you've picked up an album with Rakim and Gangstarr, most importantly, regardless of where you are in the hip-hop time zone - just enjoy the album. It's definitely a good musical investment
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's Stripped is reminiscent of confessional poetry.  She co-wrote and composed all but two of the 16 tracks on the album, which gives weight to the redefinition of herself as an artist.  The next 70+ minutes reintroduce a magnificent singer to her fans.  These songs are real, raw, and honest.  Favorites on this second day of listening to it are \\"Can't Hold Us Down,\\" \\"Fighter,\\" and \\"Beautiful.\\"  The true gems of this album are the last three songs; \\"The Voice Within,\\" \\"I'm OK,\\" and \\"Keep On Singin My Song,\\" which deal with Christina's childhood witnessing domestic abuse and how it has affected her life and career.  She has truly come into her own and I thank her for having the courage to make Stripped.<BR>24-year-old Fan
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina has out done herself with this cd... it is truly amazing... she tried and succeeded in distinguishing herself from the rest of the pop pack... this cd is a very honest look at her emotions... don't be fooled by &quot;Dirty&quot; this cd has a lot of dept... i would highly recommend this cd to all of her new and old fans

B00006J9OT|5.0|Diana Krall is a double dynamo.Her &quot;Live In Paris CD&quot; is reminiscent of the George Shearing and Peggy Lee recording that I bought many years ago.However,Diana plays both parts.On the back of the CD jacket she is referred to as the Queen Of Piano Jazz.She is that as well as a first-rate singer.Even though I own the CD,I feel compelled to don the earphones and listen to it every time I enter a Border's store.It's also my Christmas present to everybody this year.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Rós deliberately left not only all of the songs on this album officialy without title, but the album itself has no name. Their intent was to leave the focus on the songs. Unfortunately, this will backfire and the \\"pretentious\\" word will get thrown around quite a bit. Marketing and packaging (gorgeous) decisions aside, the music is simply sublime. <br />Sigur Rós has been performing all of these songs for at least a year and half. Some have been around since 1999. The result is that their arrangements are extremely tight and polished. The songs have had time to be perfected. They've also had the time to see which songs logically segue into others. () plays as a long crescendo. Starting off with perhaps the quietest song, () twists and builds over 70 minutes. <br />Musically, the album isn't a great departure from Agaertis Byrjun. Minimal and immaculate percussion, pianos, vintage syntesizers, crystalline guitar, and Jonsi's falsetto vocals. On (), the songs are more unified and fluid. Its difficult to not listen to the album straight through. Despite is 70 minute length, () never becomes monotonous either. I can't even begin to pick a favorite individual song; they all have subtle, yet absolute distinctions that are impossible to weigh against eachother. <br />In essence, Sigur Rós continues to do their own thing. Not really comparable to anyone, or within any given scene. Its not music for everyone. Its hard to sing along to lyrics in a nonexistant language. the tempo usually falls somewhere below leisurely. The shortest song is six and half minutes. But if you fall in love with this music you're going to fall hard. There is little else in music right now which contains even a measureable percentage of the beauty in Sigur Rós' music. () will draw your last breath.<br />If you get the chance during November try to catch them live. Its hard to believe they can replicate the sounds they put on record, and yet they manage to exceed them.
B00000637V|5.0|What is often overlooked in judging this bleak but great concept album, is the brilliance of the individual songs. It contains some of Reed's most memorable numbers like the melodic Caroline Says I and II, the tender, wistful Oh, Jim, the heartbreaking The Kids, the desolate The Bed and the majestic Sad Song. Over these beautiful melodies Reed lays his vocals that are so genuine, so apt and so gripping that listening to them is almost like seeing snippets of a movie. Of course, these all fit the complete picture to create one of the most trenchant and vivid concept albums of all time, from the jazzy intro of Berlin through the spoken poem of Lady Day, right to the melancholy last refrains of Sad Song. The full production and lush arrangements add gravitas to the somber mood to create a dark masterpiece of epic proportions. Somewhat inaccessible to some fans, Berlin has nevertheless improved with time and stands as one of Lou Reed's major achievements.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I was a HUGE fan of this show and was so sorry to see it sadly come to an end after only one season.  The characters were wonderful and very true to life as a young adult in the early to mid-90s.  It is a shame that shows like this, and Freaks and Geeks don't last longer - but they remain in the hearts of fans and now with this DVD they can live on forever.  Kudos to the producers, writers, and stars of My So Called Life - you did an awesome job!
B00005RYLE|4.0|This movie is probably one of the most well known and obsessed over horror films of the century. The actor Bruce Campbell is practically a living legend to most horror crazed movie buffs. Personally I think he is a great actor but does a lot better in comedy roles like in \\"Amy of Darkness.\\" I've always liked all Sam Raimi's films but honestly never took the time to watch \\"The Evil Dead\\" until a few weeks ago. I started the \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy backwards with \\"Army of Darkness\\" and flat out loved it. Pure fun and action for any movie fan. Next I saw \\"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\\" and really laughed by a** off. I thought \\"Well if the last two were so great the Original has to be the best!\\" Well, I was sort of right...<br />I began watching \\"The Evil Dead\\" and thought it was running pretty well. Very stylish camera angles, good music by Joe Lo Duca and a great setting. The movie was fine for me until it came to the infamous tree branch scene. I was literally shocked to see how far the scene was taken and really lost allot of respect for the film. Don't get me wrong, I love movies with blood and explosions but that scene just steps too far and ruins the whole thing for me. The scene is duplicated in \\"Evil Dead II\\" in a much better and settling way. That is really the only problem I have with this film. I am not easily rattled by movies but that scene really surprised me. Other than that, the movie is great and once the horror really starts, it never stops. This movie is Not exactly jump out of your chair scary but more like ultra gory horror that makes your jaw drop. It is easy to see why this film is hailed so much by total horror freaks and buffs. <br />To sum things up, this is not your average horror film. It offers more style and edge than you usually see in horror movies. Bruce Campbell is great in his role as Ash and later gets to really show off and be funny with \\"Evil Dead II\\" & \\"Army of Darkness.\\" For all you horror crazed, violence addicted psychos out there this is the movie for you. Still, if you are interested in becoming a filmmaker, like me, you may like this just to see how a bunch of college filmmakers can really pull something off. Just be weary of those woods...
B00005JKHP|3.0|Okay, I admit that I love this movie because it was the first.  The director's edtion is definitely an improvement.  It is still long and slow, but now it is a little tighter.  Not as tedious.  This is a good cerebral story.  Unlike Final Frontier, Generations, and Insurrection.  It really explores ideas that are out there.  That said, it would still have made a better t.v. episode than a movie, but at the time there was not series.  As I understand it, it was to be the pilot of a new series.  This is demonstrated by the t.v. type story.  It is still better that Trek V or any of the TNG movies.  If you haven't seen the director's cut you are missing out.  If you never liked the movie give this version a try.  If you just thought it meandered too much, give this version a try.  I think you will enjoy it.
B00006F7S4|2.0|I expected a lot more this time around.  This CD can only be described as 'lazy', lacking the studio bells and whistles of Odelay, for example.  How many songs can you listen to in which Beck sounds like Perry Como before you either fall asleep or want to turn this off and return to the living world??! .. not many.  The one positive: He did not use his disco falsetto voice on this CD. Thank god.
B0000029DD|5.0|I first started listening to this cd when I borrowed it from a friend around this time last year. I have to admit, that when I first listened to the album I wasn't crazy about it. It was clear the man could sing, but it was almost too much to take in all at once. There were so many layers and the mood changed so much from song to song--from the simple (only vocals accompanied by acoustic guitar) yet achingly beautiful and positively spiritual rendition of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah to the louder, harsher, more in-your-face tones of Eternal Life. Even within the songs themselves Jeff can shift gears in the blink of an eye. Mojo Pin, the first song on the album, is a prime example. He goes from the dreamy longing of the first couple verses to a full out tortured, impassioned cry by the end. When I first heard it my reaction was \\"Whoa there, what just happened? Did he really just do that?' Despite my initial misgivings, for some reason that I'm still unclear about, I kept listening. I was going about my business, Grace was on in the background, it was probably my 6th or 7th time listening to the album in its entirety, and finally something clicked. I \\"got it\\" so-to-speak. A year and several hundred listens later, I am completely and utterly in love with it. No need to go on about his amazing vocal, lyric and technical capabilities as so many others on here have done. I think Jeff himself describes it best, so I'll leave it to him.<br />\\"Relentless, endless joy peaking into tears, resting into calmness, a simmering beauty. If you let yourself listen with the whole of yourself, you will have the pure feeling of flight while firmly rooted to the ground. Your soul can fly outward, stringed to your ribcage like a shimmering kite in the shape of an open hand. Be still and listen to the evidence of your own holiness.\\"<br />\\"It's just about being alive, my songs. And about even emitting sound. It's about the voice carrying much more information than the words do. The fact is,there are so many other areas you can go with other instruments going on at the same time. You can reach a trance-like state where what's really going on inside the human psyche is being sung to... the music aims at what's really going on underneath... not what people pretend to be or what they hope they can buy at a store. The little scared kid or the full-on romantic lover is being accessed. There are really majestic qualities about people that can be reached through music. People are incredible to me even though I'm healthily cynical sometimes. It's because we are spirits and the whole tension is that we don't know that we are. Yet, music is able to touch this.\\"<br />I don't think I could describe the way Grace affects me any better than that. It's music at its best, its most genuine, most passionate, most transcendent. The moral of the story is, buy the album! You won't regret it. And if you do at first, give it some time to sink in. They say the best things in life take time, and Grace is not an exception.
0385484518|5.0|I had to read this book for my sociology class (Soc.275,Marriage and Family). This book was really enlightening and it makes you realize what's important in life. It changes your whole perspective on life and the things you take for granted. It also shows us how we shouldn't stress too much over the petty stuff that happens. It also humbles you because you realize that there's a bigger picture: It's not so much \\"your life\\" but life period. The only thing I regret is that this wasn't on my required reading list for high school.
B000002JK2|4.0|Whereas Rough Mix is little more than a semi-forgettable footnote in Townshend's cannon -- his contributions are passionate but lackluster -- the album delivers three Lane classics: \\"April Fool,\\" \\"Nowhere To Run,\\" and \\"Annie.\\"<br />Lane profits from sidesmen of knowing taste and instrumental virtuosity. Throughout, Clapton and Townshend accompany him in fleshing out some of his most remarkable and moving pieces. In typical Lane fashion, these are deceptively quiet affairs that hide an ingenious musical intelligence and a heightened sensibility. With the help of his eminent cohorts, Lane delivers his contributions with a fuller range of textures and fine playing -- yet never departing from his characteristic rusticity -- aspects sometimes absent from his previous simpler excursions. <br />By contrast, Townshend's input lacks his trademark inventiveness and is too often reflected in songs that only occasionally rise above the ordinary, despite his intensity as a performer. For those in search of the sparkle of Empty Glass, go elsewhere.<br />All said, Rough Mix is unmissable for Lane fans but rather unfertile ground for Townshend's muse.
B00005B5L4|5.0|On one level, this album is nothing more than slightly overengineered, light California pop from the late '70s. For example, the vocal harmonies on Christie McVie's \\"Don't Stop\\" are not far removed from the Beach Boys. Stevie Nicks voice was still cutsie, and lacks the bite which made her so great on the live \\"The Dance\\" DVD. <br />Yet there is a quality about this album transcends the slick pop surface. I think it is because this album is one of contrasts. It may be contrast between the emotional impact of the lyrics and the mystically happy music. Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were breaking up, as were Christine and John McVie. The lyrics deal with difficult emotions, the loss of relationships and the fear of being alone and abandoned -- the anger, wind of uncertainty and self doubt at the end of a significant committed relationship. They stand in brilliantly dark contrast to the slick, polished music which accompanies them. Or perhaps it is the ability of Lindsey Buckingham to rip of a tight, gut renching rock guitar solo in the middle of a light pop tune. Whatever it is which makes this album great, there is no denying that is an essential album in anyone's collection.<br />Why buy the DVD Audio? ...This album is so clean and well recorded and marvelous, I had to have every drop of the master tape. Unfortunately, the CD format did not live up to its promise. The CD format is dry, synthesized and brittle sounding. This is not the case with the the DVD-audio format. It brings back the warmth of the original tapes. The 5.1 surround sound track, which is available on any DVD player, puts you in the middle of the music, and gets rid of most of my objections to digital sound reproduction. The two channel high resolution track available only on a DVD-A player, gets rid of the rest of my objections to digital audio. An album with this much detail and beautiful music deserves to be listened to in this format. You will never listen to the CD again!
0440219078|5.0|When I was in the 7th grade our teacher read us this book. While browsing through Amazon I came across it. It was a wonderful book than, and now I have decided to buy the book. It is very unique and makes you think long, and hard. I would recommend this book to any and everyone.
B00006V9A0|5.0|There are no songs here that true Nirvana fans have not heard, including \\"You Know You're Right\\", which has been circulated as a bootleg for a few years now.  However, it is nice to get a high audio quality studio release of the supposed last Nirvana song ever recorded.  The bottom line though is this CD is packed with classic Nirvana songs and serves as a lasting reminder to how great this band was during its tragically short lifespan.  Great retrospective for existing fans and an intro for a new generation.  Personally, I cannot wait for the box set so I can get my hands on some rarities.  Until then this will have to do.  Five Stars

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has proven herself with her latest CD. It is so soulful and beautiful you have to ask yourself why she didnt do this with her first. <BR>Of course Dirrty is really upbeat and sexy, the perfect party song.<BR>My personal favorite is Cruz because it is the story of a girl leaving her home and how she's moving on. Almost made me cry the first time I heard it.<BR>Make over is a latin enthused, upbeat song. Another of my favorites.<BR>I went and bought this CD the first day it came out because I knew it was going to be awesome (and I wasnt dissapointed!)<BR>Every song is about being strong and most of all partying!<BR>Please do not hesitate to get this CD! It is so worth it! Christina has just proven how far she can go as an artist.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I have to be honest, this is the first Nirvana CD I have bought.  The reason being that at the height of Nirvana's career, I was just a teenager that didn't understand music.  Not since The Beatles has a band had such a profound affect on the music scene, and this CD PERFECTLY represents what Nirvana achieved.  This is one of the few CD's I have where every single track is awesome.  For those of you out there that regard music as a way of life, and not just a side note, this is an absolutely necessary CD to have in your collection.  You will not be disappointed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is a CD of pleasant surprise.  No polish - all soul.  This album is touted as \\"the real Christina.\\"  If this is true, I hope the real Christina never goes away again.  These are songs of raw emotion.  Christina co-wrote most of the songs on the album and as a writer she is brave and honest speaking for the young independent but somedays lost young woman of today.  It's always been apparent that her voice is incredible, but she finally gets a chance to try different styles.  The Latin \\"Infatuation\\" to the Motown-worthy \\"Impossible.\\"  (Anyone who can hold their own with the likes of Alicia Keys has passed Soul 101.)  Uplifting, fun and achingly honest her voice is amazing.  She has grown into an artist worth watching.
B00004ZD69|4.0|This blockbuster double album by Canadians Godspeed You Black Emperor is like something I've heard before. Yet it comes off as wholly original. All instrumental, it sounds like Glenn Branca guitar symphonies, Spiritualized and Sigur Ros. Yet it is so inventive it does not come off as pretentious as any of the latter. (Well, the album notes and diagram are pretty cryptic but still...I love it.) The mostly untitled songs seethe with building guitars, propulsive drums, strings, glockenspiel and more. A great introduction to GYBE.
B000000H66|5.0|I completed my album collection with Symbolic, and I hold it in very high regard. Chuck had one of the best minds in the metal world, and he wrote his songs as good as he played his guitar. <BR>RIP-Chuck
B000002JAX|5.0|I heard this at a friend's house and had to have it. I have listened to it over and over. I have bought copies for friends. This woman has a great voice and is able to go from blues to playful tunes to romantic ballads -- all equally well-done. She is superb. Does anyone know if she has made any other albums, and if not why not?
B000002WUD|5.0|This Album is a must for any one who considers himself an Elvis Fan. One Unique  aspect of Elvis&quot;s singing is the ability to put heart &amp; soul in to his performances. If you ever need any proof for this, then this is the box set that you need listen to. If there was a heart that bleeds , this is it. A truly great perfomance. One great thing about the King is that he left us a wide range of songs to match and suite any type of situation. This was one man who could interpret any song in anyway he wanted to. This Box set is ample proof for this. If you have a closer look at his 1970&quot;s chart performances , he has had 337 weeks on (with 16 Top Ten Hits) the british singles chart for 1970&quot;s alone. Now , Tom jones had 352 weeks for his entire career. Englebert had 235 for his whole career. Abba 380 weeks, Micheal Jackson 382 Weeks, Paul McCartney 397 weeks , John Lennon 181 weeks , Elton John 508 weeks.(all these stats are up to 1994). If you weigh Elvis's 70's chart placings with that of his contemperories , then you could see that Elvis has done remarkably well .Fiurther more, RIAA has awarded a gold certificate for this box set. I also beg fans not let Elvis's bad looks &amp; pill popping habits cloud your judgements when judging Elvis's voice , music &amp; performances. <br />Thanks &amp; best rgds
B00006LLNU|4.0|I reiterate Amazon's review of this album.  Tracks 6 and 8 are instantly likable but some of the others might take some getting used to.  This is certainly not an extension of Agaetis Byrjun, it is far less polished and lacking the full orchestra treatment.  Throughout most of the tracks I keep hearing \\"you sigh\\" over and over and over again (if your going to partially invent your own language to sing with like these guys wouldn't you add a little variety?).  Maybe I just don't \\"get\\" the motivation behind the repetition (some kind of artistic statement?) but I still appreciate the beauty of this remarkable music.
0385335482|4.0|It actually took me a while to finish this book because I was bored with it in the begining. I felt that the main character was irritating, stupid and boring. Finally when i got to the middle of the book it started getting a lot more interesting and I started actually feeling sorry for her. It has a great ending and i actually bought the next book in the series.
B00005JL78|1.0|A good idea poorly executed: Plain and Simple. As far as staying true to the spirit of Philip K. Dick's writings and themes, I won't criticize what isn't in the film, only what is.<br />In Minority Report Speilberg gives a few overt nods to another film about a future society that tries to eliminate crime, Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (the eye pieces, the drunk in the hallway) But this film has neither the impact or the depth of the Kubrick film. <br />Tom Cruise plays the same character he always does....Tom Cruise. The film suffers from many things; its too long, too much plot, lots of redundant dialogue, a camera that won't stay still when it should, predictable plotting. My BIGGEST gripe is that the script includes too many scenes of people explaining things: its excruciating. Janusz Kaminski proves again he is masterful with texture but has no idea how to frame a SINGLE memorable image. And we, of course, have the obligatory happy Spielberg ending. <br />I like long movies, I could watch Lawrence of Arabia and the Seven Samurai all day or ten hours of the Decalogue forever. When a movie is longer than two and a half hours I will be paying close attention. This movie was a waste of my time. <br />I should have walked out after the first hour, I could have found something else to do in that time that was more entertaining.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Quiet simply...the album is amazing. I purchased it before a long drive to grad school and it will forever remind me of my dark drive down the highway. There is just something that stays with me after I heard this album for the first time. It's hard to explain, but you'll feel it. The vocals, though free from actual words, allow listeners to create their own meaning--to make them their own (something that is encouraged by the blank pages of the CD booklet). And though I'd like to avoid the cliché, I can't--it reaches out and touches you.<br />Comprised of eight tracks, each of which is untitled, the album is divided into two separate parts. The first four are what I consider to be the \\"dawn\\" or \\"awakening\\". Their ethereal presence, soft vocals, and dream-like melodies are often so subtle they seem to evaporate into thin air. It is this ability to make memorable music that doesn't stand out which marks the return of ambient music to its rightful place. As Brian Eno first did, Sigur Ros now continues the task of creating music that is heard but not listened to. Quite simply, these first four tracks are the soundtrack for our thoughts when we're not thinking. <br />If the first half of the album is the innocence, the last represents the \\"dusk\\" or dark side of our conscious. Though subtle in part, this half of the album carries listeners to the edge of their thoughts with elaborate builds and then, suddenly, sets them free with crashing crescendos, pulsating drums, and guitar work that continues where Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" left off. Not to slight the other members of the band, but it is in this half of the album that Jónsi's haunting vocals truly shine. So angelic yet emotional, his voice, his \\"words\\" are universal. All races, religions, and cultures can be and will be touched by this man's outpouring of emotion. And such is the unique beauty of this album. Every bit as good as its predecessor Agaetis Byrjun, this album allows listeners to step out of reality, to step out of the box and into the ( ).
B000002GB9|1.0|I hate this album. I was somehow forced to listen to it almost EVERY DAMN DAY in high school. Somebody somewhere would have it on a portable cassette or 8-track in the halls or on the bus or in the quad. This was an album about conformity, not rock n' roll.<br />     Part of the problem is that Styx, obviously by the sound of Tommy Shaw & Dennis DeYoung's voices, really wanted to do opera, but they didn't have the discipline, nor did they have the wit of Queen to make opera rock out.<br />    Styx, like Journey & Loverboy, were one of those safe, squeaky clean prima donna kind of bands that the record companies foisted on the public in the '70's that took the place of real rock that had guts, sincerity, intelligence, passion, groove and/or soul and actually had something to do with yout life besides escapist silly crap about a sailing ship actually being an alien space ship (Come Sail Away is sooo cosmic dude...)<BR>or sophomoric bull of the \\"enlightenment\\" of figuring out it's all \\"A Grand Illusion\\" (wow, no ...? Welcome to the real world Tommy & Dennis!) and \\"deep inside we're all the same\\" which is true, but OUTWARDLY we WEREN'T, especially when THEY were making millions selling this garbage and the rest of us were suffering violations of our civil rights & facing a limited future.<br />    Amazingly Styx & others like them did this con job all before Lou Pearlman came up with the idea of boy bands (same thing, only at least Styx played their own instruments, I'll give them that).<br />    Styx sucks, and I consider all your negative votes an honor.<BR>This band, along with Kansas, Journey, Loverboy, and all other pseudo art rock bands should never have existed. <br />   \\"Miss America\\" was their ONLY good song.

B000002I6T|5.0|This is a great album and anyone who likes CSN should buy it.  The album flows well from start to finish the tracks are good alone but as one grand piece of music it really shines.  The harmonies are great and the way voices and instruments merge into a hazy blur.  A good album to chill to and worth getting so you can have fun trying to &quot;spot&quot; the famous guests on it(don't look at the inlay first!).

I dont know why everyone thinks this is there best.... battery is a good song with a niiice intro... master of puppets is the best song on the cd i think ...orion is probabaly the best instrumental ive heard. The rest of the cd isnt worth mentioning because i usually skip them.
B0000640VO|2.0|See, I'm a French guy, I live in Paris and I know quite well about the area where this movie was shot. It's a poor, dirty area, with plenty of bums and rats, it's not at all like it is showed in the film. So don't get abused. This movie is just a postcard on celluloid, this is valuable only for the tourists.<br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who before this \\"Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain\\" (the French title), had directed some pretty 'noir' and sordid movies like \\"Delicatessen\\", \\"The City of the lost Children\\" and \\"Alien 4\\", completely changed his vision for this film; he even changed his director of photography! For a single young girl, for her big eyes and her haircut in the Louise Brooks style only, he cleaned up the 18th district of Paris. Here, no rain, no bad weather, no clouds in the sky, no traffic jam, no pollution, no garbage bins, no dirt on the sidewalks, in the gutters and in railway and metro stations... which may be acceptable. But when he puts away all the poor elements - the Black and Arabian people, and the bums -, and gives to Jamel Debbouze (an Arabian comic, very well-known in France) a character with a typical French name - Lucien -, then we have the right to scream with fury and ask for the filmmaker to be on court martial. Maybe it's only a movie, and you can tell me this, but I think there's still some respect to be shown for the location and the people.<br />But this is not the most disgusting look of the film. No, what can easily make you throw up is the emptiness of the treatment, there's no message at all, the story is ridiculous and unsignificant, and Amelie and Nino excepted, the characters don't evoluate, don't progress, they just keep turning around and around in closed spaces they practically never get out from. Amelie herself is quite irritating, she's not very intelligent, doesn't have any of the grace that all the medias gave her, and her stupid games and her way of minding the others' business are desperating. How can you be interestedin such a character? The special effects are honeyed and add to the boring and too long aspect of the film, where nothing happens from the beginning to the ending. This movie, which received five Academy Award nominations, would have deserved the one for sugar. Mathieu Kassovitz, a shocker director, disappoints his fans with this sweethearted character, a little lost. Dominique Pinon (\\"The City of the lost Children\\", \\"Alien 4\\") and Isabelle Nanty are very good, so is the ending, but it's not enough.<br />The reasons of the success of this film are that it tells a fairy-tale in a real place, and portrays an ideal world, where everything is white, clean and neat, and in the end everything is always OK. We may be skeptical about this... In any case this movie is the proof that we can make any ... believable with a good dose of 'Chantilly' cream, when we see how successful and highrated it is...
B00002MZ12|5.0|Ignore the &quot;professional&quot; reviewers who think that they know good music when they hear it. Those who say that this album is anything but superb have incorrectly labeled the music.<BR>   It is true that all but three of the songs on this album are off of her other two national-release albums. That is of no point, though, because they come back to life with new emotions, once again thought over, and with totally different music, for the most part.<BR>   The harsh songs &quot;Joining You&quot;, &quot;Ironic&quot;, and &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; transform completely into sorrowful ballads of human life, seeming almost seperate from their studio counterparts.<BR>   The only miniscule thing that I found to be upsetting was that Alanis would sing some songs (&quot;I Was Hoping&quot; and &quot;These R the Thoughts&quot;, for example) with a slow rhythm until nearing the very end, where thay basically send a flood of instrumentals and suddenly stop.<BR>   But, all in all, you will never know Alanis until you hear her perform live, and this is one of the best places to find her in that state.
B000002B30|3.0|...there are too many hits missing, and the sound quality isn't always so good (the early tracks have not been remastered). It would be great if Columbia Records made &quot;The Essential Bruce Springsteen&quot; as a doubleCD set, featuring all the missing tracks (&quot;I'm on fire&quot;, &quot;Nebraska&quot;, &quot;Darkness on the edge of town&quot;, &quot;Jungleland&quot; etc.) plus &quot;The ghost of Tom Joad&quot;, &quot;I wanna be with you&quot;, &quot;Sad eyes&quot; and something from &quot;The Rising&quot;.

B00006V9A0|5.0|I've got all of Nirvana's cds and I love them all, especially In Utero.  I was really young when Kurt died, but I have always loved Nirvana.  So I picked up their new cd and figured \\"oh well at least there's a new song\\".  The remix of Pennyroyal Tea isn't half bad.  I really enjoyed it, but the real reason I picked this up was for \\"You Know You're Right\\".  This song is the final Nirvana song written and recorded and it's a great one.  Check this out if you're a fan or if you like one of their radio songs, cuz it's probably on here.

B00006CXXU|2.0|Let's ignore Christina's painfully contrived image switch up and focus on what really matters when you're buying an album; how good or bad it sounds. First, a word of warning: if you are planning on buying \\"Stripped\\" because you enjoy her first single \\"Dirrty\\" think again. 75% of the songs are Celine Dion-esque syrupy ballads about how under-appreciated she is and how much love blows. If we set aside the few profanities and rappers, \\"Stripped\\" is an album I can picture my 55 year old mother completely loving. While it's not all overwrote balladry, there are two extremely horrid rock songs (\\"Fighter\\" and the borderline rip-off of the UK's Sugababes \\"Overload,\\" \\"Make Up\\") and R+B grinders (Can't Hold Us Down featuring Lil Kim, who's sounds so impassionate and bored on this \\"girl power anthem\\" that I wouldn't be knocked over if I heard she did it on one take, lying in bed with a killer hang over). I can't help but wonder where all the potential singles are. There is nothing even mildly resembling the undeniable catchiness of \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" on this album. Better whip out your musical black book Christina because you are gonna need some remixes ASAP. Though, the biggest sin on \\"Stripped,\\" besides the completely laughable album inlay photography, is how  - despite having a team of producers - it runs together like a drawn-out obnoxious screamfest. Instead of using her vocals to illustrate some sort of emotional build up in her ballads she just wails from beginning to end, which completely depreciates her voice by the end of the album. Come to think of it, after listening to \\"Stripped\\" I couldn't help but ponder where all the controversy is hiding. Sure, I heard a couple cusses but I was really expecting a no-holds-barred, \\"Erotica\\" calibre songs. What we get instead is weak Mary J Blige takes, mixed with a little Foxy Brown circa \\"Broken Silence\\" personal confessions that, unlike the aforementioned rapstress, come off completely forced and phoney. <br />Good thing Christina is creating hype with her new image and \\"Girls Gone Wild meets Mad Max\\" video because \\"Stripped\\" is a bewilderingly play-it-safe album that won't find any itself.
6305897786|5.0|This movie requires a bit of thought. I myself collect rare volumes on the occult so it made more sense to me. One must appreciate the inticate puzzle involved in opening the nine gates and acheiving godlike stature. I found it to be a satisfying mystery that begged to be solved. You could truly understand everyone's obsession with obtaining this book. Equally understanible is Frank Langella's Borris Balkan and his final fatal decision to show his supposed new found powers. One must accept that our hero here, played to perfection by the ever adaptable Johnny Depp, is not perfect. He has been tempted and ultimately succumbed to the lure of unlimited power. The ending was difficult to grasp for a lot of viewers, but it is really simple. Corso and his guardian angel unlocked the ninth gate. This is not your typical slasher movie. If you want a good mystery that you can sink your teeth into, sit back and enjoy!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Being a huge fan of Christina Aguilera's,...The explicit \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine cover, the raunchy \\"Dirrty\\" video (being banned in Thailand, no less), her VMA outfit amongst other stunts has contributed to the public becoming more aware of Ms. Aguilera's celebrity..now whether thats a good or bad thing is open for debate. But bad publicity is still publicity nonetheless. However, what I'm afraid of is that in the ensuing scandal and criticism over Christina's naughty girl antics, \\"Stripped\\" will either get overlooked or even completely ignored. This CD is simply put the best CD from a solo female artist this year, Christina was smart to take her time and really delve into her artistry for her official followup to her worldwide smash debut \\"Christina Aguilera\\". STRIPPED covers a wide range of musical styles, shifting from rock (Fighter & Make Over), latin pop (Infatuation), soulful ballads (Walk Away & Loving Me 4 Me), bluesy R&B (Alicia Key's collaboration Impossible), hip-hop pop (Dirrty & Can't Hold Us Down) and even gospel/inspirational pop (Soar & The Voice Within) and Xtina even takes on the power rock ballad (in the form of the riveting Cruz). And the blend is pure genius, Christina Aguilera has the voice of an angel and she has more than proven that she can sing ANY type of music and do it with passion and intensity. The limited chart success of \\"Dirrty\\" can be contributed to a lot of things even though it does seem strange that a performer who had 4 #1 songs out of the last 5 single releases can't even crack the top 40. STRIPPED will endure I believe, because it is simply a wonderful album and Christina sings her heart out and doesn't go over the top with vocal histronics, something she's been guilty of on rare occasions in the past. With silky instrumentation, unique vocal arrangements as well as powerful and thought provoking lyrics, STRIPPED is good for the soul as well as the mind. Surefire hit songs, awaiting a chance to explode on radio and the charts are the heartfelt \\"Beautiful\\" which explores self-worth and others power to influence the way one feels about themselves, sounding like a cross between Alanis Morrissette and the Beatles, this song could possibly be Christina's biggest hit since \\"Genie In A Bottle\\". \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" also springs to mind as single potential with its sing along chorus and striking melody & lyrics, Ms Aguilera is giving 'em what they want. Also the Alicia Keys collaboration \\"Impossible\\" is a wonderful, soulful, bluesy ballad that only gets better with repeated listens. Christina Aguilera has certainly delivered and even though her image is now getting more attention than her music, with 1 listen to STRIPPED, its crystal clear that Aguilera is a talented singer-songwriter/budding producer and her talent will not be ignored. Christina, to quote from an old 80's hit, \\"you don't have to take your clothes off to have a good time\\", STRIPPED provides all the thrills and excitement any fan needs.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina, girl, you have truly done it. This album is an ecclectic blend of creativity and true singing. \\"Stripped\\" goes out on a limb with its mix of rhythms and melodies, and manages to become one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. Some of the best gems (and there are many) are \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Impossible,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Underappreciated,\\" and \\"The Voice Within.\\" Honestly, I love every single song. Christina has to be lauded for not resting on her popularity and taking chances. It's a step I'm sure she'll be rewarded for. Buy this CD!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|She's back, and better than ever! This album proves that Christina has the pipes - and knows how to use them! Yes, she's changed. Yes, &quot;Dirrty&quot; is a little - different, shall we say. But that's only one song on the record, don't jump to conclusions. She's not afraid to show who she is; be true to herself. She flexes her pipes on all sorts of levels, from the anthems &quot;Can't Hold Us Down,&quot; and &quot;Fighter&quot; to the bluesy &quot;Impossible&quot; to the stunning ballad &quot;Beautiful.&quot; And she lays her past out on the table on &quot;I'm OK.&quot; All of the songs on the record have they own special quality to them - they are all amazing in their own unique way. Christina's put her foot down and said, 'This is me - take it or leave it' And no matter what anyone says, she gonna &quot;Keep On Singin' (Her) Song.&quot;
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I have been an Iron Maiden fan for as far as I can remember, and I've heard all of their albums thousands of times.  Until this album was released, I'd have to say that my favorite Maiden studio album was either Powerslave or Number of the Beast.  In my opinion, this album surpasses them both!  The music is not only sophisticated and mature, but it is also powerful.  The three guitar lineup is absolutely amazing as is Bruce's vocals, Nicko's drumming, and Steve's bass.  Similarly, the lyrics are thought out and well-written. I highly recommend Brave New World.  It is, in my opinion, a \\"must have\\" not only for Iron Maiden fans, but also for any fan of excellent, heavy music.  To all of those people who said that Iron Maiden was finished after 7th Son of a 7th Son... listen to this!!!!!

His complex characters and unexpected plot twists make for the kind of reading in which you look at your watch, see that it is 4 am and realize you have to go to work in a couple of hours. If you like books that are unpredictable, beautifully written and leave you saying &quot;I cant wait for the next one&quot; I highly recomend every book in this series
B00000JPHF|5.0|Basically \\"Frankenstein: The Legacy Collection\\" deserves five stars on the basis of Disc One alone. There you have both of the classic Universal films directed by James Whale, \\"Frankenstein\\" (1931) and \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" (1935), available on DVD for the first time. You also have the trailers for each film, a original poster and photo gallery for \\"The Bride of Frankenstein\\" (the one for \\"Frankenstein\\" is on Side Two of Disc Two) and audio commentaries by film historians, with Rudy Behlmer speaking on the original and Scott MacQueen having the honors on the sequel. Then, in the \\"oh by the way\\" category, we have the fact that in these two films Boris Karloff turns in the greatest performance as a monster in movie history (also one of the most moving). Karloff thought it was a mistake to have the monster speak in the sequel, but he was wrong and when you watch these two classic movies again, with their remastered audio tracks, you will know why.<br /><br />I used to show both of these films in literature classes where my students read Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" and then had to write a paper evaluating how the movies changed, added or deleted key elements when compared to the orignal novel. Given that today more people know about the movies than the original novel, such distinctions are worthy recognizing. For Shelley the sin of Frankenstein (the doctor and not the monster) was not in bringing his creation to life but rather in abandoning it afterwards. However, the Universal movies always have Dr. Frankenstein, his son, or his surrogate, firmly in the Mad Scientist role. At that point we are talking about the fact that there are some things man is not meant to tamper with, an idea that we can trace back to the unsinkable \\"Titanic\\" and then all the way back to the Tower of Babel. So the Frankenstein legacy established by the two films Whales and Karloff made are of cultural significance.<br /><br />Although I am in the camp that maintains \\"Bride\\" is the better of the two and the best Frankenstein movie ever made, the original is a close second and both are absolute classics. Each movie by itself is a five. Put both on the same DVD and it is a five-plus. Throw in the commentary tracks and it is a five-plus-plus. But in \\"The Legacy Collection\\" it seems \\"Bride\\" is but the first of four \\"bonus\\" movies. Side One of Disc Two offers up \\"The Son of Frankenstein\\" (1939) with its theatrical trailer and \\"The Ghost of Frankenstein\\" (1942). Side Two has \\"House of Frankenstein\\" (1944) and its trailer, Stephen Sommers the director of \\"Van Helsing\\" discussing on \\"Universal's Classic Monster: Frankenstein's Monster,\\" \\"She's Alive! Creating the Bride of Frankenstein,\\" \\"The Frankenstein Files: How Hollywood Made a Monster,\\" the aforementioned original poster and photo gallery for \\"Frankenstein,\\" and, a short film entitled \\"Boo!\\" (which makes more use of W.F. Muranau's \\"Nosferatu\\" than it does the Universal Frankenstein movies, so go figure why it is not part of \\"Dracula: The Legacy Collection\\"). Rather than commenting on each film individually just allow me to say that for ratings I would go with \\"Frankenstein\\" at 4.5 rounded up, \\"Bride\\" at a solid 5.0, \\"Son\\" at 4.0, \\"Ghost\\" at 3.5 rounded down, and \\"House\\" at 3.5 rounded up.<br /><br />Boris Karloff is still playing the monster in the third one, and then Lon Chaney, Jr. plays the monster in the fourth one (but with Bela Lugosi's voice at the end). Then in the fifth one Karloff is back, but as the mad scientist this time around. Chaney is back too, but as the Wolf Man, and Glen Strange plays the monster. Actually \\"House\\" is the sixth film, with \\"Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,\\" which has Lugosi as the monster and Chaney as the Wolf Man the fifth in the series (you will find it in the Wolf Man Legacy Collection).  You have to be familiar with it to know why the monster and Lawrence Talbot are found together.  Technically,  \\"House of Dracula\\" is the last of the Universal Frankenstein films, but it in the Dracula Legacy Collection, thereby proving that Frankenstein is the greatest movie monster of them all.  All of that is more than enough to justify having Boris Karloff's name above \\"FRANKENSTEIN\\" on the cover, with a photograph of him in Jack Pierce's famous makeup from the first film (you can tell because he does not have one of those metal bands on the top right side of his head) in a nice shade of dark green. The packaging for this series is great because the DVD folder goes in a slipcase with a plastic cutaway that has a flash of lightning over Castle Frankenstein to add to the effect. The presentation is the same for the Dracula, Wolf Man, Mummy, Invisible Man, and Creature from the Black Lagoon Legacy Collections, but the Frankenstein set is the best of the bunch.Legacy Collection, thereby proving that Frankenstein is the greatest movie monster of them all.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I wasn't originally looking forward to this album.  I wasn't a fan of Christina's first album.  Fortunately I got the chance to listen to Stripped before its realease.  This is a great album.  All of the songs are good.  Don't judge the album based on the first single \\"Dirrty.\\"  The rest of the album isn't really like that song.  Christina gets a chance to use her voice on something besides teen-pop garbage on this album.  I recommend it.

0671027344|3.0|I gave, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a rating of three stars.  For me, the story line was not captivating.  However, my curiousity reguarding the characters and how they handled the problems they encountered, would bring me back to the book.  This book was composed of a series of letters written by the main character, Charlie, to a person who remained completely anonymous .  The letters reflected Charlie's feelings during different situations he was faced with.  Throughout the course of Charlie's freshman year in high school, he deals with problems such as suicide, drugs and alcohol, 1st crush, teenage pregnancy, sexual abuse, problems with life at home, and personal insecurities, such as fitting in at school and feeling accepted.  The characters in this book are really easy to identify with because they deal with problems almost every teenager can relate to during some point in their high school career.  I would recommend this book to teenagers because I think they would be able to appreciate it the most and would most likely find it comforting to know that they are not alone in the problems they face.

The emphasis, of course, is on the first two albums which comprise a total of 15 tracks:  six from &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; and all but two from &quot;Rumours.&quot;<br />As a bonus, disc 1 includes a five-minute video on the making of their new album to be released in the spring of 2003, along with a selected discography, song lyrics and additional web links.  All told, this is an excellent overview of one of the most successful bands of the seventies.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000000OQF|4.0|From the beginning of Welcome to the Jungle to the end of Rocket Queen you'll be hooked to this cd. Welcome to the Jungle and Out Ta Get Me are rock at it's purest. Paradise City demonstrates some catchy lyrics and a great tune. Sweet Child O' Mine, their first hit, seems a little softer and is clean lyrically and yet still great rock and roll especially with the guitar solo towards the end. VH1 named GNR #9 on the best hard rock bands of all time on a recent show and although Use Your Illusion I and II both show more versatility, they have too much filler, and this is the best overall album. Definately a good buy, every rock fan should have this in their CD collection. Top Songs: Paradise City, Sweet Child O' Mine, Welcome to the Jungle
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I cry about twice a year on average, and I cried through most of this film.<br />From the hard first scene to the despairing end, this movie is the most depressing and one of the best movies I have ever seen.<br />The film focuses on two inter-related stories involving four main characters and follows them from their initial hopes and dreams to the horrible, despairing end that awaits all four of them.<br />One of the characters, Mrs. Goldfarb, eventually becomes insane through her use of diet pills which stemmed from her obsession with appearing fit and trim on a tv show.  Her son, Harry, in an attempt to go somewhere with his and his girlfiend's life, gets the not-so-brilliant idea of becoming a drug-dealer, and his friend Tyrone also helps out in this scheme.<br />Harry's girlfriend, Marion, is an addict and when Harry can't provide drugs for her, she turns to prostitution.  Harry and Tyrone both end up in nightmarish ends, but Marion's end is far worse.<br />The music is amazing and the cinematography is stunning as the movie grabs you and brutally forces you into this nightmarish plunge.<br />Caution though, if you are planning to watch the director's cut, watch out for the graphic group and lesbian sex scene.  It caught me off guard, but the scene is necessary to grasp just how far Marion had fallen and just how horrible it is what she is doing to herself.<br />This is a very disturbing and depressing movie, but it is also very powerful and will change the way you view addicts and prostitutes.  It will impact you.
0953104907|5.0|This book has been my essential reference while building my first solid body electric guitar. Melvyn has written a very comprehensive and practical guide to all stages of construction from the basics of designing your own instrument through to applying the finishing touches. <BR>I like the way Melvyn discusses a variety of approaches for each task in design and building. You are encouraged to understand and think creatively rather than follow a strict plan. If that sounds a bit fuzzy, and the lack of detailed plans puts you off (there are none in this book) I can try to reassure that all you need is here. Despite having next to no woodworking experience myself I'm now most of the way through my first instrument and already planning the next couple. It also gave me the confidence to front up to a local luthiery (Gilet Guitars in Sydney, Australia), choose my materials and ask some reasonably intelligent questions.<BR>One really nice aspect of the book is that Melvyn shares anecdotes about his own mistakes over the years so that you can anticipate problems - or at least not feel too bad when you make a few mistakes of your own along the way.<BR>So, in summary - buy this book and be inspired.
B00005OWEH|3.0|I expected more from this movie. It tends to be slow and without any major surprise or twist. There are no conflicts that really standout. The combat scenes seems to be staged and locking depth. Overall: FAIR.
B00006V9A0|1.0|One more way to make a profit, based around a few people who are greedy for money or cannot agree over who has the copyrights to produce and distribute a dead man's work, this is.  <br />One new song... it should have been a single.  You know [I'm] right.  Go buy import albums.  You can get tons of unreleased songs that way, which should be exactly what this album is about; new music experience and a way to preserve the art.  Nirvana does not need hype (watch that movie).  OUTSCESTICIDE I, II, and III, the eight-disc box set the Heart Shaped Box, and the PAY TO PLAY album, are all gods in comparison.  They have the old songs like this one, but they offer a wide variety of \\"never before heard\\" tracks.  <br />One hundred years from now, when Nirvana is a historic monument, this disc will only show that money is what made it, and much of \\"art\\" today, tick.  In that time the copyrights will be gone due to incorporation into common culture (life + 75 years is what copyright is if I am not mistaken).  The man is dead and the only thing keeping these songs from us is money.  <br />There is more that one way to go, and I am not supporting or condoning the breaking of laws.  But I do believe in what is right; this disc is not.  But remember Thoreau, \\"If... the machine of government... is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law.\\"  A dead man's life's work cannot live behind hidden dollar signs.  Do not act dumb along side the cries of artistic freedom and support this.  <br />...The DUMB album is good too, for a few songs.  And one track that's great that's not on any of those that should be online is \\"clean up before she comes,\\" not to be confused with \\"here she comes now\\" (which is also great).
B00005V1Y0|5.0|When i first saw this title i expected to see Fred and Ginger glide across the floor too those fantasic Berlin or Gershwin tunes or it was about a guy with really tight underwear.Boy,was i wrong,a family picture,no explosions,no murders or beatings,you can watch with your kids without having to explain embarrassing bedroom scenes or language.Barry Fife(not Barney)is a shady dance promoter who gets his nose punched(that's the limit of the violence).Good acting,first class directing,good story line.The dance numbers are not as smooth as a big musical,but it would spoil the picture if they were,this is not Hollywood,it's Austrailia.All's well that ends well,everyone even the audience get on the floor and with big happy smiles and dance to a bouncy tune.If you want a family movie this is for you,you'l not be dissapointed.This is my second gem,the first was Sunset,i'l be looking for more.
B00006V9A0|4.0|What else is there to say? For all the Nirvana fans...All their greatest songs with the previously unreleased \\"You know you're right\\". Good songs from a band that is now part of rock history. The only bad thing I can say about this is that record companies are basically coming out with this cd for marketing purposes only: all these songs (but one) can be found on the other Nirvana cd's the fans own anyway. Buy this if you don't have a cd burner is the basic message, or if you would die of knowing your Nirvana cd collection isn't complete yet.
B00006V9A0|4.0|'You Know You're Right' -Very powerful. Much better quality than on the radio or and MP3. Everything is crisp & clear (as with all the tracks,) but the fact that it's at the beginning of the record bugs me since all the rest are in order by date.<br />'About A Girl' -Wow! They really did a number on this one; everything sounds wonderful! One of many tracks that greatly needed remastering! <br />'Been A Son' -This version of 'Been A Son' is from the band's BLEW EP, which features great differences from that of INCESTICIDE (this version also includes a great bass solo by Krist!)<br />'Sliver' -Very average remastering, but I couldn't ignore all the digital fuzz at the begining because of it.<br />'Smells Like Teen Spirit' -Very, very good. The bass sounds much clearer, and the drums are just great! A little to much compression, though...<br />'Come As You Are' -Great remastering... The guitar solo really comes alive!<br />'Lithium' -Awesome. Dave's doorknock bass drum beat & jazzy cymbal work really stand out. It all sounds alive!<br />'In Bloom' -One of the tracks that greatly benefitted from remastering. Kurt's guitar is just...words can't explain! Dave's drums have more of a kick, and Krist's bass sounds really clean.<br />'Heart Shaped Box' -In my opinion, the best remastering on this album is on this track. Backing vocals, acoustic guitar, bass...it all just sounds so much cleaner and better sounding than on IN UTERO.<br />'Pennyroyal Tea' -This is the Scott Litt remixed version. Great remastering, but I still prefer the original version...well, kinda.<br />'Rape Me' -Very good remastering. <br />'Dumb' -See 'Heart Shaped Box.'<br />'All Apologies' -This version is from MTV's Unplugged. Sounds very warm. Absolutely great remastering done on this track.<br />'The Man Who Sold The World' -Great. No, fabulous! It is also from Unplugged. Bass sounds great, and the remastering makes it sound even better than it already is! What a great cover of David Bowie!<br />Wellthere you have it. All the tracks sound breathtaking (with a few exceptions,) and overall I think it's a good album to pick up!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Though I'm a Tom Hanks fan, I didn't see this movie in theatres nor did I rent it.  Reason?  The story sounded boring as all get out and the 2.5 hrs interminable.  However,  I very recently stumbled on it via satellite because I was bored.  But what a great movie to &quot;un-bore&quot; oneself with!  I was immediately rivetted, no doubt due to Hanks' perfect acting skills that could only bring such an otherwise difficult role to sink into come to life.  In fact, I so enjoyed this flick I decided it was DVD-able, that is, it belongs in my DVD collection.  So I bought it.  Despite the 2.5 hr. length and the premise that it's really a one-man show, the movie moves along, a hard task for any filmmaker and certainly, for the main (and only real) character in the story.
B00002MZ12|2.0|This album shouldnt be made by alanis . Alanis is not as mature as Eric Clapton. This album proves this. Her flute performance was totally a tragedy. And all the impression I have is her bare foot.
B000066F6H|3.0|at first, i was, like, what??? but now, it's pretty cool, y'know? swedish punk? OK, I guess so. awfully abrasive, but that's fun. it's kinda crazy and fun to play driving out of the parking garage on friday especially when your co-workers or even the people who work for you hear it and are like what? no way he listens to that! better than the strokes, for sure. and it's actual punk, unlike every band any 14 year old calls punk, which is like a billion bands nowadays. guerre nuclair!
B000002MY3|5.0|This is the style of alanis. You will find coarse thing, romantic thing, powerful thing. Someone like it because of its wonderful melody , someone dislike it because of its powerful sound and lyrics, I like them all cause they are combined so well you cant seperate them
B000002LBH|5.0|for years I only had best of the smiths vol. 1, figuring that had all their best songs. wrong! so much great stuff on this one, even with some duplication from best 1. totally worth every penny. &quot;you just haven't earned it yet baby&quot; and &quot;sweet and tender hooligan&quot; and many more. song for song, better than best 1. be cool--buy it.<br />and if you've read &quot;the perks of being a wallflower&quot; (and you should have) this has &quot;asleep,&quot; the song the kid is always talking about. brilliant!
B000002MY3|5.0|This album is so great. I heard &quot;Ironic&quot; several years back. I couldnt understand how she could combine romance with power so wonderful. And I got this album. Definitely unpriced. Every song can stand your consistent listening. Romantic . but not soft.
B00005QIPH|3.0|if this is the phoenix-like return of rock, I can only wonder why. the first two songs are excellent, especially the lou-reed rip-off second song (they've got him down pat), but after that it's decent rock with annoyingly fuzzy vocals. Granted the dude doesn't have a great voice, but fuzzing it to the point of pain just makes it worse. not bad, but not great either. how ironic is the title?
B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album is almost-unmarred sonic beauty. From the incredible chord progression on &quot;Candy Says&quot; to the unlikely &quot;After Hours&quot;, this album deserves a place in the collection of any 60's and 70's rock fan.  The only obvious sour note in the album is &quot;Jesus&quot;, a strange song that doesn't quite seem fitting with the rest of the album.  &quot;What Goes On&quot; is an excellent song, and &quot;After Hours&quot; is one of my favorites (in spite of the almost joking nature of the song).  A must-have.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is a great collection of songs.  Now, I am not a hugh fan of Elvis, but I do enjoy and recognise the talent he posesed as a singer, as well as his contributions to pop culture. He did create a large body of work which is best represented here in these 30 #1 hits. All his greats are here from &quot;Heartbreak Hotel,&quot; to &quot;In the Ghetto.&quot;  Anyone who was and is a diehard fan they probably already have these songs, but anyone who is not a diehard fan this is a fine album to add to your record collection.
B00006F83Y|1.0|Just because \\"Rock is back,\\" as Rolling Stone so eloquently put it, doesn't mean it was ever gone.  Unfortunately, sellouts like Rolling Stone did more to hinder rather than help...corporate radio by letting half-naked non-songwriters who can't play instruments grace its cover so often in the past five years or so.  So where was rock?  On your local college campus, doing small tours of the UK, on those new-release cd's at Best Buy that you've never heard of because they're not played on ... corporate radio or reviewed by Rolling Stone.  You just had to know where to look to find any kind of new sound.  So imagine my surprise to find the ear-friendly Queens of the Stone Age on...corporate radio!  I was so happy, I ran out and bought the album...  Oh, what a letdown!  That radio song is the only one that sounds anything like it.  Every other song is forgettable pulp.  Hard rock, yes.  Good hard rock, no.  It just made me wish I was listening to Nevermind.  What we need is, in fact, a new Nirvana, a new Radiohead, or a new U2; and Queens of the Stone Age just isn't it.  When you go out to buy the Queens' album, buy the Hives instead, and go home and download the Queens' radio hit.  Show...corporate labels that you won't spend eighteen dollars for a single good song.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Before moving on, let's get one thing straight: Christina has a great voice. And thank goodness, she finally learned how to use it.<br />Unfortunatly, she seems confused as to which direction she wants her music to take. Don't judge the album by &quot;Dirrty,&quot; it's easily the weakest song on the album.<br />Don't get me wrong, though. Among the changing genres are some real &quot;stand-out&quot; tracks. The best songs on the album, in my personal opinion, are: Beautiful, I'm Ok, Impossible, and Underappreciated. Remember the Olympics? Christina performed &quot;Infatuation,&quot; which, again, misrepresented the album. But, more than half a year later, it's still catchy as heck.<br />By itself, this album would rate three stars. But, if you take into consideration Christina's amazing voice, and the improvement from her last album (&quot;Christina Aguilera&quot; was a real stinker of a CD), it easily bumps it into 4-star territory.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Greatest Rock Band on Earth? They're up there, Nirvana is one of the most powerful and relentlessly moving groups ever. You Know You're Right is the perfect capstone to this album, which never fails to be moving or just downright cool, here's a track listing, which has failed to be on this site yet:<br />1. You Know You're Right<BR>2. About A Girl<BR>3. Been A Son<BR>4. Sliver<BR>5. Smells Like Teen Spirit<BR>6. Come As You Are<BR>7. Lithium<BR> 8. In Bloom<BR>9. Heart-Shaped Box<BR>10. Pennyroyal Tea<BR>11. Rape Me<BR>12. Dumb<BR>13. All Apologies<BR>14. The Man Who Sold The World<br />From the downright ferocity of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' to the sheer brilliance of 'Lithium' to the superb beats of 'Heart Shaped Box' and the overall feel of 'You Know You're Right' This album could be described in countless ways, but all i can really say is buy it, and have a piece of history in your house. Kurt Cobain is one of the greatest rock icons of all time, and this proves his suffering wasn't for naught. He brought us into a new realm of audio experience. Not to mention this CD kicks.... Nirvana was more than just rock/grunge/whatever you want to call it, it was a revelation.  Another spectacular aspect of this disc is that after the opening track, the songs progress in chronological order, so you can literally listen to the band evolve from 'Bleach' to their final appearance on 'MTV Unplugged'.  That is an experiance in itself.  Get this CD, trust me, it's one of the best of the year.  My only qualm about this cd is that it could have used more tracks.. 'On a Plain' and 'Territorial Pissings' come to mind as worthy additions, but those songs would throw the cd off track.  Adding a few sharp curves (Territorial Pissings is a pretty hard song, but still awesome) to a perfectly fine roller coaster could cause it to go off the rails.  Fourtunatley, this CD will stay right on track as it rolls its' way into your CD player, and trust me, it will stay there (and in mine) for aVERY long time.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Barry Lyndon is a great movie, who would doubt it? Sets, Light, costumes, etc.etc. are unbelievably accurate (not as some of the music (i.e. Schubert): a landmark in historical reconstruction in film-history.<BR>If some reviewers find the film boring, dull, wooden etc., then this critic doesn't really blame Kubrick but Thackeray - read the brilliant novel \\"Barry Lyndon\\" (1853) by this author, and you will appreciate the movie even more. 19th-century-irony, its bitterly smiling look and distanced glance at the \\"galant\\" 18th century makes part of the film too, for that, screaming for \\"more authencity\\" or more \\"action\\" are directed against the most interior concept, the heart of the film - this film takes history as a past created by posterity, a mix of citations, parody, nostalgy, exotism, bewildering otherness. <BR>See and enjoy: the more you research about the background of this film, the more you will admire Kubricks art.
B00006CXXU|5.0|The best album I've heard.. I was totally shocked and amazed. Christina is the best singer/preformer of all time.. BUT IT NOW! GO! RUN, NOW! If I had to choose between food (my life) & this CD I would pick 'Stripped'.. :)
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is by far the album of the year.  Christina Aguilera displays an abundance of courage, wisdom and sheer TALENT on this record.  From her soulful Walk Away, to the rock anthem Make Over, she exploits every aspect of the musical world and plays them with her fingertips.  Not an ounce of fear to discuss her difficult childhood on the track I'm OK and oozing pure \\"gusto\\" in response to harsh media criticism, her transition from a pop princess to the new and improved (or should I say the REAL) respectable musician is purely flawless.  The lyrics leave nothing wanting, her voice is as powerful as ever (used now in a way that makes the SONG special, not her range), and the accompanying tracks make for a pristine recording all the way through. From start to finish, each word, note and beat of this album is dripping with Aguilera's true sentiments.  While one may struggle to \\"know\\" the former POP diva, this album may help them to at least \\"understand\\" her.  A refreshingly REAL album.  Very different from her debut release, but a MUST HEAR in any respect.  She may lose some of her \\"Genie\\" fans but will gain a ton more who can do no less than respect her courage, strength and her talents as an artist.  No longer just a \\"voice\\", Aguilera shines through on this record as a force to be reckoned with...on and off the Billboard charts.  You go Christina...
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is probally one of the best films that i've seen of 2001 it directed Beautifully and just everyone in it iz amazing. specially Jenna malone (gretchen) Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko) and there are good perfomences by Patrcik swayze and Drew Barrymore . I deffinetly give it Two thumbs Way up and 10 starz
B00006HBUB|1.0|There are 2 types of SD Fans in the world.  One which loved this movie, one that loathed this movie.  SD fans will be quick to pick up on the \\"homage/tribute\\" (what the director likes to call it), which brings forward  the idea that this is a \\"great\\" movie for SD fans.  Wrong.  The \\"homage/tribute\\" is washed away so quickly from the mind, as you are constantly questioning when would Shaggy and Scooby compete in a farting contest, or when velma would be dancing in a womens shower room dressed a bikini (A scene cut from the movie, as it was deemed inapropiate for a pg rating).<br />As a stand-alone movie, this is one to avoid.  As a movie for fan purposes, this varies depending upon how long you have grown up with scooby-doo, or if you can ever imagine your favorite saturday morning cartoon revamped, and forced to sell drug/sex humor to audinces

0804115613|5.0|I loved reading this book.  It was hard for me to put it down on most nights.  I would get lost in the streets of Whistle Stop or loose track of time in the caf.  Fannie Flagg's characters seemed real to me and I often found myself referring to them like I would to my good friends.  Not only was it a good story, but it was also a good lesson.  Mrs. Threadgoode helped Evelyn through a hard time in her life, and now Fannie Flagg has helped me through a hard time in my life.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I've had the pleasure of seeing Ryan Adams in concert and listening to Gold.  He's only in his late 20's, but he reminds me of a young Neil Young or Bob Dylan.  If Gold were a little more focused, it would be perfect.  Yet even a little rambling, it is a tremendous album.  I look forward to his next piece of work.
0192833588|2.0|As SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY (S&amp;S) was Austen's first published novel, it is perhaps a forgivable sin that this work is almost wholly without that inimitable touch of greatness that makes her later works so wonderful.  To be sure, S&amp;S is not completely without charm;  as usual, her characters are described along the same uber ironic and caustic lines familiar to fans of her later work, and the soap operish quality of the narrative is, as always, tempered by her wry wit.  When Austen sets her baleful eye on the often ridiculous mores of her society, deftly skewing her demographic representing characters with the graceful, devastating wit she made her stock and trade, there is no one better.  Yet, in S&amp;S, the other part of what makes Austen so great - the biting, social commentary which is always indistinguishably entwined with plot and that sterling character development we've come to expect - is absent.  And though Austen sets her novel up as a didactic tale centering around an overmeasure of both sensibility and emotional excessivity, in the end she fails to create any application, to make sense of the lessons she so clearly intended to teach.  The two main characters seem to have suffered trial after trial for nothing, and the rest of the characters, those that MADE them suffer, get off scot-free.  That sense of Austen Justice so unavoidable in her later efforts is conspicuously absent here, leaving the narrative in want of purpose and the reader ultimately dissatisfied.<br />A lesser effort from one just setting her foot on the Alpine Path to greatness.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana is my favorite band of all time, so you'd assume I'd have a biased opinion; but, luckily for you--I don't.  In this long awaited selection of Nirvana's \\"Greatest Hits\\" that has breeded out of the long overdue resolution of the Love vs. Novoselic-Grohl dispute we are given the 14 tracks that are supposedly Nirvana's greatest songs. Here's where the question arises...Their greatest songs artistically and to their fans, or their greatest songs that sold the most?<br />Sadly, the answer is the latter.  In quick succession, singles are rattled off, four of which are the first couple tracks off of Nevermind (Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are; also Lithium though it wasn't one of the first hree tracks on Nevermind), leaving out songs like Drain You, Aneurysm, Sappy, Polly, and Milk It, for In Bloom and The Man Who Sold the World.  Sure, it was a good David Bowie cover, but that over a song like Polly, Aneurysm, or Drain You? I don't think so. 1 song from Bleach, 2 from Incesticide, and yes the rest are from Nevermind and In Utero.  This CD could have been given a five stars, if it wasn't for the poor track selection.<br />Why, then did I buy this, instead of just listening to their old studio albums and downloading the powerful previously unreleased single, \\"You Know You're Right\\"?  1) Because the liner notes are masterfully written and is a must read for any Nirvana fan 2) The remastered version of Pennyroyal Tea (Kurt always commented it seemed \\"unfinished), and polished studio version of You Know You're Right 3) The live takes from Unplugged and finally the biggest reason of all: Most Nirvana fans need this to pacify them until 2004 when the box set should be released...<br />This box set is what this should have been---A compilation of all the demo tapes Courtney is holding, the live recordings, bootlegs of stuff, and material we don't already have.  So, should you buy this CD?  If you're a die-hard Nirvana fan--Yes.  If you have an Internet connection and can get You Know You're Right Yourself--No.
0743420373|2.0|June 2002:  Anyone wanting to learn how to make money should buy one of Andrew Tobias' books and use this one to stop that kitchen table that you bought 30 years ago from rocking back and forth. Thomas J. (my other car is a Z-28) Stanley and William D. Danko go to great statistical links to explain why your neighbor has more money than you. In fact, this book is overloaded with statistics on everything imaginable.<br />There is some practical information here, but the reader has to be ready to wade through mounds of data and numbers. Much of the information is obvious, too. In a nutshell, want to save a lot of money? Don't spend any!<br />Stanley and Danko have published their doctoral theses and made a lot of money in doing so. Now Stanley is going to tell us about the Millionaire Mind? I haven't looked at that one yet, but I'll bet a quick thumbing of the book will show a lot of charts and stats. Prepare to help Stanley get richer at your expense and prepare to be bored.<br />October 2002 - After looking at this book again, I decided to adjust my thinking a bit on its usefulness.  It is true that there are many people out there that would find the tips and views presented here useful because they would seem to be a revelation. <br />Many people live above their means in this country and their competitive nature requires that they buy a new car every few years or engage in some other type of conspicuous consumption that in the long run only wastes their wealth.<br />But to many of us the tips in this book won't be revealing at all.  I recall reading a book on wealth building a few years ago in which the author suggested that ways to save money include re-using the blade in your razor several times rather than discarding it after one shave (do people really do that?) and bringing your lunch to work rather than going out to eat (among other things).  The &quot;revelations&quot; in Stanley and Danko's book seem as obvious to me as those suggestions.<br />If you reallywant a study of millionaires in this country, I guess this book is a decent one (though dated now).  However, my assumption is that most people who see this book will look at it as a &quot;how to...&quot;  And some of it may be &quot;how to&quot; if you are among those who have money but seem at a loss as to why you can't save.  Some of these stories can be helpful in that sense.<br />I still maintain that if you are looking for wealth building tips, pick up Andrew Tobias' book &quot;The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need&quot;.  It's much better at helping a reader understand how things work and how best to use your money.
0783225725|5.0|A powerfully moving film, directed and acted with subtlety.  The story engages the viewer from the beginning to the end, and this is not a story easily forgotten.  One comment, a previous reviewer asserted with certainty the stranger was the ghost of the marshall, but Clint Eastwood himself has said this is not so.  On his official website he is quoted as saying \\"In High Plains Drifter he is the bereaved brother who comes back and persecutes the people for their apathy or corruption.\\"
B000002KYH|3.0|As the back cover reads, &quot;In order to facilitate a single, specially-priced cd, the songs &quot;The Great Pretender,&quot; and &quot;I Guess I'll Always Love You,&quot; have been removed.&quot;  HELLO??!!  The main selling point of this album was the inclusion of those tracks as they were not available elsewhere!  Both performances added immeasureably to the appeal of this collection, and these songs, as with Stewart's original and definitive reading of Burt Bacharach's &quot;That's What Friends Are For,&quot; have yet to reappear on subsequent retrospectives. Stick with the vinyl until Warner does this one right.
0789723107|3.0|Mr. Krug thoughtfully points out usability issues that every web developer should be aware of, and his points are well-considered ones. But there are some serious flaws. To begin with is his definition of \\"usability\\" -- usability for whom? Mr. Krug completely ignores web accessibility issues for persons with disabilities. The web-viewing public he is concerned with have no disabilities that make reading pages difficult or impossible, do not use assistive technologies, or do not use old browsers. The author fails to mention that approximately 20% of web surfers have some form of disability, and fails to suggest online or book resources for learning more about this issue. Designing for ALL surfers is not, as he would put it, 'rocket surgery'. Is he really unaware of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines as put forth by the W3C or of section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act? His sections about navigation are absurdly one-sided. Does he truly think that javascripted navigation, or navigation with tabs are universally usable?<br />Secondly, the author is still stuck in largely tables-based HTML presentation methods. Usability means building a site that works on hand-held and telephonic devices as well as assistive interenet devices. This can be accomplished through XHTML and Cascading Style Sheets. In fact, separating markup from presentation is a large part of what Mr. Krug should be discussing, but doesn't.<br />Thirdly, Mr. Krug's examples are of large, well-branded sites. That's fine, but his comments and suggestions seem best-suited to those sites, not small business or other small-site needs. This shows in his lack of information about designing pages that will expedite search engine effectiveness. In fact, he outright dismisses the usefulness of the introductory paragraph often found on homepages as \\"happy talk\\", stating that \\"happy talk must die\\" (p. 46). Many search engines print this paragraph, or a portion of it, as part of the information you see when you'researching for a topic. Why not tell developers how to utilize this paragraph to advantage? Is it because his examples are large sites with well-known branding that don't require additional information? The wording of that paragraph can make or break a search engine user's decision about visiting a site.<br />Even though it is painfully lacking in some very vital information, Mr. Krug's book is worth reading. However, a savvy developer will not take everything he says as gospel, but will continue to learn more about what usability *really* is, what new developments are coming 'round the bend, and will seek out more fully-rounded information before committing development hours and money just to end up with a half-usable site.
B000000W6F|4.0|A debut album says many things about a band. Many people view it as merely a first attempt, while this is true, it says much more on many other levels. It primarily states what you can expect from this band. As a result there generally is little variation, and the songs can often only hint at the greatness of the songwriters behind them.<br />This album is no exception.<br />From the moment you start the CD, it becomes startlingly obvious that this is going to be a musical experience like no other before it. The strange blend of Hard Rock, 60's era psychadellic rock and Punk that is 'I AM ONE' states with full confidence what this band set out to achieve - to change rock music forever.<BR>This odd musical fusion continues throughout the album, which really adds to the raw essense that is poured into this record. Classic examples of this are 'SIVA', 'BURY ME' and 'TRISTESSA', which also make it easy to see why people flocked to see them live before they became a signed bend. Also, 'SIVA' displays the classic Corgan technique of going from loud to soft and back again in half a heartbeat, which later became a staple for songs on the album 'MELLON COLLIE AND THE INFINATE SADNESS'.<BR>The Pumpkins also explore their melodic side through tracks like 'RHINOCEROUS', 'SUFFER' and 'DAYDREAM', the latter of which being sung by Darcy (the bassist in the band).<br />This album really is a classic example of what a debut album should be - a statement about what a band wants to achieve and how it is going to set about doing it. While the pumpkins may not have changed music, they definately made it more interesting.
B00005ASOI|5.0|From its astonishing opening sequence, this is a film that grips and bewitches in equal measure. The director's masterful use of the widescreen ratio balances foreground events with the whispered conversations that create the atmosphere of intense and disturbing conspiracy that sustains the momentum to the end. In between, the celebrated set pieces cannot fail to shock and amaze a first-time viewer, but it is the more subtle effects that will keep you coming back for repeated viewings.<br />Thank God for the DVD format, where the colours are properly balanced and you don't have to put up with the panned and scanned travesty that use to exist on tape. It's just a shame that there are another few minutes of film in existence: cuts from a Dario Argento film are always a disappointment.
6302814359|2.0|ASIDE FROM SOME NICE ZOMBIE F/X, &quot;RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD II&quot; IS A MESS. LET'S START WITH THE CONS... THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY ANNOYING, THE UNFORGIVABLE ONE LINERS ARE NON-STOP (EXAMPLE: &quot;MAKE MY NIGHT!&quot;), BEYOND BAD DIALOGUE (EXAMPLE: YOUR BRAIN SMELLS RICH &amp; SPICY.&quot;), THE ACTING IS WORSE THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE, THE STORY HAS YOU ASKING THE QUESTION &quot;WAS THERE A SCRIPT?&quot;. AFTER ALL THIS YOU MIGHT SAY &quot;BRIAN, WHY EVEN 2 STARS?&quot;. THIS IS WHERE I GIVE YOU THE FILMS ONE PRO... THE ZOMBIES DO LOOK COOL. I LIKED THE F/X &amp; THE GORE MAKE-UP.

B00006JLX4|5.0|This is THE Pavement album.  It sounds nothing like any other Pavement albums that followed (and those are Mmm Mmm Good too!).<BR>I consider this the greatest album I have ever heard and the most artistic, expressionistic, hook-laden album that has ever entered my ears.  This is the perfect indie rock album that set the standard...and will take something special to top it. <BR>And all the extra stuff?  Brilliant, flawless, addictive.  Need I say more?  <BR>Throw out your radio friendly Creed and Blink 182, and buy this.  Very few artists can ever achieve the greatness that this album (and band) ever possessed.
B000069AT7|5.0|When I heard that there was an \\"ultimate edition\\" of E.T. being released, there was no single doubt in my mind that I would be purchasing that edition. . . even after I saw the price.  I read somewhere that someone called this edition over-priced, but after just seeing the extras on the third DVD, I couldn't believe it was so [inexpensive]!<br />The first DVD contains the 2002 release edition with all the amazing special effects.  One of the most fascinating aspects of this version is that for the premere of the movie, they had a large full piece orchestra play the soundtrack live conducted by Master John Williams while the movie was shown to the audience.  On the DVD you can choose the option to watch the movie with that incredible live mix, complete with audience reaction that, through the magic of surround sound, really makes you feel like you were there.  This is an absolutely amazing way to watch the film.  If you are a fan of John Williams, this feature alone is worth the price of the set.<br />The second DVD contains the original 1982 version as it was first introduced to the world.  It offers a really fun way to compare the enhancements made with the original footage and allows you to capture the nostalgic feelings you get about this old alien friend.<br />The third DVD special features offer a behind the scenes look at the magic that Speilberg and his creative team.  The reunion documentary gives you a fun look at the people as they are today reflecting back on their experience of making the movie.  Also included is a special documentary showcasing the incredible effort made for the 2002 premiere with the live orchestra.  This DVD is only available through this edition and it is very much worth the price you pay.<br />There is a book included with the set that offers a myriade of photos and reflections.  You are taken from the first creation of the idea, through the beautiful screenplay, the making and finally the restoration.  You also get a piece of an actual frame from the movie, John Williams award-winning, masterful soundtrack, and a certificate of authenticity for the whole package.<br />I have loved the movie E.T. since I first saw it at the age of six.  Back then, I was a lot like Drew Barrymore in how I viewed that odd little alien.  As I've grown, I've caught more of the [$] DVD edition and still enjoyed the magic of this film.  But I have absolutely no regrets in buying this edition.  It may seem like a lot of money to pay, but once you start experiencing all this edition has to offer, you begin to realize that it should have cost much more than what you actually paid.  This ultimate edition is the only way to go!
0316666343|5.0|I truly could not put this book down. The perspective of the narrator, the change in settings, and the vivid descriptions of what one imagines heaven to be are just so unique. This book encompasses such a spectrum of human emotions: loss, longing, love between lovers,families,and neighbors, anger, denial, and forgiveness. There was just one part towards the end of the book which seemed out of place, but I would give it away if I tried to describe it. Nevertheless, this book is both lovely and amazing.
B00006CXXU|5.0|this is an excellent album. a great follow up for christina. far more mature than her debut. and worth your money - 20 tracks. highly recommend!
B0000028M7|5.0|A record of extreme power, aggression, and hopelessness, yet also a record of beauty and light acoustics, this is a record just as diverse as any AIC album, but this one is just the best.  Songs like \\"Them Bones\\" show the mean, heavy side of Alice, with scorching waves of heavy guitar, chugging drums, and vocals about as nasal as humanly possible.  The late Layne Staley's voice is toned to utter perfection on every last track,  most noticable on the very moving and personal tearjerker, \\"Rooster\\".  \\"Rooster\\" is great in more ways than just it was a great song: it also shows all sides of Alice's music, with verses that are very mellow and acoustic, but the refrain is very powerful, with an infectious riff and nearly transparent drums.  The drums low level in \\"Rooster\\" is only due to the riff, which overshadows all with its power and emotion.  The 12th track, \\"Angry Chair\\", explores the heavy side of Alice, with powerful guitars, heavy drums with a lot of cybmals, and the bass tying it all together along with Layne's vocals, which accompany \\"Angry Chair\\" just as well as they do on the rest of the album.  \\"Would?\\", the final cut, also explores both sides of Alice, only this time at a much faster speed than \\"Rooster.\\"  \\"God Smack\\", another great song, explores a mid-heaviness level combined with fast drums and bass, yet Jerry Cantrell's guitars aren't as apparent on the rest of the album.  Overall, this album shows all the sides of what Alice In Chains can bring, which is obviously awesome.  The late Layne Staley's vocals preside over a barrage Jerry Cantrell's guitar, (Jerry's solos are as majestic as any great preceding band, like Metallica and Led Zeppelin), Mike Starr's bass (who has since been replaced by Mike Inez) and Sean Kinney's drums.  Overall, this album taps all of the musical talent of these 4 artists to create \\"Dirt\\", the best record of 1992, and one of the best of the entire decade.  Fans of grunge, metal, or hard rock should get this.  You won't be disapointed.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Truly reaching nirvana, this album featuring 14 classic tracks from the most influential band of the past 25 years is a mixture of emotion.  Kurt Cobain epitomized the essence of the true meaning of music.  He believed in the fans and his band, not the corporate side which  dominates the music industry today.  Any fan of music would appreciate the honesty and power found inside this collection.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow. I was blown away upon hearing this album. The production's hot, the lyrics are great and Christina's vocals are amazing. I really love this album, it's excellent.
B00006CXXU|5.0|They way that she takes on the different genres of music is amazing. \\"Fighter\\" and \\"Make Over are two of my favorite songs. This album proves that Ms. Aguilera can do rock, soul, r&b, blues, and hip hop music. Stripped is one of the best albums of the year. It should definitely be in the grammy race!
B00005ATQI|5.0|This is the scariest, as well as one of the wierdest movies I have ever seen. This movie is scary. Period. I challenge anyone to watch this movie at night, completely alone, with all the lights turned off. I could not do it.

B00006LLNU|5.0|Well, I'll start this off by saying that I have sort of been with this band since the beginning, at least in this country.  For some reason, I heard about Sigur Rs right when their CD was released in the US and I have to say that I wasn't initially impressed very much.  However, as time went on and I left their debut CD in my stereo, it grew on me with a frenzy that has taken until just recently to peak.  To me, it's really convenient that they just released their second (and first major label) CD, ()  Of course, anyone's initial reaction would be that it's just a pile of pretentious jargon meant to bring back the glory days of prog-rock/art-rock.  Admittedly, this release (and the band itself) is pretty atmospheric and as artsy as they come, but they put such an orchestral rock twist on their music that it definitively distinguishes Sigur Rs from the Moby's of the world.  () has some of the most wonderfully textured songs I have ever had the joy of hearing.  This new CD builds on their debut and maintains all the positives of it.  The vocals soar blissfully like a seraphim one moment and are dampened by the sheer orchestral weight of the band the next.  The first third of the CD reminds me of Agaetis Byrjun with their uplifting melodies sprinkled with soft piano lines and vocals that make you feel like you are drifting off in space.  &quot;Track 5&quot; brings you back down to Earth, slowly but surely.  When you come back down, you still aren't fully sure where you are.  When &quot;Track 6&quot; comes along, the clouds start rolling in and you realize you're in for some inclimate weather the likes of which you've never experienced.  Little did you know that what lies ahead is a hurricane, the front end being &quot;Track 7.&quot;  It mixes some slight Pink Floyd/Godspeed You Black Emperor! atmosphere with Sigur Rs instrumentation.  The vocals will saturate you in euphoric ways.  This is all a build to the CD's closing track, &quot;Track 8.&quot;  This 11 minute epic begins with the eye of the storm, soothing and fairly anxious.  As the track floats along, you begin to feel that something powerful is coming.  About 5 minutes into the song, it arrives and builds up into the earth-shattering climax of the CD.  It will blow you away.  () is a journey.  Sigur Rs would like you to go along with them.  They'll let you get overwhelmed at the end, but they're right there with you throughout the entire process.  This is one of the best CDs of the young century.
B000068TPN|5.0|Technotactically, the film shows the fire-swept weapons battlefield but with a new twist; both sides have full automatic assault rifles; M16s versus \\"AK-47s\\" (AKMs); with a trigger squeeze a group of men bunched together can be cut down. Moore has anticipated this, and as Crandall flies in ammo boxes, the later loaded 5.56mm magazines are distributed by conscious effort of the leaders--he and Plumley---to keep a \\"wall of fire\\" between them and the enemy regimental headquarters they have stumbled onto at the base of a forested mountain in the Ia Drang valley. Gibson's time spent weapons handling with the Benning Rangers results in Moore's palm slapping the bolt catch on his M16 after every magazine reload like a professional Soldier, an efficiency us lefties have a hard hard time duplicating.<br />The need for responsive Close Air Support (CAS) by a slow-moving aircraft like the A-1 SkyRaiders that can drop napalm is something we lack in the present day; making it questionable how we will fare if given the long odds for survival Moore's men faced. We see the technotactical ploys of the enemy to flank, countered by Moore's massing, then the enemy's \\"belt buckle\\" hugging countered by Moore's \\"mad minute\\" which shows that conflicts are often won or lost in the minds of the Commanders. The Commander with the last remaining trump usually triumphs--in those dark days in the Ia Drang, Moore's \\"broken arrow\\" request for CAS and ability to feed fresh troops into battle by helicopter held together by his skilled on-the-scene, personal leadership won the fight.<br />After the battle, where Moore had acted with complete disregard for his own safety, he feels survivor's guilt as a moral man aware of his fallen troopers sacrifices and insists that someday AP photographer Joe Galloway tell the sleeping American public what his men did to protect their freedom and the price they paid; the genesis of the book and this film. Moore knows that if he does not act, his men will be as forgotten as much as they were ignored when they left---he will not tolerate this--he fights back---he just doesn't bring his men back home alive or to be buried; he brings them back home to our hearts so they will be remembered forever by every generation of living Americans when they reflect on the lives of peace they get to enjoy and how they must also be Soldiers even if they are young.<br />The film as all films are under a serious time pressure, has two huge flaws that can fortunately can be fixed by a \\"director's cut\\" using some additional scenes. As-is, the film may make you think that tactical AIRCRAFT did most of the killing and if our men-on-the-ground endured so much agony, their families endured so much grief, why not just leave our ground Soldiers out of it? If all war is; is the act of exploding and killing, why not just do it from the air as western democracies are wont to embrace as a panacea? This is the result of a misunderstanding that the film's scripting/editing creates; a lack of geostrategic perspective that was the true cause of the men being hastily sent in 1965. Unless I failed to hear the film clearly, we are presented that the 1st Air Cavalry was sent in as a symbolic gesture to prop up a faltering South Vietnam, when the truth is much more than that.<br />I believe a scene should be added where the two senior Pentagon officers point a finger at a map of South Vietnam and describe how its narrow at the Central Highlands near Pleiku and with the enemy massing somewhere there, they could cut the nation into two by ground maneuver. The scene where Moore and Plumley land and get their orders to seek and find the massing enemy should reinforce this point by a sub-title caption reading \\"Assembly Area, X miles from Pleiku\\" etc. to connect the fact that the 1st Air Cavalry was sent to counter the MANEUVER of the enemy from holding important ground not as just another way of killing enemies using helicopters and Sky Soldiers.<br />Another missing aspect of the film is that the Army was developing a light tracked tank called the AR/AAV that would be deliverable by helicopter but was not available at the time of the 1965 battle. The details of this are recounted by General Moore in General David L. Grange's \\"Air-Mech-Strike\\" book. The first scenes in the movie where Pentagon officers select Moore where they mention his experimental parachute work for General Gavin should be modified in the director's cut to bring up the fact that Moore had worked on the AR/AAV light airdroppable tank that could be lifted by a helicopter but its not ready and the situation in Vietnam is too critical to wait. The officers should remark that the Air Cav will have to fight with what they carry in their hands and on their backs. They should end by saying they hope it will be enough.<br />In this subtle way, the conclusion of the movie would be more accurate and not feed into the current aversion to using ground troops which results in enemies escaping, while providing the audience a valuable \\"lessons learned\\" that America must IMPROVE the WAY she sends her men to fight; by declaring war so the entire nation rallies behind the men spiritually and physically to include supplying them with ALL the tools they need--to include a light tracked armored vehicle so gatling guns will not be left behind as Custer did. If the weather had gone sour, the \\"guns\\" on the aircraft could not have flown to assist Moore in his successful stand---future Air Cav type units must instead land with their own gatling guns on armored mounts with lots of ammo to insure they can sweep the areas of \\"indians\\" and win the fight to come home again.missing aspect of the film is that the Army was developing a light tracked tank called the AR/AAV that would be deliverable by helicopter but was not available at the time of the 1965 battle.

B00006K15D|5.0|The original Terminator was a good movie. But T2 blows that one away!!! Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy in this astounding sequel. He is sent to protect John Conner, a rebellious teenager who will be the leader and savior of earth in the future. The ultimate enemy in this blockbuster movie is none other than the almighty T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a killing machine made of liquid metal. The Terminator (Arnold) must protect John Conner from the T-1000. The word as not yet been invented to describe the special effects, especially the most nightmarish holocaust scene yet! Ofcourse, this movie is loaded with strong intense violence and action, as well as profanity. This is the best sci-fi action film ever!!! Watch it for yourself and try to make up your own mind. This movie will blow you away!!! It's very moving, gripping, and absolutely unforgettable.
B00006IUL7|1.0|Perhaps the most boring movie I've seen this year. The sleepier Al Pachino got the sleepier I got. My wife fell asleep half way through the movie. If she only knew how lucky she was.
B00005JK8K|1.0|if there were an award for the worst pictures of 2002, i would nominate this.  this movie managed to take a potentially good story and make a mishmash of utter nonsense out of it.  nicholas cage's emotions run the full gamut from very angry to very, very angry with absolutely nothing in between or at either end.  if one is fond of gruatuitous violence this is the movie for you.  i quit watching at the completely improbable scene of the navajo, whom cage was to be shepherding, dressing in a japanese uniform and &quot;pretending&quot; he had captured cage.  this only served to allow more staged violence.  and, by the way, i noted the deciduous trees on &quot;saipan&quot; exhibiting their fall colors???  where was this thing filmed?  numerous grade b saturday morning cowboy movies were more believable.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Just forget about her looks.... They might be your taste or not. That is a totally different issue. Fact is: This CD is truly outstanding!<br />Not convinced by the first single 'dirrty' including the controversial video I thought I might give it a try. Christina's amazing voice and a recent documentary about her rise made me very curious about this release. In fact I am overwhelmed by these songs.<br />You might expect something very upbeat in an R&amp;B style but most of the songs are wonderfully arranged ballads combined with an unbelievably strong voice.<br />The one which stands out (for me) is the song &quot;Impossible&quot; arranged and written by Alicia Keys. Simply wonderful... it nearly made me cry!<br />I am not going to describe all the songs but I can tell you there is not a single one which is bad... even dirrty (I think the weakest song here) is slowly, very slowly growing on me.<br />Buy it, just buy it and do yourself a favour! ....and just for the record: I am not a Christina fan.... not yet!
B00006LLNU|5.0|A perfect continuation of their last album.  Soaring.  Hypnotic.  Brilliant.  I have Track No. 8 stuck in my head permanently.  The lack of album title and song titles might be off-puting to some but, heck, who could pronounce the titles anyway?<BR>This is perfect headphone music and also works as wonderful road music.  Sigur Ros are touring the US and Canada right now. Be sure to catch their show and buy this CD.  It's important to let the music industry know that we want to hear good music and not just the [stuff] they play on the radio.
B000005JA8|1.0|This is absolute torture to listen to.  People that give this album five stars are more interested in being avant-garde and name-dropping than actually listening to the music.  This is simply terrible, even if you like Frank Zappa.  This is one of the worst records I've ever heard, and I've listened to it several times to be sure I'm not giving it short shrift.  This is the musical equivalent of the raving lunatic yelling at his backpack or shoelaces on the street.  Maybe HE thinks it's important, but you'd be stupid to feel the same.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This being the proper follow up to her Grammy Award winning multi-platinum debuet album is outstanding.Stripped is the album of the year.From ballads to uptempos,from rock to r&b this album shows Christinas amazing range of music influences.Stand out tracks?Too many to count.From the albums next impowering single \\"Beautiful\\" to the very funky soul driven \\"Impossible\\" Aguilera shows her amazing vocal power.The power anthem \\"Cant Hold Us Down\\" shows that Aguilera can be put in the same spots of other top notch female singers.Its a very uplifting album about finding yourself and who you think you can be.Dont judge the album by the first single \\"Dirrty\\".Its been 3 years in the making and this already critcally acclaimed album is one that you must pick up.Some artists take years to release an album like this and this 3 time Grammy Winner took only 3 years to do so.Do NOT sleep on this album and take it just as a regular cd you will be amazed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Sophomore albums are always very tricky especially if your debut was a runaway success. Everybody wants more of the same from you but at the same time, if it sounds too similar, they'll say the music has stagnated or become unimaginative. The sophomore curse hits the best of them, just look at Macy Gray and Tracy Chapman. Add to that, the pressure to distance oneself from the teenybopper nametag and you'll see why Christina Aguilera MUST produce an album such as this. <br />     It has been more than four years since her debut. The development and growth shows in her vocal range and control as she presents an edgier and gutsier side of herself. 'Stripped' is a lyrical journey of a former little-girl-lost who has just begun to find her voice in the confusing world of pop. In the first interlude, she invites you to see her as she is, stripped of all the hype and rumours and beyond the diva the media makes her out to be. From then onwards, it's a roller coaster ride into what the girl wants and lost. <br />     Heartache and the road to recovery from one is a theme evident throughout the record, as she sings of how she loses control by returning to the one thing she needs to distance herself from ('Walk Away'), of how the betrayal and backstabbing made her that much wiser and stronger ('Fighter') and why she needs to break free after all the years she's been violated ('Make Over'). It's not all gloomy though as she still professes hope in love but at her own terms ('Loving Me For Me') and of  that crush for the irresistable latin lover ('Infatuation'). In the midst of it all,  Aguilera also manages to dispense some advise to all the young girls to look inside themselves and trust the voice within ('The Voice Within') and to shout out loud and stand their ground (Can't Hold Us Down'.) <br />     She co-wrote most of the tracks and has engaged the assistance of some of the most talented people in the music business like Linda Perry (of 4-Non Blondes), Alicia Keys, Lil Kim and Glen Ballard. Linda Perry lends a world-weary feel to their collaborations and is most apparent in ,what is in my opinion, the best track of the CD, 'I'm OK'. In it Aguilera sings of child abuse and abandonment with so much angst and resignation that you'd think it's a personal account of her life. <br />     This is an album that grows on you after a few listens. Clearly, Aguilera has blossomed from a slick studio production into a veritable Queen of Pop with attitude. The lead-off single 'Dirrty' is a funky dance number which didn't go down too well with radio, but don't let that prevent you from giving this gem of an album a chance. You'll be surprised at its depth, range and maturity.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Please don't attempt to describe this album. If you don't get it, or don't understand why Sigur Ros is unbelievable, then all hope may be lost for you.
0316666343|5.0|The author should be applauded for her extraordinary use of point-of view, a person who has died and is speaking from heaven.  You get to know the narrator for the person she was as she looks down at her family and friends moving on without her.  I was very moved by the story and the detail that the author is able to give you about this girls life.  She is unable to speak or interact with the people she left on Earth but the people she knew are changed forever after her death.<br />It is such a an interesting read that I was unable to put it down, I wanted her to live again.  It is riveting and the characters are so real.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Easily on the short list of great albums of the past 3 years. Not recommended listening, its required.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I've listened through the album once, and here is my first impression: this is the type of album that will be critically acclaimed but will not produce the three #1 singles like her debut.  With an incredibly poor choice for cover art and first single/video &quot;Dirrty,&quot; it seems as if her label is trying to sell as few copies as possible of this mature and worthy LP.  It is surprisingly effective lyrically and Ms. Aguilera certainly takes some risks.  However, those very risks may be her downfall, as fans looking for &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; or &quot;Come on Over&quot; part two will leave disappointed.  Her vocals are still the best in the business and in the realm of Carey/Houston etc., but they are noticibly gritter...and while they match the edgy nature of the songs, I wonder if she will fall in the footsteps of idol Carey and sing herself out after her first few albums.  Since comparing her to obvious influence Carey is in fashion, I will say that she breaks away from the diva mold and creates her own identity with this album.  It just may not be what her fans want.  Better-written songs, and riskier, edgier vocals, but just not as much fun as I'd hoped.<BR>Lowlight: First Single &quot;Dirrty&quot;<BR>Highlight: &quot;The Voice Within&quot;
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink proves in her second album that she has the talent and the guts to move on, if not completely, from the formulaic, angry-young-woman dance tunes of her first album. Although this album does contain the requisite dance numbers, including the title track, and 'Get the Party Started', she also explores more of what has brought her to this point, and the self-doubt that has followed her success.<br />Pink ranges out of her core demographic, by telling stories that any age group can relate to. She sings of co-dependency and bad relationships on 'Just Like a Pill'; of being a misfit in 'Don't Let Me Get Me' in which she admits to being told she can be a pop star if she changes herself completely to be like Britney Spears; self-doubt about her fame on the beautiful 'Lonely Girl'; and of coming from a broken home on 'Family Portrait', in my opinion, the most moving song on the album, and the best example of Pink's talent.<br />What sets Pink apart from other pop or dance stars of her generation is her ability to morph and willingness to take risks, plus her talent transcends whatever look or style she projects. If she keeps this up, she will last as long as Madonna, since she has that same chameleon-like style, plus, a much stronger voice from the get-go. I completely enjoy this CD from start to finish.
6304675348|5.0|Legendary horror movie director Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) does an excellent job of reviving the good old-fashioned \\"scary Movie\\" genre that had been missing for several years.  A very good cast of actors, including Neve Campbell (Sidney), Skeet Ulrich (Billy), Courtney Cox (Gail), Drew Barrymore (Casey), Rose McGowan (Tatum), and David Arquette (Dewey) give top notch performances in this movie.  The overall premise of the film is good, too.  I also enjoyed the way that classic horror films such as \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Halloween\\" were blended in.  This is good old fashioned suspense and terror at its best. The plot is excellent and there are a lot of twists and turns that will keep the viewer  glued to the screen throughout.  This is a fun, suspenseful, and scary movie, and I highly recommend it.  You'll be sure to have a few \\"screams\\" along the way!!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|...The Soundtrack is Slammin' ONE THING I WOULD CHANGE macy gray?  Why is she on this Soundtrack? Thats like Relesing The Best of Beethoven Feturing Vanilla Ice. But I Just Wanted to say This is a Great Soundtrack and 'Lose yourself' is one amazing tune.  ...
B00006CXXU|5.0|Sugar-coated pop. We're all sick of it. With Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\", we can also see some artists are also sick of it. Ditching her 'teen pop idol/diva' image, Christina delves into risky, more \\"adult\\" territory for her sophomore album--not to say she doesn't pull it off. Aguilera's vocal range combined with rock, dance, and even a little latino show that this Genie has come out of her bottle.<br />She dishes out dance/club-esque songs with hits like 'Dirrty' (featuring Redman), gives a hip-hop edge on 'Can't Hold Us Down' (featuring Lil' Kim), hits us with some Spanish and latino beats on 'Infatuation', gives us grungy, heavy (for her) rock on 'Fighter' and produces a worthy ballad 'Beautiful'. It is surprising how enjoyable this CD is despite its constant shift in genres.<br />Standout songs being 'Dirrty' for its unique very dirty image, 'Beautiful' for its, well, beauty, 'Impossible' for the Alicia Keys composition, 'Fighter' for its guitar and vocals, and 'Make Over' for its unique blend of Spanish instrumentals and rock vocals providing a unqiue almost Middle-eastern/punk/pop/Spanish blend, this CD is a definite must-have. Despite being slightly lengthy (about 75 mins long, including Intros and Interludes), \\"Stripped\\" should be enjoyable throughout.
B00000GB24|5.0|Not only is a Portishead an amazing band, but the fact that they played a live concert that replicates normally recorded studio songs as a trip-hop band is not easily accomplished.  The sampling used to write the music for all Portishead songs is a long process where Geoff Barrow actually writes his own music to then sample from, makes Portishead's music completely unique and unreplicable.  But then to play this complicated sampled music in a live format is something that should be praised and appreciated.  Most trip-hop bands don't tour (at least not often, with the exception of Tricky).  Anyone into Portishead or trip-hop music must have this album. (I wish I could have been there, but the album does a wonderful job of making you feel a part of it all.  I would also recommend the VHS video or DVD of this performance.)
B00006CXXU|5.0|For someone that has definitely been receiving a lot of negativity for a few years now about her professional/personal life, Ms. Aguilera has looked past it all and produced one of what I think is the best albums of the year. She is a beautiful individual, pulling all the stops with album letting everyone know that no matter what they say she is who she is. Its about the music that she makes and not what she is or isnt doing behind closed doors. I HIGHLY recommend this album, it's soulful, up beat, and Christina is definitely \\"Stripped\\".
0399226907|3.0|I thought that The Very Hungry Caterpillar was a great story. It is a great book for kids of all ages.  When I was little I read lots of times maybe everyday so you see its great book. It tells the story of a caterpillar from its birth through its growing but I don't want to give away the ending. The author really Knew what he was doing because he created one of the greatest children's books ever. He used vibrant colors and little words. This book is worth every penny believe me your kids will read it over and over again.
B00005OC0G|5.0|I am such a fan of this recording!  I've got Heifetz, and Kreisler playing the Beethoven Concerto. I have Oistrakh playing the Romances...they just aren't the same.  This is such a vibrant recording..so full of life!  Beethoven would have approved, I'm sure..just as Kreisler certainly would have enjoyed her playing of his cadenzas.  This is a must have have!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|With the exception of a couple of songs, The 8 Mile soundtrank displays a variety of music.  The album features Macy Gray and Boomkat, a hiatus to the rest of the album's rap.  From fast beats to rythmic lyrics, the soundtrack , hopefully, will go well with the up coming movie.  Although some songs have lyrics aimed at other areas than the movie that make the soundtrack like an album, talking about D'Angelo and other rappers, and musical artists.  Overall a good buy, with many quality tracks.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am not a fussy music listener. I will listen (and most likely enjoy) almost anything from britney to Mudvayne to Aerosmith to the Rolling Stones. But nothing can compare to this (and other) Radiohead albums. I first listened to this Album when it first came out in97. There was as yet no radio play. And I have to admit I didn't love it. I didn't hate it, but I was yet to hear the full brilliance of the album. I was sitting there casually skipping through songs. But then one day I sat down and listened to the album right through. And what struck me is the power the album had to move me. I have never felt anything like that day when Exit music (for a film) came on, and it remains to this day the only album I have ever heard where I can comfortably listen right through and really love it. Yes you can enjoy Radiohead if you like pop or even Heavy metal. My best friend will only listen to (very) heavy metal, except for this album. It trancends boundaries and was rightfully given a place in some reviewers best albums of all time.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I bought Christina Aguilera's new CD the day it came out. I was expecting it to be...well, of course, DIRTY, provacative, sexual, and dominately hip hop. I was VERY wrong. At the most, there were about 4 provacative songs (not too bad considering her debut song & video) and the flavor of her music was more original, less hip hop than I expected. It blends pop, hip hop, and a little rock flair with meaningful lyrics. Of course, her voice is strong and empowering as usual, and in songs like \\"Fighter\\", \\"Beautiful\\", and \\"Impossible\\" it shines through beautifully. You can tell this album really did mean a lot to her...it sounds as if it came from the heart, which you don't always expect from a *pop star*. Overall, I'd say this album was pretty dang good, and will rise to the top when compared to the work of her fellow divas/pop rivals.
B00004XONN|5.0|How do you follow an album like OK Computer?  An album that has been critically acclaimed as one of the best ever?<br />With this!<br />Wherever OK Computer was ranked in the top 20 albums ever it just dropped a place.  This leaves their other masterpieces for dead.  It is the most amazing 50 minutes of music i have heard.  Whoever said this is lifeless, is lifeless or just scared to step out of the comfort of commercially taylored music.<br />If you have not heard much Radiohead before this album may take a few listens, but i would still recommend it, along with 'OK Computer' and 'The Bends' if you are looking for something a little more mainstream.
6304779356|4.0|First of all, I'd like to know what the deal is with the poster on Corey Haim's wall.  You know what I'm talking about, the one with the muscle guy in the tank-top, running his hand up underneath it exposing his mid-section.  I'm not talking about a poster of a woman, it's a man... man.  Is that some sort of homoerotic inference?  Then there's the dainty little earring, the whole bath scene with him singing, \\"I ain't got a man,\\" the hawaiian shirts... then there's the inseperable Frog brothers, the list just keeps going.<br />Anyway, all that \\"... Theory\\" aside, this is a unique vampire movie.  It takes into account the pressures and horrors of adolescents; the changes, peer pressure (being one of the crowd), the complete surprise at the awkwardness following those changes.  Vampiricism is displayed as a facility of all this; it's cool, it's desirable, it's a great way to meet girls, and most importantly, it makes you superior to everyone else.  That's brilliant.  And yet somehow the movie manages to maintain all the lushness that the myth of vampires incurs.  These rough teenage ... are at once immature and wild but also aged, wise, elegant and beautiful.<br />So yeah, buy the movie.  It loses one star simply because of the horrible way all the non-vampire characters were handled.  Especially Grandpa.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This CD is not an easy album, and at first its songs might sound pretty much the same, but as soon as it grows on you it's absolutely awesome! OK, this band may not be your typical 1980s metal band, but it still rocks.<br />The album kicks off with Are You Ready (5/5) which is the perfect in-your-face intro to this album. Then comes What If (4/5), a great heavy track which might be overshadowed by its perfect predecessor. Beautiful (5/5) is the song with the catchy chorus which seems to be coming out of Metallica's BLACK ALBUM. Say I (4/5) and Wrong Way (4/5) are another good track which grow on you whilst Faceless Man (5/5) is the album's epic. Unfortunately, after such a great track, comes the weakest song on the CD, Never Die (3/5), which isn't bad is very unimaginative unlike other Creed songs on this CD. With Arms Wide Open (5/5) lives up to it's rock ballad status with a personal message; unfortunately this song has been played on radio stations till our ears bled. Higher (5/5) is the climax of this album, Creed at their bloody best. Wash Away Those Years (5/5) is another masterpiece with the CD's most poetic verse .... 'don't hold your tears .... they were sent to wash away those years'. Inside Us All (5/5) is a beautiful closing track with moral message.<br />What bothers me is the way people unfairly criticise Creed, saying that they preach too much Christianity in their songs. Apart from the fact that this is not true, I feel that Creed's lyrics are priceless because they preach values which should be common for all religions such as peace, love, brotherhood and friendship in a time where we are killing each other and hating each other's guts. Creed's lyrics should profoundly touch the heart of a Jew, Muslim, Buddhist or Hindu as much as it should to a Christian.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I just bought this cd today, and I'm already totally in love with it. I've never really liked her music or image, but I heard this song &quot;Impossible&quot; that my friend had downloaded and it was awesome. I decided to buy the album, and it is very good. I think the best tracks are &quot;Impossible&quot;, &quot;Infatuation&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful&quot;. All of them are good though, and her cd has some what of a rock/latin feel to a lot of the songs. I think the ballads are the strongest though because of her wonderful voice. The downside is that some of the upbeat songs sound kind of the same.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Run out and buy this on principle alone.  This is the Sgt. Pepper's of the 90's (or Revolver, or White Album, or whatever).  On a personal note, I credit this album alone for my introduction and long-standing love affair with indie music.  I'm sure most people reading this remember the first time they heard it too, sitting there with your jaws on the floor.  It is that good, the hype is real.<br />Anyway, Matador, one of the premier indie labels in the country, has finally released the remastered disc including live footage and unreleased tracks.  I believe it's to celebrate S&amp;E's 10th anniversiary.  The studio album itself remains revolutionary, even upon it's 5,000th listening.  It might be ten years old, but each track still reaffirms everything that is wrong with commercial radio and its cohorts.  I'll take Steve Malkmus' lyrical obscurity over just about anything out there.  The live versions are pure fun, a nostalgiac trip back to the days when grunge was king.  Of course, if you like Pavement, you probably laughed at anyone wearing flanel, but I guess that's half the enjoyment in reliving their old, live shows.  Summer Babe is still the best song ever to sing along to.<br />This disc should be to music fans what combat boots are to Marines - standard issue.
B00004Z459|4.0|I believe this CD is excellent because the songs are a great mix of rap, rock, and even techno. Linkin Park shows in this CD that they can make great songs using beats from the rock genre and lyrics from the rap genre. Also, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; offers more than just bland, repetative songs in which someone would lose interest. The songs in &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; have an effect on the listener by making him/her let a lot of closed in emotions out. If you enjoy rap/rock bands such as Limp Bizkit, then this CD is for you.<br />     There's no doubt that this CD has a lot to offer, but I feel that only 40 minutes for any CD wouldn't be long enough to be perfect. But Other than that, this CD is great.
B000002C25|2.0|Brand Here Now<br />The older pop gets, the more constrained to age groups its appeal becomes. Young people have own youth cultures just like we had (and still do) had ours. Perhaps this explains why you'd have to put me in a straitjacket and tie to a chair t o m ake me listen to Be Here Now again. For me it is unfathomable how a record as substanceless as Be Here Now can have such a broad appeal. I thought Definitely Maybe had some punky appeal and real attitiude but the bigger Oasis became, the hollower the i r mu sic sounded. Be Here Now is the sound of a band that could do what they wanted - Carte Blanche - and what do they choose to do? They become 1967-era Beatles Mk. II. Paul McCartney once said how sad he was about all these bands trying so hard to sound like the Beatles. Surely the point is to try and accomplish something new and exciting (like Beck, Tortoise, Labradford and Jim O'Rourke). The songwriting-by-numbers approach of Noel Gallagher sometimes comes up trumps, but how a whole generation can embrace this as one of the best albums of all time is indicative of one of two things: either standards have fallen woefully low or the music industry has managed to turn pop into a global brand-oriented commodity. And by the way, if you think I'm the only one who thinks Be Here Now is poor, think again. Noel Gallagher himself in an interview disowns Morning Glory, Be Here Now and Standing on the Shoulders of Giants. Fact.

B000066NW0|4.0|I finally got the cd and I think it's a great cd.  I love how she claimed to be punk but this cd is NOT punk.  Pop with a punk/rock twist?  Oh yea, and it sounds awesome.  A must have for any music fan, there is such a wide variety of songs that it's a great cd to blast at a party.  Go buy it, it's worth every cent! My personal fav track is #5..... Avril rocks!

0553565915|4.0|Betty J. Eadie's NDE has similarities common to such experiences, such as the black &quot;tunnel&quot; and a light at the end of the tunnel, beings of white light, etc.  One interesting thing is that Betty didn't meet any deceased relatives on the other side, which is very common with other people.  Instead she met a being she thinks was Jesus.  Unfortunately, Betty doesn't elaborate why she believed this being was Jesus.  She never described how he looked, etc.  There are several other parts in the book like this that makes you say &quot;huh?&quot;  Betty had interesting views on the afterlife and actions of the angels and spirits.  Supposedly we come to earth to learn how to be better spirits, even helping one another with assigned &quot;missions.&quot;  Her ideas/experiences are very similar to what the famous medium John Edward mentions (&quot;Crossing Over&quot;).  She does mention here and there about bad spirits, but doesn't elaborate on their role on earth.  She often refers to the Biblical text in this book, so it takes a Christian view of the afterlife.  Interestingly, a lot of the experiences she mentions can be considered Buddhists ideas too, such as rebirth.  One interesting personal note to mention.  Betty mentioned she was shown people working on looms to make gowns for the new arrivals.  These where white gowns that had a &quot;see through&quot; property.  When I was young, I had a negative experience where I saw a female ghost, which was indeed wearing a see through white gown.  I thought that was pretty interesting and maybe a confirmation of her experiences.  So in my opinion, Betty did have a NDE and recalls it as best she can, albeit with a Christian slant.  Overall, this was a very enjoyable book, but sometimes leaves you wondering why she says the things she says.
6305949980|5.0|Being a slightly strange child all my life at the age of seven or eight I had a real love for things that badly scared others of my age, and likewise, was badly scared by things that others of my age enjoyed. I was truly enchanted at my early age by this movie, quickly developing a love for a slightly psychotic, insanely fun film, one made with true imagination and artistic talent. It was, really, my absolute favourite film until I was about ten--I remember being upstairs, in one of my grandma's spare rooms in her hundreds of years old victorian house, watching The Nightmare Before Christmas in the dead of night. As I got older, I didn't see it again for years. That is, not until this last Halloween. <BR> My very delightful friend (as fun and crazy as I am when it comes to anything out of the ordinary) recommended it back to me and I was excited to see it again, remembering how much I loved it when I was little. <BR> It was every ounce to my delight, remembering myself years before, hearing this Hard-not-to-sing-with soundtrack and the wonderful characters again after so many years. <BR> The story begins as Jack, the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town in a land of holidays, is growing tired of 'the same old thing.' He longs for something new besides the screams of the terrified children heard so often at Halloween and the witches, vampires and ghoulish creatures that live in their land. Sally, a stitched girl created by the resident Doctor (Who occasionally open his helmet-like head and gives his grey-pink, wrinkled brain a scratch and transports himself in a self-moving wheelchair), has a hopeless crush upon the greatly adored Jack, and she often tries to escape the clutches of the repressive doctor, who doesn't let her out often. As sad Sally escapes to the cemetary, she find Jack, singing out his laments and sad with the regularity of his life. As forlorn, depressed Jack stumbles through the forest through the night, accompanied by his ghost dog Zero, he reaches strange ring of trees--each with a different symbol upon it with a doorknob. This one a easter egg, this one with a shamrock, this one with a turkey--another with a strange, decorated tree. Entranced, Jack opens the door and falls into the land of Christmas Town, where he declares--&quot;What's this, what's this? There's white things in the air. What's this, there's colours everywhere. What's this? I can't believe my eyes, wake up Jack, this isn't fair! What's this?&quot; Totally delighted by Christmas, Jack is convinced it will fill the empty hole he has felt inside, and, convinced Halloween Town will be just as excited, takes many items back with him to explain Christmas and the mysterious 'Sandy Claws'. What begins is Jack's plan to take over Santa's Christmas job, and hiring The Oogie-Boogey man's three hench-children, the top Trick-or-Treaters of Halloween town, Lock, Shock and Barrel, who kidnap Santa, and makes terrifying toys and a sleigh with a coffin drawn by skeleton reindeer. <BR> A delgihtful, different movie experience, Tim Burton's characters are easy to get attached to and though mischevious and creepy, have a loveable quality that is contagious. I'm truly excited to purchase a movie that has been one of my favourites ever since I was a child, and can't wait to watch it again. A truly orignial, singing, chilling but cheerful film that is as timeless as any other, it's a must-see treat! And though it's slightly depressing for the Christmas holiday, it's an absolute must for Halloween.
B00006CXXU|2.0|She's not a girl, but she's definitely a woman. Christina (Xtina?) Aguliera wants to get the message across that she's miles away from her Mickey Mouse Club days. She proclaims that loudly on her first English-language, non-holiday album in three years: \\"Stripped.\\" While much of the material here isn't terrible, one gets the feeling that Christina is trying too hard to assert her maturity on this record. She ropes in rappers Lil' Kim and Redman; she wears outfits that would make even Playboy bunnies blush, and she sings about \\"getting just a little naughty\\" in the ultrasleazy \\"Dirrty\\" (two r's, please). Yet, \\"Stripped\\" comes up short, which is a shame since Christina is an exceptionally gifted singer. She cuts loose in the shockingly soulful ballad \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" and makes a good impression on the steamy r&b jam \\"Get Mine, Get Yours.\\" And she holds up well through the angry lyrics of the breakup stomper \\"Fighter.\\" But the rest of the album isn't very memorable. The extremely overrated Alicia Keyes hops on for the perfectly forgettable \\"Impossible\\" (which she also wrote). And Linda Perry from the 1990s one-hit-wonder Four Non Blondes serves up a lukewarm platter of the same-old pop rock that made Pink's album a bland affair. To her credit, Aguliera has somewhat made the transition to adulthood, but much of the material on this overlong 78-minute disc failed to register with me. While \\"Stripped\\" isn't a bust, it won't be getting much rotation on my CD player.
0375414053|1.0|How sad that so many of the reviewers feel that this book represents their life.  While Kate Reddy likes to talk about how much she loves her kids, she avoids them whenever she can, and is mean to them when she is with them.  And she says she loves her job, but you never see that in the book, either.  The characters in the book are all very two-dimensional; I didn't care a thing about any of them.  As a working mother myself, I have very little time to read.  I'm sorry I wasted some of that time on this book.
0316666343|4.0|I must admit that when I first heard about this book on National Public Radio and heard that it was about the murder of a 14 year old girl I was taken aback.  Then they went on to describe the rest of the book and my interest peaked.  I found myself perusing a copy of the book at a local bookstore and bought it.  It was one of those books that you just cannot put down.  This book tells the story of a young girl who was indeed murdered by one of her neighbors.  The gruesome murder happens in chapter one and then we hear only the girls thoughts from, of all places, her heaven.  The story then goes on to be her description of the lives of her mother, father, sister, boyfriend and her murderer.  This is the story of how tragedy affects the family and friends of the deceased.  Well worth the time to read, I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  I love books that you can't put down once you start reading and this book fits that bill perfectly.
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's amazing how much one person can grow in a period of 3 years. This album is simply amazing considering the one preceding it. Everything here is wonderful and serves a purpose, nothing seems filler, mundane, or boring. Christina's voice is amazing as well. Christina helped write all but two of the songs (&quot;Beautiful&quot; and &quot;Impossible&quot;) yet no one song reigns &quot;supreme&quot; on the album. Pick up this album if you're a fan of Christina and pick up this album if you're a fan of music in general. The CD is almost a plethora of musical style. Rock, Pop, R&amp;B, Jazz, Funk. It's all here and it's all good. Stand out tracks : &quot;Fighter,&quot; &quot;Loving Me 4 Me,&quot; &quot;Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Cruz,&quot; &quot;Soar,&quot; and &quot;I'm OK.&quot;<br />Do yourself a favor and pick this album up. It's simply amazing.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Originally dubbed the 'Slow Motion Picture' by even die hard Trekkies, the first Star Trek movie was a ponderous, plodding and protracted affair rushed into cinemas as a post-Star Wars special effects showcase. The plot was made even worse by the 1983 re-edit, which added 11 minutes to it's already interminable running time. Now director Robert Wise has re-edited the film, tightening the pace, re-inserted key scenes, enhancing effects and supervising a Dolby 5.1 sound mix. And the result? Well, it's still ponderous, plodding and only slightly less protracted. But there are good points though; the principal actors, (Especially William Shatner) are good in their roles, and Jerry Goldsmith's fantastic memorable score helps events, but it's still a so-so movie, that would thankfully be redeemed by the excellent Star Trek II. Not trying to push the point too far, but I fell asleep the first time I watched this lacklustre entry into the Star Trek cannon. The extra material on the DVD bumps up the rating though, with 3 retrospective documentaries with cast and crew interviews, trailers, 8 television commercials, 11 deleted scenes and additional scenes. Also included are storyboard archives and a new Star Trek series Enterprise promo spot.<br />Impressive extras but it's for hard-core Star Trek fans only.
0375414053|5.0|I am only half way through and cursed every trick or treater last night that interrupted my reading.  <BR>The piousness of the Mother Superiors is just like that of the home-all-day moms in my neighborhood who don't include me or my kids in things because my schedule and love of my job makes me a bad mom (and my inability to be available at 2:00 in the afternoon for coffee or shopping doesn't help).  I have pulled that same baking trick with the confectioners sugar!!<br />Unlike Kate, I do not take my sainted spouse for granted at all.<br />Loved the comment that money doesn't know sex!<br />Recommended for moms who work out of the home as well as in, and especially those who have big responsibilities on the job.
B000067CPX|4.0|When a band has released a lot of records, and you wonder if the new one is up to snuff, here's the litmus test:  pretend it was the first release of a new group.  How does this album stand up?  It's the best thing out there now.  Let's not worry about what genre it's in -- is there anybody else out there composing, arranging, playing and producing their music with such raw conviction, with such true artistic soul?  No.<br />On the quibble side, there are some lesser songs, and with the possible exception of the title track, the songs look more to the past than the future.<br />But let's credit the band for pushing their own boundaries.  Hopefully, you're not doing the same things with your life you were doing 10 or 20 years ago, so don't wish such a fate on the people we turn to for creative inspiration.
0316666343|4.0|This book is beautifully written. It's truly worth reading and I would recommend this to everyone.
B00005UEAR|5.0|I heard and read it all before. Dream Theater has no soul. They're too smart, the singer sings too high, they play too many notes, they're too flashy and showy. I say \\"Praise God!\\" I love this band, they paint musical pictures that nobody else can or would want to, and that is where their value lies. Think about in a basketball metaphor. Shooting hoops is fun, but do you want to pay money to see rather ordinary people shoot hoops? No thanks here. If I am going to pay money, I want to see Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant amaze me with their basketball pyrotechnics. The popular bands today are just rather ordinary guys shooting hoops. Dream Theater are 5 Michael Jordans doing their thing, and they are utterly amazing. <br />This new album is phenomenal from start to finish. \\"The Glass Prison\\" and \\"Misunderstood\\" are two wonderful highlights, easily ranking towards the top of Dream Theater's catalog. \\"The Glass Prison,\\" clocking in at over 13 minutes, seems like 5 after you get into and through it. The epic title track has some jaw-dropping moments, but does lag in places: \\"Goodnight Kiss\\" in particular features some great piano, but just seems out of place. But the album still is incredible and if listened to critically and perceptively, will lead you to an altered state.
B000003S09|5.0|I don't think this album is overrated because nothing is overrated - it's all subjective, you see. Still, I enjoy every King Crimson album after this quite a bit more. Yet, I still consider this an amazing record. You can infer from this opinion that I am weird or that King Crimson is so good that even their weakest album (in my mind) is still essential.<br />Embracing rock and jazz and classical, King Crimson's debut is rightly considered groundbreaking and arguably the most notable album in the genesis of progressive rock. While the proto-prog artists like Procol Harum and The Moody Blues (whose _Days of Future Passed_ was feasibly the first prog rock album, really), were influential as well, _In the Court of the Crimson King_ was more overpowering and momentous. Why? I'd say the first song, &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, likely left a big impression, blowing the mind of everyone who heard it. An explosive marriage of bombastic rock and fiery jazz, with a middle section of searing tempos and rhythmic virtuosity -- drummer Michael Giles' precision and power stand out while Greg Lake (on bass) hammers out his most intense performance ever. The overlaying horns keep a quirky flavor intact (amusing, as the lyrics are quite bleak). Robert Fripp's solo is aggressive and spits off a diatonic scale with a hectic texturizing quality. In the end, it all collapses into a noisy mire that seems in sync with the song's overall theme.<br />The rest of the album is quite a bit less overtly exciting, although it's still good. &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; is a plaintive, wistful ballad that is a showcase for Ian McDonald's folk influence -- his flute playing is enchanting and the whole song accents the group's versatility (after all, this comes after the crazy opening track). &quot;Moonchild&quot; is an idyllic soundscape -- there is a bit of a song at the beginning but mostly all the length comes from 10 minutes of catatonic jamming. As far as sleepy improvisation goes, this is okay I think -- it borders on delicate intensity at times and the ending is quite pretty. &quot;Epitaph&quot; is an epic ballad burdened by some omnipresent mellotron chords (to simulate a backing string section) which feel somewhat detached, but the singing is some of Lake's finest (ever) and quite stirring. The title track is a moody epic -- ominous and powerful and evocative -- but the soupy mellotron never really lifts the song to the heights that may have been originally visualized. In any case, by the time the main theme rolls around for one final time, you may feel the hairs on the back of your neck rising like me.<br />In review of this...review, I feel it is a bit captious. Just so there is no ambiguity in my opinion I should be a little more explicit. Though the album is dated in some respects, I don't necessarily think that it much diminishes the feeling of King Crimson's fabulous debut. It's still a unique listening experience, and I think it holds up better than other albums from the era. Unless you live in a tent by the river and eat dandelions for dinner, you're crazy not to own this -- assuming you are a prog rock fan. And you likely are, to some extent...why else are you reading this?this is okay I think -- it borders on delicate intensity at times and the ending is quite pretty. &quot;Epitaph&quot; is an epic ballad burdened by some omnipresent mellotron chords (to simulate a backing string section) which feel somewhat detached, but the singing is some of Lake's finest (ever) and quite stirring.

0811828697|5.0|The artwork on this book is excellent. The drawings of the various Star Wars animals are detailed and lifelike. The creatures are drawn in a dynamic fashion making them almost jump off the page. A must have for any Star Wars fan.
0446605409|5.0|I Don't know what the other reviewers were reading, to think that this book was slow and unfunny. These are probably the people who laugh at puns and riddles on P.B.S. I don't know how to make it more clear, I loved Plum Island, especially the lead character John Corey he made me laugh out loud (haha) funny dialogue.<br />This is my first Demille novel and I loved his writing style. Demille is very good all around, his characters are well developed, his mystery is well structured, the action is great, and his rap up is fun fun fun.<br />I quickly ran out and purchased \\"The Lion's Game\\" just because John Corey is featured in it. I love this Guy.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This cd adds to the small list of masterful works recently released such as radiohead's amnesiac, wilco's YHF, and some recent bowie.  No radio singles here.  so what.  If you liked mutations, this cd takes that style to another level. infectious. <br />Watching the musical evolution of this artist has been wonderful.  If you listen closely, you'll hear the same roots guitar sentiment that he showed on one foot in the grave, although the production is way more advanced.<br />thank you beck.
B00004U8PA|5.0|\\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" is one of the best cult classics of it's time.<br />Originally this movie started out at a play over in Europe staring a small cast of characters and a very dedicated audience..  Then one day the play director (you will see him as rif raff) decided that he wanted to pass this truelly magnificient gift on to others.. Thus was born \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\"..  When it first came out it bombed badly.. So Bad that it was taken out of the theatres faster then it was placed in them..<br />Then one night a group of people went to a theatre manager and asked that Rocky be played at midnight.. and WHAM!!  The craze was born.. and the shows went on..,.<br />What is all the excitement you ask?  Simple.. this movie is a fun spoof on all those olde sci-fi movies that featured outerspace creatures, sex, and strange going on's.. With the excitment of a full broadway musical with such songs as \\"Dammit Janet\\", \\"Time Warp\\", \\"Sweet Transvestite\\" and many many many more songs that lend to the whole ambience of the film..<br />The acting is not the best but, is carried of quite well by Tim Curry (Dr. Frank-N-Furter), and Susan Sherandon (Janet)..<br />And if you are trying to find the best version of the film to get make sure you get the ones that feature the deleted scenes and the alternate endings.. You will wonder why they ever took them out..
0312265859|3.0|I always look forward to the latest Stephanie Plum novel.  While Janet Evanovich's plots are neither as complex as those by Elizabeth George or Martha Grimes nor are the novels as well-written, I'm always entertained.  However, this time I was disappointed.<br />Although the plot was darker than usual and dealt with parental child kidnapping, I found the story to be somewhat plodding and the resolution unsatisfying, almost as if the author realized it was time to wrap it up, but didn't have a good idea of how to do it.  There was good tension created a very scary bad guy, Eddie Abruzzi, who is somehow involved with the abduction, and is stalking Stephanie because he believes she knows more about the mother's whereabouts than she really does.  Stephanie's on-again, off-again boyfriend/fiance and cop, Joe Morelli, makes infrequent appearances, which is a bit odd given the very real danger Stephanie faces from Abruzzi.  The only sexual tension is provided by Ranger, her mysterious mentor, with whom she has an unpaid \\"debt\\" that she dreads paying off.  Rather than seeing more of her eccentric and always entertaining Grandma Mazur, we're stuck with the antics of \\"perfect\\" sister Valerie, who has moved with her children back home after leaving her husband, and a clown-ish attorney named Kloughn, who is just plain annoying.<br />I don't blame Ms. Evanovich for wanting to add new life to a somewhat formulaic but always humourous series, but for me it just didn't work as well as it could have.
6304698526|4.0|This tough police drama about protecting a witness in San Francisco was a star vehicle for Steve McQueen and contains one of the best car chases on film, a fine advertisement for the (real, i.e. 1960s) Ford Mustang (California yellow-on-black license JJZ 109).  The chase in _The French Connection_ (1971) was a conscious derivative of it employing some of the same talent.  (Written 1999)
0739301721|5.0|I am going to be so disappointed when this story ends.  This is a fabulous book by a brilliant new writer.  I just logged on to <BR>Amazon to buy every book that this woman has written and was shocked to find that this is her first.  Also, I listened to this book on cd and the reader Emma Fielding is great.  I'm always so relieved when a professional is hired to read.  Some great books are delivered very poorly when read by the author.
0316666343|4.0|... The first chapter begins with an agonizingly disturbing account of the fourteen-year old Susie Salmon who was brutally raped and murdered by schzoid neighbor Mr. Harvey and later proceeds on to telling how her family has disintegrated with the impact of the murder. Her father suffers a depression from pursuing her daughter's death; her mother retreats and ends up having an affair; her tragic siblings Lindsey struggles with her loss and Buckley gripping with filling the hole in the family.<br />Yet familial hell isn't what makes The Lovely Bones sensational. It is Sebold's child-like narration that renders the book poignant with lost innocence and her mastery at revitalizing the readers' senses with vivid descriptions of smell and Heaven. She uses objects like a monopoly game and bottleships to tacitly echo out the character's interplay of emotions - and expressing effectively their grief. The family matures and connects like the bones, becoming stronger and gives us a renewed sense of faith and understanding as to why each family member errs. I empathize with Abigail's merciful adultery and how Jack has overlooked his daughter Lindsey in his frantic search for Susie.  <br />What's a little sentimentalism when the book is emotionally honest? A good book rewards a reader with insight and experience - and The Lovely Bones achingly underscores the importance of letting go one's grief to focus on the better things of life. This message cannot be more timely or resonant in this era of chaos.
B00005OAIE|5.0|If you liked Michael Penn's debute album, you'll like this one - though there is a little bit of jazz influence. I spotted a likeness to Penn on some cuts, CSNY on others and a fair amount of jazz (Neon) a la Go West (see '80's). There wasn't a cut that dissapointed me on this CD. Everyone that hears it in my car also agrees.<br />Pay no attention to the critics. ...
B00000ICN5|4.0|No doubt about it. If you want to get into SRV, this is the place to start. This 1983 debut showed the energy and the tight sound of the young, white-boy blues musicians that were scattered here and there. Sadly, it would all come to an end for SRV in 1990 and the torch would have to be carried by others including Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Unlike most other SRV albums, there are no really long tracks here; just concise, compact toe-tappers, standard blues wailers, and wistful ballads.<br />&quot;Love Struck Baby&quot; seems to be an SRV fan favorite and is a perfect song to begin the album. Both &quot;Pride and Joy&quot; and the title song are old school blues. &quot;Rude Mood&quot; skips along and is simply impossible to dislike, as is the case with &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot;. &quot;Dirty Pool&quot; is one of the slower songs and may be one of the weaker. Still, it's not bad. The best song may be the melancholy &quot;Lenny&quot; and it seems to be a shorter version (in some ways) of the musical masterpiece &quot;Riviera Paradise&quot; from the In Step album.<br />If you own no albums from Stevie Ray Vaughn, start here and move quickly up the line. The second album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, is even better than this one. The best thing to remember though, is that there is no such thing(IMO)as a bad SRV album.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This album was probably my best impulse buy of the year.  Queens have a totaly unique sound that is realy refeshing in a time of sound alike bands who just keep riping off each other sounds rather than create something unique.
B000066NW0|5.0|i love the cd it makes me feel alive, it is so cool
B00000J7A2|5.0|I have never heard Lick My Decals Off Baby, but of the Beefheart I have heard, this is my very favorite album. Trout Mask Replica continues to get all the press but there is quite a bit of stuff on Trout that I don't like. The stuff on Trout that I love, I totally love, but overall I feel the remastered and bonus-tracked Safe As Milk is a much better disc as a whole.<br />  The moods are varied and interesting. Electricity is proto-punk that could easily double as the soundtrack to a Western. Plastic Factory has always made me think of Pigpen of the Grateful Dead doing Big Boss Man, except I like it. The Captain has a much better vocal delivery and is a far superior harmonica player to Pigpen. Plus Plastic Factory is just an infinitely better song. Zig Zag Wanderer has a thick, heavy bassline and great bass tone all around. Trust Us could segue perfectly into Black Sabbath's Iron Man and blow the roof off of any concert venue.<br />  Beefheart and The Magic Band just had a way with rhythm and melody that knocks me out. A couple times during this cd there are quiet guitar riffs that always make Vietnam-type scenes flash through my head.... as if we're listening to the unused soundtrack for a Vietnam battle movie.<br />Actually there are good things I could say about almost every track on this cd but rather than do that, I'll just say that I will never understand why Safe As Milk isn't widely hailed as one of the all-time great rock albums.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I am sure all of Christina's fans will agree that this new album is very different than the first album.  Christina's new album includes a little bit of rock, latin, soul and hip hop.  My favorite track on this album is \\"Impossible,\\" written and composed by Alicia Keys.  Christina shows her soulful side and she sounds GREAT! If I had my choice, I would enjoy hearing Christina sing more soul.  However, as a true fan, I stand behind her and support her many different talents in music.
B00005JL2O|5.0|As a major fan of Austin Powers I was dying to see the third part. It was for sure the best cinema experiece I have ever had in my life. I laughed so hard that tears were literally pouring out of my eyes. After the movie I was physically exhausted from laughing. I absolutely recommend it... but it is definately better when you watch the first two parts as many times as possible. The dvd also has excellent deleted scenes! Mike Myres is brilliant! Definately the best comedy movie ever...
B00006NSZ5|4.0|...when I heard \\"Lose Yourself\\" I was hypnotised. I have never heard more powerful lyrics in my life. More importantly, I felt that the song had a POSITIVE message which is rare for Eminem. Anyway since this soundtrack is the only place to get it, i would highly recommend this soundtrack. As for the other tracks they are very good.... BUY IT!
6302250269|5.0|Perhaps I am a bit behind the times, but I recently viewed 'Thelma and Louise' for the first time.  At first I was skeptical that the movie would live up to all the positive stories I heard about it years ago when it was released.  After watching the entire movie I am happy to admit that I was wrong to be so pessimistic.<br />'Thelma and Louise' is a brilliant look at the way our lives are affected by the decisions we make and it offers an insightful glimpse into the way many women think.  Although I cannot relate totally to either of these women, virtually every woman I know has personality attributes similar to these characters.  Their accidental adventures and traumatic experiences portray a magnificent connection between cause and effect.<br />True friendship is what holds this entire movie together and it is easy to see why both these women were nominated for Academy Awards.  I may have been skeptical at first, but I found myself rooting for these women and considering what I would do in similar situations.  While I cannot imagine ever going to such extremes, this movie presents a valuable lesson in learning how to cope with the problems life throws your way.
0962477060|5.0|I've been playing for 15 years.  Thats a long time to not really know anything about my instrument. Well, the Major and natural minor scales, pentatonics, and a few positional arpeggios, but its sad how little I know about the Fretboard.<BR>Enter this book.  It takes the guitar, sectiosn it off in bite-sized chunks and then reassembles the whole thing into a tastier morsel.  It views things in terms of 5 movable chords.  There are scales and arpeggios associated with these scales.  Learn them.  Then it tells shows you how they are connected.<BR>This is not a lesson book.  It just gives you some patterns and suggeswted fingerings for the major scale, its modes, harmonic minor, melodic minor, chords and arpeggios.  Its good if you feel like you were weak in this department and it opened up doors for me again.<BR>I'm very glad I got it.
B00005KA9G|5.0|Several out-of-work men in the decaying town of Sheffield, England envision a scheme to earn money and the adoration of a town full of women...and thus begins the delightful story of 'The Full Monty.'  <br />I approached this movie with no expectations and found an incredibly funny and realistic look at hard times in a struggling town.  With jobs difficult to find and the town's women being lured to view the oiled bodies of Chippendale dancers, these friends take matters into their own hands in an attempt to reclaim the pride that was vanquished when they found themselves unemployed.  While their ultimate plan may be a strange way to take pride in themselves, these men pull it off quite humorously.<br />Aside from the general plot, this movie also gives us a glimpse of how families deal with hard times (including unemployment and divorce).  I found myself interested in not only the fantastic scheme of the men, but also in the dynamics of how these families would ultimately succeed.  All in all, I was quite impressed with the movie and enjoy watching it anytime I need a good laugh.  This movie may not make anyone's Top Ten list, but it is definitely effective when the desired result is a hearty bit of laughter.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has returned more powerful than ever with this fantastic album. This album goes so much deeper than the first single &quot;Dirrty&quot;, beyond the hot and heavy grinding of that song, the others have a mature view on life. Christina's ability to use her voice with so many different styles of music is amazing to me. Soul, R&amp;B, Rock, and Pop are all included on this record. There have been so many artist that have tried to master this technique and failed. But It's Christina's heavenly voice that lets her accomplish this nearly impossible task. &quot;Beautiful&quot; in particular is a song that not only shows her extrodinary range, but has an great message too. &quot;Impossible&quot; is a song full of heart and soul, while &quot;I'm Ok&quot; is a deep look into her painful past. This has been the first record  where I've listened every song without stopping or skipping tracks in years. Christina has really out done herself this time, and has proven that she truly is the best singer out.
B000001Y42|5.0|Oh my god! This is the most amazing heavy metal album ever! So brutal, and yet so technical! Wes Borland is the most amazing guitarist I've ever heard. His solos are so fast and complex, he makes Yngwie and Eddie Van Halen look bad. Sam River's bass playing puts Les Claypool to shame, and John Otto? Oh man. Move over Neil Peart, there's a new drum king in town! Fred Durst is a god! His lyrics and vocals are just so powerful. Geoff Tate only wishes he could sing and write like this guy. Forget Iron Maiden. Limp Bizkit ruuuules!
B00006CXXU|4.0|\\"Stripped,\\" finally.  Now if only she would get a new stylist and ditch the nose ring. Christina Aguilera finally focuses on the music and her incredible voice. I like this album because of a few key jazz and r&b inspired tracks, noteably \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Impossible.\\" The latter composed by Alicia Keys.  Brilliant use of vocal talent with fresh and exciting beats, a must-have for any music enthusiast.  While her new in-your-face image is a departure from the Pop Star previously seen in \\"Genie in a Bottle,\\" as well as \\"What a Girl Wants,\\" the Christina here is notably more agressive and musically inspired.  Not for the timid.  Bravo Ms. Aguilera.  I really want her to release an album of jazz-standards to focus on her INCREDIBLE voice, but this'll do for now.
B00005JLXO|5.0|This is a very powerful movie, It is remarkably unbiased and presents the facts as known. The confusion of a plan gone awry is clearly presented in a manner that makes you feel a part of the drama. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and thought the acting excellent and appropriately subdued.
0688170528|5.0|Absolutely masterfull.  Moving, compelling, and thought-provoking.  This ought to be read in high schools across the country as teen suicide becomes an increasingly, and more frighteningly realistic epidemic which must given our nation's attention.  As a survivor of the suicide of a close teenage friend, I wish this novel, and the appropriate addition materials would find a place in the classrooms of schools today!!
B00005N9CV|5.0|Those who do not know Diana Krall's music but have happened onto this album for whatever reason are in for a treat.  And please be advised, you decidedly do not have to be a jazz enthusiast to enjoy and appreciate \\"The Look of Love,\\" on which the inimitable Krall reinvents such standards as \\"S'Wonderful,\\" \\"I Remember You\\" and \\"Cry Me A River,\\" among others.  <br />Krall is something of an anomaly in her field; acoustic-oriented jazz musicians do not generally have albums that go platinum and gold, nor do most have the kind of following that sells out the larger auditoriums and venues night after night, as she did in Paris in November/December, 2001, during her four shows at the Olympia.  She's played the Lilith Fair and topped the billboard charts twice, the first time in 2000 with her album, \\"When I Look In Your Eyes,\\" (which also landed her a Grammy nomination for Best Album of the Year, putting her in competition with such diverse artists as Santana, The Backstreet Boys, TLC and The Dixie Chicks), and most recently with this unforgettable collection.<br />By the time you've listened to this album for the first time, you'll understand how Krall has made such an impact on the music scene during the past ten years.  The pianist/vocalist has an earthy quality in her sultry, magnificent voice that will keep you in thrall song after song, with the kind of music that seems to fill you up inside.  The influence of artists who have preceded her are apparent in her style, most notably Carmen McRae, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughn and even Joni Mitchell and Sting, and yet her sound is her own; without question, Diana Krall is unique-- jazz's top selling vocalist, a crossover phenom who has remained faithful to her bop/swing roots, successfully incorporating the kind of music she loves into the musical impressions that have taken her to the top of the charts and generated a solid and ever-increasing base of loyal fans.  <br />This is the kind of music that transcends generations or category; the kind that sooner or later will entice even the die-hard heavy metal/rap crowd, because this is music that will stop you in your tracks and tie up traffic.  For a real experience, kick back in the dark, put on \\"The Look of Love\\" and just listen.  It's transporting; and once you emerge from Krall's spell, you'll find that your world will forever be a bit sweeter.  And a whole lot brighter.
B00006V9A0|4.0|When i first heard that the two remaining members of Nirvana were due to release an album that comprises all their greatest hits and a brand new unreleased single i was jumping for joy. This album includes most of Nirvana's greatest hits and the new single. However staying true to the rules of greatest hits albums key tracks have been cruelly left out, like their first single 'love buzz', The strangly chilling 'polly' and the ultra catchy 'Breed'. the tracks that have been included however are the best from the group, from the heart renching 'All Apologies' to the smash hit 'Smells like teen spirit' to the brand new 'You know your right'. I would have given this album 5 stars but key tracks been missed out, it just misses the extra star.<BR>Now, in my opinion too many tracks from their debut (and best) album 'Bleach' have been left out which only 'About a girl' has been included. below is what i think of each track:<br />1.You know your right - great intro, go's from loud and fast to slow and quiet very quickly. 4/5<BR>2.About a girl - Regarded as one of Nirvanas best tracks, taken from Bleach 4.5/5<BR>3.Been a son - A catcy tune to it, about a girl who should have been a son. 3/5<BR>4.Sliver - Brought out in 1990 (Nirvanas only release that year) as a stop gap between albums, very catchy chorus and great songwriting, although a little short. 5/5<BR>5.Smells like teen spirit - Nirvana's most well known track, and its easy to see why, just listen to it! 5/5<BR>6.Come as you are - From the bands most commercial album (Nevermind) very good tune, in which Kurt pours his heart out 5/5<BR>7.Lithium - Another song in which Kurt moans, and also another smash hit, the song Dave Grohl expected to be the hit. 5/5<BR>8.In Bloom - Another very catchy tune, but in my opinion doesnt live up to the rest of Nevermind 3.5/5<BR>9.Heart shaped box - From the bands last album, In Utero this song is rumoured to be about Courtney Love. 4/5<BR>10.Pennyroyal tea - To me this song seems a little average, but for Nirvana that is still good, great sdongwriting though. 3/5<BR>11.Rape Me - Didnt really stand out as a hit for me, but its still a good song. 3/5<BR>12.Dumb - Another one that didnt stand out for me, but still good nontheless, however probably the worst on the album. 3/5<BR>13.All apologies - My favourate Nirvana song, heart wrenching, awesome. 5/5<BR>14.The man who sold the world - Another very good song, Kurts singing is fantastic. 4/5<br />RIP Kurt cobain and thankyou<BR>20 February 1967 - 5 April 1994
B00005JKNF|5.0|After seeing Gosford Park in a theater, I commented that I looked forward to seeing it in DVD, to have subtitles, to be able to figure out everything that was going on.  Well... a friend and I have now seen it a total of 4 times together, including two DVD commentaries (with subtitles...) and guess what?  We *still* haven't figured out all the interwoven plots!  And that's OK, as it turns out.  The movie is an attempt to give you the experience of attending a shooting party at a British country house in as authentic a way as possible, which means that, yes, it's not really important to &quot;get&quot; everything that's going on, just as you wouldn't have understood everything if you had been there!  Brilliant performances by a cast of outstanding actors.  And the Ivor Novello songs are more delightful with every hearing.
0316666343|4.0|What a pleasant surprise!  Although outwardly the topic is very dark, the author's narration and story telling really eliminate all the darkness from the topic.  I have a teenage daughter and found her reaction to how her family was doing was very realistic!  Great book, wonderful description of heaven and the grief process.  Highly recommend this book!
B00006LLNU|2.0|I'm giving this album a low rating because of the nasty surpise I discovered on this disc.  While the music is as excelent as always the disc I purchased has a special copy prevention feature that prevents it from bring played on a computer.  If you intend to listen to this on a stereo system, then by all means buy it and enjoy. If however, you plan to listen to this on a computer (for whatever reason), save your money and don't buy it.  It won't play at all on a MAC and the sound quality in Windows is at such a reduced level that it sounds worse than some 15 year old analog tapes I have.
0553583182|5.0|I started out looking for ways to improve my memory and overcome some of my thoughts of fear of failure.  I've listened to people in person explain to me the part of setting goals to succeed in life.  These goals that I had set for myself were never achieved, and I had  set it in my mind that I was not to be of those people who succeed and have great abundance of all things in their lives.  This book explained how I had set myself up for failure just by thinking about failure is going to happen.  I had to sit back and reflect on my past activities and thoughts.  I remembered the many times I said \\"I can't ....\\", \\"I have no money...\\".  I have fifty four years of bad habits to overcome, I thought to myself. It really put a crimp in the works. I had to do some plumbing in my house, you know cut and solder all the piping. I was thinking of getting a plumber, but I thought I can't afford it. I was afraid of doing it myself in case of 'screwing it all up'. I was really feeling depressed about this, thinking about how am I going to get this plumbing work done.  I read the book a second time, only this time I did the exercises.  It was hard at first, my attention span wandered. But by being consistent and just thinking in my mind the picture of me cutting and soldering all the copper pipe I had it in my mind that I was confident of doing this with no problems.  I already had all the supplies bought, so after 2 weeks of plumbing pictures flowing through my mind, one morning after getting up I just went ahead and did the plumbing, without thinking of what would happen, or wondering if their would be leaks.  I just had it in my mind that eveything would be ok. I had no fear. After it was all done, and I turned the water main back on----everything was ok. The thoughts of fear seem to disconnect a person from the abundance of life around them.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I'm a fan of both BtVS and Xena and I have to say that this musical episode far outshines the Xena musical episode.  Why?  For one thing, each actor sang their own songs and didn't lip synch and that adds a lot.  Secondly, \\"Once More With Feeling\\" seemed more like a musical, stylistically speaking, whereas the Xena episode was more like an opera.  Depends on what you like, this is just my opinion.<br />Ok, now to the CD.  Many have said it and I'll agree that Amber Benson's \\"Under Your Spell\\" was a standout.  Ms. Benson revealed in an interview that the song was actually not in her register and she had to sing it at a higher pitch than what she normally does.  Geez, if that was not in her normal register, I'd love to hear her sing a song in her comfort range!  You get a hint of the strength of her voice in the \\"Under Your Spell/Standing Reprise.\\"  Bravo, Ms. Benson!  Other wonderful performances were of course Anthony Head's \\"Standing\\" solo and any song where his voice is featured.  His voice is so velvety and clear - a real pleasure to listen to.  I understand he played Dr. Frank'n Furter in \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" on stage - he probably blew the songs out of the water like he does here.<br />James Marsters (who I think has a band in \\"real-life\\") was just great on \\"Rest In Peace,\\" a gothic-rock piece.  Well done, Mr. Marsters!  As others have said, Sarah Michelle Gellar did a remarkable job when you consider that she's really not a singer.  Her songs, \\"Going Through The Motions,\\" \\"Walk Through The Fire,\\" and \\"Something To Sing About,\\" were quite acceptable for a non-singer but just ok for a singer.  Considering that she is not a singer, Ms. Gellar did quite a fine job.  The rest of the CD features a duet, \\"I'll Never Tell,\\" which is OK musically but very amusing and important to the story of Xander and Anya's relationship.  The big group numbers, \\"I've Got A Theory,\\" \\"Walk Through The Fire\\" and \\"Where Do We Go From Here\\" were the most musical-like. I thought the voices blended well, i.e. strong voices like Anthony Head and Amber Benson did not dominate, which is always a good thing in group numbers.<br />I gave this 5 stars because for what it is, it's excellent.  The singing is not Broadway production quality (with notable exceptions already discussed), but it's definitely sincere and heartfelt.  Any BtVS fan, casual or die-hard will love this.  If you don't watch the show you might not get a lot of it and you might not be as forgiving of the cast's singing as the fans.  That said, it's a great piece of TV history to own and enjoy.  Go ahead, buy it and soon you'll be under the spell of all the catchy tunes.ought the voices blended well, i.e. strong voices like Anthony Head and Amber Benson did not dominate, which is always a good thing in group numbers.<br />I gave this 5 stars because for what it is, it's excellent.

B000001FS6|3.0|In the transitional album \\"The Unforgettable Fire,\\" released in 1995, Irish rockers U2 showed a growing fascination with America that would ultimately lead to the monumental \\"Joshua Tree,\\" a record as stark and beautiful as a desert road in the Southwest. Unfortunately, lead singer Bono's arrogance was growing during this period, too, and it peaked with the double-live/studio album \\"Rattle and Hum,\\" a sprawling record that showcases U2's interest in the U.S., but ultimately falls short of greatness.<br />\\"Rattle and Hum\\" is flawed from the start. In the opening track, \\"Helter Skelter,\\" Bono yells to the crowd, \\"Charles Manson stole this song from The Beatles and we're stealing it back.\\" This would set the stage for several painfully juvenile rants from the frontman of the band. In addition, Bono's lyrics are weak at times. The dated \\"God Part II\\" is ridiculously arrogant, and \\"Hawkmoon 269\\" represents the first time that a U2 album has contained filler.<br />That said, even a sub-par U2 album is better than most records on the market, and this album has some shining moments. \\"Angel of Harlem\\" is a timeless classic; the rollicking \\"Desire\\" has a Bo Diddley beat that is unforgettable; \\"Silver and Gold\\" is an underrated song that had been written around the time of \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\"; and The Edge's chilling protest song, \\"Van Diemen's Land,\\" sounds more like a traditional Irish folk ballad than a song created by a world-class rock band.<br />When all is said and done, \\"Rattle and Hum\\" is impressive, but ultimately unsatisfying. Fortunately, it would be a temporary blip; the last song on the album, the gorgeous \\"All I want Is You,\\" shows musical and lyrical genius from Bono and the boys. And the short but memorable guitar solo in \\"Silver and Gold\\" shows The Edge's growing maturation that would ultimately lead to his spectacular work in the lush, techno-soul of \\"Achtung Baby,\\" the band's mammoth follow-up album. In short, \\"Rattle and Hum\\" represents the sometimespainful growing process of one of the great rock bands of all time.<br />-Marc Hurwitz
B000068IEU|3.0|My first reaction to this film was that is was absolutely terrible. I rented the VHS version because I'd heard it was a classic horror film. I was hardly impressed upon first viewing it and simply dismissed it as a piece of garbage.<BR> The story centers around the kidnapping, rape, torture and murder of two young girls by a group of sadistic sociopaths and the subsequent revenge by one of the girl's parents. The film is obviously very \\"low budget\\" and the acting is really quite atrocious at times. In a scene in which one of the girls looks on as her friend is beaten and raped in the apartment of the killers, her reaction to what she is seeing looks as if she's simply having trouble deciding on what outfit she should wear!! The film has a documentary-like feel to it and it is primarily this aspect of the film which creates such a brutal realism and makes these violent scenes uncomfortable to watch. The humiliation the girls are forced to endure is horrifying because it feels so real. <BR> What surprised me was how this movie stayed with me for days afterwards. It was so disturbing that I couldn't get it out of my head. I noticed that the DVD version had an \\"unedited\\" cut of the film along with commentary by Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham, the makers of the film. Upon a second viewing of the movie, I gained a somewhat sheepish respect for the film. The goal of a movie is to make an impact on it's audience, good or bad, and that's exactly what this film does. This is not a \\"feel good\\" movie and it's not one that I would even recommend to friends and say \\"You have to see this movie!\\" It's fascinating in the same way that car accidents are fascinating. The viewer is horrified at what they're looking at but unable to stop looking. No other movie I have seen has ever captured the level of realism that this one does. You can actually see this happening in real life, just as it plays out on the screen and it is a devastatingly depressing thought. (There is a foreword at thebeginning of the film that claims this was based on a true story, but Wes Craven admits in the commentary track that it, in fact, is not true at all.) The last third of the film, which deals with the parent's revenge is no less violent or disturbing.<BR> There are some lighter comedic scenes (however lame they may be) involving two police officers which does provide a break in the tension created by the film.<BR> The DVD \\"unedited\\" version differs from the VHS version in only a couple of the scenes in which a few seconds of the more graphic violence was trimmed out of the VHS version. The commentary track is interesting to listen to primarily because Wes and Sean make fun of their own movie throughout the entire commentary, cracking jokes and laughing at the movie the entire time. The DVD also contains current interviews from some of the actors in the film who reflect on the movie and it's impact today.
B00006CXXU|1.0|I admit, Christina has a great voice. She can make any dull song very good with just her voice. However, when all the songs on a CD are dull, it just gets too boring. Not ONE song on this album has stood out as anything remarkable. Most of them are slower tempo songs that aren't too appealing. Her older younger-aged fan base will mostly find this CD boring. However, that means she will gain attention of newer and older-aged fans. What I don't understand is.. why did it take her 3-4 years to make THIS? I don't find anything remarkable about it at all...<br />Let's hope album #3 from Christina turns out to be an improvment. She has a great voice, I'd like to see it happen.
078322799X|5.0|peter jackson's horror masterpiece, The Frighteners, is so unusual it almost defies description or definition. <br />it was billed as slap-stick horror/comedy, along the lines of something like Night of the Living Dead. indeed, there are several funny instances and characters - the good ghosts, for example - and Michael J. Fox is a comedian. but that's about as useful as that classification is; the movie possesses the postmodern hyperactivity of a comedy, but not the tone.<br />the grim reaper/serial killer figure is truly terrifying; his motivation is realistic - crazy, yes, but not unbelievable. the style of filming often matches the best film noirs - in fact, the incongruous detective reminds me strongly of Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks. <br />and the location - has there ever been a more apt setting more such a bizzare movie?! the strikingly angular cliffs, the deep bay, the ubiquitous fog,...i cant praise the location-finder enough - i'd love to visit that place someplace. it actually subsumes the characters, it's so striking!
0425170349|2.0|...Clancy undoubtedly is good action writer and a writer who knows the technological gadgetry that goes with the covert operations game. This he uses to good effect.<br />However, I found most characters unidimensional at best, and although Clancy attempts at times to get beneath the skin of the protagonists,  in my opinion, he does not succeed very much.<br />Again, in an effort to build a story, he uses too many coincidences, and simplification of events. How else would you explain the fact that Popov was identified because the discarded passport was located due to a malfunctioning trash-can,...Far far too far-fetched!<br />And one last irritiant, why does Clancy have to use '/' so often. Surely if he can last through 740 pages, he can do more than slash?...
0345446798|5.0|I admit it, I'm an addict when it comes to books on dog behavior.  And I have to say that Patricia McConnell is one of the best authors out there -- she is funny and easy to understand and offers some wonderful insights into canine behavior. This book will make you think twice about how you interact with your dog and teach you how to open up the lines of communication using body language, vocalizations (sometimes less is more here!) and so much more.  If you love your dog, you owe it to him (and to yourself) to pick up this book!
B00006CXXU|4.0|This album is a turn around from her last album.  Looks like she grew up and learned what she can really do with that great voice of hers.  She has explored different elements and brought them together harmoniously.  Great job.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Sexy and romantic.  This record is for all age groups.  Her voice is incredible and the song sellection is excellent. If you like Eva Cassidy you will love Nora Jones.  A must have for any music collection.
B0000029GA|5.0|This album right here is pure poetry. With this album,Stillmatic, and Lost Tapes, Nas should belong with the likes of Rakim and 2pac. The cd starts off with Ny State of Mind, which is one of my favorite songs of all time.Life's a <BR>B!tch is a great song with a bombin verse from AZ and verses from Nas that are great. The world is yours is also one of my favorite songs of all-time as well. This song is da bomb. Next off is Halftime which is an excellent song. Memory Lane is probably the weakest song but is probably better than any song on Nelly, Hova's albums from Volume 1 to Roc la familia, cash money, etc. One Love to me is probably tha best song off this album, but everyone got their opinions.One time 4 your mind is a beautiful song. Represent is another classic banger. Though One love is probably the best song to me, It ain't Hard to tell is my favorite song off this album. <BR>This album is not overrated. You have to listen to the lyrics of this album and compare it to more albums. The lyrics make an album, not the beats, or the hook. Peace out!
B00006CXXU|3.0|christina aguileras new cd, stripped, is supposed to be the pop diva-in-training at her most vulnerable, but instead it pretty much turns into a giant sorrow-fest for the singer. apparently christina went through hell before making this album, cause sometimes it feels like that for the listener. other times, however, she can be provocative, titillating, even intelligent...i know, crazy isnt it. listen to \\"cant hold us down,\\" \\"walk away,\\" \\"get mine, get yours\\" and \\"dirrty\\" and throw the rest of the album away.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This album has given us back the \\"Wonderful, Marvelous\\" Diana's piano and warmful voice that had been forgotten on her last CD, the unfortunate \\"Look of Love\\".<BR>She is singing and playing beautifully in this new one!<BR>Gosh! A live album !<BR>It's all I wanted!<BR>Great, Diana!
B000002NC4|5.0|This record listens like a great novel reads.  One becomes lost in it's folds and forgets to remember that they are merely listening.  Like a great novel, I feel real remorse when the ending sneaks up on me (and somehow the ending always sneaks up on me).  On the occasion that I have time, I have to play it twice.  I can only say that about one other record.  (And that one is a secret I will keep)<br />Rarely a better dollar spent.<br />( by the way, the ending of &quot;Stop the Show&quot; would go on for the rest of my life if I could will it)

0345446798|5.0|This is a wonderful, amazing book about dogs and how us humans relate to them. I absolutely love how she goes over human behavior as primate behavior, and gives descriptions of how us primates will act under certain conditions.<br />She also goes through various instances of dog aggression and how she has dealt with it in her practice.  I enjoyed reading her accounts of when she was getting her PhD, and what her study of interest was.

B00006CXXU|4.0|I was at first apprehensive about buying this CD after hearing Dirrty but I am really glad I did. All the songs are amazing. And with the exception of Dirrty, and maybe one or two others, offer a message of some sort to the listeners. \\"Beautiful\\" is a wonderful ballad about self-esteem. On \\"I'm OK\\" Christina sings about her abusive father with the only backing music being a guitar. This album is full of could-be-singles and is worth every penny!

AND I HAVE LISTENED TO IT NONE STOP SINCE THEN.THIS IS A GREAT CD ....CHRISTINA STEPPED IT UP A BIT TAKING ON THE WRITING OF THE ALBUM.THIS WAS AN IMPRESSIVE CD ALMOST 80 MIN. (77min. 52sec.) WITH OVER 16 SONGS AND 4 INTERLUDES IT WAS REALLY COOL.IT WAS VERY MUCH WORTH THE PRICE FOR THIS CD.ALL THE TRACKS ARE AMAZING I.BUY IT NOW IT'S VERY WELL WORTH IT....
B0000041DF|5.0|No one could possibly be prepared for the firestorm of piano playing on this disc.  Both pieces are often played, often recorded, but rarely with the electricity here.  If you want elegant or &quot;genteel&quot; versions of these pieces, look elsewhere, but if you want something more white-hot, this is the one.<br />The Rachmaninoff may be even too fast for some.  She erupts into the final movement with a seeming recklessness, and part of the excitement is sensing Chailly's surge to keep up with her.  The Tchaikovsky is also amazing in its sheer animal drive.  Yes, she may miss a few notes here and there, but who cares when confronted with such a huge performance.  <br />Again, there are many fine recordings of each of these, but this recording will always be one of those brought out to demonstrate why Argerich is legendary.  A great document, and also a great live recording.  Oh, to have been in the audience!
0743201140|4.0|The authors focus on strengths.  What are they?  Where do they come from?<BR>How does one recognize them?  They distinguish between what can be learned<BR>such as behaviors and skills and the raw materials that each person brings<BR>with them, their passions interests and talents.  These raw materials are<BR>the foundation upon which our strengths are built.  And working from our<BR>strengths is how greatness is achieved.  The authors remind us that the<BR>difference between good and great is measured in relatively small but<BR>significant levels of achievement.<br />The concept of understanding your innate talents and using them to create<BR>consistent superior results in your life runs directly counter to the<BR>notion that we must focus on our weaknesses and work to shore them up.  As<BR>a result very few of us have a clear grasp of what our strengths and<BR>talents are and a disproportionately harsh view of our perceived faults.<BR>The ability to take an honest look at ourselves without being judgmental<br />and critical is key to any real growth.  Therefore I also recommend a book<BR>called &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane.  The<BR>authors are excellent guides into the realm of self-awareness.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have purchased all three of Christina's previous albums and consider myself a fan, but with this album I am now a HUGE fan! I absolutely love it. It is so personal and you feel (with certain tracks) that you're in the studio with her. Since buying \\"Stripped\\" I can not even bare to listen to the first of her albums because it now seems fake and mainstream. If you want to sample just a fraction of the greatness of this album...listen to the track \\"Fighter\\" in it's entirety. Then you will understand. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys talent and diverse music...instead of purchasing a bland cd...buy Christina.

B0000021RG|2.0|After releasing three consecutive double albums, Chicago did the unthinkable by releasing a four record live album.  Chicago IV (Live at Carnegie Hall) is the record that Chicago bashers love to point at as the height of the band's bombast.  To a degree, the critics are correct in their statement.  The album does contain some fine renditions of hits like \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Colour My World\\" & \\"Questions 67 & 68\\" as well as lesser known tracks like \\"Free\\" and \\"Lowdown\\".  But mostly it is an overblown affair with no better example of excess than the five movements of \\"It Better End Soon\\".  Chicago have been unfair whipping boys for the rock press through the years, but on this release, they help give ammunition to their critics.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I was so excited when I heard that this disc was going to be released. Buffy is the best show on TV and its cast is by far the best ensemble. Joss Whedon is a genius and this episode proved that. People may comment on the lack of quality in some of the singers (ie Sarah Michelle) but it wasn't meant to be a perfect performance. Sweet comes to town and the whole town starts singing exposing all the secrets they have been hiding. He didn't come to town to turn them into Mariah Carey. I read that Sarah Michelle was going to use a voice double but when she relaized that someone else would be singing the most important lines of the season, she decided she had to do it. And thank God she did. This was the most pivotal episode of that season where it all came out. Emma Caulfield's Bunnies break is absolutely hysterical and her duet &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot; with Nicholas Brendon is like something from a classic musical. Amber Benson is a joy in her performance of &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; and James Marsters is just too cool in his &quot;Rest In Peace&quot; performance. The songs where the entire cast sings shows the ensemble tightness that I have referred to previously. Buffy fans will love it and musical and non-Buffy fans should give it a listen. Say it with me...Once More With Feeling!
B000069KE0|4.0|Chicago has always had the ability to make solid, entertaining music. They aren't going to make any major musical statements or blow you away, but they make well crafted pop songs that are spiked with jazz influences. Chicago II is one of their best efforts. &quot;Colour My World&quot; is a sweet ballad with a beautiful, lilting melody and on the other side &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; is a rocker with a buzzing guitar. The most impressive part of the album is the musical suite from &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; to &quot;Now More Than Ever&quot; (which was side two of disc one on the original album). Songs slide into one another and the playing is effortless. The band combined the above two songs for a single release that hit the top ten as did &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;. Chicago had a run in the 70's of five consecutive number one albums, but II which is arguably their best album, only managed to reach number four.
0553260111|4.0|This was the first book I read by Robert Ludlum. I can say for sure this won't be the last. Ludlum pulls you along with a string and only lets you know what he wants you to know.

B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder has had many greatest hits packages released during his forty year career.  This new collection is the first single disk set that takes into consideration his earliest work until his final days as a major chart force in the mid 1980's.  Most fans of Mr. Wonder will already have all of these songs, but no one can ever complain about the quality of the music.  Some of these twenty-one songs are among the best songs ever recorded including the epic \\"Living For The City\\", the jazzy \\"Sir Duke\\" and reggafied \\"Master Blaster\\" and the rocking \\"Superstition\\".  While Mr. Wonder was at his ultimate peak in the 1970's, the 80's tracks are very strong including the overlooked classic \\"That Girl\\" and the gorgeous \\"Overjoyed\\".  Stevie Wonder was dubbed the 12-year-old genius, but through the years, his age may have changed, but his genius hasn't.
B00006CXXU|5.0|To sum it up, this album is simply amazing. <br />I love every bit of it. At times some songs remind me of Mariah or even Alicia Keys(with whom Christina collaborates with on the song \\"Impossible\\"). <br />By far the songs that stick out to me are: Walk Away; Beautiful; Make Over; Cruz; Dirrty; The Voice Within; and I'm OK. Those are just my favorites, but I love them all. <br />The only other Christina album I have is her debut and I loved it back then, but this album just shows her in a true light. I can relate to several of these songs which I guess makes me appreciate them more. I didn't know what to think of this new \\"image\\" at first but now I can understand she's being her and all I can say is more power to her. Her voice is beautiful and so is she. This girl rocks!<br />I have to say, if you have not been a Christina fan before, give this album a try, it's the one to change your mind. Stripped has been on repeat in my cd player for the past 4 days and I am NOT tired of it yet!
B000069KGM|4.0|Chicago's self-titled debut album (under the moniker of Chicago Transit Authority) was a bold record upon its initial release.  First the original release was a double album which were becoming popular at the time, but for established artists like The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix.  Second, the band combined jazz elements into their music, which no other group other than Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears was doing at the time.  The album has an experimental feel with the feedback laden \\"Free Form Guitar\\" and the rolling cover of Spencer Davis Group's \\"I'm A Man\\" show as well as the recordings of the infamous 1968 Democratic Convention that occurred in their namesake hometown that are on the record.  But most of the entire album shows the band's strong sense of melody and the first rate music they could make.  \\"Beginnings\\" is an absolutely beautiful ballad that stretches out over seven minutes thanks to a left turn into samba territory.  \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" is an almost perfect pop record that became the band's first top ten single.  \\"Questions 67 &amp; 68\\" shows the band's rock side to equally strong results.  Chicago Transit Authority shows that the band was more than just the corporate rock machine that it would become in the 1970's.  It shows the band had high ambitions as to melding rock, jazz and pop together.  They didn't always succeed, but at least they were willing to try.
B000001E7L|5.0|Since 1992 when they first appeared , The Cranberries have been deeply loved by millions of people who saw in Dollores' confesses a part of themselfs , their anxieties and insecurities . One of the basic reasons which made the irish band to stand out was the fact that they had a personallity in their sound : theirs . <br /> In \\" No Need To Argue \\" the tenderness and imperfect nature of the human soul of \\" Everybody Else Is Doing It... \\" is still present though there's more social and political sensitivity ( \\" Zombie \\" , \\" The Icicle Melts \\" ) . O'Riordan's voice is the perfect viacle for expressing the relapses of the human heart. On \\" Ridiculous Thoughts \\" the vocals get more and more intense as seconds go by , managing to sound both vulnerable and angry at the same time while \\" Twenty One \\" ( especially it's third part ) will move you no matter what music you are into . <br /> The big plus of this album is that it contains many songs which have what it takes to be one's favourites meaning that the tracklist doesn't contain plain fillers . \\" Ode To My Family \\" is probably one of the few hit-singles to handle the family subject in such a nostalgic , beautifull way . \\" Daffodil Lament \\" is an anything but radio-friendly yet exceptional song with a happy-turned sad-turned haunted twist after the halfway mark . Finally the tittle song \\" No Need To Argue \\" is melancholic and beautifully perfomed with O'Riordan whispering and lowering her voice and doing all sorts of magic things with her backing vocals . <br /> Throughout the ten years they've been in the music business , The Cranberries have released a number of great records and especially their first two offerings are in my opinion some of the best music releases of the 90's . Their music has feeling . Genuin feeling that is . And that was never easy to find .
1573225517|5.0|I listened to the audiotape of this book while commuting.  It is hilarious!  Anything that can keep someone laughing through a two-hour traffic jam has a lot to recommend it.<br />I saw the movie years ago and wasn't all that impressed.  But I picked up an audiotape of &quot;About A Boy&quot; and noticed it was by the same author, so I decided to check it out.  I think it's even better.  <br />The reader is fantastic...his somewhat &quot;monotonic&quot; delivery is absolutely perfect for Rob's incredible internal dialogues.  No one I've read has done the dazed, confused and thoroughly bewildered-about-it-all male quite as well...or with such humor.  I can't help really LIKING his guys, no matter what &quot;unforgiveable&quot; things they've done.  I love Rob's clumsy attempts to come to grips with his life! He's constantly trying to figure out either what went on or what's going on taking us along for the ride.  I might even check out the movie again.
0345440900|1.0|I am a first-time mother of a 6 month-old (and stepmom to an 8 year-old), and I have read a lLOT about child development and baby care.  This book is just awful, in my opinion.  She is very dogmatic and opinionated, but there is no basis for her statements, just her opinion.  In fact, I find her tone annoying and condescending.  Her opinions on breastfeeding are bizarre, biased, scientifically and factually inaccurate, and will likely create problems for Moms who follow it in terms of milk supply, especially for young babies.  And there is a lot of emphasis on &quot;independence&quot;.  She has one example of parents of a 3 week old (yes, 3 WEEKS) who didn't want to be put down, she wanted to be held.  Tracy saw this as a problem.  Excuse me?  Of course a 3 week-old needs to be held!  She mentions a couple who got their child to sleep through the night and &quot;finally got their life back.&quot;  Well, perhaps they shouldn't have had a child in the first place if they didn't want to be inconvenienced.  And she is so disdainful of co-sleeping, as if it is a foreign idea.  In fact, it is only recently in our post-industrial, western society that children sleep alone.  Obviously, co-sleeping is not for everyone, but to talk about it like it is something done only in primitive countries (she refers to Bali, for some weird reason) is absurd.  Most parents sleep with their children at least some of the time.  She takes the joy and spontaneity out of parenting.  Of course flexible schedules are good for the baby and you.  Of course talk to you and with your child.  Of course respect your child.  But she contradicts herself, as many of her techniques are very disrespectful of the baby.  Here are some much better choices:  The Baby Book by William Sears, The No Cry Sleep Solution, by Elizabeth Pantley,  Mother and Fathering by Tine Thinevin, and What to Expect the First Year.
B00006CXXU|5.0|She took her time coming out with this album, and it's been worth the wait, in my opinion.  This is the real Christina, probably was all along. But we all get it the last album.  You have to break in, right, to have the power to do what you want to do...  <BR>She's got one helluva voice and the tracks on here are so diverse.  Love INFATUATION, LOVING ME 4 ME, SOAR, KEEPING ON SINGING MY SONG, UNDERAPPRECIATED, MAKE OVER (very rock, love it)<br />I hate giving reviews, but this transformation deserved the effort.  She's really over what people say about her, her look, etc - you feel that laced into the music.<BR>Highly recommended.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|I THINK THAT THE 8 MILE CD IS ANOTHER FINE EXAMPLE OF THE EXPERT WORK OF EMINEM AND DR DRE. WHEN DRE SAW EMINEM HE MUST HAVE SAW THE FUTURE AND THE FLAVOR THAT EMINEM COULD COULD BRING TO HIP HOP MUSIC. EMINEM IS MATURING AND THERE IS NO TELLING HOW FAR HE CAN GO AS LONG AS HE KEEPS HIS HEAD.THIS IS A FINE AND WONDERFUL CD.

B000065U1N|1.0|If you like explosions and gunfire, you just might find this movie tolerable.<br />If you like movies that don't expect you to suspend all belief or second-guess every single ridiculous action in the plot, stay away from this one.<br />I can't count how many times we found ourselves saying &quot;Why didn't they just...&quot; or &quot;Why did they...&quot;.<br />A very stupid movie. Period.
B000000W5N|1.0|The acoustics on this are terrible unlike the 2002 releases on DSD/SACD which are outstanding. I own this and never listen to it . I also own the record from the 1970s and I love it  but the CD butchered the music. Brown Sugar is unlistenable. Wait for it to be released on DSD.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Whatever you do, don't judge Stripped by its cover -- either the provocative (read: tarty) front cover, or your initial impression of first single \\"Dirrty.\\" The worst song of 2002 won't give you any indication of what's to come. <BR>Fact is, as a pop record, Stripped is practically flawless: There's not a single dud among the other 15 tracks, and the number of highlights is mind-boggling. Torch songs, guitar-tinged mid-tempo numbers -- the work on Aguilera's second album is impeccable, from the songs to the production to her rich, multi-timbral voice. This album is to the former teenybopper what Daydream was to Mariah Carey: A collection of sure-to-be hits that's also a perennially strong, occasionally magical pop album. <br />Carey comparisons will fly on the numerous piano-driven ballads (\\"The Voice Within,\\" \\"Soar\\") where Aguilera indulges in vocal workouts over the nuanced orchestrations; hopefully strong tear-jerkers \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" will relieve her of the impulse to cover Etta James' \\"At Last\\" in concert. The power ballad (\\"Cruz\\") and the sugary hip-pop cut (\\"Can't Hold Me Down\\") come just as effortlessly. <br />But where Aguilera finally distinguishes herself -- from Mariah, Britney, or whomever -- is in her willingness to take chances, and put in the effort to make them pay off. There's no doubt that ardent fans are going to hate parts of this record; they're not going to be prepared for psychedelic power pop (the very Hole-like \\"Make Over\\"), atmospheric neo-soul (\\"Loving Me 4 Me\\"), or street-corner funk (\\"Underappreciated\\") -- and certainly won't like the results. <br />They'll likely be flabbergasted by the Alicia Keys-penned \\"Impossible\\" -- which sounds like Motown soul channeled through Ronnie Spector -- and depressed by the particularly chilling guitar-based ballad \\"I'm Okay,\\" which recasts her father's abusive behavior in all the painful and weird ways Top 40 tries to avoid. In all this, though, is the real definition of Stripped: The real Christina Aguilera coming into her own, a beautiful thing to behold
0375414053|3.0|I Don't Know How She Does It's strengths include some lovely, witty one-liners and great insights into the frazzled and still lonely world of striving businesswomen. But some things about the books seemed so very '80s, making me wonder what this book had that was new and fresh. The only thing I could conclude is that women in London are 20 years behind the U.S. and that current readers have missed out on the last 25 years of feminist fiction. Pearson's story opens with the main character \\"distressing\\" a mince pie prior to the school carol concert--an image that current and former working moms can certainly relate to and understand. Unfortunately, the author went on to describe, in great detail, why she harbored such guilt, her own psychological underpinnings, and a plethora of details about the actual \\"distressing\\" technique. All of which served to undermine everything invoked in the first paragraph. This is my main complaint: too much back story, too much explaining. These faults are so endemic to first novels that maybe they aren't even considered a problem for readers. But I found Pearson's overly adipose prose slowed the book--and with a target market of harried, sleep-deprived, time-challenged readers (such as the main character), that seemed a serious mistake. They need a faster read.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|I Dont Know what it is about this album. I cant exactly describe the music except for that it was really good.
B000003TBP|5.0|This album has been played so often and so much in my player, that I can't even tell you.  I got this album when it came out because I really liked loser on Mellow Gold, but never got the whole CD.  I liked several songs I heard from this album and was quickly addicted.  Now I own many Beck albums including Mutations which is his best, guarunteed!  Now Mutations requires deep listening and learning the music more before appreciating it, this album can be appreciated immediately and repeatedly.  This is probably the most accessible, upbeat and cohesive album of Beck's.  Well worth the investment.
B000000YG5|5.0|I am not very familiar with any of Rollins' work, this is his only album I own. I only got it because it was highly reccomended, I'm just here to reinforce that reccomendation. Rollins is full of energy, not to mention the rest of his group. Tommy Flanagan's solo's are a beauty, and the bassist is impressive too. Oh yeah, Max roach, enough said. I love every part of this album, an instant fav.
B00006LWSF|5.0|Oft used and rarely applicable, the tag \\"Music from and inspired by the motion picture\\" means little to most, but it takes on a pretty damn personal role for Marshall Mathers on the accompanying soundtrack to his first movie. Anyone can tell you there's a lot riding on this, and Eminem won't get his own Purple Rain so easily; he's questioned his own failures in life, but has yet to do so in front of his public, though, heaven knows, plenty of people are waiting. <BR>Eminem doesn't give them the chance musically, as he takes the first three tracks with particular vengeance -- there are no potshots at boy bands, diatribes against his mother (not the real one, anyway), or misogynist humor. Instead, there's plenty of fire about coming up from nothing and being everything: \\"Lose Yourself\\" may be the most immediate anthem he's yet written; it's certainly more \\"fight music\\" than the D12 track of the same name. <br />Impressive, too, is a fiery, one-breath internal monologue written from the perspective of his on-screen character (what, you thought \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" was a John Updike reference?) that's all passionate verse and no chorus. <br />Eminem's words -- and music, since he produced most of it -- set the rest of the album's tone: Hard, cold and mean. The unified theme has its benefits, keeping things consistent; new material by veterans Gang Starr (\\"Battle\\") and Rakim (\\"R.A.K.I.M.\\") holds up nicely against next Gen Y guys like Xzibit and Young Zee's surreal funk on \\"My Ni99a for Real.\\" Macy Gray's cheery \\"Time of Your Life\\" is an odd choice, but then this is a soundtrack that puts the feuding Nas and Jay-Z on back-to-back tracks. <br />Mathers slips only when he tries to play out the movie's rags-to-riches vibe with his friends. Though Shady Records artists 50 Cent and Obie Trice each get a banger (\\"Wanksta\\" and \\"Adrenaline Rush\\", respectively), their presence on four tracks comes off as rather blatant self-promotion; even Em's alleged ex-girlfriend, actress Taryn Manning, got a song (\\"Wasting My Time,\\" under the BoomK.A.T. moniker). For a guy whose presence is everywhere on 8 Mile, it would have been nice if he was more vocal about it.
0066620996|5.0|This is a great read for success in business tips.  It sounds like the author has really done his homework in noting the differences between successful business and unsucessful ones.  This makes for a great guide to getting ahead in the financial world. Another book I would like to recommend that helps one to get ahead in the realm of inner peace is called, &quot;The Little Guide To Happiness&quot;.  Both are of eqaul value given what each is trying to help us achieve.
0312265859|1.0|A good book is supposed to be memorable.  That is exactly the opposite of what the past two books in the Stephanie Plum series have been.  I read each one as it is released, and I loved the first four.  Five was a bit a downturn, but 6 brought the standard back up.  I don't even remember much of 7, and, I had to read the synopsis to remember anything about 8. <br />Read any of the first four books (esp 1-3) and then read any from the last four and notice the style change.  It feels to me like Evanovich has stopped really trying to make it interesting, like she would rather pump one out ever June (well, now its shortened to 1 every 6 months with the Xmas book out in November) than have a well-written mystery novel on her hands.  <br />I thought this title, in particular, was simplistic, predictable, and not mysterious.  Gags were thrown in just for laughs, but they were hackneyed and overdone.<br />C'mon, Janet, if you take a bit longer to do another re-write or two, we won't hold it against you.  I mean, look at Sue Grafton: it takes her atleast a year and a half between books and it shows.  When her series got formulaic, she changed it up (and it took her a bit longer to write the next couple, but man is the series great).
B00005R62K|4.0|Stained Class was released when the disco craze was at its peak. Kiss, Rod Stewart and others released albums at this time, too. Remember \\"I was made for loving you baby...\\" and \\"If ya think I'm sexy and ya want my body come on let me know...\\" and similar monuments to musical idiocy? Well, you're not going to find any hint of that from Judas Priest. This is a fine guitar-based album from the early years of genuine heavy metal. You can certainly tell it is pre-1980s but even for that era Priest's sound was unique. You certainly will not confuse it with Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith.
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a great book.  It gives the readers a view of life from a different pespective and not from the usual norm that society expects from us. With this book, Morrie is giving the readers the opportunity to analyze their life style and reflect on in.  We need to make the best of it, and not waver on it, because if we do we may not have the change to enjoy it to the fullest.

B000002ADT|4.0|Yes, this is a good album, but the best jazz album ever recorded? I don't think so, and neither did Davis. The problem that plagues this album is one which hounds many artists. Shakspeare's Romeo and Juliet is an example of the same problem, which is an early work by a great artist that is not as good as what fallowes, but for some reason is obsessed over by fans to the disapointment of the artist. To find another musical example, Keith Jarrett's Koln concert. This is not the best jazz album, since there is no such thing. If you're comming to worship and be saved at the alter of Kind of Blue, you'll soon find out you're worshiping a golden bull. And yes, I know what happens when I insult your god, I get plagued with 'unhelpful' votes for eternity.
6302989787|4.0|Unlike the usual thriller where you can see how it ends long before the ending, this one actually has some mystery and tension.  You *know* in the back of your brain that he's gonna get the bad guy. But how?  The back and forth dialog between the two build things up nicely, I wish Hollywood would do that more often instead of relying on the typical car crash or gigantic explosion.  See this movie!  You'll be on the edge of your seat by the time the two finally get together for the show-down!
B00005K9LK|5.0|This is one of the top 10 heavy metal albums ever released. Just straight-forward, true unabashed classic heavy metal from a time before there were a dozen sub-genres. This is the first Priest album to use the &quot;huge&quot; modern heavy metal guitar sound that set the standard for every metal act to follow. &quot;Hellion&quot; is the fanfare for the new era in rock guitar that was to follow.

B00006LLNU|5.0|I was given a Sigur Ros C.D. a couple of years ago when their last album came out. Having no knowledge who they were, I anxiously skimmed through every song waiting for something obviously dynamic or for words that were understandable. They without a doubt grow on you. They are from Iceland and I have no clue what any of the lyrics if they are lyrics say or mean. Surprisingly I still very much enjoy Sigur Ros, you do not focus on the lyrics but everything else. Please do not expect Sigur Ros to have songs that you can pop on while taking a bunch of your friends out and be able to sing along. I can guarantee you that they are perfect for background or chill music. It seems quite slow and simple, but the more you listen, the more complex it becomes. It is very complex to get slow, drawn out sounds to be able to blend as well as they do. The singer also has a beautiful, almost chilling voice. I have only had this C.D. for a few days and have had it on heavy rotation, the best part is that the songs are impossible to get sick of. I also enjoy this C.D. slightly more than their other C.D. I would recomend this for anyone who needs a relaxing C.D., everyone needs at least one, and someone who is looking for something a little different.

B00006AW2J|5.0|Unquestionably one of the best albums of 1968, this blues-rock masterpiece started off the Stones' best years, from 1968-1972. Although I prefer its sister album, Let It Bleed, Beggars contains Sympathy For the Devil, perhaps the best thing the band ever did. Starting with the opening conga beat, the song rolls into a relentless groove, propelled by Nicky Hopkins' piano and especially Bill Wyman's magnificent bass playing. Keith's slashing solo is icing on the cake, and Jagger writes some of his best lyrics. The ferocious rocker Stray Cat Blues features more of that screeching electric guitar, with a coda to knock your socks off. <br /> The rest of Beggars is primarily acoustic. Also seen are the last flashes of brilliance from the late Brian Jones. On the beautiful ballad No Expectations, he delivers a terrific passage of bottleneck guitar, and there's more of his tasty slide on Jigsaw Puzzle. Soon after, his drug use worsened, and he was found dead in his pool a year later. Moving back to the songs, the 2nd most well-known number here is Street Fighting Man. A hard rock song with vicious acoustic guitars and revolutionary lyrics, this one of the record's best. Also standing out for me are the Dylan-esque Jigsaw Puzzle, and then there's Salt of the Earth, one of the most uplifting songs I've ever heard. Prodigal Son has some great guitar and hilarious singing by Jagger, as does Dear Doctor (the latter cracks me up every time!). Finally, there's Parachute Woman, a raw blues number, and the gorgeous Factory Girl. All in all, a superb album. Buy it today.
B00006F7S4|2.0|When I read the 5 star review that Rolling Stone gave this and the 9 out of 10 score Spin gave it I ran out to buy it. While I expected a masterpiece that fused Nick Drake with some more modern sensibilities what I found instead was a boring, derivative album with a few electronic flourishes that failed in all ways to deliver. I'm not saying its a bad album as it isn't. But the melodies are bland and boring with very few exceptions. File this with Wilco's Yankee Foxtrot Hotel (or whatever its called) and Sleatter Kinney's One Beat as one of the most disappointing, over-hyped and under-delivering albums of the last several years.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm so happy about the new CD, Stripped, of Christina Aguilera.<BR>We've been waiting for this for a long time but our patience is now rewarded.<br />I love 'Dirrty', but it's true that it doesn't show at all what the album is about... so if you didn't like Dirrty, you may like the album.<br />I knew that Christina wanted to reveal who she really is so I was afraid she did too much to show that she's not a teen pop princess. Fortunately, she prooved what she wanted to in the most wonderful way.<BR>I also have to admit that her first CD was mostly teen-targeted and didn't reveal all her artistic potential. This one is really for everyone, a much more mature and large audience. The sounds are different from one track to one other but they still all have \\"Christina's touch\\". It goes from Latin, to Rock, passing through Hip Hop and real Blues.<BR>The Lyrics are also pretty good. She cowrote most of the songs and some, like 'I'm OK' (which is about her father hiting her mother), are really personal and touching (you can actually hear her crying when she sings, it's really moving).<br />My favorite songs depend on my mood actually. I love Dirrty, Walk Away, Fighter, I'm Ok, Make Over, Beautiful. Honestly, I like every single track (even the interludes) but those ones are my favorites.<br />People may have prejudice about Christina because she started making pop music, but this album, if they take the time to listen to it, will really change their mind, wheter they like it or not.

B00000IMTF|4.0|A GIGANTIC HAND COMES OUT OF THE SEA AND GRABS A RAINBOW, WHILE a tiny little man watches in awe! Never has an album cover<br />fit the music and the lyrics of an album so well. This is a very<br />powerful album, with some very GRIPPING SONGS and virtuoso per-<br />formances. I've said in my other reviews of RAINBOW albums that<br />I now find some of DIO's medieval, dungeons and dragons lyrics<br />kind of silly. Well, they weren't when DIO first started writing<br />them with RAINBOW. If RAINBOW wasn't exactly RITCHIE BLACKMORE<br />at his best, it certainly was RONNIE JAMES DIO at his best. His<br />singing voice is very strong and mighty on this, especially on the album's three longest tracks, and my three favorite tracks, TAROT WOMAN, STARGAZER and A LIGHT IN THE BLACK.<br />  A LIGHT IN THE BLACK was one song I could not get into for a<br />long time...it's now my favorite song on the album. Lyrically,<br />it's a continuation of STARGAZER..kind of like STARGAZER, PT 2,<br />with DIO dealing with the aftermath of the wizard's fall and him<br />trying to find his way afterwards( if I interpreted it correctly). Musically, it's the fastest and probably heaviest song on RISING and TONY CAREY gets in one very wild and crazy<br />synthesizer solo. Kudos also go out to drummer COZY POWELL, whose<br />heavy and solid drumming style makes these songs sound heavier<br />and beefier...he was definitely RAINBOW's best drummer and he<br />really makes his presence known here, especially on the beginning<br />of STARGAZER. TONY CAREY gets in a nice synth solo on TAROT WOMAN, but he's barely heard at all on the rest of the album, with the notable exception of A LIGHT IN THE BLACK.<br /> Which brings me to the album's one real flaw, which is the mix.<br />JIMMY BAIN's bass guitar is barely audible on this..him and CAREY<br />are low in the mix for the most part. I really do love BLACKMORE's guitar playing AND his songwriting, but the sound could've been heavier if the bass was cranked up a tad in the mix.<br /> Back to the songs, every DIO-RAINBOW album had at least one up-<br />beat, fun, get down and boogie rock-n-roll song on it and RISING's song is DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES. It's actually my least<br />favorite song on the album, but it does break up the mood of the<br />album for 2 or 3 minutes.<br />BLACKMORE gets in some catchy, heavy and original guitar licks<br />on this album and his soloing is as brilliant as ever and more<br />middle eastern/snake charmer flavored than ever before.<br /> This is a very enjoyable hard rock/heavy metal album...to say<br />the very least...or most...or all of the above..put in a blender<br />with some peanut butter and ice cream and waffles and milk and..............to the songs, every DIO-RAINBOW album had at least one up-<BR>beat, fun, get down and boogie rock-n-roll song on it and RISING's song is DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.

B00000IQW0|3.0|Just to clarify this for those who are reading other reviews.... I was 9 when this movie (yes MOVIE) came out in theatres before they did put it on TV.  In fact the TV version replaced an original plot point where Baltar, the evil humans name, was killed by the Cylons when the BG got away.<br />So yes there was a movie first.  This is not a pilot episode it was a film that they just turned into a TV series by showing the movie on TV with slight adjustments.<br />The Film in its time was great.  I loved it as a kid (Not that lame BG 1980 when they get to Earth though that was very bad....)<br />The problem was the series was just too expensive in its day and they could not afford it for TV.  That and falling ratings killed it.  <br />The movie now is a bit dated as Star Wars and the Original Star Trek look like ScFi of the era but it is still a reasonably good film/TV Shows.  Just take the acting with the same grain of salt that you do the acting is Star Wars and you are ok!
B00006V9A0|5.0|This review will be short.  To sum it all up, Nirvana forever changed the musical landscape in the 1990's with their style and play.  Out were the no-substance, commercial \\"glam rock\\" bands such as Poison, Motley Crue, Whitesnake and Winger.  Rock bands and their fans now actually had something great to listen to.  Nowadays, we seem to headed into the same direction.  How do I know?  Because when I heard Nirvana's latest release, recorded EIGHT YEARS AGO, it seemed like it was one of the best songs I'd heard in a few years.  I bought this CD the very day it came out, and I am back in love with the alt-grunge scene of the early 90's.  Buy it, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.  Nirvana is definitely one of the top 3 bands of the last decade-and-a-half, hands down.
B00003OSU4|5.0|This movie has its ups and downs. The downs are the minutes spent touring the area. The ups are the great artists and combinations of artists that you see-Dinah Washington, Mahalia Jackson, Big Maybelle, Louis Armstrong, Jo Jones, Rudy Rutherford, and Chuck Berry. Rock? Jazz? No, mom, it doesn't sound like the record! Chuck Berry's Sweet Little Sixteen is a milestone in whatever genre. With Count Basie's oh-so-smooth drummer Jo Jones setting the beat and Rudy Rutherford's WILD! clarinet solo this song captures the freedom and joy of rock/jazz. I wore out this section on my old VHS copy! Rutherford and Berry create amazing voodoo on stage! The rhythms, the back beat, the syncopation! If you don't love it you don't understand rhythm and blues!
B00005KHJR|4.0|You've made your masterpiece and then someone comes up and carves it into a less than comprehensible mess. It's happened to a number of fine films; Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons, Gilliam's Brazil. It's no surprise that this well written suspense thriller from the late Anthony Shaffer (Sleuth, Frenzy)and Robin Hardy was sliced and diced. What's truly tragic is that the bulk of the footage is in a landfill under a freeway in England.<br />Future Blade Runner producer Michael Deely hated The Wicker Man and proceeded to have it disemboweled (much like the hatchet job that was done to Blade Runner). This special edition is unique in a number of ways: 1) It includes 11 minutes of important footage that helps clarify the story and movitations. 2) It features both versions (the restored version was assembled from a print given to Roger Corman when he bid on the distribution rights)of the film. 3)The documentary discusses the origin of the film, what went right (very little) and wrong (a lot)during production and post-production. All the main actors are interviewed as are director Hardy and writer Shaffer. 4)The special edition of the film comes packaged in a unique wooden box with the imposing logo and wickerman burned into the cover.<br />I'd recommend reading amazon.com's plot synopsis. They do a pretty good job of summarizing the film. If you're not interested in the restored edition, pick up the theatrical release. It also includes the documentary and the trailers. The print is pristine.<br />Anchor and Bay have once again done an outstanding job on this low budget minor English classic. It features one of Christopher Lee's finest performances. Edward Woodward does a great job as the police inspector (the role was originally written with Peter Cushing in mind. Cushing was detained due to another film role).<br />It's not the Citizen Kane of horror films but it is a fine, well made and imagined suspense thriller. The closing moments are gripping and powerful.
0790725657|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is so uplifting and entertaining. Sarah, the main character starts out the movie living in exotic India with her father. He ends up needing to go to war, so sends Sarah to a boarding school in New York. He tells her she is a little princess, that all girls are. I won't spoil the  great plot for you by giving anymore details to the story, but I will say that I was touched and uplifted by Sarah's great level of character. She is very generous, talented, thoughtful, and she can believe she will be alright, even in cruel circumstances, and she is more than alright! There is a perfect ending to this perfect movie. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.
6305922756|5.0|I have watched this DVD maybe 40-50 times.  Once with a real square homemaker type- or so I thought- until I watched her nearly pee her pants laughing at this film.  This movie is absolutely hysterical.  It pokes fun at rock bands, especially heavy metal bands beyond their prime.  But you can find a little bit of all of them in here. I might never be able to look at Led Zepplin, Blue Oyster Cult or Deep Purple the same way ever again.  I don't want to ruin the film so here is one and only one example.  While getting ready to play a concert in Cleveland The band members exit their dressing rooms and actually get lost trying to find the stage.  Even after getting help from an old maintenance man they make a complete circle and still can't find it.  Okay now I can't stop- or the bass player setting off a metal detector in the airport because he has a cucumber wrapped in aluminum foil in his pants to accentuate his &quot;package&quot;... or during their gothic anthem &quot;Stonehendge&quot; a 20 inch monolith descends upon the stage with dwarfs dancing around it (lead guitarist #1 doesn't know the difference between feet and inches and screws up the design request)...  There are so many great lines in here, many of them from their manager (i.e. &quot;Australian's Nightmare&quot;,etc.) and a ton of up and coming stars.  Look carefully and you'll spot Paul Schaeffer, Billy Crystal, Howard Hesseman, Fran Drescher, the list goes on and on. This movie is one of the truly funny films that I can reccomend to anyone with a brain and guarantee you will absolutely love it and want to watch it again and again.
B000069AT7|5.0|This is a timeless classic and a must have for every family.  After viewing everything on this 3 disc Special Edition, I really learned alot of how the movie was developed and thought of.  For people that have not seen the movie, it is about an Extra Terrestrial left behind on Earth that finds friendship with a boy struggling with his parents divorce.  Eliott the Boy helps E.T. contact his planet so they can come back and take E.T. home.  <br />What's in the Box:<BR>The Special Edition comes with 3 DVDs, a book about the movie, and a senitype.  Also included is the complete soundtrack on CD.<BR>DVD1<BR>Has the extended version of the film along with some extra features<BR>DVD2<BR>Has the original 1982 version untouched and unedited along with some extra features.<BR>DVD3<BR>Packed full with extra features, mostly concentrating on the reunion and editing of the extended version of the film.<br />How is the Extended Version?<BR>Many people have complained about this version of the film.  Why was it untouched.  I personally feel that it was very well done.  They movie was not altered really in anyway and was very close to the original.  Spielberg even noted that he did not put in the cameo of Harrison Ford because he did not want to alter the original film.  Most of the enhancements were on E.T.'s face due to facial constraints with the original.  If you notice the Eyes are a bit brighter that the original and really bring E.T. to life.  I was afraid of the whole walkie talkie idea but when I saw the scene, it was done superbly.  Not even noticable at all and if you are watching the film for the first time.  You will not even know the difference.  The film transfer is also excellent and compression flaws are kept to a minimum.<br />1982 version<BR>For you die hard fans out there this version has been untouched.  The digital tranfer is just as good as the enhanced version.<br />Worth the extra money?<BR>Don't be fooled.  Even though the 2 disc version doesn't say it hasthe 1982 version included it does.  Spielberg found out that many people were complaining about having to fork over extra cash to get both versions and stepped in making the production company include both version with the 2 disc set.<br />If you are a fan of this movie, I would defenitly say get the Gift box set.  You get an extensive amount of extras which you don't with the 2 disc set as well as some collector items.  If you just like watching the movie the stick with the cheaper version.<br />...I am glad it is finally available on DVD because my VHS was deteriorating.
630021463X|5.0|This was a great movie - I loved the plot - they needed a humpback whale to communicate with a probe but the humpbacks are extinct in Kirk and Spock's time so they time travel to the 1980's to get some whales! I love seeing the whole crew of the Enterprise wandering around San Fransisco in the 80's - the makers of this movie came up with some great lines and scenes! It is a challenge to get a couple of whales beamed up to the Enterprise properly! I can't stress enough how well they put this movie together. I think anyone would enjoy this, not just Star Trek fans. When I first saw it I wasn't a fan yet and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Only two stars? I set my standards very high when it is DM concerned. They didn't deliver this time...it is, quite frankly, a boring cd. Almost all songs are slowly paced, which is not always bad. But they are, and that is a real shame, uninspired written songs. I Feel Love, Shine On are exceptions to the rule and it's no surprise that these song were chosen as a single. And of course there are some good songs on this cd, hey this is DM! But listening to the whole cd in one time is hard because of the consistency (meaning:dull) throughout which in this case is not a good thing. A real shame, I was never dissappointed by DM. Well there is a first time for everything I guess. Conclusion: singles from this cd are good (not great). Overall impression though is poor.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This new CD from Sigurros is one of the greatest musical experiences of the century, you can really just sit back and enjoy this one.  I'd recommend this one to anyone who likes any kind of music.  These Icelanders really know what their doing !!
6301966988|4.0|Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore star in this movie as a couple who are very happy with their life and have just moved into a new apartment. Patrick's character is killed early in the movie - but that isn't the last you see of him! He is the ghost the movie is named after. He tries to find out who killed him and then realizes his girlfriend is in great danger. She doesn't believe in the afterlife, so when Patrick recruits a spiritual medium played by Whoopi Goldberg to convince her to listen, it takes some doing. It also takes some doing to keep Whoopi involved, which makes for a funny yet suspenseful movie as the danger of the bad guy gets worse.
0792833236|5.0|Boxing and the movies have had a long standing love affair. ...Boxing has indeed had its golden moments, with great performances by James Cagney in City For Conquest, Kurt Douglas in Champion and Anthony Quinn in Rod Serling's Requiem For A Heavyweight, (Catch the neat cameo of Caccius Clay just after the opening credits). There's nowhere to hide in the ring and the camera proves this all too often. Here it's done with stunning Black & White elegance and style.<br />So how does Raging Bull stack up with the aforementioned greats of the genera? The Bull is the Heavey Weight Champ, (actually LaMotta was the Middle Weight Champ and he trained DeNiro personnly). DeNiro and Pesci play off each other so naturally you'd swear they were real life brothers. When they fight it out THEY FIGHT IT OUT. So \\"Give this bull a stage where he can rage\\" and don't be a \\"mama-luca\\"...Catch this one in all it's cinimatic brilliance. Scorsse realy hit it out of the park on this one.... I mean to say, he delivers one hell of a knockout punch!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I just bought the cd and am thoroughly pleased with it. This isn't a cd for little girls ages 3-13 like some of her previous stuff. The album is all about her voice and some great writing. If you are looking for typical pop, you might want to look elsewhere. She has definetely changed for the better!
0375414053|1.0|As a woman financial professional, I have to throw my lot in with the reviewer who works in international finance -- good concept, poor execution. The story is implausible and the lead character unsympathetic. The book is a gimmicky string of would-be bon mots and cliches, the author clearly has no deep understanding of what goes into a financial career, and simply pasted her \\"ditzy female columnist married to a successful man\\" sensibility onto a poorly thought out character.<br />Someone like Kate Reddy, who spends half her day writing emails to her female colleague, wouldn't last a day as a mutual fund manager -- and shouldn't. And unfortunately, the book makes a great case that women with children ought to stay in low key careers.<br />I have seen business screech to a grinding halt, and underlings get dumped with work that is never rewarded, when working mothers take their maternity leaves, and come back, like this character, after however long a leave, unable to do their jobs because they spend half their day on the phone to the nanny, the other half complaining about their double burden.  Is it business's fault to want to put people whose minds are on their work in key positions?<br />The character seems to want to work in finance because of the perks of luxury travel.  She presents a narrow view of City/Wall Street life -- constantly harping on the prep school, upper crust nature (while buying right into it with her nanny lifestyle), when anyone who has worked there knows it is probably less elitist than most other fields, and full of colorful characters.<br />The real economics of the character's life never come into focus -- most people who work in finance do so because they desperately need the money, for one reason or another. The way this character bails out into an insecure future just doesn't ring true.<br />This book is about working mothers and will flatter their sensibility, but even so is all surface and no substance.<br />It is not about women working in finance.  If you want to read an intelligent take on what it's like to be a woman in finance with a complicated personal life, read Kate Jennings' Moral Hazard. It's a real book, whereas this one is a fake.men working in finance.

0679879269|5.0|Phillip Pullman is an amazing author. I have followed this series from the very beginning, when The Golden Compass was released.  I actually had the chance to meet him before The Amber Spyglass came out.  I would recomend this series to everybody, because even if fantasy is not your preferred choice of genres, everyone can relatate to the emotional stife that the characters have to go though.  The selfless sacrifices characters make for the common goal are incredible to anyone from the current selfish mindset of our culture.  Following Lyra and Will through their emergence of concsiousness is a  experience where one can relate and examine one's own development.  I would also recomend reading the books in order, it will be a much more satisfying experience.
B00005ABX0|4.0|I think that most people respond favorably to the second side of Today and to Pet Sounds.  They are really hard to argue with, and for me, two of my Top 10 albums from the sixties.<br />These are different.  Wild Honey will have the more universal appeal.  It is a very good album with a couple good hit singles and is more of a return to the origins of rock (R&B) as well as a forshadowing of the R&B direction that rock will take in a few years.  Great to have it with remastered sound and worth every cent.<br />Smiley Smile will depend on your expectations and where you are coming from.  It has 2 great songs (GB, H&V), some good ones (With Me Tonight) and others that don't make it for me (She's Going Bald).  But the experiments that fail here are at least ambitious ones, and sometimes more interesting than a lot of more conventional, \\"successful\\" compositions--like a not so great Bertolucci film (such as Little Buddha, as opposed to a great one like the Conformist).  You still feel that it has enriched you in a way that a more traditional, conventional work may not have. <br />So it is with Smiley Smile--sometimes greatness, sometimes too many drugs--melodies that can be extraordinary in a song that may be less than the sum of its parts-but I'm glad it's here.
B00000ILDE|3.0|I have to agree with most of the 5 star reviews, Aliens is a great, classic science fiction film. Unfortuantely, Cameron's \\"Special Edition\\" takes a masterpiece and messes it up. <br />Like the extremely dodgy Abyss Special Ed., Aliens SE adds nothing and, in the end, takes far too much away. For example, the \\"restored\\" opening sequence of the space miners makes literal what we simply imagined in the original. Now we get to see the plodding exposition that sets up the story whereas in the original we went straight into the action. Elsewhere, a complete alternative section of the film (where the Marines are trapped) diverges into an anti-climactic sequence featuring gattling guns. While in most films, these restored scenes would be just fine, Aliens as it was originally released was far, far scarier, faster and more exciting.<br />As this is the only version now available on DVD, you have very little choice, buy or don't buy. In an ideal world however, we'd get a branching version of the DVD where the viewer gets to choose what verison they want to see, keeping both purists and revisionists happy.<br />If only.
B00006CXXU|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS EXCELLENT FROM START TO FINISH. EXTARORDINARY VOICE. SHE EXPRESSES HER FULL RANGE. SHE INFUSES LATIN,HIP HOP,ROCK,POP, &amp; R&amp;B I ON THIS CD. SHE HELPED WRITE AND PRODUCE OVER 90% OF THE MATERIAL. I RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU WANT TO HEAR GREAT MUSIC. NO TEENY BOPPING POP MUSIC HER. THIS IS CHRISTINA'S ADULT SET. HER VOCAL RANGE IS A COMBO OF WHITNEY &amp; MARIAH.
0613256182|5.0|If you haven't read this vampire novel, you need too.  Richard Matheson wrote one of the most original, gritty horror tales ever with I Am Legend.  I picked it up back in 1985, while working on a ranch in Wyoming for the summer.  I read this dark, bump-in-the-night tale while sleeping in the bunkhouse, and at times found myself looking at the opened hay-loft doors and windows to see if a white, bloodless face was peering in at me.<br />This is a gothic vampire tale placed in modern America and crouched in science.  Robert Neville is the last human survivor after a plague has either killed everyone else (including his family) or transformed them into blood-lusting vampires.  He now lives a barely sane life in a constant fight for survival, battling vampires, depression, and alchoholism.  What he goes through is both heartbreaking and terrifying.  And yet he portrayes mankind with all his weakness, and strengths, as he pulls himself up by the straps and begins teaching himself blood chemistry and medicine, in a heartfelt attempt to cure the vampires, and save his sanity.<br />The novel is tightly written, filled with scenes that will raise the hackles and send your skin crawling.  Try reading this one at night.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a very bland album by Christina Aguilera.  It is supposed to show her sexual side like Madonna did in Erotica but it just turns out boring.

When Chucky and Tiffany has a plan going to go in the State of New Jersey to see Chucky (a.k.a-Charles Lee Ray's original resting) by tricking two young couples (Katherine Heigl & Nick Stabile) to bring them. Which the couple are unsuspecting newlyweds, leaving murder and mayhew behind them.<br />Directed by Ronny Yu (The Bride with the White Hair, Formula 51, Freddy Vs Jason) made a stand-out horror/comedy/thriller that really entertains. Using the same plot with another killer doll is the highlight of this one, giving Tribute in a way to Bride of Frankenstein. Written by Don Mancini (Who wrote the another three Child's Play flicks) gives it with a good sharp funny dialogue and clever situations makes this memorable one. Only around the end, actually make it almost flat and cold (Giving a Homage to It's Alive). It's enough to love this one, even non-fans to Chucky will find this Likable. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer with an excellent Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Behind the Scenes Production Notes, Traliers, Diary by Tilly and More. DVD could've have Deleted Scenes. Since Mancini mention about at least-An Half-Hour worth of Cut Scenes. This is a DVD worth Buying and the Best of the Child's Play Series. Grade:A-.
B000069AT7|5.0|E.T. is my favorite movie, I've watched it over and over again. On this DVD-set the movie certainly looks & sounds better than ever before. The extras are amazing, too, especially the short feature about John Williams, and the book about the making of E.T. is just fantastic!<br />In my opinion they should have published a version without the 2002 Anniversary Edition though: I have watched it once & I certainly won't watch ever it again. It's quite ridiculous, the CGI looks totally fake & the p.c.-changes took away a lot of the realism ...
B00006CXXU|5.0|outstanding,superb,explosive.3 little words to describe such an large and exciting release.this girl has become a truly wise woman.delivering the goods on all tracks.truly a rare talent.diva signed sealed and deliverd.everything from sleaze,rock soul and the power ballad.my how people change her sound is one that is pure and polished ,after hearing the single &quot;dirty&quot; i didnt know what to expect,boy was i shocked.stand out tracks are &quot;cant hold us down&quot; &quot;impossible&quot; &quot;get mine get yours&quot; and the beautiful &quot;voice within&quot; thankyou Miss Aquilera.......
B00006CXXU|4.0|I bought this cd when it 1st hit the shelves...ive been a fan of christina's for awhile...this cd is very good...no songs really sound alike which is good...very mature sounding...alot of the songs are really inspirational...and of course overall she can really song unlike most of the other pop singers out there...if u're a fan, definitely pick up this cd!!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is great. Fun to watch for child and adult alike. I loved the book and had to watch. Though there are some differences, the movie is very true to the book  (as two hours of visual entertainment can be). I feel they captured the true essence of the characters. Casting could not have been better. The visual effects are fantastic. I love how the game of Quidditch  was brought to the screen and the cute Fluffy....<br />Do your self a favor, board the harry Potter train and enjoy!
B00005ATQI|5.0|I would like to express my appreciation for films that are not just scarey, but so well performed by their stars, so believable, and this one I especially Love because I am a big fan of Jack Nicholson. Without actual &quot;Gore&quot; the movie stayed with me as one of my favorites!<BR>Suddenly, it was decided, I assume by Stephen King? To remake a versian of the Shinning as a mini movie for T.V. I had no way to tape this at the time, but it starred of course different people..and I said, this is never going to make it!! To my shock, it was fantastic!! Starring Steven Weber? His preformance was out of this world! It suprized me, amazed me that anyone could do as well or better than the origonal. I cannot locate anywhere...a copy of this t.v. versian. I would love to have it, can anyone please tell me where I might get a copy???? I would give the T.V. Versian a 10! Thanks...  Happy Halloween....  Genie
630264366X|4.0|But, there are some inaccuarcies.  Such as where Pius XII's actions are minimized and where a concordat of Pius XI is treated as his own.<br />Then there's the scene (I'll try not to give away the plot) where a priest about to be killed, have given Last Rites to himself.
B000000HZZ|5.0|I may only be a teenager, but I know good music when I hear it. And when I bought this (my first Japan CD), I fell in love with it immediately. Me, being a gigantic fan of Duran Duran, found this very accessible and was pleased to hear that apparently when DD were writing their first album, Japan were down the hall in AIR Studios recording this!<BR>Anyway, &quot;My New Career&quot; has to be my fave song ever. It's sweet, and...well...I just like it. &quot;Nightporter&quot; is mellow and melancholy, but definitely the other track that probably had David Sylvian on the way to becoming the gifted solo artist he is now (besides &quot;Ghosts&quot; on Tin Drum).
B000023VR6|5.0|Since the good doctors fine piece of work on the Chronic, Death Row fans eagerly awaited the next Dre album: 2001.  This album has everything; good beats, good rythms, good feature artists and good lyrics.  Many people welcomed Snoop Dogg's place on the album, removing Eezy E and allowing Hittman to perfect the album.  Still D.R.E is in my opinion the best track on 2001, because of it's addictive chorus; Snoop shines on this track.  Another track along similar lines was \\"Forgot About Dre\\" w/Eminem.  An intelligent chorus, good flow throughout and Eminem's hiliarious verse made this the second best track on the album.  One track that I think should been made more of a fuss over was \\"Let's Get High\\" w/Hittman, Kurupt and Ms.Roq.  Hittman and Kurupt both had the typical, hiliarious ho verses with Ms.Roq playing the act of the hoe - her voice bought the whole thing together.  Dre was really on the back seat in this track, and needed to make more of a fuss over himself.  The part he rap, he proved the full potential of his power, concincing and able to keep the beat.  \\"What's The Difference\\" w/Eminem and Xzibit was for me the fourth best on the album.  Again, it's addictive chorus really pulled me in, with Dre and Eminem really making their power of rap shown.  Xzibit was a brilliant feature on this, making his true rap voice heard.  He really is under rated, but both his albums were true works of art.  <br />In summary, the whole album was brilliant, a must have for any true rap fan.  I think the whole fan communtiy is hoping there will be a shorter dealy between this album and the next.  This is Dre's main flaw, he needs to make more music, rather than just featuring and producing.  Dre and Mel Man really did make a good production team on this record - I'm just wondering why Mel Man didn't feature more?  To wrap this review up, buy the album, you won't be dissapointed.<br />Happy rapping.
006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud's \\"Understanding Comics,\\" a creation that sits roughly between comic book and historical literary criticism, is an indispensable work for anyone interested in studying funnybooks seriously.  Along with Will Eisner's seminal works on the subject (which I have not read all the way through), \\"Understanding Comics\\" uses the graphic-text art form to dissect one of the most rapidly growing trends in both art and literature.  In an accessible, readable style, McCloud takes the reader through the history of comics, the definition of comics as a sequential art form involving symbols, and examines several major trends in modern comic-dom.<br />While there's plenty here for both the casual reader and someone interested in more scholarly study.  While it's more of an introduction than an in-depth exploration of comic study, McCloud provides enough resources for someone to continue study on his or her own, and enough seeds to begin sprouting ideas about the funnybooks.  Occasionally, he misses the mark - his definition of art, for example, is a little broad - and \\"Understanding Comics\\" isn't nearly as well-cited as it could be, but these are easily overlooked flaws.<br />Especially beneficial is his comparison of Japanese Manga comics with traditional American graphic storytelling, because the two are basically the same medium but evolved almost entirely independent of each other, until the last 15 years or so.  I wouldn't recommend it for the Sailor Moon fans, but those that enjoy anime and Manga will find much useful information here, in particular the comparisons between the two comic forms (not so much in any actual study of Manga in and of itself).<br />I highly recommend \\"Understanding Comics\\" to anyone who wants to - well - understand comics.  Whether you are interested in the ways Alan Moore tells a story, or want to deconstruct the use of movement in Dave McKean's artwork, or you want to learn why Spiegelman chose certain symbols and styles in his work, \\"Understanding Comics\\" gives the reader an excellent springboard to further study.<br />Final Grade: A-nderstanding Comics\\" gives the reader an excellent springboard to further study.<br />Final Grade: A-
6304076517|5.0|The first movie I was from Peter Greenaway was &quot;The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover&quot;, which I loved for the rich tapestry of the movie, not to mention the offbeat and unexpected story.  Prospero's Books matches the former for the rich tapestry that is presented on the screen.  The story, however, from the Shakespeare play &quot;The Tempest&quot;, is complex, difficult to follow, and over the top.  This isn't a turnoff, however, as I have found that I have continued to gain understanding about the story each time I watch this movie.  This movie mixes multiple levels of reality and dream simultaneously, making your first viewing confusing, but each additional viewing a treat for the mind, in addition to the eyes.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time.

B00003CXZ4|1.0|This is one of these worst moives ever made!!!  If you like watching the same scene over and over and over and over, each time getting a little longer, then you'll love this movie.  The plot of the story isn't bad once you piece this mess together.  The writer and director are under some misguided idea that if we see the same scenes repeatedly not knowing what the hell is going on, we'll get some idea of what the main character is going through.  B.S.!!! This film is unwatchable!  I'm not against movies that make you think or assemble the plot in a piece at a time.  Great movies like Exotica, Crash, and Vanilla Sky are wonderfully crafted storys that stretch your perceptions of reality and make you think at the same time.  Memento is garbage plain and simple!  If you have any taste in movies, avoid this one at all costs!
B000063S6Z|5.0|I bought Moby's &quot;18,&quot; in late September and my opinion from that has changed from the review I made in October. As far as techno goes, and Eminem if you're reading this listen up. <br />Because of &quot;18,&quot; this year definitely has hope. The inspirational 9/11 anthemic ballads, plus the uptempo-&quot;Play&quot;-like jams such as the first two singles (and by the way the album's worst track &quot;In This World,&quot;-is the next signle. That's really too bad, hopefully next it'll be &quot;Sleep Alone.&quot;<br />The uptempo's are 3-a very limited number out of 18. &quot;Rafters,&quot; the sampling of a sounds-like old '60s song, is really somewhat funky/catchy/melodic but &quot;Extreme Ways,&quot; the other uptempo, and the first melodic single &quot;We Are All Made of Stars,&quot; with efforst of blues and rock and slightly ballad-ish blues in the verses, blow &quot;Rafters,&quot; away.<BR>INSTRUMENTALS:<BR>&quot;Fireworks,&quot; is so beautiful that it's hard to not feel the emotion that the flute displays. &quot;18,&quot; is also very pretty with it's violin and instrumentalish vibe with &quot;Look Back In,&quot; the final instrumental lacks what the first too have but is pleasant and yes listenable.<br />So-this is so impressive,<BR>but I'm not finished.<BR>&quot;At Least We Tried,&quot; is a moving Freedom Bremner vocal ballad and has a nice middle instrumental. I can't not mention that. Ooh yeah and for the other very catchy rappish-like &quot;Bodyrock,&quot; as another reviewer (capricornone87) mentioned &quot;Jam for the Ladies,&quot; is another song not short of excellence. &quot;Sleep Alone,&quot; is also very nice and &quot;Another Woman,&quot; sounds somewhat similar to track 17.<br />&quot;Great Escape,&quot; is the album's shortest track at a length of only slightly over<BR>2! minutes. &quot;Harbour,&quot; is by far the longest with almost 6 1/2 minutes.<br />The setbacks &quot;In This World,&quot; the SLGC-featured &quot;I'm Not WorriedAt All,&quot; [which is still a very nice way to close the album] AND also I can't forget that &quot;Habour,&quot; is pleasant but a little too long for me.<br />So all in all the year's best follow-up. You must buy it if you're a fan.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|first, i wanna say that eminem is the best since Pac, his lyrics, the beat, everything is great on all of his cds. he proves us again that he didn't lose the magic touch with 8 Mile soundtrack, and that he is on top of the \\"Rap Game\\". Be sure  to check 50 Cent album \\"Get Rich and Die Tryin\\" cuz he is going to bring something new to the rap industrie and in about an year everybody will know who 50 Cent is. 10/10 this album is great, and be sure to check \\"More 8 Mile\\" that is... it's the second soundtrack on the movie.
B000002MT0|5.0|1. Come<BR>2. Space<BR>3. Pheromone<BR>4. Loose!<BR>5. Papa<BR>6. Race<BR>7. Dark<BR>8. Solo<BR>9. Letitgo<BR>10. Orgasm <BR>With this official last album done for Warner Bros.  Prince walked away, stood as a figure reminiscent of the past at a graveyeard and said I shall have no name, I shall be a symbol, something that cannot be sued.  Come and Space are beautiful.  Prince is special and  this album must;ve worried WB because they kne wit wa smade under duress, displeasure, yet it is good and at teh same time it's a swan song.  So was this his best for them or just a cast off of a genius? LOL<BR>He's a Gemini, it was that, both and more!<BR>Buy it---but at the used price, not a dime to WB for misunderstand that you can't buy or control a man once you have given him enough to be free.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd is sooooooo much better then her debut, Stripped shows howmuch christina has matured!the best songs are Infatuation, Dirrty, and cna't hold us down! so go pick it up it truly ROCKS!<BR>You can see in the pictures that she is naked (don't freak adults it's edited) but who the hell cares? This cd is really a good one to buy! Go get Dirrty and pick up stripped,<br />Saige
B000002U8G|5.0|David Gilmour himself once remarked that Meddle was Pink Floyd's first true album. Though this is their fifth post-Barrett effort, it is musically light-years ahead of any of its predecessors. Of course there are many wonderful, brilliant moments on those early records, but it is clear in those recordings that the band was anxiously searching. Meddle is Pink Floyd finding itself. It is far more focused, far more melodic, and far more cohesive then anything before it. No longer searching, Pink Floyd had finally arrived. <br />The album kicks into gear with the savage instrumental One Of These Days. Howling wind sets the tone as a pulsing doubled bass line (complete with tape echo) pumps along. Intensity grows with organ stabs, reversed cymbal rolls, and fierce slide guitar. After a creepy bass interlude, Nick Mason makes his (distorted) vocal debut with \\"One of these days I'm going to cut you into little pieces!!\\" and slams the song into overdrive. Pounding drums and stinging slide guitar dominate for the next two minutes until nothing but wind remains. It is here that (appropriately enough) the gorgeous ballad, A Pillow Of Winds picks up. Made up of acoustic guitars and sparse bass, this is a beautiful floating piece that takes advantage of Gilmour's tranquil vocals. This gentle mood is held through Fearless, a relaxed mid-tempo summer breeze of a song, again driven by Dave's voice. San Tropez and Seamus show off the Floyd's eclecticism as well as humor. The former invokes a bouncy cocktail lounge jazz feel, while the latter stars Steve Marriot's dog Seamus who \\"sings\\" along with Gilmour on some acoustic blues. <br />And then there's Echoes. 31 years later, this epic sound journey stands as one of the band's greatest achievements. Every element that would become synonymous with Pink Floyd was crystallized in this one phenomenal song. Swirling, bubbling keyboards and liquid guitar lines mix with floating vocal harmonies and a dynamic rhythm section to move the musicthrough several dramatic and powerful moods. Truly the band's musicianship had taken a monstrous quantum leap forward from Atom Heart Mother. Of exceptional note is David Gilmour who, after years of struggling, managed to firmly define his role in Pink Floyd with complete confidence. That he asserts his unmatched talents on this track is an understatement. Fluid guitar lines; silky bends; gorgeous vibrato; subtle slide; tremolo bar antics; funky rhythms; and soaring leads abound. A significant part of his style - playing sounds and textures as well as notes - is also well represented. In the intro, he carresses the strings with a steel slide (much like an E-bow) to produce a shimmering string section-like feel. During the middle section, when darkness falls, his echo-laden feedback cries can be heard over ominous keyboards, swirling wind, and the distant screech of crows. Then, as daybreak comes in the form of a musical buildup to the final verses, the track ends with a multi-layered guitar part that sounds almost like a ghostly choir rising higher and higher. All this over the single echoing piano note that started the piece off. Fantastic. <br />Meddle is often dismissed as a \\"transitional\\" album due to the massive success of it's follow-up, Dark Side Of The Moon. Though it's not quite as perfectly structured as Dark Side, it can easily stand shoulder-to-shoulder with it (and any of the golden era Floyd albums). I would say that if you've digested Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall, move on to Meddle next. This is an incredible album and should not at all be overlooked.
0609610570|1.0|I did not find anything new or original in this book.  The authors start off talking about \\"The Gap Nobody Knows\\" (by Gap they mean Execution) and go on to say that \\"countless companies are less than they could be because of poor execution, and the gap between promises and results is widespread and clear ... as if no one has ever heard about the words strategy and implementation and execution before.  I don't know of a single manager worth his/her salt who hasn't heard and doesn't know about the importance of execution.  The authors try to grab attention by coining and explaining terms like asset velocity which is just another name for asset turnover ... a metric that has been in existence almost as long as accounting itself.  They spend an inordinate amount of time explaining how and why Dell Computer Corporation has a low cost structure and efficient operations - as if we hadn't already heard this from numerous sources over all the decades that Dell has been in business.  They pontificate that \\"unless you translate big thoughts into concrete steps for action, they're pointless,\\" and use negativisms like \\"if you don't know how to execute, the whole of your effort as a leader will always be less than the sum of its parts.\\"  All these are age old ideas already beaten to death in business literature.  I couldn't find anything new or original.  This book might be worth spending your time on if you have never read another management book and don't know how to search for a really good one either.
B00006CXXU|5.0|In the minds of many pop culture enthusiasts today, Christina Aguilera seems to have a split personality problem. Of course, it all depends on who you're asking....If you ask Aguilera herself, the 21-year-old will candidly tell you that what you see now is the real Christina (or Xtina, as she likes to be called) - take it or leave it. What happened to the cookie-cutter, happy-go-lucky popster who liked to sing about genie's in bottles and what not? It was all fake, she explains. The image wasn't her, and neither was the music.<br />Stripped, the highly-anticipated follow-up to her eponymous 8x-platinum debut disc, is genuine, unabashed Aguilera in all her glory - right down to the provocative, semi-nude cover photo in which her breasts are saved from complete wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am exposure by a few strands of well-placed hair. And if this truly is the real Christina, we no doubt have an extraordinary, bona fide talent on our hands.<br />Ray's Rants & Raves:  Stripped contains a whopping total of 20 tracks (16 full-length songs), which translates into about 1 hour and 20 minutes worth of music. Stuffy, conservative critics will complain (some of whom already have) that the record is too long, repetitive, and drawn out for this reason. <br />Fortunately (and unfortunately for those critics), those standards don't apply to Aguilera's musical baby. Every single track on Stripped deserves its rightful place on the record, and you'll probably find yourself repeating many, if not all, of the album's countless gems. <br />What makes Stripped stand out from the confusing, increasingly crowded world of mainstream pop is the sheer amount of stylistic diversity, both lyrically and musically. Xtina confidently flaunts her empowered, no-holds-barred attitude on cuts like the bumpin' club joint \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" (featuring her girl-power partner-in-crime Lil' Kim) and the rocked-out \\"Fighter,\\" where her voice grinds along with the angst-ridden guitar licks provided by Dave Navarro. Elsewhere, she reveals her troubled inner child on the emotionally haunting ballad \\"I'm OK\\" and glides along the gospel-powered waves of \\"Soar\\" and \\"Keep On Singin' My Song.\\" <br />And it doesn't stop there. The facets of the \\"real\\" Aguilera continue to emerge - she coos contentedly along with the laid-back neo-soul of \\"Loving Me 4 Me,\\" unleashes a barrage of sensual come-ons on the smoky mid-tempo \\"Get Mine, Get Yours,\\" and gives us a healthy dose of jazzy Christina blues on \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Underappreciated.\\" She even takes us along for the ride on her road to pop stardom, painting a vivid picture of her journeys in the road-tripping \\"Cruz.\\" <br />But what's a journey without others to share it with? Linda Perry (formerly of the 4-Non-Blondes) allows Aguilera to shine like never before on the forthright ballad \\"Beautiful,\\" and the Alicia Keys-penned \\"Impossible\\" is a masterful slice of 70's R&B that we all knew Christina's pipes would be perfect for. And I'm sure all of you have heard or seen the video for the controversial party anthem \\"Dirrty,\\" which is about as guilty as a guilty pleasure can get. <br />All in all, the contributions - from producer Scott Storch (a Dr. Dre protégé), Glen Ballard (Alanis Morrisette), The Roots drummer Ahmir, and the teams of Rockwilder & Redman and Rob Hoffman & Heather Holley (along with the aforementioned help from Perry, Keys, the Queen Bee, and Navarro) - seem to be clashing and all over the musical map. However, they somehow seem to fit perfectly within the Stripped puzzle in an eclectic, haphazard sort of way. The key ingredient? Miss \\"Dirrty\\" herself. Aguilera co-wrote and co-arranged 18 out of the 20 tracks on the album and manned the reigns as executive producer as well. As if that isn't enough, Christina effortlessly immerses herself in the material while effectively showcasing her one-of-a-kind vocal prowess - minus the overcompensating histrionics that sometimes plagued her earlier work. How's that for justanother blonde, cookie-cutter Britney wannabe with (supposedly) no talent? <br />Ray's Rank: 4 ½ / 5 stars. Go ahead - say what you wanna say about Xtina (\\"Hmm, that X must stand for X-rated! Stank!\\"). She ain't having none of it: \\"Sorry you can't define me/Sorry I break the mold/Sorry that I speak my mind/Sorry don't do what I'm told/Sorry that I don't fake it/Sorry I come so real/I won't let you break me/Think what you want.\\" Think that's being bold? That stuff is only from the interludes. <br />The fact of the matter is, Christina Aguilera is a rare talent, and Stripped is the torch-bearer for her new artistic freedom. It is a groundbreaking foray into mainstream pop (where the teenybopper phenomenon is now declining) and delivers wholesome slices of musical satisfaction to both the young and the old; from the pop fanatics to the punk rockers. Simply put, Stripped is easily one of 2002's best albums and one of the most intimate. And no, that's not because she's wearing next to nothing in the album photo!
0679734767|5.0|\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside).  Along with Mary Wollstonecraft's \\"Frankenstein\\" (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story.  All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.<br />Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is cast in the form of a mystery novel.  Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion.  Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the \\"secret,\\" but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.<br />More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology.  Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write.  Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire.  The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as \\"ape-like,\\" reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.<br />Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible.  Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination.  We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us.  Even if we could not, we can recognize the \\"werewolf\\" in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public.  This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative.  If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it.Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible.

B000068PQ0|4.0|I'm not big fan of the Lips' stuff in general, but this album is terrific.  Initially reminded me of a combination of Dark Side and Beck's Mutations, though I've backed off that bold statement a little.  Anyway, incredible album.
B00003CXDB|5.0|Best financial movie ever?  Perfect direction, editing, and acting.  Excellent storyline and compelling narrative.  Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, the aspiring young trader who wants to be The Big Man, to a T.  This movie does everything a movie should.  It entertains and makes you think without ever becoming preachy.  It never drops down to the left or right wings of economic thought.  On the one hand, Gorden Gecko is the epitome of everything wrong about capitalism, but on the other, he's everything that's right.  He's a greedy SOB, but he works like a demon and built himself up from nothing.  His worldview was perfectly encapsulated in his shareholders speech in which he gave out the famous line \\"Greed is good,\\" and then explained why.<br /><br />You'd think the movie would be a bit dated by the technology and market environment displayed in this movie, but actually the change in times is interesting to observe, and the movie never grows dated because the story is relevant for all times.<br /><br />Another small detail that I couldn't help but love was the gigantic \\"THE END\\" words displayed before the end credits.  This was the style used in the 30s through early 60s movies, especially at the end of tragic tales used to deliver a moral message, and it was a great subtle touch detectable only by movie afficianados.<br /><br />This movie is well worth purchasing.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00006LLNU|4.0|And finally They have returned...!! Sigur Ros is back with an astonishing cd from beginning to end, resuming their charming ways for everyone's delight! Definitely a masterpiece if you consider that the fouth track can be heard during Cruise's diving from the top of the building at the end of \\"vanilla sky\\" so now there you have it!! Also you' d be particularly touched by the sixth track which is simply one of the purest and most beautiful track I've ever heard! Nice continuity anyway from this particular (in every sense of the word) band! <BR>Get ready for an unforgettable trip to the boundaries of dream and delight!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Well, it's true. Christina Aguliera has finally come back. But this time she has come more realer and rawer than last time. Now with hard beats and also some soothing. Not like last time Christina seems to have grown a little out of the Pop phase and is more a Rock phase with a touch of R&B. When I purchased this cd, I knew I'd like it, but it blew my mind cause it was alot better than I thought it would be. Also alot of people are now comparing her new found freedom in \\"Dirrty\\" to Britney's \\"I'm A Slave for You\\", but I now have both \\"Stipped\\" and \\"Britney\\", and sorry Britney but \\"Stripped\\" is much better. Not only does Christina sing about herself getting better, but she also empowers women to do better in this very well made cd. When you rent, buy, borrow or whatever else this cd you'll see that is very well worth the buy, as you'll find it in your cd player for weeks.
6305949980|5.0|This film must've took a LONG time to make. To put it in terms: this runs in 24 frames so the character is posed 24 times for just one second of film and this film is roughly 70-90 minutes but the results look amazing. At times, you gotta ask yourself whether this was computer animated.<br />The story is that Jack Skellington, \\"the Pumpkin King\\" of Halloween Town has just finished a successful Halloween but he's finding it repetitive and redundant so he takes a long walk and finds trees with holiday symbols and he gets amazed by the one with a christmas tree but gets sucked into that world and literally he's floored by how amazing it is and rather than show people the tree, he figures he'll make christmas himself, ignoring a girl who loves Jack named Sally, who has a vision that his christmas will go down in flames.<br />These songs are just too damn catchy for their own good. Written and largely sung by Danny Elfman who supplies Jack's singing voice. And the voices are excellent and really compliment their characters, especially Jack's, he's got a cool voice.<br />As I write this, it's 10/31/02 so it's Halloween so whether you're having a Halloween party or just want a good movie to watch, pop this in.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album shows how much Christina has grown as a woman. All of the songs are great and each song sounds different.  She mixes different genres of music on this album.  Her voice is still beautiful if not better than before. I like how she has empowering songs for young women. I love this CD.
B00006CXXU|5.0|After floods of pop princesses, somebody has the balls to be an individual! I liked her first album, as well. I was one of many that got sucked into the whole teeny-bopper scene. However as all people do, I grew out of it, I am just relieved that Miss Aguilera grew as well. The vocals are incredible, and her new-found artistic ability is simply breath taking. If you aren't even a fan, I suggest getting it. This album is amazing. Great work!

B000067CPX|4.0|Shoot me, but I was never a fan of the Chili Peppers before I heard Californication.  Songs like Aeroplane and Give it Away just never did it for me, but I found a more mature sound on parts of Californication even though the less driving parts of the album just didn't seem to work that well.  Ironically, less driving seems to be exactly the direction By the Way went, and to brilliant effect.  Whatever they changed, they got it right and a lot of the allure of By the Way is how well the album holds together as a whole.  Even though it's pretty long for a rock album, from start to finish it shines at creating an engaging sound.  Favorites of mine include the beautiful Dosed and Zephyr Song, By the Way, and the energetic Cabron.  I only gave it four stars because I wouldn't consider it groundbreaking, but it definitely makes it into my CD player on a regular basis now.
B00006HBUB|4.0|I have to confess that I picked 'Scooby-Doo' out to watch because Sarah Michelle Gellar is in it, and I am a died-in-the-wool Buffy fan.  Had that not been the case I would no doubt have passed it by.  And so I would have managed to miss the kind of utter silliness that somehow manages to entertain and warm the heart.  But be warned, if you have a low tolerance for the utterly ridiculous you may find this film a harrowing experience.<br />The film opens with the breakup of the Scooby Gang.  Velma (Linda Cardellini) is tired of Fred (Freddie Prinz), who always taking credit for her plans.  Daphne (SMG) is tired of always being the one who is carried of by the villain.  And Shaggy (Matthew Lillard)?  Well, Shaggy and Scooby are a bit too focused on food, as usual.  Everyone stomps off in separate directions.  Two years later all meet again in an airport, having been individually invited to help investigate a problem at Spooky Island.  As Mandavarious (Rowan Atkinson) the theme park owner explains it, the college students who frequent the island on holiday are being changed somehow.  He is desperate for help.<br />And so begins a crazy pastiche of monsters, chase scenes, dark rituals, and slapstick meant purely to entertain and amuse.  For the most part made for the young, the film appeals equally to those who recall their Scooby watching youth with fondness or who are willing to set aside all requirements of believability.  Of course, the film is almost entirely action, with only fitful attempts at character development.  For 90 minutes, director Raja Gosnell manages to make sure that there is never a moment when that lacks something diverting to capture one's attention.<br />Initially I was a bit put off but the animation for Scooby-Doo.  But the mind's eye, wonderful organ that it is, quickly makes the adjustment.  The 'making of Scooby-Doo' extra makes quite a bit of the difficulties of acting with an animated character - of knowing where to look and how to react when there is nothing there.  And when you look at the film, the actors' interaction with Scooby is totally natural, which goes far to make it all believable.  In the final analysis, the dog comes very close to running away with the show.<br />The film does have redeeming values, as well as being pure entertainment.  Friendship becomes one of the driving forces of the plot, much more so than it ever was in the cartoon.  One thing I did not care for was some gratuitous crudeness that I feel went too far.  Not doubt this was the reason that the film received its PG rating.  While hardly ruining the film, it detracts from an otherwise very positive experience.hen there is nothing there.

B00005JKCH|5.0|I loved Spiderman! I know it didn't follow the comic exactly, but it came close enough for a movie. The action was cool, the acting was good, Tobey Maguire IS Spiderman, what more could you ask for? It has a great soundtrack also. If you're a fan of the Spiderman comics, don't hesitate to see this movie, it definitely won't ruin it for you. If you have never read Spiderman you won't know any better than to think it's just a really cool movie, so see it anyway!!! This movie rocks!!!
0790725657|2.0|This movie was a big disappointment--it comes across flat as a pancake.  I was dismayed to see the change in the ending, but that wasn't the only thing which was changed.  The whole feeling of the movie was different than the book.  I wasn't even compelled to feel sorry for Sarah, because she comes across as spoiled and superior in the movie.  Her charm and imagination never shine through.  All in all, this picture was just a shadow of the wonderful story Francis Hodgson Burnett wrote.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Great album.The newly released\\"you know your right\\"very emotional and raw I personally can connect with every word.Ive been waiting along time for this song it seems.Also all the other great Nirvana songs come with it.Wow!...

Irreverant and loose, catchy tunes, you'll catch yourself smiling at the nonchalant attitude they project.  Made me think I was in my 20's again.

All the tunes are classic, some written by him, others anyone would recognize like Respect and Satisfaction.  One of those albums that becomes an instant favorite, just a lot of fun to listen to.

B000002U82|5.0|Rock concept albums evolved from the mid-60s to the exquisite works of King Crimson and The Moody Blues, among numerous others, in the late 60s and early 70s.  Since the concept album was still new to rock music, there was a lot of experimentation, with varying success.  Then comes &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.<br />The story is about a man's descent into madness, paranoid schizophrenia, I believe.  As he descends into madness, he has moments of lucidity where he tries to analyze himself and what is happening.  Other times he has visions and dreams that burst into the psychedelic.  Along the way Pink Floyd created songs that were then progressive rock, and are now classic rock staples.  Particular among these is &quot;Money&quot;, which now sounds a bit pop and gimmicky.  However, in the context of the album, and at the time the album was created, the blending of the sound effects and music was a phenomenal breakthrough for rock music.  Not only did they do it once, but again on &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;.<br />The music itself is wonderfully sanguine, deceptively slow, a molasses morass of thick bass contrasting with the lead guitars and occasionally near-operatic voices.  The lyrics too have subtle shallow feel that covers the blue hole of their depth.  The lyrics paint with words and sounds the slow, inevitable descent into madness of a man.<br />It would be easy to dismiss the fourth largest selling album of all time as something it is not.  However, it is the largest selling progressive album of all time, and is not likely to be beaten any time soon.  There have since been better progressive albums, but this one had the combination of art and music that appealed to a broad audience, and helped expand the vista of rock.
B000000I0Q|5.0|Many of the best Prog albums after 1973 were not group works but so-called &quot;solo&quot; albums. Steve Hackett, fed up by his work being excluded from Genesis albums, and taking advantage of the hiatus forced by Peter Gabriel's departure, went into the studio and worked out his frustrations, producing a fine album of extended pieces that were better than any Genesis work that followed.<br />The opening of the album, &quot;The Ace of Wands&quot; is a paradigmic prog composition; meters run rampant, thematic material swoops from mood to mood, minor to major, instrument to instrument, with melodrama and muscular playing depicting this figure from the Tarot deck and establishing Hackett's credos as a guitar god.<br />The album follows through with this form; changes in mood, from acoustic reveries to near-heavy metal shriek fests occur throughout. Phil Collins appears to sing the &quot;Star of Sirius&quot; to good effect. All the songs work in their own way, though they lack the absolute focus of Banks/Rutherford, they still are creditable works.  Maybe it's wrong to think of them as songs and think of them as compositions, which is truer, I think to the actual work and to Hackett's intentions.<br />Other prog solo albums of this time, Squire's Fish out Water, and Jon Anderson's Olias of Sunhillow exhibit similar scope and determination, somewhat familiar to fans of their home bands, but still outside the expected.  Hackett's solo work in point: far more jazzy and frenetic than Genesis' was or would ever be, yet recognizable as part of the Genesis sound world. The joke was on Steve; when he left the band, Banks and Rutherford hired a studio dude to mimic the sound Hackett forged; that's the trouble with a style: unlike mediocre unimaginative playing, a style can be copied.<br />Here is Hackett shaking off the shackles, showing he can out-prog the progiest.  Name another 1975 rock album with this much daring.<br />Well worth your time and money.
0792839730|4.0|There are a number of things which make \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" a classic.  First, look a the cast.  There is no way this movie could be filmed today.  To go through the cast list is a \\"who's who\\" of Hollywood, especially in the 70's.  Second, the amount of time and effort which was put into the movie to get it as historically accurate as possible is to be commended.  While todays moviemakers have the luxery of building tanks and things of this sorts from the ground up, the movie makers for ABTF did the best with what they had.  Does the movei live up to the book, well, yes and no.  The basic outline of the movie does follow the real life story of Market Garden, but there wee a number of things changed for one reason or another in the making of the film.  All in all, a good film.
1559408855|1.0|After viewing this depraved piece of celluloid all you'll wonder is how a film so idiotic could ever be made let alone be released.  Based on De Sade's novel of the same title, a group of Facist kidnap a group of young men and women and keep them in a mansion for a total of four months.  While there they are forced to eat food off the floor like dogs, eat excrement and romp around naked (that's just to start).  The story is told in four different \\"chapters\\".  Each one tries to out-pervert the one that proceedes it.  <br />Is this movie disturbing?  For 1975 yes but not nearly so as its reputation would have you think.  Unless you find sex stories and people crying disturbing.<br />Is this movie any good?  No.  It's not even medicore.  This film is single-handedly THE worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of viewing.<br />I've read where people said that the director wanted this film to symbolize what he thought the Nazis did to his home country of Italy.  What I pulled from this film is a waste of two hours.<br />Unless watching a group of naked men and women cry for two hours is your idea of a good time, I say pass this one up.

0385335482|4.0|This book speaks to all the shopaholic women out there.. which is most of us.  While I could commiserate with the bills piling up, I could totally relate to how she looks at each outfit assessing it the way a magazine does... blouse - Banana Republic, skirt - DKNY, boots - Nine West.  Its was great!  And of course you can help but to applaud when her world finally turns itself right side up!  Its every shopaholics dream come true!  Great read!!
B00003CXS4|5.0|I love this movie! It has the humor and the action! Great plot as well! I think all I need to say is that! BUY IT!
B00001OH7U|5.0|I can't say what the my favourite Bowie album is; that's too difficult. Because David Bowie is so versatile and varied, any of his classics are classics for entirely different reasons. For example, it's impossible to compare Ziggy Stardust with, say, Low, becasue even though they are both by the same artist, they are so dissimilar that comparison is pointless.<br />At best, i could narrow down the finest Bowie albums to three: Hunky Dory, Low and Station to Station. All David Bowie albums, all unlike each other. Each one appeals to me massively for separate reasons, but right now, Station to Station is my favourite Bowie LP of all time because I have just finished listening to it. When i listen to Hunky Dory or Low, they'll be my favourite Bowie LPs of all time for the same reason.<br />Station to Station is an astonishing record, brimming with confidence, rhythm, passion and excitement. I personally don't think that Bowie has ever worked with a better group of musicians than the ones he worked with on this album. Their playing is staggering, full of chemistry, perfect timing. Never is this better proven than on the album's title track, which is, with no hyperbole, one of the finest songs ever recorded. It is my favourite Bowie song of all time, sitting just above Moonage daydream, Quicksand, Life on Mars?, Diamond Dogs, Art Decade, Speed of Life, Heroes and Look Back in Anger. Ten minutes that just feel like heaven. It has a great build-up, with the instruments mimicking the slow, gradual movement of a train, heading for someplace special, and by about five minutes into the song, you're there. The last five minutes of the song are sensational, pure ecstacy, pure magic. There's a moment around eight minutes into it, where the guitars just take me to another level, and it never, ever fails to amaze me. <br />Golden Years, probably the best known song from here, is a supreme slice of glam funk that delivers what was promised but never really delivered on Bowie's previous LP Young Americans, an okay album, but along with Lodger, not up there with Bowie's finest.<br />Word on a Wing features some wildly melodramatic vocals but can win you over if you fall for its spell. This is one of two slower-paced ballads on the album; the other is Wild is the Wind.<br />TVC15 is one of Bowie's best songs, driven along by a superb riff and some fantastic music-hall piano, and this is followed by Stay, which, if it had been released as a single, could have been massive, as it is a very commercial track, very disco, very funky, a hidden gem.<br />Wild is the Wind is a lovely, gentle ballad that is less excessive than Word on a Wing but just as captivating. And then..that's it! Only six tracks! This may frustrate some, but all the songs, especially the first one, are long, and altogether it adds up to the same running time as most of Bowie's other albums. Besides, its quality, not quantity.<br />I doubt I'll ever get bored of this album, it's made far too much of an impression on me to lose its spell. I love it to bits. It gets me in such a good mood. Every time. It's one of my favourites, along with other peaches such as the Stones' Sticky Fingers, Prince's Purple rain, Suede's Dog Man Star (which sounds like Bowie's Diamond Dogs, but even better!)and The Bunnymen's Heaven up Here (plus so many more albums far too many to mention!)<br />If you liked Young Americans, this takes that soul/funk influenced sound to further levels and to far superior effect. No Bowie collection is complete without it. In fact, no collection is complete without it. Just listen to the last minute to Golden Years to hear what i mean; i'd be perfectly happy if that bit went on forever!
0316666343|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Hardly what you would think someone would say about a book about girl who has been raped and murdered, but that is how I found it.  The author resists judging the characters. Through the eyes of our protagonist she simply observes and reports which results in a much richer set of players.  I was particularly moved by her treatment of heaven and how the dead and the living trap each other in `purgatory'.  Ms Sebold does all the classic stuff (foreshadowing, irony, surprise) but it comes across as very fresh it this brilliant tale.<br />I devoured this book reading it on holiday in two days, one night not able to but it down to sleep.  I gave it to my best friend who did the same.  I finished it thoroughly satisfied and yet wishing I had another Alice Sebold book to read.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've listened to it multiple times a day since I bought it.  What a voice!  A real must-have.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I have Christina's first album and did not play it much (very popish) but this one is so much better. Dirrty as we all know has generated so much media attention but the majority of the songs are calmer than Dirrty. Beautiful & Impossible are wonderful songs and the emotion in them makes chill bumps appear on my arms. I tell you this girl has a wonderful voice and demonstrates it on this album. Christina had a hand in writing most of the somgs and many of them give you an insight into her life. I highly recommend this album.

0345339711|5.0|The two towers was a fantasy book. It was my favorite book I have ever read. In the book they explained the lands they lived in and the characters very well. There will also be a movie coming out about it soon. I hope if you read it you like it as much as I did.                                                                                                                                                                                       The thing I liked most about the book was the character. The character I liked the most in the book was Gollem he does not appear until later in the book. There are other characters in the book though. Boromir was my second favorite but he dies right away. The other characters are Frodo, Sam, Arogon, Legalos, Gimli, Pippin, and Merry.                                                                                                                              The book explains every thing very well. I liked the book a lot and the next book I read will be the return of the king.           Well if you want to read a long book that has a good story then this is the book for you. I would only recommend this book to people hew like to read a lot though.
B00005OWEG|3.0|This is my favorite film of all time. I've viewed it over a thousand times when I simply had a VHS copy of it. I received the Redux DVD with much excitement and anticipation. I've watched it once and not again. There are very good reasons for the orginal edit. It loses its focus and becomes an entirely different movie at points. The Centerfold footage and the French Plantation footage are particularly distracting from the orginal cohesive vision. Unless I can program my DVD player to automatically skip the added footage, I'll probably trade this version in for the original edit.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I've been a fan of Christina Aguilera since the beginning. I've been with her through the fashion statements and the false rumors. People criticize her but guess what? I still love her.<br />This album is beyond perfection. I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan but I have to give credit where it's due.<BR>Don't judge her because you didn't like the Dirrty song or video because you will be missing out.<br />Girl power anthems such as \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" targets the criticism women go through when they 'speak up'. There are r&b, blues influenced songs such as \\"Walk Away\\" and the Alicia Keys produced \\"Impossible\\" .. which will leave you with goosebumps like when she peformed Etta James \\"At Last\\" on Men Strike Back 2000 on VH1.<br />She rocks out just a little bit in \\"Fighter\\" with Dave Navarro of Foo Fighters on guitar and \\"Make Over\\". She gets a little soul funky in \\"Underapreciated\\". <br />\\"Beautiful\\" a song that empowers people to know that they are truly beautiful no matter what. <br />Finally there is the eerie \\"I'm Okay\\" which talks about the abuse with her father. <br />Producers include Linda Perry, Scott Storch and Rockwilder. Guests include Lil' Kim and Redman.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix starring Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne is the absolute epitome of \\"the\\" science fiction thriller. Neo (Reeves) is the reigning computer hacker in search of what is called the Matrix. He has been trying to make contact with a man by the name of Morpheus (Fishburne) to get clarity on the search. What Neo discovers, however, is that the Matrix is something that he was always a product of and never knew it. It is not until he is \\"unplugged\\" that he discovers he has been living in a dream world. He uncovers the gruesome truth that the Matrix was plugged into his brain and was sending images to make him believe that life existed as it was. He then becomes a superhuman machine with all sorts of sensational abilities and powers after adapting to a \\"new\\" system that was not based on rules. This is an exciting film with superb action sequences. The martial arts in this movie are absolutely explosive! I must reiterate that this film is \\"the\\" empitome of a classic science fiction thriller. It takes our fantasy to a higher level with pure ecstasy as its climax. The Matrix should secure a slot in everyone's DVD collection. Pure excitement! Kudos!!
B000000WJK|4.0|No overplayed pop songs here, but you will find some of the best down-tempo, psychedelic, atmospheric, and brit-rock music around. I saw them at the Whiskey during that first tour, and they showed us that they could actually pull this music off live too...
B00006CXXU|2.0|I was expecting this album 2 be perfect, but unfortunately Aguilera slips up some. Don't get me wrong there are some good tracks and she has a good voice, but these songs just aren't that memorable!Plus I think she was going for originality on this record, when really, its not original at all!! \\"Impossible\\" sounds exactly like and a Alicia Keys song(mabe cuz she wrote it and prodiced it??) \\"Dirrty\\" is Christina's \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Beautiful\\" is her \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" only Britney's songs are more first class. This is just Christina trying to act all mature. Sure all the critics will probably rave but this cd is not that good...
B00004VWA7|5.0|I was about a year old when this cd came out. I heard it in 1992 just as I was getting into Jazz. Ten years later, and after getting way into Jazz and having gone through a myriad of artists, when it comes to electric bass, Jaco is THE Master. Period. I mean, Victor Wooten and Marcus Miller can play faster and with more technical flash than Jaco, but so what? Faster is not better at all. And besides, after someone has already blown the door of possibilities open for you, it ain't THAT hard. What Jaco did on this album was completely and utterly innovative at the time. No one was even close, not even Stanley Clarke. So, this many years later this album still holds up. Not only was Jaco an absolute bass monster, his compositions are also very unique, and the arrangements (all by him) are great. The masterwork of the ultimate Bass Genius. Period.
B00006LLNU|4.0|Falling squarely into the post rock genre - think of the more spacious compositions of Godspeed You Black Emperor!  and Labradford - Sigur Ros' enigmatically titled ( ) is an ultimately quiet journey, mostly balanced, carefully and skilfully, between elegy and contemplative joy, leaning sometimes one way, sometimes the other, and occasionally cut loose to soar on the wings of both. One might conclude, considering the title and the music together, that it is a recorded parenthetical statement of calm in a world that otherwise never shuts up to listen. Of course, that is not to say that there are no epic moments. In fact there are a few moments of transcendentally epic music that effortlessly raise goosebumps, especially in the final two tracks. In the end, I would still say ( ) is more quiet than not, more glacier than lava flow.<br />A lot can be gleaned from the initial release packaging of the CD alone. The CD comes wrapped in a translucent sleeve of white plastic, with the parentheses cut out to show the booklet's cover image (a silvery black and white picture of reeds along the water's edge), inside which one discovers that there are no liner notes, no lyrics printed on the multiple diaphanous pages of the booklet itself ( - you'll need to visit the official Web site for lyrics and liner notes, which are nicely presented there). The CD itself is simply white.<br />Compared to their previous effort, Agaetis Byrjun, ( ) is truly minimalist in its overall approach while yet retaining the signature stylings developed so beautifully on Agaetis Byrjun. Jonsi's voice, ethereal and at times plaintive, lifts the music to poignant heights some moments while fading back in whispers at other moments to give the music the whole stage. The music itself moves effortlessly from dreamy, almost ambient rifts to truly epic scales and back again. The frequent use of piano throughout much of ( ) is haunting.<br />Ultimately, I decided to give ( ) four stars instead of five simply because, as beautiful as it is, it does not really break new ground in the world of post rock creations. However, I feel somewhat guilty giving only four stars, and want to make it clear that ( ), seen as a continuing effort by Sigur Ros, deserves five in the end. If ( ) is indeed a parenthetical post rock work, then the rest of the text of the genre is better illuminated for its having been made.cause, as beautiful as it is, it does not really break new ground in the world of post rock creations.

059035342X|5.0|Harry Potter is a classic in the making.  This wonderful novel of diversity is a prize for students to learn to overcome the obstacles life may throw at you.  This child who has no sense of being in life manages to find his true identity when he is told he is a wizard.  Once at Hogwarts, Harry forms two wonderful friendships with students that are looking for their own identity as well.  Harry and his friends go on some amazing adventures filled with laughter and danger.  Harry Potter is a great source to study diversity in the classroom.  Harry and his two friends, Ron and Harmonie, come from such different backgrounds, but that does not matter to these three students.  Their friendships is what is is most important to these friends.  I would recommend this book to anyone that wants a book for an adventure, laughter, and a few tears.  Harry Potter is a Ten!

B000002H5I|4.0|I feel like I'm invading her privacy when I hear this music, that I've taken her journal and laid it open.  These are real, remarkably commonplace emotions, what lies buried beneath the dramas that we create in our heads.  &quot;Fast Car&quot; is one of those songs that you wish you had written yourself.  The guitar melody is it's own character, and echoes Chapman's keen, intuitive lyrics.  <br />It's too bad that the term &quot;artist&quot; applies to every mass-produced boy band, heartthrob flavor of the month.  Chapman is a throwback to a time when artists earned their title honestly.  I hope that this vulnerability keeps her in circulation for years to come.
B00006V9A0|3.0|This Album Could Have been much better.There is lots of unused space on the disc which could have been used for many of the great nirvana songs such as drain you,i hate myself and want to die,verse chorus verse just to name a few.They most likely did this to save the songs for the box set which will be released in 2004.But the all the tracks on the cd have been remastered and sound greatly inprooved. Been A Son is from the Blew EP and the last two tracks are from unplugged. <br />This album could have been much better but it is still worth buying for the inprooved quality of the songs/

The adventures of petit nicolas and his \\"copains\\" are very enjoyable. The french in this books is very easy to read something that even a beginner level french student can read. Nothing like a fun book like petit nicolas to boost your confidence in reading french.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This cd is a must have if you never heard any Nirvana song i you have to check this band out.Kurt Cobain music is so differect from other band and this cd is a must have.
B000066NW0|3.0|overall, the cd is pretty gud.  i like the songs, and the lyrics.  i have one huge problem w/ avril lavigne.  though apparently she writes all of her own music, anytime i have heard her sing, she hasnt bin able to keep up with the beat, though, supposedly, this is her music.  she is better than brittany spears, and i grant her that, but, i still think she should  able to sing her own music.  the songs on the cd are ok, though they r redunt after a while.  sk8ter boi is her best, and complicated comes second, as it was overplayed on the radio.  she is better than most artists out there, but i think there r better.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I would say that Spider-man was a good film and definetly worth watching but after watching it for a second time I noticed how bad a lot of the graphics really are. It really lacked some realism but it was still worth watching.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is truly one of the all time greatest. With such great songs. Keith did an amazing job.Mick did very well too. The album is both loved and critisized for its basement production, I love it. It kicks off with the frustrated soundin rocker \\"Rocks Off\\", then moves on to the raving up tempo Rip This Joint featuring a great sax by Bobby Keys and some cool lyrics.Things slow down a bit with a cover of Slim Harpo's Hip Shake, then comes a blusey song called Casino Boogie which features a nice Richards solo and some more nice work by Bobby Keys.The 5th track is considered by many to be the albums masterpiece, Tumbling Dice, with its down to earth lyrics and wonderful rock guitar playing.Next is one of my personal favorites Sweet Virginia. In my opinion it is their best country song.Torn And Frayed is another very good song with a memorable chorus. Sweet Black Angel has a nice relaxing outdoors like feel to it.Then to close the 1st half is Loving Cup which has one of my all time favorite lyrics.To open up the 2nd half of the album is Happy Keith's signature song and what a song it is.Turd on the run is good but forgettable.Ventilator Blues is another very good song and probably most effectavely shows the murky adrenaline of the album. Just Wanna See His Face is what transitions us from blues to gospel.Let It Loose has one of Micks greatest singing performances, and then All Down The Line is one of the album's best rockers.Stop Breaking Down is the only song I've never quite cared for, I don't know why, it' okay I guess.Next however is my personal favorite song on the album Shine A Light.Probably goes along with YCAGWYW as their greatest gospel numbers.I love Micks Vocal and the great guitar solos.Soul Sorvivor follows to close things out well. I love this CD and because of it I am soon going to buy some more Rolling Stone CD's,( Sticky Fingers or Beggars Banquet)
6305165912|5.0|The Dude abides, my friends, and aren't you glad he's out there?    What a mystery today would look like if Raymond Chandler was writing on Orange Sunshine.  Following on their acclaimed hit, Fargo, the Coens, known for strange and offbeat films, on this outing went totally surreally weird.  I confess I overlooked this film initially, despite being a Coen fan, but now I absolutely love it in all its idiosyncratic nuttiness.  Worthy of multiple viewings just to savor the throwaway lines and the marvelously bizarre cameos by the Coen's repertory company (Buscemi, Turturro, Polito, Stormare etc.) and the drop-ins (Huddleston, Tara Reid, Gazzara, Moore & a wonderful Sam Elliott).      The plot, if you think one is necessary, has to do with The Dude (Jeff Bridges), an unreconstructed 60's throwback named Jeff Lebowski, being mistaken for a different, much richer Lebowski, and after being assaulted, his rug micturated upon and stolen (it ties the rooms together, man), begins a labyrinthine pursuit of the kidnapped wife of the Big Lebowski. Which of course, has nothing to do with the pleasures of this picture, which are the sidetrips and the characters, the asides, and the stuff thrown in just because its funny!    Jeff Bridges is perfect as The Dude.  He knows this guy and he is this guy.  The perfect foil to The Dude is John Goodman's Walter, a Viet Nam vet who's a seething mix of outward calm combined with an explosive temper and a penchant for wrong assumptions.  These guys are great together.    Anyway, delineation and explanation is just plain silly for this movie.  Just hop on and enjoy the ride and revel in the fact that the kitchen sink will come flying through at any moment.  There is a complete logic to this kaleidescope, but who cares?

B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink is amazing.You would think of her as just another radio-friendly singer,that is before hearing her album,m!ssundaztood.This album drew me to this amazing artist,and she has become my absolute favorite singer.She puts most of the \\"artists\\" out there to shame with two things-her talents and her music.LISTEN TO ME-don't expect anything when you get this album,just expect to be blown away.Now I love a variety of music from aerosmith to mariah to whitney to nirvana,and the fact that this artist has blown the water out of the competition really means something.Now to get back to pink, let's just say that she has shown an unbelievable amount of growth since her first album-her first album was fun and bouncy,and didn't do much to flaunt her vocal talents, but while this album remains a little green,you really won't believe that what you're hearing is coming from a 22 year old.Singers twice her age don't even come close.Let's talk about her voice.(I saw this girl live,in concert, so there are NO doubts).Her voice is absolutely incredible,unique,raw,emotional,strong,if there were only enough ways to describe that voice.There is no word to describe how she conveys every emotion, every word, every inch of hurt anger or happiness into song.What also amazed me is how she was able to differ her voice in each song.In some songs she reduces the raspiness of her voice to make herself sound relaxed and easygoing.In others her voice is strong and in  yo'face.In others it is raspy and that is where she tears the (...) out of you.Also do you notice that this girl is 22 and writes/co-writes her own music.That's gotta mean something.The lyrics are shockingly confessional very touching,and all in all well-written.Family Portrait (my top fvorite on the cd) talks about her childhood and how her family always fought.But it's not in the spoiled,celf-centered, and insulting way that someone like,say   Eminem would do.Instead it is simply Pink pleading to get a family back.Even if you can'trealate to what she's singing on this track,her voice,the lyrics and the melody will touch u deep.Beat is very sharp as well.And I'm so glad it was released as a single!!In misery, Pink duets with Steven Tyler.They're goin' at some late night blues here.The effect-stunning.Best duet i ever heard in my life.The was their voices blend-ahhhhhhhh-chicken soup-amazing!!Pink demonstartes her vocal ability at it's highest on this track.It takes a while to grow into the song itself,but trust me once you do-you won't stop getting chills down your spine-but before you grow into it, you'll keep listenin' to the song for the part at the end.That's all I'll say.Just Like a Pill is an awesome song which I liked way before it became a hit single.Get the party Started,Don't let Me get Me are feel good songs that would do well on the radio.Eventually,Lonely Girl,and Family Portrait, and Misery are the true gems, and the definitions of pink's artistry.And as for Pink's style-there is NO way to define it.She does not sound like anyone else out there,her style is like slightly poppy rock infused with some soulful r n'b.Ahh, I give up, there's no way to truly define it,you just gotta listn to it.Get pink cuz along with me, u can be proud that u were one of those saying that she'd be around for a long time 20 yrs. later.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I hated Christina Aguilera since 1999, but it all changed as time progressed. I first heard, \\"Dirrty,\\" before it was even offically released. I didn't know what to think but now it is one of the best songs released in 2002, well to me anyway. But even if you liked or hated, \\"Dirrty,\\" it won't matter. The album is nothing like the song. The album suprised me, it didn't have the ballads that dragged on, like the ones from, \\"Christina Aguilera.\\" It didn't even have those polished pop songs like, \\"Come On Over.\\" The album was soulful, and even had a touch of R&B, which I didn't expect. I thought the album was (gasp), actually good! Each track played some sort of role to the album. But for a better look read down for a 1-5 five star review of each song.<BR>1)Stripped Pt.1 - *** stars<BR>2)Can't Hold Us Down - ****1/2 stars<BR>3)Walk Away - ***** stars<BR>4)Fighter - ***** stars<BR>5)Interlude - ** stars<BR>6)Infatuation - ***** stars<BR>7)Interlude - * star<BR>8)Loving Me 4 Me - * star<br />9)Impossible - **1/2 stars<BR>10)Underappreciated - *** stars<BR>11)Beautiful - *** stars (very overplayed)<BR>12)Make Over - **** stars<BR>13)Cruz - * star<BR>14)Soar - * star<BR>15)Get Mine, Get Yours - ***** stars<BR>16)Dirrty - ***** stars<BR>17)Stripped Pt. 2 - ** stars<BR>18)A Voice Within  - ** stars<BR>19)I'm Okay - *** stars<BR>20)Singing My Song - ** stars
B000002BQK|2.0|I love Mariah and most of her music, but I think that this cd is very poor. The only songs woth a listen are butterfly,my all,and the roof which is ok.Outside is the most beautiful ballad I've ever heard in my entire life.Everytime I hear that song I cry. But other than that all the songs are boring,repetitive,or just material that does not suit the amazing miss. carey.

B00006V9A0|5.0|If you are a die hard nirvana fan, then you obviously already have their other albums and all the tracks that are on this Album. But this compilaton gathers all the different moods of Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl's genius, inspirational poetry that captured the lives of millions.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I never did care much for Christina Aguilera. The woman's ability to sing was never truly in question, but the songs she sang most definitely were. I gave her debut a try and found maybe two songs I found worth listening to more than once. This album rectifies that, in spades. It's obvious, listening to this CD, that 'Stripped' was not easy or quick to make, but the resulting eclecticism means that 'Stripped' has a little something for everybody. Aguilera eschews the vocal hysteronics for the use of her powerful voice in subtler ways. Gone are the poppy dance numbers and treacly slow numbers. In their places are self-esteem anthems and power ballads. 'Stripped' is not, by the way, some deeply philosophical thesis. It consists primarily of love songs, break-up songs, lust songs and the aforementioned self-esteem anthems. It is unquestionably a pop album, but pop in one of its best incarnations- imminently listenable, but with enough depth to warrant actually reading the lyric booklet. For anyone who doubts Aguilera's sincerity about leaving the teen pop brigade: ignore 'Dirrty', that supposed call for sexual liberation. Listen instead to 'I'm OK', a twisted lullaby about her father's abuse of her mother, and then try to imagine Britney Spears (who has her own charms, though none as substantial as Aguilera's voice) writing and singing such a song.
B000067CPX|3.0|After John returned to the Peppers for Califoniacation,it looks like By The Way was gonna be awesome. But it sounds nothing like a Chilli Peppers album. Its sounds like they wanna stay on the pop side for now.<br />If your REAL TRUE DIE HARD FAN then check this one out. But if your into there heavly known funk-punk-rap-rock sound, avoid this...
0872860175|5.0|Allen Ginsburg, Jack Kerouac, Lawrence Ferlenghetti, Neal Cassady and the rest of the beats blazed a path across the country in the 50's from San Francisco to Denver to New York with all sorts of stops in between (to include Idaho of all places) and one of the real gems they left behind in Ginsberg's beautiful tome to madness and freedom, \\"Howl.\\"  This is perhaps some of the best language coming out of twentieth century American poetry.  Its a nouveau re-creation of Walt Whitman jacking up the language benzedrine fueled but coming out on the other end not so much as a imitation but as some wholly new, exciting, and electric.<br />I bought this book from the City Lights bookstore, Columbus Avenue, Little Italy, San Francisco.  The bookstore and press started up by the beat Lawrence Ferlinghetti where there were wild at night readings.  I'd recommend it for the experience, but if you aren't in local proximity of Baghdad by the Bay, the very next best thing is getting it right here on Amazon.  It's pocket portable which is an important thing allowing you to bring poetry out where it was meant to be, into the world...carried in a backpack on hikes, carried in a book bag into the city, carried in, well a pocket, \\"dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix.\\"<br />It's a beautiful book with beautiful language.  Don't be slighted by the critics, make up your mind for yourself.  Just listen...\\"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked...who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz.\\"
0767903862|4.0|Reading Bill Bryson is like sitting in a pub with an old friend who has just returned from a trip and listening to him tell the stories of his adventures.  As much as you hope your friend had a good trip, you also hope he had some problems because that is when his story-telling really shines. Whereas travel writer Paul Theroux can be nasty about things he doesn't like  or difficulties he encounters, Bryson tends to look at things with more of a wry smile and he has the true traveller's ability to be amazed at not only grandeur, but simplicity.<br />With In a Sunburned Country Bryson takes us to Australia and it is a great trip through the cities and the outback.  Filled  with anecdotes and comic asides this book is well-researched and well-told. It will leave you wanting to see Australia and to take a trip with Bill Bryson.  Wherever he goes he finds adventure and I would gladly accompany Bill Bryson on a bus to the office because I am sure we would have a great time!
6305095566|4.0|This movie is wonderful.  Very scary (considering it was made in '83) and very gory.  But the gory is VERY VERY cheesy.  So much to the point where its not scary or disgusting. You see two people decompose but its not that nasty because it looks just like clay.  The movie leaves lots of ground to be paradied (Evil Dead II).  A tree voilates a girl by raping her; give me a break.  This movie is very graphic but its not too much.  My grandmother could watch this and still feel ok.  But that doesnt stop it from being a horror classic.  Bruce Campbell is awesome as Ash.  He makes this movie worth the $5 rental fee.<BR>Note - The movie is rated NC-17 but seriously its not that gory.  I mean lots of blood and yea you see this girls tendon ripped out but i mean it looks SO FAKE!  Its really a joke i guess.  Dont let the rating discourage you from buying this because its really not bad.
B00006LLNU|5.0|A sonic, hypnotizing array of astonishing music... Sigur Rs have put together a masterpiece of art. The concept (or lack of) surrounding the album is part of what makes it so incredible: No album title, no track titles, gibberish lyrics, and blank CD booklet. They realized in past albums that different people from all over the world had quite a variety of perceptions of their music. Music speaks to its listener; words are not needed. Therefore Sigur Rs suggests that the listener does exactly this: Make up your own meanings and lyrics. With that out of the way, though, does the music really back it up? My answer to that is, of course--Yes. <BR>Describing the music to someone who has never heard Sigur Rs is difficult. They're a four piece band that has an elegant usage of a guitar strummed with a cello bow, euphoric bass, and outstanding pianos and drums. Listening to it can best do the music sounds, obviously. At first it sounds like a space-rock band, but as the music transpires, it becomes so much more.<BR>For those who have heard Sigur Rs, the music on ( ) is a less polished than gtis Byrjun, which could be looked at as positive or negative depending on your taste. I saw it as a positive. It's more fitting for this album in specific, as well. Another high point about the album is how fluently it progresses between tracks. You can sit and listen to the album completely mesmerized, and time seems to stop. The piano usage on ( ) is some of the most beautiful I've ever heard, especially on tracks 1 and 3. Track 5 is like an inclining roller coaster in slow motion which lifts you higher and higher until its majestic end. The album's string usage is also very well done and fitting to the music. I could go on for days describing how wonderful the songs are in words, but it would never surpass actually listening to it. From the stunningly beautiful track 1 to the jaw-dropping track 8, the music never fails to entrap the listener in a superb flux of loveliness and fascination.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Either you love it or you hate it.  Sure the lyrics of the end title stick with you for a decade  \\"...six of them go to a heavenly spot, the other one goes to a place where it's terribly ...hot...\\", and the \\"plot\\" is twisted, winded, senseless and often optional.  The raid in the last few minutes was exceptionally stupid, and the death of the Well's character was too over the top.  But I really like this movie.  I've read all these reviews of the \\"great\\" sound track with no mention of Herp Alpert & the Tijuana Brass' main title.  A real classic (can be found on their hits album) that's still popular today, long after Dusty Springfield's popularity has faded to, well, dust.<br />Woody Allen, whom I really, really hate, was actually funny in this movie - something that has eluded him the past three decades.  It's campy 60's at its best!  The show down between Bond/Niven and the Highlanders, the killer homing pigeon, and kamikaze car are only a few of the \\"moments\\" this film has to offer.<br />If you like comedy, get it.  The closest think I can compare it to is Blazing Saddles, complete with the senseless ending.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Forget about the parenthetical title or the lack of song names on the album or that the booklet is blank so that you can go on their website and post your own lyrics and images for the booklet.  Just pop it in and listen.  As with any Sigur Ros, a 30 second clip is going to be hard to really get any real idea of the song from, but I think even there you can tell that this is amazing music.  They have set aside some of the sugary string-driven elements from the last album, and it doesn't necessarily recreate Sigur Ros but I think it provides a clearer view of them as a band.  It's great to have Njosnavelin (track 4) on CD finally after hearing various live versions of the song and hearing it in Vanilla Sky, and I must say I was not disappointed with the studio version in the least.  They may not be overly experimental, but I think the album still shows great growth for the band as well as a little bit of a different approach to the music.  And as usual, I think it's great that Sigur Ros can make you forget about all those little review-friendly novelties when you listen.  No matter how much I read about all of these things, when the music starts I'm not thinking about the made-up language this is in or the lack of song titles or anything else.  I just enjoy the music and forget all about all of the talk about how long their songs are.  This album is 71 minutes long but seems to fly by for me as I listen.  That in itself shows that they are succeeding instead of just appearing as some novelty to check out once and discard.
1565847032|5.0|This a great book, which couldn't have come out at a better time.  It almost feels like it's politically necessary right now.  If you read it, pretty soon you'll be trying to get other people to read it.<br />The book combines an easy-going, easy-to-read style with intense documentation in the on-line footnotes (the footnotes are longer than the text, if you print them out).  This gives you the option of reading it casually or treating it like a very serious scholarly work, which it is.  The footnotes are great because they give you extra coverage on topics you are interested in, if you want it.<br />The scope of the book is vast, but Chomsky's brilliance is in his ability to draw connections between a variety of different topics.  The book covers everything from U.S. interventions in the Third World to the machinations of the press, to the decline of social welfare and the war on unions.  But right now the most important sections are those dealing with U.S. foreign policy and the Israel/Palestine conflict.  The treatment of the latter alone is worth the price of the book, because in a relatively brief number of pages, Chomsky makes the conflict completely comprehensible (for me, for the first time...)<br />A lot of the discussions took place in the early 90s and late 80s.  What is amazing right now is how prophetic they've turned out to be.  Chomsky was dead-on about the Israeli-Palestine conflict in 1988.  He predicted back then that \\"the next thing\\" would be a proposal for a two-state solution that would seem good on the surface but in reality would be a situation where one state would be a real state \\"and the other will collect garbage.\\"  His later discussions from when the Oslo \\"peace\\" process was unfolding are equally telling, for he correctly predicts the collapse of the process.<br />The discussions of \\"terrorism\\" are equally brilliant -- so much so that one forgets that at the time Chomsky was talking about Kaddafi and not Osama or Saddam.  It's chilling how things have really not changed much, despite appearances.<br />The book is also very hopeful, giving a lot of advice on what folks can do to change the sorry state of affairs in the world.<br />In all, this is a must-read right now.g how things have really not changed much, despite appearances.<br />The book is also very hopeful, giving a lot of advice on what folks can do to change the sorry state of affairs in the world.<br />In all, this is a must-read right now.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman has written a very important work - important for everyone who wants to have a healthy relationship with his or her spouse.  His premise is simple: There are five major ways in which people receive (or feel) loved.  Thus, they are The Five Love Languages.  Everyone has a love langauage through which they feel loved and everyone can become fluent in each of the five to ensure that their spouse too feels loved too.  <br />When I finished reading this book, I thought that the information it contained should have been common sense.  However, common sense is not so common these days.  Applying this book to ones marriage is not rocket science.  The one barrier we all face is that we tend to try to show love in the way we receive it, which is not always how our spouse receives it.  It takes some work, but anyone can do it.  <br />The Five Love Languages are: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch.  <br />Chapman based these ideas on many years of marriage counseling.  He also examined how love is expressed in various cultures.  Looking at the big picture of human relationships, he derived The Five Love Languages.  <br />In my opinion, every marriage can benefit from the information contained in this slim book.  My wife and I read it together before we got married so that we could start strong.  The prinicples in this book have helped us to understand each other and focus on each other to ensure we are sending message of love that the other will clearly understand.  Give it a try - I'm certain your spouse will be glad you did.
0316666343|4.0|Everybody's dieing to get into heaven, right?  Death sounds like too dear an entrance fee when heaven appears to be an out of body acid trip or a place where most all of your thoughts are manifested.  The Lovely Bones story was the recollection of a murdered fourteen-year-old girl looking down from heaven.  I was immediately shocked, appalled, felt protective, vulnerable...all the things the author intended?<br />     This novel is about how a family deals with the unexpected death of a family member.  In the process of reading of this horrible crime I came to know each family member and Susie Salmon's life and afterlife.  I loved her concept of heaven and how other heavens intersected with hers.<br />     It's quite nice to read comtemporary literature where characters get to be real people.  They're flawed, they're complicated.  They're neither good nor bad.  They just are.  Abigail Salmon was one of these interesting characters.  She was allowed to just be.  She reacted in ways that made sense or intuitive sense to her.  I like that she wasn't judged because of it.  Thank you Alice Sebold for that.<br />     All of the Salmon family were interestingly flawed and complicated.  Susie's dad, Jack was a combination of heroic, perceptive man and timid boy.  Grandma Lynn was the cool grandmother you'd love to have and still the annoying one that embarrassed you a bit.  Brother Buckley was a sweet, inquisitive, knowing child who grew into a frightened adolescent.  Little sister Lindsey was the best of the best.  She was the good student, good athelete, had a touch-of-bad-boy boyfriend.  Perhaps Lindsey is everything Alice Sebold would be in her heaven.  This leads me to believe maybe, just maybe this whole story was intentionally contrived to blur the line between heaven and earth.  The thought occurred when one too may familiar seventies references poppped up.  Like Huckapoo shirts, David Cassidy and David Bowie pins affixed to a book bag.  Initially these references were comforting.  When they became too many they became cliches.  The most disappointingly contrived part was Mr. Harvey's death!  There were far too may pages devoted to Mr. Harvey to literally write him off in a paragraph or two.  I needed more revenge or explanation for the sudden nonchalance.<br />     This is some of the most imaginative storytelling ever.  The details, the events, the end--everything left me feeling trapped in a hopeful perfection.  Everything the author intended?
0790736233|1.0|Will anyone please explain to me why Foster meets her space alien - who turns out to be her own dead father - on a tropical beach? What is this supposed to mean? This film offends just about everyone: science fiction buffs, scientists, atheists, religionists, those who believe in aliens, those who don't, and most of us hoping for alien contact of the Spielberg kind. If you think there's going to be lots of interesting special effects, fast forward the film after the first five minutes to the last ten minutes. This should save you hours of boredom. Also, is this what Carl Sagan wrote? Shame on him if he did! Zemeckis's own Forrest Gump could write a better story! I have a feeling the book ought to be different, but after this movie I'm not interested enough to bother finding out....
B000066C87|2.0|I don't know, but I want to give it a go.<br />My main objection to the film differs from those who had trouble picking up on the conversation, who disliked its rather shopworn depiction of English class warfare, who objected to the murky sound, who were annoyed by the highly stylized ensemble playing by an admittedly brilliant cast; these were merely annoyances for me.  <br />I object to this film because I feel it has neither heart nor soul--it's all surfaces (albeit, slick ones, as one expects in an Altman film), except for a rather nasty view of the human condition that leaks out between the frames.  Are people really as mean-spirited, arch, bungling, stupid, and unlikeable as this sick crew of characters?  Not in my experience.  Could the British class system really have been as dreadful as it appears in this film?  I doubt it.  We get an entirely different picture of English life in, say, Dorthoy Sayers or J. R. R. Tolkien or Evelyn Waugh--one that strikes me as a lot more true-to-life and balanced.  Really, this film is very heavy handed, almost ideological, in its depiction of troubled relations between classes.  Yes, Kelly MacDonald as Mary, Lady Trentham's wide-eyed-but-not-as-naive-as-she-seems Lady's Maid, brings some welcome relief to these morose goings on, but for me it is too little to rescue the on-screen shambles that played out before my befuddled eyes.  <br />Now I'll come completely clean.  I haven't very much liked any of the Altman films I've seen, and generally for the same sort of reasons.  For me, he sacrifices style for content, he has a warped view of humanity, he delights in confusion and misdirection, and he deconstructs without concomitant reconstruction, a formula for unsatisfactory art.  <br />He's just not my cup of tea.
0140067477|2.0|The one message I got from this book was, basically, &quot;anyone can be a taoist if they're stupid&quot;, a message which would grate on the nerves of many intelligent people studying Taoism - and any other philosophical/religous movements. The author seems to take pride in stating - through the character of Pooh - &quot;I am not very clever, ergo I'm a lot closer to the uncarved block than you are&quot;. Spare us! There's a difference between &quot;not being interested in knowledge&quot; and &quot;being stupid&quot;. This book appears not to know the difference.<br />For someone who knows nothing of Taoism, there may be some interesting thoughts in here, but I fear it may leave them with the impression that the only prerequisite for being a taoist is being fick.

0393316041|5.0|This book actually MAKES you want to be a physicist! Feynman recounts his funniest and liveliest moments in his life, from his early days as a kid radio fixer to the world of one physicist. His book is written in an easy, flowing style with no physics nor math weaved into its pages. Extremely colloquial, Feynman thus reflects his light-hearted view on life and his love for physics. This part science/physics/biography of Feynman practically shatters all the stereotypes of the usual scientist. <br />This book, or satire, should I say, not only allows the reader to laugh out loud bad crazy, but to give up reading and devote life to rereading. <br />Richard Feynman [1918-1988] was the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, and 'thrived on outrageous adventures'. This book is the treasured collection of those outrageous adventures, in which one would never imagine to have happened to a single person in a single lifetime. <br />Feynman not only gives the reader a good laugh and a bawdy time, he also runs a semi-invisible commentary on what makes 'authentic' knowledge: learning by understanding, and not by rote; refusal to give up on seeminly unsolvable problems; and total disrespect towards weird ideas that possess no firm grounding in the real world.
B000002TYK|5.0|This is by far, the greatest Foo Fighters Album ever!!!! Yes, their other stuff is good, but not as good as this one. you can't find that unique foo fighters sound any more prodominantly on any of their other albums. I completely recommend this album to everyone in the world.
B00006V9A0|1.0|With a wife like Courtney and bandmates like Krist and Dave it's no wonder Kurt felt alone in this world.  Now that these 3 are collaborating on making money off a guy who had so much integrity he killed himself cause he believed he was becoming a fake Rock Star, I hope everyone can see just how despicable this is.  NO, NO, NO, Kurt would not have been happy about this.  He would not be happy that his last studio recording is being used to sell a greatest hits collection that serves no purpose other than crass commercialism - THAT should NOT be Kurt Cobain's legacy.
B00006NSZ5|1.0|I can't belive i spent my money on one song. The ony good song on the album is loose yourself. The rest of the stuff is just plain pathetic 'cause it is overproduced and they try so, so, so hard to be hard core, when really those rappers live in like 10 million dollar mansions. I just ain't feeling this one.
B0000696I1|2.0|Oh dear, if you're diabetic then I would seriously advise against watching this film. It' so sugary it'll rot the brain right out of your head.<br />Why on earth Eastman and Laird allowed this to be made is beyond me. It's soooooooo far removed from their black and white comic book. Okay, I know the cartoon series was too but the first movie did have a hard edge to it. I mean, take a look at the cover-the Turtles are smiling and happy. Then look a cover of one of the original comic books. They're almost always gritting their teeth and frowning. THAT'S how it should be. Not like this.<br />Even the animatronics look fake. The first 2 had a rather believeable Splinter but now he's juddering and stiff and obviously operated by a couple of technicians loitering a few feet off camera. His voice is also totally different and he seems a touch more upbeat and lively. HARDLY the way Splinter is supposed to be.<br />The plot itself defies logic and there are massive holes all over the place. With such a dramatic change in locale from New York to Fuedal Japan you'd think the movie would take advantage of that and go nuts with imagination.<br />But sadly not. It just...goes nowhere. I mean, what is the deal with the character of Whit. Why does he look like the great, great, great grandfather of Casey Jones.<br />In fact, the return of Casey is the only reason I am not giving this a 1-star rating. It's a pretty wretched movie but Elias Koteas can make it a tiny bit less unbearable.<br />Hopefully the new cartoon show and the possibilty of another (harder) movie will cancel this one out. It's nothing but dated, mindless fodder for under-fives. At the risk of repeating myself; this is NOT how the Turtles shoud be.<br />Extras are almost non-existant but the animated menus are cool. The 1.85:1 anamorphic picture is in pretty good shape but the Dolby 5.1 track isn't up to much I'm afraid. The film was orginally recorded in Dolby SR so this is obviously a remastering job. It's just adequate is all I'm saying.adequate is all I'm saying.

B00006LLNU|5.0|The first thing you notice about this album is the beautiful packaging and the fact that, when you open it up, you see the liner notes are ten pages of blank paper. Well, not quite blank: because given the absence of any text the faint designs on the paper, which otherwise you would have dismissed as part of the stationary, become a sort of minimalist art themselves; and each page is different, once you start looking closely enough. Which is of course a metaphor for the album's music itself. Not only is there no 'real' album title and no track titles at all, all the songs are sung in 'Hopelandic' so I don't think there's anyone in the world who'll get distracted by the lyrics. Instead, you have to just close your eyes and sit back and listen to the music slowly wash over you. And it is slow--none of the albums songs is any faster than around 70 beats per minute. But even with that slowness, and with the fact that what development the songs do have is so gradual as to be practically imperceptible, you'll find yourself looking up to find that three tracks and twenty minutes have passed by, without you noticing. That's how absorbing these tunes are.<br />Of course, not everybody'll like em. The difference between each of the eight tracks on the album isn't, to the superficial ear, that much more than the difference between the 'blank' pages in the liner notes--'drop the needle' on the middle of each song and you'll most likely hear Jónsi Birgisson singing something that sounds like 'you sigh.' And if you're distracted the music can easily slip into the background and become something like sonic wallpaper, since it doesn't have a single pop hook to keep you in.<br />But when you're willing to actually listen, it's that absence of hooks that makes the music so beautiful and engaging. Despite Sigur Rós' 'orchestral' characteristics, they don't rely on dramatic crescendos and orchestral bombast (well not much) to get their point across. Instead the key to their music isnothing more than the inexorable progression of their chords: it's not all obvious, and few of the chords are quite what one might expect, but it each one has an undeniable 'rightness' to it. The only thing I can think to compare it to is the music of Albert Ayler--he obviously played in a completely different style, but his bands had a way of setting up tensions and resolutions in their music that, despite their avant-garde setting, seemed to tap into something at the very heart of how we understand music. And Sigur Ros is the same way. The comparisons with the glaciers and volcanoes of Iceland get overdone, but it's impossible not to see why they arise. The music in ( ) does seem to share something with those primal forces, like it's less created than revealed. And it's really good. Check this album out.
B00006V9A0|1.0|There's really no reason to buy this cd. If you like Nirvana you probably already have all the songs on this cd already. If you don't, then do yourself a favor and buy the albums the songs first appeared on. The only reason I could see to buy this cd would be for You Know Your Right. But since the money obviously isn't going to Mr. Cobain, and since everyone around him have been acting like greedy, squabbling idiots, I see no reason you shouldn't just steal that track off a file sharing program.(and it is stealing). And while your on there take a listen to some other rare songs that can't be found on a release, such as, Moist Vagina, Sappy, Clean up Before She Comes, and Opinion. They're all worth a listen
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is Christina's most mature album to date. She co-wrote and executive produced this album and did a damn good jop at that. Ballads like 'Walk Away', 'Impossible' and 'Beautiful' really show off her unique and amazing voice. While rockers like 'Fighter' and \\"Make Over' kick some serious .... Another stand-out track is the acoustic guitar driven, tear-jerker 'I'm Ok' about her fathers abusive behavior. Stripped combines many different genres into an eclectic, personal masterpiece that Christina should be very proud of.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This new CD is amazing! Filled with inspration and pure fun. Christina Aguilera is back! All the songs have been given 100 percent and its worth buying this cd.
B00005JGAF|5.0|I bought this on vinyl. On tape. On CD. Now I've bought it again on CD -- and the remastering and the bonus tracks are worth every penny I've spent on this title since the '70s.
B000069CWE|5.0|I may be biased since I love Linkin Park<br />(pushmeaway.com) and I love remixes but<br />this album is seriously really good.<br />Track 6 - P5hng Me A*wy is much better<br />then the original version on Hybrid Theory.<br />Other faves include Track 11 - Wth>You,<br />Track 15 - My&lt;Dsmbr and Track 17 - By_Myslf.<br />The only negative thing I have to say about<br />this album is the new spellings of the songs<br />and that's only because it's hard to remember<br />them when writing this review :)
B00005JGAF|5.0|I bought this on vinyl. On tape. On CD. Now I've bought it again on CD -- and the remastering and the bonus tracks are worth every penny I've spent on this title since the '70s.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|The 8 mile soundtrack is a dark and mean kinda look at coming up in the rap game. Slim himself is on about 5 tracks, one of them is a 3 minute song without a chorus. Other people have really hott tracks like Rakim, 50 cent, D12, Ganstar and others. What makes me not give this cd a 5 star is the apperance of macy gray and boomkat, they kinda take away from the rest of the album. Its kinda wierd listening to xzibt talk about 9/11 then hearin macy gray.  They take a couple of shots at some rap stars such as Ashanti, Charlie Baltimore and Dangelo. Alltogether this is a really good cd, its allmost another eminem CD.
B00006HBUB|1.0|You are better off watching the Scooby Doo cartoons on TV. I rented the movie since when younger I used to watch the Scooby Doo cartoons and enjoyed them, I was also told that the movie had very good special effects. To make a long story short I fast forwarded most of the movie, My wife and my son did not finish watching it.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I've loved Nirvana but when Kurt Cobain died ...I thought that was it, no more new song. Well i knew there were going to be stuff like \\"spank thru\\" and live stuff but i never knew anything about \\"You know your right\\" its a great song i think every one who liked \\"Smell like teen spirit\\" they will love this CD. ...But buy this cd it is worth the money.
B00005ATQD|1.0|What a waste of time. They must have offered Tom And Nicole a lot of money to start in this garbage. I continued watching the movie hoping in would get better. boy, was I wrong. Althought i will admit it has a couple of very sensous scenes, but still not worth wasting your time and money.
6305180261|5.0|this video has it all folks, the raw hard rock, the beautiful, moving ballads and just about every well known guns n' roses song out there!Bang your head to welcome to the jungle, paradise city, live and let die, the garden and dead horse. Light up your zippo's and start swaying to sweet child o' mine, patience, dont cry, november rain, yesterdays and estranged. You can even satisfy your darker side with video's like Garden of eden and since i don't have you. There is tons of live footage and this is an absolute must for any GN'f'n'R's fan, hell any fan of rock who wants to apreciate a point in time where rock was it! rock on boys and girls, buy this video.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|8 Mile Soundtrack, has to be one of the nicest soundtracks out in a long time. In the movie Eminem is the the main actor, and the story is similar to his life story, and his long rise in the game. The soundtrack is laced with loads of rap talent, old and new, with Ems group D12, 50 Cent, Nas, Jay-Z, Young Zee,Gangstarr, Freeway, Macy Gracy, Boomkat, Obie Trice and the legendary Rakim all making appearances. The album opens with the lead single \\"Lose Yourself\\", Eminem verses.. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow; this opportunity comes once in a lifetime.. to the background guitar riffs which gradually rise throghout the song.  Eminem is passing the message, when the opportunity comes, you better dam will grasp it, track is very powerfull. This is my favourite track on the  album.\\"8 Mile\\" and \\"Love Me\\" Feat. 50 Cent and Obie Trice follow and are nice tracks. On \\"8 Miles and Running\\" Jay-Z and Freeway drop a deadly combination. Macy Gracys \\"Time of Your Life\\" brings about a change in sound, produced by Dante Ross, as does Nas \\"U wanna be Me\\" another blazing track where Nas kicks insightful knowledge. Hiphop Legend Rakim who is making a commeback appears on \\"R.A.K.I.M\\" and flows nicely, letting you know he is still very much in the game. Gangstarr appears on \\"Battle\\" produced by DJ premier. 8 mile soundtrack is really a show of Shady Records talent and Eminems beats but succesfull tracks by big names like Nas, Jay-Z and Rakim all raise the quality of the album. Blazing soundtrack, worth checking out.
B00000099Y|5.0|this is positively some of the best heavy metal music you can <BR>buy! so if your into this get it because I guaruntee that you'll<BR>like it. keep it coming TOOL!
B00005JKNF|4.0|It takes a while to figure out who everyone is and their relationships with each other, after all it is an ensemble cast of over 30, so watch it the first time through to find out \\"who done it\\". Then watch it again and again to really figure things out and to pick up on all the wonderful details that you missed the first few times. The trailer seems to lead you to believe this is a comedy, but it is a first class drama that hapens to revolve around a murder.<br />And yes, Jeremy Northam does his own singing in this movie and displays a lovely tenor voice that was really surprising.
B000066NW0|4.0|Yes, we've all heard &quot;Complicated&quot; 10,000 times on radio.  And now we're approaching 1,000 spins of &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; as well.  Don't let the corny lyrics of &quot;sk8ter&quot; fool you into thinking Avril Lavigne is some kind of Teeny Bopping Queen.  That couldn't be further from the truth.<br />When you have an impression of something or someone, you tend to get that idea stuck in your head, and pre-judge.  I don't mean to preach, but that's what's wrong with America today.  We judge.  This album is worth a listen, because you'll be surprised.<br />&quot;Let Go&quot; reminds me a lot of Alanis Morrissette's &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; album, which was a multi-platium seller, with tons of hit songs.  This album by Avril Lavigne could very well do just the same.  There are a bunch of songs on here that are remarkable, but might not be able to fit in on TRL.  If it's packaged right, this girl can pull of anything.  She's got something intreguing about her, and it shows in her music.  She's going to be big if she can stay level headed, which I'm sure she won't have a problem with.
B000002L5P|5.0|What can I say? This album is great, like any other Smiths album. Go and buy it if you listen to good music.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Typical John Woo film. Minimum story; maximum blood.<br />As in Face Off, Woo sets up personal conflicts, moral abiguities, conflicts of duty, friendship, loyalty and emotion. Then develops none of them.<br />This could have been a masterpiece on par with Private Ryan or Thin Red Line, but ended up being a WWII version of 3000 Miles to Graceland.<br />Yes war is about senseless violence and death, but this movie was billed as being a story about the Navaho Code Talkers.<br />I was hoping for a film that was actually about the Navaho Code-talkers. Unfortunately this was not it. Yes it did feature a code-talker or two here and there but it was more about explosions, blood and flying bodies. Not as some reviewers claim war violence but the worst of Hollywood's stylized over choreographed nonsense.<br />Woo kept forgetting that the mnovie was supposedly about the Code talkers, then would suddenly remember and throw in a few seconds of a Navaho yelling into a radio, then back to the gore and explosions.<br />The explosions were not even realistic. I am sorry, but hand grenades do not produce 10 foot fireballs, Thompsons do not fire at 1800 rounds per minutes and .30 carbines do not throw their victims back through the air when the round hits.<br />As in \\"Face Off\\", John Woo took an intriguing psychological concept, dropped the concept in midstream filled the rest in with unrealistic and excessive violence.<br />I found this movie very tiresome and had I seen it in the theatre I would have most likely have walked out midway through the picture. With the DVD it took me 4 sittings to finally bull my way through it.<br />If you want a proper war movie get or see \\"We Were Soldiers\\"<br />Don't waste your money on this mess of a nonsensical movie.
0385720920|3.0|The movie Fight Club got me interested in Palahniuk, and I loved the book.  Choke was next on my list, and although it wasn't as good as Fight Club, it still has it's shining moments.  Palahniuk has a gift for time and place, and his characters weave through their intricate situations with grace.  <BR>I loved the main character, what with his sexual addictions and bizzare, if farfetched scams.  I was quite caught up in his trials and tribulations, enjoying his reactions to the insanity surrounding him.  Very entertaining!<BR>It's true that Palahniuk is great with sardonic wit and dark irony, and his masterful use of those skills push Choke a step ahead of most modern novels.  If you liked Fight Club I think you will like Choke as well.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is the best thing I've heard since Alicia Keys won all of our hearts over with her debut song \\"Fallin\\" in 2001! Not to mention this CD has alot of the same blues flava, it also combines pop, rock, hip-hop, jazz, and r&b! For all of those out there who have wasted money on buying a whole CD for 1 particular song...this album is it! Every single song on this album is excellent and easy to relate to...especially all you ladies out there! If your still not convinced I must say I wasn't to impressed with christina's first album but now I think shes had some time to get herself together and take control like a woman should and show the world what a talented, powerful, sexy,and REAL woman she can be!!!
B00005QGAV|5.0|Dangerous,wow. This is really a great CD. One could only imagine what this CD was going to do on the charts had not that child molestation levied him. Michael and Teddy were wonderful together. Some of Michaels best dancing. Best lyrics and music was featured on this CD. <BR>Another must have. Infact I recommend all of his CD's up to Dangerous.
6300267938|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but was not sure why.  After reading every review,I can say that it was all of the previously mentioned aspects, the cast, story and scenery played out in a gripping drama.  It held your attention.  I guess it helps to really like the cast.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Before the scandal, before the media bashing, Michael sings with an innocence and crispness that is unimaginable. This will always be a classic and will be forever. His Ballads, Lady in my Life, Human Nature and PYT are sung with such sweet sexiness, that unfortunatley that has been lost today. Billie Jean, Beat it and Thriller. What more is there to say. <BR>The album speaks for itself.<br />To really appreciate Michael, his talent and his work one would have to go back to the 'early years'. Thriller and Off The Wall are the 2 off the biggest highlights of his career. I never get tired of playing cd. <br />This is a must have for every CD collection.
B000069AUI|5.0|This cd is truly one of a kind. I remember hearing it on AOL back in August a week before it came out and I loved it then but didn't get around to buying it until yesterday, and frankly I had forgotten how wonderful this album really is and I wished I had decided to buy it a lot sooner. It has some great rockers and some sweet slow songs as well, and Chris Martin's voice is just achingly beautiful. I love music just about more than anything and I am very picky about what I listen to, and I can honestly say that this is one of the very best albums I've bought this year. Just wonderful and very highly recommended. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Let's get the obvious out of the way first.  This is an album fertilized in a field of pain, alienation, and anomie.  There are good arguments for the proposition that spiritual and emotional lows sprout art of the greatest depth and profundity.  They can also lead to self-destructiveness or even suicide, and there is a bit of Kurt Cobainishness going on here, a plaintive cry from an artistic and personal wilderness that is both mournful and resigned.  I can only hope that Beck's unleashing of Sea Change is a purgative, and that he will find enough of a mooring that I won't have to worry about seeing his name in the headlines soon.<br />Let's start with the strongest track, Paper Tiger, where he growls:  \\"Just like a paper tiger; torn apart by idle hands; Through the helter skelter moment, fix yourself while you still can; No more ashes to ashes, no more cinders from the sky; Let all the laws of creation, tell a dead man how to die.\\"  Punctuated by fluid guitar riffs, and building later to early Elton Johnish strings, this may be the best song on the album.  I would love to hear this song as a quite accoustic piece, since the strings sometimes overwhelm as song builds.<br />Other Standouts:  \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine,\\" \\"Lonesome Tears,\\" \\"Nothing I Haven't Seen,\\" \\"Round the Bend,\\" and the list goes on an on.  Almost every song is an elegant dirge with lyrics that run as deep as you care to dig, and melodies that resonate like familiar friends.  Just a snippet ought to give you a taste of Sunday Sun, a joyous, XTC-like suggestion that there may be warm, golden rays of hope flooding into Beck's exquisitely appointed musical room:  \\"Haven't got a lot to learn, And my eyes, they stray again; Looking for a satellite, In the rays of heaven again; There's no other ending Sunday sun, Yesterday's are ending, Sunday Sun.\\"  And against that elegant, elegiac accoustic guitar riff we can almost feel the warm, gold rays dancing in a glassy solarium temple to relationships yet to come.ome.
B000001EHS|5.0|Wow, this album rocks. I had some of the Def Leppard albums in college, but they wore out. I got this album as a replacement and it is great. All my favorite Def Leppard hits on one album. The recording quality is great. I might have arranged the songs in a different order, but there is not one that I disagree with being on this album. Cranked loud, it shows the greatness of the band (my favorite band is still Pink Floyd, but this band knows how to rock).
B00006690G|5.0|Ok, everyone, it's about time that people put aside their doubts about Eminem's skills or staying power!  Slim Shady's third album, \\"The Eminem Show\\" proves once and for all that Mr. Mathers is extremely talented, in addition to being a lightning rod for controversy.  With his debut album in 1999, \\"The Slim Shady LP\\", it would easy to have written him off as another white rapper being a pretender to the throne of hip-hop greatness.  Even with catchy songs like \\"My Name is\\" and \\"Guilty Conscience\\" making loud noise on the Top-40 charts, critics were in a hurry to lump him with other 'Great White Hopes' that flamed out like Vanilla Ice (just a complete joke) and Snow (just never found an audience).  The success of his sophomore album, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" shocked many and showed he had staying power, but the truth is, Eminem was destined for success from the start.  <BR><BR>   First, Eminem is a gifted lyricist and free-stylist, which already separates him from the pre-fabricated hip-hop garbage like Ja Rule and such.  Second, he made the crucial decision early on to ally himself with arguably the most respected and skillful name in the hip-hop world, Dr. Dre.  With Dre's expert and ORIGINAL sound backing up Shady's vocals, it was inevitable that he would be successful and that eventually people would come around to realize his talent.  <BR><BR>   \\"The Eminem Show\\" continues to show the evolution of that talent.  \\"Without Me\\" captures the same fast-paced, light-hearted slams at popular culture that \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" did on his previous album.  In addition to such 'amusing' songs like that and \\"White America\\", Eminem delves deeper into, and makes some peace with, his sordid past.  \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" goes right to the heart of his pain about his upbringing and his fractured relationship with his mother.  If his lyrics in this song are indeed and accurate depiction of his life growing up, then it's no wonder he's such an angry individual.  Yet, through that anger, he seems to be making peace with himself, even if it means terminating any relationship with his mother.  It's gritty, harsh, but real material.  <BR><BR>   Eminem is branching out into movies now with a loosely autobiographical \\"8 Mile\\".  Early reviews there seem positive, too.  It's always fascinating to see what he will produce next.  The controversy he generates grabs people's attention the first time.  The skill and talent that he displays keeps people returning each additional time.
B00006G8G4|5.0|This collectors edition DVD set is awesome! The actual film cell is amazing. It is the scene where Spidey, in the burning house,  is dodging the Green Goblins flying blades(one of the best parts in the movie). The box that the set comes in is very nice. this is well spent money for fans and non fans alike.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Sigur Ros' first album Agaetis Byrjun is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I loved the foreigness of the sound with the comforting Icelandic language. Now with ( ) Sigur Ros goes a step further by inventing their own language for this album known as &quot;Hopelandic&quot; This album is sheer beauty, much like their last one and will stir emotions inside you. This will undoubtly be on every music critic's Top 10 albums of the year list. Keep an open mind and an open heart and I'm sure this album will be treasured.
0790749815|5.0|Great thriller.  Hitchcock really knew his stuff.  Why can't they make movies like this anymore?  You really didn't know what was going on or who was on the good side till the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Roger Thornhill gets pulled into political intrigue when some creep mistakes him for the non-existant James Caplan.  Next thing he knows, he's kidnapped, arrested for drunk driving, framed for murder, chased around on a train, crop dusted and then almost falls off the side of Mt. Everest.  Poor Roger Thornhill.
0790731002|4.0|This was an above average movie, but could have easily been the best of the Batman series. I have a few problems with this movie. One: NIPPLES ON THE BATSUIT. What the ... was that there for? Two: TWO-FACE'S CHARACTER. They should have used the black and white suit from the cartoon instead of a red and white zebra suit, with an leopard tie and spiked shoes. It's just too colorful, which leads me to three: TWO MUCH ... COLOR. What was Gotham supposed to be, Las Vegas? Note the word \\"goth\\" in Gotham. And also, there was never a clear sky day in the previous movies, why was it that way in this one? Finally: THE MOVIE WAS JUST PLAIN SILLY. Cartoon sound effects? The childish dialouge? The villians' insane, forever lasting laughter? And what was with those 1940's cars and music? This movie should have been the best yet Batman but instead slides in at #3. But compared to the next Batman this one is \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\".
B00003CXI1|4.0|Having seen the movie in the theater, I was expecting the DVD to be the same experience.  Surprise, seeing the movie for the second, third, and fourth time, only brought out the special effects even more.  An entertaining, and clever movie that is fun to watch with the whole family.
B00006JSS8|4.0|All I have to say is this cd includes all of the huge hits people have come to know and love minus a few....it takes the listener on a journey through Stevie's humbled beginnings as an artist to his worldwide acclaim and influence of today....go get it!
B000067DNC|5.0|This DVD set is an excellent addition to my season 1. I only would wish they come out with the rest of the seasons QUICKLY!<BR>The episodes on the DVDs are an excellent way to see how the series are today. Episodes are creative, great special effects and really makes you think! <BR>BUY IT NOW!
B000002TQB|5.0|If you buy one Blur album, this should be it. So diverse and ahead of its time, Parklife is a musical wonder. Sure, there are the expected campy songs that we've come to expect and love from Blur, but there are also the thoughtful dark tracks like &quot;Low&quot; that really complete this musical experience. Buy it. Live it. Love it.
0792833201|5.0|This was a great movie, scary and with an incredible plot.  It is very scary, and was originally rated R, but when the movie's crew complained, it was lowered down to PG. Still, I would consider or watch this movie before letting a child under 13 watch this.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is a great album, but only because Beck sounds JUST LIKE GORDON LIGHTFOOT--eh? Lightfoot rocks! Thanks Beck for recognizing us up in the Great White North. But please no Celine Dion.
B00006V9A0|5.0|And I'm glad we finally did! Its been 8years since kurts death and this brings backs the tears of his death, but also the smiles of the good old days! Its has alot of good songs on it of their, with their new... song YOU KNOW YOUR RIGHT. It could've had more of the hits of theirs on it, but the one that are on it are great! R.I.P. Kurt, c'ya, and buy the CD!!!
0783229526|5.0|this film is a misunderstood classic, but it will be available on the criterion collection label so wait for that.
B00006ADG8|5.0|As another reviewer stated, this film is as close to perfect as a drama can be. It is an unbelievably moving story about law and justice, and about what it is that makes us human. You will never forget this movie after you have seen it. It is Peter Ustinov's finest film as a director and that is why it is a tragedy that this movie has not been released on DVD in widescreen as it was intended to be seen.  Absolutely and unreservedly recommended.
B00004XONN|4.0|If you liked Low or Heroes from David Bowie at all, then you will probably have more than just a passing interest in this CD.  Also, if you like Kid A, check out the afforementioned CDs or even Earthling from Bowie.  All of these contain some really forward-thinking sounds and ideas.  Treefingers could be placed right along next to Moss Garden and fit in seamlessly with the rest of Heroes.  <br />This is a very meditative CD, probably not what you want to play at a party.  This is more of a disc to listen to while working, driving, or any other occasion when you have a good block of time to dedicate to listening to Kid A in its entirety.  <br />I'm a big fan of &quot;continuity&quot; albums, things that you can listen to from start-to-finish and come out feeling like it all belongs together.  Radiohead has definitely accomplished this, and Kid A, along with O.K. Computer, will probably forever be favorites in my road trip CD wallet.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I hoped for this movie to come outin DVD but I was disapponted that it was not in DTS sound format??? What is the problem the movie came out with it But not on the DVD not to cool for SONY to do that.
B003DZX44I|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have seen \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" more times than any other film. It was by far my favorite when I was a little kid. I was six years old, and getting the VHS for Christmas in 1992 was one of the best presents I have ever received. I was so enthralled by this movie. The animation, the songs, and most of all the story enraptured me. And I had so much \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" merchandise, it's insane. Pizza Hut dolls, a Beast stuffed animal, a board game, and Velcro shoes with Belle and The Beast on them. Yes, they were technically for girls, but I didn't understand that. (I was 6 years old.) They were \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" shoes, and I wanted them! Anyway, I have a long 18 year history with \\"Beauty And The Beast,\\" and it may just be my all-time favorite film. I have absolutely no criticism for this film. In my eyes, it's perfect. When I got the Platinum Edition DVD in 2002, I realized what a truly great film \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" is. The animation in the ballroom sequence is groundbreaking, Alan Menken's score is fantastic, and Howard Ashman's lyrics are brilliant. Take the song \\"Belle,\\" for example. You learn all about Belle, her relation to the townspeople, the town itself, and Gaston's desire to marry Belle. \\"Be Our Guest,\\" \\"Something There,\\" and \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" are musical and lyrical works of art.  The voice talent is incredible. Paige O'Hara (Belle), Robby Benson (Beast), Jerry Orbach (Lumiere), Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Potts), David Ogden Stiers (Cogsworth), and Richard White (Gaston) are all perfectly cast. Paige O'Hara brings a wonderful intelligence to Belle, and Robby Benson is superb at vocalizing the Beast's inner torment. In fact, I have an autographed picture from the film signed by Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson that I got as a gift from Walt Disney World that I just cherish The animation is also wondrous to behold. There is something about hand-drawn animation that computer animation can't quite match, in my opinion. The characters in \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" feel so alive. The film is perfect. It was perfect in 1992 when I was 6 years old, and it's perfect now. (100/5) (Yes, I love the film that much.)  Blu-Ray Review:  Picture Quality: The film is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. To put it simply, the picture quality is flawless. The colors are wondrous, and  the image is razor sharp. This is by far superior to the 2002 Platinum Edition DVD version which looked more pastelish. The darker more bold colors from the original release have been restored, and it's perfection. (5/5)  Sound: The DTS-HDMA 7.1 track is positively thunderous. The music fills the soundstage wonderfully. Also, when the Beast roars, it is LOUD. The 2002 DVD Dolby Digital 5.1 mix was pretty lifeless, but the Blu-Ray track has so much life to it. Perfection. (5/5)  Extras: There are tons of extras here. First, there are three different versions  of the film. There's the original theatrical version (which I prefer, since it's the verison I fell in love with 18 years ago), the 2002 Special Edition which integrated the song \\"Human Again\\" into the movie, and a PIP version of the Work In Progress Version which was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1991. There are deleted scenes, art galleries, original trailers and TV spots, and kid games which I have no interest in. Then comes the amazing \\"Beyond Beauty\\" documentary. This is an interactive documentary which allows you to branch off to different subjects of interest throughout. In all, the documentary runs about 2 and a half hours. This is one of the best and most interesting  documentaries on filmmaking I have ever seen. It's informative, but also highly entertaining. (5/5)  Overall: (5/5) The movie and Blu-Ray are both perfection. Buy it!
B00005JKCH|1.0|Like the comic book it's based on, Spider-Man lacks real substance.   The actors sleepwalk through the highly predictable scripe and Sam Raimi delivers direction that is chaotic and jerky.  The entire film is little more than a showcase for CGI effects that have become so commonplace in films today that they look about as convincing as a pen and ink sketch.
0380789019|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read.  Richard Mayhew is a dull sort of fellow who lets his fiance dicate everything.  But one night, on the way to a restaurant with her, they stumble upon a young lady bleeding on the sidewalk.  Richard's fiance says it is none of their concern and tells him to just keep walking.  For once, though, Richard stands up for himself and decides to help the young girl.  He takes her to his apartment and tends to her, as his fiance stalks off.<br />In the morning, his new friend leaves... and everything changes for Richard.  People start ignoring him, and gradually he realizes he has become invisible to the world of London Above.  That's when he enters London Below, and meets all kinds of interesting characters in his quest to get his life back.<br />I especially loved the ending of this book.  If you haven not read it, I won't give it away.  The last page left me with sense of utter longing and nostalgia.  Do yourself a favor, buy this book.  You'll read it over and over.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is a great album.  This album has a great collection of familiar Nirvana songs.  From the opening track \\"You Know You're Right\\" to the end track \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\", this album rocks.  In addition to the previously unreleased track \\"You Know You're Right\\", there is 1 other previously unreleased track on this album.  It is another version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\", which originally appeared on the \\"In Utero\\" album.  This album is a great one to add to any music lover's collection.  This album captures the spirit that Nirvana was (and still is).  When I played this cd, it reminded me of all that once was great in music.  It took me back to that time in history when rock music was on trying times.  It took me back to year that Seattle broke and \\"grunge\\" was a household term.  All in all, this is a great album, worth anyone's time to listen to, start to finish.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This CD is acutally pretty good! Even though some people see Christina as just a sleep around kind of girl, she really CAN sing. I have to give her credit because she actually wrote most of the songs on the CD. To me that meant that she is starting to take her career a little more seriously. But, as we know to much from Christina, there is a picture of her nude in this CD. And there is another picture of her wearing extremely Short shorts and her back is toward the camera, so you see about 2 and a half inches of her ass. But, the music on this CD is good. She has a nice rock voice...I recommend it!
0345404475|4.0|Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" is set in the year 2021 following a global war that wiped out almost all life on Earth. In particular, many animals were lost. Society in large part has emigrated to Mars, though several survivors cling to Mother Earth despite the dust and fallout. Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter, is one of them. Instead of humans, Deckard hunts androids that have gone AWOL. The androids are incredibly lifelike, so much so that they are almost impossible to distinguish from humans. Only their lack of empathy gives them away.<br />Animals are the world's most precious commodities in this post-apocalyptic society. Because they are so scarce, they are very expensive. However not owning an animal is akin to say walking around naked. It's just not done. People that can't afford them, including Deckard, own electric animals because they are less expensive. Ashamed of his electric sheep, Deckard pines for a real animal; it's what motivates him to collect the bounty on the rogue androids.<br />In \\"Do Androids...\\" Dick is interested in what distinguishes reality from artificiality, the truth from falsity, genuine life from simulated life. Deckard struggles with this idea. In one instance he feels empathy for an admitted android while feeling none for his human counterpart. Isn't that backwards, he wonders? How can one develop feelings for a machine? It is at this point that Deckard begins to seriously question his job.<br />I truly believe this is a great work of fiction, not so much for Dick's style and diction but because of his imagination and attention to detail. In fact, I could go on for pages and pages about Sidney's Animal & Fowl Catalogue, Buster Friendly and His Friendly Friends, the Penfield mood organ (dial 888, \\"the desire to watch TV, no matter what's on it\\"), the Voigt-Kampff test, Nexus-6 androids, Mercerism, etc. The world is populated with such intricacies that as a whole it seems real. One can see it in their mind and imagine living in it.<br />I could read this novel again and enjoy it just as much. And I'm sure I'd get even more out of it the second time. A very quick and easy read, I'd recommend this book to any sci-fi fan, or even general readers such as myself. For fans of the cult sci-fi flick \\"Blade Runner\\", which was based on this novel, \\"Do Androids...\\" is an absolute must.
B00006F2TV|4.0|Transitions from comic books or cartoons to live action feature films don't always turn out for the better. A film based on a superhero is hard as well. It worked for \\"Superman\\" and for \\"Batman\\", and now, it has worked for Spider-Man. To be perfectly honest with you, I was never a Spider-Man fan. I really didn't know anything about the character or the history or any other characters. It certainly was nice going into this movie to realize that you don't need to know anything to get into it. It's all pretty much laid out for you and you don't need to be a rabid fan or Spider-Man junkie to figure anything out. Tobey Maguire plays dorky Peter Parker. A nerd who's just kind of there. During a class field trip, Peter is bitten by a mysterious new species of spider. By the next morning, Peter has gone through some kind of metamorphosis. He doesn't need his glasses and his body has gotten more muscular. The spider bite has given him spider like abilities and super strength. Things go badly when there is a family accident, and Peter then knows right then and there that he has to use his new abilities and help people. Enter rich businessman Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe),who is the father of Peter's best friend. Osborn has gone through a change himself. He masquerades as The Green Goblin, and soon becomes Spider-Man's arch nemesis. Through all of this chaos, one thing stays constant - Peter's love for the beautiful Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst). Director Sam Raimi is known for smaller films like the \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy, as well as \\"The Gift\\", \\"A Simple Plan\\", and others. Some wondered if he had the stuff to handle such a big, epic film. Oh yes, he does. He does the job perfectly. It also doesn't hurt when you got a great cast doing good work. Maguire passes for Spider-Man, but he's far more interesting and intriguing as Peter Parker. Peter has real character. Something to play with. As Spider-Man, Maguire gets to do fancy stuff and wear a cool costume, but all of the character and charm that Maguire gives us as Peter, quickly goes away once he puts the costume on. Willem Dafoe is a great actor. I think everyone knows that. He really makes Norman Osborn a creepy fellow, even before he turns bad. Like Spider-Man, he loses character when he's The Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst is well cast as Mary Jane. She has the sweet, pretty girl next door thing down that would make anyone wish she had lived next door to them when they were young. I don't think she has ever looked as beautiful and radiant as she does here. The rest of the cast includes film veteran Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and a small cameo by the great Bruce Campbell. The movie goes by at a pretty nice pace. It's never boring or slow. It keeps going and it's a fun ride. Pure popcorn entertainment. The only problem I had with the movie were the special effects. Yes, they were fun and really took you for a ride, but I couldn't get over the fact of how faked it looked. That's really disappointing. With a movie like this and with the way effects and everything are nowadays, fake looking special effects are the last thing you would think a movie would have. Especially a movie like this. It makes one scratch their head. The movie would of been so much better if the effects were more realistic. It's been done hundreds of times. I've seen it. What's the deal Sam Raimi?. All in all, this is a colorful and fun ride for everyone to enjoy. It joins the rank as good superhero films. It's not in the 'great' catgory like \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\", but it did what it was supposed to do and it was a lot of fun. Check this film out. Go Spidey Go!!.
B00006CXXU|5.0|When I initially bought this cd, I never expected what I heard. I felt like I took the journey with Christina through all of her pain and love. It was the most phenominal experience that I've ever had. I've read many reviews of Stripped and I'm not so sure which Cd the bad reviewers heard. It doesn't fit into any one genre. Stripped is like a mix-tape, but a good one. It has r&b, pop, hip-hop, jazz, and rock. It is one of the best that I own and i highly suggest it to everyone.
B000002O8D|3.0|as [inexpensive] as it's been sold here on amazon, this live album from '87 rocks and is a worthy and inexpensive addition to any collection...rock on...get a load of Van Zandt's father or grandfather announcing the band on stage at the beginning...sounds like the prospector from 'toy story' Stinky Pete~lol
B00006CXXU|5.0|THIS CD IS AMAZING. I'm listening to it right now actually. \\"I'm Ok\\", a song that she wrote about her abusive father is the most emoitonal song, and just really puts you down, but then the emotion is so powerful that you are drawn to it. Every song on here is great. \\"Dirrty\\" is a great song, but is nothing like any of the other tracks.  If you like every kind of music (except country) it's on here. Shes got almost everything.
6302759110|4.0|I really do LOVE this movie, but I gave it only 4 stars because some of the gore and sexuality is over the top.  However, I loved it because of the story telling (how Dracula came to be) the sensuality, costumes, setting, lighting, music, and most of all the romance!  As a die hard romantic I found that this movie was honestly one of the most romantic I've ever seen.  Now, I realize many will beg to differ and some feel that Mina and the Count were completely incompatible, however when I watch the scenes of them interacting and observe the passion that Ryder and Oldman bring to the roles it works.  In fact, I think one of the most romantic things I've ever seen whether it be in cinema or real life, is the scene when Dracula turns Mina's tears into diamonds.  I also thought Oldman did a terrific job in bringing vulnerability to the role of the Count who in most versions is seen only as a cold-blooded monster.
B000001FYL|5.0|And that is just 1/10 of the sucess and power of this album.<BR>I LOVE BON JOVI, but I can honestly say that this is very different from the band's style. Tho, I think this album is in the style of \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" (well if you  haven't heard that song, where the hell have u been?!) On this CD, Jon went all out in writing AWESOME lyrics that really touch you or make you wanna sing along. Although it is a sondtrack, this CD stands on its own, providing its own very clever story and message. AND! This album may have the most amazing guitar solos, due to not only Jon's great talent but the lil help from his friends: Jeff Beck, Elton Joh, Kenny Aronoff, Aldo Nova, Danny Kortchmar, Little Richard, Bob Glaub, etc.<BR>All in all this is an amazing album, more than just words and melody, these songs have halped me through a lot, just as they won over millions of other fans. Just give it a chance, trust - you'll never regret it!
0385335482|4.0|while reading this book i saw myself in becky's character.i can pretty much relate to her indiscrimate spending habits and her excuses to buy useless things. i just wish the author could have focused some more to becky &amp; suze friendship.<BR>this book has such universal appeal that most women from any part of the world and across all age groups can relate to. it tackled a very common yet serious problem,i.e. poor handling of finances, in a very light and humorous way. it is so engrossing that i cannot put the book down. i cant wait to read the sequel!
B00004ZD69|5.0|who thinks in terms &quot;i like yet not for everyone this one&quot;?  does it matter?  This album is, has, was changing life, my own.  that's the only thing that matters.  for if a cell is only one of trillians of essential building blocks to create man, then what would man be without those cells?  yes we are important enough, words made up of pure musical expression such as these express it sufficiently for one to understand that the only shine that really bursts through our lives are the moments when we realize that a beauty too brave to objectively behold can carry us further than the strongest declaration of independence could possible imagine in an instant.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I've been a Leonard Cohen fan since seeing &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; 30 years ago. The songs he is writing and singing<BR>at nearly 70 year of age are every bit as appealing to me<BR>as his earlier work.
B0000041Q3|5.0|Turandot is my favorite opera.  Pavarotti is one of my favorite tenor singers.  So it stands to reason that these two would marry quite nicely,and in fact this CD set does not disappoint. I'm not a fanatic, just one who enjoys opera, and I think this set captures the dramatic, full quality of Puccini's piece.  Sutherland and Pavarotti and wonderful as one would expect and Mehta conducts with the right feel for pace and acoustics.  Recommended.
B00006CXXU|5.0|\\"Stripped\\" is Christina Aguilera's true sophomore album. No more bubble gum pop. No more comparisons to Britney. A whole new Christina has emerged. A more mature, more provocative, more in- your-face, more honest Christina. The intro. states Christina's objective clearly-- \\"meet the real me.\\" Track one: \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" (with Lil' Kim) will for sure make radio play. It's a song stating if guys can do it, then so should girls-- don't judge girls any differently. Track Six: \\"Infatuation\\" has a Latin feel to it and premiered at the Winter Olympics. The lyrics may be connected to her break-up with her \\"Latin lover\\" and dancer Jorge. Listen for it on radio. Track 11: \\"Beautiful\\" was beautifully sung on \\"The Late Show with David Letterman\\" prior to her release of \\"Stripped.\\" This ballad will be a hit on radio too because the lyrics are not only directed toward Christina, but all people. Track 16: \\"Dirrty\\" (with Redman) is already making waves on Music Televison and radio. This edgy, raw dance/rap song was the official first release. The rest of the album is quite different from this song. Track 9: \\"Impossible\\" (with Alicia Keys) is the most disappointing song because it sounds like Aretha Franklin on Sesame Street. It's okay though. Track 12: \\"Make Over\\" sounds like it belongs on a Sheryl Crow album-- very grudgy with a screaming Christina. My favorite songs on the album are track 14: \\"Soar\\" and track 20: \\"Keep On Singin' My Song.\\" These songs showcase Christina's great voice and great lyrics with almost a gospel feel to them. Christina also has personal songs such as track 18: \\"The Voice Within\\" and track 19: \\"I'm Okay.\\" They are deep, enlightening, and truthful. The album has a great variety of styles and sounds. Old fans will appreciate Christina's metamorphosis into maturity while new listeners will be drawn into her unique sound and talent. If it's pop you're looking for, this isn't the album for you. Christina did a great job showcasing her talents and her ability to be a true artist. \\"Stripped\\" is Christina with \\"no hype, no glass, no pretense. Just me.\\" The wait is over~ Welcome back, Christina Aguilera. Her \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" Days are over!
0465068359|5.0|The atrocities that Japs commited in Asian and especially in China are beyond comprehension. They were the worst of all living creatures. The fact that the only a small fraction of Japanese today acknolwledge these atocities is shocking. history might as repeat itself given similar conditions.<BR>The bombing of Japan by the US during WWII is totally justified. I had only wished that more of the Japs were killed.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is a great single disc collection spanning the career of Stevie Wonder.  That being said, how does Motown define &quot;definitive&quot;?  In regards to performers I think of definitive as substantial, significant, and representative of the performer's best work.  I mention this in regards to two songs on this collection.  First--&quot;Hey Love&quot;--a definitive Stevie wonder song? It is a good song and I like it, but it is certainly not definitive. My choice in place of &quot;Hey Love&quot; would be &quot;If you really love me&quot;.  Second--while I realize it is unavoidable that it was included on this CD since it was one of Stevie's biggest hits--the song &quot;I Just Called to say I Love You&quot; is one of the worst songs ever recorded--by anyone.  That it was given life by Stevie is painful. Oh well, I can program my CD player to skip track 19 and no harm done.  I am thankful that &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; is not included! My choice in place of &quot;I Just called to say I Love You&quot; would be the excellent &quot;Ribbon in the Sky&quot;--definately a definitive Stevie Wonder song!  Except for these two minor points, I feel the compilers of this set have done an excellent job with the nearly impossible task of summarizing Stevie's career in a single disc.  At over 79 minutes, all disc space is utilized.  If you are a serious Stevie Wonder fan you most likely already own most of his CD's or the box set &quot;At the close of a century&quot; (to which I give my highest recommendation!) and may see no point in this single disc. I thought of this but ended up buying it to have in the car--great driving music!  For the casual fan, this CD is of great quality and value and highly recommended!
B00006G8LB|1.0|One of the most irreverent films. The characters in this film are 2-dimensional. The storyline is not that strong. The storytelling is choppy and disjointed. Some of the effects don't look too impressive because you can see that it's been computer generated.<br />Kids will enjoy it for its sophomoric action. Not a film that will enrich the mind.
0316666343|5.0|An amazing book, not a thriller but a contemplation in spirituality and healing - or at least acceptance - following uncontrollable events. It is not a book to read quickly, but one to be digested. The characters span a family and a community, and the writing does justice to several ages and both sexes. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough.
B000056NX5|1.0|... I had great hopes for this production. I saw it on Broadway, and was disappointed in the loss of Gospel of Judas... Hoping the DVD would be more noteworthy, I purchased for my collection - it retained the dullness that was not part of the, in my opinion, original intent of Lloyd/Rice. rather than completing Judas' story (his self-murder) the story ends simply with the crucifixion. A shame and travesty. Hey, Sir Andrew: Why the re-write?
B00005RFAI|4.0|It is amazing how versatile Pink actually is.  She stepped on to the scene as an Pop/R&amp;B act, and now she has taken a whole new approach and gained a whole new audience.  She should not be compared to Alanis Morrisette (another artist that I have a great respect for) for the simple reason that she is still using hip-hop and rock/pop (Pop is something Alanis wants to keep far away from) beats in most of the tracks. Overall, Pink has exhibited great talent yet again.
6303022901|5.0|This is one of the greatest films to examine mother-daughter relationships.  It is also a great film that examines how a women are treated in different cultures.  It is a very full film.  It covers all the bases.<br />The flashbacks are very smooth and everything interlocks with all the storylines.  The acting is superb.  It is very genuine.<br />This is a must-see for every person that appreciates good films.
B00005N83O|3.0|but if you're looking for anything beyond that then skip this CD. She has absolutely no singing talent, and it's lyrically horrible.  They've done a great job selling her, just look at her album sales, but she'll never be taken seriously as a female songstress. <br />I'm hoping for a more mature album next time, both lyrically and vocally, although I'm not holding my breath.
B00006F7S4|4.0|After five plays to my fairly indifferent ear &quot;Sea Change&quot; began to work its' spell. Maybe it was because I was driving home on a dark, rainy night that its' gentle rythm just caught the swish of the wipers and caught me up with it. OK so the beat seldom varies but nor do the pictures in a kaliedoscope though each has its own particular charm. This is an engaging collection of songs that wears its' late '60s / early '70s heart unashamedly on its' sleeve. Wait until dark, get in the car and drive with Beck through his own personal timewarp.
0393307050|3.0|I had heard a lot of good thing about O'Brian and his series of naval adventures, so on a whim, I decided to check him out, and appropriately, to start at book one.  What I found was a book that has a lot to recommend it, but not one that appeals to my particular tastes.<br />Master and Commander is an episodic tale that introduces Captain Jack Aubrey and the various people in his life.  Aubrey, the main character, is not an easy person to like: he is a borderline mercenary and pirate, more ambitious than patriotic and not overly bright outside of naval matters.  I suppose he matures as the series goes on, but I don't know if I'll stick around to find out.<br />The essential flaw in the book is its reliance on naval terminology.  While this adds an important level of verisimilitude, it also makes the story more inaccessible to those unfamiliar with these concepts.  There is some explaining, but a lot is left for the reader to figure out.<br />On the plus side, O'Brian does tell a good overall story, both simultaneously old-fashioned in style and modern in the things he depicts.  Nonetheless, I cannot give this work more than three stars, as his weaknesses offset his strengths.  For fans of naval adventure, I am sure that this story would rate higher, but for others, this book is likely to try your patience.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Excellent album, if only because Beck is paying tribute to one of our alltime best: Gordon Lightfoot!!
B0000584TI|5.0|Octopus is one of my favorite progressive rock recordings from the seventies. Knots, Rackentour Trubedour (sp?) and Boys In The Band were so far out of reach for American radio. Its a shame really, as only the most risky FM station would play this band at all (In Detroit, thank God for Judy Adams and WDET!)! Gentle Giant is tight and innovated in ways I heard described as genius. The word genius best discribes this band and this recording. There are really five outstanding GG albums. This ranks at the top!
B000000OSG|4.0|What can I say?  I said it all in the first review.  They could do a really good reissue of this as a double album.
B00006CXXU|5.0|After hearing the debut single, Dirrty, I had thought this album would be just as horrible as it was.  I was completely shocked to hear that it was nothing like it.  Stripped is everything I had always known this tiny little girl with a huge voice was possible of.  Gone is the teen pop of Britney and the Christina album of before.  With the exception of Dirrty, which I absolutely despise, this album is gorgeous.  She is truly talented and while she still needs to fire her stylist and stop caking on the make-up, at least she has released an album that will show the world where the real talent lies.  Britney Spears is certainly not the Queen anymore.
0790736039|5.0|I can remember watching this as a child and it scared me half to death! Especially the first part which on its own i would give 10/10 When as kids they face the Evil Clown/Demon/Monster<BR>'Pennywise' played to near perfection by Tim Curry aswell as the group having to deal with Racists and Bullies.The Second part is not quite as good and a bit of a let down and on its own i would give 8/10.When the group, now adults return home and have to fight Pennywise once again.But i cannot overstate how let down i was by the ending.All through both parts i was glued to screen but as soon as i saw Pennywise in his real form i just cannot tell you how much of a let down it was, i nearly laughed at the screen.I have never read the book but im sure it is better than the film adaptation But overall this film has:<br />Suspense,Horror and THE most terrifying Clown that youll ever see.<br />9/10
B000053GTK|5.0|My understanding of the history of this recording is that the band wrote it are finished recording it within a two week time frame, shortly after they had completed Octopus. This is just a fantastic Progressive Rock record at anytime during any year! I just love this band!!! If your just getting into Gentle Giant, this might even be a better place to start than Octopus. Experience & In A Glass House should rate as two of the best hard, progressive rock songs of all time!
B000000OSE|4.0|Yeah, waaaay guilty...<br />As for the album itself, it's a big blend of material.  I personally hate hair metal, but these guys manage to give it a good name.  (Motley Crue still sucks.)  They outdo every other heavy metal band of the era by presenting diverse instrumentation (piano, keyboard, strings, horns, etc.) on one hand, and by showing the ugly side of life without flinching, on the other.<br />While the songs are long, as they are on Use Your Illusion 2, I still wonder why this was never released as one album.  ...<br />On the downside, it's hard not to notice commercial motives in the songwriting.  Axl can keep his mouth G-rated for the ballads, but then goes over the top with the [language] this and the [language] that on the harder songs, as if he was out to prove something.  I could care less that he swears, there just comes a point when it comes across unnatural.<br />As for the best things on this album (and Illusion 2, as they're more or less 1 and the same), there's lots of introspection on songs like \\"November Rain\\", \\"Estranged\\", \\"Civil War\\", \\"Dust N Bones\\", \\"The Garden\\", \\"So Fine\\", and \\"Back off Bitch\\".  (Ok, I was kidding about that last one.)  There's also a strong taste of the real world on \\"Coma\\", \\"Pretty Tied Up\\", \\"Perfect Crime\\" and \\"Double-Talkin Jive\\".  It should be warned that, although this one has \\"Don't Cry\\" and \\"November Rain\\", it's the harder of the two discs.  Illusion 2's ballads aren't as famous but there's more of them.<br />It's definately not for everyone.  But it sure beats \\"Appetite for Destruction\\".
B00003CXTG|4.0|With all the negative things said about this film, I want to defend it a little.<br />It does have a long love story introduction, but war destroyed lives and we appreciate more the sacrifice of those lost when we appreciate more what they gave up.<br />I was really worried when I learned before watching the movie that it was a love triangle (2 boys after the same girl) but I'm glad that in a sense it was a moral conflict since boy #2 thought boy #1 was dead, so when he hooked up with the girl he wasn't maliciously stabbing him in the back.<br />Not a bad movie.
B000066NW0|5.0|This was a really great cd. It had three of my favorite songs on it. Avril Lavigine is a really talented singer. If you like great cds with a little bit of everything on it you will really love this cd! I abmit that I did not buy this cd off of Amazon.com, but the second I brought it and I came home I put it in the cd player right away. I had been waiting to buy this cd forever! Every time I was in the car and a song of Arvil Lavigne's came on I would quickly turn it up! This is my favrite cd and she is my favorite singer. I hope you found my review helpful!
B000006YYM|5.0|Gentle Giant hit their musical peak about the time they put this record out. Kerry Minnear is just an astounding keyboard artist. I wish there was more to hear from this time period of this band. The entire band just come together on this record in ways no one could have predicted. This record has some of the band's hardest edged stuff GG has done as well as some of the most melodic tunes they ever wrote. Cogs in Cogs, Aspirations, Proclimation, etc.    there is a box set called, Under Construction. It has a couple of Minear improvs from 1974. The Power and tThe Glory is a melding of talent, compositional chops musically package in a way that is complicated, interesting and at times beautiful. Next to In A Glass House this is my personal favorite. Awesome spin!
B00003CXE7|1.0|I watched Gladiator on TV last night - what a piece of ... Oscars all around for this garbage? [I] always knew the Oscars were BS, but now I really know it for sure! Was Ridley Scott sleepwalking when he did this? I know he's inconsistent (see Bladerunner for one of his great films) but this verges on Paul McCartneyesque erosion of talent. This is from the same year \\"Traffic\\" was released - not a perfect film but surely more Oscar-worthy than this waste of celluloid (and waste of my time). I will grant that this type of \\"epic drama\\" is best suited for the big screen, not chopped up for television, but ... is ... whether it's 20 feet tall or the size of my TV.   This movie is glaringly dumbed down - it relentlessly plays to the lowest common denominator, whether in its annoying and intrusive musical score (the placement and use of the music more than the music itself) or it's laughable \\"faux Shakespearean\\" dialogue ... what, the Romans spoke fake Elizabethan English? Bad fake Elizabethan English? I realize there's precedent for this type of speech in historical dramas, but it frequently doesn't work and it's certainly misplaced here. The special effects, scenery, etc. look good but, as with the recent Star Wars movies, the window dressing doesn't really matter...Forget Gladiator.      Edit: I was looking through my profile today, and skimmed through some of my past reviews.  It needs to be said that this one was fairly heavily censored, making it appear to have been far more obscenity laced than it really was in its original version (for example a word meaning \\"excrement\\" beginning with C and ending with P was removed, among others of similar nature).    More importantly, a lot of the content was removed, and several phrases substituted for my actual words.  For instance, I never wrote \\"Forget Gladiator\\" (Nor \\"F.. Gladiator in any form). The review was more coherent and read a LOT better before it was bowdlerized.  Having said that, I'll still stand by the bit of itwhich did make it through.  The bad fake old English accents were particularly jarring in the film, in addition to the stilted performances.  I like action and period films if they're well done.  This one wasn't.
0553212478|5.0|Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of the original Gothic horror classics, along with Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula.\\"<br />If you only know \\"Frankenstein\\" from the movie versions, this book will come as a surprise.  There is less detail on the creation, no criminal brain vs. normal brain, no Igor, no fabulous lightning storm, no bolts in the neck and no slow-moving gait.<br />In fact, Shelley's narrative begins with letters from an Arctic explorer, R. Walton, written to his sister.  Walton's passion for exploration is explained and his quest for companionship detailed.  Then, while his ship is trapped in the northern ice, he spots a creature crossing the ice.  Following the creature is a weakened man in a broken sledge.  Upon rescuing the man, Walton meets Victor Frankenstein, and so begins his tale.<br />We learn of Frankenstein's family background, upbringing in Geneva, early education and fascination with the nature of the world.  Upon entering university, he expands his knowledge of physical science and chemistry.  It is there that he begins construction of a being that he plans to bring to life.  Through Frankenstein's narrative, we begin to see his descent into an obsessive madness, more manic than maniacal, a bi-polar disorder of the nth degree.<br />The assembly and bringing to life are kept vague, probably because Shelley herself lacked the scientific knowledge, but cleverly veiled by Frankenstein's own admission, lest another try to duplicate his work.<br />Dr. Frankenstein succeeds, and when the creature awakens, Frankenstein is so repulsed that he abandons the creature and flees his laboratory.  He has a breakdown, and only the arrival of his best friend, Henry Clerval, brings him back to health.<br />What follows is Victor Frankenstein's demise through the machinations of the being he created.<br />I love Mary Shelley's language, so evocative of the time, full of color, passion and darkness.  The voices are very distinct, and we get to hear the creature's story of what happened when he was thrust into the world, cast away by the hand that created him.  The creature is far from the dull movie versions, in fact he is quite intelligent, mastering language by observing a family as he hides in a hovel next to their home, discovering the joys of music, and reading the work of John Milton.<br />But, he is alone and an outcast, and implores Dr. F to create a mate for him.  The Dr. denies him this request, taking a moral high road lest he should unleash a family of demons upon the world.<br />There is so much to enjoy here, from the lush detail of the travels of both the Dr. and the creature.  The range of emotions displayed by both make each sympathetic and pathetic at various stages.  There is also the strong message about violating the natural order and trying to play God.  One must be ready to face the consequences.  This is a powerful story.of what happened when he was thrust into the world, cast away by the hand that created him.

B00006CXXU|5.0|While the general public was shocked, appaled and rendered speechless towards Christina Aguilera's new image and new single, the musically lite portion of society (that is to say, the not-so-general-public)saw through Christina's changed, matured appearance and did what true music lovers do best: close their eyes and sing along at the top of their lungs.  \\"Stripped\\" offers mature musical growth; inspirational, true life lyrics; and a new, edgier, soulful style  la Alicia Keys and Pink.  To top it all off, \\"Stripped\\" is an evolution of Christina's God-given talent.  While others may refer the album's title to Christina's fashion sense, I believe it symbolizes Christina stripping away her pop-fueled past, the image society demanded of her and stripping down to the core essense of music: lyrics that ring true and a heavenly voice sans synthesizer.
B000063S6Z|3.0|I believe I wrote a review for this already, but I want people to know what they're getting themselves into.  I don't own any other Moby albums besides \\"Play\\" (which to me was genius).  I really liked \\"Porcelain\\", \\"Rushing\\", and \\"Inside\\".  With 18, Moby tried to pull a hat trick by repeating the same formula.  Those string arrangements... ahhhh!  Why?  And the repeated sample thing was a good motif for \\"Play\\", but I was hoping that would be a thing of the past and he would toss things up with \\"18\\".  I was wrong.  The majority of the \\"Play\\"-esque songs not only sound like \\"Play\\" rejects, but they sound similar to the ones that did make the cut.  One of the songs (and I believe it's \\"In This World\\") reminds me of \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\" so much that it isn't even funny.  But, he does redeem himself with \\"We Are All Stars\\", \\"Extreme Ways\\", \\"Signs Of Love\\", and \\"Another Woman\\" (the best song on the album because it's a 70s-esque song).  Besides those, there's really nothing to talk about.  Just download the songs I mentioned from the internet.
0140177396|4.0|This book is about two men Lennie and George, who have many hopes and dreams. They lead lives walking around from one place to the next with no family and no one but eachother. Steinbeck poingts out the themes in indirect ways and once you rad it you will lay their thinking about it for an hour. I did not label it 5 stars because I only do that if it is like the best bok in the world. You may label this 5 stars I reccommend this to anyone who loves Steinbecks books.
B0000025T6|5.0|Nebraska is a crazy album.  One of sprinsgteens's best and it only has one actual rock song(atlantic City).  I gave it 5 stars because not only lyricaly is it a masterpiece but musically it is simply magnificent.the onyl song that bothers me is &quot;state trooper&quot; annoying to listen to but lyrically haunting.  Which is almost captured in the guitar for the song but it really just didnt get me.  All the other songs are simply about life.  So i ask you what can be more magnificent then that?
B00006F2TV|5.0|If you have seen the movie, you will definitely want to add it to your DVD collection!!
0060005424|5.0|Lirael is a great book! Don't be afraid of how long it is (ok, I was, but then I actually read it and it was worth it!). This book is exciting and suspensful and the characters rock. In this story, you get to meet Lirael, a Clayr who does not have the Sight (something that allows the Clayr to see the future-and something all Clayr have). You also meet Prince Sameth and Princess Ellimere. Sameth ROCKS! Anyway...this book is very suspensful and right when it's really exciting and deep in the story, it ends. And the sequel's not coming out until February! Well, this book is awesome. I highly reccomend this book, but I think you'd get much more from it if you read Sabriel first. There's a lot of magic/fantasy stuff in this book I didn't understand in Sabriel but understood in Lirael. Also, many Sabriel characters are in this book. Anyway, read this book and you'll know what I'm talking about!
B00006LLNU|4.0|It's reasonable to assume, and helpful to understand, that Sigur Ros isn't for everyone. Most people need the comfort of a &quot;normal&quot; format to the music they listen to. Many people can't listen to eight minute songs that dwell on a particular thought, even if that thought is elaborately expressed for said amount of time. Many people don't like a man's vocals to sound like a woman's.<br />That being said, I really love this album. One of the best things about ( ) is that it sounds little like Sigur Ros's last album, Agaetis Byrjun. Granted, you still hear plenty of that bowed guitar that this band is so well known for, but you hear it in far subtler ways. Guitarist Jonsi something-or-another does far more traditional guitar work (minus actual chords, most of the time) that creates the structure of the songs, unlike the mass waves of bowed guitar present in the last outing.<br />As I said, this album is nothing like the last. For crying out loud, there are no song titles, or for that matter, any writing of any kind in the album booklet or cd casing. But, I'm ok with that. To me, the fact that I can't understand a word of these lyrics actually lends itself to non-titled songs.<br />What makes ( ) stand on its own is the fact that these men are talented musicians, and the soundscapes that they create will touch you, as long as you're willing to listen. As I said before, not everyone can listen to 8 minute+ songs. But if you truly let yourself go, you're going to see the beauty in these songs. If you let it, you're going to feel something from these songs. I don't know how one couldn't, because they are just that good.<br />Think outside the box, step outside the paradigm that modern music has assigned you. Try this album. Download it if you're too afraid to take a chance (that's how I got to know them better). But, whatever you do, just take a listen. You'll find places in your soul that you never would have expected. Music this surreal can do nothing but.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Even though the cover is a bit shallow, when you listen to the album, you get a much deeper message. If you have heard Christina's song 'Dirrty', you should know that it is the only song on the album like that. The rest of the songs are quite different. Before you pass it up, give the album a chance. You may be surprised.<br /><br />1. Stripped Intro - This is pretty cool, it's got alot of people talking about Christina in the beginning, then Christina starts to sing. She introduces you to the real her, stripped down. 10/10<br /><br />2. Can't Hold Us Down(feat. Lil' Kim) - This is sort of a hip-hop song. Christina is singing about womens rights. \\"This is for my girls around the world, you will come across a man that don't respect your word, thinking women should be seen and not heard, what do we do girls, shout louder!\\" The songs got a good beat, and in the end there is an awesome breakdown. 9/10<br /><br />3. Walk Away - This is one of my favorite songs. It's a soulful ballad, and Christina sounds amazing. This is a standout song. 10/10<br /><br />4. Fighter - This is one of my favorites too. The music sounds very live, almost like a garage band. The song is about someone who backstabbed Christina, and the person made her a fighter. The vocals are great, Christina growls and sounds very angry. 10/10<br /><br />5. Primer Amor Interlude - Christina speaks in spanish. Translated, it tells of her first love with dancer Jorge. 9/10<br /><br />6. Infatuation - This has got some great music to it. Christina sounds good on this track. It's a creative mix of mostly english and some spanish words here and there. 9/10<br /><br />7. Loves Embrace Interlude - In the background you can hear birds chirping and a woodwind instrument, the whole thing is very peaceful. In the end Christina begins to sing softly. 9/10<br /><br />8. Loving Me For Me - A soft ballad abouta guy loving her for her. The vocals are very light and easy on the ears. 9/10<br /><br />9. Impossible - This one was written and produced by Alicia Keys, so it sounds like something she would sing. Christina sounds soulful and even like Alicia in some parts. 8/10<br /><br />10. Underappreciated - This is about feeling underppreciated in a relationship. \\"What happened to those days when you used to be compassionate, caring what I thought and said, so attentive, a gentleman, now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set\\"<br />Kind of bluesy song. 9/10<br /><br />11. Beautiful - This is definitely a confidence building song. In the first verse, Christina sings \\"I am beautiful no matter what they say, words can't bring me down, I am beautiful in every single way, yes words can't bring me down, so don't you bring me down today\\" In the second verse she replaces 'I' with 'you', and in the third verse, 'you' with 'we'. 9/10<br /><br />12. Makeover - This song has drawn comparisons to the Sugababes. It's a different sound then most other songs on the album. Christina sings that she doesn't need anyone to make her over, just let her be. 9/10<br /><br />13. Cruz - At first it sounds country, then it turns into a ballad. Great song. I like how she uses her voice in some places. 9/10<br /><br />14. Soar - Gospel influenced with a positive message, \\"Don't be scared to fly alone, find a path that is your own, love will open every door it's in your hands, the world is yours, don't hold back and always know, all the answers will unfold, what are you waiting for, spread your wings and soar\\". 10/10<br /><br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours - I don't really care for this song. She is basically singing about casual sex. But the beat and the way she sings is nice, I just hardly listen to it. 3/10<br /><br />16. Dirrty(feat. Redman) - This was her first single, you have probably heard it on the radio. People think this is what the album sounds like, but this is the only song like this. Very hip-hop sounding, great party song! I really like the beat. 8/10<br /><br />17. Stripped Part 2 - Basically acontinuation of Stripped intro. 9/10<br /><br />18. The Voice Within - This is one of my favorite songs, probably the best ballad on here. Very inspirational and good to listen to when you are feeling down. In my opinion, it's the perfect ballad. Standout track. I love it! 10/10<br /><br />19. I'm Okay - This is the song about Christina's father abusing her family. It has very creepy music, it sounds like something you would hear in a horror movie. Christina is very emotional on this track. Towards the end of the first chorus it sounds like she is trying to keep from crying. And the first time she says \\"I'm okay\\" her voice breaks, it is so sad. In the beginning of the song you can hear a child sniffling/crying. The lyrics are very moving. This is a haunting song. One of my favorites. 10/10<br /><br />20. Keep On Singing My Song - Gospel influenced. Christina sings about not letting what people say get her down, she will just keep on singing her song. She holds out a 12 second note towards the end. The song is a little long, but it's a great song. 10/10<br /><br />I would definitely recommend you buy the album because it does have some deep messages. There are a lot of great tracks and inspirational songs.continuation of Stripped intro. 9/10<br /><br />18. The Voice Within - This is one of my favorite songs, probably the best ballad on here.

B00006V9A0|5.0|Well, Well, Well,         What's it been... 8 years? Wow, the whole world must have lived in a cave. Finally!!! I have been a fan of Nirvana since 91. They are the second coming of the Beatles. No matter what they put out as a Nirvana compelation, it will be good. In fact, this band didn't live on a \\"particular single\\". If you ask any fan, they will simply tell you that it's not one particular song, but the whole song book. Whether it was Love buzz, About a girl, teen spirit, radio unit friendly shifter, or very ape, its all good. The only thing that think could have done better was to put out something new. the only true gem on this is \\"You Know You're Right\\". Why? because you can get everything else on all of their cds, plus all of the other great gems. Personally, I am waiting for the box set. What we really need is a live video concert that has never been seen, or something that has never been released before. All in all, this cd is a breath of fresh air, and get the new fans a taste of what their body of work is like.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This CD is absolutely wonderful. Its beauty is so magnificent I cannot put it into words. If youre one of those people who only buy cds once in a while because theyre expensive, this is the one you should be buying. Everyone likes is, kids, teenagers, grandmas and even motorcycle guys. I reccomend this album for everyone.
B00005ASIL|5.0|I have just about everything Jethro Tull has ever done and I got this album, well ... just because. But I really like the way it plays, especially the shortened versions of \\"Too Old To Rock'n'Roll..\\" and \\"Heavy Horses.\\" In the liner notes, Ian Anderson says something to the effect that on some songs in the past he got a bit carried away, thus the lengthy versions of the above mentioned songs were produced. I much prefer these shortened versions. <BR> If you enjoy Jethro Tull then buy this album. You will enjoy it! I certainly have.<BR>P.S. To Zanegang who asked if this CD has the extended version of \\"Bouree?\\"  No!  You're thinking of the version that's on \\"A Little Light Music\\" by Tull released in 1992, where David Pegg plays bass and then Ian performs a fast and furious flute solo.
B00005UEAR|5.0|dream theater, this guys have proved to be one of the best<BR>progressive music bands on the world. with 7 studio cds and 3 live albums, god theses guys are rocking! <BR>i've followed them since 1999 before the release of their 6th album, and i've been amazed. dream theate has sure becomed one of my favorite bands through the years and hopefully they'll keep going better.<br />buy this album!
B00006LLNU|5.0|Amazingly beautifully sobering, upliftingly sinking, thank you Sigur Ros for the rollercoater.  I cried several times throughout the first listen
B00006V9A0|5.0|At Last, it's been 6 years since 1996 release of \\"Muddy Banks\\", we got an enormously shocking album. This album can be mentioned as \\"Best Picked song\\" since Most of the song is massively Hits from the 90's, probably some of the song for new fans is unfamiliar like \\" been a son \\". <BR>I have most of Their releases, and i can say that there's somethin missing from this album like \\"Dive\\", it should be 2 CD's not only one.. because , anything comes out from Kurt's mind is a brilliant idea, except his decision to end his life
B000062Y98|4.0|Blind Guardian is one of the most talented bands I've ever heard. Their metal expertise in the field of power metal is unrivalled. The German group's latest CD is not their best, but it certainly is one of the best CDs ever nonetheless. Blind Guardian's new CD has many great songs, but my favorites have to be 'Battlefield', 'Under the Ice' and 'And Then There was Silence'.'And Then There was Silence' is a spectacular 14 minute song that never repeats itself and leaves you breathless at the end. This CD is an absolute must if you like Power Metal, or any type of metal for that matter.
B00000K3CK|5.0|I read recently that this film was released in June of 1947. Let any Christmas film be released in June and see how well it would last ( you have to have substance to do this...lol).<br />I guess the reason I , and all the other reviewers, think this film is so great is that it brings back the time when we could &quot;believe in Santa Claus&quot;.<br />It also features unforgettable performances...among them a younger William Frawley ( who would go on to co-star in I Love Lucy) as well as Natalie Wood, who made the star of the remake look sickly in comparison.<br />This movie is worth watching if only for the scene where the attorney for Kris Kringle asks the district attorney's son who told him there was a Santa Claus.<br />Buy this film and relive the wonder of Christmas.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil is one of those rare bands that is extremely heavy, yet even your parents can enjoy listening to it. It is quite possibly the best gothic metal band ever, surpassing the likes of Paradise Lost, Theater of Tragedy and the Gathering. This CD will also appeal to anyone who likes metal, even those who like death metal, thrash and more progessive metal. It will really be a hit among those who enjoy metal bands like Nightwish and Tristania and among die-hard gothic rock fans. Lacuna Coil is from Italy, and has one of the best female vocalists (and hottest), of any band. I hope they are around for a long time. I love every song on this album. Buy it now! You will enjoy listening to it.
6300216403|5.0|Comming on the heals of his brillant Last Picture Show, director Peter Bogdanovich again demonstrates why he ranks within the top echolon of post-war Hollywood directors. His uncanny ability to recreate a depression era small mid-western town feel, right up to the radio broadcasts the serve as a backdrop of the day is as stunning here as it was in Last Picture Show. I won't get into the plot as other reviewers have covered that ground exhustively. Surffice to say Paper Moon is one of the most engaging comedies ever. With great ensamble performaces by Madaline Kahn, John Hillerman and P. J. Johnson and the truely inspired casting of Ryan O'Neil and daughter Tatum, Paper Moon will delight endlessly. Absoluely Must-See entertainment!
0609610570|3.0|I though the book was a good quick read.  As you will see in other reviews, the book tended towards generalities.  It's key ideas are excellent, but not new.  The linkage bewteen vision, strategy, and operational plans is well done.  There are a lot of annecdotes, and some numbers and examples.  The book tends to stay in the rarified air of CEO strategy.  The book draws heavily from the GE experience and on information in Welch's books.<br />I also saw strong parallels to the topics discussed in the Malcolm Baldrige criteria (linkage, strategy, plans, resources) and systems thinking (Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline).<br />I think this is good as an introductory book and in providing context, then move on to other books for the meat of the subject.
B00006LLNU|5.0|...it is much better. While the sophomore &quot;breakthrough&quot; album was a majestic slice of heaven, this follow-up is a more textured, sometimes darker and more sinister album. And ultimately more rewarding. True that the first half (the &quot;happier&quot; half) sounds like a continuation of AB (which is by no means a bad thing, the third song is lovely), but the darker half blows it all away. The tension in these songs build nice and slowly to soul-crushing climaxes. The above review is true, they sound like nobody else on the planet. Icelanders do it better.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This album is mostly an album to introduce someone just getting into the band's incredible music and legacy. Us Hardcore fans will DEFINITELY be disappointed. \\"You Know You're Right\\" is the only reason why a hardcore fan might want to buy this. Those corporate fat cats at the record label are just looking to make some money. For those of us familiar with all this just download the new song from the internet. Kurt would've wanted it that way. I'll wait for the Boxset.
0375414053|1.0|Sorry I spent good money on this book.  From the reviews I thought it would be a funny take on  typical working Mom..  I think the author more interested in showing her grasp of the English language  .....  I planned to read it and buy some for gifts. Glad I reviewed it first.
0618135871|5.0|I don't explain plots.  Read any other review, you'll get a good idea what the book is about.  I'll comment on Philip Roth's writing which is lean and mean.  The way he has created David Kepesh reminds me of reading someone's private diary.  While reading The Dying Animal I continually thought how simple and pleasurable and complicated life could be.<br />I enjoyed The Dying Animal very much.  Philip Roth does not disappoint.  He could write about anything and make it good reading.
0451196716|5.0|Reading that sticks to your ribs (so-to-speak). This story will stay with you for years.  I read 'The Long Walk' as one of the original short stories of the Bachman Books about 10 years ago.  I still remember the details to this one story to this day.  I have always considered this to be the best of the best of Steven's works.  After reading 'On Writing', Mr. King agrees.<br />I lent my original copy to a nephew who never returned it.  It took me 5 years to find the same [original] print.<BR>I've since lent this book to two people whom I felt needed to read the story for different reasons:<BR>* the first being one of those 'I can do anything' types.  Loves a physical challenge, even at his age [45].  He needed a little reality check, and agrees he'll never forget this story and the emotions he felt while reading it.<BR>* the second I accompanied on \\"A Walk to Remember\\", a 444 mile trek to NYC.  Each day he walked 35 to 40 miles; each day he rested and slept.  A grueling walk for him, blisters, shin splints, the threat of stress fractures, but never the possibility of not finishing the walk for reasons described in this story.  Every day I reminded him that I had a book for him to read - 'The Long Walk'.  After reading this book, he agrees this is not one he could have read during his rest periods of the trek.<br />I'm not one to recommend books or stories, but this is a reader's MUST.  Just keep telling yourself -It's only a story. -It's only a story.
B00006CXXU|5.0|In a matter of years, we have seen Christina transform.  From genie in a bottle to dirrty diva, the many sides of Ms. Aguilera have stunned and even frightened us all...(who could forget the medusa dreads she wore for a bit?) But beneath the over-produced tracks and 'individual' flavors, her voice has reigned.  Enter: Stripped.<br />We all expected Christina to fade away, but, goodness, were we wrong!  Metamorphisis has occured, yet this time...she has changed in a different sense.  She has finally showed us the real artist underneath it all.  As she promises on the intro: [N]o hype, no smoke, no gloss.  Just Christina...and the art we call her music.<br />She transcends over all styles of music and flavors...from the heavy rock of FIGHTER to the fiesta that is the Spanish-tinged INFATUATION...from Jill Scoot-inspired LOVING ME 4 ME to another Alicia Keys masterpiece IMPOSSIBLE.  She giggles with WOMAN power, blasting all of those who suffocated her on CAN'T HOLD US DOWN (with Lil' Kim's failed attempt at singing).  She reveals her insecurities in BEAUTIFUL and dazzles with the jazz-blues roots of WALK AWAY where we imagine her in a bar enchanting the midnight customers with her voice.<br />There is MAKE OVER, the hippie song that sounds like its on acid....and UNDERAPPRECIATED sounding like an old-school groove.  Whether she tastes gospel, reinvents blues, reawakens popular music, dips in R&B, we see her growth slathered all over the album.  Not only in music sounds, but in content.  Listen to the lyrics of the songs and watch how much the woman has grown.  I must mention I'M OK, a haunting song about abuse with the emotions overcoming her majestic voice and sending shivers down the spine.<br />Honestly, this is the music dreams are made of.  In her chance to regain the spotlight, she has stripped back the layers and invited the listener into a wonderland: her mind.  We see the masks peel back, the truths drip, and magic dazzle every corner.  She is no child anymore.  No, she is not a girl.  And no, she is not afraid of declaring her womanhood, her humanity, and her enchanting talent.<br />We know that she has star material and this icon has just begun to fly.  Her star shall last and we will look back on this moment when a new star was created.  Go on, girl.
B00006F7S4|5.0|What a fantastic album.  Goosebump inducing.  Tears welling up in eyes.  Driving down the road as the sun sets.  An instant memory.  This recording is an excellent companion and if you have a chance, catch Beck with the Flaming Lips.
B000068GA4|4.0|Glenn Danzig is in top form as a singer and songwriting on this, his peak as a solo artist (or frontman of a band named after him, depending on how you look at it). Produced by Rick Rubin and featuring the classic backing band lineup of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and drummer Chuck Biscuits, Danzig II continues in the hard rocking blues-metal vein of the singer's debut album. Like many other Rubin productions (such as Danzig's debut and the Cult's seminal \\"Electric\\" album), Danzig II features a dry, stripped-down production reminiscent of AC/DC (Rubin's favorite band and the model he used for how he wanted his acts to sound). But thanks to Danzig's strong, instantly-identifiable songwriting, the album never sounds derivative.<br />After this album, Danzig would begin co-producing albums with Rubin, but they only made 1 together before Danzig stopped using him entirely. His backing band also fell apart after his third album, and Danzig began adopting a more Goth-oriented industrial rock sound, to the detriment of his music. But Danzig II stands as a brilliant piece of both heavy metal and of classic bluesy hard rock.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Well, actually, he's better than Superman. I should say the movie is. Superman was probably the best comic book adaption (although with some minor flaws) until X Men and Spiderman came along (I have to also give credit to Batman Returns and Blade--both were very good adaptions). Spiderman manages to recapture all the wonder I remember reading the comic when I was a kid. Screenwriter David Koepp (who worked on Jurassic Park among many another films) does a marvelous job of fleshing out Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's characters. What is most impressive is how the mythology is incorporated into an action story. Most film directors would have spend half the time dealing with Peter Parker's transformation or origin. Instead, we get it all reduced to the first 20 minutes and Spidey actually gets introduced within the first hour. We also see many of Spidey's exploits through a montage.<br />The direction by comic devotee Sam Raimi fits in perfectly with the character and story--which is no surprise given Raimi's comic book visual style (see Darkman, Army of Darkness or any of the other Evil Dead movies for a demonstration of his \\"panel\\" visual style). The direction is also informed with a love of comics which radiates throughout the picture creating much of the power of the film. Credit also goes to Raimi for not trying to \\"mainstream\\" Spidey and make him respectable. He doesn't pander to highbrow critics by making this into something more than a spectacular adventure film. Although it lacks the impressive backstory of X-Men (the motivation for Magneto is established very clearly in the film version and it has resonance beyond comics), Raimi more than makes up for it with a stunning series of visual set pieces.<br />The visual effects with the CGI Spidey are pretty impressive. Their not 100% convincing as of yet but are pretty darn close. You do believe (for the most part) that a man can climb a wall. John Dykstra's (Star Wars, Star Trek: TMP) visuals are fluid and well integrated into the action. There are some sequences where it's difficult to distinguish CGI from the real actors. An example is the scene where Parker tracks down Uncle Ben's killer in as the \\"Human Spider\\". Most of the sequence is CGI with Tobey Maguire's eyes the only real thing in the shot.<br />Willem Dafoe crackles and cackles as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. I was afraid that he might overpower Maguire (a la Jack Nickolson's Joker from Batman). He doesn't. He plays the dual role with enough conviction and with a touch of madness where we can almost feel sympathetic for Osborn. The rest of the cast including Kristin Dunst as MJ are credible and seamlessly weave themselves into the fabric of the story.<br />I actually would give Spiderman 4 1/2 stars as there were some areas of improvement in the visuals (the CGI Spidey). I also felt that the characters were well developed (J. K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jamieson is a hoot--exactly as I would have imagined him). I felt that killing Gobie was premature (although it does set up Harry Osborn's hate of Spidey and the potential for him to don his father's outfit in a sequel)but the sequence works.<br />The extras are just icing on the cake. The screentests for Maguire (a great action sequence similar to the one where MJ is attacked by goons in the film)and Simmons reading Jameison's lines)are great. The gag reel/outtakes are a chuckle (particularly Willem Dafoe's scenes where he proves how over the top he could have been as Gobie). I would have loved to see more of the CGI screen tests (including earlier tests) but the single example included here is impressive. It's easy to see why the film got the greenlight given all of this.<br />I don't think James Cameron (who had wanted to direct Spidey) could have done this film any better. In fact, I personally feel based on Darkman that Raimi was the only director really up to the task of directing Spiderman. Hopefully he can keep the quality high for the second film (Parker was fired by Dr. Morgan who later turns into a villan in Spiderman so that could be the set up for # 2). I have the feeling that Columbia/Tristar will be releasing a Ultimate Spiderman boxed set with more material later down the line but, unless you're a completist, this all the Spidey that you'll need. Definitely one of the top 10 films of the year.fired by Dr. Morgan who later turns into a villan in Spiderman so that could be the set up for # 2).

B00006NSZ5|4.0|I have to admit I was much more excited for the 8 Mile movie to come out rather than the soundtrack, but after hearing Lose Yourself I decided to pick it up anyway.<br />Let's get the bad out of the way first, since it's completely ironic.  If anyone would have told me that the worst two songs on one album would come from Nas and Rakim, I would have laughed in their face.  Surprisingly, the unthinkable has happened.  Nas's \\"You Wanna Be Me\\" is another song addressing the beef between himself and (insert Jay-Z, Cormega, or Nature here).  Nas, you've already beaten Jay, and Cormega and Nature will never be as popular or talented as you.  Please give it a rest now.  R.A.K.I.M. is the only other bad track on the album.  Unfortunately, it's to no fault of Rakim.  The beat is absolutely attrocious and the hook is even worse.  The God of hip hop comes off nice as always if you can stand to sit through the song.<br />The star of this is album is obviously Eminem. But what makes this CD so good is the depth that his label, Shady Records, shows.  I loved Obie Trice on Drips from The Eminem Show, and he doesn't fail to disappoint on his appearances.  50 Cent finally jumps off the mix tape scene to contribute to the soundtrack.  Listen to Love Me, where Em, Obie, and 50 rip a dark beat with a beautiful voice sample on the hook.  Jay-Z and Freeway appear on 8 Miles and Running, which features a verse that will have people fiending for The Blueprint 2. Freeway's verse is average at best and his voice is, as usual, the most annoying in hip hop.<BR>  Finally, Gangstarr's \\"Battle\\" is arguably the best song on the album as Guru rips an excellent DJ Premier beat.<BR>All in all this is a very nice surprise.  Even the baffling placement of Macy Gray seems to somehow fit on this album.  Very highly recommended.
0553381709|5.0|The superlatives used by the majority of reviewers almost can't describe the overwhelming excellence of George R.R. Martin's groundbreaking fantasy epic, which reaches yet another level of greatness with this third book of a fantasy series, which will be the ultimate measure for the next decade of novels of this genre.<br />After taking us into a world of intricate political machinations, breathtaking heroics, fatal betrayals, foredoomed affairs of the heart and blood, and an awakening magic about to return to a world at the eve of eternal chaos with the first two books of the 'Song of Ice and Fire' series, Martin manages to capture the readers attention once again. Additionally he succeeds in raising the suspense and the fascination for the stunned reader to yet another new level. The moment you start reading 'Storm of Swords' you won't be able take a break from reading this astonishing masterpiece of contemporary fantasy literature.<br />So, what's it about?<br />After the Lannisters have fend off the assault on King's Landing by Stannis Baratheon, their ascent to undisputed dominance over Westeros appears to be only threatened by young Robb Stark, King of the North. The Baratheon line has been decimated to the last stronghold of Lord Stannis, the Starks are under pressure from an unexpected foe threatening their heart lands, and the remaining political and military powers seem to flock together under the banners of juvenile, but cruel and ungoverned King Joffrey Lannister. But the Lannister's reign is shadowed by the unpredictable fate of the brothers Jaime - still under captivity by Catelyn Stark, and Tyrion - severly wounded since the fight at King's Landing. While Tywin Lannister tries to secure his grandson's hold to the Iron Throne, mysterious powers beyond the frontiers of Westeros are steadily growing, threatening the balance of life itself on the lands devastated by war, famine and anarchy. In the far north, Jon Snow struggles to uncover the secrets of the wildling hordes while attempting to preserve his very integrity as a Black Brother. And on the other side of the world, Princess Danaerys has yet to master challenges of warfare and treachery to lay the final claim to her rightful seat on the Iron Throne.<br />What makes this book so extraordinary is far more than just a complicated and thrilling pattern of medieval strife and heroic exploits. Martin uses down to the bone honesty to describe human ambitions and passions. He reminds us that the line between benefactors and criminals is never pin sharp. And success and failure stand only as separated from each other as chance and circumstance permit. His plot is witty and never predictable, the dialogues used are charming, sharp and spirited, and rarely I have seen such a huge cast of carefully outlined characters. It's been a long time (in fact since Donaldson's Gap series) since I have experienced so many different feelings for the main protagonists, ranging from cheers to hatred and from sorrow to utmost astonishment and joy - and more than once I had to discover, that my personal feelings concerning a specific character had undergone a 180-degree turn from rooting to booing (or vice versa).<br />Admittedly Martin is no easy-going read. His style of narration and writing competes with the likes of Iain Banks and Umberto Eco, his tales are full of symbolism and hidden meanings and the plot is so thick and rich of surprises and backyard information, it can be really tough to keep all details in mind. But whatever it takes to follow Martin's ambitious writing: It's worth every piece of paper and minute spent reading. Cuz the way Martin gets the reader involved in his story is simply outstanding and when you finally reach the final pages of 'Storm of Swords', there are only 2 things left to say: First 'Wow!' and second 'When will Book 4, 'A Feast for Crows' finally be available...'
B000002OOY|5.0|John Williams has done it again, by composing one of the hottest scores to be found in his collection. It is a ride that will keep any music lover asking for more. It creates a wonderful feel of solitude and fear as it paces through with beauty and grace. <BR>  Critics said that the movies score was too bombastic, but i disagree. The fast paced tracks keep your heart pumping, and recomend this score to anyone.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist is my favorite movie movie of all time. I've seen it probably one hundred times, and when &quot;The Version You've Never Seen&quot; was released theatrically, I went four times, to get the big-screen experience. (I was a baby when the movie was originally released.)<br />  The movie itself is amazing, and the picture and sound on the DVD are perfect. The commentary by Director William Freidkin is as boring as could be, with nothing worth hearing. The other extras are TV, Radio, and Theatrical spots, and a few text features. Why they couldn't use some of the extras that were on previous DVD versions of the film is beyond me. The excellent documentary &quot;The Fear of God&quot;, featured on the 25th anniversary DVD would have been a welcome addition to the disc. As another reviewer stated, get this version if you're looking for a great film. If you're looking for extras, get the 25th anniversary DVD.
B00006RINF|5.0|I became a Lacuna Coil fan about four years ago, and this band just keeps putting out albums that are better than the last.  This CD is extremely well-produced and the songs are as interesting as ever.  Vocally, this is the best Lacuna Coil album ever.  They have moved away from the growly screaming (for the most part) and use more melodic singing in its place.  I would like to see this album get some American radio play.  If any of their albums could bring Lacuna Coil into the mainstream, this is the one.  Fans will of course be as impressed as ever.  <BR>The Enhanced CD features are not incredibly exciting, but worth taking a look at.  The video gives you a chance to see some behind the scenes stuff, and the photos add a human element to the band members.<BR>The bottom line is that this is a spectacular band that has put out another great collection of songs.  Buy it.
B00000DCHD|4.0|For Billy Joel, the 1970's proved to be a very difficult climb, but a rewarding end to a difficult era in his music career. At that time, he had a troubled marriage with his first wife, Elizabeth, and ended a partnership with his very first manager. Nevertheless, his music never seemed to step out of place. In fact, it just started to get a little better.<br />Billy's last album of the 1970's, 52nd Street, proved to be a healing and yet valuable album to Billy Joel's career. The album marked several hits in Billy's New York style mind, including Honesty, Big Shot, and the always amazing, My Life. Each song reflected all the lessons learned that Billy Joel would take on for years to come.<br />Although 52nd Street won the Grammy for Album Of The Year in 1979, the music would showcase Billy Joel's lessons again in the 1990's, with his second manager, Frank Webber, and his second ex-wife, Christie Brinkley. Surprisingly, 52nd Street is always the exact same road that Billy Joel has made, for comfort from that dark road. I truly recommend this record.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Every single song on Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" is amazing. Although she released \\"Dirrty\\" which I feel doesn't represent the album AT ALL, it is still a good song. The songs \\"Impossible\\" \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"I'm Okay\\" really show off her amazing vocals and \\"Make Over\\" is a funky sound, quite unique but never the less wonderful. Aguilera not only shows off her vocals, but also her writing skills as well. Overall, \\"Stripped\\" is a wonderful cd, and please don't be discouraged by her image or first single-the album is gold. Pick up a copy, you WON'T be dissapointed.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Finally an album with all of Nirvana's best songs! Any Nirvana fan will love this album. Not only does it include such classic tracks as Teen Spirit but it also as one previously unreleased single....what more could you want??
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina, since her debut album, was never happy with the songs she was allowed to sing, the clothes she had to wear, and the personality that she had to show.  Finally, we get to see the real Christina; the good, ugly, and downright scary.  I was a fan of hers since she released her debut, but I'm more than able to accept her new style, sound, and persona.  Christina's genre-hopping sophomore album is definitely worthy of Grammy awards.<br />1. STRIPPED: An effective, revealing intro ... it tells us that underneath it all, Christina considers herself somewhat of a misfit.<br />2. CAN'T HOLD US DOWN: Interseting, down-played female anthem, but Li'l Kim's rap makes the flavor of this song sour<br />3. WALK AWAY: Definitely one of the standout songs; a classic blues performance with haunting emotion<br />4. Fighter: An awesome, hard-hitting arena rock song about her manipulative former manager<br />5. Primer Amor (Interlude): Starts off a 6-track story about Christina's relationship with her dancer-boyfriend Jorge<br />6. Infatuation: Really the only song with Latin flare, very sellable<br />7. Love's Embrace: An extremely corny and pointless interlude<br />8. Loving Me 4 Me: Personally, my least favorite song off the album, but it's a fan favorite<br />9. Impossible: Amazing vocal performance, so much emotion<br />10. Underappreciated: I love this song!  Very funky, very Jill Scott; this song ends the story about Christina and Jorge's romance<br />11. Beautiful: A wonderful song that many people need to hear, very much an anthem<br />12. Make Over: VERY DIFFERENT!  A brave move on Chrstina's part to try something WAY out there ... a standout track in my opinion<br />13. Soar: Very soul, not my favorite<br />14. Cruz: Pretty uplifting<br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours: The best song on the album, hands down ... so funky, smooth, PERFECT<br />16. Dirrty: The only song of its kind on the album; only this song, Can't Hold Us Down, and Get Mine Get Yours have any blatant sexual connotations; don't judge the whole album on this song<br />17. Stripped Part II: Christina admits she isn't a virgin here.  Britney, when will you?<br />18. The Voice Within: Inspiring, kind of Disneyish<br />19. I'm OK: WOW!  Brave move!  It's haunting, emotional, and raw ... it was a one-take recording, and you hear her almost cry - very personal<br />20. Keep on Singing My Song: Forgettable<br />You need this album!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Who wrote the phrase &quot;No man is an island&quot;... Will's answer...&quot;Jon bon Jovi, to easy...&quot;<BR>The opening credits to a fantastic movie.<BR>This movie labled in our local cinema is put in the genre of Romantic Comedy...But it's much more than that. It is a coming of age movie, for both a boy and a man. Will is a 38 year old male equivelant of a spinster who has never had a job in his life and lives off of the royalties of his fathers only song. When he meets 12 year old Marcus, he descovers more about deep and meaningfull relationships, and living life to the full. Marcus learns about men and what to be when he grows up and tries to understand Wills view of life. With a briliant soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy, and a fantastic cast and writers, this movie is well worth the top shelf in your DVD collection.
B000002UKS|5.0|Their debut (largely Dave Grohl's solo album) was no slouch at all, but when they went to make their second album, The Colour and the Shape, they totally went in there, recorded 13 breathtaking songs, and resulted in one of the greatest hard rock albums of the 1990s, and certainly the greates hard rock album of that year. <BR><BR>Dave matures as a songwriter on this album, from ballads like &quot;Doll&quot; &quot;February Stars&quot; and the haunting &quot;Everlong,&quot; to rockers like &quot;My Hero,&quot; &quot;Wind Up&quot; and &quot;Monkey Wrench.&quot; This album solidified Grohl as more than just the former drummer of Nirvana, and he emerged from the huge shadow left behind by his friend and bandmate, Kurt Cobain. The transistion from uber-drummer to excellent guitarist/songwriter may have been awkward at first, but now he's one of the best musicians out there. <BR><BR>Probably their best album (unless ONE BY ONE is better than this one), and chances are, it'll be remembered 20 years from now, and hopefully the Foo Fighters will be a long-enduring act.
1878424319|5.0|What we need is more self help books with a spiritual base to it.  At our essence we are all souls inside our bodies.  Thus, focusing on growth in this area is of absolute importance.  This book helps guide one on this path.  Another Spiritual book I would recommend that is equal in worth to this book is called, &quot;I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You&quot;  It's about a mans struggle with faith after his brother dies of mad cow disease.
B00001NFCY|1.0|After 1997's semi-decent MY OWN PRISON, Creed released HUMAN CLAY, which seems like leftovers from MOP, omitted for obvious reasons. Scott Stapp's &quot;I wanna be Eddie Vedder/Jim Morrison&quot; vocals sound like Michael Bolton on the tracks when he tries to scream, and dradfully annoying on others. Mark Tremonti tries to be Jimmy Page, but his riffs are bland and uninventive. <BR><BR>Yes, 10 million fans can be wrong. Do not be fooled by the mass public who actually bought this album. All this album is good for is pseudo-Christian philosophies, and a bunch of posers trying to come off as a band that will one day be legendary. <BR><BR>I gave this album, and the band a fair chance. I listened to their albums without any influence from the media, but they do not impress me at all. And since then I've realized how cocky and arrogant they are, and for that I dislike them ever worse. If you want an emotional band, listen to Pearl Jam. These guys are just a stale derivative trying to be the real thing, but resulting in some nasty side effects.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What can you say about The Beatles. I am only 16 years old, and I already knew every song on this collection before I bought it. <br />The Beatles had many different sides to their music, and they are all expressed in this remarkable collection. It starts off with their teeny-bopper days: 'Love Me Do', 'Can't Buy Me Love', 'She Loves You' etc. It moves onto their more siner-songwriter folk sense in songs such as: 'We Can Work I Out', 'Eleanor Rigby', 'Paperback Writer'. Then goes the 'Hippie' years with selctions such as: 'All You Need Is Love', 'Penny Lane', and 'Hello Goodbye'. 'Then ot the late 60's era: with cuts such as: 'Hey Jude', Lady Madonna', and 'The Ballad Of John and Yoko'.(Note: I have not told you all of the songs on this collection, pick up this release to get the rest. <br />27 Number One hits over 8 years! This collection is a must have for any 'Real' musci fan, and all the ones who are just posers, should pick it up also. This collection shows you how the Beatles changed the world of pop/rock music and tells new music fans, where their music came from, and what great music is.
B000002G7E|5.0|After the commercial disappointment of their first album, the VU were hurt, but certainly not finished. They went into the studio in mid-1967 to record an album even more abrasive and sonic than their debut. If you thought VU & Nico was uncommercial, just put this on your stereo.<BR>The title track is like a 50's rock and roll song doused with amphetamines and weird feedback. \\"The Gift,\\" a story Lou Reed penned in college, and narrated by John Cale's crisp Welsh accent, is about a romance gone wrong, when Waldo Jeffers puts himself in a box and mails himself to his girlfriend, with a rather disturbing ending. \\"Lady Godiva's Operation,\\" is also sung by Cale with parts by Reed, with a weird adaptation of a folktale, ending in a  blotched sex change operation. The two-minute \\"Here She Comes Now,\\" later covered by Nirvana, is the softest song on the record, and probably the most accessible song on the record, and it is actually very good. Then the sonic explosion of \\"I Heard Her Call My Name,\\" with more feedback and fast drums, goes into the 17 minute anti-psychedelic jam \\"Sister Ray.\\" The song is about a transvestite (Sister Ray, get it?), and probably has the very first reference to oral sex in a rock song and it's actually quite humorous that Lou Reed refers to the man's phallice as he does in the song. I guess other words for it was way too risque. But it doesn't matter. The VU were never about compromising with the mainstream. Some say that it is excellent and others think that it is about 10 minutes too long. But if you have the endurance or if you're in the mood to zone out for 17 minutes, \\"Sister Ray\\" is the song for you. This is my personal favorite VU record because it was so risque and so unheard of to release stuff like this, especially in the age of psychedelia, and this is like the exact opposite of what was in the mainstream at the time. The VU took risks that no one else was willing to take, and they had a lot of guts to release such a throwback to the repetitive \\"flower power\\" sound and way of life. Unsurprisingly, this album also failed commercially, peaking at 199 on the Billboard charts, but it still remains influential, and definitely has gathered a cult of its own. The next album would bring a radical departure, and this was the end of the avant-garde experimentations of the band, since John Cale left in mid-1968.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Or: ways to deal with your legacy and know how to treat your fans right.  Case in point, Pavement's incredible and incredibly affordable Slanted + Enchanted reissue with bonus tracks galore, superb remastering, live goodies, and wonderful packaging.  It sets the standard, plain and simple.  A gift to Pavement fans, done with more than a little bit of love.  (Thank you, Matador.)  And sure, while we're there, Slanted IS a better album to begin with but who - besides possibly a green and soon to be rocked 12-year old - can honestly say this 'Nirvana' is worth the wait?  It's a cheap cash-in and Cobain would have hated it.  1st: you can fit more songs on a CD.  20 songs at least.  Does Geffen (C. Love?) know this?  Does Geffen know that Nirvana had at least 10 more songs worthy of inclusion in a Best Of, songs that would have probably fit?  As well as lots of unreleased stuff?  Where is the heavy stuff?  Where is the light meandering stuff?  Who is this made for?  Not fans.  This is not an over-view.  This is an MTV view.  For fans, a CD single of the great 'You Know You're Right' should be on hand.  Where is it?  Here's hoping Geffen redeems its squandered good will and comes through on the box set...  <br />The one star, then, is not for the music contained.  That gets FIVE.
B000002UJQ|5.0|All of the discussion about understanding lyrics and the requisite multi-listenings and so on and so on are really very good and I agree with them all.  But home come no one mentions the brilliant musicianship in an era where a good studio tech can take a cute little girl with no talent other then her looks and turn it into a multi-platinum seller.  This album outright rocks, and does so in a way most artists ignore these days, complex song structures, lots of guitars, great bass lines, amazing production and true hearfelt emotion.<br />No, your probably not going to get either the lyrics or the music the first time through.  But this is not some avant garde work by an &quot;artiste&quot; solely meant to alienate you.  It simply asks you to realize the alienation that already exists everywhere and to rally against it, and it does it with great music.<br />Maybe its a cliche but is this album the swan song for Rock 'n Roll?
B00006LLNU|5.0|It is difficult to describe Sigur Rs with words. The best description I was able give after Agaetis Byrjun was that they sound like a mixture of Low and Radiohead, except underwater with whales. Agaetis Byrjun does have a distinctly underwater sound, and listening to it was like swimming in the ocean at night. ( ) has a lighter, softer, feel overall, though it does get heavy and intense at parts. It's like walking through an ice cave. ( ) is the perfect album to take a bath with, lay on the floor in the dark with, fly on a plane at night with... you get the idea. It certainly won't wake you up in the morning, but it will fill your head with visions of floating on your back over snow-covered mountains. If you liked Agaetis Byrjun, you'll love this one.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Way over rated.  An interesting introduction quickly disintegrates into a terrible written 2nd half of the film.  Not worth the money.
B00006CXXU|4.0|i hated the song dirrty when it first came out, and i still hate it.  BUT, the rest of the CD is nothing like that song, as far as style goes.  here are my thoughts on this CD:<br />1. Stripped Intro - i hate a lot of intros that artists do, and i usually just skip them.  actually, i hate every one of them, and i wonder why they insist on doing them.  but actually, this one's pretty good, and i wouldn't mind listening to it.  a 5 for a intro is very good, because intros/short songs never get more than a 5 from me. 5/5<br />2. can't hold us down - has a hiphop sound to it.  obviously...since it has lil kim in it.  i don't like hiphop that much, but this could possibly be a single(?)  pretty good.<BR>7.5/10<br />3. walk away - blues put  me to sleep...and this is what this song is.  i guess normal people would like it...but i'm not normal.  i'm usually harsher with my scoring on real songs, compared to intros... 6.5/10<br />4. fighter - my favorite song on the album wish a rock sound it.  if you don't want the album, at least check out this song.  seems to be the favorite of many people. 10/10<br />5. primer amor interlude - just her talking in spanish.  it leads to the next song4/5<br />6. infatuation - it's a song with a spanish flare to it.  she starts off speaking in spanish, then mixes english and spanish in the song.  one of the top songs on the album. 9/10<br />7. loves embrace interlude - just a short song that leads into the next song. 4/5<br />8. loving me 4 me - has a blues and jazz style to me.  reminds me of a certain mariah carey song.  \\"bliss\\" without the high pitch voice.6/10<br />9. impossible - definitely blues.  people playing in the background...again too slow for me.  nice vocals though, and much emotion put into it. 6/10<br />10. underappreciated - not a slow sappy song as the title seems to imply.  could be the next girl power song. 6.5/10<br />11. beautiful - a ballad.  i like ballads...i just hate blues.  has a good message for young girls. 8/10<br />12. make over - the background music kind of sounds mid-eastern.  interesting song.  a song where christina gets everything off her chest.  the anger song. 6.5/10<br />13. cruz - sounds like an old style ballad.  gets too repetitive for my tastes. 6/10<br />14. soar - another ballad.  has a gospel sound to it...with the choir in the background.  decent song. 7/10<br />15. get mine, get yours - reminds me of gangsta lovin...pretty good, though i'm not too happy about the lyrics... 8.5/10<br />16. dirrty - i said i didn't like this song.  6.5/10<br />17. stripped pts 2 - another christina speaks her mind song.  short... 2/5<br />18. the voice within - another ballad.  probably my favorite ballad off this album.  beautiful lyrics. 9/10<br />19. i'm OK - a song about her father.  has a blues sound to it, like P!NK's song. 6.5/10<br />20. keep on singing my song - the last song is always horrid on  most CDs.  and i'm not gonna make an exception on this one.  i hate how CDs make it super slow and boring at the end...and i usually fall asleep.  pretty good, but too many ballads. 6/10<br />Total (not including short songs): 7.2  not bad...=)  overall, i liked the album, so you should check it out.  unless you absolutely hate any kind of ballad.
6305971099|2.0|Basically part 5 is just like the previous halloweens, suspensful at times but ruined by a predictable ending that you know is coming but you just sit there and watch it anyways, maybe people just like to see people get stabbed and killed brutally.  it's a year later from where part 4 left off, the girl is in some mental hospital, meyers kills about eight people and goes after the girl, the girl fends off meyers for awhile until good ol crusty doctor loomis comes in and shoots meyers with some darts.  Meyers is then hauled away to a prison but of course he breaks out at the very end.  okay so that was a spoiler but it was so obvious that you would have to be an idiot not to know what was going to happen.  one burning question still remains, why dont people just gang up on michael and cut him into pieces, burn the pieces, put the ashes in a jar, and throw the jar into the bottem of a lake?
B00004T9UH|5.0|The Marshall Mathers is one of the best CDs I ever heard it cointains a mix of humor and a mix of songs that makes you feel   better when you need it the most.the soundtrack Marshall Mathers is my favorite
B000000OPZ|3.0|Because Whitesnake only broke big in America during their hair metal period, people remember them as a hair band, but that isn't strictly true. In the UK and Europe, Whitesnake had been a highly successful, classy blues/ rock band with a big reputation and a supreme live album (&quot;In the Heart of the City&quot;) to their name. This blues heritage gives their 1987 album a genuine rock &amp; roll authenticity that takes it a cut above many cheesy rock bands. That said, this CD isn't lacking in cheese itself.<BR>Guitarist John Sykes (ex-Thin Lizzy) provides gutsy axe work that puts hair on the chest of Coverdale's bluesy songs and manly vocals. In short, they introduce Def Leppard to Led Zeppelin and with huge hits like &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, everything comes up roses.
0375414053|5.0|I have read so many good books lately, The Lovely Bones, To Kill a Mockingbird, Stupid White Men, and now I Don't Know How She Does It, which is right up there with the rest.  Of course my fellow train-riders think I'm nuts, because I will suddenly laugh out loud, and pull out my Blackberry to send a quote to my husband.  He calls it husband-bashing, but hey, they own everything, so why not?  This book is a joy to read.
B00000I07P|5.0|Bon Jovi were far from the first band to create anthemic pop rock, but with \\"Slippery When Wet\\" they created a masterpiece. Sure, it has famous singles (The first time I heard \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" was virtually a religious experience in the back of a friend's mangled Skoda), but it's the consistency of songwriting that makes it so great. The feelgood, rousing pop rock of the singles is more than matched by the album tracks. \\"I'd Die For You\\" has a keyboard part reminiscent of the band's breakthrough \\"Runaway\\", and with Richie Sambora's mega guitars equalled by mega choruses and mega production from Bruce Fairbairn, you get the feeling that the boys from Jovi deserved every bit of the success they got.
0345413377|5.0|The Amber Spyglass made me burst into tears with its stunning array of love, mystery, and betrayle. People you thought were evil were simply afraid of showing emotions due to being too sensitive...I love this book so much and cannot wait until the Book of Dust to come out. The philosphy about God being an angel still makes me feel weird...
B000001EHS|4.0|Def Leppard have had a great deal of hits, and Vault has all of them. As a result of VH-1 giving heavy airtime to the band, Vault has been selling shedloads recently. It's quite right too; other '80s metal bands might have been cheesy acts cashing in on the trend, but Def Leppard with producer Mutt Lange invented the concept of metal with huge pop hooks, great melody and huge harmonies, and created songs with substance. The classics are all here, and that's the problem. Because Def Leppard's hits are all on Vault, people are ignoring their other classic releases and their new ones. That's a real shame, because there are so many other great Def Leppard songs. For those wanting an overview of the best known stuff, however, Vault has it all.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I would have to say that the Beauty and the Beast DVD is an awesome and \\"well-worth-it\\" buy.  I wasn't really expecting much from this DVD.  I just thought: \\"oh what the heck, I'll buy it even though I already have the VHS version\\".  But boy, was in for a great surprise!!  I loved the original version that came out in 1991, and I still love it today even though I'm a bit older, but this DVD takes the cake!  This DVD is magnificent.  You can really tell that Disney spent a lot of time, effort, and $MONEY$ into making this DVD.  Don't let the fact that it's a \\"cartoon\\" fool you.  THis DVD comes jam packed with behind the scene footage, directors comments, games, music videos, etc.  I'm telling you, there is SOO much on this DVD!!  I'm still discovering new things on it!  Some of the great features on this DVD is the afore-mentioned directors comments in the background that you can switch over to, if you want.  Also, this DVD movie can be viewed in it's entirety in French! Since I'm trying to work on my french, I found this feature especially wonderful.<br />I don't want to give away any more surprises, but TRUST me, this DVD makes a GREAT gift for the young and the old!  I would DEFINITELY buy it or order it if you haven't already.
B00000I07Q|4.0|The biggest-selling album of 1987, a record breaking tour... what did Bon Jovi do next? Put out another record of course! The hard working quintet put out New Jersey before the world had quite recovered from the power of Slippery When Wet but New Jersey manages triumphantly to escape the shadow of its predecessor. Things are a bit more serious, and musical development into Springsteen territory ensures that it's no mere Slippery replica. Bon Jovi are about massive anthems, though, and the first three tracks off New Jersey will leave your speakers smouldering from the stadium-sized power. <BR>The production is as awesome as you'd hope for, and with 5 US top 10 hits and plenty of other potential single material here (&quot;Wild is the Wind&quot;), any fan of Slippery When Wet should pick up New Jersey without delay.
B00000DFSK|4.0|...it's still missing some songs, some tracks are single edits, and the tracks are in a non-chronological sequence. Here's what should have been:<br />1. I Will Follow<BR>2.

B00005JLF5|5.0|FORGET VOYAGER, DEEP SPACE NINE FOR DVD FORMAT NOW!! <br />What can I say, Deep Space Nine is one of the best television programs of all time. All I ever read is bad things about DS9, it irritates me and if it irritates me think what it must do for the superb writers, actors and directors of the series. <br />Even people who dislike Star Trek will enjoy this series because it is different and everything is not all smiles and isn't the future great. It is also more charactor based as oppose to focusing on Sci Fi. Avery Brooks is fantastic as Captain Benjamin Sisco, Armin Shimerman(Quark), Colm Meany(Miles O'Brian) and Rene Auberjonois(Odo) are also exelent.<br />Don't take my word for it, watch the next episode airing in your area or buy a VHS. I recommend all the 2 part episodes, obviously the pilot if you have never seen the series. There nearly all good, you won't be dissapointed.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Tobey Maguire swings into new heights of excitement in the crowd-pleasing blockbuster \\"Spider-Man\\". After being bitten by a genetically enhanced \\"super-spider\\", the life of social outcast Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets an unsuspected turn as the wall-crawling, web-slinging hero Spider-Man. Now, New York's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man will face the wrath of the maniacal Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and win the admiration of sweetheart Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). \\"Spider-Man\\" is a sensational box-office spectacle that combines rousing comic-book adventure and strong human drama. Director Sam Raimi has captured the spirit and heart of the comic that surely satisfy audiences and fans of the genre. The action scenes are straight out of the comic-book and the special effects are good but not quite \\"amazing\\". Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast for the role of Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe delivers a devilish performance as the Green Goblin. Fans of Sam Raimi's work will notice Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi in small roles and expect a small cameo by Lucy Lawless (Xena).<br /><br />Columbia definitely scores high marks for their latest DVD release. The crowd-pleasing comic book blockbuster hit is presented in a 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a bright video transfer with rich detailed colors. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is clear and very enjoyable. \\"Spider-Man\\" Special Edition comes fully loaded with two audio commentaries with director Sam Raimi, cast member Kirsten Dunst and visual effects crew, three informative behind-the-scenes documentaries, theatrical trailers, TV spots, screen tests, two music videos, a short gag reel, comic book archives and the 25-minute \\"Spider-Man: The Mythology\\" featurette. The DVD menus are colorful but not always easy to navigate. Overall, \\"Spider-Man\\" scores an \\"A-\\".

B000002G7E|5.0|just give it a listen! if you like blues, punk, industrial or noise, you'll find all you want on this record. at first i thought it was just 60's avant garde art rock, but it's not as pompous as that. critics may puff it up as an elitist collector's dream, but it's a great little record on it's own. groovy, finger-snappable; it's got great personality. another treat is the fact that you are getting Lou's wit with Cale's aural madness plus Sterlings grooves and Moe's tribal trash can lid percussion: this is pure VU, sans Andy n Nico(if ya want a real slice of Nico pick up the Marble Index.) nothing in the 60's sounded like this. it's not mind-expanding, socially conscious, peace rock: it's self-absorbed, self-indulgent, debauched sonic sleaze with a rusty razor at your neck. one of the most interesting tracks on this album is \\"The Gift\\": a quirky gothic story(in the vein of E.A.Poe) about two seperated lovers who's relationsip comes to an end in a tragic and humorous twist.
0380820846|3.0|Not her best work, some parts were kinda ho~hum, but like I said still a pretty good read and a must have for any Bridgerton family fans!
B00005JL2O|2.0|Most people in this world are busy, so I will not wase your time.  Let me start off by saying that this movie is very poor.  Sure the begining is pretty good, but then it justs gets weaker and weaker.  The ending is just plain BAD.  There is no other word for it.  Dr. Evil turns out to be Austin's brother?!  What's up with that?  If you really want to, rent it.  I would never wase my money on...like this.
6305842442|5.0|Sci-Fi, drama, love, action and film noir.  This film does it all!  Scenery, acting, script, lighting, costumes, editing and directing.  This film has the best of it all.  Phillip K. Dick, Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford. All their talents are here.  And lets not forget the ORIGINAL score by Vangelis.  The best of it all comes together to set the mood to take you to another place and time.  I can't wait until 2019 here in Los Angeles for BLADE RUNNER to be a reality.  This is why its my #1 movie.
6305949980|5.0|This is a great movie with incredible stop motion animation. The story is fantastic, my kids love it, they watch it all the time
1572522232|3.0|This movie is good but somewhat outdated. The murders are gripping but the added colored lighting throughout the movie gives it a cheesy look. Overall: GOOD.
078322799X|1.0|I was really disapointed by this movie made by my favorite director Peter Jackson. I was wondering how anyone could possible like this movie it is dumd and ridiculeos, there is no way Peter Jackson made this.
B00003CXI0|3.0|This movie start fairly good, but once they get to the castle it stalls out. Nothing big really happen, only isolated events. The game part of the movie just doesn't do it for me. Overall: Fair.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This movie set the modern standard for all sci-fi films to come. Even in a period with no computer assistance, the special effects are usually very convincing and generally excellent (with help from Walt Disney's studio for the &quot;Id&quot; monster &lt;ahem&gt;). <br />The film is a classic and a must to own. My copy offers both letterbox and standard viewing options. I personally rate this #1 on my science fiction list. (Now, if they'd only come out on DVD with &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;, my next favorite sci-fi classic..).
B00006G8G4|5.0|This has to be one of the best super hero movies ever made, the dazzling special effects will blow you away. Thanks Raimi
6304711905|3.0|But that's about it. The Dvd portion of it didn't have behind the scenes or commentary. I felt it could have been so much more. Especially since the movie was so rich in history
B00006V9A0|1.0|First off I was upset that the set list was not posted so here it is: <BR>You Know You're Right(The only new,\\"authorized\\" material present)<BR>About A Girl<BR>Been A Son<BR>Sliver<BR>Smells Like Teen Spirit<BR>Come As You Are<BR>Lithium<BR>In Bloom<BR>Heart Shaped Box<BR>Pennyroyal Tea<BR>Rape Me<BR>Dumb<BR>All Apologies <BR>The Man Who Sold The World <BR>This was released by either the milk maid or Courtney Love. Your choise. Nirvana doesn't merit a greatest hits album. All of their greatest hits are on their regular albums. Buy those by all means. I can't comment negativley on any songs as I like them all. <BR>If they wanted to score a hit album with this, they should have released stuff that you can download, but is bootlegged like Chorus Verse Chorus, or Suicide Samurai. There are so many rare gems out there and I thought I was going to get on here. Nope. While I expected an Anthology type album here I cannot knock the content. However I do knock the intent. Poor marketing all around. Didn't these record company executives go to college? <BR>The buying public isn't stupid. Kurt would be embarrased by this attempt. <BR>This too shall flop.
B00006CXXU|3.0|Is it possible for Miss Aguilera to cramp all the diva-ness in the world into a 78 minute record? Yes, she says. Good girl turned stripper X-tina seems to takes tips from Whitney, Mariah, Janet, Destiny's Child, Madonna, Alicia Keys, Gwen Stefani and Avril Lavigne when she made Stripped. She just about touch base with every single one of their formulas and tried to turn them into her own. At times, it's convincing and other times, it's just pretentious and over the top. 'Can't Hold Us Down' sounds like a bitter version of DC's 'Independent woman', only not as fun. 'Impossible' not only is written with the help of Alicia Keys, but actually sounds like a track from Key's CD. 'Beautiful' is the shining track here with raw and pure vocal, but it is not very convincing when the same CD contains 'Dirrty'. 'Infatuation' is catchy latin-pop, but quite forgettable compare to Madonna's 'La Isla Bonita'. 'Walk Away' is decent but overlong and the interludes and intros seems taken out of Janet's book, but not as sincere. There are some nice tracks here though. 'I'm ok' is touching and haunting and reminisent of Madonna's 'Oh Father'. Loving Me 4 Me is an effective sensuous track with vocal performance that sounds  a bit like a cross of Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. 'Cruz' is uplifting and 'Get Mine, Get Yours''s R&B is closest to Aguilera's former self and undeniably catchy.<br />Overall, the album is overlong and is trying to take on too much, but I can't deny that X-tina has a great voice. And she sang the hell out of herself on Stripped. That's all that matters for a diva afterall.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an exquisite album. I simply could not put it away. Norah inherited the melancholy and sensitivity of Billie Holiday yet manages to escape Billie's pessimism - the songs on this album are an ode to sensuousness and delightfulness of life;  she echoes the sweetness and strength of Nina Simone at her best....  and then there is Come Away With Me, one of the best songs I have ever heard.  I have friends who have been listening to this song alone for days on end.<br />You can't miss with this CD.
B00006G8G4|2.0|I love the movie!  It is literally a comic book page that has come to life.  But the Collector's edition is a farce.  For the so called \\"collectible\\"  items you receive it is way over priced.  First you receive a cheesy reprint of the first Spiderman story.  Big deal!  You can get that at almost any comic shop.  Second, a John Romita and Romita Jr. print.  It's really cool!  It's the first Spiderman cover redrawn by these two legends.  The problem......it's not even autographed individually.  John Romita Jr's. autograph is printed on it.  Come on guys.... you could have the thing signed.  Third, you receive a 35mm cell.  Fine.  It's not numbered.  Gee.....how collectible.  Fourth, It has an additional DVD with Stan Lee and Kevin Smith.  Ok...fine.  Bottom line is....I have a cool movie and a nice box to keep some comic books in.
B00005U122|5.0|I bought this DVD because I had a hankering to hear some of my favorite Pink Floyd songs, and I was unable to find a Pink Floyd DVD at the time, so I settled for this. And this has turned out to be the best music DVD I have in my collection. All the Floyd songs are faithfully played by this excellent line-up. It is a huge yet understated production, and the lighting and visuals fit the music to a T. Sound and picture quality are excellent. The performances are flawless from beginning to end. The guitar work is first-rate as is everything else. This is a definite must-have for any music lover, Floyd fan or not. You will be astounded! Classic.
B0000508U6|5.0|\\"Parachutes\\" is probably one of the best (the best?) CDs stemming from the english-rock scene. For me, these guys are much more talented than the members of Radiohead or Oasis (Blaaah!!!). Coldplay sounds sometimes like PINK FLOYD and it's damn good !!!    A GOOD CHOICE !!!
0767817478|1.0|My tale is a tragic one.  Back in 1997, I was putting in my final year as film critic for our high-school newspaper,The Apple Valley Sunshine Times. With exams looming and only a few short weeks to go in my stint as a high-school senior, I would soon be off pursuing my dream of becoming the world's foremost collector of antique rubber snakes.  Before that, though, I owed the paper one more review.  That review of course, was for \\"GODZILLA,\\" the big \\"event\\" picture of 1997.  Naturally,<br />being \\"press,\\" I was going to the \\"sneak,\\" and my classmates, while understandably envious, were still eager to hear my verdict on the summer's \\"big bopper.\\"  As you might expect, the theater was jammed to capacity, with a surprising number of females in attendance; I hadn't anticipated a movie about a \\"giant lizard\\" appealing to the fairer sex.  Anyhow, with popcorn and soda in hand, I settled into my customary back-row, center seat, heart-pumping as this hype-heavy, special-effects extravaganza began unspooling before my eyes...and THAT's where it all went wrong.  Almost immediately I realized WHY there were so many women in the audience - this wasn't a movie about a giant, [angry] lizard terrorizing the Big Apple, it was some \\"chick flick\\" starring Sandra Bullock - I was in the WRONG theater!<br />  Frantically, all sorts of scenarios began playing out  in my head.  Remember, I had a column due, and I had to deliver.  Because of my situation, I ill-advisedly decided to review the lizard picture sight-unseen; with all the hype, how could this film possibly miss?  Immediately my typewriter began birthing  quick, incisive catchphrases like, \\"GIGANTIC FUN!,\\" and \\"Bigger Than JAWS and ORCA combined!\\"  I truly thought I had pulled my fat from the fire.  Then, while I was still busy patting myself on the back, tragedy struck...<br />  It was the Monday after my column ran.  Based on my glowing enthusiasm for this new, improved GODZILLA, hundreds of my classmates had taken in the film over the weekend.  For those final weeks of my high school life, I was kicked, punched, and thrashed unmercifully by the other students.  Even members of the PTA, some of whom had accompanied their children to the see the film, beat me senseless.  Blaming me for wasting their allowances, many demanded, (and some more than once), that I refund the cost of their tickets, warning, \\"We know where you live...\\"<br />  That, in a nutshell, is why I say this movie ruined my life.  To this day, I still find myself looking over my shoulder, agonizing over the possibility that someone saw GODZILLA on my recommendation and is just waiting for the perfect opportunity tolm over the weekend.

B0000026CM|5.0|The late, great Jeff Porcaro was the best rock/pop drummer who's ever lived.  All the musicians are top-notch here, but it's Jeff who stands out.  Check out how TASTY he plays on this entire disc--especially the cuts &quot;These Chains&quot;, &quot;Mushanga&quot;, and &quot;Pamela&quot;.  No one else has ever set up such monster grooves, nor will they.  Jeff is sorely missed by fans of great drumming.
B00006LWSF|5.0|I own one of Eminem's CD's and I have always been a distant fan of his work but when I first heard a song off of this album (first song I heard was \\"Love Me\\" by Obie Trice, Eminem + 50 Cent) I knew that I would have to go seek the out the rest of the soundtrack. I am not as in-depth in Em's work as obvious die-hard Em fans are but I'd have to say that the work he did on this album has to be some of the best stuff I've heard from him as of yet. Also, the hype on the street of 50 Cent as well as the movie itself made me get this CD. What can I say.... The CD didn't disappoint at all!<br />1) For all the radio-airplay heads out there, you must've heard \\"Lose Yourself\\" many-a-times already. I like the song but it definitely isn't one of my favorites on the album. -3.5 outta 5<BR>2) \\"8 Mile\\" is a very deep track by Em and it is one of the better tracks on the CD. -4.5 outta 5<BR>3) One of my favorite tracks on the CD. \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" is just a straight-up hard track and Em totally goes off on this song. -5 outta 5<BR>4) \\"Love Me\\", another favorite of mine. Listen to 50 Cent's verse and you'll love this track too. -5 outta 5<BR>5) \\"Places to Go\\", a banging 50 Cent track. -4 outta 5<BR>6) \\"Wanksta\\", 50's upcoming 1st single is definitely a radio-banger. -4 outta 5<BR>7) \\"Rap Game\\" isn't really a track I've listened to a lot. Just not a big fan of D-12. 2.5 outta 5<BR>8) Nas's track on this CD is surprisingly sub-par for his standards. 3 outta 5 (solely on respect)<BR>9) \\"8 Miles and Running\\" is definitely a track I rock to. Freeway IMO is a great up-an-comer. Look out for him coming outta the Roc. 4 outta 5<BR>10) \\"That's My ....\\" is an ok track. I don't really roc it at all. 2 outta 5 <BR>11) \\"Battle\\" a pretty nice song. 3 outta 5<BR>12) Xzibit's song is another that I don't roc much. 3 outta 5<BR>13) \\"Time of Your Life\\", why is this on the CD again? Artist selection for this song coulda been way better. 1.5 outta 5<BR>14) I love Bookmat's song \\"Wasting My Time\\" I wasn'texpecting much from this one but I was thankfully surprised.

B00006LPIV|5.0|Fantastic acting, great story line, a disturbing and thought provoking film about the sexual awaking of a woman, verbally abused by her mother.  A prim and proper piano teacher, Isabelle Huppert spends her off time in porn shops and peep shows.  A brash young student captures her attention, and awakens her deepest and darkest sexual desires.  The unrated version is a must see for any Foreign film fan.
B000000W5P|4.0|You often hear this described as &quot;The Last Great Stones Album&quot;, which is laying it on a tad thick.  It's actually &quot;The Last Really Really Really Good Stones Album&quot;.  There's a difference.
B000002LR3|3.0|This album is without doubt one of the defining albums of the past ten years- and the weirdest.The band were off their rockers on speed making it. It is very inconsistent exploring many different genres of music and feelings.Even though i appreciate the art and genius of the album i cant say that i honestly enjoyed it but it is an intersing listen.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Being the skeptical nirvana fan that i am, i was strongly questioning getting this album. i thought it was a waste of money. Well, i took the dive and it was well worth it. This album has more good qualities than bad. \\"You Know You're Right\\" is a great raw song, the sound quality is great(i'll get back to this). \\"About a girl\\" sounds the same, but i'll forgive that. \\"Been A son\\" is off of the \\"BLew EP\\" and it is much better than the version released for \\"Incesticide\\". Its one of my favorites on here. Sliver is another song that sounds the same. However the tracks off of Nevermind (Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Lithium, Come As You Are) sound 100 times better than they did before. I nearly fell off of my bed when \\"In BLoom\\" blasted out of my speakers. These songs sound like they were recorded in 2002, i'd rather listen to these remasterings than the originals. \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" and \\"Rape Me\\" pretty much sound the same to me, maybe a little louder. \\"Dumb\\" is much more angelic sounding on this cd. The mix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is a nice way to listen to the song although it sort of lacks some of the bass it had on the studio version (but this version is more raw so i like it better). The unplugged tracks (All Apologies, The Man Who Sold The World) sound like they were recorded in the studio, totally amazing. the talking in between songs was edited out thankfully. The artwork and pictures for the cd were outstanding, although the liner notes could've came from a closer and more knowledgeable source (kurt wasnt to fond of rolling stone so its kind of stupid to get a rolling stone person to write liner notes for a nirvana album). I realize that not everyone can be pleased with a greatest hits album but my biggest complaint is that they could've put more songs on this cd (i.e. Drain You, Polly, Serve The Servents, Breed, Dive). If you call a cd \\"Nirvana\\", then you should put more defining songs on the album besides just the hits. Nirvana also had some punkish songs and some weirder songs that should've been included in my opinion. But this is nevertheless a worthwhile purchase and i suggest you buy it.some weirder songs that should've been included in my opinion.

B000003TAL|5.0|Daydream Nation is considered a classic album, but it never makes those \\"100 Greatest Albums\\" lists because they need to save room for the 18 Beatles albums that will undoubtedly be on there (Nothing against the Beatles, it's just like, \\"How many spaces do you need?!?\\"). Anyway, like I was saying, it's thought of as a classic album and rightfully so. Simply put, this is the most perfect collection of sounds I have ever heard. Everything on this album is exactly as it should be. A balance between chaos and structure. Blah, blah, blah. You know the deal. <BR> ***<BR>Another good thing about this album is that music snobs like it, so you can bring it up in casual conversation and be accepted into their elitist scene. Cos there's nothing cooler than hanging out with a guy who pretends to like Radiohead. And Sonic Youth influenced a lot of Grunge-era bands, so if you meet someone who's really into Nirvana or something, you can sniff and tell them how derivative you think Kurt Cobain and the Gang were.<BR> ***<BR>So ... shell out the $$. Trust me. It's worth it. Just promise to give it a couple listens before you make up your mind. Cos it's a really complex album like that. And if you don't like it? Well, forget you! Go listen to Papa Roach or something.
B00006CXXU|5.0|XTina's new album is brilliant! She really did her thing on this one!! There's a pure, raw energy on this album.  XTina's voice entices the ear, seduces the mic and exudes a sexy and sultry funkiness, all of it genuine and effortless.  She did her thing, put it down, wrote / co wrote the vast majority of the songs and it's truly refreshing to hear such a great deal of versatity in the all of her songs and to witness her capability to carry a note in ANY musical genre.  <br />Unlike her nemesis, Brittney, XTina is able to sing from a place much deeper than the soul (think Mary J. Blige, No More Drama).  No one can deny that Xtina can handle a multitude of ranges - she puts Mariah Carey to shame in a major way, just listen to The Voice Within!  She is able to go from an airy Minnie Ripperton-esque style of crooning on Loving Me 4 Me to soulful, gritty heartfelt vocals on Impossible, Soar, Underappreciated and Beautiful.  Equally refreshing is Make Over where she has a Pink-esque, watery - scratch thing going on. Not her usual style but she sounds incredible on the track!   Of course, Dirrty is destined to be a favorite dance track and the video is definitely hot!!!  Infatuation will probably follow is suit and maybe we'll be lucky enough to see a video for Can't Hold Us Down.  No doubt XTina and Lil Kim will be sure to have some fun with that video!<br />There are a lot of different styles going on this album but it can only force one to say, \\"Wow!  Look at ALL she can do!\\"  and sound great each time, no less.  This album is IMPRESSIVE!  Keep doing what you're doing XTina, no matter what they say...
B00006CXXU|5.0|She's had the most amazing voice!  I'm glad that she took the time to make an equally amazing cd.  Maybe now everyone will appeciate her talent like they should have from the start.  If you don't have it, you better go get it because pretty soon it's going to be a sin not to have it!!<BR>:)
B00005JKCH|5.0|I love Spiderman! It's the Best comic book movie ever made! Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker/Spiderman. Kristen Dunset is Mary Jane. William Defoe is the Green Goblin/Norman Osbourne. The Plot revolves around these characters and how they came to be! This is a very well written story with great dialogue and well written script. Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) are fantastic together! They have a wonderful chemistry in the film. This movie is a wonderful translation from the comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko to the silver screen! Buy it! Highly Recommended!
B00006IUL6|5.0|I'm actually reviewing the \\"Widescreen\\" version of Insomnia. But had to use the Full Screen link (none available on the Widescreen page at the time of review).<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, which features excellent performances (IMO) by the three leads (Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Williams, in a rare evil role).<br /><br />Pacino really gives you the impression he has insomnia here, looking pretty ragged around the edges for much of the picture. It's almost impossible (for me) to not like a Pacino picture.  He's great in just about everything. And this is no exception.<br /><br />The DVD's commentary tracks are rather unique. Director Nolan takes us through the film chronologically, in the order in which it was filmed, starting with Day 1 (which is Scene #111!).<br /><br />The other commentaries are scene specific, which I like much better than having to watch the entire movie a second time just for the commentaries, which are oft times filled with silence.  I wish every DVD had commentaries like the ones on \\"Insomnia\\".  Excellent!<br /><br />And how about that Easter Egg?!  Outstanding!  Clicking on that pencil next to Hilary in the \\"Production Diaries\\" area of the DVD will enable you to witness an avalanche that occurred during the film's production. The quick-thinking Wally Pfister (Insomnia's Director of Photography) was able to record the moment on video tape. We even get a glimpse of Hilary Swank at the end of this short clip, who comments on witnessing this unforseen event: \\"It was so awesome!\\"<br />This has got to be one of the coolest Eggs I've yet to encounter on a disc!<br /><br />All-in-all, a Grade-A film and DVD presentation.
B00006V9A0|4.0|4 Stars for MUSIC 1 Star for Record Company<br />I love Nirvana, however I am very sad that the record company chose to put only one un-released track on it 'YOU KNOW YOUR RIGHT' and failed to even make that song available as a single.<br />The best thing they could have done was do it as a 2CD set with the best of on Disc 1 and have disc 2 as a rariries CD b-sides etc such as the U2 compilations.<br />At least this would have made it worth bying for the fans who already have all Nirvana CDs.<br />I hope this doesn't become another Jimi Hendrix saga re-re-releases etc for the next 30 years of the same old songs.
0446677450|3.0|Mr. Kiyoski's book has been a staple of the bestseller lists for a long time now.  This is what prompted me to read his book, thinking something must be good.<br />I am not sure of Mr. Kiyoski's premise is real or not, but his &quot;dad&quot; is a man who is the father of one of his friends who is wealthy.  &quot;Dad&quot; spends all of his time giving his son and Mr. Kiyoski important financial lessons.<br />The lessons in this book are so simple, it is almost amazing that this book was published.  Many of the lessons are similar to &quot;in order to be wealthy, you have to save more money than you spend.&quot;  <br />Conversely, Kiyoski does a good job of breaking down the fundamental principles of Finance for those who are not familiar with the subject.  In this sense, it is a good start, but I would not read this book expecting any earth shattering financial revelations.<br />I really wish that my dad would have told me that I could turn one book into a series, workbooks, informercials, and seminars.  Congratulations to Mr. Kiyoski for being successful for repackaging the same financial information that we have heard for years.
B00006IUOZ|4.0|Very few films have the courage to face only one aspect of the human condition and to build a plot based on that.  Director Chris Nolan takes the Norwegian book of the same name and transforms it into a metaphorical casting of light that illuminates the inevitable results of what happens when integrity is cast aside for expediency.  Al Pacino plays L. A. detective Will Dormer, who is called to aid in a murder investigation of a young high school girl in Alaska.  During the course of the film, the viewer learns that Dormer in under investigation by the L. A. internal affairs unit for having planted evidence to convict a sex criminal.  Dormer is the sort of scum-hating cop who feels that the ends sometimes justifies the means in keeping creeps off the streets.  Unlike other cop movies with a similar theme, Pacino invests his Dormer character with the sort of world-weary crisis of conscience that he had shown before as the aging Michael Corleone in GODFATHER III. Director Nolan uses the magnificent colors and sights of a land that knows no night to represent the brightness of a moral compass that Dormer sought, even back in L. A., to put him back on track.  It is no surprise then that from the moment that he arrives in Alaska, he suffers from the insomnia of the title. As he tries to solve the murder of a young girl, he is reminded of his own failings on two levels.  First by the light of the landscape that by contrast points out his earlier moral shortcomings, then later by the appearance of the real killer, Will Finch, played effectively by Robin Williams, who in his most recent films seems determined to eschew the comedy of his youth in favor of dark roles just like this one. Dormer and Finch are moral dopplegangers, not so much as two sides of a criminal coin, but as a coin with only one side.  More than once, Finch points out that if an accidental killing results in a benefit to society, then the architect of that killing ought to be lauded, not punished, for it.Pacino hears this argument and is strongly leaning to accepting it.  But like Raskolnikov in CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, Dormer is prodded by his conscience in the form of Hillary Swank, who plays a policewoman who is bright enough to learn that the hero cop of her youth may also be a cop who now finds himself on the same moral plane as any other killer who seeks to justify killing solely on the basis of expediency.  What emerges from INSOMNIA is a call that is as bright and clear as the shiny landscapes of Alaska.  Truth is a beacon of light whose only purpose is to dispel the darkness of the immorality of sin.  And when each of us is faced with the choice of living in light or darkness, then Dormer warns us to make the right choice, or we may lose our way.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|I really rate this soundtrack at around 3.5 stars, but I wanted to be fair and give it four stars.  I am not into rap as much as I used to be.  Or at least none of the new rap that's out there.  There are a few I listen to, and one of them is Eminem.  He's really the main reason why I bought the CD.  I loved the song \\"lose yourself.\\"  And the other two songs he does by himself are also really good.<br />The three solo songs by Eminem, which are \\"lose yourself,\\" \\"8 mile,\\" and \\"rabbit run,\\" are really worth the price of the CD.  Especially \\"lose yourself.\\"  I don't even know how many times in total I have listened to that song in the short matter of time that I have had this CD in my possession.  He just seems to improve each time.  He is one hell of a lyricist, and he never ceases to amaze me.<br />The soundtrack also includes songs by Xzibit, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, D-12, Nas, Jay-Z, Rakim, and many more.  I like the songs by D-12, Xzibit, Nas, Jay-Z, and Obie Trice.  Marcy Gray is on the CD too.  ...P>I don't know if this is included in all of them, but the version I got has two CDs.  The second CD is an Aftermath Sampler that includes 6 tracks.  The songs by Obie Trice and Eminem are really good.  The rest, however, aren't really as good.  Still, it's a nice little extra.<br />So all in all, \\"8 Mile,\\" is a pretty fair soundtrack.  Really should get a 3.5 rating, but the three songs by Eminem alone that I mentioned are worth the four stars.  If you really enjoy rap, then chances are that you'll enjoy the soundtrack.  Like I said, I'm not the big rap fan that I was in high school.  I still enjoy it every now and then.  While it's an okay soundtrack, the three songs by Eminem makes the whole album worth the price, or at least that's how I feel.  If you are a big rap fan, then you should give this CD a try.
6305546789|3.0|I am probobly one of the very few people you are gonna hear this from, I thought this movie was boring and I would much rather watch Friday the 13th. I bought this movie because everybody said it was so good but I don't really see what the fuss was all about. I did enjoy the other Halloween movies but not this one. A lot of people say the beginning was scary when Micheal was 6 yrs old and killed his sister. That scene was so not scary, he walked right up to the girl and stabbed her a few times. Atleast in Friday the 13th things would happen unexpectedly. And what made things more boring was that the halloween theme came up every 2 minutes through out the movie, I was really getting sick of that music. And then there was that scene where he killed the character Lynda by strangling her throat with a telephone cord. You can't strangle a person with a telephone cord, the thing can stretch for god's sake and not only that PJ Soles who played Lynda said she was about to laugh while shooting that scene because the cord was tickeling her throat. And there was stuff in this movie that wasn't totally explained until the sequel which was made 3 yrs after. You never really know why Micheal is killing these people other then the fact he is just a mental patient but they never explained why he was mainly after Jaimie Lee Curtis until Halloween 2. I personally think the only good and scary part in this movie was when Micheal attacked Lynda's boyfriend but I didn't get scared because I first saw that clip in the movie SCREAM which was before I saw Halloween so I was kind of was expecting that to happen.<br />Any way I really did not enjoy this movie at all. I liked Friday the 13th movies more mainly because they take place in the woods and I like Jason more then Micheal. Although I do have to admit I think Jason is a copy Micheal and a person I know said to me that probobly if it wasn't for Micheal, they would have never had the idea of Jason. I don't reccomend this movie but comparing to other reviewers, I don't have much of an argument that this is a bad movie. Afterall it did win an award, I can't argue against that. This is just what I thought of this movie, I'm pretty sure there is another review out there that is gonna make just want to own this. if you want this movie then get it, don't let this review stop you, I am just writing this so people can see what I thought of it. I do however really reccomend Halloween 2,4,5, and 8 cuz I thought those ones were good.ring to other reviewers, I don't have much of an argument that this is a bad movie.

B000006045|5.0|. . . and that's why this is my favorite album from them by far.  Dark moods, pulsing beats - trip-hop is mysterious, sexy and trips your brain out.  Massive is totally keyed into that on MEZZANINE.  All songs are great although some obviously stand out, but even the less engaging ones are far from objectionable and fill the album out nicely.  <br />\\"Teardrop\\" must be one of the most beautiful songs EVER and features vocals by the uniquely expressive Elizabeth Faser of the Cocteau Twins.  \\"Man Next Door\\" is a particularly strange one, slowing down and manipulating samples from an old Cure song to a hallucinatory effect. Meanwhile, \\"Exchange\\" offers some respite with a more relaxed calm.  <br />P.S. - this is another album that's great to put on as \\"mood music\\" with your \\"significant other.\\"

B00000JHAU|5.0|I'm not going to go into details on each song, since other earlier reviews have already done that. Suffice it to say that I will always have a soft spot for certain albums (can't stop calling them that..). This is one of a few that I know I will never tire of. I honestly enjoy every single song and they all seem fresh every time I play them or try to initiate someone else into the cabal. It takes you to a certain place, a time in your life, that's about the best way I can describe it. &quot;Seeing Other People&quot;, &quot;Mayfly&quot;, &quot;Get me Away from Here..&quot;, and the title track stand out above the rest. Yeh, they sound a lot like Simon and Garfunkel, as my wife never fails to point out, but I really don't care. Buy it and treasure it.. I love all their other releases but this one is the most consistent.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Let's make it short with one word: MASTERPIECE.<BR>Buy it or fry in Hell!
B00006CXXU|4.0|It took Christina Aguilera a long time to create the follow up to her multi platinum self titled debut from 1999. Now over 3 years later she is back with STRIPPED. Scantily clad in the \\"Dirrty\\" video, the album's first single, she is making a statement. However don't let the image fool you, that song stands on its own on STRIPPED. The other songs can also stand on their own, but the album lends itself to many genres. Jazz, R&B, soul, a bit of rock, and more. Vocally she does not disapoint, something about her voice is captivating and draws the listener in. The subject matter of the CD is pretty personal. Although \\"Dirrty\\" is a party type anthem, the other songs deal with things such as childhood pain, self esteem, standing up for yourself and more. The album has 16 tracks and 4 interludes, which actually fit well on the album. Christina worked with various producers such as Glen Ballard, Linda Perry, and more. Christina wrote many of the tracks, and also served as executive producer. So before you judge the album based on that one song, that one video, you should listen to the album. My favorite tracks include the jazzy \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", the inspiring \\"The Voice Within\\", the inspirational \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\", \\"Walk Away\\" and the tragically sad \\"I'm OK\\". I didn't really care for the rock based tracks, like \\"Make Over\\", they just didn't suit her vocals I felt. But there's something for everyone here. It's a nicely crafted album that gives us insight to Christina and who she really is.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|Overall I would have to say that this is a good compilation of some up and coming, established and classic artists. Eminem's songs definitely stand out from the crowd, but there are a number of others worth mentioning.<br />My favorite Eminem track would have to be \\"Lose Yourself\\". I don't listen to the radio, so it's still fresh in my mind, and not played out yet. My second favorite would have to be \\"Rabbit Run\\". It's 3+ minutes of Eminem on the mic without a chorus.<br />Others worthwhile tracks include \\"Love Me\\", a collabo with Eminem/Obie Trice/50 Cent, \\"8 Miles And Runnin'\\" by Jay-Z & Freeway and \\"R.A.K.I.M.\\" by, you guessed it, Rakim.<br />There are however some tracks I could've done with out. Example, \\"Time Of My Life\\" by Macy Gray. I'm sure the song carries some relevance in the movie, but it didn't really fit the flow of the album.<br />If you like Eminem, you should definitely pick this CD up, plus the Limited Edition includes 'The Shady/Aftermath Sampler' with an unreleased track from Eminem, \\"Stimulate\\", and a 50 Cent freestyle over the \\"'Til I Collapse\\" beat.

B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is the scariest movie I've ever seen. Me and 9 of my friends watched this at 11:00pm and it scared the ... out of all of us. We all agree that it is the scariest movie. I think the 2nd scariest movie I've seen is Repulsion, or The Changeling. Oh well, this takes top honors in my book. What makes this even scarier is hat it is based on a true story! I suggest watching this forst, alone in the dark, after it ends(or after you recover) watch the movie called Possessed and see what inspired this movie. Have a wonderfully scary time!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This new album by Christina takes you on a ride through her life as it's been lately and what a hell of a ride it is. Using every genre that has held her interests in her young short life, Christina not only sets herself apart with her diverse vocal range, but she also sets her album apart from the rest with the many different sounds coming through your speaker. Everything from rock, pop, R&B, hip hop,and yes even the blues. All used to tell her story, which is the common theme.<BR>Christina will take you up with \\"Soar\\" and bring you back down with \\"A Voice Within,\\"she will make you laugh and be silly with \\"Makeover,\\" and she will make you want to cry with \\"I'm OK.\\" With the song \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" she makes you want to get down and dirty and with \\"Dirrty\\" well let's just say that a much needed shower is next. <BR>There is something to be enjoyed by all on this album. I highly recommend it to true music lovers, it's a must for any record collection.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This album may very well be Sigur Ros's most important album to date, in the sense that it showcases their ability to progress.  Needless to say, the possibility of surpassing their previous effort, Agaetis Byrjun, seems close to impossible, but this album matches its superiority.  It has different dimensions; the album can be enjoyed equally as a whole or as individual songs.  It seems that the band focused less on trying to put its listeners into a trance-like state of meditation, and tried instead to explore the deepest parts of themselves and make their listeners do likewise.  The album is much more concise and less whimsical, and the band skips the long atmospheric interludes between songs, giving the listener a series of lush mental landscapes instead of a single one with different levels.  All of the songs are beautiful, as always, but the band tries different sounds to expand their sonic pallette.  Jonsi's use of a cello bow on guitar strings is still there, but less apparent than on Agaetis Byrjun.  Harmonies are added in all the right places, making already gorgeous songs even more breathtaking.  The album does have a much darker atmosphere surrounding it, making it work on a different level with the listener.  The title is symbolic of the album's structure, with the two parentheses representing the first and second halves of the album.  The first has an altogether happier sound, with track 4, Njosnavelin, taking the spotlight.  It was a track that has long been anticipated for studio recording, and this version far outshines that of the long-popular live version.  Track 3 probably best represents the first half, showing the aura of the band in a much calmer state.  The second half, prefaced by a silent interlude, is extremely dark and sad, with perhaps the exception of track 8.  It's like the album is falling in and out of love with somebody.  The structure can be interpreted in many different ways, so I leave that up to each individual listener.  If thisreview seems nonsensical, it's due to the fact that the band's music is so hard to pin down and explain, especially since I've only had the album for a day.  It is equally as amazing as Agaetis Byrjun, but on a different level.  It is darker, heavier, and more concise than its predecessor, which does not make it any better or worse.  If you are a fan of Radiohead, Bjork, Godspeed You Black Emperor, or Brian Eno, I HIGHLY recommend this band.  They craft a sound that is surreal, trance-inducing, and altogether beautiful, and are a welcome escape from the rehashed, redundant, uninspiring, and just plain horrible world of &quot;mainstream music&quot;.  Sigur Ros has arrived, and no insomniac is safe.
B00000G3Q4|1.0|It is stupid, not scary . The only horrible<BR>thing is the acting. A complete waste of time.
B00005221L|5.0|Without a doubt, Predator stands as one of my favorite films of the 1980s and perhaps, of all time. Director John McTierman skillfully crafts a fast-paced action science fiction film set in the steamy, unforgiving jungles of South America that pits an experienced bunch of US Army commandos against a solitary alien hunter. Arnold Schwarzenegger leads a cast of relative unknowns and a few familiar faces, including former wrestler and the current (Not for long! ed.) Governor of my state, Minnesota, Jesse Ventura and the equally hunky, Carl Weathers on a rescue mission when they are called up to go after a cabinet minister whose helicopter has crashed behind enemy lines. What they find are a squad of Green Berets who have been left hanging from trees and skinned alive. Schwarzenegger, as Major ``Dutch'' and the rest of his team are perplexed by this unusual turn of events.<br />What they learn is that there is no cabinet minister, rather a CIA operation to foil a Soviet-led communist insurgence into a neighboring nation and that Dutch's team was misled into stopping it. What also become very apparent is that whoever or whatever skinned the Green Berets has now taken an interest in them. McTierman's grasp of action and pacing is probably second only to James Cameron's. At first the action is sporadic, culminating in the first half of the film with a huge gunfight between Dutch's team and the guerillas, but it tapers off as the team realizes that they are being hunted and picked off one by one by the Predator. Hawkins' gets it first, followed by Ventura''s mini-gun toting Blaine, shot through the back by the Predator's plasma gun. The team quickly organizes in an attempt to make it safely to the drop zone without any more loss of life.<br />I found a great many similarities in Predator and McTierman's later film, the 13th Warrior, with both films possessing great strengths in both characterization, style and energy. Both films have in abundance a large cast of characters,all of whom are for the part, very likeable and an air of creepiness as the surreal intrudes on the real. There is a huge contrast between Predator's cast of commandos and those found in Resident Evil- when one of Dutch's men is lost, you feel disappointed. McTierman also likes night shooting, but that doesn't mean darkness, rather as a backdrop for spectacular pyrotechnics and fires that go a long way to lighting the action. He handles it all superbly. The final battle between Dutch and the Predator is finely crafted tour de force as Dutch pits his experience and intelligence against that of a foe equipped with advanced technology and no small amount of its own experience.<br />One of the aspects of the two Predator films, the Aliens series, the Terminator movies and to some extent, RoboCop (1 and 2, but not 3), is the mythology that grows up around them. All four series have, to one degree or another, an ``expanded universe'' in much the same way that both Star Wars and Star Trek do, albeit much smaller. Whether it be comics, novels, or video games. There was even a project at 20th Century Fox to make an Aliens-Predator crossover film which generated considerable excitement at the time, but unfortunately, never actually happened. About the only thing we did get were two Aliens vs. Predator games. Mores the pity. I'm also hoping Predator 2: Body Count makes it on to DVD soon. I always hope that there will be another Predator film, because the series is too much fun and too interesting to simply be allowed to fade away into nothing.
0812550706|5.0|The beginning of the great Ender's series. Card simply pulls you into the story. You'll feel the characters. This is one of those rare books that you can truly say &quot;That was incredible&quot; after you read it. I recommended it to several people and they all love it and went to get the other books in the series. So try it out!
0060090383|4.0|Although this is not a work of non-fiction, Marian Keyes gives wonderful insights into the life of an addict and what the course of recovery may be like.  Throughout the course of the novel, Ms. Keyes keeps our interest and sparks our imagination to anticipate all that has happened to Rachel and where she may end up.  I read this relatively long book in a matter of hours based on my desire to see where the story would go.  Quite a wonderful read and you may learn something to boot.

She is in a genre all of her own. \\"Stripped,\\" breaks all boundries and goes beyond any other artists attempts in writing their own lyrics for their own cd.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I had liked Christina and her songs okay in the past. Recently I have really disliked her public image. So, when I was online and came across a sight with a couple of her new songs I thought I would give them a listen, but did not have high hopes.  To my suprise I really enjoyed them (Beautiful and Impossible).  I bought the album because I liked these songs.  To my suprise when I put the album in I liked almost every single one of the 16 tracks (not too crazy about some of the interludes).  My favorites are the above mentioned songs, Walk Away, I'm okay, Fighter, Cruz, and Get Mine Get Yours.  Though there are many different styles on the album, I found myself enjoying listening to Christina try them all on.  There is something for everyone on this album.  Especially if you, like me, love different types of music.  The lyrics all have meaning and touch on things everyone has experienced and felt at one time or another. Some songs make you want to get up and dance and others make you want to sit still and just enjoy. Please don't miss out on this album!  It is truely a beautiful thing.
0385503954|5.0|At the center of this incredible novel are the two daughters of Emily and Jack Tallis. As the book opens in 1935, Briony is 13 years of age, and her sister Cecilia is 23. Robbie Turner, who works in the estate gardens, becomes the lover of Cecilia. The first part of the novel shows us the participants in minute detail, examining past and future aspiration to form complete character studies. The summer day starts rather bucolic, but quickly starts to disintegrate as personalities clash and grate on each other. At night, one of the young female guests is raped, and Briony points her finger at Robbie. Thus Robbie is convicted and sentenced to two years in jail.<br />The second part of the book takes place in May of 1940. Cecilia has become a registered nurse, and Briony just started as a learning nurse. Robbie is part of the British Expeditionary Force, trying to get to Dunkirk and back to England. The description of this retreat is an incredible piece of literature. The reader feels like he is there, suffering through the combat and choking on its details. One  is tempted to believe that the author writes from personal experience. Shortly thereafter the author describes the life of a training nurse during war time. Again, he gives us details that are fascinating and gives us endless respect for these caring women.<br />...Warning! This novel is written incredibly well as to imagination,<BR>language and style. It may well spoil for you many books you read thereafter, making them look superficial, shallow and sloppy.

0316666343|5.0|Excellent! Moving. Sentimental. Heartwrenching. A view from heaven of a chilling experience. Heartbreaking yet soul-moving. Best of all, like he book &quot;West Point...&quot; by Remick (a similar presentation I also loved), Sebold beautifully uses a unique and fascinating method of presentation. Try not to miss this.
B000002J20|5.0|This album is brilliant.  Though played by a \\"rock-n-roll\\" band, it has more in common with Johannes Brahms than Elvis Presley.  Frankly, in my opinion, it is degrading to compare it with any rock musician or song.  It is a masterfully composed and performed 4-movement symphony that, in my opinion, rivals Brahms, no outshines Brahms, in complexity, beauty, passion, joy, sublimity, harmony.....<br />It is the opposite of sugar-coated pop music.  There are no chorus(es).  Rather it is a winding weave of intricate themes which develop slowly and dramatically and eventually climax ecstatically, yet profoundly.<br />Listening to this music is less like listening, more like swimming in beautiful textures, rich tapestries.<br />Don't misunderstand:  it is not so complex or lofty that it takes a genius to appreciate.  i'm a simple soul.  if you appreciate quality, i think you'll appreciate this music.  only it may take several listenings to appreciate it.  i thought it was [terrible] the first few times through.<br />Play it 3 or 4 times all the way through, in the background while you're doing other things.  Then as it becomes familiar, as the previous reviewer suggested, get a good glass of wine and turn the lights dim, lay back, close your eyes and listen attentively.  Let this musick wrap you up and take you to another place.<br />i think i would consider it the highest quality music (of the music i've heard) since 1900.  it's closest rivals are Rachmaninov and Pink Floyd.<br />Enjoy!
0393039765|5.0|I went to the library to see if they had Lullaby available yet. They didn't. So merely to get acquainted with Chuck Palahniuk, I checked out Fight Club.<br />I had no interest in seeing the movie when it came out. I did end up seeing part of it (and being taken in from about halfway into the movie) because my friend's daughter was watching it while I happened to be over. So I was sort of familiar with the story, but didn't know what to expect from the book.<br />I was blown away. I read the book in the space of four days. I couldn't put it down. It was everything it promised on the back cover: dark, nihilistic, and funny. Laugh-out-loud funny.<br />The book left me thinking: who is the most disturbed? The narrator, Tyler Durden, or Chuck Palahniuk?<br />I can't wait to see the movie (all of it from start to finish) and to read all of CP's other books.<br />The first rule of Fight Club is to read Fight Club.
B000000H5K|5.0|Ok..this is Roots,alot of people call it the Korn album,dont get me wrong,its not they're best,Beneath The Remains i would pick for the best,but still,where do you hear the korn in this?.it has some riffs that Korn would do,but its way heavier than Korn,The riffs arent really that fast.but they're heavy,and of course Max Cavalera's vocals own(as they always did),but this is a good cd.not the best.but damn good
0553573403|1.0|Disapointed again.I am not a great fan of the fantasy genre but I very much enjoyed reading Tolkien,LeGuin &amp; c.s.lewis.Obviously this Author is being paid by the word &amp; has spent too much time writing fo TV; the characters are as flat as a sceen &amp; the plot could use a commercial every !0 pages or so.A pity the basic ideas did not occur to a more creative writer.
B000000H4V|5.0|In my opinion,this is better than Arise,I love Arise,Beneath The Remains is my fav,but this had alot more to it than Arise did,more slam riffs,and so on,the best tracks are \\"Refuse.Resist,Territory,Slave New World,Amen,Propaganda,Manifest,Nomad,Clenched fist.
B0000028WD|4.0|This is an excellent albumn with soem really great cuts on it.  Eddie Vedder stays true to the original, yet his voice fills out \\"Masters of War\\" wonderfully.  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are excellent on \\"Lisence to Kill.\\" Eric Clapton knows how to do the blues and brings some of that to \\"Don't think Twice it's alright.\\" Both discs have a couple weaker performances but it is well worth it.
B00003CXP1|5.0|It was weird reading everyone else's reviews to this especially the fellow that was comparing it to movies like LOTR and Aliens and how horrible the movie is in comparison to those movies.  <br />I have lived the experience of the people in the movie/book being a former junkie myself.  Hearing people say it it is sensationalist and overbearing and unrealistic...well that is complete BS.  I have never seen a movie or read a book that protrays addiction so realisticly as Requiem For a Dream.  It also makes out the people to be real people with hopes and dreams and then the addiction crushes all of there hopes.  When I read the book I wondered how Selby was able to know exactly what it feels like.  <br />I couldn't explain the emotions I felt.  The movie made me sick, made me think of my former friends many of them who ended up like the charcters in the movie.  I was depressed for a long time after watching this.  The situations in the movie may be 'stereotypical' as some reviews say but that is only because addiction is 'stereotypical'.<br />So for those of you who would like a movie where eveyrone ends up happy or you would like some unrealistic glorification of people that become junkies then go rent a Hollywood movie becuase you won't like this one.  Sure the movie may be a little harsh on drug use since drug use does not always lead to addiction but for those that do become addicted this movie tells many of there stories.  I've only found a few things in the book/movie that were far-fetched.
B000002L9W|5.0|Diamond Dave and Sammy Hagar recently toured together. They still don't like each other, but they had a decent outing. Sammy Hagar said in an interview, \\"Dave was in the gutter before this tour, and he will be back were he was next year.\\" It's sad, but very true. Dave has never been able to get along with people, and so he has suffered for it. Sammy Hagar has had a great solo career before and after his Van Halen stint. Dave has not. This was his debut album. It showed a very tight band. Dave was writing good songs and was still a great frontman. He could have had a great career, but his ego has left him out in the cold. He showed this past summer, that he still has great talent, and if he can put together a decent band again, he should be a populer concert draw. This is a great album. It's not quite as good as a Hagar album, but David was just starting out on his own, and he made a good first album.

0451191153|5.0|I just finished my third reading of The Fountainhead.  My first time was in my early 20's when I absorbed little beyond the wonderful love story; my second reading was in my late 40's, and this time I was jolted into digging deeper into the philosophy of the book.  I'm now in my late 60's, and finally really understand what Ayn Rand was saying in this outstanding book. Because she had firsthand experience, Rand has given us a clear picture of the never-ending stuggle between good and evil in the form of capitalistic versus communistic/fascistic philosophy.<br />Having lived for a time in a socialistic country has given me an even better understanding of how dangerous it is to allow either government or man to attempt to breed the idea of individual thinking out of a society.<br />With all of our troubles, we Americans must continue to be on guard against the liberal factions that don't mind if it takes another fifty years to acquire power over us through our individual thinking.<br />Read Ayn Rand's writings and you will see why I call her my heroine.
B00006C79E|5.0|It flows like a movie in front of your eyes, the kind of movie you'll like to watch again and again. It's the magic of Saint Etienne, it's Finisterre (have you ever been there? ...there are at least 3 places in  Europe called Finisterre, with slightly different names depending on the country they sit in). It's Mademoiselle Sarah Cracknell, back with her godgifted modulations.<BR>The boys are playing new instruments, it all sounds more modern, and it's a new Saint Etienne classic, with a narrating voice that leads you through the Suburbia, its public mythification and private dreams. Danceable hopings.<br />&quot;Finisterre&quot; is an audiomatic opera that confirms us that sometimes there's nothing as beautiful as buying a piece of magic plastic.
B000066NW0|4.0|I really like this cd but some times she sounds like she has an acent. Other times she over sings or is a little off key. Other than that It is a great cd! I listen to it all the time! I thank it is a really good deal and would make the perfect gift!
0790732254|5.0|Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor do a superb job transferring this classic stage production to the silver screen. I'm sure Edward Albee would be pleased. The utter turmoil between George (Burton) and Martha (Taylor), and the fact that the majority of the film takes place in a small parlor, gives the viewer a feeling of claustrophobia and discomfort. Only two superior actors could pull it off.<br />The conflict between the two begins with the opening credits and increases in its ferocity through out the picture, finally culminating in the final reveling scene.<br />While reading the reviews, I was surprised to find very few comments on this very important last scene...where we discover the truth behind the mysterious son of Martha and George. This is the root cause of some of the most savage dialogue in the film, and should not be taken lightly.<br />This movie is certainly worth purchasing as it can be seen a number of times, and only increases in its profundity. It gets better and better with each viewing.
B000003TA4|5.0|Back in 1991, NEVERMIND exploded onto the sad, dreary musical scene that we had to put off with. NIRVANA mixed the rage and fury of punk with some killer rock riffs and just killed all the 80's [bad] bands that we had to deal with. Overnight, the face of music was changed forever and this album was the main cause of this. Sadly, to many bands have tried to copy this sound and now this album might sound commonplace, but it started the revolution. I can remember being in the barracks back in my army days and just blasting this disc for blast as me and my friends just partied the night away. With killer songs such as SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT, IN BLOOM, COME AS YOU ARE, BREED, LITHIUM, POLLY, TERRITORIAL PISSINGS,DRAIN YOU, what more can you ask for in an album.  We will never know what might have become of this band, but what we have here shows us just for a moment how great music can be again.
B00005JL0I|4.0|I'm a big fan of Peter Sellers but hadn't heard of Casino Royale until finding the DVD at my local video store.  The film certainly didn't disappoint.  The characters are great, especially Peter Sellers and David Niven.  I was most surprised to see Woody Allen, William Holden, and Orson Welles making smaller, but no less entertaining appearances.  The film did have a certain discontinuity, but with four separate directors attempting to blend their individual talents, this is to be expected.  As a Bond spoof, some may compare the film to the modern day Austin Powers movies, but the Mike Meyers creations don't hold a candle to this 1960's classic.
B000003TAR|4.0|After the success of NEVERRMIND, NIRVANA went back into the studio to do the follow up. What we were offered was IN UTERO. An album that to me sounds almost nothing like NEVERMIND, and that is not a complaint. This album has alot of feedback screaming through the speakers. somewhat darker lyrics and some slower down-tempo songs that rock. SERVE THE SERVANTS, SCENTLESS APPRENTICE, HEART-SHAPED BOX, RAPE ME. FARMER FRANCIS, DUMB are great songs on this album that the listener should enjoy and play very loud. The one song off this album that really sticks out above all the others is the last song on the album, ALL APOLOGIES. The song is sad, but Kurt is really singing his tail off, and the melody to this song is just amazing. If for no other reason, this is a reason to but the album. While this album is no NEVERMIND, it is still a worthy addition to your collection even almost 10 years after its release.

B000005IU2|5.0|This terrific LP is pure catharsis. The chords are simple and rudimentary, the sound is barely contained (Don Gallucci produced this and wisely left all the mistakes and flaws in) so the instruments bleed all over each other and Iggy Stooge howls like a man possessed by....something, but it all somehow makes perfect sense. The Asheton Brothers are an airtight rhythm section and Bassist James Williamson actually has a great sense of melody and precision. The sqawking, jarringly dissonant and chaotic closer &quot;L.A. Blues&quot; is reason alone to own this LP. &quot;funhouse&quot; is for adventurous listeners only.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ah, what else can I say besides I agree with the person who was upset that this album isn't 5/5 stars. One of the points he/she said was that the people who were criticizing it probably have never even heard this brilliant album or listened once and threw it out. Well, personally, I can testify to this. It took me a good six listens to appreciate the innovation of \\"OK Computer\\" and the same with \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac.\\" Through multiple listens comes enjoyment, unless you have the attention span of a three year old. Some of the critics of this album sound more pompous than they claim for the album itself to be. Anyway, enough of the complaining, onto the album - <br />Airbag - One of my personal favorites in the Radiohead catalogue, it's an optomistic opener, and I love the line \\"In an interstellar burst, I am back to save the universe.\\" <br />Paranoid Android - This one would take awhile to appreciate. Fans of Linkin Park will dismiss the song once it slows down after the intense guitars, but it only opens the depth of the song. The \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\" tactic works beautifully...I got the album because of this song, which also took awhile to get into. Pattern?<br />Subterranean Homesick Blues - Dylan homage, yes...peaceful and interesting, with the chorus crescendoing and such. Not that special, but still very good.<br />Exit Music (For a Film) - Powerful. Very powerful. Definitely unlike anything you'd hear on the radio these days, with mainly Thom Yorke's voice wailing out. Great theme of two lovers escaping the daily life.<br />Let Down - I can't get into this as much as some of the other tracks, because it's a little bit bland. It's not bad (nothing is on OKC.) <br />Karma Police - Most people know this song and indeed it's one of the better songs. The piano is very cool and the lyrics are satirical, as many RH songs are. Check this out if you want a taste of the band.<br />Fitter Happier - This is not Stephen Hawking! Ahhh!! Filler, yeah, but try and listen to the lyrics once or twice. <br />Electioneering - Guitars, yes! One could argue the immense talent of Jonny Greenwood is wasted in \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" and it's not too prominent in this album either. This is another radio-friendly song and the catchiest in my opinion.<br />Climbing up the Walls - Scary, no, but a bit freaky. The lyrics make this song, I didn't like it until I read the lyrics. The story behind it is good, check out greenplastic.com for it. Good Greenwood guitar solo...hauntingly good song.<br />No Surprises - Calm, catchy, a bit sad. I can't think of much else to say.<br />Lucky - Another of my favorites. The guitar is great, the story is great, the emotion is at a high. \\"We are standing on the edge...\\"<br />The Tourist - This, along with most other RH albums, is a powerful finisher. It's got a gloomy aura but manages to be optomistic. The climbing guitar and vocals towards the end climaxing and fading out to the \\"ding\\" of the bell is classic.<br />Overall - easy 5 stars. One of the best albums i've ever heard. Check it out, and give it five listens. If you don't have an open mind, stick to the bland stuff. Radiohead is the greatest band around since Pink Floyd and OK Computer is (so far) their best work. Here's hoping the May '03 album can top it! :)
B00000425L|5.0|Ashkenazy's performance of the 2nd Rachmaninov sonata is much more gratifying than Horowitz's, in part because he plays the earlier version of this piece.<BR>The preludes are fantastic, played with sensitivity and with those deliberate and well-thought out interpretations which make Ahskenazy such a wonderful performer. He's also able to play with amazing voicing, making the entire set sound amazingly clear from top to bottom.
B00006LWSF|3.0|When I heard that sons Lose Yourself on the radio I was hooked, so I had to get the soundtrack. But unfortunatley that is about as good as it gets. The song Rap Game by D12 is also nice, but the rest isn't really impressive. 50 cent does an ok job, and Jay'Z too, but like the Obie Trice song and others alike are just weak, nothing I'd listen to more than once.
B00006J9OV|5.0|There are currently only two versions of Parsifal available on DVD and this video of a Metropolitan Opera production is better musically than Hans-Jürgen Syberberg's movie version which is lip-synched by actors as well as opera singers.  While Syberberg's movie is more politically and sexually charged (the flower maidens are naked) and his sets are quite imaginative, the Prague Philharmonic doesn't match the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra nor do the singers come up to the Met's cast.<br />This video is of a March 1992 production at the MET.  The sets are naturalistic and conservative but very impressive.  Having seen the production live I can say that the video does a good job of capturing it.  Audience noise is minimal but the crowd insists on clapping before the music stops at the end of Act II - a regular, if annoying, ritual at the MET. Some portions of the orchestral shots appear to have been made without an audience present - the spectacular camera angles taken from a boom hovering over the orchestra could never haven been filmed during an actual performance.  A minor quibble - the offstage chorus at the end of Act I sounds off the beat and out of tune.  They are better at the end of Act III.<br />The SOUND on this DVD is superb.  It is offered in PCM stereo, DOLBY DIGITAL, and DTS.  Playback in DOLBY DIGITAL is natural with deep but not obtrusive bass; also there is no artifically distracting audio coming from the rear speakers.  Presumably DTS is even better but I don't have it.<br />The picture is free of video artifacts, colors natural, and the image is especially detailed in scenes where the cameras were precisely in focus (quite a feat during a live opera production). Annoying was a break in the audio along with a jump in the picture in the middle of Act I on disc 1 and near the end of the orchestral prelude to Act III on disc 2.  I believe this is indicative of the laser beam moving from one layer of the disc to another and may not be noticeable on newerDVD players.  But the one in Act III could have been more judiciously placed.<br />The big question is LASER DISC versus DVD. Comparing the two with an S-video connection activated (I don't have component video) the DVD version is sharper (you can clearly see the notes on the music sheets in the orchestra) and MOST IMPORTANT, free of video noise - little white and colored dots that show up in particularly dark scenes. Sonically the DOLBY DIGITAL is not that noticable a difference over the LASER sound - if it were it would probably create too obtrusive a bass response.  If you own the LASER you probably spent $60 for it several years ago and are wondering if the DVD is worth it.  If you want a artifact-free picture, it definitely is.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Buy the cd for The Look of Love  and Case of You, and let the rest come to you. Wonderfully recorded live album, Krall's sultry voice really is compelling and almost, dare I say, Ella-like at times, without the freneticism? Overall a great recording.
B000002J1B|5.0|Intense, harsh, ethereal, voluminous and ruggedly symphonic, Yes' _Relayer_ is arguably their most dark, experimental, grandiose and aggressive. _Close To The Edge_ was positive, peaceful and reflective. _Tales From Topographic Oceans_ was spiritually (and/or religiously) deep. However, on _Relayer_, Yes gets bleak, harsh and ominous--attributes that are rare in the positive, hopeful, celestial and peaceful world of Yes.<br />The 22-minute war tale known as \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\", is a gargantuan slice of mystical progressive rock. In atmosphere, this epic features screaming synths, manic guitar solos and overall explosive volatility. Steve Howe's claustrophobic, finger-itching and hasty-paced guitar solos qualify him as nothing less than a virtuoso. Jon Anderson's vocals are ethereal, heartfelt and moving. Later, Steve Howe and Chris Squire (bass) play something of an ionian scale before the violent, stormy and powerful instrumental middle section takes off. This is followed by the achingly beautiful \\"Soon, oh soon\\" section. The sad and poignant synthesizer backdrops provided by Patrick Moraz, set the stage for Jon Anderson's most poignant, ethereal and shiver-sending performance. His very last sung line (The sun will lead us, our reason to be here) makes my soul cry. After that, the epic sadly fades into oblivion.<br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" is a manic, frenzied and aggressive jazz-fusion number, which features enough technical mastery to give classic King Crimson a run for their money. Alan White's drumming is ultra-technical and violent. He plays as if there were no tomorrow. Steve Howe's guitar parts are fluid and virtuosic. The middle section features an extended guitar solo. Steve also seems to slip a portion of \\"Mood For A Day\\" (off of _Fragile_) on here as well. Chris Squire's snaky basslines sandwiched in the crazed mix are something to behold as well.<br />\\"To Be Over\\" is the mellow closer of the album. It features country-esque soundscapes (courtesy of Steve Howe's pedal steel), an instrumental section featuring many eerie sounds seeping from Patrick Moraz's keyboards, and a finale of chant-like vocal harmonies.<br />_Relayer_ is Yes hitting on all cylinders: Violence, intensity, aggression, gloom, despair, ethereality, love, hope (and maybe triumph). The complexity here may take some getting used to. But, in the end, _Relayer_ is a trip worth taking.owe's pedal steel), an instrumental section featuring many eerie sounds seeping from Patrick Moraz's keyboards, and a finale of chant-like vocal harmonies.<br />_Relayer_ is Yes hitting on all cylinders: Violence, intensity, aggression, gloom, despair, ethereality, love, hope (and maybe triumph).

B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go, the debut album of Canadian born Avril Lavigne is a must for any mixed up teenager with a passion for the girl power rock that is currently taking over the charts with artists such as Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton and Pink inspiring teenage girls throughout the States and now the UK.  This glorious first offering from Miss Lavigne is a superb mixture of pop, rock and ska which is sure to stun critics and entice music fans to their nearest record store within days of release.  Her first single which has already stormed the charts in the UK is aptly named Complicated, and is an easy to listen to delight with an unbelievably catchy melody and lyrics that fans are sure to love singing along to at Avril's inevitably packed forthcoming gigs.  She brings a realness to music that far outshines her seniors like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and at only 17 years old her lyrics hold an honesty and freedom that artists twice her years have not yet mastered.  The album demonstrates not only her diversity in style but also her unmistakable vocal skills and instrumental talent.  She has been compared to fellow Canadian Alanis Morrisette, no doubt due to her `take me as I am' attitude and excellent song writing abilities.  Every song on the Let Go album is written by Avril, showing a maturity and aptitude that stretches far beyond her years.  Songs that really stand out in intelligence of writing and vocal flair on the debut include the fuming Losing Grip with a haunting melody that truly shows `hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,' along with the equally impressive Too Much To Ask, Tomorrow and I'm With You.  The second single taken from the album, Sk8r Boi (Skater Boy) is a ska punk masterpiece with undeniably catchy, fun lyrics which should establish the up and coming star as a true talent of her generation.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I discovered this artist while browsing Blue Note's website, and what a pleasure it has been.  When I heard her sing the first verses I knew I had found something special. Her voice is touching, smooth, playful, and elegant. Listening to her is like finding that perfect glass of wine, a comfortable place to sit, accompained by a blue evening.  Allow yourself to be seduced by this incredible artist.
6305358567|5.0|When I watched this film, I was reminded of a line from the comedian Eric Morcombe when criticised about his piano playing; 'These are all the right notes, but not necessarily in the right order.' As far as I can tell, this film has got all its historical facts right, but not necessarily in the right order. However, as a piece of historical drama, this is pretty good stuff. The Tudor dynasty was a violent period, and the opening shot of heretics being burnt at the stake captures that period perfectly. Murder, intrigue, torture, and espionage are the currency of power and no one is safe, not even a Queen. The sheer horriblness of this period is what makes it so fascinating, and Shekhar Kapur doesn't let us down. The drama is so taut and well paced that I am gripped by this film each time I see it. The acting is spot on. Does Dickie Attenborough ever put on a bad performance? However, Cate Blanchett is a revelation. I had never seen her before this film, but was held entranced by her. A wonderful performance by a fine actress whom I am sure will go on to have a great career. My only criticism would be that she is maybe a little too beautiful to play good Queen Bess. Elizabeth is one of my favourite historical films. It doesn't hero-worship Elizabeth, but it does show her resourcefulness and inner strengths and why she is such an important historical figure.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Excellent album. A fullstop to the seventies work that consolidated Glam-Rock and also completes the Berlin period. The man himself says (alas not personally to me)that anytime he releases a new album it is compared to this. &quot;Fashion&quot; is harsh and catchy but not as harsh as &quot;It's No Game #1&quot;. Everything that one might love about Bowie is on this. &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; is an exorcism of the past and the likes of &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; look forward to... um... the 90's when he was worthwhile again. This is still timeless. Too much is going on to date it. Always more than a magpie of other styles, Bowie leaves a template for other, lesser, bands to build into the 80's. Some of it worked and some of it didn't. His new stuff is compared to this because there was such a big gap before he did anything as good again.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|I was eight years old when Beauty and the Beast first came out, and I must say, I prefer the old video version to this new DVD. I watched the DVD the other night while I was babysitting. There's a song in it called \\"Human Again\\" that wasn't in the first release. I could see why they cut it. Except for the kind of touching little scene with Belle and the Beast reading, that corny song was unnecessary. Also, I dunno if this was due to the TV or not, but the colors seemed too rich, too bright (i tried adjusting the TV, but the colors still didn't look right). I remember the colors being much softer, not so intense. The DVD version of the movie looked too much like a TV cartoon rather than feature film animation. I did like the sound, though. Unless you're a huge fan of the movie and want to see the extras included in the DVD, I suggest searching for the old release of the video (that is in good condition) in a used video store.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I have to admit, I thought \\"Genie In A Bottle\\", \\"What A Girl Wants\\", \\"Come On Over Baby\\" etc. were the dumbest songs ever..., I thought Christina was projecting a really bad image..., and I thought her career was really going downhill. Yes, I was a Christina hater! Well, not any more. After hearing so many good things about this album, I decided to swallow my pride and buy it. All I have to say is that I totally underestimated Christina Aquilera. Not only did she write and produce on this, but her singing is fantastic. The songs are great...very soulful and kind of dark at times, and also a lot of beautiful instrumentation. Overall, she came back with a kick-butt grown-up album. Here's how I rate the tracks:<BR>Can't Hold Us Down 8/10<BR>Walk Away 9/10<BR>Fighter 8/10<BR>Infatuation 7/10<BR>Loving Me For Me 8/10<BR>Impossible 9/10<BR>Underappreciated 8/10<BR>Beautiful 10/10 (BEST song on the album, in my opinion)<br />Make Over 9/10 <BR>Cruz 9/10 <BR>Soar 8/10<BR>Get Mine Get Yours 9/10<BR>Dirrty 9/10<BR>The Voice Within 10/10<BR>I'm OK 10/10 (wow)<BR>Keep On Singing My Song 9/10<BR>In this album Christina combines r+b, rock, pop, and latin music styles. So if you're a Christina hater and reading this, put aside all your thoughts on her and listen to the music with an open mind. It's GOOD.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Good movie, good plot.Especially the truck hijacking scenes were superb.And there are Paul Walker and Vin Diesel with some 900 hp speed machines in it.If you're a car fan you'll love it,if you're not you'^re still gonna like it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I still think Superman 1 & 2 with Christopher Reeves tops the charts as one of the best superhero movies. After all, who doesn't want to fly? But Spider-man takes a more down to earth hero from the comics successfully unto the big screen. Sam Raimi did a great job in bringing out the character as he's supposed to be unlike those tragedic Batman movies. They did take some liberties in Spiderman's origin and powers but it was still told quite nicely and, in some cases, like his organic webbing was a better change. I didn't think I would have liked this movie after having seen X-men. X-men was an ok movie but the mutant thing has been done to death. Didn't like their costume change either. Now, Spiderman shows that if you just portray the character seriously enough, you can still use those colorful comic costumes on screen and still be believable.<BR>  I think Tobey McGuire did an excellent job as Peter Parker. You really felt his anger at his Uncle's untimely demise. You really felt like swinging with him as he learned on the fly how to websling from rooftop to rooftop. And Kirsten Dunst, another character who I didn't think I'd believe in, portrayed a great Mary Jane Watson. Didn't even think her red hair annoyed me in the entire movie unlike Storm's godawful fake hair in X-men.<BR>  The dvd widerscreen is definitely the way to go. The black bars on the top and bottom aren't as big as other widescreen movies so you still have great picture even at a 27\\" TV. Lots of extras on the two disc set. Great animated menus although the interface is kinda weird with their shortcuts selection method. Takes awhile to figure out what does what. The movie itself is a great transfer. Clear picture and sound. Didn't see any artifacting or heard of people with faulty discs as of yet. Definitely a great movie at a great price. Kid's will love it. Adults will, too.
B00003CXXS|5.0|This is a really hillarious movie.The combination of animatronics and CGI made the those dinosaurs like real and surround sound was terrificly mixed.DVD features were also adequate and gives the viewer and indepth view of how they actually done it.But the movie was a little bit shorter than you expect-a mere 81 min-.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Basically, you'll either love this one or hate it.  It's amazingly simple, and it has no hidden meaning.  Its precisely what it says it is:  a movie about an ex-CIA spy who steals $9.5 billion from the government to fight terrorists.  This isn't your standard action-thriller.  Rather, its a mix of techno-thriller, action, and sex.  Shortly after the beginning of the movie, the hero-hacker is forced to crack a difficult code while getting a blow-job, with a gun to his head, as a test of his abilities.  Like I said, you'll either love it or hate it.<br />It has enough interesting plot twists to separate it from typical action movies; but yet, its not complicated.  You won't have to think for this movie.<br />I will admit, I was very skeptical at first.  I mean, John Travolta with a little thin-beard underneath his lips?  That already seemed stupid.  But I think you'll find it to be a good movie if you give it a chance.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I personally love this album.<br />The Strokes have this sorta Velvet Underground sound and bring in this whole retro kinda feeling.<br />Singer and bands`s songwriter, Julian Casablancas (son of John Casablancas, founder of Elite Modelling Agency) belts out the lyrics to their awesome songs with his amazing voice. While Nick Valensi, lead guitar gets right to the point of his raw and sharp solos. While other guitarist Albert Hammond jr. (son of Albert Hammond) brings in two solos for two different songs, one being in the very popular song Last Night. As drummer Fabrizo Moretti is in deep concentration while pounding away on his drum set. And as for bassist, Nikolai Fraiture is giving us a light and semi-soft, yet wonderfully bringing in the powerful deep sound of his bass.<BR>And in the end all their New Yorker sound(all of them except Albert and Fabrizo were born in New York. Fab born in Brazil and Albert born in Los Angeles. But they all grew up in NYC.) is put together and they are The Strokes.
B00006LSCX|4.0|When it comes to remixes, Kylie is quickly emerging as Madonna's fiercest competitor and the remixes included on this re-release no doubt, prove it.  If you haven't yet heard these, this is a great purchase for you because many argue that some of these are actually better than the orginals.  Kylie's bootleg combo of New Order's classic \\"Blue Monday\\" and her own smash \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" stole the show at last year's Brit Awards and left fans in awe for a long time afterwards begging for a release of the song.  The US Ruff & Jam remix of \\"Love At First Sight\\"  is another can't miss, especially if the song caught your ear during the summer.  Besides the remixes from Tim Deluxe and Scumfrog, the highlight here, in my opinion, is the Fischerspooner remix of \\"Come Into My World,\\" which is sure to cause a stir quite soon.  Giving the somewhat weak track a completely new \\"electro feel\\" the song takes on a whole new meaning of cool and proves that Kylie has pure potential for further world domination.  If you're just being introduced to Kylie and love dance music, this is a great start for you because this is, no doubt, a collection of her best work to date.  If any of her albums go down in history as classics, this is the one that will definately hit the spot.
0783225881|5.0|This is worth buying on video or dvd, along with Bull Durham. And I also reccomend this to anybody under 17 that can't watch Kevin Costner's Bull Durham out the year before this. This should be under the great buy part (I didn't to see what was under great buy) Though I have warn that this movie was rated PG for language. And if you are a baseball fan, then this should be in your family's collection. And if you do have this movie but only on video, why don't you up grade to dvd?<br />Or are you to cheap to do that? But of course you might not have a dvd player yet, if not buy one, and must this your first dvd purhase. As the movie opens, Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) hears a voice and calls to his wife Annie (Amy Madigan). But she or thier daughter Karen (Gaby Hoffman) heard the voice that tells Ray \\"If you build it, he will come\\". So when Ray figures out that if he would built a baseball field in his corn, that Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta) would come back and play baseball. Ray does, but once that starts losing thier savings, and now are on hte force to lose the house and the land. But what's wrose is that Ray, and his wife and daughter can see hte baseball players but his brother-in-law Mark (Timothy Busfield) does not, and believs that his brother-in-law and his family stare at an empty baseball field.
B00005RFAI|3.0|I bought this thinking that it was a compltely solid piece of work, and to my surprise it really isn't.  Yes, a lot of the songs here &quot;Family Portrait,&quot; &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; and the awesome &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me,&quot; are some of the best pop songs released in the past few years, but the whole album doesn't do it for me, especially R-E-S-P-E-C-T, which sounds ironic coming from a girl that doesn't have respect for pretty much anything.  This album will go down as a classic and a groundbreaking album for Pink, who, because of it, is now a well established artist, but nevertheless, it's not a guy's album.  Just look at the name of the artist, for starters!  The best cuts here are really the singles.
B00005JKZT|5.0|Right now, I'm in the middle of reading \\"The Two Towers\\" book, and I have also seen the trailer for the film version a few times. And I am anxiously awaiting this film's release. As we all know from \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the Fellowship has been broken, and they all went their separate ways. Also at the end of \\"The Fellowship\\" (which is actually in the first chapter of \\"The Two Towers\\"), Boromir dies in battle, and Gandalf has supposibly perished at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. But in this second part of the story, Merry and Pippin are captured by the Orcs and Strider, Gimli, and Legolas have gone off after them, while Frodo and Sam begin their journey to Mount Doom.<br />The first part of the BOOK, basically describes Merry and Pippin's escape from the Orcs and Strider, Gimli, and Legolas's hunt for them. We don't really learn what has happened to Frodo and Sam until the second half of the book. And I don't know how they will divide up the story for the film. But while Frodo and Sam are on their journey, they are encountered by Gollum, and surprisingly enough, Frodo asks Gollum to be their guide through Mordor.<br />There are going to be new characters in this film, too, as well as much of the original characters from \\"The Fellowship\\". More battle scenes, better visual/sound effects, and a more complex storyline/plot. This second film will also be more dark, and many unexpected things may occur. As director Peter Jackson said on \\"The Fellowship's\\" DVD, if you thought \\"The Fellowship\\" was visually stunning, just wait til you see \\"The Two Towers\\"!<br />*NO SCORES AVAILABLE YET*
B00006CXXU|5.0|It's so difficult to be objective when reviewing an artist youre a fan of.  I have always been a fan of Christina Aguilera but she has really impressed me this time.  For all of those whom thought of her as a Britney nemisis, this is clearly going to distinguish the two.  Her 5th (yes there's 5) album has a lot of edge and personal lyrics to it and theres also a couple of songs about staying hopeful and rising above on it.  Most notable the hot ballad walk away which i have listned to 6 times today.  Also Beautiful ,I'm O.K., Cant Hold us Down, Dirrty, Keep on Singing my Song and Impossible go on to make this her strongest most edgy album yet my final answer: Christina is all grown up and buy this album . . . you will enjoy it.
0792843584|3.0|It is difficult to watch Heaven's Gate without being fully aware of the film's history.  It was the film that brought down a studio; it is the worst film ever made; it was a film made by an egomaniac director completely out of control; it is a complete and incoherent mess.  And, as with many film legends, many of these claims are made by people who have never seen it. So, whenever one sits down to watch this 3 hour 40 minute epic, you cannot help but view the film through these prisms.<br />The current version of the film available on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD claims to be Cimino's original cut of the film, though that is hard to prove given that the 3+ hour version was never officially released.  Studio heads panicked and yanked that version several days before the opening, demanding Cimino recut it to a shorter length. Apparently, this version available on video was \\"found\\" by the studio and released because of the enormous curiosity and history of the production.  There has been no formal declaration that this version IS the final cut that Cimino had planned to release.<br />Is the film as bad as everyone says?  The film that is available on video does has its problems.  The audio mix is atrocious with much of the dialogue being lost in the mix of ambient sound.  The opening sequence, though well executed, is totally unnecessary.  The pacing of the first 40 minutes is slow, confusing, and a mishmash of scenes that the viewer is left to figure out its importance and meaning. The lead actor and the film's anchor, Kris Kristoferson, turns in a boring, leaden, one-note performance that further hampers the film.<br />But the film also has much going for it.  The cinematography, always singled out as a highlight, is truly astonishing. Combined with the meticulous and accurate production work of the sets and costumes, the film has the unmistakable look and feel of being shot in the late 1890's. It has a compelling storyline that deals with the issue of immigration in a fresh and controversial way.  The performances of the actors, in particular Hubert and Waterston, are excellent and go a long way in compensating for several weakly scripted scenes.  And the music of David Mansfield is note-perfect.  So when these elements are combined--as they are many times throughout--the film is very impressive, engaging, and shows enormous promise.<br />Where the film truly suffers is in the editing.  I saw the original 2 1/2 version several times during its release, though it was not much better overall (it felt too short!), the storyline was clearer and there were a couple of expository moments that this version lacks.  One could easily trim down the first hour to an improved, clearer, and better paced 30 minutes. It is the lack of structure that really injures this version. One almost gets the sense that the film is still in its rough-cut stage and is about 2 - 3 versions away from a finished product.<br />The DVD release is a huge disappointment.  The master is taken from the laserdisc version and suffers an enormous loss of clarity.  Because of this, viewers are only given a letterboxed version and not the preferred 16x9 presentation that this widescreen presentation deserves.  The audio, though stating it is 5.1, is bland and muddled and demonstrates no delineation between front and rear.  What is even more frustrating is that many of the Polish scenes lack proper subtitles, so the viewer has no idea what is being spoken.  (There is no English subtitle track either.)<br />It is difficult to recommend this film to family or friends as you will never know what will be the reaction.  If you are patient and understand that this is not a final version, then you are more forgiving of its faults and can enjoy many of its excellent moments.  On the other hand, if you are expecting to see the Worst Film Ever Made, you have much that will prove that theory.

B00006CXXU|4.0|When Christina Aguilera first dropped onto into the musical world, her first single \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" blew up out of nowhere.  Being one of those artists that used TRL as a stepping stone while the show was brand new benefited her.  Her self-titled debut album debut at #1 on the Billboard charts and sold over 215,000 units the first week, and over 10 million units total.  The album boasted 4 top 10 singles, and helped her to receive the Best New Artist award at the Grammy awards over the heavily favored Britney Spears.  Since her debut dropped, she has slipped into an unexplained 4 year silence, only to be broken with one of the most introspective albums in recent memory.  This album is near flawless, and is incredible in every sense of the word.<br />The album's first single \\"Dirrty\\" was an excellent way to return to her celebrity status.  With Def Jam rapper Redman spitting on the track it was destined to become a hit.  The single's sizzling video reveals a lot of Christina, but not as much as this album does.  She wrote nearly every song on the album, and she discusses nearly every topic that fans are dying to know about.  From her perception of how guys and girls stereotypes affect her on the Lil Kim collaborated \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", to the relationship gone wrong ballads \\"Walk Away\\" & \\"Cruz\\", to the fatherless child track \\"I'm OK\\" fans get a more in depth look into the life this beauty queen lives, and its much deeper then they ever expected.<br />With the exception of a few clunkers (\\"Make Over\\", \\"Underappreciated\\", \\"Soar\\", \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" & the interludes ) the album is breath taking.  I myself never knew that Christina was capable of anything like this neither lyrically nor vocally.  Her musical influences show up hear throughout the album, like on the neo-soul inspired \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", the alternative \\"Fighter\\", and the sizzling Latino ballad \\"Infatuation\\".  The album's biggest standouts though, are the female self-esteem track \\"Beautiful\\", and the Alicia Keys penned \\"Impossible\\", which also features Keys on piano.<br />This shouldn't be slept on.  Christina made my jaw drop from the very first listen.  This is going to take her out of that teen-pop world and place her in a category all her own.  I'm honestly surprised, but I'm also very excited because I know that she will only get better with time.  The Britney comparisons will definitely be put to rest once this record hits stores.  Christina is a true talent, her lyrics are inspiring and her voice is very powerful.  Make sure you scoop this one up.e Alicia Keys penned \\"Impossible\\", which also features Keys on piano.<br />This shouldn't be slept on.  Christina made my jaw drop from the very first listen.

B00000099Y|1.0|It's always hilarious when someone tries to write something intelligent-sounding as a review title, then horribly misspells one of the words, instantly revealing themselves as total idiots.<br />The biggest problem with Tool must be the fans. They see the misconceptions surrounding Tool's \\"intelligence\\" as an artificial means of boasting their self-esteem while sitting back to enjoy another cold beer and ponder just what is going on in the music. This must be true, because I can't fathom how anyone with any true concentration can say the things they do about the band and still come off as halfwits in the review. (I apologize to all the non alcoholics reading this. Clean up your act.)<br />Anyway, some fans have managed to hype up this terminally average band to near-Zeppelin sized status through misplaced words. As if Tool's accomplished anything that half-a-dozen other bands haven't done better, especially with this album. Even Undertow is a better rock record than this is, and Lateralus a better prog record. And neither will be remembered in a couple of years.<br />Tool is one of the better bands out there, actually. The question is, \\"better than what?\\" Sure, this group is more engaging than Blink-182 (whoever reccommended Enema of the State at the top of the page is a funny bastard), or any number of boy bands. But I've heard 25+ albums this year that surpass Tool's entire ouevre. Some of these are plenty mediocre. Too.<br />Anyway, the reason that stupid people are stupid is because they think they aren't just because they have backup from other stupid people. Smart people know they don't know everything, and they don't pretend. <br />Anybody who gets some of the veiled jokes in the above slag of words, please say so.<br />See my eventual Top CDs of 2002 list for some of these discs mentioned above.
6305897786|5.0|This is a  more-or-less faithful cinematic version of &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; by Arturo Perez-Reverte, an astonishingly clever novel. Johnny Depp is pitch perfect as Dean Corso, an astute antiquarian book dealer. The supporting performances are fine as well. What we loved most though...what has drawn us to this film for a number of viewings...is the fabulously creepy and decadent atmosphere and the insider's view of the rare books market. The end is a bit over-the-top, but we forgave that because of the many rewards of the rich characterizations, the splendid book scenes, and the creepy, convoluted story with its many puzzles and surprises.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is my favorite Disney film and I'm so pleased to own it on dvd. Made during Disney's \\"rebirth\\" in the late 80's and early nineties, this film was released to both critical and popular acclaim. After receiving 6 Oscar nominations and winning for best song, the film continued to be a favorite among many. Last year, Disney re-released the film on IMAX, a visual treat and now they are giving us three editions in this edition! This dvd is filled with lots of goodies, including games, commentaries, videos as well as the special edition shown in IMAX, the original edition and the \\"work in progress\\" that was shown at the New York film festival before the premiere of the film. The story of Belle, a young woman who dreams of adventure in her life is beautifully animated and filled with great songs that stay with you long after you've seen the film. All the characters are lots of fun and the film pretty well embodies all you could ask in a film---romance, adventure, musical numbers, and a good villain! This is a guaranteed good time for little ones and those of us adults who love a great animated film. A great gift for a friend, a little one, or yourself! This is a great two dvd set. You'll love it!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I really hope that people get a chance to listen to Christina's whole CD. It is nothing at all like \\"Dirrty\\". There's only one other song that is as sexual as that one. The rest of the songs are beautiful, soulful, and you can tell they come from her heart. She sings with such passion on this record, especially on my favorite song \\"Walk Away.\\" The first time I heard it I started to cry b/c it was so emotional, and you could tell Christina was singing it from her heart. Some of the songs on this CD sound like something Alicia Keys would sing. It is that good, and I hope that Christina gets the recognition she deserves for her amazing voice and ability. Hopefully this CD will get nominated for a Grammy. It deserves to.
0345409671|5.0|This book is undoubtably her best work. Anne Rice takes Chrisitanity and rips it up by the roots to remake it in her own image. Im sure at first this is hard for some Christians to stomach. In my mind this is a perfect explaination of who and why we are. For me this is the only thing that would give Chrstianity any real basis and proof. It is a must read for anyone. I dont thing this deserves to be bashed like it is for it is  a amazing book.
0385334206|5.0|In the novel, Breakfast of Champions, by Kurt Vonnegut, the author uses rising action to effectively tell the story of a brief, yet meaningful meeting between Kilgore Trout and Dwayne Hoover. Dwayne Hoover, increasingly affected by `bad chemicals', builds up to an explosion of madness. Knowing from the beginning that Dwayne is doomed to insanity amplifies the tension and holds the reader in suspense, waiting for the inevitable to happen. While the book uses rising action, it isn't in the sense of an action movie, but instead uses descriptions of a series of upcoming events that lead to the fateful meeting of Hoover and Trout. The book is strengthened by the way Vonnegut builds up to the climax. <BR> To Vonnegut, `what' is less important than `why'. In first two-thirds of the book, he uses the rising action technique to relate why the events happen. He not only describes why they happen, but he expresses his opinions on the reasons why. In doing this, he slips in a mocking comment or two in order to keep the reader engaged. The book is enjoyable because he spends the first half discussing what's to come and why it's going to happen, all with a sardonic twist. He conveys many cynical views, and relates them to the characters. He even puts himself in the story, showing the power of the author as the creator of the universe within the novel. The way he describes the actions before they happen, and clarifies why they happen, makes the novel much more interesting.<BR> However, some readers may see a downside to Vonnegut's work. While he does utilize an interesting way to tell the story, and to express his sarcastic observations, the lack of action may be viewed as somewhat boring. Readers interested in more dynamic suspense filled books may have trouble holding out until the end. He could appear to go on and on about the same topics, offering different view points on them, and it dragging out the novel. For readers accustomed to action adventures, the rising action may not seem to rise much, if at all.<BR> Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions is overall an excellent book. Because of his use of rising action to convey his interesting perspectives on life, he is able to draw readers into to wanting to find out what happens to the characters. His sharp wit and mocking attitude can bring many laughs, accompanied by harsh truths. Breakfast of Champions easily warrants four and one-half stars, for it's excellence as a novel, as well as the satirical truths that are shown about the world.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Some films are impossible to categorize. Donnie Darko can be seen as horror, science fiction, drama or social satire but in truth it is just art. This is the sort of entertainment that is best experienced in a relaxed state of half dreaming. The plot defies analysis and the bizarre situations that arise are strangely suited to the audience's mood. After my first viewing, I didn't know what I had seen but I knew I liked it. In fact, it took several sessions to reach a solid hypothesis as to the narrative cause and effect.<br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character, a troubling but not troubled young man who lives in a different world to the rest of us. His average family offers him all the support they can but even Donnie's psychiatrist struggles to understand his situation. The prescription of antischizophrenic drugs seems to do little to blunt his visions, nor do they stop his nocturnal missions. I particularly like the way the soundtrack was gently used to separate the normal from the abnormal. The film's mournful version of \\"Mad World\\", (originally made famous by Tears for Fears), was one of the musical highlights.<br />One of Donnie's most interesting qualities is that he has no fear of the common-place terrors that exist for the rest of us. He tells his teachers where to shove it, asks the beautiful Gretchen to go steady after only a day, speaks out against the school's guest brain-washer and even copes calmly with murderous bullies. He is however, afraid that the world will end in 28 days and is concerned about dying alone, but then who isn't.<br />The story is interwoven with several mysteries, only some of which are even partially explained in the film. One of the most important of these occurs while Donnie is out one night on the local golf-course, talking to a six foot rabbit named Frank. I don't know if this is an allusion to the James Stewart film, \\"Harvey,\\" but it is certainly not played for laughs, as Frank is quite sinister. Sometime during this meeting Donnie's bedroom is demolished by a falling jet engine. No one knows where it came from and no airline claims their lost property, but one thing is certain, if Donnie hadn't been AWOL, he'd be very dead.<br />Life quickly resumes. The family's notoriety fades and school life once again regains its position of central torment in Donnie's life. His beautiful and sensitive English teacher, along with his grounded and caring science teacher, (Barrymore & Wylie), fail to offset the damage done by the stressed and misguided gym teacher, Kitty Farmer. She is a disciple of Jim Cunningham, (Swayze), a motivational speaker who reaks of charm and paternalistic love; so much so that Donnie, and the audience, just can't buy into his simple solutions.<br />The film's cast is huge but of an impressive quality, for an ostensibly independent production. All the major characters seemed to go beyond what is expected and create three dimensional beings with quirks, fears and emotions that are subtly alluded to. I particularly enjoyed Gyllenhaal's performance as Donnie. When he is in the sway of one of his visions, the cast of his eye is more disturbing than any million dollar special effect. Beth Grant, playing the Gym teacher, is also outstanding. Her new-age zealotry is the perfect representation of what is truly dangerous in our politically correct society.<br />Along with a great cast, the script is amazing. Not just in its creativity but that it ever managed to get funding. Chock full of unlikely theories, small but convoluted set pieces and thought provoking dialogue, it made the film entertaining, even after several viewings. Small touches bring Donnie's world home to us; like the discussion of the sexual mores of Smurfs, Ms Pomeroy forcing the new girl to sit next to the guy she likes best and an old lady suffering a life-threatening obsession with checking her perpetually empty mailbox.<br />In the end though, it is the greater plot devices that twist our minds like some drug induced mobius loop. Is Donnie some sort of psychotic super-hero? Did everyone remember an alternative future, at the end? Were Grandma Death's theories on time-travel true? If you like pat answers in your entertainment, then you'll be frustrated with Donnie Darko. If however, like me, you like to solve puzzles, you may be prepared to dive into the depths of Donnie's world. Come on in; the water's dark.e drug induced mobius loop.

6305531374|3.0|Only on the 2nd time around seeing this one did I notice JLC's line to her boyfriend (?) that Michael killed some of her friends 20 yrs ago.  Not a mention of the events of sequels 4,5,6.  This was dissapointing to  me because it's like 4,5 and 6 didn't happen.  My beef here isn't that those were good or bad sequels (reading here clearly indicates alot of people dissatisfied with 4,5,6)  but that the events were not even worth noting.  Conceded.....the real Halloween storyline is LAURIE vs. MICHAEL MYERS however.....in 4,5 and 6 who was the &quot;boogeyman&quot;?  It was Michael Myers.   In 4,5 and 6 where did it take place?  It was HADDONFIELD (not Santa Mira!).  What is one &quot;small thing&quot; that 1,2,4,5,6 have in common?  DONALD PLEASANCE!--no reference to him in H20 was there?  Remember in JAWS 2 they mentioned Matt Hooper (r. dryefuss)when the new Shark appeared in Amity?.....(Pleasance was as much the spirit (if not more) of those films as JLC was in the first 2 - funny we get a PSYCHO references but none of him).  Jamie Lloyd was who?  Oh my gosh...Laurie Strode's daughter...and was not mentioned.   I thought the Thorn cult idea was eerie and mysterious and could have been persued in any sequel after H6.  If the ideas behind the film were to distance itself from 4,5,6 because of negative feedback on those films at least they could have threaded the storyline from those along into H20 if at least in reference. I didn't dislike the film totally because   I am and remain a fan of the series but gaffs like that are hard to ignore.  And this is but one man's opinion.
B000002IV8|1.0|I love Overkill, but my dissapointment is imeasurable. This album has the guitars, the vocals and beats that made Overkill famous, yet it lacks the heart of good music. Simply put, it [reaks]. In hindsight, I should have known by the really cool cover art. In the metal word,saddly, the better your album cover the worse the music. This is a prime example. Buy this album if you need a nice silver sided coaster for your drinks. But do not let this this disc anywhere near your CD player!
B00004SYWZ|2.0|Their Debut and 2nd album (my favorite A-ha album) are simply haunting masterpieces of 80s. 2nd Album sports more matured sound and depth. Debut album is also full of catchy songs. Once I played their music on my car-stereo and my 6yr old son suddenly shouted &quot;I like that song!&quot;. It was 'Take on me'. Why not?  Since I was totally satisfied with their earlier albums, I tried their 3rd 'stay on these roads'. Well. it was total disappointment.  I have no idea what they had in their minds...   Living daylight was OK but there was no other song I would remember. <br />Then I saw this album, minor earth  major sky, their new millennium effort. Maybe they should name it 'Major sky minor earth'. It wasn't impressive, it wasn't enjoyable. Just ... it sounds like one song of 58min.30sec running time.  All same mood and very little variety of tempo. More guitar stuff but not memorable. Only thing drew my attention was the sound of Mellotron (Sampled or real).  A couple of songs were OK but 58min? Album cover art is beautiful but I strongly recommend ; Start with their 2nd and Debut album. And their later stuffs are different from these. <br />But I believe, if they want they can reproduce another album full of their hauntingly beautiful songs. I will be waiting.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. One of it's finest qualites is the fact that it can be enjoyed by everyone in the family, regardless of their ages. It's an instant classic and a must have.
0448060191|5.0|I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal  etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.<br />As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow.  Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition. <br />Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite  reliable as a portrait of that society.<br />This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women.
B000003S09|5.0|The remastering has brought out the best of this album's qualities. If you don't own/have/buy this album then you're probably not a fan of rock and certainly not of progressive rock.It's brilliant.
B00001PE4D|4.0|This movie wsa surprisingly entertaining despite what I origionally assumed it would be.  At first look it seemed like a boo hoo sob sob date movie, yet it was amazingly entertaining.  The hot young cast (cliche) pulled off this one well, despite corny idea and sleezy idea.  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillp play a set of step sibings who life revolves around sex, drugs, and games.  Reece Witherspoon plays the virtuouse virgin who is the target of the game and the one who changes the game for what it origionally was.  The whole plot revolves around Ryan Phillips character trying to \\"get it on\\" with Reece Witherspoon.  If he does he gets to \\"Get it on\\" with Sarah Michelle Gellar.  However if he loses, he loses his prized car.  From there it mostly involves Ryan trying to seduce Reece, but ends up in love with her instead.<br />As was stated earlier the story itself is cheesey however because the acting is well done and the fact that it was surprisingly touching and is highly entertaining, a perfect date film for what it's worth.  However if you watch this alone than you may get bored, but overall it is one of the better films out there in the teen category.
