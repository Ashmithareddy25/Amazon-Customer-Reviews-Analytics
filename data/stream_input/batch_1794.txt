B0043EV774|5.0|Nice story plot. Good collection of blu ray movies! You can appreciate the nice graphics using this blu ray cd. Worth the money!
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it was very close to &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; I thought the story was real good in this one too. I enjoyed the second book as well and can't wait now for the third.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not choose to read this book for a long time because of the story line. Once I started reading it I could not stop. I can't wait to read the next one!
B006X50OPW|5.0|The interviews were everything I expecyed and more. Great questions, superb dialogue and perfect insight<br />into the minds of the best. Being a trader it also gave me some great do's and dont's when it comes to the<br />difficulties of the trader's mind. It is the type of book I will read more than once due to the numerous recommendations offered by the most successful.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This is my favorite novel, TV movie, play, AND big screen movie! Old fashioned chills and scares! SEE IT NOW!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I like this game because I like to pretend to be a doctor as my fob when I play house.
B002EXC5UY|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I'm so glad it's finally available for rental from Amazon. Video quality is fantastic. Well worth watching again and again.
B008B3F38C|5.0|I have both their previous albums, and I have to say that this album is at least as good as the previous albums. Possibly better.
0452295548|4.0|Interesting information. Gives a lot of detail that doctors don't always share with you. Made my expirences with having a stroke easier to understand.
B007918P1E|4.0|Could just be my personal taste, but I couldn't help but feel that it just wasn't the same as the old Epica music that I've grown a little fond of.<br /><br />  That being said however, it still makes for good listening.

B007EECSFA|4.0|A perfect book for a couple days of just reading.  I thought I had the secret figured out several times, but there was always another twist.  And I liked how it all made sense in the end, even if it was a little bit too neat and tidy of a wrap up.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Loved this film, all of the action scenes and a love story, I've already watched it 3 times.I would recommend you to see it, it will be a classic.
B008KE3960|4.0|Very solid game as you would probably expect coming direct from Amazon.<br /><br />Could perhaps do with a little more variety as I found once I had bought a few planes and opened most of the maps that there wasn't much else to keep me going.<br /><br />But on the whole a great game. Nice tweak on traditional tower defense. Hope they do a sequel.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Most of the female role models in film are either too raunchy or too feeble - Mirinda on the other hand seems almost perfect.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|This was one of the worst movies I saw in 2012. It was so painful, I had watch it at 1.5x speed.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|The book is well written and the characters are very engaging. I enjoyed the historical theme and always find pleasure in learning something when reading a work of fiction. This work of fiction takes place before, during, and after WWI. It gives the reader an undersatnding of what life was like in some of the countries during this period of time. I enjoyed this book and I would also suggest the sequel: Winter of the World.
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|You would think after ten years you might see something new? But no! It's the same effects same punch lines and same story. Will smith does a great job that's really the only positive thing about it
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|My family just watched this last night and it's truly the best Christmas/Holiday film I've seen in years. The dialogue is incredibly witty and smart, filled with lots of details that grown-ups will catch but still entertain children. I've seen so many cartoons and movies illustrating the Santa 2.0 industrial complex and the technological feats the North Pole executes to deliver gifts in a single night, but wow... the creative team built an amazing world. The motion graphics and the little details on the computer screens along with the 10,000+ elves is epic.<br /><br />Plus, the family interactions from Grandfather to Father and then the two sons is fantastic. Every Santa has their own history and the evolution of Christmas and the needs of the two brothers is incredibly compelling and adds to the narrative. I highly recommend this movie.
B004EPZ02A|1.0|Unfortunately they went really cheap with the effects and did what so many do take a good story and copy other movies as they can't come up with anythig better. The first was great,the second was ok this well it's b grade I would expect the fourth won't be any better

B0086700CM|5.0|I have played temple run for a little while now and I have to say that it is really fun and addictive. The power-ups provide better gaming experience, and the way coins are collected make the game more challenging.  I see no reason why anyone shouldn't download this app.

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Phillip was this past season winner of American Idol.  I became a fan during the aired &#34;auditioning&#34; process, and was SURE he would win.  His multi-Platinum hit &#34;Home&#34; was all over the radio, used in conjunction with the Womens Gymnatics competitions during the Olympics.  I purchased the mp3, and couldn't wait for his debut &#34;Album.&#34;  I'm not disappointed, every cut is great.  My favorite though is probably &#34;Gone, Gone, Gone.&#34;  There are 3 &#34;extra&#34; songs on this Deluxe Edition, one of which is a live version of &#34;Home&#34;.... outstanding.

B00A6I87UQ|3.0|UPDATE 07/30/2013:<br /><br />The release of Kindle 3.9 today finally (after over 7 months of waiting for this to be resolved) allows me to open the atlas on my 3rd Generation iPad.  As others have noted, the quality of the atlas on the iPad screen is pretty lousy. It looked good on my Android phone, but it loses a lot on the iPad's large retina screen. This atlas really needs to be done in a vector graphics pdf format with links setup to jump between atlas pages when clicking on the arrow page reference on the side of each atlas page.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have had the same issues others have reported with regard to getting the Kindle version to work on the iPad and Windows 7 Kindle apps. I was successful in getting it to download and open on my Android phone.<br /><br />Amazon technical support is making progress with this, but they first tried to blame it on my credit card order being in pending status for several hours.  However, once the credit card order went to completed status the problem did not clear up.<br /><br />Amazon booted up to higher level of technical support this evening. After getting it to work on my Android phone while they were on the line, their inability to download it on an iPhone while I was on the line and their records showing it should be available for iPad, they have booted the problem up further to their development staff. My suspicion is the recent release of this content is not working properly with the recent update of the iPad kindle app to version 3.5.  Amazon tech support is supposed to email me when they know more from the development staff.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Great graphics.<br />Great music.<br />A real gem of a find on the Amazon App of the Day deal.<br />That said, it's a great game for $1. You won't be disappointed.
0316187216|4.0|*Originally posted at BadassBookReviews.com!*<br /><br />This was my first Joe Abercrombie novel and I really enjoyed it. It was gritty, bloody, and violent. Suprisingly, it had a lot of heart underneath all the grime. I'm sure I would have appreciated some of the characters more if I had read the previous First Law World novels, but I never felt lost or like I was missing anything vital. I do know that I enjoyed this one so much that I will be picking up the other novel in Abercrombie's 'verse.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the character of Shy South. She was strong and hard-working, she didn't give up no matter the odds, and she didn't let anyone dictate her actions. Lamb, who I have come to understand was the focus of the original trilogy, was an interesting character. He was trying to find redemption but continued to find his past hard to escape. I really enjoyed the interaction between Shy and Lamb; they were probably some of my favorite scenes in the entire novel. Temple was also an intriguing character who played well off Shy. Their back and forths were very humorous. I was happy to see Temple was able to find a kind of salvation and become a better man in the end.<br /><br />The plot was a little meandering at first, but when Shy and Lamb joined up with the Fellowship and Temple washed up downriver, everything started moving very quickly. The story felt like Oregon Trail crossed with the Lord of the Rings and I totally dug it. I loved learning about all the side characters in the Fellowship and their motivations and aspirations. The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because of the beginning being a little slow and the ending being a little drawn out. Though I liked the way the story ended, it had several different points that felt like they could have been endings. Don't let that detract you though, this story is pure balls to the wall fun.<br /><br />This book is full of violence and gore but is mixed with a dry humor and unrepentent determination. If you like movies like True Grit or The Searchers, you would probably love this book. Even though I wouldn't call it a fanatasy novel per se, I would recommend it to all fantasy readers because of the epic feel. If you like an action-packed story with characters you can really get behind, give this novel a try!<br /><br />Thank you to Netgalley and Orbit Books for providing an ARC copy of this book!like movies like True Grit or The Searchers, you would probably love this book.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I usually read the book before I see the movie, but this time I did it in reverse. The first person voice and letter/journal format are just right for the subject matter, and it was nice to recall scenes from the movie as I read. Also, being left with the mystery of who Charlie's correspondent is made me want to go back and read it again right away (the way Charlie would). Excellent!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|This game is pretty fun but it will take FOREVER if you don't plan to buy gems or other things to give you an edge.  For example, they give you an island fill of trees and rocks that you have to remove in order to expand.  To get rid of a rock will cost you 10 grand which usually takes at least a day to accrue.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|My i5 3570k is running 3.7+ ghz with this cooler and has never broken 70 C under any kind of load. If you are even remotely mechanically inclined you will not have much difficulty installing this unit. Getting the screws through the backplate was the only tricky part, and that was simply because I didn't realize they had flats on them and had to be oriented a certain way.
B000654OUG|5.0|is this magical collection by the incandescent Uchida. Her playing brings out the beauty of Schubert's music. There is a combination of delicacy and urgency that makes of these compositions something truly divine. Just listen to the 18th sonata. I cry every time. I love this album so much, i have a hard time being intellectual about it. Not that there's much of a reason to be- I'm no musical expert, hardly a musician, just a humble messenger doing her best to spread her love for what I feel is truly beautiful and important. There is this feeling of life moving through me, of gratitude and awe when I listen to these pieces. Mitsuko is a truly special artist, one who brings out the pauses in movement, the sadness in the lilt and the lilt in the sadness that I feel is at the core of what makes Schubert...Schubert. Just buy this cd.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|I purchase this to convert a digital output from my new flat screen to the analog input from my older stereo. It seemed like a pretty straight forward device, but it did not work for me.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Spoiler Alert!  Don't read this unless you've seen the other two movies!<br /><br />I've liked the other MIB movies, and I like this one.  I think it will grow on me.  But if you remember the first one, Agent K is pining for the girl he left behind.  &#34;It's better to have loved and lost...&#34; Agent J. tells him.  &#34;Try it!!!&#34; K snaps back.  At the end of that movie, he's left MIB, is reunited with his long lost, and is shown with a beaming smile on his face.<br /><br />In MIB2, Agent K is back to being taciturn because his wife left him.  But he shows more emotion when he's reminded of another long, lost love.  Remember the goodbye scene as she goes back to Zartha?  (Yes, I warned of spoilers, but I won't go into detail.)<br /><br />In MIB3, Agent K isn't just taciturn, he's downright morose.  Agent J wonders why he's &#34;always&#34; been that way.  Say what?  Beaming smile never happened?  The warmth of that goodbye never happened either?<br /><br />And for anyone who watched the first MIB, remember how much fun it was when Agent K put in the Eight Track and we got to hear Elvis singing &#34;Promised Land&#34;?  Now it seems all Agent K ever wanted to listen to was &#34;cowboy music.&#34;  And, you guessed it, he has a totally different long lost love, right there at MIB.<br /><br />I don't know how many times Agent K has to be cured of his taciturn nature, but I'm hoping if there's a MIB4, they find something else to do.<br /><br />Other problems: Not enough aliens, too many plotholes, never use a cute alien to slap the shiznet out of another alien (we just feel sorry for the cute alien), no Jeebs, no Frank (I know a lot of people found him annoying, but I liked him in small doses), not enough worm guys, and if you've seen the trailers, you've basically seen all the cool parts of the movie.  Still, I think it's going to grow on me, even though I'd say it's the weakest MIB yet.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I received this item in perfect condition and ready to wrap for a Christmas Gift.  Thank you so much.  I was very impressed.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Wow - Robert Plant's age requires he sing at just a tad lower octive at times but the band sounds sharp.  Jason Bonham made his dad proud on this one.  I wore the CD's/DVD out and then shipped it to my son in Afghanistan.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I do believe in Alicia and her musical talent is beyond questioning. This CD however should not have been produced, I believe each new CD must outperfom the previous one.. and this one didn´t in my view

0316227706|5.0|The photography in this book is absolutely awesome. I have only one complaint and that is that one of the photographs that spreads across both pages has the dog right in the seam. Every other page layout is perfect. (Also, I just wanted to say that I saw that some people commented about the safety issues for bulldogs, etc. who don't do well underwater... you can tell in the photos those dogs are on a very shallow step.)
B00192IV9U|5.0|It's just about two years since MICHAEL was released. What do you say about this so highly anticipating release? The controversy about this album was expected but not like this ... I was getting goose-bums as I was reading some stuff written by MJ hard core fans. Also most \\"music business establishments\\" severely criticized this album. Q Magazine, which I read religiously and respect in terms of music critics, called this album \\"Fake Rolex - it's all there but nothing works\\".<br /><br />MICHAEL is packaged perfectly, from the MUSIC on it, to the cover. Over the last 5-6 years I have heard a few tracks that leaked on the internet that MJ was working on. I didn't like any of them. I expected those songs to be on this album. Thankfully people who put this album together went into different direction. I love the idea of these songs coming from different MJ eras over last 30 years. Over-all sound works so well and it doesn't feel like compilation. It feels like a solid album. At certain moments feels semi-nostalgic. If I had to pick my favorite songs here, I'd go with \\"Hold My Hand\\", \\"Monster\\" and \\"Much Too Soon\\". \\"Behind The Mask\\" feels like classic MJ moment and ultimate fan-favorite on this album. Also I remember that there was minimal promotion by record company for this release. It STILL sold really well. It was also criticized a lot. But personally I like this a lot better than greatest hits re-worked for IMMORTAL and BAD25 remixes ...<br /><br />I don't know where I am in terms of levels of being MJ fan. I definitely have always had MJ present in my life from his image in media to his MUSIC. He was part of important events throughout my whole life. I own complete music catalogue of his recordings on CD and DVD, I attended one of the international memorials for The King when he passed away ... But when it comes to MJ MUSIC, I was always fan of his later stuff rather than his early recordings. I think MICHAEL has timeless quality. I think that people of my generation (growing up in the 80-ies) will LOVE this album.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is a great plot and nice tie in to the first movie from this series. The villian is scary and the movie is action packed.
B007HACDLK|4.0|this was not as good as all the previous Mitch Rapp books by Vince Flynn.  Not as much action as in the past.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book, mainly because of the many twists and turns.  The way it was written was engaging, as we had the current day interspersed with flashbacks about his life prior to his 100th birthday.  However, it was a bit slow in parts especially when the author would rehash what had happened in the present day since escaping from the nursing home.  He led a very interesting life, and it reminded me a little of the movie Forrest Gump.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|The new hybrid of animation coupled with a great story is the best yet! I can't say enough good about this movie!
1592332803|1.0|How I wish I had read \\"a friend\\"s review before purchasing this book! I absolutely have the intellectual capacity to alter a recipe to the extent of using egg replacer instead of eggs and vegan \\"butter\\" instead of real butter. I didn't need to spend good money on a book that does it for me; I just as easily could have taken any of my 27 cake/cookie recipe books and done the conversions myself.<br /><br />Maybe I was expecting too much: Recipes that are not based on the assumption that animal based foods are the \\"real thing\\" and in order to be a compassionate cook/consumer one has to substitute animal-based ingredients with highly processed commercial products; but that vegan cooking and baking are worthwhile in their own right. Surely there are some nice looking recipes in the book. Surely I will take the time sometime to tinker with a few of them to add nature's real flavors, textures and nutrition. Or, for the office party, to keep them vegan without having to resort to vegan lookalikes (which are not stocked in my local supermarket). But that really isn't the point of buing a recipe book.<br /><br />Summary: If you are a junk food vegan and your admitted goal is to continue eating like everybody else but without hurting animals, this book is a must have. If, on the other hand, you are looking for exciting new options, maybe even healthier ones, keep looking.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I chose this novel because of the reviews in our local paper.  I found the beginning interesting, the middle was wordy and boring and the end was the best part

B005NJU8PA|5.0|If good writing is much meaning in few words, a.k.a \\"having something to say\\" or \\"not wasting the reader's time\\", then Tim Ferriss is a man that deserves a prime spot within the writer's pantheon.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef isn't just a book about mastering any skill, it is a self-fulfilling truth. It is absolute evidence that Ferriss lives life according to the philosophy laid out within his opus, as he certainly has mastered that most difficult art of writing.<br /><br />Incredibly good.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|I just want to say that when my package arrived, though it was well protected with bubble wrap inside, I was upset that my DVD was damaged in the case.  It was all broken and the discs were unattached from the holder ring.  This has never happened, but I don't know if this happened in route, or at the warehouse before it was packed.  I always deal with Amazon, but I was just totally upset and the fact that I didn't have my packaging slip included, otherwise I would have returned it right away.  But I can't at this point.  Thank goodness, though, the DVD plays ok, has bits where it skips but still would be able to watch it, more or less. I can't imagine what happened this time.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Well done with terrific effects. Good suspense. Thirteen more words. Balloon liquid counter theodore ketchup mustard rainbow asphalt tickle and rainspout
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The story was good. But it dragged in several places for me.  Not best Or greatest John Grisham I have read.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Plot seemed to go on and on.  If you are not familiar with British language you will find yourself kind of lost as to what they are talking about. The British have different names for things.  Re: bedsit for bedroom; lieu for bathroom; tube for subway.  These are just a few.  The read was heavy - on and on and on.  Until the very end, I could not figure out what the story was about or where their lives were leading.  What point was the author trying to achieve?  The book was okay but seemed a chore to read.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|It is not often that sequals are as good or better than the first movie. This one does a great job other than some of the CG is a bit cheesy. Great use of 2 hours of your time.
B004HUE57S|3.0|Easy to install and use.  I unfortunately bought a right handed and should have purchased the left hand.  Could have returned it but already destroyed the packaging. A little large for my female hand.  Could not relax my hand and manipulate as I would like.  All in all I think it is better for the hand than the normal mouse.  The handshake makes more sense for the wrist.  Eventually I will probable try the left hand Vertical Mouse.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Good actors and interesting action scenes. It could have been half as long and I would have given it more stars. It seemed to carry the same medium level of action throughout the whole thing. No real highs or lows.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|The characters are people you can relate to on a personal and professional level. The writers, the actors, and the acting are superb. I like it that I haven't them before.<br /><br />The periodicity of the show (the 60s) is well done and takes me back.  I like the styles!  They've done a great job of bringing in the social issues of day that pervaded our society and thoughts.<br /><br />I just love this show.
B004FP1WX0|3.0|It kept my date's and I's interest for the whole thing. Great incite into the realities of the online dating world. Would have been better if they followed up with people that were being impersonated.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Book Two continued to intrique me and add substance to the times involved and the wonderful characters.  I started reading these books after watching the great HBO series.  I see the characters in my mind as I'm quickly turning pages until my eyes are blurry.<br /><br />The characters developed more in Book Two and more history was revealed.  This is a masterpiece series of a fantasy world with human beings presented to us with flaws and strengths.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book...started off a little slow for my taste like the writer was trying to hard but it was still a great read.....so good that it made me wish the 3rd one was already out!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The HBO series prompted me to purchase this Kindle book.  I could not put it down and gobbled up each delicious tidbit and rich detail until I came slamming to the end.  This was in the middle of the morning (about 3 am) and I quickly ordered Book Two from The Kindle Store before I was able to relax and go to sleep.<br /><br />This book is a great read.  It is intensely written with extraordinary characters who come alive.  I cannot imagine any serious reader who would not enjoy and benefit from the story, unless you are unable to handle characters who dive into life with courage, honor, strength/weakness, lust, love,blood, guts, tragedy, triumph.<br /><br />Read them all you wil be the better for it.
B00181YT9S|5.0|I use these speakers mainly to listen to music and watch videos on my desktop and they do a superb job. This is a replacement for the M-audio studio pro 3 I had that started breaking down after 5 years of use. I used to own a Logitech 5.1 system but I found the bass to be too loud and distracting for watching videos/movies.<br /><br />These have a greater range than my old studio pro 3's and took some getting used to. I am able to hear more at the high frequencies, cymbals in songs I didn't notice before. Granted you will want to listen to 320 kbps mp3's to really notice the clarity in these speakers. I found the high frequencies are somewhat sharper than my studio pros which had a softer sound.<br /><br />I also like that the red LED is not too bright. One thing though is that they come only with an A/C power cable and an audio cable to hook up the right powered speaker to the left speaker. There is no analog/digital audio input cable provided.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Game of Thrones has intrigued me to the point where I read until my eyes are blurry.  Each of the two previous books was great, but book three takes us into more depth in charaacter history and development, as well as challenges, hazards and a few joys, answering some questions and posing new possibilities.<br /><br />Bran's abilities are developing.  Poor Sensa is much stronger than she knows.  Tyrion is one of my favorite characters and plays a significant role, once again, in this book.  Arya, our precious one, is turning into an adorable blood-thirsty youngling, and it will be interesting to see how she handles adolescence.  Jon has been sent from The Wall on a mission which will deepen his development.  Dany is gearing up for a plunge into fulfilling her destiny, with her dragons at her side, and may the old gods and the new help anyone who gets in her way or offends her sense of justice.  Cat inadvertently mucks up Rob's war strategy, in an attempt to free her captive daughters. The King Slayer, Cercei and her horrid &#34;darling&#34; son, Joff, continue to toss tainted meat into the stew that is the Game of Thrones.  The author blends good and bad, justice and injustice, and strength and weakness, in each character.  Of course, I'm totally in love with the Stark wolves and appreciative of their loyalty, love, and protection for each of the Starks.<br /><br />The world behind The Wall is developing in this book.<br /><br />Dont want to say too much more at the risk of becoming a Spoiler.  Book 3 has presented us with lust/love, blood, guts, sacrfice, magic, honor, courage, victories/defeats (small/great), and glory galore. The authors weaves a rich tapestry that illustrates the Game of Thrones.  .<br /><br />The writing is superb, history rich and vivid. Characters fully drawn and evolving with each chapter.  This is a fantasy masterpiece and a real page turner.  (Kindle readers will be using the dictionary to look up many of the Middle English, Medieval namesfor things used in the every day life of our beloved characters.)
0062183591|4.0|Dan Ariely Review  I am a student in the Carlow University Masters of Science in Fraud and Forensics [...]and am reading this book in the course Forensic Research and Analysis.  Ariely does a nice job to inform the reader that prevention of dishonest acts is the best way to stop dishonesty from occurring in the work place.  What I particularly liked about the book was the experiments he conducted and from the results, Ariely had scientific evidence that generally people have tendencies to act a certain way.  For example he does a study on cheating, where he tests to see if people are given the ability to cheat, will they and if so how far will they go?  The results were that when given the ability to cheat, people cheated, not by a lot but only by a little bit.  Ariely provided further insight on honesty and taught me that management, or even people in general, should pay special attention to the first act of dishonesty because once acts of dishonesty has taken place, the likelihood for more dishonest acts to follow dramatically increases.  From a prevention stand point, it is easier to fix dishonesty if it is spotted early, rather than damage control later.  In light of the many strengths of this book, the only weakness that I found was difficulty in relating the results of his study into a real world prevention application.  For example Ariely does a study on wearing fake designer clothing, his study finds that people that wear this fake clothing view themselves as dishonest, thus viewing the people around them as dishonest.  From a prevention stand point it is difficult to make the connection, if I am a manager and I notice one of my employees wearing fake designer clothing, I cannot assume this individual will act dishonestly.  Regardless, the book overall is good, but some of the experiments he conducts can be difficult to apply to your specific situation.  Overall, this book did prepare me as I pursue a professional career in fraud and forensics.  I feel thatbecause of this book I have a better understanding of people as a whole.  This book also reminds me to question the actions of others because a person, who thinks another is dishonest, is it because he or she truly is? Or is it because the accuser is dishonest and because they are dishonest, they are more likely to view the people around them as such?
B000244FDW|5.0|FYI: i just purchased the DVD and after watching it, noticed there were scenes that i didn't remember from previous viewings on my old VHS version. I double-checked the running times: 265 minutes vs. 226 minutes! Nothing earth-shattering added; just a few more scenes with Mrs. Bennett and poor Kitty. But more is always better when it's Jane Austen.<br />I saw this in 1984 on PBS. I knew NOTHING about the story or characters (i blame my high school English teachers for not making me read this!) and LOVED it from the start.<br />The \\"hate turns into love\\" story has always been one of my favorites.<br />What is best about this version:<br />-Mr. & Mrs. Bennett are true to the book. Other versions soften them up but he is sarcastic & selfish in the book and she is flighty, shallow & scatterbrained.<br />-Lizzie and Jane are wonderful with appropriate portions of beauty (Jane is prettier & Lizzie is intelligent & pretty & sassy).<br />-The Bingleys are wonderful; Mr.Bingley is NOT an idiot (as he was in the movie) and Caroline is a sly & formidable adversary.<br />-Lady Catherine is HILARIOUS as is Mr. Collins (although not people you'd want to spend any time with).<br />-There is a LOT of Jane Austen's dialogue AND Lizzie's internal monologues where she notes the shortcomings of her parents.<br />-You get to see the process of how Lizzie & Darcy come to appreciate each other. It involved a lot of time together...long walks and dinners at Rosings. They didn't just fall in love overnight.<br /><br />What is lacking:<br />-a swoon-inducing Mr. Darcy. David Rintoul is adequate, fairly handsome & snooty but cannot compare to Matthew M.<br /><br />SOMEDAY WHEN I HAVE TO TIME TO LEARN HOW TO EDIT:<br />i would like to weave together all the best bits from the 3 versions to make one PERFECT version!<br />-the movie for the EMOTIONS and Matthew M.<br />-the A&E version for ...not sure what exactly. (The prolonged dancing scenes go on way too long. And the actors are too old fortheir parts.)<br />-and this one for the characters & dialogue.<br />Perhaps when i'm in my 80s...
0061914177|4.0|I have seen Gary Vaynerchuk speak at TED talks. His talks are really motivating and full of energy and this book is a continuation of that. I read this book as part of the IEM course that I am attending at University of Alabama at Birmingham and I was not disappointed. The main points for me that he tries to put across points are why advertising using the internet as a medium makes sense today, why you should monetize your passion and love your family. I agree with the ideas that Gary has mentioned in this book as I have been working in the area of web app development for the past 7 years and have seen individual and companies benefit when they adopt internet as a business medium.  . He also lays stress to the importance personal branding plays in acquiring business opportunities. In this age `Everyone is watching you all the time`. He also discusses various mediums that you can use and gives his personal example of his family's wine business to establish the facts stated which by the way is very inspiring. Last but not the least he also mentions other moral aspects of business that should also be considered when you are running it.

1612680011|4.0|I got the book RICH DAD POOR DAD by Robert Kiyosaki as per the recommendation of my professor in the IEM course that I am attending at The University of Alabama at Birmingham. This book is a good read for all people in general and also to persons who have just started their financial planning. It documents what the author learnt from his two dads one of whom was financially rich and the other one was educated but financially poor. He tells you how having financial education is as important as having a regular education. Throughout the book he lays importance on assets and liabilities by telling you how acquiring assets help you improve your finances. He also lays emphasis on the fact that we should develop all round abilities instead of focusing in one area. The points that I have mentioned have been well covered by examples in the book.

B008AUGEFC|3.0|Let me start by saying that when I find a good book (Hunger Games, Harry Potter, anything by Nelson Demille or John Grisham) I usually binge read it within a few days.  This was not one of those.  No point in giving any plot synopsis--if you want to find out what it's about Google it.  But if you are unaware this book is written in a unique style: 6 'interwoven' stories about 6 very different people in 6 different times.  And Mitchell chose to tell the first half of each story in chronological order before concluding each story in reverse chronological order (1,2,3,4,5,6,6,5,4,3,2,1).  Unique, intriguing, and slightly confusing.  A big pet peeve of mine was at the end of the first story, when the saga pauses mid-sentence...a little warning would have been nice.  I was about ready to call the bookstore and complain about a missing page before I decided to check online and see if it may have been intentional.<br /><br />And don't buy into all the hype about delicate and intricate connections between the characters.  They don't exist.  Sure one character read part of a journal from another, listened to a composition from another, etc...but to me these are 6 independent stories thrown together because they aren't long enough/significant enough to stand alone.  People may lambaste me for saying that but, in my opinion, it is the truth.  And *SPOILER ALERT* (NOT REALLY) the supposed 'real connection' is a birth mark present on each of the characters.  Wow.  Truly mind blowing.  There are common themes about the human condition and some decent parallels between stories, but not enough to call these novellas linked.  It all seemed a bit forced.<br /><br />Honest to goodness review of the book: it starts off extremely dense and dry.  Were it not for the movie (which I have not seen) I would not have pushed through.  It wasn't until about halfway through the second story that I started to enjoy reading.  And for the most part that held true until we looped back around to thefirst story again.  Mitchell is a very talented writer, but as others have mentioned he seems a bit full of himself.  I'm never a fan of flowery writing so I was very irked at many points throughout the story.  I don't know if anyone else touched on it, but the 6th story (Sloosha's Crossin an Ev'rythin After) was written in quite possibly the most annoying style of all time.  Look, I get it, the character is a native with an accent.  Great.  Don't make me labor through reading his entire story for no reason.  Mitchell also developed a v. ann. habit of using abbreviations for no apparently reason.  See?  Is it really that hard to write out very annoying?  Did the publisher make him cut a few pages out so he deemed it prudent to lose them in that method?<br /><br />I may have spent a good portion of this review complaining about the book...but if I had never read the book I would almost definitely read it, knowing what I know now.  I can't give it a higher endorsement than that.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The concept was so unusual, I really liked it. Having a female as the hero was a great idea.  Women are always stronger than men. The writing was really well done and the characters were realistic.<br />Will recommend this to all  my friends.

1423113454|2.0|First, I understand that this is a kids' book. My expectations for a children's novel are different that my expectations for an adult sci-fi, which are different than my expectations for a literary classic. So don't dismiss this review simply on the grounds that I'm applying adult criteria to a book written for middle school kids. There are many books written for children that I can and do enjoy reading.<br /><br />However...<br /><br />[[ASIN:1423113454 The Red Pyramid (The Kane Chronicles, Book 1)]] was not one of them.<br /><br />This book is over 500 pages long, which is really pushing it for a kid's book (in my opinion). And the reason that it's 500+ pages is that Riordan refuses to advance the plot in a purposeful manner. Other reviewers have pointed out that the basic plot was \\"go here, do this; go there, do that\\", and I agree. But in the midst of all of that, Riordan doesn't tell us \\"WHY\\" they need to do this or that. He drops hints several times that certain characters know more than they are telling the Kane children, but he drags out the reveal for seemingly no other reason than to pad his page count. Random monsters are thrown into the story for action, and a timeline of just a few days is introduced to build tension, but it all feels very manufactured and unnecessary. The way that Riordan hints at plot points then distracts the reader with an action scene only to reintroduce that plot point 200 pages later is very overused and irritating. Obviously you don't want to reveal to much to the reader right off the bat. But you shouldn't tease them with hints for 400 plus pages just to say you wrote a longer story. The reader needs that information in order to be invested in the characters and what they are trying to accomplish. Simply saying \\"we're gonna go stop the bad guy\\" isn't enough to make a story good. Tell them what's going on so they become more invested in what happens!<br /><br />The characters felt like a jumbled mess. The two main characters, Carter and Sadie Kane, were not well defined and their few unique \\"traits\\" were really just stereotypical cliches. Carter was the bookworm nerd who's main characteristic was dressing like a 60 year old adult. Sadie was the rebellious teen with highlights in her hair and a perpetual bad attitude. They were both somewhat sarcastic and Sadie used some terms that I think might have been British (I can't say whether they are authentic and accurately used or not). Oh, and they miss their parents. Aside from that, there isn't any personality or depth to these characters. I can understand using cliches with characters in a children's book; Riordan did it fairly well in the Percy Jackson series. But here it doesn't seem like Riordan even put that much effort into his characters. There is nothing here to help the readers like or relate to these characters. They are boring and almost interchangeable. Which is sad because these are the MAIN CHARACTERS! You know, the ones whose adventures we're supposed to be following and whose fate we are supposed to care about... those main characters...<br /><br />On top of that, the alternating first person narrative is littered with bickering and sarcastic asides (it is supposedly transcribed from an audio recording, and these asides are set off by brackets). It was a misguided attempt at humor that eventually became so annoying that anytime I saw brackets I would skip ahead. Sarcasm may have worked with Percy Jackson, but here it is just reduced to bad attempts at jokes and mean spirited quarreling between the siblings.<br /><br />And the side characters are even less well defined. The \\"plot\\" moves Sadie and Carter around so much that they barely get to spend any time with anyone other than Khufu the baboon. And while Riordan is constantly dropping hints (with all the subtlety of a Looney Tunes anvil) that \\"These Characters Will Be Important Later!\\", we meet them so briefly that nothing can be learned about them and no real attachment is formed. You know that they'll turn up again at some point in the future and be relevant to the plot and you'd like to find out more about them, but for right now you just don't care.<br /><br />The thing about this book that really bothered me though was that the whole time I was reading it, I remember thinking \\"I already read this in Percy Jackson books\\". Even though elements of the quest are very different, the basic premise is mostly just a re-tailoring of \\"The Lightening Thief\\" with new characters and Egyptian mythology. Let me break it down for you.<br /><br />****SPOILERS****<br /><br />The story is narrated by Carter and Sadie Kane (Percy Jackson) in first person and they often insert sarcastic commentary on situations and make references to a family in-joke about a spatula (blue food). Carter and Sadie (Percy) are normal kids who get suddenly caught up into a world of magic and gods when their father (mother) is attacked by a god (minotaur) and taken into another dimension. After making this discovery they are whisked away to a \\"safe\\" house (camp) to be trained by their uncle Amos (Chiron) in the use of magic. They also discover they have been assigned a guardian deity named Bast (satyrr named Grover) who inserts random food jokes about Friskies (enchiladas and tin cans). The house (camp) is attacked by monsters and Sadie and Carter have to go on a quest to stop Set from building his pyramid (or recover a lightening bolt and stop Hades from starting a war with the gods). They are motivated to do this not so much to stop the \\"evil\\" Set (Hades) as much as by the desire to save their father (mother) from the god's clutches. Carter and Sadie both have dreams where their ba (or Percy's spirit) spies on the enemy and supposedly reveals his plans. They also discover that they are \\"possessed\\" by the gods Horus and Isis (or descended from Poseidon), whose power helps them achieve superior magical abilities. At the end of the quest it turns out that the god they thought was their enemy was only being used by an older, more deadly power named Apophis (Kronos) who was seeking to escape imprisonment. They were also betrayed by their uncle Amos (friend Luke) who was being possessed (manipulated) and used by Set (Kronos). Carter and Sadie (Percy), using the strength of Horus and Isis (Poseidon), fight and defeat the god Set (Ares) and restore a temporary peace. However Apophis (Kronos) still poses a great danger and the House of Life (or Olympian gods) refuse to take action in a way that will ensure his final defeat. In the end they were unable to free their father (mother) because they would not be able to both free him (her) and stop the enemy, but are afterward able to interact with both him and their mother as he is still possessed by Osiris and rules the Underworld (Hades releases Percy's mother after the return of his cloak).<br /><br />****SPOILER END****<br /><br />Obviously it's not a direct rip off, and the related characters change sometimes depending on where you are in the story. But it's close enough that it was distracting. I can understand a few similarities here and there (especially having children discover they had special abilities and needing to go somewhere to be trained, etc.). But there are so many similarities that it just feels like sloppy, uninspired writing. Riordan simply took the plot from \\"The Lightening Thief\\" and re-dressed it as \\"The Red Pyramid\\". And in my opinion, \\"The Lightening Thief\\" did a much better job of making this story arc work and providing fun narration, interesting (if somewhat cliche) characters, and good plot twists. Even the joke about the blue food worked better than that pathetic reference to death-by-spatula as part of a family quarrel (it was never explained like the blue food was, so the audience never got the joke). To top it off, \\"The Lightening Thief\\" told this story better in about 400 pages, more than 100 pages fewer than \\"The Red Pyramid\\".<br /><br />Finally, this series introduced the element of being possessed by gods in a very literal way, which was not present in the Percy Jackson series. Personally, I found it somewhat disturbing because of my own religious views. Some people may have different opinions, but parents should be aware that this issue is a part of this series. There was also some references to racism and mixed-racial marriages that felt out of place and irrelevant to this story.<br /><br />In my opinion, give this series a pass.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|I've read more than a dozen Ken Follett books -- from \\"Eye of the Needle\\", through \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" to \\"Fall of Giants\\". I would list some of his books amongst my all time favorites. As for \\"Winter of the World\\", all I can wonder is if Ken Follett actually wrote this book.<br /><br />I gave this book 2 stars only because I finished it and because I had some interest in the characters -- although that was probably left over from reading the first in this series, \\"Fall of Giants\\". I find it hard to believe that this book was written by the same author. The dialog was childish, the new characters were flat -- it was as if someone had read a 6th grade level history book of this time frame and then said \\"let's stick some characters in\\".<br /><br />If I kept track of all the little comments and \\"plot twists\\" that seemed laughable to me, it would probably amount to 1/4 the book.<br /><br />Extremely disappointing.

0446580848|2.0|The basic story is a good one but it was easy to see what the end was going to be like, about two thirds through the book. The background information on Yeman and the problems after the USS Cole bombing was well done. However this could have been a great 5-star book if it was half the length that was published. The author repeats the same phase \\"all Yemani men carry an AK47\\" many many times. He tells the same short story twice during the book; early on and then near the end. The main character \\"thinks\\" and \\"talks\\" about the same subject multiple times and adds nothing to the main story. Also the main character and the author seems to have a major hate for the CIA and we have to \\"hear about\\" this multiple times; I guess the author must think we are so dumb that he has to repeat and repeat something to get it into our heads. My wife and I begain to hope that the author would kill off the main character about half way through the book since he is an real \\"jerk\\" and needs something to happen to him.<br />If you got lots of spare time this is the book for you, but if you prefer a fast read this book is not recommended.
B0086449YA|4.0|I own most if not all of Mark Knopfler's albums and first listened to both sides on a road trip. The songs get even better when you are able to read the lyrics while listening to the songs. I guess the tracks that caught my attention first were &#34;Corned Beef City&#34;, &#34;I Used To Could&#34;, and &#34;Gator Blood&#34;, but a lot of the slower tracks are good as well. I have been a fan of MK from his days as the genius of Dire Straits, but his lyrics, vocals and guitar playing are strong enough for solo work. If you are a fan, this album is well worth adding to your collection
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have had the pleasure of reading all 3 books and am very glad I did. These well written books meander you through what passionate, unconditional love is like and it renewed my belief that soul mates exist. I found joy in watching Mr. Grey work through his issues to begin to believe he's worthy to be loved. His life was completely enriched by the chance meeting of Miss Steele and was forever changed!<br /><br />I would recommend this trilogy to everyone who has an open mind, is not judgemental and enjoys exceptional writing!  E.L. James, is a literary master, in my opinion

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I love to hear the stories of people who do not believe in God, but God has a way of pulling them in to His fold.  This was a supreme example of just that.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it got a bit technical for me in certain sections, as it was written by a doctor and described his medical situation.  Other doctors, nurses, etc., will have a greater understanding of those parts than I did, as I'm an accountant.  However, I loved, loved his story of finding the Greatest Love of God during his unexpected illness.  Could see that it was important for the author to describe his condition in detail, for it was a miracle that he lived through it.  That was clear...
B008Y1YKE4|4.0|My boys (ages 3 and 5) adore this movie. A futuristic take on Christmas with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos to explain how Santa can do his job in only 1 night....sure to become a holiday tradition in our house!
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Very enjoyable read.  I love mysteries, but somehow had never read any of Agatha Christie's books.  After reading this one, I had another downloaded to my Kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it, too.  Like a good wine, this was complex.

075669812X|5.0|This is a great book at a great price. My 8 year old loved it. Much cheaper than in the stores. Highly recommend this book.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Gregory Peck is outstanding.  Truly all of the cast is phenomenal.  I miss movies like this.  Actors that act with out special effects.
030758836X|5.0|Really great read. I couldn't put it down. Sharp, perceptive writing. This is the first book I've read by the author, and I'm truly impressed. Great suspense, and really disturbing yet thought-provoking glimpses into human psyches. The ending just makes it more powerful.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Only thing to rise is your arm checking exactly how much torture you endured watching this seemingly interminable failure of a formulaic Hollywood movie. We witness all the cliches, one dimensional characters and plot predictability stuffed into a barely coherent story line.<br /><br />The trend of a pseudo-heroine character more aggravating than she's worth to the plot has long been a Hollywood staple.  The audience is subjected to her most nefarious deeds only to be forgiven by and eventually falling in love with the hero. In this regard the strange looking Ms. Hathaway does not disappoint. She has finally found a role that is actually more annoying than she is. At one point Hathaway's villainy surpasses that of Bane's, and three quarters into the movie one cannot help but hope that someone, anyone goes ahead and triggers the nuke ridding us of her odious character once and for all. Alas, wishful thinking- we must endure her presence till the very end.<br /><br />To reward us (or perhaps make amends) for the time wasted on this movie, the writers include a rather pathetic variation on the \\"Luke, I am your father\\" bombshell. While I will not reveal this ultra-super-duper-secret identity of the real villainous mastermind, I will mention that the very lovely Ms. Cotillard does give a decent performance.<br /><br />Having alluded to Star Wars, it is only fitting that I extend the analogy further to include Bain, who by all accounts is nothing more than a rehashed bi-manually intact Darth Vader but sporting a Hannibal Lecter muzzle instead.
1400069289|5.0|Very good and inspiring, recommend everyone to read it and learn about your habits and how it effects your everyday life.
6305428387|5.0|I cant wait to give this DVD as a gift for Christmas, this was on a wish list and I'm happy to deliver.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I have an entire library of young people movies - they are for those quiet times with my grandchildren when we want to relax with a movie. Always great prices through Amazon.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This is a great book!  Referred to me by my 18 year old, believe it or not!  The paradigm has shifted for her and it's not too late for me.  Every family should read this book.  You make your life what you want it to be; don't let life and non-sensical tradition make you!!!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I purchased this Blu-ray to finish off my collection of Harry Potter videos. I have learned that shopping on Amazon gives me good prices, the selection I'm looking for and rapid delivery.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|This is a &#34;fun&#34; upbeat album that is very catchy and easy to sing along with.  Different from their second album but just as good.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|This is a fantastic album. He's got a beautiful voice and I find his music, with the exception of a song or two, completely relaxing. In fact &#34;Kiss Me&#34; was the song my husband and I danced to at our wedding. Buy anything from this man. (Who doesn't love a ginger?)
B007SGM084|5.0|I mean, come on.. its 50 shades.. need more of an explanation?? VERY good love story.. and its nice and steamy in all the right places.. i read the entire series in about a week. I am utterly in love with the characters. Excellent. cannot wait to see the movie.
B007NCSQFO|5.0|I think everything she touches turns to gold. I just wish I hadn't bought the explicit version so I could listen to it with my son around.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Libby Day believes this deep into her self.  She has survived the deaths of her mother and two sisters.  They died in one night of horror, and Libby, under the guidance of a court psychologist, has testified that her brother Ben had killed them all.  She spends her life escaping her life.  She lives on the proceeds of the donations that people had sent to her.  After a lifetime being unwanted, she is almost broke.<br /><br />The Murder Club finds her and for staged stipends, she begins the trail of people who may know her brother Ben is innocent.  For Libby knows that her testimony was coached from a small frightened girl.  In alternating chapters from the day of the murder 19 years ago,and the search that Libby now pursues, we also follow the quest for the truth.<br /><br />Of course, my favorite is Libby.  Her mother remembers her as her &#34;worrier; she came out of the womb wary and stayed that way.  She was the nightmare girl, the fretted.&#34;. Her birth was a surprise, her life always scrabble poor.  After the murders, as one girl tells her, &#34;You think after what what happened there's any peace for you sweetheart?&#34;. Libby has lived to bury what she knows, and this takes a tremendous toll on the soul.  I don't think she was ever the rotten person she sees in herself, but her voyage to rebirth is going to hurt.<br /><br />Second in line is Ben.  &#34;he was born to be lonely, that's what he knew for certain.&#34;. He is never clear to us till the very end.<br /><br />The characters portrayed in enough depth to engage us fully.  We can visualize each person.  But enough is left blank for the reader to decide.  The zeitgeist of the time both of the murder and of twenty years later, are sparkling with ambient detail.  The Murder Club that holds to old crimes to decipher and to re-enact, propel us into the murders of their ages and how the era and the crimes mold each other.  There are places in the book that made me gnash in its obvious choices, but the next chapters do in fact redeem themselves. It is scary.  It is sad. But worth reading.xt chapters do in fact redeem themselves. It is scary.  It is sad. But worth reading.
1609611543|5.0|I found the book to be very interesting.  I do have Celiac disease and want to keep my blood glucose down, so I found this information very benefical.  I plan to change the flours I use, so I can become healthier.  If I make a difference in my diet, I shouldn't have to see the doctor so much.  That is important to me; to stay healthier on the long run.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|these are crap games, don't waste your time with this app. even after I removed it, I get notifications to update.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This has worked better for taking class notes than any of the others that I have tried. I am a dyslexic student at SDSU. EVERNOTE has changed the way I take notes and has made studying so much easier! I suggest this for anyone in school.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I had a hard time getting into this story.  Once I did though, it is o.k.  Not one of my favorite books.

B002RVCD6O|5.0|What can I say about The Half-Blood Prine except this book is one of my favorite HP books. Absolutely and thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I have always liked puzzles but never have the time. Now I can work on one while I'm impatiently waiting at appointments.
B004GYY714|3.0|This app has gotten really annoying since they updated it with a little commercial before loading a channel. All it says is &quot;You're listening to the world's radio. On TuneIn!&quot; It wastes 10 seconds just to tell us what app we're using. We obviously know that if we're using the app. It's so pointless, and serves only to remind me who is annoying me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great read, kept me guessing the whole time.  I absolutely loved it and reccomend it! Great vacation book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you started out with watching the series on TV, then you'll love the book because there's much more stuff/people missing from the TV version, and the book produces a much more graphic image of the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once you start the trilogy you can't stop.  I bought them back to back so that I could finish the story.  Great reading.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book actually has information with the potential to change your whole damned life for the better, it is much more than a cook book, it is a life book. If you can get someone to read it (the younger the better) they could become a much more well rounded individual and that's better for the whole of society. I bought the Kindle edition first and found the info great, then bought the book itself, it's a work of art,top quality.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had to force myself to read as much as I did.  It's boring.  Same stuff over and over.  I didn't finish it but I'm thinking about it.  Too much hype.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Approaching this film with much trepidation and fear that it would be another saccharine kid's movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it avoided most of the cloying aspects of the genre.  The story is a delight from beginning to end.  The 'tongue in cheek' gruffness of the Conductor (Tom Hanks) saves his scenes from going 'over the top'.  Technically, it is breathtaking.  Even after several viewings, it never fails to amaze me.  A film for all the family to enjoy.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very enjoyable story with a unique presentation. It's a series of interviews from survivors all over the world representing many different nations. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to the upcoming movie.
0393312836|5.0|I have read thousands of books in my life, and am a very picky person.  This book, however, is honestly the best it can get.<br />It is written in a weird and crazy format, but somehow reminds me of the way I write poetry, so I actually enjoyed it. It is written on a blank canvas, with ideas pointing to what it is trying to say, while also being fully open to interpretation. The points about life it raises are remarkable and are hard to go unnoticed. For example, one day my mom asked me if the government should legalize the use of marijuana.<br />I said of course!<br />My mom said that is not Christian of people to do.<br />And I responded:  Mom, just because people don't do things they shouldn't, simply because they are not allowed, does that make<br />them a better person? No, it makes them A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />And that is what this book is all about, choice and will. Freedom, it's extent and limitations. What do the acts of each and everyone of us really say about the kind of person we are? Does society have any effect on decisions that can lead to happenings not intended upon?<br />The answer is for you to decide by gathering evidence buried deep in the many hidden gems of this story. There is so much to learn from this book, and that is why it is truly unique. But oh ya, there is a heck of a lot of digging to do with this story, and that is why some people hate it so much.<br />*******NOTE: This book is also extremely explicit, repulsive, and spectacularly horrifying.  Kind of scarred me for life. Involves grotesque rape and murder scenes, be wary.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is amazing! IT downloaded pretty much faster then some apps I have downloaded. I have a kindle fire though so I am not sure if it works well on a tablet of any sort. It has great graphics and many goals that you can try to accomplish. I have played this app before but on my friends iPad and she recommended it for me when I get a kindle for my birthday. ON THE iPad version IT was flawless but on my kindle IT would not turn the sharp corners when I slid my finger across the screen.  It all so wouldn't jump, but this was rare to find. I hope this works out for you! :D :D
0547884591|4.0|I haven't read all of the book yet, but in true Tim style, I am loving it so far.  There are always a few techniques in his books that I have to read over and over again, and this one is no exception.  However, his style of writing is so entertaining that although the books are lengthy - they are totally worth it.<br /><br />I also recommend purchasing his CreativeLive session he did a few weeks ago.  Amazing stuff!  Keep up the good work, Tim.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I was very disappointed with the sound in conjunction with an iphone.  It was flat sounding and had VERY low output.  Bummer!!<br />For this to work on an iphone 5, you will need an additional mic adapter for around $25. It is an adapter, so it is not perfectly suited for the iphone-the volume is very low.  You have to almost yell, put the mic 1 inch from your mouth, or boost the volume on post production. (bummer) I don't know if there is another adapter that will work.  Let me know if you have any tips! There is discussion on youtube for tips and options for use with an iphone.
030759565X|5.0|As always. There is not one recipe in this book that I would not make; especially not after Deb's thoughtful prose and beautiful photographs. This is a book to snuggle up on the couch with and read cover to cover with a fancy drink and then spend the rest of the weekend in the kitchen trying everything!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I enjoyed this final book in the trilogy as much as the first two.  Too bad Mr. Larsson won't be writing anything else...

B009G8GRX6|5.0|I've got tons of Muse on my iPod and I'm glad to add this album. Just as good as the rest.
1416955070|3.0|Honestly, I read this book because I saw the trailer for the movie before Breaking Dawn part 2 and had read reviews that it was going to be the next big young adult thing after Twilight and Hunger Games.  After reading it, I would be surprised if thats true.<br /><br />The book kept me interested and I never felt the urge to abandon it yet I was left with no real desire to continue the series.  The characters are under-developed for my taste and I wasn't particularly interested in either of the romantic developments.  If a story doesn't hook me with the characters, then I hope to be hooked by the world or setting that the book takes place in.  In this respect, it had the feel of having \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" thrown in.  Angels, demons, werewolves, vampires, faeries, you name it.  The catchphrase \\"all the stories are true\\" is definitely a theme.<br /><br />I am a big SF/F reader and am not opposed to feeling like a central idea of a story has been done before... as long as the story has something unique and interesting going for it.  Bottom line:  It was interesting, but I wouldn't read it again and I wouldn't recommend it to a friend.
B000I9S69K|5.0|If you've seen it, then you know why.  If you haven't, you will.  That's all you need to know.  Buy it today!

1401307450|5.0|I read this book during high school and it honestly changed me. Such rawness and sincerity. I will go back to this book and become a better person for reading it.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I was going to purchase this because I am a huge Indiana Jones fan, but after doing so research I found that the UK release of this complete adventure is VASTLY better. It comes with a Film cell and a leather bound replica of Dr. Jones' Journal! ITS AWESOME. Why in the US they would not release that superior edition I do not know. It is very sad. Maybe its a production issue. Never the less it seems to me that the UK always has the better releases. They always have cooler covers and they almost always have a Steelbook case for their releases. Needless to say I ended up getting the better version off Ebay. but maybe amazon UK has some in stock?

B009DJB9HC|5.0|BCC has produced another very strong album which seems to reflect greater blending and coherence as a band.  Joe B's solos are less bombastic and fit tighter into the songs.  The lyrics seem better written and the vocals continue to be Glenn Hughes powerful and full of range and expression.  Joe's vocals are excellent as well and there's more blending of them with Glenn's.  I feel that the drumming is much stronger and tighter on this album.  The drum tone and the depth of the bass drum seem more distinctive and a little more up front than the first two albums.  I can also hear more Derek on keyboard.  More of the songs contain more of his significant contribution to the overall sound and feel of the songs.  I have heard rumors of infighting and that possibly this is the last album.  I hope this isn't so!  I would so much want to see this band live.  Can you imagine how big they would have been some years ago?
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|This one took me by surprise. I wasn't familiar with the movie at all. So, we took a leap of faith and rented it.<br /><br />Wowzer! This was a nail biter until the very end.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Don't understand the alternate ending though. First ending was my preference!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Well written and the characters were well portrayed. The movie background was not too dark as many of the action moveis often are. Suggest renting.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book is really good because the book has really good details and the book is not always have a lot of words.
0547884591|5.0|I read the book twice cover to cover, I gave up my role as a Chef some 20 years ago and have focused on Business Process Management. The Four Hour Chef while having some amazing recipes and approaches to food, is a book that covers much more. The idea of hacking a Process what ever it is, Cooking...or learning Italian is the real take away for me. I have been married to an Italian for years who always complains on my ability to master her language, and has me analysing every verb which drives me nuts! Today i get it and I now understand how to use the language in a mode that i can feel confident and keep learning! Big Thanks!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Read some critiques of this that weren't so positive. However, in spite of everything, watching it on DVD made me wish I'd seen it in theaters.
B004JOCU2O|5.0|Very enjoyable movie - something the whole family can watch - great action with a message. Sometimes experience is the best answer. The characters make the story come alive.
B0054VVRBQ|3.0|Once I finally got this thing working in my Macbook Pro it was great. Getting it to work wasn't exactly fun though. Transcend really needs to update their Mac drivers for those of us running Lion or Mountain Lion. You can get it to work but you're own your own!<br />I emailed support asking for suggestions and help on getting it working but NEVER heard back! Oh well, they would probably just give me the typical &#34;reinstall&#34; crap anyways.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|This movie has amusing parts, but the love story between the younger two characters was not what I expected. More focus should have been put on the aging rocker story.
B000FBFN1U|2.0|When I started reading A Game of Thrones, I was fascinated by the storyline and characters.  As the story continued through the next few books, many (if not most) of the main characters, or at least my favorite ones, were killed off by the author.  What began as a sort of shock therapy has finally resulted in my lack of interest.  Whether or not all the killing gives the story a feel of realism, the truth is that fiction is supposed to be entertainment.  Martin has not been able to replace the characters with others of equal interest.  It's like your sibling who has been married 4 times -- it's impossible to care as much about number 4 as you did earlier.  For me, I'm done; I'm not moving on to volume four.

This seems unfair!

B004NS710C|4.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was pretty much non stop and action packed from beginning to end. I will watch this again. Worth the rental price in my opinion. Fun and just entertaining all the way around.

B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Every Step Up gets better and this one was just, smooth.  More choreography and more mixed styles.  The museum scene is worth seeing over and over.  I first saw this in the theater and was left with the idea that all reform just needs a good choreographer to become possible.

B008DW6VOQ|4.0|This Kindle App is very similar to the Android Phone App. The Kindle App updates very quickly and often, and the My Stocks page sets up very easily and displays more information than the Android Phone App, not requiring a column tap to rotate through the various values.<br /><br />However, the news layout is somewhat less efficient. Rather than a single collapsible stream of headlines that can be very quickly scrolled from a single page for access, this Kindle App is based on six boxes set in a rectangular arrangment, the top left being a single top news story and the remaining, thematic choices set by the user. The boxes contain only three or four headlines of each subsection. The full list of news articles are available as a scrolling side bar after the user accesses a new page containing one of the boxed articles.<br /><br />Bloomberg is still the best business and finance news source for all levels of user.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I first read this book as a youngster of about 11 or 12. When I recently purchased a Kindle this was a must-add to my reading list, especially considering it's free! I read through it in two days. It's not an excessicely long book, and it's nice easy read for most everyone. A very interesting book written from the point of view of a dog, &#34;Buck&#34; and his journey from his home to the gold rush. I would recommend this book to just about anyone. It's a classic!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I enjoyed this version of the MIB theme, it was interesting and different. To see K as a young agent was a hoot,and J's reaction to him was a blast as well. I enjoyed the film and do not in any way regret my purchase. I still think MIB1 is the best but this was as good (or perhaps a bit better) than MIB2. And \\"thats my story and I'm stickin to it\\" :)
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|I downloaded this book for free.  It has some interesting information about HTML 5 but it is not a thorough  and complete review of HTML 5.  Still, it was worth it for free.

B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|New Girl is a show that I'm very fond of. I love the characters and the writing. The fights between anyone and Schmidt always have me laughing hysterically. It's first and foremost a fun show. They don't really tackle any deep issues here but there's an interesting bent to it. They hide darker themes in it like mortality and the fact that all of them are just treading water. They're having fun doing it and they're not ready to get out of the pool yet but the idea that they are all, in some way losers, know it, and are someday going to have to move beyond that is present in every episode.<br />If you're a fan of shows like Friends and Scrubs or even Happy Endings and Don't Trust the B in Apt 23, you'll have a good time with New Girl. You'll get used to and even come to love that idiot Schmidt (trust me. I never thought I'd get used to him let alone that he'd become my favorite character). Nick's faces are always a topic of conversation in our house and Winston's absurdity gets more apparent as the series goes on. These are great characters that you see develop over time and you come to know and love them.<br /><br />The DVD-- okay... If this is your first time watching the show, you'll probably be fine, but if, like me, you've watched it since day one and have been waiting not-so-patiently for this thing to come out you're going to be disappointed.<br /><br />-The blurb on the back of the box is almost an insult to the show and makes it sound like so much garbage. I don't know how the copy is supposed to entice anyone to watch this show. I don't like knowing its there, not paying justice to such a fun show.<br /><br />-3 commentaries. 3. That's it. If you had ideas of watching the entire season with some companionable chit-chat going on for 24 episodes you can just get rid of them now.<br /><br />- There are a few short specials in which they talk about clothing/style and the evolution of an episode, a gag reel, deleted and extended scenes, alternate jokes, Winston'saudition, and a sneak peek at Ben and Kate.<br />That sounds like a lot until you take into consideration that they only did 3 commentaries for this thing. They didn't include such interesting things as a photo gallery of the roommate applications (these are on the website and are pretty funny) and they did not include the music video of the opening theme song. That seems paltry, I know, but the music video is interactive and there are tons of different versions of it. It would have been nice to have them all in one place. There are many many little  interviews online including the origin of the douchebag jar and the True American drinking game. Some of them may have come out after the dvd was done but these are things that could have been asked for interviews for the dvd or they may have come out naturally on the 21 commentaries they didn't do. I can only hope that they'll be included on the season 2 dvd but I think they are banking on people buying them from amazon.<br />If I sound bitter, I am... I've waited a while for this dvd and there's nothing on it that is worth waiting for if, like me, you wanted extras.
B005SZAEYO|2.0|If you like your characters to behave as if they were all 10 years old, then this is for you. If though, you expect people to at least behave in a rational, thinking, realistic fashion even 20% of the time, don't bother. Seriously, these actors should all be dope slapped for their behaviors in character and slapped again for taking these roles.

B0007MWZEK|3.0|Approximately 4 years ago I purchased the cordless swivel sweeper via some late night TV-watching.  I loved it and used it to death.  Literally.  A couple of months ago it died; I dropped it and it wouldn't start again.  I reordered, this time through Amazon.  When I received the sweeper the first thing I noticed was that the color had changed.  The second thing noticed was that the charger didn't work.  Well, OK, I figured, I had kept the battery and charger from the old sweeper, I would use it.  However, I'm still using it --neither the battery nor the charger that came with the new sweeper work.  The sweeper, itself, is great.  I use it to pick up cat litter after I scoop or clean the box, and it also picks up cat hair, crumbs and such with no problem.  I use it on floors and carpet and it works well on both.  It is not used as a vacume, but as a spot sweeper and works wonders for the little jobs for which it is used.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has rocked with lots of action and great characters.  Going to be hard to wait out this break for the rest of the season.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking Up Married by Mira Lyn Kelly<br />Megan Scott is a woman with a plan. No more relationships. No more hurt. She was taking her life and moving forward. She wanted a child and would raise it on her own, once she decided on how to get said child. Who knew that going to Vegas for her cousins wedding and having a few too many drinks would end up with her plans all askew?<br /><br />Connor Reed was a man who also had his plans. Find a woman who didn't want a fairytale life or a love relationship but just happy being a family that liked each other. He didn't plan for it to come to be while in Vegas but he wasn't a man to turn his back on opportunity either.<br /><br />Plans don't always turn out like you want though. This partnership could only work if they could keep emotions out of the way. And I know there were plenty of emotions because they jumped right out of the book. This was definitely a book that the Kleenex needed to be close at hand, at least for this reader. I really enjoyed this story.<br />**Sexual situations<br />**Received through NetGalley for review
B009MF5BXK|2.0|Geriatric Rambo. Lots of stuff getting shot up or blown up. Otherwise it's pretty lame. Not on my Christmas list.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Ferriss definitely has a distinct style and his book may seem a bit scattered but if you like his previous work or are at all entrepreneurialy minded reading this book is pure pleasure.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|It's an all time favorite of family.  I have many John Wayne movies (even the B ones) and we just love his swagger.  Even at Thanksgiving this year, this was the movie we watched and enjoyed after the feast.  We just love the movie especially the mud fight, the stairs scene, and especially the ending chase.  It's has what you want in a movie - Happiness, Sadness, Joy, Romance and Laughter.  We just love it.  5 stars
B002VLNB1Q|4.0|such an awesome talent ... the songs are catchy and fill the ears.  it is a joy to hear such well constructed music!
B0086700CM|4.0|its a vary fun game but its kinda hard on the kindle and it needs to be a part where u can pick the difficult
B004PVKFR8|5.0|So very good.  Has some filler songs in it, and WTF with the &#34;Some kind of creature&#34;? But &#34;Kill your heroes&#34;, &#34;Not your fault&#34;, &#34;Burn it down&#34;, and of course &#34;Sail&#34;, are all spectacularly good.
B003WUYP56|5.0|I am about as science literate as a nail clipper, I like to stretch my tiny mind every once in a while and , I have been stretched, twisted and I love it.  I may have to read it again to understand what I know, but WOW, physics is the bomb.So read this book, get physical!

B001N3OJEG|5.0|This is a great film for many reasons. First it has possibly the best screenplay ever.<br />The casting is brilliant. The use of L A locales make the film have a reality that most<br />of this kind, filmed on a back lot, do not have. It echos the best of Hollywood crime mysteries of the past<br />in all the right ways. The cherry (no pun intended) on the top has to be Kim Basinger's performance.<br />She moved from Lynn Bracken to a Veronica Lake imposter with ease and perfection. It was subtle<br />and moving. She kept Lynn's pain  just below the surface at all times. This film is a must. It is no wonder<br />that this was the critic's pick for best of the year over the blockbuster,Titanic.
B000000H3Z|5.0|The title says it all. if you like old metal from back when it really was metal this album is for you.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this album, but I love it. I was pleasantly surprised to find an illusion to Alice in Wonderland in one of the songs.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|Seems, Mark is actually pretty good at this fiction writing. i would definitely recommend it to technical and non technical people
B009X5Q944|4.0|such an awesome talent ... the songs are catchy and fill the ears.  it is a joy to hear such well constructed music!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a brilliant writer, and it's nice to read the &#34;director's cut&#34; of such an amazing book.  A+!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is one of the best games I have ever played it is awesome I have almost unlocked every player it is soooooooo fun
B005PTQPU0|4.0|In keeping with the theme of winter as a season of loss, isolation, and despair, Kate crafts one of her strongest records in years.  Clearly she had a strong idea of where she wanted to go with the production process-- it was one of her quickest albums, and took only a year to make.  Gone are the flighty idiosyncrasies of earlier works.  Instead, this record sounds somber and (in some cases) mournful.  It is a mature effort that reflects a transition for Kate, and she has certainly lost none of her creative power.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|I can't decide what I hate most about this movie. The writing is awful, the jokes are cheap and dull, the acting is below average and the plot is ill-conceived. The fact that this movie has a rating of 8.4 on IMDB is a travesty and I only have a pathetic fanbase to blame.<br /><br />I promise that I am not the case of a fan with great expectations who has been let down by a movie marginally lower than my impossible standard. I expected to see an 8.4. I would have accepted a 6.5. I have been duped by realistic 4.0 produced by Joss Whedon and his clan of drooling idiots.<br /><br />I have never been no disappointed by people. I would have thought that 406,000 reviewers would constitute a sufficient sample population, but apparently the marketing staff did an excellent job of ensuring many idiots would flock to the theatres to inflate this movie's revenue to upwards of $1.5 bil. for 2012. These idiots immediately turned to the internet to spread the word, and I took the bait.<br /><br />I owe myself an apology for having spent $3.99 to watch this turd. Thankfully, no taxes were applied.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Love it while I had it!  My nephews and nieces use it all the time May get at a later date.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I love the series usually reading the entire book the first weekend after it comes out.  One problem.  This new writer refers to Jack Ryan Jr. as the president's eldest child.  What happened to his sister who was injured in the third book?  How can a Clancy book make an error like that?  i am very disappointed but i still like the book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Makes me look forward to mondays. As soon as I get home from work i't Im watching. Give me more!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I had heard alot of people talking about how good this show was so I finally rented off Netflix and now I'm hooked.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|Ok B movie. Acting was average. The font used in the tile opening graphics is the worst choice ever in film history. That other movie Tuskegee Airmen was much better at tugging the heart.
B008B68IV8|5.0|my girls just love the new scaris line! my 7 yr old loves ghoulia, but at times her hair styles arent always flattering. this one is a knockout! i waited with this in my cart for days...and as soon as it was available via amazon i jumped on it.

1451695195|5.0|I love this book very much because it rings all the bells of truth and knowing in me.<br />Dr Eban Alexander has had this experience as the man,doctor, scientist and mystic that he is at this particular time in the evolution of humanity's experience because it calls us all to the memory of who we really are and where we have come from. It is about time we remembered! One person is all of us.....connected and at One.....how full of Grace and Miracle is that?
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I just ordered a brand-new Remastered Terminator (NOT THIS ONE HERE) from Amazon.UK for a total of $20.48 US dollars (includes 6-8 day standard shipping).<br />  I'm a cheap bastard that usually insists on waiting until I can find what I want for $10 or less...but not this time!<br />  Merry Christmas to me!!!<br />  It's Region Free, so it should work OK in U.S. BTW...UK reviews on this remaster are very enthusiastic.<br />  Don't wait until U.S. release in February 19th (according to Blu-Ray.com)<br />  Get it now!<br />  Here's the link to the promised land!<br /><br />  http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003BNY6YY/ref=ox_ya_os_product<br /><br />  UPDATE: I just watched my new copy (NOT THIS ITEM HERE) from Amazon UK and it is AWESOME!<br />  I give it a 4 stars for picture quality and 4 stars for sound quality. (pretty good for a movie from the early 80's)<br />  Impress your friends...Give it to the Home Theater buff in your life!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|love love love it she watches it a few times a weekjust as great as the other pixar movies will definatly be getting 2 and 3
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Everything went really smoothly! Thanks I really appreciate doing business with people do a great job.  Looking forward to more great amazon purchases.  Just love getting new music especially the stuff that is tried and true
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.  The price was a very good deal.  The shipping came to me within 2 days of my purchase and it was wrapped nicely so as not to damage.  I haven't been able to play the disc since it is wrapped and I am giving it as a gift, but I really have no concerns about it being a quality product.
B009329Y30|2.0|I liked the premise of the movie - military veteran rebuilds his life after devastating losses, meets girl, falls in love, etc., etc.  Almost too cheesy, however.  I don't think the chemistry between the actors was so great either.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Pretty good, kept the boys (3 + 5) interest for the whole movie.  They like some of the other animated movies like How to Train Your Dragon and Tangled better.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|Very disappointing screwball movie. I love romantic comedies but I am not sure that that is what this actually was.<br />I liked all the actors although Kevin Kline really disappointed me by taking this part and the story could have been absolutely charming if not for the whole teenage boy element (idiotic jokes, menstruation discussion, ugly off color comments, etc.) but the worst for me was the language.<br />Come on people! If you don't have enough imagination to come up with actual dialog and can only think of 4 letter words as filler then please PLEASE stop trying to write and give it over to someone who can.<br />The only really enjoyable part was the music and even that would have been enhanced with less raunch and soft porn. I was surprised to find that Natalie Portman was actually one of the co-producers on this film. Were I her I'd have kept my money in my pocket.<br />I managed to watch all the way through when I was tempted to turn it off but I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't but I will say that I am glad for the HEA and this is one movie I won't bother to watch again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Love Love this book! So funny and just a great perspective on life, keeps you light hearted! Love Tina Fey!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy!  I'm sad lt's over.  The characters are very well written and while slightly predictable, the story is very entertaining.  Its a fast read.  I loved them all.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I purchased this movie when it was on sale.  I had no issues with the Blu Ray.  It was a good buy.
B005MLOOJA|3.0|Great legal storylines and trial action.  I began losing interest in Season 2 because the main character remains aloof and cold to most of what comes into her life.  She shouldn't be so put together and so analytical.  But I still enjoy the legal storylines and how the main characters prevail in the courtroom.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Absolutely great! I don't think you can find a better gift for any Smashing Pumpkins fan.<br />Get the vinyl version it's pure class. I have it and although the song \\" zero\\" sounds a bit different than the version on the old cd version, the rest of the LPs play just fine.<br />Love the book and the album covers, pure class.<br />Get it till the price stays this way, I think it's quite a nice deal.
0316228532|5.0|There is no doubt J.K. Rowling knows how to tell a story.  It was a pleasure to follow all the characters and their intertwining lives. I truly enjoyed this look into a British village and it's social fabric.  This is social commentary at it's best, the story was interesting, sometimes funny but also touching and thought-provoking.
B000LRVLPK|1.0|TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:<br /><br />I wish I could say a lot about this watch, but I couldn't. I have not receive this watch and I can't call them or anything. No number to call. Please help![[ASIN:B000LRVLPK Swatch Dark Phoenix Unisex Watch YCS429]]
B005M4K94G|5.0|This CD I think is really good, it might not be for everybody but it's worth a listen if your thinking about it. I think it's GREAT !!!!!
B0035H99WK|2.0|This sounds like a nice concept, and it worked well while I had it, but after a month of use it died. The pieces holding the clip to the rest of the item tore through with what i would consider regular use. If you were to use it occasionally on a camping trip, etc. it would probably be ok. For everyday use though, it won't last, which is sad. I liked it while it lasted. But it won't last.
B00004TH83|4.0|I love this CD. She has a big voice that soars and soars with seemingly limitless range. She really went for it on this album.  Every song is strong on this bestselling CD.  Gave it to my woman friend and she loves it.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|I highly recommend it if you're interested in understanding the life of someone suffering from an eating disorder.  It seems to be a really raw, honest account of Portia's years of struggling with disordered eating.  It's also really well written - it's hard to put down & inspiring from beginning to end.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Best MIB movie. Much better than the other two. I cried at the end. This one explains a lot about the first two.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Imaginative, entertaining and suspenseful. Ranks nearly right up there with the best of them, but falls short in two aspects which I found to be grating:<br /><br />One is the occasional tendency lovingly to dwell upon irrelevant detail. I tended to skim over such passages, with no damage incurred, however, to my high level of interest in the plot.<br /><br />Another is the storyline's blind eye to the technical aspects of Juliette's amateurish dive into some hundreds of feet of water, which she performs during one of her adventures.  Doing it in real life in the way described would surely have killed her, either on the descent due to water pressure (about 10 times atmospheric, at the depth to which she went), or during her helter-skelter ascent, due to severe decompression. A technically savvy author like Robert Heinlein or Isaac Asimov, both revered Olympians of science fiction, would have covered such aspects.<br /><br />I found myself skimming through sizeable chunks of that dive episode, so little did they seem to be credible.<br /><br />Overall this is a commendable effort, written by a sympathetic and competent author who, it would seem, has not yet reached his full potential. I will keep right on following.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a perfectly made movie. The actors are terrific and the plot is original!
B005USZML4|5.0|Typically good Grisham.<br />first time i'd ever seen him do something that  had to do with a character  that wasn't a lawyer--except for maybe that baseball player book.
B0002KZAKS|3.0|Looks well made and has heft to it and the blue color is groovy, unfortunately mine was defective.  Does not have an on and off switch.  Sent it back for refund.  Comes with a case.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is the only alarm I use anymore. It has so many options. Adjustable snoozes. The volume can be set to come on gradually so that I don't get startled awake. It's so customizable, that you can make it exactly what you need it to be. I also love the countdown timer on it. I use that all the time also. One of my most used apps.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Friends said to try reading all three. I had a hard time putting them down. Darn job kept getting in the way of my reading time. It was good.
055357342X|3.0|I found this book to be really frustrating, as I have the previous two books of this series. While the story and characters are compelling and the world Martin creates is one I enjoy spending time in, the achilles heel of this series is the organization of the narrative. It took me over a year to read this book because I kept putting it down.<br /><br />After almost every chapter there was a huge let down because Martin takes you right to the point of something very interesting and compelling at the end of nearly every chapter, some event or plot development, only to leave the moment and shift to another character, another series of events that you haven't even been exposed to for dozens, if not hundreds of pages, forcing you to then ramp back up to speed. It's a daunting, tiresome organizational strategy that had me wanting to throw my Kindle against the wall after every chapter.<br /><br />Only in the last eighth of the book does he discover that he can weave the character narratives together and let one play off the other, thereby allowing the reader some sense of flow. But it was too little too late to save this from being another installment in a compelling story that was incredibly aggravating to read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|hay is a really good app try it and u will love it u can but your own song to wake u up and u can change the min really good app try it
1451695195|4.0|I've read other accounts and spoken to others that have had nd experiences.  This one is very far from the others.  In addition it had a hard time holding my attention.  I am sorry that Dr. Alexander had such a horrible time.  I pray that the Savior will continue to work on him.
B00493SIIA|5.0|I know this book is outdated, but it is a gem. Who knew that most millionaires in the U.S. are self employed? Or, that you can make $50-$60k per year and retire a millionaire (I suppose inflation may change those numbers slightly). I learned a lot about making mature financial decisions, and raising your family to be responsible, from this book. It will stay on my shelf and be read often!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I love the different filters that this offers. I've made some wonderful photos of my house and my dog with it. Even without taking and saving anything, it can be lots of fun to just see the world in a different way.
081299471X|5.0|This book is well written. I remember picking this book up and not wanting to put it down after I first got it. If you are up for a read that will get you thinking as the imagery passes by this book is for you.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't have too many apps on my Fire and I love this game.  However, two times now it has frozen and crashed because the Fire was updating some app in the background and I have lost everything and had to start over.  It just happened for the second time and I'm really unhappy, weeks of building houses and mines and crops and stuff all gone. sigh.

B008Z9L94O|5.0|Brings back lots of memories. I remember laying back at night listening through these albums. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness helped me get through some really tough and strange times. It was fun flipping through the large lyric and art book.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Good graphics. Felt a little short.the puzzles could have been more of a challenge. But overall a good game. .

B004DK5CW4|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!  I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER SECRETARIAT AND THE RACES (INCLUDING THE TRIPLE CROWN) THAT HE WON.  HE WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME HORSE AND THIS MOVIE IS FABULOUS!!!!!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is the best sudoku app I've found. I love Sudoku. It helps keep my mind active and can be challenging at times. This has many varieties and types of Sudoku. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good mental challenge.
B005LAIIPS|2.0|It does not has enough action, follow to story, and connection. The them left wondering if he was better than Bourne at the end. Does not like it.
125000568X|5.0|I'm a huuugeeee queen fan! This book is my dream come true! Tons of cool stuff hidden all throughout and LOADS of great information, if you're looking for a book on queen and you are a big fan this is the best choice! It even comes with a few posters that are awesomee!!

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!  I WISH THE COVER NAMED THE HORSE WHO PLAYED JOEY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT!!!
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I use the Widget  on this all the time. I love how it changes for my location, and makes it so simple to pull up an extended forecast for when I'm out of town. It's very simple.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|The Truman Show is a must watch movie. It is not a typical Jim Carrey goofy movie, but one that is quite emotional. It is very unique.<br />My experience with this through Amazon Digital was decent. There were a few times during the movie where there was a slight pause for buffering (I guess). Other than that, the quality was good.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I really liked the first Cut the Rope game.  This is just more of the same.  The levels could be a little harder though.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|When I heard that Mr. Fagen was releasing a new cd in October, I was very surprised.  First because there was 10 years between \\"Nightfly\\" and \\"Karmakirad,\\" and almost 15 years between \\"Karmakirad\\" and \\"Morph the Cat,\\" and second I always say his first three albums as a \\"trilogy\\" of sorts between past, present and future. I guess I wasn't sure how Condos would fit into that.<br /><br />Donald Fagen is a mastermind in the studio going back to his Steely Dan Days.\\"Sunken Condos\\" keeps that same high-level production value. The album itself takes on a decidedly more jazz feel, although I noticed that each song really stands on its own on this album. \\"Miss Marlene\\" is a standout for me, one of the most clever songs I have ever heard. I mean who else besides DF can write a song about a bowler and evoke that kind of response?<br /><br />All in all DF is a top-caliber performer and writer. Anything he puts out is gold, and this album, in my opinion, tops even Morph and Karmakirad.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read everyday. I have a list of the top 100 Novels of all time and the top 100 Science Fiction Novels of all time and I am working my way through them. With the exception of a handful of novels, this book is written better, original, creative and emotionally engaging than all of them. Amazing combination of post-apocalyptic fiction and science fiction that should appeal to everyone.

B006BXTOFC|5.0|Lots of people say that this doesn't measure up to their past work, but it does and it stands alone among other musician's efforts in this day and age. Solid and driving, El Camino is a must for anyone that appreciates current alternative or classic rock.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Got my wife this for xmas she is going to love it , I cant wait to give it to her for xmas
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|The book is perfect for small business realities, for the lessons it give in how to manage using less resources and doing less.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|The characters were not at all engaging, and somehow a story about Abraham Lincoln killing vampires to avenge the death of his mother is not at all compelling.
B002LB13SE|4.0|I'm not going to go into how disturbing this movie is or the quality of the acting.  I'm going to express how enjoyable it was to watch.  I'd been wanting to view it ever since I saw the original about a year ago and I am happy that I did.  The characters were strong enough, the gore was just enough and the entire thing flowed well.  There were a couple times it was a bit too dramatically drawn out, but it wasn't as bad as some movies that do that a lot.  I enjoyed the movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is another excellent read.  My wife and I could hardly wait for this book.  The continuing adventures of our fictional American hero.  We could use a few dozen heros like Mitch Rapp.  Until they come along in real life we will continue to look forward to the next book by Vince Flynn.  Thank you.
B000005DQR|3.0|Somehow I had never heard this album until I picked it up recently.  I'm a fan of DJ Shadow's other work, so I had high hopes.<br /><br />Regardless of genre or sub-genre, producing sample-based music is truly an art form, and here I feel Shadow is... good.  Many other reviews push the fact that Endtroducing was originally released in 1996, and suggest that it was somehow a groundbreaking effort, but I just can't see it.  By 1992, NWA and Public Enemy (putting aside the vocals) were producing some really inspired and engaging mixes, that sounded great, and by 1996 we see excellent work from Kruder & Dorfmeister, LTJ Bukem, and even Aphex Twin.  I would argue that this album lands somewhere on the same spectrum, and unless I misread something and it was actually released in 1986, it doesn't seem particularly novel for its time.<br /><br />Putting my mastering engineer hat on, there really isn't much bass, even factoring in the argument that this is more atmospheric music and not intended to be foundation-crumbling drum&bass or chassis-rattling hip-hop.  It sounds like a low cut filter was left in by accident, or like it was produced and mastered in the early 80s.  While I am usually at odds with people who focus on the sound of the music more than the music itself, it would probably be more enjoyable if it sounded better.<br /><br />Ultimately, what moves you moves you, and I was definitely moved by \\"What does your soul look like (pt 4),\\" but not much else.  I would like to like it more, so hopefully it will grow on me over time, at which point I'll gladly renounce this review.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read this in a short time and enjoyed it very much.  It ended the series in very good stead.  Great read.
0307887448|4.0|So I just finished reading Ready Player One and I have to say; I really liked it!!!<br /><br />It was pretty evident from the first few pages that I was going to enjoy this book. How can you go wrong with a slogan like The Matrix meets Alice In Wonderland???<br />For me, you cant.<br /><br />Anyways, I really enjoyed all the fun that was packed into this one. The plot kept moving at an entertaining speed and any time they slowed down to build some character, I really found myself interested in learning about their backgrounds.<br /><br />The story is well rounded giving just the right amount of action, emotion, and characterization.<br /><br />You could tell that Ernest Cline (the author) was really having fun going back to all of his fond memories of the 80s.<br /><br />I definitely suggest giving the book a try.<br /><br />If you're anything like me, you won't be able to stop reading until you've reached the very end.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />-Dylan

0547884591|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Tim's since 4HWW blew my mind. The 4 hr chef is, not only a great read, but also packed with great information on how to become a much better cook as well as a much better anything-else-you-wanna-be.<br />So whatcha gonna write about next?!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Such an amazing show with awesome acting and great character development. The plot is smart and enticing. You really feel for the characters.
0375869026|5.0|I challenge anyone to read 'Wonder' and not be moved to tears by not only the subject matter but the sensitive way the author has presented it. Ms. Palacio has inventively given us the story of Auggie Pullman as told from varying perspectives. The end result is a wonderful story about a sheltered child born with severe facial deformities; his parents have opted to home-school him as opposed to letting him attend school with his peers. At the onset of 'Wonder' Auggie's parents are wrestling with the idea of enrolling him in middle school at Beecher Prep. Auggie's mom believes this leap of faith will grow Auggie's world. His father compares the idea to 'leading a lamb to the slaughter.'<br /><br />The first months aren't exactly that bad, but bad enough to discourage even the most durable of spirits as students recoil and react to Auggie's appearance. But that's what Auggie is blessed with: a strong, durable spirit as well as a keen sense of reality and a quiet humor about himself that slowly draws his peers into his universe. His story is touchingly picked up by those who enter his orbit: his sister, his sister's boyfriend who considers that 'the universe takes care of all its birds' as well as several others who help shape Auggie's life.<br /><br />The author accurately depicts 'tweens at their very worst and their very best and shows that compassion and kindness may be inborn but these traits can be learned and modeled. The book should be a required read.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I rated this so High because I like the movie and I got the order quickly and with no problem.  But . . . . . I ordered this thinking I was getting the new version with the hours of extended stuff and hours of how they made the movie.  It was not.  So I sent it back (thinking that Ok I spent  $40 something dollars for this and I should get close to $40 something dollars back)  I do understand restocking and other stuff, but . . . . .  I go $12 back.  Really, come on really.  On the receipt I got back , there was a fee for this and a fee for that, and oh by the way another fee for this other thing, and so on....  Bottom line, they have good service and you can get almost anything, but you better make sure what you are ordering is what you want.

1594744769|4.0|Finally finished this one and it wasn't because it wasn't worth reading. I really liked it. Jacob grows up listening to the tales from his grandfather about these peculiar children. He makes the journey from Florida to an island off the coast of Wales.<br /><br />There he discovers the peculiar children. A group who have extraordinary powers and a few stories of their own.<br /><br />This is a YA, but really has a lot of delights for any reader.
1589944607|5.0|I have played over 30 games of Battlestar Galactica in the last 6 months, and it is currently my favourite board game. Of the 20+ people I have played with, most have warmed to its intricacies and unique gameplay. Some, however, have intensely disliked it. Here are a few reasons why you may not want to purchase this game:<br /><br />1) You haven't got 3 hours to spend on a single gaming session. Battlestar is (fairly) long and involving. You cannot simply stop the game and pick up where you left off another day. Your game time will, however, decrease with experience. With other experienced players, we can currently play through an entire game in under 2 hours.<br /><br />2) You dislike co-operative games with traitor mechanics. The traitor mechanic is the meat of Battlestar Galactica. If you're not sold on this point, then this game is simply not for you.<br /><br />3) You do not like 'lying'. Some people I have played with have been repelled by the fact that they have to 'lie' to their fellow players. If you cannot appreciate that this is necessary only in the context of a board game and in no way reflects your 'true self', then you should pass.<br /><br />4) You aren't partial to games more complex than Monopoly or Life. Battlestar Galactica's rules are fairly straightforward, but it may take a couple of read-throughs in order to grasp all of their subtleties. It is definitely more rule-heavy than the average family board game you may have played before.<br /><br />5) You dislike losing or playing games that are difficult to win. Frankly, you're unlikely to win as the Colonials before your 10th game. If you somehow DO win, it's probably because you misinterpreted/misapplied some crucial rule(s) that would otherwise have obliviated the Fleet. Far from being unbalanced, this is a game that rewards experimentation. There are enough variables to take into account that you are unlikely to hit upon a winning formula in your first few games.<br /><br />6) You prefer Eurogames that have little or no luck. Battlestar Galactica has card drawing and dice-rolling a-plenty. In my opinon, it sits comfortably somewhere between 'blind luck' and 'pure strategy'. It is an atmospheric game, after all.<br /><br />7) You haven't got 3 or 4 reliable gamer buddies. While playable at 3 or 4, Battlestar really shines at 5 or 6.<br /><br />8) You are afraid that you will want to play little else. This fear is only too well-founded, alas.<br /><br />I'll add more as I think of them.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think it's a great app because you post your pictures and get more friends<br />it's a great app you all should all download it

B008WCP2PG|5.0|I ordered Magic Mike just to watch the dance scenes over and over again. The movie's plot really isn't that great, but the cast makes up for it.
0525478817|5.0|I am a big fan of the vlog brothers so I bought this book regardless of if it was good or not but it actually is really good. It's gotten great reviews just look it up.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Loved Hugh as an actor...even more as a musician/actor!  Heartfelt blues with many  famous accompaniments ! What a fun & heartfelt tribute to blues as well as New orleans! Great job Hugh Laurie! Hope to hear more!
0525958002|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I was a diehard fan for years. I discovered them in 1982 when I was 11 years old. JT and D2 filled my ears, my walls, my locker. To say I was obsessed would be an understatement.  John Taylor was IT!!!<br /><br />I just found out about this book and bought it for my Kindle immediately.  As a long time fan, I was disappointed.  The first section of the book gave me hope, but shortly into the second part, I realized it was going downhill fast. I appreciate his intent, wanting to shield his bandmates, ex-girlfriends/wife, etc. from harsh scrutiny. But you can still tell a good story without divulging every private moment.  Maybe writing this book was part of his 9th Step work so he felt the need to protect these people, by doing no more damage. But I walked away from this book wondering exactly what the point of it was, other than a mild attempt at exercising some of his demons.<br /><br />Another reviewer said it felt like a Cliff's Notes version of his life. I agree completely. The second and third sections of the book feel like an afterthought, or like his deadline was up and he had to write fast. There are so many things left out, unsaid or glossed over. Some of which has been talked about in past interviews or articles, so why not touch upon them?  Expand upon those stories that are already out there to give the reader a clearer picture.  I wish the last two thirds of the book were as detailed as the first part. It almost felt like he checked out and a ghost writer took over.<br /><br />I wanted to hear more about his relationships within the band. He's been photographed with Simon's family for years.  I would assume they are close, but he doesn't elaborate. And Nick, his oldest friend, what about him?  This was the biggest flaw of the book, left me going WTH!  Do you even know these guys???<br /><br />Also, to exclude Andy from his list of acknowledgements felt very passive-aggressive. Maybe he can bring that up in therapy LOL!  But seriously, while we'll never know the details behind the end of that relationship (because JT chose to keep that another secret), they were bandmates and friends during the height of their creativity and fame. Andy was never my favorite, but there would be no D2 without him. His sound helped make that band what it was. It really felt like a slap in the face to not thank him. And that's really my last impression of this book which is ironic.  With all of JT's good intentions to not write a gossipy tell all, it felt mean spirited in the end.<br /><br />Can I recommend this book?  Only if you go in with no expectations (yes I've acquired a new resentment) or know very little about JT or the band.  It's a quick, easy read for a flight or lounging poolside.  He name drops a bit, you get a few fun stories about Sting and Andy Warhol. But I cannot recommend this for Duranies. It will leave you with a million unanswered questions, wondering what happened to the rest of the book.<br /><br />One last complaint. The pictures throughout the book have no description attached. Not sure if this is just on the Kindle, maybe the hardcover is different. I really wanted to know who some of those people were.  I'm hoping this was an oversight and gets corrected.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|The realism when it comes to the actual art of marksmanship is very well portrayed in this film. The story line is a common fall guy takes revenge against the man but it is well presented. The characters are believable for the most part even though some of the action is a bit over the top. all in all a very good movie for those avid marksmen out there as the realism of shooting is very well portrayed in this film.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises was a great movie that I've seen this year and a great ending to the final batman film
0316044695|5.0|All Americans should read this book to help understand the sacrifices paid by veterans in general and especially the 0.45% of people who have actually gone into combat for the rest of America since 9-11-01.

B009B8YZKS|5.0|I don't even play Halo and I want them to do more episodes. I loved it. I was expecting it to be some cheezy cheap production. The acting and special effects were way better than I was expecting. I watched all the episodes straight in a row. I thought I was going to watch the first one and move on to something else. Nope.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Honestly other than me opening the box that the DVD set came in that's all I can judge by so far.... I got this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and so far everything looks great but of corse I can't open the package get so I guess we'll have to see but I did love that I got all 8 DVDs for a great price
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love that Android lets you pick you're own keyboard. (one reason iPhone sucks is that you're locked into the plain, lame stock keyboard). This is the best 3rd party keyboard I've found out there. It has lots of customization and runs super smooth on my GS3 (it did on my Thunderbolt and Droid Charge previously too). One of my favorite features is it lets you choose the length for longpress sub-characters! So I can turn it down to 200 milliseconds so I barely have to hold down the top row of letters to get the numbers. Great app. Worth the money for the full version.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it brings back such good memories... I used to watch that show like it was a religion..  Saturday morning cartoons with a bowl of cereal. sitting on the floor right in front of the telivision.
0525953728|5.0|A good read from a guy who has BTDT and not simply &#34;punched his card&#34; to get ahead in his career. It brings things down to a level that even non-military types will enjoy, doesn't seem to embellish the life, and gives a realistic look at  a special operator's life.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|One of my all time favorites!  The acting and directing doesn't get much better than this, and its no wonder it won Academy Awards!
B005PM3YII|4.0|Characters leap out of the page they are so real and most believable and spooky background make this a difficult book to put down
B007FC3AAI|5.0|This DVD I got for myself... Obviously I hav a collection of the saga going on now I only need the very first twilight and the very last one that just came out in theaters... But as for this product.. I love it... The DVD is in perfect working condition and looked great for it in a tidy man or and my boyfriend hates me watching it as much S I love watching it

0345803485|1.0|I think it was a funny book. If you want a good laugh, grab 50 shades. Or better yet, do a drinking game with how many times Ana rolls her eyes or bites her lips, or says 'oh my'. Another good one for when someone cocks their head to one side and murmurs all at the same time. I suggest not using hard liquor when playing the game because YOU WILL GET INTOXICATED! Try doing it with Twinings English Breakfast tea. OH MY GOD! This book put me to sleep. The guy is a NUT JOB. He isn't sexy at all. WTF! How are all these women getting all excited about him?? He is a perfect description of a wife beater. Wow...if this is how the women of this country get off then I'm speechless. Terrible writing too by the way...REPETITIVE. I think the books I read in middle school were better written than this. I won't even mention the British lingo...I can't believe a married woman with children can write such crap. AND WHO COMES AT THE DROP OF A HAT?! WHAT?! Worst book EVER.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game provides many challenges and requires strategy to complete each challenge to make it to the next. I would recommend this game to others. I really like the different scenes of each seasons. Enjoy!
B00A6N8YTU|5.0|I went into this movie not expecting much of anything. At the start of the movie, you're presented with a rather slow dull start so you'll have to give it a good 30-45 mins before any real action starts. Once things heated up, the movie pulled me in and I was extremely entertained.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Well, really did'nt get a chance to watch all the way thru.  Just saw some previews.  But will finish watching.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked it BUT seriously.... I cannot imagine anyone putting up with this controlling, jealous, insecure behavior.  Money certainly cannot buy happiness apparently.  Def. erotic.  These two were made for each other.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Completely captivating, sucks you in...you don't want to put it down.  With surprises all along the way. I would have liked a different ending, but that is just the &#34;happily ever after&#34; girl in me.
1579128149|5.0|My son loves it. great science book, and it contains trivia about the elements and makes them come alive for him
0547884591|5.0|First off this is just a beautiful book in general. Makes a brilliant coffee table book, and contains hundreds of color pictures. That being said, i thoroughly enjoyed the contents of the book as well. The first impression is \\"Holy Sh*t\\" this is a lot of information, but that's one of the book's best qualities.  People need to understand first and foremost that this is a book about rapid learning. NOT a cook book. The vehicle that he uses to describe the process of this \\"meta-learning\\" is cooking. I did learn a lot about proper cooking technique, and also a bunch of other interesting methods for learning things quickly. People who are leaving this book bad reviews are either A) people who got the wrong impression and thought this was a cook book, B) People who thought that just buying this book and not actually reading it or working hard was going to make them magically better at things, or C) people that are jealous of Tim's ambition and success rate, or think that hes a con. If you truly sit down and read this book and put these principles to use in your everyday life, it is impossible to not come away a better person after reading this book...
B004PGO25O|5.0|Steven Pressfield has a lot to say about just getting your creative work, whatever it may be, done. This book will help you to deal with the demons and disappointments and your everyday life as well, as you carve out the necessary time for your creativity. Heartily recommended, along with his &#34;War of Art.&#34;

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I agree with the detailed review saying the map and journal were nice features. I'm not great at these adventure but I was able to get most of the clues and artifacts without hints.<br /><br />Graphics are nice and the change of season changing what you can find is a really nice touch.<br /><br />I'll be buying more games from Fire Maple. This is the first faotd in a long time to catch my eye.<br /><br />Runs great on kindle fire.
1932907009|5.0|Though I'm not a screen writer but a novelist, the late Blake Snyder's blunt and humorous take on what's required to create a saleable work of fiction is a real eye-opener. While using his &#34;Beat Sheet,&#34; a description of how the parts of a plot work together and where within a ms. they should fall, I began to understand the how and why of plotting, which had escaped me for the two years I'd studied it. Have I sold a ms. yet? Too early, haven't completed the one I was working on when I stumbled into the book at the public library and decided I needed a copy of my own. But that's the kick. If your library has it, check it out, and I'll bet you end up buying your own copy.
B005LHOKFS|2.0|Isn't organized to be helpful in any real way. Google maps is better to just show what's in the area you plan to be in to figure out how to map out a trip - or road trip anyway.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I like this game but it needs an update the iphone has all the cool stuff this is taking too long. PLEAS update this
B00005O4V2|5.0|Johnny Depp is THE total package. He is an acting GOD that can tackle any, and i mean any role that you throw at him. He is smart, articulate and humorous. And he is amazingly good-looking. It doesnt get much better than that. He was excellent in this movie. I think this role and his Donnie Brosco role were his two best career roles. Why this man doesnt have a mantel full of Oscars is a crime. LOVE YOU JOHNNY!! :-D
B0084BMUFA|5.0|In my personal oppinion, this story of Christmas is one of if not the best outside of the biblical story. It not only evokes the true sense of what Christmas should be about, but uses the message out of scriptures to empasize it beautifully. I will make it a tradition from now on to read this story every year to remind myself what this season is all about, Him and the love He has shown us.
B00475AUWW|5.0|If you have the urge to write, or paint, or sculpt, or do any of the dozens of other creative things creative people do, but just can't seem to find the time, meet your new best friend. Steven Pressfield will talk you down from the ledge, out of the window, away from the sharp knife. If you are a creative person, whatever form that creativity may take, you need this book.
B00333NCTM|5.0|I love Ozzy!  Parts of this book are hilarious, parts of it are sad...it's honest and it's Ozzy.  Do not hesitate to buy this book!  It's an awesome read...I couldn't stop reading it.
1401922732|5.0|I originally bought these in a conscious bookstore I let my sister use them and she had to have her own deck has answered alot of  questions for me and brought me peace I hope it does the same for you!  GOD BLESS!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I never really saw the appeal of Angry birds, until now.  This is perfect for the Star Wars nerd, how can anyone resist Obi Wan birds that can use the force, Han Solo blaster birds?  Even better, Darth Vader laughs mockingly if you fail a level.  Each section just keeps getting better and better.  Worth every penny.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|I Enjoyed this one especially the fact that most of the story was set in Sydney Australia. I have read most of the Harry Hole series and have enjoyed them all
B0037NB6QE|5.0|i really love this series! Every once in awhile you need to just sit, read and escape from the real world. And this book does just that. Now onto the next book in the series! A Good Yarn!
B001GJ7E9E|5.0|This is a great sit back and laugh movie with action and comedy through the entire movie till the very end loved it!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I really enjoyed the conclusion  to this trilogy. Was a bit sceptical when I started reading but found the books had a bit of everything for some light reading
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would highly recommend this book!  It is spiritually uplifting and very easy to read. Author did a fabulous job describing his experience!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love this show. It had been years since I followed a show religiously, but I never miss an episode (thank goodness for DVR!)...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|great when i am in a hot spot - don't use it often, but it is nice to have when unsure of the weather.
B002PNF8HK|5.0|I saw this movie before I bought it about a year ago and enjoyed it so much I had to own it.  It is a great thriller and mother daughter story.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|This series was incredible.  Although it was cancelled way too soon, it has somehow withstood the test of time.  After ten years, I am still captivated every time I watch it.
B00A993UWM|5.0|this album is fantastic. ke$ha has done it again! it gets me pumped up and has a great vibe. love it!
B000PHX8C0|5.0|Been listening to Dez since he was in Coal Chamber. Nice to see the metal guys listened to in high school actual mature as a musician. Doesn't happen all the time. Love it!
1451637500|5.0|PhoenixFalls was very correct with the analysis, but I think there's one more point to add. LMB's books are about people; people with well developed personalities, joy and grief, regrets for actions taken or not taken, pride in accomplishments, and pain in failure.  People who are not perfect, who have love, but also have warts.  Her characters are developed with sensitivity and humor... lots of humor.  I read all of her books because of that sensitivity and humor.  Other authors will give me the science and action/adventure, but very few will give me characters I can relate to, understand, and admire.<br /><br />Yes, Cryoburn could be read as a stand-alone book, and be enjoyed as such.  It's not the most adventurous book in Miles' series. In fact, in many ways it reminds me of an Agatha Christy novel. In it, you see Miles continued growth and maturity, even as the rest of us grow and mature over time.<br /><br />Gregor's part in the Aftermath, however, makes the whole book worth reading and rereading to me, although you have to read all the books to truly understand the depth of the relationship between Gregor and Count Arel Vorkosigan in order to get the full impact.  It leaves me in tears every time, not only because of the unstated but implied love between the two, but because it strikes a cord in me.  I was denied the chance to honor my father by carrying him to his final rest, and I never realized how important it was until I read this drabble.  How many authors can make you think and laugh and cry in the same book?
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game, great mind exercise. My 7 yo and 4 yo both play too! Daily bedtime game for me.
193609648X|5.0|So why the stars? it's an idea book, a thoughtful book. I design a lot of my Crocheted items and this book brings my head into a place where there are possibilities I never thought of before. The items are dazzling, as the cover says and do-able by your average crochet buff. The written instructions come with the schematics and that is number one for me. I vastly prefer the diagrams.<br /><br />The only beef I have is the Lacey Capelet on page 78 is either ill-fitting, or poorly blocked. I believe this pattern has potential, but perhaps not in this yarn choice. I do use some Noro yarn, but not often. I love their designs, but not always the yarn. It can be scratchy. That's an opinion and I urge you to make a small project and see for yourself.<br /><br />I made a version of the Bobbled Hat, but with far fewer bobbles, this is one of the reasons I don't follow patterns to a T. I loved the colors, the feel of the hat, but there was so much going on, that you could not appreciate the stitches. Most of the items are very approachable and there is not a lot of food for the very experienced crochet enthusiast, but most crochet books lack in this area. I would purchase this for the advanced beginner to intermediate enthusiast who wants to work with good yarn, on reachable projects.<br /><br />For newer crocheters there is the, Strawberry Lace Scarf, Bobbled Mitts, Swirl Tam (needs more thought), and Shell Scarf, to name a few. Overall this lovely book looks best right where everyone can see it and you in a creation that is made from it, or adapted from it. Do not be afraid to change yarns, as long as they are the same weight and have fun. I think this is a very fun idea book and wonderful to have in actual paper. I love my Kindle Fire, but some books were meant for a hardcover and paper.
B007MDB548|5.0|excellent picture and very clear. My kid love it very much. all three discs are included + digital copy for your mobil device

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. So easy to use. I check it first thing every morning before I head out on the way to work - especially useful for wind direction. I have multiple locations set up too which is nice. Hourly forecast is good too.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I found the Secret Keeper fascinating.  I could not put it down.  I did have to go back to earlier chapters at times to spark my memory when someone was mentioned or an event. I enjoyed this book
B0058W74UY|1.0|not compatible with kindle fire, certain web pages require a flash program so i downladed this one and it did not work. so i deleted it.
B008PUXMP2|4.0|Regret waiting to purchase but glad to have the collection now.  Such a loss of a free spirit and great storyteller.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I got this app for me and loved it then my 4 yr old son played it and he loved it as well
B002PEP4U0|5.0|This was a request of my book club---it was appreciated and valued, it arrived at my house quickly and I told my members how efficient Amazon was with this book!!!
1609613937|5.0|This is the best book. If you need to lose weight this really works and is so simple. My Doctor suggested a low carb diet for me and it took me 2 months to lose 8 lbs and it was so much work to keep track of how many carbs I ate everyday. With t he starch solution I lost 12lbs in a month and all I did was cook and eat!
0802473156|4.0|Being married for 40 years, I was surprised to learn of my spouse's responses compared to how I thought he would answer.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Many free puzzles. Beautiful high definition graphics.  Hours of quality entertainment.  Many levels of difficulty.  I highly recommend this app.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Dice with Buddies is a fun game & has an added bonus that friends can play and chat all at the same time!
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Hilarious!  This is one of the best movies to watch around Halloween.  No problems with shipping, it arrived very quickly.
B005LAIHGI|3.0|I found some of the comedy a bit off but all in all it was okay and will remain a part of my collection.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|War Horse has become my new BEST MOVIE ever.  As a true horse person, I loved the history & realism portrayed.  Have recommended many times & have given as a gift.  Loved it!
B001E45XT4|5.0|These headphones are amazing, I have bought dozens of different expensive headphones that always end up breaking shortly after purchase, these have withstood the test of time and when they finaly break I know exactly where to go to get more.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Very informative and useful. You can use it to find pretty much any useful information that is needed at any time.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|Very hard to get used to John Corey's, often out of place, wise cracks.  I suppose an NYPD cop would use crude language and harbor a cynical attitude.  Not my kind of hero, preferJack Reacher or Myron Boliter. Alternatiuvely I am enjoying &#34;The Leoperd:.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|Dr. Seuss; all of the Dr. Seuss tales have a moral lesson I wish these types of movies got a bigger market share and that more children could watch them.
B0086700CM|5.0|Had tried this on another device so kind of knew a little how to play.  It is very addictive & absolutely lots of fun.  I try & beat my grand kids at playing this.  It takes good concentration to be good at it but is much fun!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can read it fast enough and at the same time slow enough to savor every moment.<br />The previous book was a lot of work because it introduced so many new characters, but this book ties it all together with all the familiar characters from the past and continues with this fascinating journey.
B008RTE08E|5.0|I aquired this re issue of the Beatles Magical Mystery Tour. A lot of people thought it was a flop, but I think  it is an entertaining piece of film. I think it is a little Fellini esque with the spotlight on all the ecentric characters within the film. It is not any less pompous than the revered Monkee TV shows. This release has an enhanced visual quality and features extra stories and insights into the making of the film. True Beatle fans will like it. Those younger viewers honed on action films will find it less than exhilerating.
B0081BU42O|5.0|It's very amusing to read Bank's concept of how giant future spaceships communicate amongst themselves like characters in a Monty Python skit.  I love his vision of the far future and I like his ability to weave an exciting adventure with humor as well as thrills and chills.  The occasional extreme violence snaps like a whip.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|A disturbing trip through the bizarre world of an aspiring dancer.  If you are into the depressing aspects of art, this movie is for you.
B004R63MWQ|2.0|Supposed to be 3D. NOT! If you are looking to find a movie to play on your new 3D TV, this ain't it!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This story deserves to win awards and be widely published and read. Follow astronaut Mark Watney as he is stranded on Mars and endeavours to survive. Written with lots of humour and tension ... and great characters.<br /><br />It is now in my Top 5 all-time list of science fiction books, and easily the most engrossing novel of any kind I've read in ages. I couldn't put it down, a true page turner. I hope Andy Weir is encouraged by the growing feedback to write more hard science fiction, his prose explains a lot of hard stuff simply enough for a layman to follow and keep pace. I also hope the story is adapted for a movie or TV series ... perhaps Elon Musk of SpaceX could be the producer.<br /><br />EDIT: (a few years later.) In 2014 the story is now widely published, Andy Weir is writing fulltime and Ridley Scott is directing Matt Damon as Watney due for release in November 2015. An Oscar-winning performance from Damon will do more for NASA Human Space Flight than anything since Apollo.
1594135851|4.0|I orderd the first book earlier and got hook on Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games books.  This one isn't as exciting as the first but quite good.
B001H1SVO8|2.0|This cult fav seems to appeal to the outsider and the peculiar.  Violent , unsettling, repulsive and filled with gaps in logic.  Normal folks need not apply.
B00511PTWM|1.0|This is not a quality product and severely over-priced for the value.  The first one broke immediately.  I plan on returning its replacement.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|First off, there is a lot of disturbing content and imagery in this movie that is definitely not appropriate for kids - or adolescents - and won't be appreciated by all viewers.<br /><br />That being said, I loved it.  I tore through the book in 2 days straight (read through the night one night and most of the next, and my husband was not happy), but still really enjoyed the movie.  The choice of actors was superb, and really, the whole thing was very well done.  I absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of thing.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It provides much greater detail than the movie.  It has some surprises such as where did the Tin Man come from.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I have to agree with someone that said the author sometimes sounds a little bit arrogant about her academic achievements, but despite this trait, the book is perfect. Even when she talks about her dogs (and she does that a lot) it just adds more spice to the book, and one can benefit from the precious tips she gives to handle your own dogs. I recommend this book vehemently to everyone who loves dogs and tries to understand them.
B005K17RU0|5.0|GREAT FOR TRAVELING PLANS! I LOVE THE EASE OF ADDING NEW LOCATIONS. I'M REALLY ENJOYING ALL THE FEATURES AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read...loved the story to the end...waiting for the new books to be released...kept my attention til the end....Sylvia Day is a great author
B0063IH60K|1.0|I don't like the comercial's comercials, comercials.<br />The gyrations I have to go thru to get back to the game are unacceptable.<br />The Kindel is VERY unforgiving<br />It stinks.<br />Mike sheppa
B00063EMJ6|4.0|I heard Neil Young played all over the dormitory when his albums were new, and so did not bother buying any of them myself.  Over the years, my appreciation for him and his style grew, and I recognize him as one of the greats of the time.  And yet I am not inclined to go out and buy everything he did, the way more dedicated fans would.<br /><br />This greatest hits collection brings together all of the songs I enjoyed most and found most distinctive from his early albums, and brings in a few later tracks too.  It also includes \\"[[ASIN:B002FVIC8E Helpless]]\\", which was written and performed by Neil Young but published on \\"[[ASIN:B002FVMARS Deja Vu]]\\" by Crosby Stills Nash & Young; you can hear CSN providing backup vocals and instruments.<br /><br />I had never heard this collection until a few weeks ago, when I was sitting at a sidewalk bar on Sukhumvit Soi 20 in Bangkok; they were playing it.  I was impressed with the selections and resolved over my beer to get a copy.<br /><br />This collection is perfect for a casual fan like me.  Four stars: \\"I Like It.\\"
1401235417|5.0|Lets first start off that I didn't read the comics before the relaunch so when I saw this in one hardcover volume I jumped on it. The book is great. The art is fantastic. When I finished the book I reflected on the story. The Court of Owls are very menacing. They are brutal and they leave Batman in a broken physical state in the last pages of  the book. Batman thought that Gotham was his city but when an assassin tries to kill Bruce he delves deeper into the nursery rhyme that he thought fake and they get inside his head and almost destroy him. You will want to to get more issues or wait till the 2nd volume comes out in March 2013. So all in all this was a great read. This is a great jumping in point for new readers like me and Batman fans who already read the comics!
B009VLX8FS|4.0|First, let me say I'm not in *anybody's* demographic.  I was in high school when President Kennedy was assassinated.  I served in the Air Force during the Vietnam war where I found my \\"military niche\\" as a disc jockey for the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service.  My rock and roll roots go way back and way deep.  My wife, on the other hand, is big on country and when I ride in her car the radio is tuned to WMZQ or XM/Sirius Highway 16.  As a result, I have also developed an appreciation of country music, as well.<br /><br />I have a lot of country music on my iPod, ostensibly purchased for my wife.  My recordings include Taylor Swifts albums \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Speak Now\\" and now \\"Red\\", which I purchased largely on the strength of \\"We Are Never Getting Back Together.\\"  I also own Katy Perry's \\"One Of The Boys\\" and \\"Teenage Dream.\\"  I have to confess that while I like both artists and most of their work, the bulk of \\"Red\\" sounds too much like Katy Perry and not enough like Taylor Swift.  That won't stop me from enjoying this new album but I think Taylor needs to go back to curls and country and leave rock and roll and punk hair to Katy.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|My Husband and I have seen the movies many times but they are even better on blue ray... the picture is much sharper.
B008KE3960|5.0|Fun little tower defense game with planes! Nice spin with moving \\"towers\\".  I couldn't put it down! Great graphics as well. Two thumbs up!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a fun game that just help to relax you and thats your mind away from all the stress of the day
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I prefer shopping directly from my Kindle. It has a better layout IMO.Only use it to read on my tablet when I don't have my e-reader.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|We have seen these movies many times but they are much better on blue-ray...the picture is much sharper and clearer.
0547884591|5.0|I guess I am one of Tim's 1000 True Fans..... but His 4 hour work week and 4 hour body helped me grow two businesses 300% in two years and lose 40 lbs in 6 weeks.  I bought 4 copies of his new book to give to friends, but now I wish I had kept the secret to myself.  After a week with the book I am cooking amazing meals for my family and having fun shopping for new foods.  If you love to learn new things and be entertained while reading what is essentially a college textbook for learning skills, this is the book for you.
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, and this DVD played it perfectly. So that was awesome. It's so good, guys. SO GOOD.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book is very good and fast developing. After the disaster that, in my opinion, was a Feast for Crows this was an excelent read. It is not so good as A Game of Thrones or a Storm of Swords. Nonetheless, here the characters do things you never expected, but that make total sense, as opposite of the previous one which was very predictable in my opinion.<br /><br />To sum up I think you will enjoy this book, although it will make you curse Martin for making you wait until his next book
B0083GQKQG|5.0|WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is easily one of the best films of 2011.  Every aspect of Ramsay's film is strong: The editing, both in sound and visual, is seamless and effective with the elliptical storyline.  The acting, especially that of Swinton and Miller, is compelling, thoughtful and intense.  Cinematography is beautiful and unique, with images that will continue to haunt you after the film has stopped.  Soundtrack is effective, sometimes jarring, and contributes well to the mood of the scenes.  Excellent, excellent film and highly recommended.  Prepare yourself for lots of post-watching thoughts and discussion.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Superb acting, insightful.  Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Dev Patel are wonderful.  Beautiful photography and lighting.  Charming locals featured are an added bonus.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Like others, i was originally going to just get TDKR on blu-ray but then noticed the complete set for only a few dollars more and pre-ordered this instead immediately. Now that i finally have it i am very satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />You get 5 discs:<br />1) Batman Begins (movies and special features)<br />2) The Dark Knight (just the movie)<br />3) The dark knight Special Features<br />4) The Dark knight Rises (just the movie)<br />5) The Dark Knight Rises Special features<br /><br />You also get a booklet of the art and making of The Dark Knight Trilogy, which is a nice little bonus.<br /><br />AND Ultraviolet digital downloads of ALL THREE MOVIES.<br /><br />Honestly, i couldnt ask for anything more from this. i dont even need the special features but for the price and all you get it is a great deal. its even a couple dollars less now so id definitely grab it while you can for that price.<br />I had the first two movies on DVD so this was a great upgrade to Blu-ray.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This book is excelent for those of you that are kids or that enjoy thinking as a kid. Its written in a way that makes you feel like a kid  and of course tries to teach you the real meaning of christmas.<br /><br />I would recommend it even to non christian readers because in some chapters makes you wonder about why we speak the way we do and you can extrapolate his lesson to be that every action has its consequences in others.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|Doreen Virtue is first off an amazing writer and human being. Secondly, she writes beautifully, but very easy to read. This is just a cute little book for anyone to read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I hope it will continue to be as much fun as it has been. I was a little bit disappointed when I found you had to buy hints and could not earn them. I hope I don't find I have to buy things to continue enjoying the game.
B007885IJU|5.0|This was a gift for my god daughter and she LOVED it. It's a must for any record music collection.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|A must read for any inspiring chef. It provides a simplified learning technique you can use in many aspects of life..
014132161X|4.0|Started reading this to my son who is 8 and my daughter who is 4 and we couldn't put it down. They begged for it. Acting it out, pretended to be the characters. The characters were humorous and relevant. This has been one of our favorite read alouds of the year. I honestly thought it would be difficult to get through with my children and their ages and the British dialect of the writer. It was not an issue at all, we really enjoyed this book and learning more about the author. Highly recommended.
B005LAII62|1.0|I bought this movie assuming it would be fun for a movie night with my three boys aged 7,4 and 2.  I was wrong.  From the inappropriate language to the gruesome scenes to a main character deciding to \\"come out of the closet\\" for added shock value.<br /><br />The cover said that it was \\"for the whole family\\".  Shame on the film makers for not having this film rated PG-13 and for trying to shove it on to young kids.<br /><br />I respect the gay right movement and have supported it 100%.  However, this was not added to the film to educate children or to add substance to the film, it was pure shock value.  And as a parent, I believe that I have the right to decide when I find it appropriate to sit down with my child (especially my 4 year old) and have this conversation with him.<br /><br />I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. I returned it and got my money back.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I thought the movie was good.  I felt it stayed close to the book.  I hope the next movies do the same.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|Hellboy is witty, full of adventure and has many interesting heroes and villains.  The price is right for this product.  The movie makes you want to see Hellboy 2  immediately.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|to me it was a love story, a fairy tale come true.  have read it twice, very hard to put down
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This book was given to me for free by Morgan Rice after signing up for emails on his website. First off this was a great book. It kept me interested and entertained and had some really great characters. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that sometimes there were sentences that were repeated. He would state something at the end of one paragraph and then start the next with almost the same sentence. I noticed this several times throughout the book. Can't wait for the next book in the series because of the way it ended! I would definitely recommend this book for someone looking for something a little different and not in the vampire genre like a couple of Morgans other series.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|We recently purchased 2 Samsung Galaxy S3 for Verizon from Amazon Wireless and we kept our phone numbers from T-mobile and transferred them to Verizon Wireless, and the entire purchase, including transferring our numbers was seamless, it took a little longer than anticipated to get our order however it wasn't anyone's fault, it was simply the Samsung Galaxy S3 phones are such a hot item everyone is having trouble keeping them in stock.<br /><br />We would definitely refer anyone to Amazon Wireless for their wireless purchases, they extremely efficient & super friendly!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Silly! Not my taste! Sorry,I ordered it. Had not read the forgoing books and did not really know what to expect.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|some details are alittle much. love story is good, can make you cry and smile at the same time.  read it twice
030759565X|4.0|I was intrigued by her interview on the radio prior to Thanksgiving . There she presented a wonderful recipe for broccoli, cranberry nut salad. So I went ahead and ordered. In following the recipe, I was doing very detailed work for about three hours. The recipe is wonderful and I want to explore the rest! It's a fresh view of food preparation which I think will be fun! You can't be looking for easy timely processes. For those loving food preparation, it's a treasure! Mary Alice Golsen
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|Nice to have a handy reference to the night sky. Simple to use, many options. Great graphics, good product, thanks.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|If you loved Schwarzenegger's role in the original version as I did, you will also love Farrell's performance in the new 2012 film.  At the end of the original version I had unanswered questions, but those questions were put to rest by the 2012 release.  I'm a fan of this type movie so it was high on my list as soon as I heard about it.  I have read some not so good reviews but I guess these guys just don't get it.  I highly recommend this movie for all science fiction buffs.
B0058YPILY|5.0|enjoyed all episodes.  season finale had a good ending.  don't like it when a main charater leaves.  could watch them 7 days a week
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This movie has everything an action fan wants,  and the fact it has all my favorite actors is like icing on the cake...
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|You can lose a loved one to untimely death without turning to drugs and sex.  If you set out on a grand adventure, at least learn about it and properly prepare for the unexpected.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|The bars are strong and the pads hold my 15 inch laptop in place as expected. Its never fallen off. I love the simple design and the aluminum build. I use this to prompt my computer next to a bigger screen. I no longer have to look down at the laptop screen because the viewing height matches my monitor's. Quality buy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the way book one ends you have to read book 2.  you put yourself in the characters place.  a fairytale comes true
B009AHWLHE|5.0|At first it is a little slow, but the suspense does build and the ending is great,  It surely added another chapter to the series.  And expands the field nicely.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a great game to teach children problem solving and how to prioritize actions from most important to likes.
1469984202|5.0|Good stuff, well written, deserves to be read.  Glad you have found such great success with what is a very well written novel.  People should read it.  Listen to the 2500 positive reviews and not the 19 people who txt all day with their thumbs and only understand books with pictures.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I love criminal minds.  good stories and relates to everyday life.  a story within the characaters too.  enjoyed all episodes.
B009JNXK88|5.0|I'm addicted. Got this game for free when it was the Amazon app of the day. I would have gladly paid for it. I saw many comparisons to the old Megaman series. I would agree with this comparison. It's a well developed app which has an incredible amount of depth considering the simplicity of the gameplay.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It is more challeging than regular solitaire but the game is to small. It is hard to use your fingers to move the right amount of cards. I hope I can enlarge the cards somehow.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Loved the Book and loved the movie. I watch it a lot and have recommended it  to many of my friends
B009B8YZKS|5.0|finally! Halo fans got a proper Halo film. Never thought that they could make chief look so good, in a live action film.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great Movie in General -- See in 3D Blu-Ray!  Well worth Buying - Ridley Scott and cast will give you your money's worth!  Shot in Native 3D -- the 3D Cinematography, CGI Landscapes and Effects support a great story line!  Best to view either close-up on a 3D monitor or on a big 3D screen to get the fullest immersion!  Enjoy!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Bring tissues for the end. Like her other books, this one has me thinking about it all the time. Highly recommended.
B007L5KT76|5.0|Saw the first, wanted to see the second. It was really good, although I did like the first better.  Found it cheaper in stores but I bought it through Instant Video
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is an awesome game I have it on the Pc and xbox Wich I think r better cause there is more stuff in them but overall this is really still great because it is on a device u can bring with u to other places
0547884591|4.0|Loved the book, loved the learning theories and ideas, loved the recipes, and I can't wait to smoke a turbaconator
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The series was great; and this first book gets you hooked! My son even read them. If you liked Harry Potter or if your kids were into the Percy Jackson series, you most likely will enjoy this too.
B0099114WO|5.0|this is a terrific movie, I had friends who had seen it, but I told them not to tell me about it. it is a great movie
0316228532|4.0|First off, know that I'm a hard core Harry Potter fan. This book was difficult to get into because, I think, I was having trouble dissociating it from Harry Potter. I think if you're going to try it, which you should, then go into it forgetting that J.K. Rowling wrote it. It is 100% different from Harry Potter. You've been warned, don't expect it to be.<br /><br />That being said, this book is for adults. Please don't buy this for your children, parents. It does touch on adult themes, in fact, its drowning in them. I thought it was difficult to read more than half of the book. I'm serious. I got to page 250 and thought, \\"well, this is disappointing.\\" But I stuck with it, which I recommend you do. I found it hard to connect and sympathize with any of the characters because I just did not like them.<br /><br />That all changes in the last 70 pages. I mean, I flew through them. i know it's not encouraging to think you've got to read 400 pages before a book gets good, but J.K. does something beautiful with this book.<br /><br />She's honest. I didn't like the characters, because of one simple fact: she really explores how every single person could be deemed horrible in their own way. Her characters were pathetic, horrible, self-absorbed, uncaring, and cowardly, but...so are all of we.<br /><br />No one is without faults. Sometimes we're ridiculous and cowards when the solution is simple. Sometimes we're neglectful and the consequences lead to disaster. The last pages really had my eyes open wide. I cried, I gasped, and I flipped pages like a mad woman, skipping over paragraphs to find out what happened and then going back, desperate to know why.<br /><br />Great literature does not just entertain, it make you reflect. You should be able to put a book down, but still walk around for hours thinking about what it just told you. I learned that I had traits found in my most hated character and that I'm only a little like my favorite. I saw my family. I saw honesty.<br /><br/>Really, please read it. Be a trooper and read through the first half. Just know it will get better. It was fantastic and well worth the build up. Harry Potter shaped my life and helped me discover what I wanted to do with my life. The Casual Vacancy made me remember who I wanted to be.<br /><br />Thank you, J.K. Rowling. You've done it again.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|It was stupid. He was half naked and that was great, but story plot sucked. The ending was beyond horrible. It disappointed me.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock app. Good features like playing music as an alarm and a fade in to the volume level make this a winner.
145470246X|4.0|I love the designs in this book. I am finding it a tiny bit difficult to source some of the materials. The written directions are sometimes difficult to follow, but an experienced beader should have no problem working them because of the detailed illustrations. If not for that I would have given it five stars.
1250027624|5.0|The Chronicles of Downton Abbey book is nicely illustrated with rich color pictures that transport you back to the time of jewels and finely made silk dresses.  Step into the dream.
B0044QMNV0|5.0|I got this book as a wedding present from my parents and it was a lifesaver more times than I can count.  It was even more helpful after I became a single parent.  My copy is waterlogged and much worn and I still love it.  Besides being useful, it's also an entertaining read.  Now my daughter is out on her own and a copy of this book is what she asked for (actually she asked for my copy).
B000OXHRRC|4.0|I loved this movie. It starts out w/ Crowe as a bit of a bastard but oh, it is so delightful. If you love being transported to other countries in<br />western europe and really get steeped into the breathless beauty of southern France, oh my! If you're patient the real gem lies in the development of<br />Crowe. I loved the music, all the characters- the best friend, the flashbacks and the woman (forget her name) it is a REAL GEM! Don't want to give too much away.<br />I own this and consider it a classic- meaning I can watch it again and again. Enjoy!
B002ZG97RE|5.0|Green Zone, 2010 film<br /><br />It starts with explosions, noise, and confusion as people scurry to safety. American soldiers are looking for a weapons site. Shots are fired. This site is not secured. There is a sniper on a tower who must be eliminated. Protective gear is used before entering a vault. This site is empty. The information was wrong. At the airport a VIP is returned to his country as the designated new ruler. The higher-ups don't want to hear about a failure. \\"How good is the Intel?\\" Its not Miller's job to question orders. [Befahl ist befahl.] The CIA man Martin Brown says \\"something's wrong\\". Another day, another mission. Civilians complain about a lack of water. [No Hurricane Sandy there.] There will be a meeting among the three major groups (Shia, Sunni, Kurds) to meet their new selected leader. There is chaos outside the Green Zone. Brown wants to use the Iraqi army to stabilize the countryside. That's not politically acceptable to Washington.<br /><br />One Iraqi man complains about his treatment. Freddy has information about a meeting. Can they trust him? They arrive at the meeting place and enter this house. Some men get away. One captive won't talk and is taken away. Where did Freddy go? Freddy wants to help his country. Why is the Intel always wrong? The \\"Wall Street Journal\\" reporter Lawrie Dayne asks questions. The story is found on the Internet. That prisoner can't tell them what they want to know. [Note the technique used to question Miller abour that notebook.] Will a million dollars pay a captive to not talk? [Internal conflicts?] Miller's transfer is cancelled. That notebook is confiscated. Miller goes to \\"Camp Cropper\\" to see that prisoner. [You see scenes that are not on Nighttime News.]<br /><br />Armed men enter a house and begin shooting. Miller talks to reporter Dayne about that Magellan information. She won't give up her sources. It's a man in Washington, a Senior Official. [Can you believe everything in the newspapers?] They look up the info on a computer. They hear of an attack on a \\"safe house\\". Can Miller send a message to that Iraqi General Al-Rawi? Can he stop an insurgency? The Americans listen to the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" speech. Miller is tracked by electronic means. Is he \\"off the reservation\\"? All cell phones and electronic media will be monitored. Al-Rawi is to be terminated, and anyone else who is in the way! Miller goes to the bus station. The Allied Forces order the dissolution of all Iraqi organizations. But an American soldier is kidnapped! They will track people by helicopter.<br /><br />Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller is questioned by General Al-Rawi. Those weapons of mass destruction were dismantled in 1991. The US Government believed the lies to invade Iraq. [Or took advantage of their dismantling.] They want to dismantle Iraq! A man warns \\"the Americans are coming\\". They arrive, there is more shooting. The Iraqis flee into the streets. Miller follows. An RPG hits the monitoring helicopter! Miller shoots to save Al-Rawi. But a civilian acts! \\"Go home, Freddy.\\" [Freddy is home.] Miller sends an E-mail about manufactured intelligence. The chosen Iraqi leader arrives for a Press conference. Miller talks to that agent. Dayne gets the E-mail, so too many others. What will happen next?.<br /><br />\\"They have made a desert and call it peace\\" goes an old quote. The War on Iraq marked another departure from past US policy of never declaring war unless attacked. The Gulf of Tonkin was the first manufactured attack, you know how that turned out.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|great service and great movie.  3d version adds much to the experience.  plays well on bluray and great for the grandkids too
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is genuinely scary with a excellent plot and great actor's. Very well written and thought provoking. Every episode slaps you in the face with a viewpoint you have never considered.
B0098460O4|5.0|what a wonderful combination of opera talents Jonathan and Charlotte are. their voices totally compliment each other and they should remain a duo and always sing together.<br /><br />their latest music release of together is so soothing and wonderful, and i highly recommend the item, and wish them well deserved continued success.
B00979CS50|5.0|Once again, the master does it!  I love the ballads, but for sheer force, there is no other band like Neil Young and Crazy Horse!
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Great movie, with all the best super heroes. Cant wait for the next one to come out.  Hopefully they add More super heroes.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I think this a lovely album to listen to. It was an intersting choice of  songs.  Good for Streisand followers
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I actually first became familiar with Kesha from the \\"Tik Tok\\" song and hearing about her duet with Flo Rida on \\"Right Round\\" (which is also featured in the \\"Hangover\\" movie). \\"Right Round\\" also received heavy radio airplay when I was living in both Norfolk, Virginia and Orlando, Florida. I have heard other songs by her but I would have to also put \\"Your Love Is My Drug\\" as one of the songs that I had heard on the radio during the summer of 2010 that grew on me.  The vibe of \\"Warrior\\" reminds me of the vibe of \\"Your Love Is My Drug\\" in an exciting way. Many of the songs combine dance, electronica, and pop in a strong way that fits well with the \\"Warrior Theme\\".  \\"Warrior\\", \\"Crazy Kids\\", \\"Wherever You Are\\", \\"Dirty Love\\" (featuring Iggy Pop), \\"Supernatural\\", \\"All That Matters\\" (The Beautiful Life), and \\"Past Lives\\" are only some of the catchy multiple songs on this cd.  \\"Warrior\\" by Kesha is great if you enjoy musical tracks with pop and electronic elements.
0547884591|1.0|Can anyone on here please confirm that they are now working 4 hour work weeks and are now sporting six pack abs and have lean muscular bodies as a result of the 4 hour body?<br /><br />Tim Ferris is great at hyping himself up but where are the legions of people who have got the results he promised in his previous two ventures.<br /><br />This book is an enjoyable read but nothing else.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This very hard to put down, I started out a little slow picked up real fast and kept me reading.
B0050XFY4O|1.0|Gave up because the quality was so poor, and it kept cutting out.  This happens so rarely with Amazon that I was surprised.  A waste of money.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|WARNING!!! This game is HIGHLY addicting. I played it for a couple hours before I realized it. My children love this game so much. It really keeps them busy and it works their fine motor skills as well. Fantastic game!<br />No glitches or problems so far, and I've had this game for a month. Happy playing.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|This is a great continuation of the reboot of the Bond story.<br />Who would have thought Sean Connery could be improved on - but not diminished.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I think this game is really created to get you to buy more levels, but the good thing is that there are a lot there and you can try and improve your score.  It's a lot of fun and makes you work your brain.
B007T2XC7A|2.0|I love Norah Jones and have most of her albums. I bought this thinking I would also love this one but I was disappointed. I only like 1 song on the whole album. Very different from her other albums.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This app is absolutely a must have app for Kindle Fire owners. It goes way beyond the picture viewer thar comes with they Fire, which is lacking. This app allows you to upload to your cloud a feature that is definately worth having, and also to easily download from your cloud.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I don't rate many books a 5 star. With that being said I really enjoyed the characters in this book!  I can't wait until the next book in the series comes out.  I will definitely buy it.  Keep up the good work Ms. Dobbs!
1452111014|4.0|It's a great book, but it arrived with a page ripped out, so...I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that page was probably good, too :c
B000002O4S|5.0|I love this CD! I love the &#34;Back to the Future&#34; trilogy and for some reason I never bought this album before now. It was a great price for 10 songs. I love &#34;Power of Love&#34; and &#34;Back in Time&#34; and they sound even better on this CD versus listening to the songs on the radio. The overture/music from the soundtrack is great and brings back great memories of seeing the movie for the first time when I listen to this CD. I don't remember track #2 from the movie at all and it is kind of weird. There is an Eric Clapton song on the CD and I didn't remember that he had a song in the movie until I got this CD. &#34;Johnny B Goode&#34; is rock'in and fun to listen to.
0547884591|5.0|Book is absolutely amazing.  Toss it into your December mix along with Mastery by Robert Greene and Nassim Taleb's Anti-Fragile and you'll learn and grow more in a single month than you probably have in a lifetime.  [[ASIN:0670024961 Mastery]][[ASIN:1400067820 Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder]]
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Epic! I hope this book becomes a big hit! I would love to see it made into a movie! I highly recommend it!
145210655X|5.0|This book is a series of comic vignettes showing Darth Vader raising his son (a little Luke) in different Star Wars settings.  I chuckled several times, and laughed out loud a few more.  The attention to detail is excellent, with lots of little inside jokes and references that die-hard Star Wars fans will appreciate.<br /><br />A quick read, but lots of fun.
B005KP77WE|5.0|This is my favorite holiday movie and I was glad that is available on Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital Copy. I have had the VHS for years and watched it many, many times. I love everything about this movie including the actors and the music soundtrack is awesome (I have the soundtrack on CD). I will say that when I watched the movie on Blu-Ray I was a little disappointed with the sound quality. It seems like I had to turn up the volume higher than normal. I know that it was not originally filmed in surround sound so I didn't expect that, but the sound didn't seem as vibrant as I expected. It is still worth buying if you love this movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|Very addicting. great for wasting time on a car ride or in my case on the T. It is also unique, I have never played a game like this before so it is a little refreshing change.
B001706I5I|4.0|Great movie. Perfect remake of the original. Jim Carrey does a great job as the grinch. Great comedy. Highly Recommend.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought two, one for my step dad and one for myself.  The one for my step dad is for Christmas though so I have to hide mine until Christmas I guess!  Great movies, very scientific, Love Sigourney Weaver!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Very refreshing! This book is well researched, Atticus is a great role model. If your looking to get wrapped up in a new world that seems so real. This is the right book for you.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I paid for this product and it said it downloaded successfully, however it will not load on my phone.  You can not re-download or anything with out paying for it again.  VERY disappointed.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I only heard the snippets of their songs through the samplings offered but thought they all sounded good so I took a chance. My Head Is An Animal really blew me away. There are some simillarities with Arcade Fire but that's ok because I love that band too. Of Monsters And Men are no ripoff band however. Each song developes into a swirl of intrigue through catchy, well crafted writing. All in all, I was very, very happy with my gamble.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like how organized this application is.  While I try to use it every day, I don't, but it sends a reminder to let you know that they're thinking about you and I guess it's the caring type of persistence that everyone could use to get to knowing many great versus of the bible!  Great application!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I play the piano,but can't always take it with me. This is a fun application to improve skills while you are out and about.
0061547840|5.0|Definitely a great book with some good topics. recommend it to anyone who wants an extra edge in life and business.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|The first half of the book is great.  But beginning from the middle to the end, the chase and action scenes are total bore.  Very tedious to read, not enough intrigue.
034580404X|5.0|One of the top requested gifts for my wife's christmas list.  She and one of my daughters love to read so I know that this will be a great investment for my family!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Lost City is an adventure game that involves collecting/using items to solve environmental puzzles. The graphics are sharp and the sounds are adequate. The puzzles have a nice balance in difficulty. At no point did I feel clueless, nor did I feel the solutions were ever too obvious/easy. However, the game could be longer. It took me approximately 5.5 hours to complete the game, and unless I suffer from severe memory loss, Lost City has little to no replay value. For $0.99, I would recommend this primarily to fans of enviromental puzzles.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My kids love this game, it's the first game they play every time we travel. Very nice on Android tablet
B003F3FJQO|1.0|This was a poorly done repeat of the maze, except it was set in a scorched wasteland filled with crazy, sick people.<br /><br />It wasn't as exciting.  It was just more of the same, but it was of a lesser quality.<br /><br />How do I handle being duped out of money for a sub-standard work?  I returned it for a full refund.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|I played it a few times only to try to beat my previous score.  This is a great game for those kindergarten to elementary students to help them build mathematical knowledge and to continue to do so.  Very repetitive and fast to build a childs quickness to figuring out problems, Although, not for someone who is in a more advanced class like geometry or algebra unless they really REALLY had problems in elementary school.
0061733199|5.0|Wisdom is valuable, and really would make benefit to those that practice instead of just reading. You may notice little things that have mentioned before on reviews, but photos that are mirrored with instruction was annoying to me because of the confusion it may impose. Over all very nice, but I also somewhat familiar with some of its mentions.<br />I STRESS PRACTICE over just having the tools and camping out for a week. Get real and get into it, strength comes exercising.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great book! There are many plot twists and I couldn't put it down. I'm not one for suspense novels but this one was great! I'm a big baby and it didn't make me scared to go to sleep at night— it's not that type of suspense.<br /><br />I look forward to reading more of Flynn's novels.... if I can find another one that won't make me be fearful to be home alone!
0547884591|5.0|Ive been a long time reader of Tim's books/blog and waited a long time to see this guy get released. the body book changed my life and i expect this one to do the same. It's beautifully assembled and elegantly sequenced!! you can definitely see his growth as an author, and his personality come out on every page.. i especially liked the pairing of the songs to the recipes the way one would pair wines to a meal!! cant wait to try every single one!! great job tim!!!
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I'm getting this for a friend whom truly loves Batman.  He will really enjoy that I've gotten him ALL of the batman movies ever made now, thanks to Amazon!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For adding a quick edge to a good blade, it works great, you should invest in a honing rock to get the proper edge on a new blade.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|I wanted to read this because of all the peple who point to it as &#34;proof&#34; of Obama's beliefs. It is actually the story of a young biracial, binational boy trying to sort out who he is and where he fits in. This struggle helped to prepare him for his role on the world stage.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this one.  relaxing, fun, colorful, can play timed or untimed depending your mood. also great for all ages.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Ahhhh I loved this movie! I loved how he tried to get his wife back but was okay with her not remembering him...I think Rachel McAdams and Tanum did a wonderful job in this movie. :)
1434404374|5.0|I gave this product as a gift and they loved it. I gave this product as a gift and they loved it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was recommended by my child advocaty trainer. It opened my eyes to the inside of a child in the &#34;system.&#34; It was well written and had good developent ot the characters. But, most of all, it helped me to look at the children for whom I advocate in a new light.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out simple, deceptively simple.  You think it's mindless, until the harder levels.  Some of the harder levels makes you really think.  I love logic type games, so this one is perfect for me.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|If you like an epic love story with a twist then you should buy this movie or at least watch the trailer. I personally enjoyed the movie because the main character was strong and not all shy about wanting someone or getting answeres. She shows that if your determained then you can do it.
0375507256|5.0|Such an excellent read.  Thank you David Mitchell, I can't wait to read more of your books. So much better than the movie.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I had to have this as soon as I saw it had come out on DVD - Got it as a birthday present!  Came very fast!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I downloaded the latest update two days ago and now the app will not open. It begins to load then stalls and reverts to the home screen.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I love the movie and it was epic! Your money would be well spent if you buy this movie :). If you don't like the twilight saga then i recommend you pick a different movie.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Eats battery life when running.  Will not display many messages, only a blank screen.  Regular web mail portal works fine.  Often misses messages and then you find them days later when logged in to the web app.  Needs some tweeking and needs to function more like the non-obtrusive default Android mail app.
6305428042|5.0|This is the movie that I have to be watching at Halloween every time I carve pumpkins!  I actually ordered 2 and they both came in a very timely fashion!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Great movie. This is rarely shown on TV. They've been promising a sequel for years. Its supposed to be in 2013.
B000VKHW9Q|5.0|This is a great tool for cutting stainless steel wire rope. I bought it becuse I use rope to prop up things. It's a specialty tool for those of us who use stainless steel cable for projects.
0385504225|2.0|I wanted more… I just wanted more.<br />I have read the previous books and those were more interesting that this one.<br />I got bored at some point, nothing really new.<br />I had the feeling that the book promised answers and gave nothing but a story without any true content.<br />Maybe the movie would be better…
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Loved this show when it was on television!  So happy that I found the complete series DVD set at a really good price!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This was my first Jane Austen read. I enjoyed it and can't wait to read all of Jane Austen's works. I chose this edition because its free. No regrets! Even thought it was a free copy; I have no complaints on its quality. Good stuff :) I recommend this edition. HAPPY READING! :)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch and the Twilight Zone have commonality; unexpected, eye-expanding endings!  This is one heck of a roller coaster read.  I am very happy to have read PINES and will look for other work from this talented author!  Thank you, Mr. Crouch for sharing your talent with me.
141659521X|4.0|I believe this is a realistic view of the political landscape in Afganistan and in the State Department. Like the main characters.  Finished it in two settings.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|When I got my iPad, I did it to do digital drawing. I love this stylist, cause of the size, shape, and weight it brings. Anyone who holds it is instantly delighted, and I have to ask for my iPad back. A true 5 star product.
B009K45Y62|1.0|Great Movie but I recieved TWO Special Features Disk and a DVD Movie Disk. Where's my blu-ray Movie Disk!? I still can't believe this $*#^. Read aleast one other that has two special feature disk instead of the movie. My limited edition # 28155/3500. Anyone else get screwed?
B008I34ZFW|5.0|it wasnt broke or scratched. brand new. cant complain. but the movie itself is pretty dumb. watch at your own risk lol
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on my kindle. Easy to use and challenging. Easy one handed at so I can enjoy my coffee at break and play a quick game.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|It really is a great movie. Watched it when i was a kid a lot of times. Bought it as a gift for my sister.<br /><br />&#34;Gordon's alive&#34; LOL
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I've had this turntable for months and never used it because I don't have a stereo to plug it into.  I realized today that it can just be plugged into the tv using the L/R cables.  Amazingly easy!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love everything she's in and this is no exception. If you want a feel good movie, this is it!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is the best game for anyone who likes pictionary. You don't have to draw well to play. funny. Addictive. Challenging. And if u can draw well u can get more points which equals more free colors or bombs! totally worth the paid addition, the words are better.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|One of, if not the finest movies I have ever seen.  Terrific!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Gives a great history of the pre-war years in England.  The cast was outstanding.
B000YKE87W|5.0|The radiance of his singing in these romantic arias is what makes his Siegmund the most beautiful on record. He is the most interesting Wagnerian singer since Giuseppe Borgatti, and just as handsome. Saw him in Tosca and was amazed. Look forward to seeing him in the roles previewed here so nicely.
1613821670|4.0|I really liked the way this book was printed. I had to use it for an annotation project in an English class, and the wide margins and large print made that much easier. I received it in a timely manner and in perfect condition.<br /><br />I did not, however, particularly enjoy the book. It is well-written, and I can understand its literary merit, but the characters were often very flat, and there were a lot of portions of the book where it seemed to drag on and on. I'm glad I finally read it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't fond of the classics.
B001974DG0|5.0|I would reccomend this book to ANYONE. This is the fourth time i've read this over the years. Its just as great now as it was the first time. His best book. (although they are all good) Just read it and you will understand!!!!!!!!
B00688628M|5.0|Very well done.  Having visited Normandy and Bastogne three times one totally realizes the supreme sacrifice made by so many to restore freedom in Europe.  It is a shame that this history is not taught in schools.  At least here in the U.S.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Issues of property, privilege, freedom, the founding principles of America and the failure or fulfillment of those principles. There is sufficient ambiguity of character that attends great works of art. Along with that are the epic scope, gorgeous photography and scenery produced in the era that just precedes computer assisted filmmaking. The haves are played against the have nots but neither is portrayed as all good or bad. Look for brilliant symbolism: the ring dance that degrades into a brawl at Harvard, later echoed by a bloody circling of the wagons out west when the new hoard of immigrants challenges the status of the old. Though they both left Europe for the same reason, that kinship is lost on the players in a game played with tragic consequences.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|Under rated movie, a classic, and the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Nicolas Cage is AMAZING!  And they made LA look beautiful!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Lovely home, clothes and interesting story.  I usually don't watch shows that you have to follow week to week, but this has captured my heart
B000W746GK|5.0|Item came as described and very quickly. I have not opened it as it is a Christmas present. Everything looks as it should though.
B004AU07O0|5.0|I love Christmas music. . . it helps me to remember the importance of Christmas. . . the spirit of giving and celebrating with Family and Friends.  Every year I look for new CD to add to my collection.  I was so very pleasantly surprised by Christine Aquilera's \\"My Kind of Christmas\\".  I have never bought any of her music before. . . but I will definitely will now.  She has the most amazing voice range. . . She has put such a powerful and soulful spin on some of my favorite Christmas Songs. . . \\"Oh Holy Night\\", \\"This Christmas\\", \\"These Are the Special Times\\".  I was sad to see one comment made from someone about \\"Christine trying to be Black\\".  It's sad that they missed the whole purpose of celebrating the Christmas Spirit. . . anybody who can sing song(s) which lifts the spirit and praises God. . . should be celebrated for what they are trying to accomplish and not for the color of their skin. . . THANK YOU . . . CHRISTINA. . .
B0098VXE50|4.0|I wanted to see this when it was in the theater but I missed it.  When this became available as a lightening deal I snatched it up.  For what I paid I am happy with this purchase.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|The Reacher novels are fast, easy reads and<br />are rather entertaining.  I have read all of the<br />novels and believe Reacher needs more debth;<br />the novels have become monotonous in their<br />similarity.
B0027MJU00|3.0|After reading Gone Girl, I couldn't wait to read more by Gillian Flynn.<br /><br />This book is quite &#34;dark and edgy&#34; which annoys me. The structure used here is the same utilized in Gone Girl, but executed slightly less succesfull. You never know who exactly was the killer, until the very end, which is quite well done. The only issue with this is that if you guess after about 50 pages who the killer is and it turns out to be true, this doesn't hold up too well.<br /><br />Would I recommend this? Ehhhh.... read Gone Girl, and if you're craving for more, this will be a McDonalds meal. It's ok, but after 2 hours, you're hungry again.
B00A3SHW1O|4.0|This is another great album by PitBull.  Lots of guest artist and tons of witty words to go with a dance beat that meets today style.  DJ / Dance and Pittbull a little dubstep and you have global warming.
0547884591|5.0|I am not too far into \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\", but I'm already overwhelmed with Tim Ferriss' intriguing approach to learning and self-experimentation.  I loved his other books and am constantly inspired by his self-improvement travails!  Thanks, Tim, for another great bit of work!
1423140591|5.0|My little brother who is 15 years old is obsessed with this series. This is part 2 of the series. My little brother could not wait for it to arrive.
B002XMBVEM|5.0|I downloaded this album first, because I'm a big fan of Enya and her music; and second,  because Amazon had this album available for my Kindle Fire HD. The sound quality is amazing!
B009E2U7L2|4.0|I like this because it sounds so familar and yet a bit different.  And Cher has a way to sound tough in her little body and voice so she rocks it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed these books. I was captured from beginning to end with the awesome courage & gall of Hugh Howey s characters. The descriptive books make one feel... Awesome!!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|My personal opinion is that &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is one of the best movies of all time. If you have not seen this movie then you are trult missing out.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The story was pretty good. It gradually drew me in. I can't tell if it was the author's lack of knowledge about some of of the details or just poor proofreading, but there were some inconsistencies in the story. I'll probably try one or two more Lee Childs books to see. Did I mention I REALLY like this Kindle?!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We watched this movie a few weeks ago and completely fell in love with it. Great film for any parent who need a little confidence pump for their kids! At least, I think so...
B005HSL626|5.0|He loves it, he plays it when he cakes over to spend the. night and it was free. He is 10.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|Alright, I am a Kamelot fan, so forgive a fan based review; however, if you enjoy Kamelot, then you will enjoy Silverthorn. It is a different, but still sounds like Kamelot. I enjoyed it, and you will too.
B000VWYNNW|4.0|This is a good reintroduction to a band which I much listened to at every party I went to during highshool in the '70's, and I went to many parties so the music never stopped. Now am old enough to \\"get into\\" which I never quite did, it was just the music in the air ya know?
0060555661|3.0|Overall, the condition of the book is good and new, but there are small tears at the edge of some pages. This is my first time purchasing from Amazon so it is quite upset to see these tears. If I'm staying in the states, I would want to seek for an exchange and since I'm staying overseas, it would not be cost effective for me to do.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is a wonderful story about the importance of fathers.  The movie addresses the question of \\"What does it mean to be a father?\\"  This is an important question in our society today when a growing number of children are disconnected from their fathers.  The movie shows us some of the harm that comes when fathers don't take their role seriously and we're reminded of the great strength good fathers can give their children.<br /><br />The movie focuses on five men.  Four of them work together in the local police department.  The fifth man gets adopted by the group.  We watch them as they struggle to meet lives challenges.  One of them has a wakeup call which shakes him to his core.  He decides to be a better father based on what the Bible teaches and asks the other four to hold him accountable.  They decide to join him.<br /><br />My family loves this movie.  It is very well done.  We watch fairly often; when it isn't loaned out.  If you like good wholesome movies with a powerful message then give this movie a try.
B00A3OT34M|4.0|I like some of the songs on the new CD however, the sound is very different for him. It's not bad, just different and will take some gettting used to for me.
6305882592|5.0|I loved it... $3 for the movie, which is a cult classic and Cat Stevens wrote all the music, too
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The Innocent was a great story in all but a bit shorter than I prefer David baldacci is a Wounderfull writer and I can't wait for more of his work.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I have no bad things to say about this processor. Runs cool with stock fan, its lightning fast, and its well priced. I used this in a gaming build for my friend. He is not so tech savvy, so I disregarded overclocking and just went for a locked processor, and this one hasn't let me down thus far. Even if you're on the fence about getting this or say, the i5-3570k, consider that you will need an aftermarket cooler to make full use of the latter, which really adds to your expense. Highly recommended.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|Whew! I thought this book would NEVER end...I just got so overwhelmed by the detail, the continuous use of questions as a means of communicating with the reader that I finally just flashed through the last, oh 200 pages. That being said, the end is worth the effort (or not the effort). So if you can hang in with the incredible story detail/levels, by all means. Or, do what I did and cut to the chase (which is a hell of a chase). I may at some time when I'm not worn out, go back and read it thoroughly but this one could only garner 3 stars this time. I remain a huge fan but this one got me down.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|A must see if you liked the book.  Very well adapted!  I can't wait to see the next two movie in the series!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very disapponted with this book. Didn't like the language or some of the content. Didn't finish yet but what I have read is not what I enjoy reading!
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Science fiction calls for audience to \\"suspend its disbelief\\"  We know going in that what we are about to see is fiction and impossible. But for fun we suspend our disbelief so we can get on with the story.  But about halfway into this flick that threshold collapses and we can no longer enjoy the story because it becomes childishly unbelievable. And even if we extend our license to the director to \\"go ahead, make us believe,\\" it was impossible to avoid giggling while the movie's climax rolled: a woman chasing the baddie while holding her abdomen together with her fingers after she has undergone emergency life-saving surgery conducted by a computerized robot. I don't want to spoil the suspense but my advice is wait for the cable version. We had very high hopes considering this movie's pedigree. But other than a terrific first few minutes, this one is disappointing.
B0012GMUZY|3.0|Not bad, but I prefer his recordings from the 1960's and '70's when his voice reflected what a sweet man he was.
0547884591|5.0|I love it because its so different from any other cookbook. You could just read it front to back and it will hold your interest.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|extremely well done and clean for a change. No social depravity just good Guys and bad Guys. Oops forgot to mention the Good Girl too.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a story about people in a hole in the ground; how long can you keep that going?  Seven books with an eighth on the way and fans clamoring for more.  It is NEVER boring, I picked up this when I went on leave for the holidays and read for almost 26 hours straight.  I only stopped to eat and show my face to my family each night.  You don't even need to be a sci-fi buff to love it, the characters are so good!  You can watch their motivations like a river.  I think he could have spent more time on this aspect but it's not lacking, that's more jut a way of me saying I wanted to read it longer.  After reading this series, I immediately bought every book he has on Kindle and It hasn't disappointed.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|At first I couldn't get it to work on my Samsung Galaxy S3.  Time after time it kept crashing and I couldn't figure out why.  I finally used MYbackup Pro (works with Titanium Backup too) and cleared data and cache then uninstalled it.  redownloaded it and went through initial setup again.  Works perfectly.
B000G7FSLS|2.0|Although the movie is an excellent one, this copy is very bad, it cuts some good scenes of the movie. One is trying to not do piracy and the problem is tha sometimes piracy is better quality than the \\"legal\\" option...
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Christina's music & amazing voice.  Her new CD &#34;Lotus&#34; is by far one of her best ever.  I purchased the CD 3 weeks ago and have not taken it out of my car CD player.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who has been through a rough relationship.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|A W E S O M E ! ! !<br />Definitely 4 out of 5 stars (easily). Arrived as foretold.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Life of Pi - I would recommend to everyone. my grand daughter, daughter and sister are now reading it. Beautiful book!
B009MF56GC|5.0|It has all everything that a action fan wants. All the great action actors are in one movie. They are worth the salt as they still can perform most of the fighting and action sences. Even the storyline is thin, the fights and action will able to off set the short coming. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does all needed functions,  no problems or bugs, nice sized buttons.  Best of all,  it is free! What else can I say?
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  Michael Lewis is a good storyteller.  I like the way he told the story through some of the key people.  He brought the story to life, and there were quite a few \\"characters\\" that added a unique angle.
0553381695|5.0|I didn't read Book One, but did watch the entire season that HBO created and found it extremely well done, if not outright impressive. After a few episodes, I was hooked on the story and wanted to see where it would go. Since the HBO series followed Book One so closely, I felt that I could jump right into Book Two, which I did, and I thoroughly enjoyed the 700+ journey. I am not typically a reader of fantasy (or sci-fi, for that matter), but this story has just the right mix of realism and fantasy, without all of the mysticism or magic that accompanies other books of the genre, such that the Game of Thrones series is almost completely believable.<br /><br />Martin has created a whole new world, like unto the world that we know here, but different enough that the reader recognizes its differences while still being able to relate to the characters' overall way of life. Everything about the book is impressive: the characters are deep, rich and complex, the scenery and picture painted for the reader is beautiful, the plot is addicting and the dialogue is skillfully written. There are scores of people passing in and out of Martin's world and it takes some time to keep everyone straight, but they are well developed, realistic, and all truly different. I simply do not understand how Martin sat down and developed the storyline and characters that he has, but like millions of people around the world, I am now one of the beneficiaries of his creativity and hard work. Thank you GRRM.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Gritty, real, funny and well written!! If you like his previous work you will not be disappointed!! Can't wait for the next trilogy!!
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Would recommend, great follow up and has to be my favorite one of the series. If you liked the first two you should like this one too.
B005OTGS4E|5.0|Haven't tried to watch is yet. I'm in no hurry, so if you want to know if it played well, then you'll have to wait.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|This is an amazing calendar, however, the Amazon app store is not carrying the most updated version of Business Cal (1.4.1.3). The most updated version is supposed to be compatible with Kit Kat. This version, 1.3.2.3, is not compatible. So if you are buying this great App from Amazon, rather than another app store, the widget will not work on your phone.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I thought this book was fantastic.  It picks up right where Delirium leaves off, and continues following the story of Lena.  It shows a whole new world, that of The Wilds and what life is like for an invalid.  It was gripping and I really enjoyed it.  Can't wait for the next book!!
030758836X|5.0|There were a lot of twists and turns, it kept me reading and guessing. Although I didn't hop to the end, I thought I knew what happened to her but the ending had a quirk I couldn't imagine.
B009JBZH54|5.0|These movies literally give me chills. I've seen all the Batman movies ever released and this new style is by far my favorite. I watched Dark Knight Rises so loud last night it scared my dogs, it really rumbles the speakers. The bluray quality is amazing. Buy and enjoy!
B005LAIGSM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and it certainly doesn't hurt that Channing Tatum's in it.  I love the actress too.
0307891372|5.0|Very complete game. Good story, nice graphics and cool characters with alot of add-ons to download on the internet. I just wish I had more time to play.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|FINALLY....I can take pics with the camera. I didn't mind spending the $ on the app, because it is worth it. I love the panoramic cam.....it's awesome.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Denzel Washington has long been a favorite actor of mine.  DeJavu is a continuation of his excellent work and will enjoyed by all.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|My fiancee and I ordered this the other night. We had read the reviews and decided to give it a shot anyways. We are so glad we did. We loved the dynamics between the characters, we loved the story line... Everything! We would recommend this to anyone who asked :)
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you grew up in the 70s and 80s like I did, This movie stays pretty close to the comics.
B00A0R02HO|3.0|Decent action, love the cityscapes, the nods to the original were good. Would have liked to had more dialog from the main character.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a cute game when you want to sit and do nothing! its easy to play and it loaded on to my kindle easy enough
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very intriguing and creative, superb acting. Jessica Lange is a definate for Best Actress Emmy. Can't wait for the next episode!
B000JIJPZY|5.0|This is a real good toy for babies who have to do tummy time and are learning to crawl. With all the colorful toys it encourages them to crawl, set up and reach for the toys. It works very well to get them to like tummy time better.
0783229526|5.0|I got the used version, it was in tip top shape. There wasn't even a scratch on it. This movie is great, i reccomend anyone getting it.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Frankly, I thought it a little boring at times. Save it until there is nothing else that you want to see.
B00122RFOO|5.0|I love just about every song he has done, but this album is my very favorite-which is why I decided to put it on my Kindle fire HD-I can listen to it anytime I want now.
B007BLCGNU|2.0|I am all for the bio-pics.  Usually love them, even if it tends to be more bio that 'pic'.  But this one just never really seemed to move anywhere.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I just adore johnny depp. BUY THIS MOVIE. It looked brand spankin new when coming into the mail. I was very satisfied.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! This is such a good read, if you like books that make you laugh out loud, swoon and fan yourself because of the sexual tension that these two characters emit, then this is the book for you! These characters swept me off my feet from page one and kept me guessing, laughing and hoping there'd be a HEA, because even though it's a romance and the HEA is going to be there, Kelly did such a great job writing this, I wondered for a second if there was any hope at all for these two. Megan is one of those true-to-life heroines that you want to root for and could see yourself as her best-friend. Connor, the heroine is dreamy...flawed emotionally, but still redeemable. He's a hero worthy of falling in love with right along side the heroine. And I absolutely loved his buddy Jeff and am secretly hoping for his story...<br /><br />What I loved the most about this was the character's interactions and their ability to laugh at each other and at themselves. To me, there is nothing sexier than laughter in a book that isn't done with slap-stick scenes, but through dialogue and action. I can't wait to see what Ms. Kelly does next, because I'll definitely buy it. :)
0547884591|5.0|I  got my book about two weeks ago trying the recipes and following the low carb diet, I Love it !!!

030758836X|4.0|This is the first book by Gillain Flynn that I've read. I am not going to rehash the whole story, because other reviews do that as well as a description on the main page. I really enjoy the writing style, it's written from a `his' and `hers' point of view. It seesaws back and forth between the two, giving us glimpses into both their thoughts.  There are roadblocks and new ingredients thrown into the mix in almost every chapter, so it's very hard to put down. I read it all in the last 36 hours, sacrificing some sleep last night to finish it. While the book was intense and unique, I was disappointed with the ending. I think it could've played out a little better. Aside from the writing was engaging and the story addicting, a great psychological thriller. I indented to check out some other books by this author.
B009SJ46EA|3.0|Last season was creepy, but also a lot of fun to watch and there was always an interest in what would happen next. This season is just kind of full of things that make you very uncomfortable (torture, evil Santa, rape, Nazis). Every week, I'm half excited/half disturbed about watching the next episode.In fact, I was just kind of bothered by the fact that there are probably 5 more episodes to watch this season (13 total).I hope next season returns to more ghostly fun.
B0007PALSE|4.0|its a movie it works what else can i say . . . . . . . . . . .
B008QTVNUI|1.0|Honestly - there is a lot of sex and nudity...only made it through 2.5 episodes when we realized it wasnt going to go away...a lot of people recommended this to us - so we really didnt expect it...it did seem to be a strong story line, so not certain why they had to put all the graphic (and it is pretty graphic) sex...bummed about it...
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The simple tips you get in this book about cooking are gold. I was going to just get it on the kindle, but with Tim Ferris's big push to market the book I figured I would try the print version. I would never go back. Tim was right when he said this book was made for print. It is very thick and loaded with pictures. I am not even sure how they made money on this book because practically every page is color. Very visually fun to read.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|Great book, but you have to be persistent, as it's really slow to take off... but once you get to the last third, it's mind blowing!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Without the annoying ads, I would have given it 4 stars.  I'm thinking about removing it from Kindle and finding any company's version of Solitaire that I can enjoy without ads.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|What an exciting and amazing movie!!!  I enjoyed it so much!  I think it's really cool that such a large-scale movie could also be such an engrossing character study.  Epic!  Just Epic!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously. Above everything else that's wrong with this book (and there is plenty), the thing that drove me up a wall is how boring and repetitive the writing is. The phrase \\"holy crap\\" (and it's variants thereof) is used from everything of losing her keys to having a hard relationship-based conversation, and appears at least one every page and a half. I've come across quite a few reviews bashing this series rightfully on its views on sexuality and glorifying pedophilia, but nothing had prepared me for the inanely flat way the threadbare story was written.<br /><br />The other problem is the characters themselves. They're all cardboard cutouts. I don't even hate Ana the way I did with Bella, because she doesn't have a personality to hate...hell, her  \\"snarky\\" subconscious and her inner goddess (two separate entities, for those who have yet to read the book)  have more defined personalities than her best friend Kate, Jose the Jacob stand-in (I'm assuming she'll hook up with him in book 2, but I won't be reading) and even Christian.<br /><br />Not much to be said that hasn't already been said. My best advice is to find a reading done with Mickey Mouse's or other animated cartoon voice of your choice on Youtube and save yourself ten dollars.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|We loved it. The chemistry between the characters and the attitude of both Watson and Sherlock is great. We eagerly await each new episode.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Well illustrated, with many patterns along with variations of the patterns.  Very good instructions any beginner can follow.  I would recomend this for anyone wanting to do this type of craft.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The overall plot was a little predictable (kinda like turkey on Thanksgiving), but what makes this installation great and enticing is the stuffing, gravy, pies, and sweet potatoes (again like Thanksgiving). I had a feeling going into this book that Ana and Fifty would end up back together. I had a feeling the rules would change. And I had a feeling that his need to be a Dom most likely stemmed from some childhood issues. Fifty's &#34;accident&#34; took me by surprise, as did his almost 180 degree turn around with his ability to show real affection. All in all a great read!
B007NU54H4|5.0|This is a great product - quick service - kids loved it and I would definitely purchase this item again
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|Love Schmidty and the others.  Makes my husband and I laugh out loud every episode.  Definitely relate to the mid-lto-late-20-something experience,(even though we're not there anymore), fun to reminisce...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved the first two seasons of Downton Abbey and can't wait until Season 3 begins in the U.S. in January. Can't decide whether to watch it on TV or wait until I have the DVD. More than likely, I will watch it first on TV, then again on DVD!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My friends went through a posting frenzy about this book on Facebook, which made me curious. I must say that of the 3 books this one I feel has more surprise only b/c we don't quite yet know what to expect of the relationship. However, at the same time I feel this is the one that's most poorly written... Now that's not to say I don't like it b/c I definitely thoroughly enjoyed it. I just found myself relaxing more into the other books as opposed to pointing out errors and irritants about the style of writing that came across. It was of course filled with passion, surprise, and fantasy. And although this was not my first exposure to the erotica genre it was the first from this particular perspective which makes the characters much more relatable.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|For anyone who loved George this is a MUST for your collection...it is respectfully done by his closet friends/family you will not regret it
B006DRVFRQ|1.0|Not able to get it to work for my gmail account, it could be my fault but I planning to uninstall and find a different program.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This is a keeper and a reread, Kept me guessing who did it, and kept me engaged in the reading process. John Grisham is an excellent writer.  Surprise ending is just what I look for in a novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love some of the elements of surprise! I wasn't expecting one of the people to be involved with all the mishaps that turned out to be, which was a nice little twist... Although the other two were pretty obvious. For a brief moment I was concerned that they were going to kill off our leading lady, or do something crazy like have her end up in a coma and wake up 5 years later with a baby and an impatient Fifty. LOL. This being the final installment of the series makes me sad, but nonetheless it put a nice shiny bow on the trilogy.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|LOVE IT!! Obssessed with anything George Harrison lately..very interesting and the video was done with elegance and grace George deserved
B004VMUS9G|5.0|very customizable and well designed. this ap is great and i love the fact that i can change the music when i begin to sleep through it.  deserves a try, you will make it your choice.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Love this on my tablet use it all the time.  I am a teacher and it is a great teaching tool my students will use this instead of a hard cover Dictionary.  Some actually sit and just look up words, it's amazing what tech. will inspire young people.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|you can find my review on my blog as well : Pandemonium Review @ [...]<br />KATIE'S THOUGHTS:<br /><br />Pandemonium picks up right where Delirium leaves off, Lena is found in the Wilds by Raven, and taken to a nearby homestead with other Invalids. After a period of time in the Wilds, Lena joins the resistance and goes into the city undercover, much like what Alex did in Delirium. The story is not told in a traditional Linear fashion, each chapter jumps from \\"then\\" ( when Lena was found, and living in the wilds ) to \\"now\\" (Lena working as an undercover resister within the city walls.)<br /><br />I was not a huge fan of the whole \\" Now / Then\\" skipping back and forth. It was done with purpose and thoughtfully written, I personally however am not a fan of that many flashbacks, i found my self aggrivated at times, especially when i was super into the \\"now\\" parts.<br /><br />That being said, this novel was wonderfully written, Lauren Oliver has mastered the art of Cliffhangers! Just when you thought that the end of Delirium couldn't be topped with it's to-die-for suspensefull ending, somehow Oliver manages to make the end of Pandimoneium even more jaw dropping ( seriously you should have seen my face! I could tell what was going to happen, i saw it comming from a couple of chapters away.... but yet.. my jaw couldnt help but drop!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|A perfect blend of gritty politics and dark fantasy, Game of Thrones is sure set a standard future TV series will be judged upon.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|if you can read between the lines and follow his blog you don't really need this book, I still think his best work is 4HWW. But this is coming from a guy who has been cooking all his life, so I just bought this for the mets learning stuff, and in this particular regard there is no one better than Tim
0307744434|4.0|The book had multiple characters with difficult names. While it would have been helpful for the author to provide a \\"family tree\\" of sorts it's still a good read. Don't worry about trying to follow who's who, just pay attention to the dates at the beginning of the chapters and just keep reading; it comes together. The author has a unique voice and while not a fast read, it's refreshing and enjoyable.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I can access the app, but I cannot access the books in my library or read them on my Android.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My kids love this movie (and I do too). It's not scary, it's funny and fun! Definitely a family favorite.
1608871452|5.0|Supernatural has become one of my favorite shows and this book is a nice collector's piece!  I'm still getting caught up on all the seasons and the breakdown of each one so far is nice to have.  Its great to read the thoughts of the cast and crew and how they feel about their different roles in the show.  Lots of fun souveniers as well. :)
B000V86OKG|5.0|The the DVD came right away. I'm glad I started watching Dexter. Maybe after someone orders season one, they should be told they might buy second 2-7 together!
B002VWNID6|5.0|If you like Robin Hood and you haven't seen this movie (or own it) yet, you're missing out. It has a solid plot and good acting, what are you waiting for?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My family loves this movie. It is a great adaptation of the book, and a movie with an important point that doesn't shove it down your throat.
1451695187|4.0|SOMETIMES A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW BUT OVERALL A WELL WRITTEN AND UNDERSTANDABLE STORY. IT CERTAINLY WAS BELIEVABLE EVEN IN THIS AGE OF DOUBT OF THE SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.

B007L6VR12|5.0|I got this movie for my boyfriend. He is a really big Wes Anderson fan. The movie is super cute and fun.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is no Jungle Book! I'm Obsessed, as I have ever been in a very long time, for totally different reasons. Can't wait to see the movie in 3D... But better to read the book first! A bargain that gives a big bang for your buck on Kindle right now!
B00A3YTC6Q|5.0|I  enjoyed this movie very much, I have all the other ones. I would highly recommend this movie. very pleased with the service.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We've only watched the 3D version; if there is a less expensive way to purchase just the type of DVD we use, I missed it.  Movie is great; 3D effects keep getting better; no problems.
B005KELS6Q|4.0|I have never liked the Amazon sleeve for my kindle touch and was seeking a non-leather zip-sleeve alternative.<br /><br />Good: it is very light and the kindle touch fits very well in it. I got the pink which is a nice color. I was worried about the silicon part being awkward but it is actually quite nice and makes it grabbable. But it is not sticky so it doesn't get caught on any pockets in my bag.<br /><br />My two cons:<br />1. The description stated there would be a panel to protect the screen. The fabric of the cover itself it not terribly tough so I was interested in that. When I got the product I realized there is no built-in screen protection. I assume the panel is the styrofoam-like panel that I thought was merely packaging materials (to hold its shape in shipment)? When I pulled that back out of the trash and placed it back in the sleeve, the kindle not only fit better (more snug) but that panel technically does offer screen protection. I would have preferred a built-in panel. The kindle is easy to remove and put back with the panel remaining in the sleeve though.<br />2. Would be nice to have the zipper go all the way around either the top or bottom so it could be charged while in the sleeve. However I was aware of this when I purchased it so I am discounting this con.<br /><br />This is still not a perfect kindle sleeve for me. But it's better than my previous.
B0031QNDUO|5.0|Who could not like this very family minded classic Christmas movie that is geared for the whole family. Modern Hollywood could learn so much from movies like this and a story like this. If you really like the holiday season you will forever think you just watched the real Santa when you watch this wonderful movie. I loved how great it looked on my roku box from Amazon videos, it looked just like the dvd. I hope everyone will watch this great Christmas story every Holiday season.
B0049VZ222|5.0|What can I say. I watched season 1 as recommended by my friends fully expecting to thik it was lame. I caught up with all the seasons within 3 day LOL
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is one of my favorites.  It is very much like playing on my laptop.  The transition to playing on my kindle was minimal.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Finally! A game that really makes you use your brain! Amazing! You will love this game if you are into building and logic!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Great movie, we love to watch this as we put up our christmas tree and on Christmas Eve. Now Blu-ray makes it even better.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is great. I use it every day. I have recommended it to everyone I know. Its so easy to use.
0805087184|5.0|Wonderful way to teach my preschool students their colors. They loved the story too, especially because they get to read along because of its repetitive nature. Great book for any classroom library. I know I will use it for years.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I continue to be impressed with Joe Abercrombie's writing and would recommend this book to any fan of fantasy .
B0063IH60K|5.0|What better way to pass the time! Even with the ads on the free version this is great! Nothing better than solitaire!
B001NLKT60|3.0|I didn't like this book as much as the first. I understand that we needed some history of the characters but could have gone without some of the lengthy stories.
B000NA28I4|5.0|my mom loved it so it was very worth buying ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I really like this awesome book because it has a lot of humor. J.K Rowling has outdone herself once again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this bible program! So many versions to choose from, wonderful reading plans to follow. Easy to see/read print. So happy to have found this, highly recommend!
B0087HT36U|4.0|My kids had lots of fun playing this game. Was kinda sad when they beat the last level. Guess we will have to buy a new one. : )
B001EN71HC|5.0|I don't really have anything bad to say about this. It's the 3 Austin Powers movies I love and I thought the sound/picture quality was fine.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|this album did not disappoint!!! first of all, i bought it because i watched the movie &#34;the tourist&#34;, with my fave hottie Johnnie Depp and fell in love with the final song played at the end during credits. i had no idea who it was so i just googled a few words from the song, along with the title of the movie and voila! i had only previously heard of muse once as being the band that Stephanie Meyer listened to the whole time while writing the &#34;Twilight&#34; series. I only have two albums by muse so far but look forward to acquiring their whole body of work- i love love love their sound
B005HSL626|5.0|My kids love this game. It is easy enough for even the youngest kid to have fun with! Thanks for a good game!
B002V092B0|5.0|This book came highly recommended and I have to say I was dubious - reading about someone having a stroke??  I WAS WRONG.  I am a teacher - I am passionate about developing my own learning and this book has opened the way to me for researching and playing with new strategies to help my students learn in ways that suit them.<br /><br />This is a powerful story about one woman's determination to get back to where she was but with a greater understanding of empathy, creativity and the need for balance in our lives.<br /><br />In addition - it will save lives - it will develop the medical professions understanding of what is happening inside a stroke victims head - it will develop their empathy
B004GYY714|5.0|This is the most awesome music app you could ever have. My other music apps just went out the window! Very quick to install and does what it's supposed to. This is what radio is supposed to be! we've come a long way from the 40's & 50's !<br />[[ASIN:B004GYY714 TuneIn Radio]]
0547884591|4.0|I downloaded the Kindle version and have already purchased a few of the recommended tools, like the microplane zester. What a great tool.<br />This latest book is much like the other 2 for me, as desk references for remembering how to continue to live La dolce vita.<br /><br />Reading The 4 Hour Chef inspired me to crack back open my hardcover of 4 Hour Body (for slow carb tips), as well as listen back to the 4 Hour Work Week CD's again, driving from Chicago to Michigan for my job.<br /><br />Speaking of my job, after listening to the 4 Hour Work Week back in 2009(?), I left my 9-5 daily cube-trapped life, moved to Chicago with my girlfriend, and work on MY schedule, while KEEPING my job.<br />The 4HWW inspired me to approach our management team with the idea that I work remotely from Chicago, for our company in Michigan.<br /><br />This was almost 5 year ago! And I'm still doing it.<br /><br />All 3 books are great references.<br /><br />My one critical suggestion would be, for your next book, maybe drop the \\"4 Hour\\" name.<br />I understand your reasoning, but would be interested in a departure from this moniker.<br /><br />Keep up the great work Tim!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Of course this game is a hit, it is so much fun to play, easy and addictive! The whole family loves it!
B000002JPA|5.0|Wild to see this band on here. I saw them in Chicago the early 90's with Scott & Chad Farmer. Scott said this band was going to make it! They really rocked us that night.
B001M5RR4Y|5.0|Fascinating story and a historical topic that is rarely covered.  The music is also fantastic and accessible whether or not you love opera.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|At first it's a bit hard to understand the moves of the game and how to work through the various scenarios. I've played for approximately four hours and am now just finding out the workings of the game. It's getting a bit addictive but, enjoyable I would recommend it to anybody that enjoys though full hidden object games, puzzles, and quests in a game.
B0086700CM|5.0|My kids love this game. I have tried it and sad to say Stink at it! But they are great!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I purchased this album for a couple of songs! I was surprised that the whole album is as if it were a storybook made of songs, each one telling a story, independent but under the same atmosphere of monsters and men. Fiction and fantasy meet music.
0316017922|5.0|I picked this book up in hardcover in a bargain section. I had ment to read it because I was fascinated with Gladwell's 10,000 hour theory. It had me thinking, is 10,000 hours all that is necessary to amount to the Highest level of a sport or even subject? Is that what this book is suggesting?<br /><br />Now after having read the book I see an insight in to what factors get people to that \\"High Level\\" of their trade or endeavor. It's not simply being a \\"Genius\\" or simply having an affinity for something. There are a number of factors that come in to play aside from just being good at what you do or working at. In the case of Hockey Gladwell shows that the Month of  a person's birth plays in to it for no other reason than the way the Hockey schedule of play is organized. Being a successful lawyer in a particular area is more or less related to being forced by circumstance in to an area you had not necessarily planned to go in to but had no choice if you wanted to survive then suddenly see that area become \\"hot\\" and your existing presence and experience makes you the Superstar.<br /><br />I took away from the book that yes, 10,000 hours focused on one endeavor, such as the Beatles with music or Bill Gates with computers mixed with a natural affinity or love of that endeavor will get you deep in to being the on the top of that pile. Making it the rest of the way is easy if you have the environment that fosters that available to you like Bill Gates with access to the computer systems, or the Beatles with their solid Germany gigs that were so demanding. If you don't have that environment you may end up like Chris Lanagan, eventually noticed for being the man with the Highest IQ in the world but unnoticed in the area of Academics where he should have excelled except for his environmental factors kept him down.<br /><br />Finally, I have personally seen the Outlier affect work as this book states it would but that was with someone who was not really a Genius but smart however their love of a certain subject, spending many hours on it, saw them excel in their field. This is in keeping with what Gladwell presents in this book and that mixed with a lot of information added in I was oblivious to I give it five stars as an overall positive learning experience.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I really love this film, it's one of my favorite movies. It shows a more human Superman that feels and wants the things we all want: Love, Family. Brandon Routh is fantastic as The Man of Steel, he truly embodies the character the same way Christopher Reeve did in the older movies. Most of the cast if perfect, especially Kevin Spacey as Luthor. You really feel his hatred for Superman like never before. Score is wonderful and old school. It's a great story worthy of this superhero, and it feels like a classic. This is my favorite superhero film because it's more than just action and special fx; there is lots of heart and a deep story, something a lot of movies in the genre lack.
B005OYHF0A|4.0|Most of the books in software development market today either describe some new cool technology or a way how should things be done in ideal circumstances. This one is different though. It doesn't assume that you work on the perfect project. It assumes, that you work exactly on that kind of project, where Mike didn't test that important piece of code because release was scheduled on that Friday, Bob was new and didn't know the framework properly and Joe hated his job anyway, so he just hacked it asap. Yeah, that's pretty much how the code is written in lot of companies.<br /><br />This books feels your pain and offers you a comprehensive list of advices, that address everyday problems (what should I do if ...) of programmer working on such application. You will learn a lot of about how to put code under tests and various techniques to achieve so (mainly breaking dependencies). It is true that sometimes I felt like reading very obvious things with fancy names, but at most times I was able to recognize real world situations and map the example to the real problem that I've already faced.<br /><br />I am rating this with 4 out of 5 stars because some parts were simply boring (for me mainly the beginning). Also the older release date makes some parts less relevant (as of 2012), but I would still recommend reading this to the most of the developers, because I can guarantee that you will find yourself nodding and smiling on certain samples and thinking \\"yeeees, I've seen this, that's totally like in our company ...\\".
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!  All of the seasons are great nd every year they get better.  No wonder NCIS has remained on the top of the ratings for all these years.  Highly recommended for someone who likes adventure with a twist of individuality!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The finale was everything I would expect it to be. The characters in the show are amazing and the writing just keeps getting better and better! Waiting in deep anticipation for the start of Season 4.
B004RUBH88|3.0|This &#34;enriched&#34; edition has the complete, unabridged, story as well as 3 pages of literary allusions and notes, 11 1/2 pages of critical excerpts, 1 page of suggestions for further reading and a page and a half about Dickens.  If you want to read the story this is a good version.  If you want more complete notations I would suggest you look into the Patrick Hearn annotated Christmas Carol.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves the story and it is inexpensive enough that any one can afford it plus it would make a great stocking stuffer.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Great  insight into the housing bubble and the financial machine behind it. I'll probably read it many more times.  great book.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />Growing up I became accustomed to the comic book style atmosphere of Batman. If you're a baby boomer you remember that during fight scenes bursts would light up the screen with blurbs saying \\"Bam\\" and \\"Pow.\\" Those days are gone.<br />Christian Bale returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne in this third installment, The Dark Knight Rises.<br />The key word is dark. Batman has disappeared for eight years. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. Wayne Enterprises is tettering on bankruptcy. Wayne's longtime family friend and go to man, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) leaves.<br />The only thing that brings the caped crusader to the surface is a terrorist named Bane, who plans to get hold of a nuclear weapon and destroy Gotham.<br />When Batman has his intial fight with Bane he is defeated, even crippled. Bane dumps the super hero's tattered body in a foreign prison, where escape is virtually impossible. He sets up a television where Batman can watch as Gotham is brought to it's knees and eventually destroyed.<br />While in this hole Wayne is told by other inmates how only one small child has ever escaped from this prison. The prison is one of the coolest, dark parts of the film.<br />It, a variation of the Batplane called \\"The Bat,\\" and a new Batcave were created especially for The Dark Knight Rises.<br />The movie is currently the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, the second-highest-grossing film of 2012, and the second highest grossing superhero film of all time. One cool pix.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Been playing this game for 20 mins now. Actually enjoyed it while playing but things started to get repetitive really bad at this time. If youbhave a young kid they probably ger a kick out of it. Did find it a bit weird that there was no instructions on screen when playing. I just had to start clicking things to see what would happen.
0307730697|5.0|Reading this book was like reading something out of a movie.  Adam's story was truly inspiring and gives us pause to think about our lives and how we allow so many petty obstacles to prevent us from achieving, or even considering, our potential to achieve and make an impact with our lives and on those around us.  He overcame so very, very much and it was a wonderful story of living life as a man committed to God, his family, and his country.  The book was well written and a page turner.  Excellent book and I'd highly recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite book and i cant wait to read the 3rd book and find out what happenes after peeta gets taken
B005LAIIQC|5.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br />I can't imagine how Tony Gilroy, the director of The Bourne Legacy and Jeremy Renner, the actor who would replace Matt Damon as the lead felt.<br />The previous three Bourne films were top notch. It's a lot to live up to. But the director and actor didn't just match the previous three films, they surpassed them with more action, more thrills and high intensity stunts you'll have trouble wrapping your brain around.<br />There are various photos and snippets of Borne (Damon) throughout the film but it's clearly Jeremy's reign as he enters as Aaron Cross, a member of a black ops program whose agents are genetically enhanced.<br />Cross soon comes to realize the U.S. Defense Department is shutting down the program and terminating all agents involved.<br />The pills he's been taking have run out. He knows his seemingly super powers will soon follow, and he will go through withdrawal. They send a drone to destroy him in a remote cabin in Alaska. He eludes the first drone only to be cutoff by a wolf pack.<br />He eventually gets back and teams up with the only surviving geneticist Dr. Marta Shearing. He knows she's on the list for elimination too. He must get them out of the country and off the grid fast, but his withdrawal is giving him flu-like symptoms. They wind up in a flophouse, where Cross attempts to recover while consoling Dr. Shearing.<br />The final motorcycle chase is the finest to ever enhance any screen. Be prepared to be thrilled beyond compare.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good and entertaining.  Sometimes I want to go deep and thought provoking, other times I just want to be entertained.  This book accomplished elements of both those needs.  It is an easy read and I appreciate that.
B005PK553C|5.0|Surprise is the best word I can give for this show.  I first watched it because I was in the mood for something a little edgy, but it didn't take long for me to get completely taken in by the series.  This show is extremely well written.  I don't watch a lot of TV, and often think that TV shows lack a certain continuity to the storyline, like each week they come in and say, \\"Okay, what should happen in this week's episode?\\"  I never felt that way with this show -- in fact, the skilled way in which they connected the episodes often completely surprised me; I don't expect the stories of TV productions to be this well thought out.  It felt more like reading a really good book than a series of disjointed short stories.  It has a wonderful cast as well, so you can expect great acting to go along with the story.  If you are like me, you will be pleasantly surprised at how much you enjoy this show!
1568363850|5.0|I've studied Japanese for a few years in both classroom and self-study formats. Japanese for Busy People (JFBP) is probably the single best option for self-study, both elementary acquisition and for review. I use it for both review of previous learning and for continued additional learning.<br /><br />I highly recommend the kana version, again for both new students and review. It will take practice and a kana learning book for self-starters, but that's true even in a classroom setting -- you'll be forced to learn kana very quickly and it's mostly a routine exercise of practice.<br /><br />JFBP excels for self-learners for three reasons: (1) the content is deliberately reduced to cover only what's required; it has much, much less vocabulary than a typical college text such as Genki.  (2) the situations are more focused on adult learners and business travelers (e.g., business introductions, going to restaurants, shopping) and not those of younger people (movies, home visits).  (3) the books are very affordable and are in a semi-workbook format instead of a text.<br /><br />The only limitation is that the audio materials are skimpy; it would be nice to have many hours of extended dialog and practice instead of just a couple hours of minimal dialog and vocabulary. Japanese Pod 101 or similar audio podcasts might help supplement that (and are certainly not enough on their own to learn well).<br /><br />I have the 2nd edition as well, and highly prefer the 3rd edition. The lessons flow much better and it is much more modern in the general presentation style; it's highly worth the moderate cost to get the new version.<br /><br />Good luck! Ganbatte kudasai!
B00004D301|1.0|I like the movie; however, when I bought this one, I put it into the DVD player and it said &#34;out of region&#34;; therefore, this DVD is not from the United States.  You can play it up to 4 times on your computer by changing the region; but you can't play it on your TV.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is poorly written. If it was better written perhaps it could keep my attention.  Characters and plot are not believable and very boring.  Just can't believe the hype.
B004FQX59I|2.0|I liked this movie when I saw it in the theater, but... this isn't the movie I saw in the theater. Hey, if a director wants to get his or her jollies by recutting a movie, go for it, but at least make sure the original theatrical version is available. I've seen this movie many times, but the additional mish-mash of scenes on the bloated director's cut detract from the drama and tension of the original. Historical inaccuracies aside, this was a thought-provoking movie when it was released; Now, in it's current incarnation, it only provokes. When I see the director's cut, I am taken out of the movie with thoughts of how much better it used to be.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|If you have read Michael Connelly's books, don't buy this.  Some of it is verbatim from other books and is not new material.  Disappointing
034580404X|3.0|I read the books--expecting something deeper and darker--but although entertaining, the book's characters never became \\"real\\" to me. Grey's age does not match the persona--I kept picturing him as in his mid-thirties, with some more life experience (beyond the obvious). Some of the settings and experiences were definitely interesting--however the characters' escapades failed to move me one way or the other. Ultimately this trilogy turned out to be Fifty Shades of Boredom, times three.
1451695195|1.0|If only Eben Alexander had titled his book \\"I Believe.\\" He happens to be a<br />neurosurgeon. His profession is irrelevant to his experience, and yet he hangs his whole story on it, as if to lend it credibility.  The same story should be able to be told by a car salesman, with the same weight.<br /><br />The story is quite simple. The patient contracted a horrendous bacterial meningitis and was unconscious for almost a week. He came out of a coma with a recall of visions and experiences that he says could not have been dreamed because the thinking parts of his brain were \\"totally offline.\\" This, he says, proves that his remembrances were not dreams but rather real events that happened out of his brain and body. In fact he calls them not reality but \\"ultra-reality.\\"<br /><br />But in fact, no one knows when those visions occurred or where. Dr. Alexander wants to believe -- and wants everyone to believe -- they occurred out of his body and out of his mind.  I started the book with an open mind of my own. But in some of the first pages, when I read his statement that \\"What I have to tell you is as important as anything anyone will ever tell you, and it's true,\\" I was struck a bit dumb by the enormous presumption of that claim.<br /><br />He also claims he \\"was allowed to die harder\\" than almost all near death experience subjects before him. How also would he know that? And how did he \\"die harder\\" when he did not die?<br /><br />This is a faith-based book. Dr. Alexander reports that God is love and God is everywhere. This is hardly breaking news in any community of faith. Maybe it was news to him.<br /><br />\\"Proof of Heaven\\" is an outrageous title for a book that has become quite the rage.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I tried a competitor's first (AT&T Locker) and when I tried this one, I found it very limited in what it does (saves only photos - no documents or music). I like having the ability to save multiple types of files on the cloud, but Amazon's app doesn't do it for me, so I deleted it.
B00913DPW2|3.0|I suppose I must not be as adept at these games as I thought I was, because I found The Haunt to be an exercise in frustration. The storyline and graphics were good, and I was very eager to play it. However, it was impossible for me to tell what I was supposed to do next, and I became frustrated at the need to move back and forth between so many different scenes to find all objects needed to solve some of the puzzles.  There seemed to be no hints available--perhaps my game did not load on my Kindle correctly. After I checked a walkthrough and discovered I was in fact doing what I was supposed to be doing, some puzzles still didn't open.  Plus, to completely drive me over the edge, I accidentally clicked the reset button and it didn't give a double-check prompt (you know, \\"are you sure you want to reset?\\").  Arrgh.  So all the work I'd done was undone, and I had to start over!<br />I have bought many hidden object games that I just loved, but this one is not one of them.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is an awesome app. I love being able to set different alarms for different days of the week. Plus the &quot;do math to snooze&quot; option makes sure I don't just hit snooze and go back to sleep.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|As much as I love watching movies, I almost get more excited about the Behind-The-Scenes features of the disc than the film itself. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of bonus content to be had on The Avengers. There are some short featurettes, and some basic CGI walkthroughs, but on such a huge film like this I want some David Fincher level of behind the scenes. Full-featured documentaries about the entire production, from start to finish. That's what I really go crazy for, and unfortunately that's not to be found here.<br /><br />Still, the movie is superb, and the transfer and audio quality are top-notch. Everything looks and sounds great.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|OMG- DEAB (drop everything and buy) I think backflip studios did awesome on this same with tribez that is my next request thanks :) ;)
B000RAD1LS|4.0|The book itself is great, one of my favorites.  The copy I received is not as pretty as the one in the picture.  I wanted a pretty book to display, so beware that you may not receive one that looks like this.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|I´m really happy about this vinyl. Increduble quality and came with a non-announcce bonus: a free digital copy of the album. Amazon is one of the best choices ever to buy vinyl on the Internet. I recomend!
0439813786|3.0|it failed alot of my expectations. i thought it would take me a long time to finish and i didnt think there where so many pictures covering the pages but it was still a good story. just wished i knew it was a short one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun for a free game but you run out of energy way to fast and there is really no way to earn more without spending actual money.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I think that the author captured the trauma experienced by children in the foster home and group care system and the impact that has on their ability to trust and establish relationships, but as the novel progressed I felt that the solutions were too pat and I became somewhat frustrated with the development of the plot and the denouement.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|It was sent directly to my grandson and he is loving it. Hi builds something everyday and is really having fun with it.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was NOT a disappointment as sometimes sequels can be...this one was better. I believe both will be classics, top see the top action guys in one movie. Gosh, they must have had a ball making it..GOOD SHOW<br />Will buy it on DVD
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|its good game but I gave it four stars because it sooo long to download but other than that its a excellent game.I would recommend it you just to wait a little longer than a usual game.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gilliam Flynn has become a new favorite author! I love all 3 of her books, and eagerly anticipate her next one. If you enjoy dark fiction you will love this book.
1594481717|3.0|\\"A Whole New Mind\\" by Daniel H. Pink is a good read for even those who are creatively challenged.  The book claims to explain why \\"Right-Briners Will Rule the Future\\", and Pink explains this concept well.  Pink's biggest arguement is that society is shifting from a place where left-brained workers are what is necessary, to more innovative and creative right-brainers.  He explains that this is because technology, or other countries are doing the left-brained work; in order to compete, we need to focus more on our right-brain.  The Right brain is not responsible for just creativeness, but also tasks such as recognizing emotion and interpertation-which is vital to our communication and daily functions.  Pink then goes through six themes through which we need to use and expand our right-brain: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning.<br />  Pink's argument is logical, and while I did not always agree completely, I certainly think he has a point.  Pink, I feel, stressed the importance of the right-brain over the left too much at times.  However, the tasks and jobs in our society today require more than just doing what is asked of you in order to be successful.  Success in society today is often because of new ideas and a willingness to find creative and logical solutions to problems.  I hope to use some of the tips and ideas that Pink gives in his book in my own life.  Overall, I enjoyed the book and found it enlightening.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Besides the fact that I loved the book (and wanted to read it before watching the movie), this was first time reading an eBook and it was a great experience. Buying from the Amazon store and getting the book on my Kindle app for iPad was a breeze!

030758836X|5.0|The fact that I like both characters in this book frightens me a bit.  Nick and Amy Elliot Dunn made me feel better about the minor drama's in my own marriage.  This book takes crazy to a whole new level!  Now that it's over I have to wonder \\"who will I be without Nick and Amy Elliot Dunn?\\"<br /><br />Great narration as well.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Probably the best self-published book I've ever read, and one of the best books I've read all year, and 2012 was a great year for fantasy.
0143120530|3.0|Interesting idea, but really boring to read. There is basically one idea the author gives to improve memory and keeps repeating it with pretty boring stories. I would only suggest this for the reader who is passionate about memory improvement.
B008QYT7DI|2.0|The entire book is made up of pictures. I mean, every single page is a picture, so none of the nice features of Kindle, like word lookup, will work. I understand that this book has a singular layout because of the drawings by the author, and that's likely the reason they turned the book into a set of pictures. But I think is dishonest not to stablish it clearly on the product description. I think is deceiving. Have I known this beforehand, I would have never bought this particular edition.
B0002O06NA|5.0|this album is great and I liked the fact it had a download for it so I could have it on my computer
B009B2VBWE|3.0|I hate to write a bad review for one of my favorite modern jazz artist but she really deserves a bad review.  I understand what she was trying to do but I don't think she was fully committed to this album or convinced that it would work.  The best way to describe this is empty.  It lacks conviction.  It sounds like she made the album solely due to contractual requirements.  There is no song that stands out for me and I probably will not listen to any of the songs again without it being due to the shuffle mode on the music player.  Maybe she's building up the anticipation for the next album where she'll hopefully return to the songs that made her a household name.<br /><br />*Update* I listened to the CD a few more times because I just can't believe that Ms. Krall could miss the mark so bad.  So I had to increase my rate from 2 to 3 stars.  There still seems to be a disconnect but maybe it's one of those CD that has to grow on you.  Nevertheless, I doubt this album will ever be considered on of her best if not one of her worse.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I am not usually into &#34;super girl&#34; type movies. However this one is quite different. This story was more about a person thrown into a bad situation, but chose to be themselves. The story was also very believable. A reflection of things that could happen in our future as a nation. This is a must see!!!!
B003F5WOEC|5.0|you get a poster, a CD and a LP what else could you ask for... and its a great sound
B007V65R54|5.0|This book is a fantastic and realistic look at the role predictions and forecasts play in our world, both good and not-so-good examples.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|When I first listened to this through the samples, I did not care for it. I took a chance an purchased it. I am glad I did. The samples do not do this CD justice. In order for you to appreciate this CD, you have to listen and follow the journey. This CD takes your from Old men dating young chics, to Missing a good friend, to Mob Gangsters having a toast. Get this, and take the journey!!!!
B00008O31I|4.0|the LP came in really good condition I haven't listened to it yet thats why I cant give it a full rating but knowing the black keys its pretty great
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I like literary fiction and watch PBS, but this is my guilty pleasure. I am into apocalypse themes, and this is one of the best. Human/human conflict is even more interesting than zombie/human conflicts. There are enough twists and turns and new characters to keep things interesting without overwhelming.
B005IQZB14|4.0|this was a very good read but perhaps not the best choice for our non-fiction book club. It was more like escapist fiction. I mean, this woman deserves an award for triumphing over her addictions and remaining sane. What an ordeal..on all counts, and i salute her. Definitely makes you laugh and cry and triumph with her.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If you are keen to find out more about yourself and  want to be ale to understand more about your loved ones. This will help you to relate to and understand others in a new way. Great book
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I read the book in anticipation of seeing the movie.  Both are great.  The book delves into the character's spirituality and into animal psychology and training much more than does the movie.  However, I enjoyed the movie's ending more, just because it wasn't so abrupt.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This book was very slow starting.  By the time the story gets moving, the book is almost finished.<br />Cornwell wrote better books in her early days.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I loooooove 1D! this CD has some of the best songs! I kind of wish I would of gotten the yearbook edition the songs are amazing :)
B008Y7EYSK|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  There is a lot of suspense which keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Daniel Radcliffe was convincing as a father and solicitor.  I would suggest to watch this movie during the day and not alone!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book must read! Cant wait for the movie I read the book twice it was that good great love story
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Incredible movie. Amazing end to an already amazing trilogy. It was worth the wait when it came out in theaters.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I cannot get the app to add any new cities and it does not even give me the proper information on LA, the default city. I am only out the $.49 but it is not even worth that or the time trying to work with it and removing it.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Whatever happened to him? Is this what getting old does? Only kidding he does a very good job on this CD.
0802136834|5.0|Henry VIII has always been in my mind. I recently went to London and actually bought this book in the Westminster Abbey gift shop. I watched the showtime  series \\"The Tudors\\" and fell in love with the story. This book was so good I didn't want to stop reading. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about Henry VIII and his six wives. I cannot stop telling people about Henry and the six wives.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This package contains 3 blockbuster movies, an artistic booklet and ultraviolet copies of the movie. All for less than $28.<br /><br />On top of it, package is top notch, just like the trilogy.
B008RTE08E|5.0|It was great watching it again after so many years . Most of it I had forgotten but it was fun seeing it again for the first time the second around. Well worth the price of admission
B007SGM084|2.0|This is nothing but porn in a book. Its so poorly written I don't understand how it got published. I gave it a chance and read the entire series but it was nothing but filth.
B00004XQ83|4.0|The album's great and works fine, but I was bummed to see a crack in the case. A minor issue, however this was a gift for somebody and that annoyed me.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|why can't you make a decent facebook app for the kindle fire? The newsfeed just spins  and spins. this seems to be a common complaint for quite a while.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy would be great reading for people of all ages.  It kept me glued to the sroty line and i'm over 60.
0425221806|3.0|Really wasn't impressed with the time it took to get this book, I didn't get it for almost a month and it was for a birthday present and he never got it till long after his birthday.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is really great.  Easy to use.  I love it .  Everyone should use it.<br />  Works great on the Kindle FIRE.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Fun and easy to play. The levels start out easy enough but get challenging as you progress. I really enjoyed the game balance.
0547884591|5.0|This book is beautiful! Not only can it sit on your coffee table and be admired, it can also be opened and used to vastly improve your life !
B009K0P10K|4.0|this show is by far one of the best with all of its twists and turns.  Love all of the drama and backstabbing that goes on!
B009P2JV2M|2.0|The book, of course, is outstanding. However the fact that an eBook that costs $33+ has no Table of Contents is absolutely inexcusable. Shame on you, Amazon.
B005Q2YE86|5.0|It's simply amazing. i can't put into words the joy i get from this music. I suggest all who get it to listen while walking through heavy rain. I think it only gets negative comments because weak minded people can't understand the deep complexity behind it. Brilliant and no matter what any one says, Inviolable.<br />P.S. before you cast your final vote, listen to at least one song 3 times.
B004FOA84A|2.0|Finished in less than an hour, good game, puzzles are not too challenging , graphics and game play are nice. Just way toooooo short for a dollar.
1439153663|5.0|The kitchen house is a well-told novel about the reality of the south and this book details the intimate details of lives intertwined.  The slaves had classes and snobbery just as their counterparts, the &#34;white&#34; property owners.  You will find yourself rooting for characters.  This is a very satisfying read.
B000W0IEII|5.0|Had book 2 & 3 needed this to complete my set. Came in very good condition, as described in listing
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Just bought the Born to Die - Paradise Edition and discovered that the three tracks not contained in the regular edition of Born to Die are missing???  This is very disappointing considering I already had Born to Die but picked up the CD for the three additional tracks.  Has anyone heard from Polydor regarding this issue? Great album even without the three tracks!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|channing tatum is hot, and this movie is amazing it's a must buy and a good treat for any woman
B009LRE040|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite Batman made from comics into big screen. Absolutely BEST...<br />if your a big fan of Batman get it....
0547884591|5.0|His books are always entertaining and informative. His ideas are so innovative and impressive to the point of disbelief and excitement. Not once have I read a chapter from 4 hour work week or 4 hour body and not felt extremely inspired to improve my lifestyle choices. Fully recommend getting this book to jump start positive change in your life.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've used this alarm for almost 2 years with Elair on my Incredible through ICS and several ROMs on my MAXX. The only time it has failed me is when my battery dies in the middle of the night. It has never forced close as another reviewer posted. It is definitely one of my top 5 apps. Awesome.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|i love the walking dead. I hope they continue with many more seasons. It did suck when they killed lori off :(
0345803485|1.0|I don't know which I hate more, the book, or myself for reading it. It's everything I thought it would be and more.  More immature, more annoying, more poorly written, more pedestrian, the list goes on and on. So why am I reading it? Someone gave it to me as a gift, and I just had to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Everyone knows it's best to write about something you know, everyone but this painfully obvious first time author. If you're going to write a novel set in the U.S, at least try to sound American, and if you don't know how, hire an editor who can. This book is a mess. The twenty one year old main character is supposed to be from Georgia, but she sounds like a crumpet eating old English auntie. All the characters sound vaguely British at times, in this country we say \\"um\\" when searching for words, not \\"er.\\" Oh man, don't get me started...<br /><br />So why am I so annoyed?  Because if you're going to write commercial schlock, at least write it well. Do your research, know the culture, the colloquialisms, the settings, the cities you're writing about. And try throwing in a few different adjectives and descriptive phrases once in awhile. The repetition is hilarious! If this book was a drinking game, we'd all be needing Christian Grey to hold our hair back while we vomit. And come on now, how many times can a girl bite her own lip without needing facial reconstructive surgery?<br /><br />I'm not a book snob by any means, it just amazes me that this runaway hit is such a lazy, sloppy effort.  But people don't buy it for the writing of course, it's the sex.  And the sex well...meh...it's a lot like the meal on an airplane.  Takes forever to get there, and when it finally does, what a disappointment. But you eat it anyway.  Everyone else is.
B003VIW8DK|2.0|Ordered what I believed was a new disc got a used copy with a damaged case...center anchor button inside case is in pieces, disc not able to be secured in case...Minor scratches on recording surface-poor quality representation of product!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This installment of the Reacher books seemed to drag a little but I still liked it. The bad guys were a little hard to sort out but Jack kicked butt in the end, as usual!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I like Mitch Albom.  He is creative and always makes<br />you ponder his message. I enjoyed how he mixed<br />reality with illusion or fantasy and kept you wondering<br />how he would tie it all together.  Would the hero win<br />out or fail despite his powers ?<br />I think this book would appeal to all ages 12 and up.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|My youngest adult daughter loves this game--I just get bored after a short while and ready to go on to something more stimulating.  And being 69 I am sure has something to do with it!
B008RYN44U|4.0|I really loved Gwen's new album. It def can't top Tragic Kingdom but I wasn't expecting it to. I love the CD. The songs are a little sad and negative, not too many fun light hearted songs, but ohh well. I still really love it!
B00005OWEG|5.0|I have the older version of this movie but this new version with extra is much better. I love this movie, Martin Sheen is incredible n it.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My son just purchased the G155 after basic training graduation.  He bought a new PS3 and needed a TV.  The BX had several TVs in the $200 price range, but they have to be locked up when not in use.  This created a storage problem.  He found the G155 at the BX and decided it would be an OK temporary solution.  He loves the setup.  It is sturdy and portable so he can take it to the community center where he can access the WiFi.  It is also small enough to fit in his secure storage locker when he is not in his room.  His buddies love it, too.  He lets them borrow it at times.  He said the monitor isextremely clear for both games and Blu Ray movies.  He plans on keeping his PS3 in the case and using the game system exclusively with the G155.  Thank you for making a product that is affordable, secure, and keeps my Airman busy when he is not in training.  He will definately use it this Christmas, since heis not coming home and will be staying on base with very few others around.
B008MM9630|5.0|I have it on my kindle and my galaxy two. I haven't paid real cash for anything on it and haven't found that it takes huge amounts of time to accomplish levels. Some games try try to hook you and then make it impossible to continue without purchasing items, so far I haven't had that issue.
0545265355|5.0|I was actually reading book 3, 20 minutes before I got married. I couldn't put these books down. Very interesting reading for all ages!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I got it for my grandson and he loves it!  He has all of the Angry Birds games so he does switch from one game to another.  He does not get bored playing Angry Birds!  First thing he looks for when he comes to Grandma's house.  Of course Grandma has to play also!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great movies.  Upgrading my movie collection to Blu-ray.  Big differance from dvd.  Picture quality as well as sound as amazing

140053271X|5.0|I just received this reader after returning a gifted Kindle.  Nice screen and seems much more white than the Kindle Touch I returned.  I did root it to run Android, so it tends to lag in apps that it was never meant to run, but in reader apps, it's great.  It also has a micro SD slot (32GB works fine) which is the main reason I chose it.  That and the fact that it is so easily rooted, with a large support community.  I liked the Kindle's sleek looks more than the Nook, but the screen on this is definitely better for reading (can't speak for the new Kindle Paper White).  I haven't read outdoors with it yet, so no info there.  Now I have a ton of ebooks and, more importantly, all my college text books in PDF format.  In fact now that it's rooted, I can read any format file by getting an app (including the Kindle app!).  Web browsing is okay with Opera mobile.  Email is great.  Video is not possible, but eink offer a couple of months of battery life (even a few weeks would be great) which makes up for any shortfalls.  I leave my laptop home most days now.  Bottom line: It's the perfect addition to the modern student's toolkit (If you've got a little technical know-how).

B0045HCJ9E|5.0|North By Northwest is an essential film for anyone who appreciates 20th century films by the masters. A sparkling script and a perfect cast create a period piece that transcends its era with the device of mistaken identity coupled with a chance romance sparking a series of events that are at once believable and improbable. Only Hitch could do this and few, if any, today could hope to match this classic.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Is there ever enough time? There are times you want time to fly and there are moments you wish would last forever.  This book takes you through all emotions...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Decided to read this after I saw the movie, and I really enjoyed it. I was a bit unsure at first with the whole diary entry format, but it's done effectively, and it's a great (albeit quick) read. 5 stars
B009B8YZKS|4.0|Love Halo game and Forward Unto Dawn is good stuff , not cheesy. The action and acting is good , it felt very new and refreshing show.
B00005V9HH|1.0|Not a great movie, bad direction, A waste of talent, not hard to figure out and Kevin Spacey is overrated as a actor, but fits for this generation of mindless drones. The subject of crime/ mystery / suspense is a great thing and there are much better movies out there to see. It's gets one star for the actors that were in it.  Terribly boring and disjointed.  How it gained so many awards is a mystery.  Didn't this director go on to direct \\" Apt Pupil\\"  another terrible film?!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazon video worked quite well with comparing to netflix. The layout on the ps3 app is a little confusing to get used too
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I bought this for my cousin as a gift.She has all the HBO season DVDS' already. Now she has the movies. She likes it. The item was shipped quickly. Recommends to others.

B003B02OOG|5.0|[[ASIN:B00AFIDYYG Traveling in The Slow Lane: Lessons Learned From Bus People and Adventures Traveling on the Road]]Honestly I have never read anything by John Grisham, but I have read bits and pieces of his work and enjoyed his movies. But when I saw his book of short stories entitled, \\"Ford County Stories,\\" I thought I would purchase the paperback and give Mr. Grisham a try. And man was I glad. He is an excellent storyteller, but of course Grisham fans know this. I could hardly put this book down. I could not wait to turn the next page to see what would happen. His characters are so colorful and unforgettable and so true to life. I mean, I felt like I have met so many of these characters because they are so life-like and like someone we have all met growing up or heard about. Grisham's characters are often so loving, so mean, so stupid, so brilliant and so funny and everything else in between. They are hilarious, moving, sometimes painful and or redemptive stories that will always entertain you and leave you thinking, praying or laughing. I highly recommend Ford County Stories. I only wish my book,<br />\\"Traveling in The Slow Lane Lessons Learned From Bus People and Adventures on the Road\\"<br />could be as good. But Grisham has inspired me to be a better writer and storyteller. And of course, to read more Grisham. I hope you will too.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought that the new diary of a simply kid was very good and one of the most funny books that I have read
030758836X|2.0|This book began so very strong, captivating, articulate and then 3/4 of the way through -BAM- I felt cheated, frustrated and duped.  By the time I finished, I was ready to throw my brand new ipad mini though my hotel window (luckily, I refrained).  No spoilers here, but be warned, is one of the worst endings ever written.  Gillian Flynn is a gifted author and I'm going to give her other books a go, but darn, if that ending didn't SUCK
1442337966|5.0|What can I say?  Only the best possible review.  I listen to The Power so many times.  Rhonda's voice and hers and her fans' life experiences lift me up.  I am so grateful she exists and that her destiny was to share The Secret as well as The Power to help so many millions of people round the world!  I don't know what I would do without this precious woman's wisdom and comforting voice.  I love this wonderful woman with all my heart!!!  Thank you Rhonda!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is a good and complicated story, with the usual scary stuff at the end, and depraved and stupid criminality.  The plot makes a super right-angle turn, and makes you wonder about why people can be led astray so easily, compounding mistakes into disasters.  The serialization of Bosch's life is always a bonus, as we see his daughter grow up, and observe probably the least interesting and most needy of his romantic interests.  We ladies who think about this kind of thing would love to have him dump the current one and I, for one, could come up with someone both appropriate and compelling with some positive baggage.  Like how about a jazz singer in a downtown club with indeterminate racial ancestry and a long grey braided ponytail, lots of bracelets, and a gracefully 55-year-old slim body and semi-hippie wardrobe?  She could teach Maddie how to cook and play guitar.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|First thing I check in the morning.  Although the full size page isn't , I still get all the postings and pictures.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Connelly is a wonderful writer, and these three stories are actually quite good.  Of course they don't have the breadth of an actual book, but as usual, you feel like you are riding along with the police.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Have played this game for years and was happy to find the free App  for it. Easy to play and enjoy.
B00008OWZC|5.0|After the release of Celebration Day, its great to go back to the seventies and listen to these guys rock and roll ......The video component is well worth the price and Jimmy Pages remastering made this a go back to cd for me.

B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Fun to play and a real brain teaser.<br />Computer does not compete with you so you can win games most of the time.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This is great--just wish there was a camera that took front and back both. A little awkard to use until you get used to it
B000PC6A3E|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said. This first movie of the trilogy is great. Great effort was made to really explore the Batman psyche. They explore what and how does a man become Batman. I don't think you saw Bruce Wayne in the Batman costume in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This more than made up for the previous Batman movies. As a Dark Knight fan I loved this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great Mahjong game.  I like all the different levels and the page that keeps track of your progress in solving.
B000H1RFKU|4.0|I like the way the movie slowly reveals Denzel's character's dark side. He goes from being a tough guy in the beginning to being a total psycho but the end of the movie. And the ride the take you on is crazy. Denzel Washington as usual does some great acting. Ethan Hawke's portrayal of a wet behind the ear narco is top notch. I love the cameo by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre also.
B004469BQA|5.0|I love all Joe's work. On this album premonition amd pyrrhic victoria stand out. If you are a Satch fan this is another musy have :)
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I can watch this movie 100 time over. One of comics oldest adversaries square off on the big screen. This movie would make Shakespeare stand and applaud while wiping a tear from his eye. It was just that well written, acted, and directed.
B00978V35C|4.0|Is a decent album. The more I listen the more it grows on me. Is definitely worth $10. Download was almost instant.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|One of the best first CD's I have ever heard. Every song is awesome. I look forward to years of follow-up music.
0812982622|5.0|This book lingered after I finished reading it.  You very easily get sucked into caring for the unbelievable yet believable life of Jun Do.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mr. Sanderson after reading his Mistborn series.  I have to admit that I didn't read all his books but this one piqued my interest because of the beautiful cover.  I wasn't disappointed.  From the start I was drawn into what seems like a doom ending for Shai.  Is is a thief but even a thief can be the best at what he/she does.  If you have a free night, give this a try.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my nephew...we are avid fans of this program and will have them to watch again and again after the last season ends...
B008764ZQ4|5.0|I didn't know if I was going to like the movie and the cast was a pretty wild mix. I really enjoyed the movie and this is one of the few times I have purchased a movie soundtrack. Excellent collection of music.
B00136Q1I0|5.0|If you like Bruce Springsteen or classic rock, this is a great album to buy. Since Springsteen has so many albums and popular songs, this compilation is a perfect blend of the best.
B003CSV7TK|1.0|I received a colorized version of the movie.  There was a black & white scene from the movie, depicted in the description and NOWHERE did it say it was a colorized version.  This is the first time Amazon disappointed me.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This story is engaging and well developed. Short stories sometimes suffer from flaws that would otherwise be solved by length. The Emperor's Soul does not. The protagonist and antagonist are both engaging and nuanced each with depth and humanity. The support characters may lack this depth, but they also lack the story time to be meaningful anyway; their task is to provide the backdrop for these two fascinating people to interact on two sides of a difficult issue.<br /><br />An excellent book.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|Really now, this got kind of far fetched.  The billions of dollars it would take to conceal such massive efforts of an isolated town where aging stops.  Escape thru the vents, man made killing animals, a little too out there for my interests.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Wes Anderson is my new favorite after watching this.  I would suggest watching Moonrise Kingdom if you like it—or really any of Anderson's films.  He has a very distinct style.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Had not read a John Grisham book in a while.  A good read.  Found that there were times when the story slowed a bit , but picked right back up and kept me interested to the end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have had no problems.  The app works great. It is so easy to use and is super practical. I love it.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Bought a new copy since the last one I bought was messed up. I have an annual “Chili and Grinchfest” with my friends, and I got this copy in perfect time for the event. No skipping whatsoever, thank goodness! Thank you very much! Jim Carrey’s The Grinch is my absolute favorite!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Lots of action , shoot 'em up bang bang and blow 'em up. Funny one liners from most of the stars. Good for renting but I would not purchase for a collection
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Great movie for fans of Firefly...or not. But if you like this then you will like Firefly and vice versa!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|One of the best stories I've ever read. So glad to have read it and then saw the movie. The movie stuck with it pretty close too. Great story with an awesome twist.
B0019IB0II|4.0|Really insightful- sorry for the pun. Since she is a scientist and a good writer, one learns a lot about brains and about &#34;recovery&#34; from injuries. It isn't so much a recovery as rebuilding one's life after a head injury.
B007SGM084|3.0|Everyone I talk to loved this book.  I am having a hard time getting into the story line, etc.  Hope to finish it one day.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Pixar lives up to its name once again. A great movie for a family with kids - especially a daughter!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My 4 yr old daughter loves this game. She get very excited when she has worked to unlock a new pet. I find myself doing tasks to get her closer to the next pet. The downfall, like with most games, they want you to spend money.
B004NS710C|4.0|Overall a good movie, had its highs - had its lows - based on a true story: I'm curious to know how true to the real story it really is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I began the first book of this trilogy I could not imagine how it would be called romance.  It was hot, erotica but the main character was so well written I cared what happened to her and wanted to find out.  The second book was less erotica and more of the romance nd the third book was a perfect blend of both.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I was very young when this was released. I loved it then and I still love it. I watched it again last weekend and enjoyed it as much as the first time I seen it. The actors were brilliant. Such a great storyline it was compelling to watch. Loved it and recommend it.
B009NCM248|5.0|I love Stone Sour. I only dislike one song on this CD. the one that sounds like Slipknot. I don't care for the growling voice on that song or on most of Slipknots songs, but I do love Stone Sour. Those boy's know how to rock.
B0030IIZ4M|3.0|My girls love this. It is played so often that I am thinking of buying another just so that I have a spare incase this dvd breaks! They are such big fans of Toy Story and for this is deserves 5 stars from me.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great item for the price.  It is just what was shown on the listing and i am real happy with the item. Thank you
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I absolutely love this Kindle cover. The color is bright, elastic  is holding securely, and the way it stands for viewing a movie is terrific!  Like I said, I love it!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great item for the money and i look forward to renting from Amazon in the near future. I wish i bought the item and did not just rent it.
0316228532|5.0|I enoy reading books by this author. Reminds me of the Harry Potter books but for adults. I'm glad I discovered these books.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|The same as i said above great product that everyone should buy.  Blue ray is the best quality so you can enjoy the movie better.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Deliciously written, I walked with Harold, cried with him and felt the swell of emotions so clearly described by Joyce.
B005HSL626|5.0|Keeps my 7 & 2 year entertained so I give it 5 stars. Not educational but I would say makes them focus on motor skills.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|I've never been a fan of greatest hits albums, I've always found those I buy to be disappointing for one reason or another, either because it feels like a random collection of songs and not a carefully crafted album (which to be fair, it is) or because I realize that the reason I'm buying it is because I don't own any of the albums by the band, then after listening to an album of all their songs, even their best ones, that their sound just doesn't interest me.<br /><br />This greatest hits album is the exception.  I've listened to it far more than any other greatest hits album I've owned and I really enjoy it.  Even though it is just a collection of hits, the album seems to flow more naturally than other greatest hits albums.  And then there's the fact that the Foo Fighters are an excellent band and I'm not really sure why I never bought any of their albums.  If you're at all interested in this album, you'll definitely enjoy it.
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|With the cast of characters in this movie, I had high hopes that it would be a great blockbuster.  Unfortunately the movie was just &#34;OK.&#34;
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My son who is 9 years old discovered this toy at school and loves this toy.  Great product! Would recommend it to anyone!
B0078XFYDA|5.0|I think my eight year old grandson could read and comprehend &#34;the universe&#34; from this book.  Dawkins brings many scientific truths into focus for the lay person.  It was very exciting to be able to grasp an atom, or a red shift and other things I thought were beyond my comprehension.  I do think he too easily dismisses the &#34;spiritual&#34; aspects of life.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is an entertaining game if you are bored and it can become addicting. It is free so I have no complaints about it.
B000FC10WU|4.0|As always Agatha Christies books are enjoyable.They provide good light reading with fun characters and plots.Have found her series books very pleasant.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Didn't think I'd be interested in a book about a girl with tattoos, but this has many twists and turns.  I was sorry when I finished.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|the perks of being a wallflower,<br />a most engaging book with an interesting story line - even though I am over 70 - I want to see the movie
B0013TTLDE|5.0|It is riveting.  Stirs your conscience in the issue of slavery.  A worthwhile read. You can almost be there, and smell the cooking.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|the racketeer,<br />john grisham at his best - all the novels by grisham, patterson, demille, baldacci, child, woods and connelly - I've been<br />reading for the past 12 years and it turns out that they are the most popular on Amazon.  The only new author that I<br />can add to the above list of my favourite authors is vince flynn.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. Great for the kids, especially when in a waiting room or on a road trip. Worth the download for sure.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I never get tired of his sarcasm and wit.  There's enough intrigue to keep things flowing.  The ending was just a hair underwhelming.
0547884591|5.0|It took me a few stabs to get into the 4 Hour Body but once I jived with the way Tim thinks I was hooked. I could jump around and delve into topics as needed. The table of contents at first made little sense to me until a light bulb went on. Its a hack. Same thing with the 4 hour Chef, this time I played along and enjoy the lesson. Another brilliant page turn of resources, ideas and lesson backed by in depth deconstruction. Fun times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an absorbing story. A look at a post-apocalyptic world that could all too easily be real...the parallels with America are unmistakable.
B009LRE040|5.0|I have trouble understanding Michael Cane at times, and also Bane... This would make me enjoy the movie even further.
B007REV4YI|1.0|I love all the Bond movies but this one is by far the worst cinamatically it is awesome.  However Bond has one mission in life to Win, Bond is not supposed to Lose.  Sure he killed the bad guy, but the bad guy still Won, Kamakazi sytle.  The Bad guy had a plan to steal secrets, Bond couldnt stop him.  Then release the secrets to draw out M.  Bond couldnt stop him. Then Kill M, and Bond coulndt stop him.  Sure he killed him but from the scene where he held the gun to both their heads and told her to pull the trigger we knew he was willing to die to see her dead.  and Bond again didnt stop him.  So after all the awesome stunts the bad guy completed his evil plan, and Bond just hung around till the end with out even recovering the Stolen secrets.
0307744434|4.0|I seldom read romance novels.  The Night Circus was a clue in a crossword I was doing and I became intrigued.  Although the author leaved much unexplained, maybe explanations aren't necessary.  Most stories concerning magic leave the explanations to the reader.  Though I have read few romances, I imagine most are not as dark and violent as The Night Circus.  SPOILER ALERT, characters meet violent ends in this story.  But, it all seems like a dream.
B003Y5H59C|5.0|This movie is a little twisted but it's wonderfully put together. Gyllenhaal and Spader are perfectly matched! I recommend this movie to anyone who understands the &#34;less than fairy tale&#34; side of life and anyone else who can attempt to be open-minded!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|love it..its really great so far and how sexy is arrow? i think most would enjoy this show for sure
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best made shows on television today.  In depth characters that you really care about, action packed plots, and nail-biting chills.  My daughter and I like to watch this in the dark to make it even scarier.
B007HACDLK|3.0|I like Mitch Rapp.  He has been very personal in all the stories.  Here though there are many other characters, and Mitch is pushed into the background for part of the story.  It seems to be a shorter novel.  However, it is good with mystery and a lot of action.  I recommend it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Bought all the seasons and just like the rest, this one shipped very promptly and came in perfect condition! Will continue to buy them from here!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to anyone whether you are a fan or not.  It is a great addition to my collection.  It arrived on time as promised.
B001PPGAJE|1.0|I got this while it was on sale and thought \\"hey what a great deal from cyber monday\\" but I ended up with only the special features disc, no movie. WTF?
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app every day. I didn't know at first that it has a calendar as well. Helps me keep track of things and stay organized
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|The first book in the Love at Stake series.  Likes the introduction to the characters that would make up future books.  Great fun.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I think this game is stupid and no fun but my four year old likes to try and play if you build it for him
B009A9EPLM|4.0|John Towner Williams celebrated his eightieth birthday back in February of 2012. During his long career [one must not forget that during the 1950s and early '60s he was active as a pianist in various jazz groupings. Many of his early recordings, which were released on the Bethlehem and Kapp record labels, are presently available for purchase on amazon]. Later on, he worked as a studio musician, performing the scores of such diverse composers as Daniele Amfitheatrof, Elmer Bernstein, George Duning, Bernard Herrmann, David Raksin and Franz Waxman, among others, on various Hollywood soundtracks.  Good training, indeed. Mr Williams' score for &#34;Lincoln&#34; is a noble effort on his part. His music, redolent of the period with a touch of Aaron Copland (to be expected for any film capturing the American spirit) in the employment of diatonic, wide intervals, is memorable. The performance by The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of America's finest ensembles, validates the recording.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great additions to Season 1 and Season 2 my husband and I both enjoyed this season. It has many ups and downs can't wait until Feb. for more to come out.
B002OSAT7U|5.0|There really is no excuse as to why it took me this long to purchase this album...there are so many good tracks on this its really a shame i found that out this late into its relaese...this can be considered one of if not his best work...do yourself a favor and get it now...
B007HACDLK|4.0|Not his best but Vince Flynn delivers another riveting Mitch Rapp novel.  Unlike other novels in the Rapp series, there were a couple story lines opened early in the novel that were never revisited and as a result, some potential payback situations for Mitch were missed.  There were a few other dead zones where I started to lose interest but overall, the Mitch Rapp fan will be entertained and, like me, will come back for the next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book; could not put it down.  Well-written and the twist in the story was so unexpected.  Looking forward to additional books from this author.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|There are many characters in this book, and at times I have to work to keep them straight; but I really like the series and am hooked on finding out what happens with the main players.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I read an exerpt in a magazine and could not wait to get the book to read the entire accounting of Ms. Strayed's experience.  It was superb from beginning to end.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This book kept me guessing right until the end. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of Nesbo's works.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|This was an OK movie...pretty predictable and not really as funny as I was hoping. I had a promotional credit and was home alone for the night, so I thought something 'chick flick-y' might have been worthwhile. I'd heard mixed reviews and I guess I should have considered them a bit more. This is, of course, very predictable for most of the characters....and that's kind of what you would expect. The problem for me was the lack of depth to the characters. A few felt a bit relatable but you don't see as much attention paid to them. This just wasn't as funny as I had hoped, and it's not really dramatic or meaningful enough to fit into another category.
B009ACK1AS|3.0|My Sony blu ray player told me immediately that this video only worked for type B players - I don't know what this means, but be forewarned! This is an amazing movie from my childhood and I couldn't wait to share it with my daughter and I have to return it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is much more fun and addicting than I was expecting. My little niece wanted to play and so I got it for her but find myself playing it quite a bit too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|so addictive. I have had so much fun with this game you have to get a stormie8 id then you can friend people!!!
B007STBUIW|5.0|Super clean image, great sound, wonderful featurettes detailing not only the creation of the movie, but also the restoration process.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I tried my brothers pair and just never ever wanted anything else. It's the most comfortable heaphones I've ever tried, dousnt burn your ears with heat and  best off all sounds like 7.1 surround sound. Give these headphones a try if you can afford them...logitech gives a great warranty and has always helped me. These truly are the only headphones for me, maybe for you to?
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy makes it seems all so real and you feel like you know all the characters! Thank you Tom, you are so good at telling a story!
0143034901|5.0|Looks like the author planned this tale a long time in his mind before turning to write it, thus making it a powerful solid, serious page turner, bearing a original plot carrying a complex structure, well-crafted twists, and smart turn of events, that most experienced readers would not dare to guess.<br />The author also achieved to merge the rich narrative featuring successful classical novels with the action packed suspense typically found in crime paperbacks. It is compelling, gripping and does not let the reader go
B007HACDLK|5.0|The worst thing about Vince Flynn books is they are not long enough!  Either that or I read them waaaaay tooo fast!  Great story!  Thanks Vince!  Can't wait for the next one!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If you've already played it you know it's fun!  A time waster if there ever was one.  Warning: Addictive!  Use caution!
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Mechanic 2011 if you werent aware is a remake of the Charles Bronson movie from the 1970s.Except it stars Statham as the same character he has played in Crank,Transporter,Killer Elite,Expendables.Yes it gets repetitive and he should at least change his accent and wardrobe,maybe ask Nic Cage for a wig.The movie is directed by action veteran Simon West.Simon West is known for Con Air and this summer's Expendables 2
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Great game...enjoy the puzzles and hidden objects to find. Try it free for several levels then if you really like the game like I do you can purchase directly from the Kindle Fire HD.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I LOVE this book, you can learn so much from it! Will be reading for a 2nd time bc it is one of those books you just have to read more than once to be able to absorb all the info..
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game to pass the time. Fun for all ages. Slight change to jump or slide at the right time or you crash and start over.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|What makes this book along with the 4-hour series, is the applicability of action that can be taken.<br /><br />Chef is same and even more: technique's, tools, etc..
B0063IH60K|3.0|Plays well much fun to play and has good finish when you win. Good game to have to fill up a little time.
076790592X|4.0|I've read several of Mitch Albom's novels, two of which I have purchased (well, I guess it's three now): The Five People You Meet in Heaven and The Time Keeper. For me, Tuesdays with Morrie felt to be on the same spectrum, so to speak. It wasn't super captivating, but it was captivating enough to keep me reading.<br /><br />This novel is obviously about Morrie and Mitch. It is centered around Mitch's relationship with Morrie, as well as the changes that come with death, both physically and mentally. Mitch is lead into a rediscovery of sorts, questioning the life he has made for himself. However, his spirit is revived when he meets with Morrie.<br /><br />A part of me feels as though this novel showed Morrie as a perfect being of sorts, but I suppose that's because Mitch sees Morrie as an individual to be admired. In retrospect, this admiration and respect for Morrie is a tad overwhelming, but understandable. You can feel the growth of Mitch's love for Morrie as you progress throughout the novel. Furthermore, the lessons Morrie teaches provide insight into today's society, as well as a revelation on how to keep personal values and individualism intact throughout one's life.<br /><br />Would I recommend this novel? I suppose so. Even though some of the things that Morrie teaches are things that people can easily say, reading the actual words is a reminder, and possibly, an inspiration to start a change for the better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Have enjoyed the previous seasons 1 & 2, looking forward to many more seasons.<br />The actors are great, the costumes & story line is the best.
145162607X|5.0|Another great read! I really enjoyed the perspective of Anne Neville. It was different and very engrossing. I previously knew nothing about the Plantagenets, and now I am obsessed :)
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Loved it. Read for my college English class and I'm glad we did, otherwise I might not have read it.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Alright. It's official. The infamous \\"Sophomore Slump\\" is a myth of the past. After Katy Perry's fantastic [[ASIN:B003L77TZI Teenage Dream]], Gaga's chart-topping [[ASIN:B004K4AUZW Born This Way (Special Edition)]], and now Ke$ha's Warrior, it appears that the music industry has learned from the past and started beefing up singers' and bands' second studio albums.<br /><br />The first thing Ke$ha fans will notice about Ke$ha's new album is that K$ has changed her sound quite a bit. In reading some interviews before the CD came out, the artist repeatedly cited \\"rock and roll\\" as one of her inspirations. Specifically, that she wanted to resurrect rock in the form of modern-day pop. And, weirdly enough, it appears that she has.<br /><br />The first two singles, released early, are good transitions from old K$ to new K$. \\"Die Young\\" and \\"C'mon\\", both fabulous tracks, have hints of the 70s Rock inspired sounds to come, but are blended with more familiar chants and sing-talks that the singer has been made famous because of.<br /><br />The album has three \\"types\\" of track: songs with this new rock-pop sound, shout-out songs, and slow songs.<br /><br />The Rock-Pop is best exemplified in \\"Only Wanna Dance with You\\", \\"Crazy Kids\\", \\"Warrior\\", and \\"All That Matters (Beautiful Life)\\". These songs are a strange fusion of old and new that works in an extremely strange way, a way that only someone like Ke$ha could make seem normal and awesome. In addition, her song \\"Thinking of You\\", which I'd say fits into this category, is basically a modern rendition of Avril Lavigne's fabulous \\"Sk8r Boy\\", and it works beautifully.<br /><br />A few of the songs on the CD are essentially done as shout-outs. Allusions to music of old, modern scandals, and even (weirdly) K$'s own life. \\"Gold Trans Am\\", \\"Dirty Love (feat. Iggy Pop)\\", and \\"Supernatural\\" fit into this category. \\"Gold Trans Am\\" is amazing, one big \\"thank you\\" to Lynard Skynard and great country rock bands like them. \\"Dirty Love\\" is, with the help of Iggy Pop, turned into one big Iggy Pop love fest, with a K$ twist. \\"Supernatural\\" is essentially about Ke$ha's experience with ghost sex, which is strange and funny and terifying all at the same time.<br /><br />The slow songs on this CD are probably the one disappointment. While overall good, none of them reach the same amazing quality of \\"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes\\" or \\"The Harold Song\\". \\"Wherever You Are\\" and \\"Wonderland\\" are standouts for me. \\"Love into Light\\"'s opening drum beat screams Phil Collins \\"In the Air Tonight\\", but it has this slow quality to it that really makes me want to put it in this category. The others are fine, but ultimately too similar for me to comment on them.<br /><br />In conclusion, Warrior is an excellent step-up from Ke$ha's debut album and her EP. It is mature, well-written, catchy, and exciting. Look forward to months of new K$ music videos and radio singles. Like, this might extend into summer.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />The entire CD<br /><br />LISTEN TO:<br />\\"Warrior\\"<br />\\"Die Young\\"<br />\\"Only Wanna Dance with You\\"<br />\\"Gold Trans Am\\"<br />\\"Thinking of You\\"ith the help of Iggy Pop, turned into one big Iggy Pop love fest, with a K$ twist. \\"Supernatural\\" is essentially about Ke$ha's experience with ghost sex, which is strange and funny and terifying all at the same time.<br /><br />The slow songs on this CD are probably the one disappointment.

0142000655|5.0|I am re-reading it for a book club, so moving through it at a fairly fast pace.  I wish I had the chance to slow down, because Steinbeck is an amazing writer.  He offers a lot, even outside of the plot line.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|In my humble opinion, \\"Skyfall\\" is one of the best of the Bond movie genre. Although we could sit around all day and argue who is closer to the image of Ian Fleming's Bond, the answer, hands down, is Sean Connery who combined innate elegance with cold-bloodedness while omitting any hint of effeteness.  Daniel Craig, on the other hand, is more of a thug in an expensive suit with none of the finer touches of upper class British gentrification but, really dearie, who cares?  Craig delivers so much hard-punching, cliff-hanging action that I, as a viewer, no longer mourn the loss of Connery half as much as I used to do.<br /><br />The Thomas Newman score to this movie presents music to accompany the raw action of the film.  There's nothing calming, or soothing, or hum-able about this album.  If you need to jack up your adrenaline for a rough day at the office, this is the music for you.<br /><br />On a lesser note, none of the wonderfully quirky sound bytes we've all become used to and look forward to from Thomas Newman are here either.  There are no Javanese percussives, no syncopated oddities, no refreshingly original sounds as there are in Newman's soundtracks for \\"Erin Brocovich\\" or \\"Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events.\\"  Nor are there any memorable melodies -- truly lovely pieces -- such as we heard in \\"American Beauty,\\" \\"How to Make an American Quilt\\" and \\"The Horse Whisperer.\\"<br /><br />I feel this soundtrack is entirely appropriate to the non-stop action of the movie, but a part of me misses the quirkiness that is Thomas Newman's hallmark.
0547884591|5.0|I should be up front and say that I am a fan of Tim's so I guess I could be considered bias. While I prefer his writings and discussions on 4HWW topics, this book is definitely worth the purchase. I'm definitely not finished yet, but from what I've read so far is really cool. I'm hoping to score a couple great Slow Carb meals and tackle conversational German. Also, his coverage on the Aeropress was dead on (I'm a self proclaimed coffee enthusiast).<br /><br />Thanks dude and keep up the good work.<br /><br />-Dave
B007FEZQF8|4.0|I had always wanted to read the Walking Dead series having watched the television series, but never had the time until now. I enjoyed the black and white panels and the story was very easy to get into. The story differs quite a bit here compared to the beginning of the tv series, but I really enjoyed the over the top goryness of the book so far. Rick is very naive and I can only imagine it will change from this point on. The mature rating definitely works for a book like this and look forward to the shenanigans in the future books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is well worth my spare time and long car trips! i would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the old west
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a very sad but honest story about a little girl who was robbed of her childhood. It kept my interest  and made me very angry with her kidnapper/molester/monster and also his wife. She has turned out to be a caring young women and mother who is trying to put her world back together and it seems like she will be successful .
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|What an excellent adult drama! It really does represent some long-time marriages. Some of the scenes were really funny, but be prepared for some tear-inducing scenes. Meryl Streep was very believable in this film. See it.
0062101897|5.0|This book has everything and is a must for any Harry Potter fan. I LOVE this book and would absolutely recommend it!
1400069289|4.0|I heard the author's interview on NPR and decided to check out the book from the library. I'm only halfway through it, but even if the last half of the book falls apart, this is still an excellent read.  It's not a \\"how-to\\" book; it delves into the science of habits and how the habit loop is formed and how it can be broken.  If you're looking purely for a \\"how-to\\" book you'll probably be disappointed.  But anyone who is inquisitive and favors scientific explanations for behaviors will appreciate this book.  There is an appendix that is titled \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas\\" so it's not purely theoretical.  I'm buying this book as this is one that will be read again and again.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. It makes me laugh every once in a while but it is still good.
0765365278|5.0|With the ending of Wheel of Time series is looming, I am very glad that Brandon Sanderson came up with a new series, The Stormlight Archive (Book 1 : The Way of Kings). The story is very well written, the characters are developed magnificently, and the plot promises of deep layers. Hopefully the next books will have a minimum quality as the first book. Brandon participation in writing the ending of Wheel of Time series seems has developed his skill for writing great saga. Can't wait for the future books. Thank you Brandon...and please don't forget to write the main plot and ending of the series, in case somebody has to continuing your great story.....
B008LC8TJI|4.0|I bought this for a 12 year old and was under the impression I was buying the edited version, no such luck. I'll have to hunt down another copy it seems but the music is pretty good regardless of the rating.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is the first time I have read this author and I am very glad I did. I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time finding stopping points. I would read another page and then a chapter and before I knew it I was at the end. Very good story loved the characters and the way the book progressed.
1419705849|5.0|Received it in a very timely manner....my 2nd grade grandson read it in a day and a half and did his reading fair project on it!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a scientist myself, who is also a committed Christian, I have, however, wondered about &#34;near death&#34; experiences. I was struck by the amount of science integral to the telling of the author's story and the almost unbelievable set of circumstances virtually eliminating &#34;other explanations&#34; for the author's extended near-death experience. I almost unable to put the book down before completing it. I highly recommend it to all who are searching for meaning in their lives.
0767817478|1.0|I saw the original Godzilla at the movie theater when I was in 8th grade.  It was Awesome!!  I loved scary movies; therefore, the monster Godzilla was frightening.  Raymond Burr as a reporter is great because he advances the plot as relays his emotions to his newspaper!!  Now, as far as the 1998 remake...THUMBS DOWN!!  There were more special effects and so forth, but this Godzilla is ridiculous.  It's like taking Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and redoing it.  BOO!!!HISS!!!  What a joke!  Anyone who loved the black and white original Godzilla should be disgusted with this version.  Excuse me, but Godzilla was the STAR of the original one.  It should have been left alone.
B0000X61UU|4.0|I bought this video because I had one about 15 years ago on VHS. It worked then and it is working now.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|So based on that I'm not sure how true to the comic book it is but I think the show is decent.  Steven Amell does a nice job as Arrow.  Why I don't give this 5 stars is because of the character Diggle.  The story around him is kind of awkward,  I get it that he doesn't want to be a sidekick and he's there to be the conscience of Arrow but I just don't feel this is being well executed, maybe it's suppose to be that way and in time it'll be more clear but for right now I don't see how this is a good part of the show.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I can't believe how addicting this game is. I just wish that the Kindle HD edition had the third section that is available on android phones.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Thought this was a crime/murder story.  It took way to long to actually have anything to do with the case.  This story was mostly a personal analysis of Dr. Scarpetta's life.  I would have to say this one was boring.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It only lets you see a few posts and then goes to a weird blue list.  This is my most utilized app and i wont be able to use it on my new kindle!!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is my favorite CD right now.  I looked forward to this offering since Phillip won AI.  I was pretty sure he would release music I would relate to.  This is really my kind of music,very easy to listen to with great guitar and beautiful meaningful lyrics.  Phil is the real deal.  I love that he writes most of his songs.  That means there is more where this came from.  Looking forward to more from Phil Phillips.  My favorite song is all of them!  Thank you Phillip.
B000001ELP|4.0|I bought the LP when it originally came out (they advertised it on TV - something that rock bands never do) and (predictably) found the album totally different from their previous works. In retrospect, and considering the previous 2 albums to this one: Dynasty (1979) and Unmasked (1980), it was obvious to even the most casual listener, that the band had abandoned their previous modus operandi of creating music. KISS was still KISS, but looking for a new direction. They already had all the money, women and fame they could ever want, but by then, between the comic books, toys, and thousand other licensed products that had nothing to do with a rock band and more to do with cartoons, they were in danger (or had already become in the rock and roll business) something of a joke, especially after the ill-advised \\"Kiss Meets The Phantom Of The Park\\" movie, produced by no other than Hannah-Barbera. However since they were still selling out stadiums, apparently no one thought of telling Simmons and Stanley (but especially Simmons) that no amount of money could buy them back the street credibility they were losing or had already lost. (Music from)The Elder was not the album that alienated many older Kiss fans. It was the last nail on the coffin, but not the cause of their demise. They had already been turned off by the cheesiness of the junk that bore the band's name, added to the \\"disco\\" hit \\"I was Made For Loving You\\" (1979) and the follow up album recorded in Canada and produced behind mountains of cocaine in the mixing console. If only they had mixed \\"Unmasked\\" as a rock album and not a glossy synthesizer production resembling The Human League, tempers would have abated. However with this record which is half a rock album (\\"The Oath\\" \\"Dark Light\\" Only You\\" \\"A World Without Heroes\\" Escape from the Island\\" \\"I\\"  ) and the other half a bad mix of Star Wars, Barry Manilow, a bad imitation of Iron Maiden, Abba and \\"You Light Up My Life\\" - it was considered to be the final insultby those fans who still had some hope something good would come of this. If the bad half of this album had been rejected, and the band written better, more rock oriented songs or instrumentals (think Queen doing the soundtrack of \\"Flash Gordon\\" - 1980) they would have had a winner here. A more mature rock album that would bring back the old fans and attract new listeners who worship Steely Dan. Instead the equally addled; one by drugs, and the other by greed: Bob Ezrin and Gene Simmons - couldn't wait to get the product out the door. Damn the cheesiness, the non-existent story, unlearned lessons from past failures, the often wrong but sometimes right howls of disgust from music critics and hardcore fans alike, Ace's loud and clear opposition to the stupidity of the project...GET THEM TRUCKLOADS OF RECORDS OUT TO THE WAITING MASSES PRONTO!! It was Ace who put it best: These are not bad songs. These are just not songs for Kiss. And it was cowardly and cheap of Simmons to disavow the album completely. Whatever Simmons says, Stanley implicitly supports. Peter was out of the band by then. - I've always had a soft spot for Ace as I equate him with George Harrison - who was always suppressed by the hit making duo of Lennon & McCartney - until he had a chance to record an album of his own, which proved to be at least as good, if not vastly superior than the product his former suppressors put out at that time (Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and Frehley's 1978 solo album). Think of \\"The Elder\\" as the equivalent of \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\". Accept the album for what it is, and embrace the good parts, while rejecting the bad. If anything, it served as a wake up call to Simmons and Stanley to quit appeasing the drug addicts in the production room and get back to making rock records. Though port \\"Elder\\" albums never brought them the fortune they once made with their earlier albums, they still remained a strong attraction as long as they played the old favorites and they still put out one hell of a show.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, Vince Flynn does not disappoint the reader.  Mitch Rapp comes to life with all of his experiences and confrontations,  and Flynn has the ability to entrench the reader in each instance.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|Not to sound like a grumpy vinyl audiophile snob with a stick up my rectum, BUT...  \\"Zero\\" happens to be a loud sounding song that was improperly remixed by Corgan and Flood in which the remix lacks the \\"punchiness yet warmth\\" of the castrato choir and the Chic-based grooves. The backing vocal tracks featuring Tupak Shakur and Ringo Starr are missing, but if you listened to the original HUT LP release I paid $1200- (used) from a popular auction site you'd hear how much Amazon buyers and hardcore SP fans have been ripped off by this release. The packaging and the presentation are beautiful, as well as the mastering, except for \\"Zero\\" and that's why I will give this album ZERO stars and I hate the recording industry, and I hate CDs, and I hate Billy Corgan, and if you don;t agree with me you can all go to hell. - I had a similar beef with the vinyl re-release of Dark Side Of The Moon, and I totally loathe the 2009 Beatles CD releases as they lack the analog warmth, which are present beneath the tons of scuffs and crinkles and pops from 1960s Crapitol releases.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I guess like a lot of people we had great expectations about this highly hyped and anticipated movie,  I Found it very well made, it answered various hanging quetions from the original movie as usual I enjoy Noomi Rapace's acting, I do recommend this movie if you like the rest of the ALIEN movies! !!!!
1480054542|5.0|Finding Pride is a book that kept me wanting more, I was unable to put the book down.<br />The second book could not come any sooner, I will for sure be purchasing it as soon as it's available.<br /><br />Thank you to the Author for sharing this with me
B009NF54ZE|3.0|If this is a mystery game where is the mystery? It is not a challenging game but the humor is nice between the characters. Nice graphics but I found it to be boring.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|The best drama series I have seen in a very long time. It was hard to stop watching between episodes.Looking forward to the second season.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|For history buffs, this is the entire history of Great Britain told from a unique viewpoint that will add a great deal of perspective to other historical works on the subject. Very enjoyable.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This product is a bit larger than I anticipated, and a bit cheaper. Almost exclusively plastic parts, but doesn't diminish the fun you can have from it! I would rate 4 stars, nice packaging (for collectors), comes with detailed instructions & a replaceable ink for the pen attachment. Really wish they'd make a more durable die-cast version of this model.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|What a story. Jaycee's story made me mad, sad and inspired. Jaycee's has a ton of courage both during her captivity and now.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|As with the 4 Hour Chef, this book is very nice but all the recipes in the book use special cookware.
B003R0MF1W|4.0|I continue enjoying this show. It is predictable in many ways but strikes a balance with suspense.I like additional characters and replacements.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|This is an artist that never disappoints. The pieces on this album are musically perfect. The images drawn by his lyrics inspire introspective thinking regarding issues raised in every day life. Excellent. He should be honored with the title of \\"Poet Laureate\\" based on his work over the past 50 years.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn has his characters doing amazing things in extraordinary circumstance but which are probably my very true and real. Always look forward to Mitch in action.
B007MAETA8|2.0|I found it to be unoriginal and boring.  Sounded like it was aimed at the unsophisticated listener. Nothing about it was special.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The BEST series I've read!!! Absolutely love them all!! You get lost in the story and are always left wanting more! ....
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Can't play because I have to BUY more BINGO BLITZ to play. Not going to do that. Not getting anything out of it so why do we have to pay for enjoyment...
0062103377|5.0|Love this book everything Supernatural. I think this is a great book for all who love the T.V. show Supernatural.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is a fun read but drags out a little.  Would recommend to someone looking for a casual read.  The story is revealed in a trot vs a gallop.  Enjoyed it lots...
0062073192|5.0|Love this book and everything Supernatural. I think this is a great book for all who love the T.V. show Supernatural.
0061655554|5.0|This should be mandatory reading for anyone working or planning to work in Finance. It is an important book both from a historical point of view, since it speaks of the great LBO/Junk bonds period of the 80's and its actors, as much as a guide into the world of corporate take overs and Finance in general. It speaks of social ascension, multi billion dollar deals, oversized egos, betrayal, greed - the whole cocktail.<br />One thing that amazed me about this book is the amount of details and the diversity of characters that the authors have covered - it is so detailed at times that it almost feels like you are there, in the negotiation rooms, with the bankers and the CEOs.<br />That said I found the first part of the book more interesting than the second for the breadth of the subjects covered and the historical flashbacks. The first part is also more fast paced, giving it the top notch over the second in my humble opinion.<br />At almost 600 pages - and very small prints - this book is no quick read, but it will no doubt pay out personally and in your career to read this book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordins books keep getting better including his endings. Also its great how he switches<br /> characters and it is great how he adds new characters in these books. Overall i cant wait for the next book.
0393338827|5.0|The Big Short is a well written, provocative and intelligent book that opened my eyes on the reasons that led to the greatest financial crisis in history, also known as the credit crunch, and shaped the financial world as we know it today. No amount of news articles, academic papers and economic textbooks helped me make sense of the madness that brought the financial markets down in 2008 better than this book has. This book left me with a feeling that can be summarised best in one word: enlightenment.<br /><br />Michael Lewis is an incredibly talented author who knows what he talks about and writes with his heart. This is financial story-telling at its best. Thank you Mr Lewis
B005NJU8PA|5.0|More of the same. Always a good read and thought provoking. Lot of sense here. Great for dipping in on the loo.
B003REEPJS|4.0|If it wasn't for the two official singles, I would have rated Can't be Tamed five stars.  Can't be Tamed is catchy and well produced, but the lyrics make Miley seem conceited, while Who Owns My Heart is a little bland and confusing.  Anyways, I actually enjoyed the other songs much better.  Stay and Two More Lonely People sounds heartfelt.  Robot makes me think she is rebelling in a healthy way.  Most of all, Miley is a dominant songwriter on this album, which is pretty refreshing.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not as good as the first one for me personally. But two books in I may as well finish get to the third. Alot more adult that the Fifty shades book. You can tell the difference between a season author versus a new author right away in the writing styles.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|Demi seems to have a bit of an identity crisis with this album, despite having good songwriters and beautiful instrumentals with the songs.  Skyscraper, Unbroken, and For the Love of a Daughter are beautiful songs, but are unbalanced with the amount of party songs.  This album had the potential to almost be like Britney Spears' Blackout, considering both albums had great songwriters on both albums and both singers were going through similar issues at the time.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A disturbing, but thought-provoking novel that never bores.  Twists at the end are unpredictable.  This book does not leave you for many weeks.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was a page turner and I literally could not stop reading it. So many twists and turns in the plot! Now that I'm finished, I need to look into more books by Kate Morton. I would highly recommend it!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I thought the plot was slow to develop. After the story developed, there were many twists and turns I did not expect.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I know that this wasn't supposed to be another Harry Potter book, but this was so incredibly dull. I can't believe that J.K Rowling wrote this! I'm not sure how I forced myself to finish, but I did. It was painful.
B009X00E18|5.0|Before this case I had purchased a CaseCrown Ridge Standby Case.  While the quality and protection that case offered was top notch, the bulk it added to the slim Kindle was a bit much.  What I personally needed was a light-weight low bulk case for normal everyday usage protection (meaning bumps and scratches).  This fits my needs perfectly.<br /><br />The video included within the product description does this case some justice.  Installation is as simple as sliding the item in, and pushing two corners.  Contrary to other reviewers, I don't find the feel 'cheap' at all.  The backing has a nice rubberized texture.  The cover, to me, does not seem like 'cardboard.'  It feels like a thicker rubber lining with a felt inside.  Eveything seems high quality.  Even the elastic band feels solid, not flimsy.<br /><br />The case itself adds virtually no bulk or weight.  This is great.  The CaseCrown case made the Kindle HUGE feeling.  Not so here.  It still feels like I am holding my thin and light Kindle.  The stand works exactly as you'd expect.  I've used it quite a bit both on a flat surface and on my lap.  On a flat surface it sat very well during usage, with little to no wobbling.  On the lap, it was mostly managable.  Obviously the portion holding it up is smaller, so it is optimal for more of a flat surface situation.<br /><br />This should protect great from normal bumps and scraps.  I don't worry tossing it on the shelf or table while it is in the case.  I don't think you'll have the best dropping protection, but that's really not what a case like this is made for.  This is an everyday usage case, not an Otterbox.  Know that going in.  The cover will slide a bit, even when held down with the elastic band, but screen exposure in my experience due to this was extremely minimal.<br /><br />My only mixed feelings are on the price.  Its a high price relative to cases out there.  But, cheaper alternatives will not give this custom of a fit and this minimal of bulk at thishigh of a quality.  Overall, I am quite happy.
B006LSZECO|1.0|How does this book get so many great reviews? It's so boring, the &#34;twists&#34; are so lame. I literally HATED all the characters and couldn't wait to just finish it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It is amazing! Their music is incredible, and I love what they do, and if you haven't seen any of their youtube videos, look them up! They are simply amazing!
B008KW43TE|5.0|Great album, great artist! I downloaded this after hearing 'Thinkin Bout You' on the radio, and I was definitely not disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I started the book and couldn't quite get into it.  I'm not a sci-fi fan, so it stretched my imagination a bit too far.  After we saw the video and talked to my daughter-in-law, I resumed the book and &#34;feasted&#34; on it.  Ready to devour the rest of the series.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Great Movie! I didn't know it was the first part to the Dark Knight Trilogy, I had seen the other 2 first and this one cleared up some confusions I had! Loved it!
B0043WHRWA|5.0|Wow - just found Castle a few months ago and love it. I can't wait to finish Season 3 & 4 - so I can start in on the current season.<br /><br />BTW - There are four &#34;Nicki Heat&#34; books that go along with the series.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I got to watch the show, that's a big plus.<br />However; I was watching on my tablet and when I tried to view in full screen, the screen went black. The sound was still working, but It was almost as if it just couldn't buffer the video.. When I hit back to return to the normal size, it had some color issues that went away after 10 or so second. The problem from there was, every few minutes a message would appear, while playing the show that said 'Internet is not responding and needs to close' 'Wait' or 'Ok'. Clicking wait allowed me to continue watching, but the message would reappear a few minutes later and I lost the ability to pause or fast forward/rewind. Stopping the show, closing the internet session and starting over fixed the message problem. Full screen, on the other hand,  never worked.<br />Quality left a lot to be desired, but I did not spring for the HD version. Get what you pay for I s'pose.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I've become a big fan of Ken Follett.  His work captures the history of a period while still being entertaining to read.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I bought my Kindle Fire to read pdfs for class, but was disappointed because, on its own, the Kindle did not always render scanned pdfs correctly (letters would be missing from words - sometimes you had to guess what the word said.)  I also could not annotate any pdfs on the Kindle.  This app helps me do both!<br /><br />RepliGo Reader not only renders all the pdfs correctly, but allows you to highlight, underline, write, and other types of annotation.  It helps you search terms throughout pdfs and can even read your pdfs to you (not perfectly, but still!)  The downsides to using this app are that it doesn't number pages using the document page numbers, which makes it hard to jump around in the document when your classmates are quoting from certain pages.  Unless the document has been created with OCR text recognition, you lose the ability to annotate, so access to Adobe Acrobat will be essential.<br /><br />Now that this app helps me use my Kindle for the reason I bought it, I feel so much better about my purchase.  I highly recommend it for students looking to read pdfs and save money on paper.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read all three books in the trilogy and found each more fascinating than the previous one. It is a fantastic storyline and the characters are people you come to care a great deal about. The movie of Book One is also extremely well-done and sticks closely to the books. And it's not just for teenagers, either!
B000SW16M6|4.0|The movie arrived on time.  It was at a reasonable price and was in a small box to prevent any damage.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again this was one I couldn't put down. Every bit as good, if not better than Vince Flynn's other books.
B005LAII08|5.0|This movie was excellent.  I pre-ordered the movie as my daughter could not wait to see it.  Going to the movies is outrageous, for our family of five it costs let to buy the combo packs.  Brave has enough action to keep a brother happy and the entire moving made my daughter smile and sing.
