B0024FADAQ|5.0|Grandkids absolutely LOVED it.  They want to watch it over and over.  Really a unique pre-Star Wars and pre-video game movie.  Yet simple enough without all the sex and violence in today's similar movies.  Safe for them to watch.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Rarely do I have as many mixed feelings and opinions after having seen The Dark Knight Rises. It felt epic. It was moving. It felt long. It worked well as a book-end to the trilogy. It felt forced.<br /><br />The performances were excellent. Anne Hathaway as Selena the Cat Woman. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake, Michael Caine, Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman and so on.<br /><br />The last 30 minutes were just fantastic, worth the previous two-plus hour wait. Better than the Batman Begins but fell short of Heath Ledger's Dark Knight (could that movie been as good without him?).<br /><br />Overall I think it suffered from being too grandiose by trying to do too much. The multiple acts didn't click together as they did in The Dark Knight. The suspension of disbelief was less \\"suspended\\" than utterly confounded ... how did Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) go from emaciated cripple to muscle-bound butt-kicker in one day?&lt;<br /><br />And the finale, while enjoyable, had so many twists and conveniences it would have made my head spin if I wasn't enjoying it so much.<br /><br />To be fair, I think the best way to judge The Dark Knight Rises is as an attempt to close an epic story-line with a focus on continuity between the three films, reinforcing Nolan's conflicting \\"hopeful nihilism\\" philosophy. I look forward to watching all three back-to-back to see his vision uninterrupted by tragic events and the passage of time.
1452110581|5.0|We got this book for a friend of ours that hates cats. I saw it and instantly thought he should have this book. I'm not sure if he found the humor in the gift or the poems. I thought it was great and the poems were actually funny.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Ridley Scott had a bar that was set very high for this semi-prequel to Alien. Scott does not disappoint. The result was a sweeping epic with fantastic visuals and an unexpected homage to the sci-fi genre. For the discerning eye, there were scenes that were reminiscent of Star Wars, Star Trek, 2001 - A Space Odyssey, Aliens, X-Files, The Thing, and probably a few more I didn't catch. The very first scene was surprising and thought provoking, and the last scene was the closest connection to Alien the movie presented, beyond the iconic images already shown in the previews.<br /><br />A very long but never boring adventure, it showcased the great acting talents of Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" trilogy and Michael Fassbender, the best android of the Alien films. Charlene Theron continues to amaze as the best \\"ice queen\\" in movies today.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. It stretches the bounds of believability in several areas. Why do two of the \\"scientists\\" freak out when seeing an \\"alien\\" corpse but have no problem confronting the live \\"thing\\" that would make most of us run for cover? Noomi Rapace has a scene that shows she can portray pain-in-action as good as Bruce Willis in Die Hard, but then has action sequences that suspend disbelief more than Willis running on tattered feet.<br /><br />You don't get the slow-paced, dread and suspense of the original Alien or Blade Runner. This has way more action, gore and crowd-pleasing scenes. But it is nonetheless a film that will become a most-see films for genre fans.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I found the book well researched and fairly well narrated.<br /><br />It was well worth my time in reading and gave me a slightly different perspective on the 16th President.
B000ID1J0E|3.0|Interesting to see Johnny Depp in a bizarro movie before Pirates of the Caribbean and a near reprisal (with hair) in The Rum Diary, but it would have been much more believable if he didn't have that cigarette holder in his mouth the entire movie (albeit an ironic critique, given the movie's overall plot/content). But any movie about Vegas, having been to Vegas so many times, makes one nostalgic regardless.
0765325950|5.0|Great finish to the greatest series in my lifetime. I started book 1 when I was 16 years old and just finished the final book at age 35. It still resonates now just as it did then. A truly encompassing literary work.
B0094M0P4G|5.0|I really love the musical talent showcased here.  Cher and Christina Aguillera are amazing.  Very fun.  I don't often buy movies, but this is a keeper.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A must read for anyone who has ever shared the life of a special friend. Heartfelt and comical. I couldn't put it down.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This Kindle Fire case comesin classic black color that is very elegant.  It is perfect for profesional people, especially if they have to match it with the rest of their accessories: laptop, cell phone and other gadgets.  It will not stand out and yet it will be handy to reach and carry around without attracting too much attention.<br /><br />Inside of the cover has re-enforced corner that will keep Kindle in place and prevent any scratches and damage.  I will be the first on to admit that I have Kindle cover for every occasion.  I like to switch them around.  But this one is my favorite.  It is classical and traditional and fits both my reading and fashion sensibilities.<br /><br />Great for gift giving or any other special occasion if you choose to make it a present for someone you know.
B008602KQI|5.0|actually one of the best films i have seen in a long long time my wife also thought it was great and she is not really a movie fan
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Such a great book! One of the best i read in a long time!<br />Looking forward to the last part.
B003L77GGK|5.0|supernatural season 6 is very good, but i sent it back because i already have this series ordered by mistake
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|it's great, I use it to read music for music downloads. I was lost without it the other day. Download it now!
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|could have been made allot better liam neeson was not up to par, and i really do hate cliff hangers
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Anyone old enough to be reading reviews on Amazon.com is likely familiar w/ the Indiana Jones movies & even more likely . . . they already have an opinion of these movies . . . I am no different and this experience hasn't swayed my opinion of the movies . . . that being said, I have the following feedback regarding my 'attempt' at purchasing this Blu-Ray set:<br /><br />1) There appears to be much criticism regarding the packaging of this product . . . and based on my experience w/ this product, I'd have to agree  . . . as it appears as though my first disc (Raiders) was in fact scratched/rubbed or in some way damaged in such a manner that the movie 'froze' on several occasions during the viewing.  So, this is one reason I'm returning this product as I won't purchase Blu-Rays in these card board casings that encourage rubbing on the information side of the disc.<br /><br />2) I realize that a movie released in 1981 and transferred to Blu-Ray format in recent years can not be expected to have the same quality as a movie being released today (say something like The Avengers).  However, even w/ some concessions in mind . . . I was still greatly disappointed w/ the quality of the transfer of the 1st movie . . . Granted, my knowledge of such matters is very limited; but I am a consumer & avid movie-goer . . . and I can tell you this first movie (Indiana Jones Raiders) greatly disappointed me.  Side Note: for those interested in my AV/HT chain; the following was my AV-setup used in watching this movie: Samsung 55C8000 LED TV; Oppo BP-103; Denon 4311ci & Paradigm Studio 100's 5.1 Surround Sound Speaker System.  Unlike &#34;The Raiders Of The Lost Ark&#34; . . . The Avengers was OUTSTANDING on my AV/HT system . . . & don't get me wrong; I'm not praising &#34;The Avengers&#34; as the 'end-all-be-all' . . . just trying to make a comparison for a frame of reference.<br /><br />3) The provider of this Blu Ray box set was CDImports.  I contacted CDImports regarding my displeasure w/ how long it took for this order to be received, processed & delivered (11 days) . . . trying to understand how such an order could take so long to process . . . and asking for understanding, they basically responded (robo-responded would be more accurate) w/ &#34;if you're not pleased w/ the service you've received; feel free to exercise your right to return your product.&#34; . . . Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that I was able to return this product  . . . but (IMO) the only thing worse than 'inflexible customer service' is 'customer service that isn't interested in process improvement' & responding thoughtfully to my inquiries. . .<br /><br />Anyway, I can't really offer feedback on the movies . . . as I don't believe my opinion on the movies would affect anyone's future intent to purchase this product; but hopefully, the above items will assist someone in making a more well informed purchasing decision.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Sheke w/ how long it took for this order to be received, processed & delivered (11 days) . . . trying to understand how such an order could take so long to process . . . and asking for understanding, they basically responded (robo-responded would be more accurate) w/ &#34;if you're not pleased w/ the service you've received; feel free to exercise your right to return your product.&#34; . . .

B009T3AE1Y|4.0|It's not an easy movie, but don't worry if you don't understand it. Just listen and watch.  Requires more than one viewing to fully appreciate.
B001IF252M|5.0|I bought a different connector that didn't work...this one does. Use it with a MAC Pro and second monitor. My son likes doing his studies with the option of the internet on one screen and his document on the other. Much more productive.
B005QI4TTY|5.0|I thought with the price being so low it was used, NOT!!!! CD is the BOMB! T-shirt is very well made(black). If you iron it, be careful with the gold lettering. EVERYTHING'S NICE. Got to me within days(it was Christmas-time). VERY PLEASED:-)
1439107955|3.0|The item was supposed to be brand new. The shipping was not as quick I expected it to be. The corners were dent and it was a Christmas present for my sister. It looked used.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Want to pass the time and work the brain, this is the best.  Can play for a minute or all day.
B00992CF6W|4.0|To be honest i love Minecraft. But seriously 7$ !!!! I dont spend that much money on apps! But still,  It is fun. Maybe if they lowered the price than i would be happy. I bought the full version but obe problem is that they dont have the same amount of blocks as they do on the XBOX.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I started out watching the first episode, and expecting to hate it.  Much to my surprise, I found that episode fascinating and really enjoyable.  So I watched some more of them.<br /><br />For months, I kept waiting for them to fall into some cliche, kept waiting to be disappointed so that I could write off the show.  However, the show has consistently delivered high quality: suspense, surprises, often humor, and an odd logic all its own.<br /><br />I recommend it highly, particularly if you enjoy a show that takes unexpected twists and turns.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game. My kids have me hooked on this game. I cant even work without playing it threw out the day. I recomend this to all my friends.Just don't like the pop up adds.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My granddaughter loves this game she likes taking care of animals. We recommend this for kids and adults. Have fun playing its great.
0307719774|5.0|Great product, inspirational, perfect for gift giving or for yourself. The book is sturdy, and is small enough to carry around.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Is Excelent, i can download any video, i just want it say that is excelent, i give 5 Stars.<br />I recomend it, tray it and you gonna See by yourself.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I'm a fan of both of the stars, but what kept me watching was the reality of the script. good show.
B0000DK4PO|1.0|The order came on time but when I tried to play it in my DVD player it wouldn't work. I tried a different DVD player  thinking it was just that one but the same thing happened. Each time an error message popped up saying wrong region. The disc was made for the UK and won't play in America.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This was a beautiful, cleverly written, heart- warming story that anyone would enjoy- even if you are not a dog  lover!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I was totally lost in this book.... couldn't put it down.  Sure held my attention.  Well written, this author is new to me and I really liked his style.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This is brilliant.  Even if you're not into snowboarding you cant fail to be impressed.  It was so good my friend stole it, and I've had to buy another copy.
111846446X|2.0|It had some information that I found useful, but it left a lot to the imagination. Not a good template for technical documentaion.<br /><br />Very extensive info about WHO designed it, WHAT it is, WHEN it was developed, WHERE to buy it, and some minor postulations of WHY you would buy it.<br /><br />HOW was almost completely absent from this book. This is why I bought the book. But in reality I could have just rummage through the website and gathered all the info found in the book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The author keeps you interested throughout the book, but the ending is a complete disappointment.  If you have time it's not a bad read, but I woulnd't make it your first choice.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great movie that gives you an inside look at the legendary Sound City studio. From the early days to today you get to see the highest highs and the lowest lows. If you consider yourself just a moderate music fan I think you will still be entertained throughout the movie.
0670026603|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy this book as much as I did,  albeit the tears. Could not put it down once I started it.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Rates up there with girl who plays with fire...May be better since there is actually an end. Very Much enjoyed!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series is an unexpected treasure.  I am totally enthralled with the story line and characters.  I feel as though they are a part of my family.  I love this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you get subway surfers then go on straight away and you will love it it will make you want to go on it all the time and you will get addictive to the game
0887431453|5.0|These work well with the preschool activities we do at our childcare! I got one for each kid! I recommend them for everyone!
1475972350|5.0|Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down!! It was a great murder mystery and I can't wait to read what's next for Max Larkin!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I started watching this because my wife wanted to watch. My thoughts were oh jeez another women done dirty. I was expecting another Lifetime network style show.<br /><br />OK, I was wrong and it is a well acted and they have some excellent writers with good dialogue.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it keeps me entertained and I love meeting other people horses and I love my own horse-!!!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|this was enjoyable, and finished the series off with a satisfying finale. Still wondered if her math skills remained after the injury.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love that the book goes into Katniss's head and explores her feelings, which were not clear in the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Grab a tissue...but don't give up. This is a wonderful story and insight into how animals must think. You will never look at your pet again without analyzing what they are thinking!
B005PK56TA|4.0|Jessica Lange makes this series worth watching.... she's amazing and carries both and show and season over some less then great show scripts
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show-this is a great way to catch up or review before season 3. If watching streaming video make sure all other computers etc.. using internet are turned off to eliminate constant buffering
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show. Strong characters, good acting, witty dialogue. Everything a good period piece should be. Looking forward to more seasons!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I have read a few Nicholas Sparks books and like most people I find his characters lacking in depth. This book is no exception. I found it difficult to become truly invested in the romance aspect of this story, but the suspense story was well paced and I found myself speed reading to get to the end. Sparks attempt to \\"get inside\\" the head of an abusive spouse was interesting and well done, I thought. Overall, a quick and satisfying read!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This was not Denzel's best performance, nor was it the best movie he has been it but it was pretty good. It's a great story, but the film could have been directed better. Also I would have liked to see some form of more post crash interplay between Denzel's character and the co-pilot. The scene where they met in the hospital was awkward and did not help the plot much.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I wanted so much to love this book. It had all the elements of a fantastic novel - great writing, unique characters, fantastic setting, but I really struggled to make it to the end. I loved how the auther wrote in present tense. This is so rare and refreshing for a fiction novel that I was immediately struck by the tone. As a longtime fan of Cirque Du Soleil, I thought the imagery was so similar but so much more fantastical and magical. I think the author lost me on the characters, though. I knew from the beginning that there was a star-crossed lovers theme, but it just didn't play out in a way that was remotely satisfying or engaging. If you appreciate great prose and imagery, you will likely love this book. If you are more interested in becoming emotionally invested in the characters, then you may want to pass.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is a show definitely worth seeing.. its fantastic, the character, the plot, the cast.  I am not a big fan of period drama, but i have to say that this definitely changed my mind.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app is the awesomest app EVER! You really should get it. It's a great app. It entertains me for 1 whole hour!! AMAZING!!!!!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I like this one, it pulls all the super-heros together and puts them in action. What else do you need? Its an action movie, not going to any academy awards here but that is not what this is about. The rental process was very easy. I don't have much time for movies and to set up and get this in on my blu-ray was quick and easy. I will rent here again
0345803485|5.0|I got this product very fast. Not only was the package shipped fast, but professionally as well. Bubble wrap was safely securing my book so that it could not be bent which I REALLY liked. There is nothing like a horribly bent book.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Everything about this movie is awesome! Acting, Story, Direction, etc. I am not sure what else to say, but watch it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great story.  Had me on the edge of my seat for the last half.  We can only hope our Government is better than that.<br />What a great hero.
071815780X|4.0|I watched the TV series and am always inspired by Mr. Oliver.  The book has a few more recipes than were covered in the TV series - but it is missing a reference to which episode the recipe is from (I manually went through the cookbook and noted in it which episode each recipe was from).<br /><br />As a US &#34;cousin&#34; I had no trouble making the metric conversions, and appropriate nuances such as courgettes in place of zucchini.<br /><br />But, as a mid-level cook, the recipes are not 15-minutes meals unless you've done the recipe many, many times.  I've done a few of the recipes several times and have it down to 30-45 minutes - not including watching the appropriate episode first for the extra tips.  But even at 45 minutes - that's good for me.  I've learned a lot about speeding up the cooking process from both the TV series and the book.<br /><br />I like that there is a lot of room in the margins for notes, and that there are a fair amount of fish & vegetarian recipes.<br /><br />Overall this is a good cookbook, and becomes a great cookbook when used with the TV series.  Also, the dealer who sent my book from the UK to the US was amazingly fast (7-10 days).
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Interesting twists and turns that make you think about how you spend yours  Enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down..
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Boring. Anticlimactic. Only redeeming quality is that Denzel is an awesome actor in ANYTHING that he does. I have yet to meet someone who enjoyed this movie.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Every married person should read it.  How well do you know your partner?  This book makes you ask that question.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is a very interesting sequel to Ender Game. More for adults and young adults than Enders Game is. The themes are more mature and sometimes it was kind of boring form my 10-13 crowd. (I have lots of kids!) Most enjoyable has been that it has sparked some great conversations with my family.
0385535139|3.0|I bought this because I am a fan of John Grisham and have enjoyed several of his books.  This one did not pull me into the story as his previous novels have.  There are better Grisham books available.  I suggest &#34;A Painted House&#34; if you're interested in one of his better non-legal crime novels.<br /><br />Packaging great, delivery prompt, seller A++
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It took me a while to get going on this, but once I made the commitment to read it I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This had more twists and turns in it. I never saw any of them coming. It held my attention and had me coming back for more.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app works very well. It takes up no extra battery when an alarm is set. You have a large veriaty on the alarm sounds/toons. Great App
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best sci-fi book I've read yet. Already purchased the full series and look forward to writing their reviews, so long as they're as spectacular as the first book.
0380807343|4.0|I saw the stop-motion film based on this book quite a few times in 2012, and read the book in 2013. This is one of the rare cases where I like the movie more than the book, but the book is still worthwhile and entertaining, and a quick read. I enjoy Neil Gaiman's (the author's) creativity and morbid theme regarding a \\"Beldam Other Mother\\", who reminds me of a devouring spider. She lures her dissatisfied and restless child/kid victims in with an illusory superior world, while pretending to be their better mother, and one of the only few distinct *initial* physical differences are her black button eyes. I like the provided humor of the Jones' downstairs neighbors, Ms. Spink and Ms. Forcible, and upstairs neighbor, Mr. Bobo. And of course, I am a huge fan of The Cat, whom is ultimately Coraline's protector and ally, even if he is aloof and sometimes sneering. I would recommend this book and the film for older children who are mature enough to realize it is imaginary and therefore won't find it disturbing, and to any adult who is looking for a diverting and easy read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|OMG! you can't live without this series.  It's better than Upstairs Downstairs.  Lovely to the bones.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.
0857897764|5.0|This is a great book! I couldn't stop reading it! I would defintley recommend it to be on your list of books to read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really addicting and I cant get enough of it!! Its like the horses are real. Th graphics are AWESOME! You should totally get the game!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|great sound tract and an awesome story. DW plays a fantastic role aqs the lead pilot.. I highly recommend this DVD
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this Bible on my laptop, tablet and smart phone.  It is so easy to navigate that I use it for Bible study groups, worship services and whenever
B004J64QSI|5.0|My daughters and I watched it together. We loved the cast and screen projection. It was also great to see the original cast that made an appearance at the end. We will watch this one again.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This study Bible is so full of information (maps, graphs, charts, etc) that I will never exhaust it.  It is easy to navigate
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I was surprised by what a page turner it was! Lots of laugh-out-loud moments too. Bourdain manages to share the good with the bad; not only about the restaurant biz, but about himself as well. His voice is authentic and interesting. Whether you're a fan of him or not, you gotta admit: no one tells a story quite like he does.
0425252868|5.0|A story too compelling to be fiction.  Characters that are so real that you identify with them, so human you both love and criticize them.  A historical novel of the horrors of war from two viewpoints, the allies and the axis.  A great movie waiting to be filmed.
1449415881|4.0|Made a nice gift for a Dilbert lover. Every so often I see a torn out page.  Share the humor!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I WOULD GET THIS GAME! It is so cool and it has new features like the zipline and the mining cart. If you start playing it then you cant stop.It is even better if you play it on a kindle or an i pad.
B0000691U1|5.0|Excellent piece by three great players.<br />Roach, Mingus and Ellington are superb on this recording. Their playing is brilliant and the CD quality is very good. If you're into &#34;real&#34; jazz from an era when players gigged in dark, smoke-filled clubs until sunrise, you might strongly consider adding this to your playlist.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I  love fantasy. Harry Potter, I have read every book way more than once and have seen every movie equally as manyh times<br /> Now Merlin. I love it. Now I am watching the 5th season on TV and of course will buy the DVDs when they come out. So wonderfull to watch witches and warlocks. whose is to say they don't exist. such a wonderful change from all the murder and mayhem on TV.<br />bobi horn
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for my mother in law she was very pleased with the condition and enjoys the movie very much :)
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I first heard of Tegan and Sara in 2009 on the Honda Civic Tour with Paramore, I can tell you now I am a bigger fan of Tegan and Sara. I love them so much. I have all of their albums, and DVDs sitting in my CD rack. On my computer I have 225 songs (some are live, some are demos).<br />So since 2011 I've been impatiently waitng for this album, well not really; actually I was looking forward to the \\"getting back to our roots\\" concept that they told us back then. Tegan and Sara between the release of Sainthood (2009) and Heartthrob had collaborated with many electronic based artist. Tegan sang along with Astronautailis (Canadian Hip-Hop Artist) in the song 'Contrails' off his 2011 album 'This Is Our Science' as most you know then last year they both collaborated with DJ Musician Morgan Page on his 2012 album \\"In The Air\\" in 2 songs: 'Body Work', and 'Video'. In 2009 Tegan and Sara before (or just around that time) the release of Sainthood Tegan and Sara collaborated with Tiesto: 'Feel it in My Bones' That was huge for them, and the first time doing something like that. That song is one of the most played of his, and among the popular.<br /><br />Because of these collaborations I wasn't really surprised by the album, I was blown away. I honestly recommend the whole entire album, your money will not be wasted at all. I am a HUGE fan of Tegan and Sara, They deserve this fame, and success so much. And I also recommed if you LOVED this album that you check out ALL of their albums as well. They're talented artist, they write their own music, and lyrics. Something that is becoming rare these days. Sara said in 2012 in the process of the album in Carpool Confessional Episode 2 she said: \\"My goal here is not to keep our fans, it's to surprise, entertain, and excite our fans -- All you can do in your artist is make music you think is fantastic, and if you lose people because they don't like it; they can always listen to our older records... You win some; you lose some.\\"<br /><br />Listen to the album in it's entirety before you buy it: on Tegan and Sara's SoundCloud: [...]<br />Also the MP3 Album is a GOOD price right now: $3.99. I'm just a fan of the CD's and Album Artwork.<br /><br />Lastly: I reccomend this album because Tegan and Sara have work their entire lives to get here, They've been writing music since they were born, but 'Tegan and Sara' is 18 years old this year. Since 1994 they've put their all in to the band. I reccomend this album because it's going to do some pretty big things next award season. They're amazing live too, so you can't beat that.<br /><br />If you are a new listener: Welcome to the club. If you are new and are obsessed and can't get enough let me tell you where to go from here:<br />Buy: Get Along (DVD/CD), Sainthood, I'll Take The Blame EP, The Con (DVD/CD), It's Not Fun, Don't Do It, So Jealous, If It Was You, This Business of Art, Under Feet Like Ours.<br /><br />Seek out: Emy Storey (The one who makes their merch, and album art), Red Tape, and Yellow Tape Demos.<br /><br />If you're having a hard time deciding to buy this or not.

I'm just a fan of the CD's and Album Artwork.    Lastly: I reccomend this album because Tegan and Sara have work their entire lives to get here, They've been writing music since they were born, but 'Tegan and Sara' is 18 years old this year. Since 1994 they've put their all in to the band. I reccomend this album because it's going to do some pretty big things next award season. They're amazing live too, so you can't beat that.

B00846F1YW|5.0|The game is fun and challenges your mind. Its fun to look for clues and find things that are out of place. If you like mystery movies/books this is the game for you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game. Little disappointed to have to buy it even though advertised as free. Still enjoyed the challenges the game presented.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Holder and Sky are the ultimate couple! The fact that he is her rock although he is dealing with his own set of problems is amazing. Colleen Hoover writes a beautiful love story and spins an awesome story. So glad I took the time. Some of that material was hard to read but the author weaves an intricate web around you that doesn't release you til the very end. This was one time I was sorry there wasn't a follow-up book.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This book caught my attention from the get go and it never disappointed. A well written, extraordinary tale. I will look for the Child 66 book right away
0525953728|4.0|A good book that seemed to give an accurate and corroborating depiction of what took place as well as a in-depth description of the training required to be a member of Team Six.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|Again, an excellent product and received in good shape.  Movie definitely highlighted many scenes that were not in the regular DVD.  My wish list for BD is getting longer.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a fun game. There were not many puzzles but lots of HO's.  Some objects were hard to find as they were so dark but the hint key helped you locate them. I do agree with others that this was a short game.  I would not pay 4.99 to play it.  I got it for the lesser price and it was worth that. Also I feel they rushed the ending. Overall a fun game.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I ordered this one and I also ordered the new version, unfortunately, I received the same movie with the different covers. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, however, I cannot comment on the the blu ray one with John Houseman because I did not get it, even though I paid for both.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Would be 5 stars if it had Closed Captions. The series is of the best quality in Science Fiction. The arcs make it hard not to just keep watching. If only Amazon would get with the program and start providing Closed Captions with their on line streaming.
B0058W74UY|2.0|Downloaded this to my Kindle Fire to resolve some video problems, but it did no good. I probably will uninstall it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This isn't really my first Stephen King book. I read his book about how to write and learned so much. 11/22/63 was compelling. I was completely hooked. My only complaint is about the language of some of the characters. In his book, On Writing, King explains that the dialogue has to be real. There is no way the female teacher in Texas used the language King gave her. I realize he wanted to make her sassy and tough, but it wasn't real. I still like the book very much.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game satisfies my children's desire to take care of.something, while also passing time in the car travelling. Its also a good semi-mindless game for me
B00005PJ6M|5.0|Bought this as a present for a family member.  This is a funny movie the whole family can watch and laugh together.
B0095P29EG|5.0|I never heard of Thor. I thought this was better than Spiderman and superman. Great superhero movie for everyone to see
B005Q1W10A|5.0|You asked me to return damaged disk which I did.  You sent a new one showed it as no charge.  But you charged my bank America Visa card for it.  BOTTOM LINE I now have to pay for damaged disk and the one you just recently sent. PLEASE INSTRUCT ME HOW TO CORRECT THIS ERROR.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hay  I loved this game I would like it if you made npc villages and generated more lava and already built caves and and a nether portal like on the 360 and pc
B004WR125O|3.0|See above see above see above see above see above see above- of come on really- I can't have just a couple words in the review?!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wouldn't put it passed Nicholas that he also read Elia Mircas book [[ASIN:3941769189 Julie's Passion Book 1: A Diary of Greed and Lust (Volume 1)]] and he judged that one the same way I did: just the opposite of Nicholas Sparks book. Sparks writes about romance and love, Mirca about the loss of all of that. What both books have in common is the unexpected twist at the end. Love it.
B004R1164C|4.0|The previews gave most of the movie away but it kept my attention the whole way threw. Would suggest to watch if you haven't seen before
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading the new book from Elia Mirca [[ASIN:3941769189 Julie's Passion Book 1: A Diary of Greed and Lust (Volume 1)]], which I finished shortly after 50 shades freed, I realized that there is a bunch of intelligent new erotic books on the market. One of those definitly is the 50 shades of grey trilogy. At the end of the book I was sad to read the word epilogue\\" indicating that no additional books are to be expected in the future.  The only books of a similar quality I ever encountered were from Anais Nin and Henry Miller (may be D.H. Lawrence). Hope to read more from Ana and Christian in the future.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was worried that being the second book, it may not be as exciting. But I felt it was more so than the first. Maybe because you knew the characters better and you were able to get in with the story.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great book, different and refreshing. Lets you know sometimes S*** happens to innocent people. A definete addition of a series of books that just got added to my list. Jack Reacher rocks.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who enjoys stories about the British uppercrust society.<br />The music score is lovely, the scenery is beautiful, and the acting is superb.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great mother daughter story for kids.  Brings a tear to my every time I see it.  My grandaughter loves it.
0307719774|4.0|I wish there was a little more room for answers, more than three lines, but it is for 5 years so your answers have to be concise. I guess. It is a god idea and fun. I think a teenage girl would really like it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I am a superhero nerd and loved it.  I know you comic book purists probably shredded this movie, but I enjoyed it for what it is.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Like many others I've told about this show, I was skeptical that I would get into it especially since the first episode is a bit on the slow side while we are introduced to the characters and setting. But, of course, like everyone else, I succumbed to the Downtown addiction.
B00846REIS|2.0|I've read several books like this one (50 Shades of Grey series, Gabriel's Inferno, and Gabriel's Rapture). While all of these books were ridiculous to me at many times, I still considered them to be fun to read (a guilty pleasure, if you will). This book, however, was just over the top. I did not care for the characters at all. No one was even the tiniest bit believable. Gideon's descriptions were especially annoying. I don't think there was a page in the book that did not refer in some way to how &#34;hard&#34; Gideon's body was. I honestly just got sick of hearing about it. I know he was supposed to be attractive, as all male leads in these types of books are, but after the millionth time the author talked about his abs, I wanted to put the book down and give up trying to find a narrative. He wasn't the only character that was too much. Everyone in this book was an exaggerated stereotype, and it was disgusting. Finally, I feel like nothing happened in this book. It was literally just sex. I read the whole book, hoping that something would happen eventually, but nothing did. I don't plan on reading any of the other books in this series.
B00BESJYAY|1.0|I simply do not have words to express how bad this movie is.  I was hoping for an epic surfing film, but what I got was one of the worst, most pedestrian screenplays ever committed to film.  The writers tried to make a human interest film, but none of the characters are in the least interesting.<br /><br />And the acting is simply awful.  John Weston, a newcomer to film, is possibly the worst young actor since Edward Furlong, while Gerard Butler turns in a performance that should be a career ender.<br /><br />The movie just drags and drags and drags.  The directing is horrible and even the cinematography, which should be central to a film about a giant wave, is pathetic.  This film gets 33% on RottenTomatoes, which is a far better rating than it deserves.<br /><br />Trust me: skip this turkey.  If you want to see a real surfing movie, rent Stacey Peralta's \\"Riding Giants\\".
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the first 007 film for my son, and He is enjoying the movie. We love it and we hope to see the future one coming soon.
B008458O3S|5.0|Entertaining and puzzling.  While the limited space, track changes and obstacles makes one think, the ability to set the speed helps.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Love it...Another Great book  I can not wait to see the movie, it should be another great one. Wonder what is next .
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Nice acting turn by Denzel Washington but this film drags on way too long. The movie opens with the usual gratuitous nude scene complete with drug and alcohol use-followed by an exciting and tense action sequence and then lapses into automatic pilot mode for the remainder of the two plus hours.<br /><br />Why do movies have to linger on in this way? Have the fast forward button handy- you won't miss much!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Choppy and repetitive writing, but overall intriguing book to read. Not often you come across a book like this. Wonder if a new series will emerge.
B0018OIK0E|1.0|After hearing how hilarious this movie was from several people, I finally watched it, and I just don't understand the hype about this movie. All of the characters were really annoying and by the end I wanted all of them to get eaten by zombies. I love comedies, but I just didn't think this was very funny. Shaun and his slob roommate are so dumb that they are unaware the zombie apocalypse is going on until days after it starts when there is a zombie in their yard. How would you be able to miss that, even if you don't watch the news? This could have been more entertaining if the characters were people you could root for instead of irritating slackers with few redeeming qualities and no common sense. Just not my cup of tea.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Everyone knows Bob is a God. He just is. So when I bought this three disc set virtually for $0.99, I have nothing but the best to say. This is an exemplary example of just who Marley was in music, and you just can't go wrong with this. I got it for a dollar back in the Christmas sales and it's probably one of the best dollars I've spent in my 19 years of living.
B00005JKDR|1.0|i did not get what i bought it said two disc i only got one an had no cover to it i only got one of the disc
B008KW43TE|5.0|Shut up, I know it's a cliche. But it's true. Frank Ocean is the new R. Kelly, with less baggage. Frank is a brilliant songwriter and vocalist and this album is nothing but perfect. Earl's appearance on &#34;Super Rich Kids&#34; is classic and Andre 3000 and John Mayer really do seal the album perfectly. This makes me more than excited to see what else will be coming from this man.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great read, as always Pendergast is very enjoyable!!!!<br />Preston and Child are always a great writing team.<br />I wait for every one of their books and devour them immediately.
B00A17AD36|5.0|The Weeknd is one of those break out bands that is definitely worth the attention but if you don't already know them, you may want to listen to their stuff before you buy it, as they aren't for everyone. BUT I bought this CD in the Christmas sale for $2 or $4 (can't remember). With a price like that on the first three albums from a band, why not take a little risk? And it paid off. I really enjoyed these albums, and as the title says, I'm still working through them all. But with iTunes charging .99 to 1.29 per song, my $4 was definitely a successful purchase.
B001YIJOI6|5.0|I purchased her most recent album before this one, love all the songs on both albums. On this one, I love Printemps.. Such a sweet voice with catchy music.
B004FQX59I|5.0|Loved this when I first saw it 20 or so years ago. Have it on video. I wanted a copy on DVD.
0811821846|5.0|Got this as a Valentine's day gift, the recipes seem really easy and fun, and my six year old loves to read the titles with me.  He laughs at every one of them.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I've used nature sounds to help me sleep in the past but u really liked that I could mix sounds together to create a custom sound and that I could set a timer, I was asleep in minutes!
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome Sim game<br />if you enjoy strategy games like Sim city or civilization this game is for.<br />very entertaining and little problems
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Fun and entertaining.  It's a good visual and mental workout.  The game records your best finishing time which is good in that it lets you see how good you are, but then, it shows you how bad you are when you try to beat that one killer score you got on that really good day.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Even as an adult, I think there are things you can learn from reading it.  I highly recommend it because it helps illustrate how you can make a difference simply by being kind.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I'm really enjoying playing Angry Birds Rio.  The graphics are so great....almost HD.  I don't get to play as much as I would like but when I do play I find myself totally immersed into the game.
B008518MOW|5.0|We have enjoyed this 3D Blu-ray disc immensely and have played it a number of times for our friends.  Very happy with this purchase.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Fantastic album! I highly recommend purchasing. Great harmony's from 3 great musicians!  I love every song!  Can't wait to see them in concert again - a really fun concert as they have so much fun on stage.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive. I like the fact that there are so many different levels.<br />I never get board. It keeps me busy and takes my mind off of the real world.
B005LAIHQS|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I found this installment in the MIB franchise probably to be the best one yet.  However, I hate seeing the dreaded \\"Ultraviolet\\" download.  While I understand trying to protect their product from piracy, obviously I purchased it, I'm not the bad guy, I paid for my copy and I should not have to download and additional app or program to use something that I paid for.  I figure if enough people leave bad reviews maybe it will change (it did for the Harry Potter followers)and the rant was worth the effort if it did.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Great animation, terrific characters, great storyline - what's not to like?  Kids loved it, but the storyline was more &#34;adult&#34;, and had some good &#34;double-entendres&#34; in it for me to pick up on during the &#34;slapstick&#34; routines - pretty funny stuff!  Worth watching for kids and adults alike...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great insight into Lincoln the person and how he lead the country through the Civil War with a cabinet made up primarily of his political rivals.  Amazing study of the various players, their motives, and how Lincoln managed all the egos involved.  A great book for the history buff, someone interested in management technique, or anyone who enjoys great historical writing.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|A wonderfully illustrated game that keeps my children and even me to some extent entertained.  I do enjoy that it takes problem solving skills to complete each level and there is no violence.  So they are learning problem solving skills and it is not winding them up, this is a game I would even let them play before bed as a treat without worries of them not getting to sleep afterwards!!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have been using Avast on all my computers for a long time and have been extremely happy with it....so when I bought a Kindle Fire, of course, I wanted it for that.  I was very pleased to see that there is a version for android products.  I wouldn't want to be without it.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A great time killer. It's easy to see why this is one of the most popular game apps out there!
0446547646|4.0|very touching, sentimental and true love. the author has his own way to describe the story with a suspense. this one is to be recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game that's both fun and one that really taxes your brain when you get to the higher levels.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a really interesting account that has helped me to sharpen my beliefs and understanding of the afterlife it's an easy read without all the woo woo stuff many of us are so Leary of.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game.  Like it very much . . . . .<br />.. . . . . . . . . . .
B007DIQC90|5.0|Great deal .... bought the CD for my daughter.... she loved it.....packaging was great...it came in a cardboard CD cover..not the usual plastic..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is my British Gone With The Wind! Maggie Smith is brilliant, as is the entire cast. We anxiously await Season 4.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|A lot of people have been bashing this movie, but me personally as a long time Superman fan since before I could walk, this movie was great! Brandon Routh reminded me so much of Christopher Reeve in so many ways and I really liked how this movie kept the original sound track and connected to Superman 2. Now yeah I know there's a 3 and 4, but this movie feels like the real Superman 3. I also liked Kevin Spacey's take on Lex Luthor, he did a really good job, he felt evil and I think if anybody was to take Gene Hackman's role, Spacey was the right pick. I don't get why the studios ditched a sequel for this movie and I think that Bryan Singer did a great job making his movie as a nod to Richard Donner's original vision! This is a great Superman movie for those who loved the Christopher Reeve movies and those who like the 80's feel of superhero movie. This is not a movie for those who are looking for a Dark Knight or Iron Man type of movie, so if you're looking for one of those kind of movies, skip it and also I recommend watching Superman 1 and 2 before watching this movie as well! It makes a lot more sense when you do it that way. If you don't like this movie and don't agree with my views on it, don't mind commenting, because I already know there's quite a lot of people who didn't care for this movie, but there are those who did and I am one of them! I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars and the only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because I would've liked to see a little bit more action, but really I'm not trippin about that at all.
B00418NVMQ|2.0|the earlier songs from Halestorm is a bit average but there new songs launched lately is brilliant.<br />would recommend there new stuff.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about this book and the twist at the end. A true story of survival and hope.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Love the show and the books!!! It was a great read! I finished it in 3 days! I love it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read it in a few days; thank heaven we were on vacation because I didn't get much else done. It's an intriguing read and keeps your interest. But the ending fell flat. I hope it's because there is a sequel; I gave it four stars with that in mind. If that was it, I'd give it three.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was the best love story I have read in  along time. So good<br /> It melts my heart to see someone transform because of one person. So good!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Excellent topics. Every song is perfect for every scene of the movie Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2. All are great. My favorite is All I've Ever Needed
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A most enjoyable book I would highly recommend it to any one who has not read it a good read
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the best of the series so far! So much action and suspense, you'll be on your toes the whole time!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This<br /><br /> is an ok book it's pretty good I'd read it but it's kind of a ripoff u can finish it in like three days
B007BVOEPI|5.0|...it is excellent entertainment. My friends are surprised I like the books. I explain it is similar to a combination of Star Wars and Dynasty set in medieval times. The book series gets a bit to meta-physical by #6 & #7 to be ideal but is still great fantasy writing. So far, the TV series is doing a good job of staying true though I think it would be better off spending less time on creating the setting and more on character development.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|What can I say.<br /><br />It was a standard dictionary that is taking up too much memory on my tablet.<br />Cisco
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|This Cd was young, upbeat and hopeful.  Just what the world needs.  There was no foul language and I sit with my great niece and listen to it.  One direction is going the right way.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Probably the best show on pay TV since Sopranos but not as meandering as that show; Characters are believable; Mandy Patinkin was fantastic
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|Mr. Mars is a seriously talented young man with a great voice and delivery.  Unfortunately he put so many f-bombs in the CD I would not be able to listen to his cd with my nieces and nephews and that tainted the music.  So in that respect I was dissappointed. However, the beat, the voice was great.  I especially liked the song &#34;When I was your man&#34;.  I would really like for Mr. Mars to just do a simple love song accomplied by a guitar and piano so show off his great vocals.  Here's Hoping!
B006UV8DJS|4.0|As little as I have played with this it is cool. Can't wait to learn all the ins and outs.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I went into this movie with anticipation of a dumbed down spoof. It was quite the opposite, and I have to say it may just be my favorite spoof of all time. I honestly think this movie did what a lot of movies of a \\"deeper\\" level try to get through to the viewers - don't overgeneralize! All hillbillies aren't killers, and things aren't always what they appear - get the details before assuming. I really loved this movie and it definitely made me laugh at some parts. It was able to get a few emotions out of me and will definitely be added to my favorite movies list. Well done to everyone involved with this film. I really enjoyed it!
B000VIPJKM|5.0|Great story and well done. I would watch this again. They want me to add more words. OK - watch this movie.
B0063IH60K|1.0|this product lets you play but never win what fun is that?  it is no fun to just go through the motions
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Yes, I read the reviews and decided to see it. I wasn't sorry. I didn't see Stallone's version but I could see how he could kill. The star, whoever he is (his head was covered I think throughout he movie), did a good job. I wish they would have toned down the violence a bit, but I guess that this is what you expect nowadays. The story was good.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season is also excellent, full of excitement. But for those like me, who weren't able to watch some episodes this was a great option. No advertising, no interruptions and a plus if u can't watch the whole episode at once, you will be able to keep on seeing it whenever u can. And you know that Supernatural, meaning Sam and Dean are worthy.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|The Rolling Stones have a TON of &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; compilations, but this is probably the best.  I bought the 3-CD version that digs a bit deeper than the 2 CD version.  It had all the hits I expected and lots of older stuff that I never even heard.  It's a easy way to skim off the cream of their catalog for a reasonable price.  It also made me want to go back a and re-listen to some of their full records.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app rocks! I had to delete and redownload it a few times cause it was glitching, but now it works great. WAY better than the original.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|This is probably the app I use the most. The word of the day, quote of the day, articles just to name a few springboards that I use for myself and my children. Great definitions, translations and links to more resources. There are not enough words to praise this Dictionary enough!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This game will keep you entertained for days. \\"Addictive\\" is an under statement. Share this one with your friends who enjoy challenges or logic games. They will thank you.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Ever once in a while it gets finnicky and wont respond or scroll. But other wise I'm very pleased to take pinterest with me wherever I go!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I'm still waiting on my Blu-ray copy to arrive, but I saw this movie in the theater and it was one of the best if not the best movie I saw last year.  I've never read the book, but I highly recommend this movie to anyone whether you've read it or not.  The characters seemed very real to me and made me wish I had friends like them in high school.<br /><br />Special Features<br /><br />Best Summer Ever Featurette: Basically about how all the actors became best friends during the shooting.  It was only 5 minutes long, but could have been longer in my opinion.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes and Dailies:  More interesting with the commentary on to hear why some things didn't make it into the film.<br /><br />Commentary with Stephen Chbosky:  Funny and heartfelt.  I thought this commentary was just as good as the movie itself.  Also talks about why the characters didn't know the song \\"We Could Be Heroes\\" and why seniors are befriending a freshman (which happened to me in high school by the way).<br /><br />Commentary with Stephen Chbosky and cast:  Funny but if you listened to the other commentary you won't get any new information from this.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I cried my eyes out, couldn't put it down. It was a fast read and I would highly recommend it!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Surprising and clever puzzle game.  It is kid friendly and challenging to adults as well.  Even after you make it through all the levels, you can go back and go for other achievements.
0062082353|5.0|I enjoyed this book for many reasons.  I liked that is was from Kyles point of view.  I enjoyed how he touched on all topics in his life.  The low reviews i dont understand.  If you read them, most are upset that it isnt percectly written. But i enjoy the way it is written you get the feeling that it was from his own mind.  Not some detached writer.  Anyway, great read.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel's performance is exceptional as a remarkable pilot who struggles with a very common problem.  A beautifully made film dealing with serious questions of moral choice and truth, this movie is not a light view.  Denzel's acting draws you into a virtual circle of disappointment, disgust, hope, and understanding in a way few have done dealing with this subject.  A strong recommendation.
B0080OK7YC|4.0|This was a special request from my 12 year old daughter. I think it is a good album. She plays it all the time on her Kindel fire.
076115678X|5.0|The book is very informative, gives a new method of caring for curly hair. I've been searching for years for a way to have this type of curls.
B002G917ZK|4.0|Haven't watched this in years and I was really surprised at the quality of the video and audio.  Haven't watched this in years, but it was well worth it.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The PCT has always been a wonder to me. I've been fortunate enough to have hiked small portions of it, only dreaming of what it would be like to find the courage to commit. Cheryl helped me realize the possibilities.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Really fine movie and superbly acted by Denzel.  I was surprised that most of the action took place at the beginning of the movie.  Well worth it.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|The second season of Sherlock puts the two leads in even more desperate situations.  Sherlock must deal with his rising fame, the promiscuous Irene Adler and of course his famous nemesis Moriarty.<br />The story will keep you on the edge and the acting is better than ever.  It may only be three episodes, but each one is of movie length and quality.  The writers pay wonderful homage to the original material as well as creating seamless original content.  The last few minutes will leave any fan breathless and begging for season 3.<br />The package itself is standard.  It contains two discs, one with the first two episodes and one with the finale and bonus features.  The features are an interesting watch, but not a major selling point on the set. Anyone who loved or enjoyed the first season should buy this set.  It meets and often exceeds the standard set in the first season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The beginning of this &#34;first book of the trilogy&#34; was a bit draggy for me.  However, after a couple of chapters I was hooked and read and reread this excellent tale.  On my first read I &#34;borrowed&#34; the book through Prime.  Now, a number of months later, I wanted to reread and have it at my disposal so I purchased.
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|Madonna has to be given the chutzpah award.  Not content to dodge the brickbats that she eludes for her musical and acting career  she has the audacity to assume the director's chair.  Credit where credit is due \\"W.E.\\", though not perfect, is a good movie.  It's a handsome looking production.  Most of the criticisms I've heard were how Madonna transports the action of the film from time and place in breakneck fashion at the expense of the story.  I will admit that initially this is jarring and headache inducing but after a while you get attuned to the rhythms of the film.  If there's any fault to be found it's in the story which Madonna co-wrote.  The film's central conceit of a cosmic connection between Wallis Duchess of Windsor(Andrea Riseborough) and Wally(Abbie Cornish), an unhappy New York psychiatrist's wife circa 1998 doesn't completely jibe.  Regardless, \\"W.E.\\" is an ambitious film and anybody who has reservations about it because it was helmed by a pop star should tuck such concerns away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its the best horse game I have on my kindle!!!!!!! it has great graphics and i just absolutely LOVE horses!!!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|All I can say is the story is very real, you relate to the different characters.  It shows the old English nobility, with more employees than one can comprehend.
B00AH69BPM|3.0|To continue my point: if you didn't enjoy Death Magnetic or don't feel a desire to collect all Metallica track releases, then you really don't need this.  The songs are just more of the same.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great series if you are into sci-fi or even if you aren't, because it is free with prime. It's one of the better ones on prime.
B004TI5N38|5.0|It was a great book.  The characters were interesting and believable.  The settings were described in such a way that I could picture them in my mind.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my 11 year old grand son greatly enjoyed playing it and kept him busy for several hours he will play with again next time we see him
B0085A9J18|5.0|If you can deal with the sub titles, this movie is one of the best karate fights movie since Bruce Lee.  I would highly recommend this movie to all karate movie lovers!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|HARRY POTTER. What else can I say? All 8 films for such a low price? I screamed in joy when I saw that it was so cheap. Once a Potterhead, always a Potterhead. :)
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Very addictive. Game is like diner dash. Very fun. Very addictive. Love it and is an easy way to pass the time.
0757302661|5.0|Hypnobirthing.  I know right?  Sounds... iffy.  But the information in this book is valid, and the techniques, when practiced and applied, DO work.  I used the methods outlined in this book through an induction and a natural labor with severe delivery complications.  Im eagerly anticipating using the methods again any day now.  Go ahead, be a skeptic.  But read the book.  Try it.  See for yourself.  Dont just take my word for it. :D
B004EPYZSK|5.0|arrived quickly, and in great condition.  this was a gift for my son and we viewed the movie together and we botth really liked it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Ho hum I was entertained for a few hours and then it became repetitious.  I was generous with three stars.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|i love this movie; watched it as a kid. Brought back so many memories. It arrived in quick timing as usual, no regrets!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ho hum I was entertained for a few hours and then it became repetitious.  I was generous with three stars.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|The entire album is great as is most of Josh's music, I  think I own every album he's released so far. Such a powerful voice.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I was using a Nostromo for several years, but it was finally getting worn out.  This was cheaper, has more keys, and a nice display screen.  The thing that sold me was the ability to create macros on the fly in game.  No need to alt tab the game, create your macro, then jump back to the game.  Some people complain it's uncomfortable, but for me, it's great.  Well worth it, especially if you can catch it on sale.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I related this DVD to a biblical story, the hero has a POWER INSIDE him that blasts forth when evil is near.  Evil activates his super power.  10 stars, this should be shown in every church in the world.<br />Believers have the HOLY SPIRIT living inside,  When Evil manifests. Gods power is released to crush evil/  10 stars.<br />No refeference to church or religon.  it is not about church on the surface, But it is deep..
B004J4WN0I|2.0|Alright, I gave this book a shot. It had a great premise, but the execution is just sloppy. Predictable writing, a protagonist that is pretty much a &#34;Mary Sue,&#34; and a heck of a lot of elements that seem to be heavily borrowed from other series. It's really clear from the get-go that this book is strongly influenced by the Dresden Files novels; unfortunately, the writer doesn't have the skill to pull it off, and the story falls flat. It's cluttered with dozens of supporting characters, none of whom are easy to care about. The dialogue is stilted and it's almost impossible to tell one character from another because they all talk the same.<br /><br />Really poor outing for this author. Sorry, Mr. Hearne, you're no Jim Butcher.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|DVD children and adults can watch with out foul language, or other hard topics, a good movie dvd, i liked it
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Not worth  you time to look at...I am surprised that Mark Wahlberg would be part of this movie...too gross, too crude
086571701X|5.0|This is an awsome book!  I'm almost done reading it and can't wait to start designing my own system. Easy read, well explained.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|If I need to waste ten minutes just waiting for someone this is a great game. It can get addicting.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is really cool and has more obstacles than the first temple run. The graffics make you feel like you are in the forest. The monsters are much cooler and instead of a bunch of monsters there is one really cool monster chasing you. I really enjoyed the first one but now I am hooked on the second!
B0040HERTY|5.0|Bruce Willis in the Die Hard series is a classic. I enjoyed the action and his humor, fun to watch.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|i feel suckered in because its only part of the game you can play! you have to pay more to get to other levels of the game:(
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|My son-in-law loves this movie but he needed to explain some of it to me...might be better watching the second time just to understand what is going on.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Judy Dench and Daniel Craig are brilliant! This is the most character driven of the Bond films and it still packs in all of the action you'd expect!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I thought the movie would be a lot better...I do enjoy watching Denzel Washington but the story line is a little too depressing.
158270208X|5.0|Enjoy journaling and this is a lovely little book with magnetic closure.  Nice size for travel, I am grateful for the Secret Gratitude Book, thank you!
B003U53GK8|5.0|Awesome! I didn't want it to end! Not sure I liked the ending :( did keep me guessing right till the very end
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's the best angry birds game yet but there could be so much more than just the main game and path of the Jedi right
1597772992|5.0|This book changed our lives. We met Dr. Campbell on a trip to Texas, and we were so impressed  by his intellectual approach and scientific background. This book helps straighten out all the confusing and contradictory health claims one hears on a daily basis about diet.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|good price, shipped promptly, nothing more to say, except this is rediculous that I am required to say anything in order to rate this product.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So smartly written and acted. It makes you wish that it would never end. It is FABULOUS entertainment. Can't wait to complete Season 3
B006WXHJGC|4.0|When I first saw this film at a theater, I hated it.<br />I don't know why. Maybe the story was too common, or maybe because of my condition that day.<br />When I watched it again in Bluray, I absolutly liked it.<br />The ending war sequence is really well made. It can be compare to any of Ridly's epic movies such as Gladiator, Kingdom of heaven.<br />I loved Cate Blanchett. She's never get old.<br />Russel Crow was well matched with the charactor. He always does.<br />The sound is well divided into 5 channels (DTS HD) and the picture is supurb.<br />Also it has two versions -Theatrical released one and unrated extend version.<br />Grab the bluray if you like this film.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Needs to be easier to send posts on people's walls and also to comment on things they have posted to us
B005D0RDO8|2.0|I saw this movie long long time ago.<br />I didn't felt disgusting. I have a strong stomach, so.<br />But I hated it.<br />There's no meaning I thought watching this film.<br />But anyway I am purchaging it.<br />You know why?<br />I donno.<br />I know what the pasism and all and can apply to this movie but still don't liked the film.<br />The picture quality is very good although my pirate version was good too.<br />IS it worth buying it? You decide.<br />PS: The picture quality is so so. It was not like sharp enough to say oh, it's HD.<br />The sound is mono one channel.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I found another calendar schdule app I liked much better.  This one was not very easy to get around in.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is so much fun with lots of great music. We have watched it over and over. You won't be disappointed.
B0016BKTQC|5.0|quick delivery and true to description from the seller. Of course, incredible album from the doors. I highly recommend it if you are a classic rock fan or just love jim morrison's style.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a very interesting true life story of a neurosurgeon who becomes very ill and has a near death experience. His story of survival is amazing and makes you realize how fragile life is. The end of the book gets too held up in medical facts and takes away from the essence of the story , which is a life after death
0307719774|5.0|If you are looking for a journal to write in to reflect on your day, this is not for you. If you want something quick and easy but also insightful, this is perfect.<br />I almost didn't buy this because of some reviews that commented on the small size. I'm glad I did anyway. The book is very small but doesn't bother me. I suppose if you are not able to write small you may not like this however I find it easy enough to write in and considering it is only meant to be a quick short answer the 4 lines provided seems fitting.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Must read...... could not put it down.....can't wait for the movie only two more days.... I hope the movie is close to the book..
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My favorite out of the trilogy!!! Loved how it ended...Didn't like the control issues so much in all 3 books.  It is a must read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the world the book took place in was thin because it lacked the presence of God.  But a  good story
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I thought that book two kept you involved in the plot.  It was getting harder and harder to put this book down because you didn't know what was going to happen next.  This was not my favorite but I still liked it.
0525953728|5.0|Amazing story written from the SEALS point of view.  Your heart will race from the very first line.  A must have.
B00110K62U|5.0|Received the CD of the movie track and could not compare it with this anniversary concert.  Also liked the 25th anniversary but was not happy with some of the singer/actors.  The 10th anniversary had it all.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Long anticipated by fans, Josh Groban's sixth studio album, All That Echoes, was released on Tuesday, February 5.<br /><br />Don't you love the title?  I won't say that Josh has been reading my blog, Wake of Echoes, but I will say that great minds think alike. I got my copy in the mail Monday (happy dance) and have since pretty much hijacked my husband's fancy stereo.<br /><br />When an artist has a fan base that ranges from tweens to great grandmas, there's always a chance that he'll begin to appeal to one end of that spectrum at the expense of the other - especially when new producers are involved, which has been true of both his fifth album, Illuminations (Rick Rubin), and All That Echoes (Rob Cavallo).<br /><br />But not to worry.  Josh is not a wedding singer, an opera wanna-be or a Vegas gonna-be.  He's not going to press an album every two years filled with easy-listening vanilla, just because it would sell.<br /><br />All That Echoes solidifies Josh's genius as a musician, not a crooner, though his voice is unparalleled. It pushes, explores and creates without alienating.  It draws on all of his strengths, with exquisite orchestration that compliments a voice more tuned to my ear every year.<br /><br />The title hints at its content - echoes of all that Josh has done before and all that we can expect in the future.  This long-time fan is excited to see it all unfold on tour soon.  (Please come back to Boise, Josh!)<br /><br />Here's my song-by-song review:<br /><br />BRAVE  -- Bright, genuine instrumentation.  The sunrise of All That Echoes, waking us to our potential.<br />\\"Brave\\" is the latest addition to a playlist of inspiration that began with \\"You're Still You\\" on Josh's self-titled debut, and peaked (no pun intended) with Closer's \\"You Raise Me Up,\\" which hit #1 on Billboard's Hot Adult Contemporary Chart in 2004.  The theme continued with \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\" on Awake and \\"Hidden Away\\" on Illuminations.  Josh never drops this touchstone ofhope that connects him most endearingly to his fans. (Groban/Salter/Kreviazuk)<br /><br />FALSE ALARMS  --  Letting go means accepting that part of you never will.<br />Josh convincingly moves to his higher register in \\"False Alarms,\\" creating a sense of musical openness that brings the lyrics to life.  (Groban/Mendez)<br /><br />FALLING SLOWLY -- Ah, Josh.  Take my hand and lead me down the midnight streets of Dublin.<br />\\"Falling Slowly\\" comes from the Tony-Award-winning Broadway Musical Once.  I'm dying to see it.  I would have liked to hear a little bit of harmony on this one, but I figure he was thinking: Jennifer likes to sing along in the car.  Thanks for leaving a place for me, Josh. (Hansard/Irglova)<br /><br />SHE MOVED THROUGH THE FAIR -- Gallant tones that make me want to hunt down the family tartan and take a breathless climb up to Dunguaire Castle.<br />This traditional Irish folk song is a perfect pick for Josh and reminiscent of similar favorites of mine, like \\"Molly Ban\\" by Alison Krauss and the Chieftains, and \\"Parting Glass\\" on Ed Sheeran's debut + (a hidden track after \\"Give Me Love\\").<br /><br />BELOW THE LINE -- Lively motivation to act from the heart.<br />Josh reminds us to \\"find our strength in love\\" in this vibrant call to consider the unfortunate in this world.  Musically, the message carries weight by paying homage to one of Josh's childhood favorites, Paul Simon's Graceland.  (Groban/Salter/Wilcox)<br /><br />E TI PROMETTERO -- If you think Italian songs carry the weight of rich lasagna, consider \\"E Ti Promettero\\" as a fresher dish.  I'm thinking Chicken Marsala.<br />Josh's voice is well complimented by Italian singer Laura Pausini - a perfect recipe.  And now I'm hungry. (Groban/Mendez/Salter/Marinangeli)<br /><br />THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS -- If \\"Brave\\" woke you up, \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" will tuck you in.<br />This cover (recorded decades ago by both Joe Cocker and Glen Campbell) demonstrates Josh's soft spot for sad songs, and is tonally similar to the beautiful \\"Galileo\\" on Illuminations.  The perfect voice and orchestration to illuminate loneliness. (Web)<br /><br />UN ALMA MAS -- Mmm.  ¡Que maravilla!<br />Close your eyes.  Okay, open them again.  You can't read with your eyes closed.  But imagine this:  Black and white film, a midcentury bandstand.  Josh and the band dressed in white suits with hair slicked back while dancers move across a marble floor.  Then the amazing Arturo Sandoval lifts his trumpet and begins to play along.  Stunning.  (Groban/Mendez/Salter/Brant)<br /><br />HAPPY IN MY HEARTACHE -- American.  Lemonade.  Grass between your toes.<br />This song is masculine and vulnerable, featuring Josh's signature piano work as well as a lovely little bit of acoustic guitar (played by producer Rob Cavallo).  Musically, it reminds me of \\"Simple Love\\" by Alison Krauss or maybe a nonspecific Don Williams song my parents listened to when I was a little kid. (Groban/Salter)<br /><br />HOLLOW TALK -- Echoes, shadows.  This song is. Just. So. Cool.<br />Originally performed and written by the Danish band, Choir of Young Believers, \\"Hollow Talk\\" has lyrics I don't understand and music that seeps into my bones.  Josh's interpretation replaces electronic orchestration with the real deal - and kicks it up with a haunting Zeppelin-esque interlude.  I can't wait to see it live. (Makrigiannis/Rhedin/Nordsoe)<br /><br />SINCERA -- Stolen kisses, secret letters, vine-covered towers, a balcony serenade. (Sigh).<br />Josh has recorded so many songs that should inspire men to mount steeds, storm castles and kiss their women as if there were no tomorrow.  (\\"Per Te\\" from Closer and \\"Straight to You\\" from Illuminations also come to mind).  Guys, seriously - let this song motivate you.  \\"Sincera\\" is now at the top of my swoon list.  Actually, it makes me want to plot novels in the Italian countryside.  (Groban/Afanasieff/Marinangeli)<br /><br />I BELIEVE (WHEN I FALL IN LOVE IT WILL BE FOREVER) -- A concert-ready, full-blown crescendo.<br />This Stevie Wonder-penned anthem has been waiting 40 years to meet Josh's vocal chords.  His cover is fresh, lively and hopeful with inspired emphasis on strings and a perfectly balanced choral arrangement. Fantastic. (Wonder/Wright)
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|Good solid James Taylor with old and new music.  Definitely would recommend to James Taylor fans for their Christmas collections.
B00846F1YW|4.0|It's a little repetitive, but it's fun. The game makes you want to find every item you can.  So enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well this series just get better. I think I could read this over and over again. It just pulls you in and makes it so you don't want to put the book down.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Useful necessity for the mathmatically challenged. It takes up the whole screen for the visually challenged also. No reader glasses needed!
B00BECZPI0|5.0|What can I say? It's a great Walking Dead episode! Loved it and love it! Can't wait for more episodes to be coming soon!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a great product for jotting down To Do List, grocery list, or thoughts for the day. Very useful and user friendly.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|That was a really good book. I loved all of it. There wasn't many parts where I thought it was really bad or better than everything else. It was great:{)
B008LY9AWG|3.0|I am not a great short story reader but this book is worth reading--Michael is always good he just has that touch so take time to read his stories
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Really like Joe Bonamassa. So far all his work has been great if you like blues and good guitar playing
B0035G5IOE|5.0|a great movie that my mother and i loved. we watched it on blu-ray at my house, then i watched it with my cousin at his house on dvd.<br /><br />the special features are really cool, they show how the stop action movie was made and they describe the process, and show the sets and character models.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to pass the time! Saves me from dying of boredom! Definitely recommend to others! Save your selves! Haha
B001AQR3JY|5.0|my wife love the lion king sometime in may ill will get her lion king 2 one of the best
0399160450|2.0|This is War and Peace all over again. First, the book is huge but not because it is full of sharp action. It is very verbose and conversational. The descriptions and thoughts are put on paper with ease. Second, the plot is just hard to believe. That I expect with the Bond books the this is different sort of writing and the ease of escapes and unbelievable plot twists just don't match the style.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|At times I even felt the movie wasted my time a little. I generally like denzel, but I feel like nothing in this movie really stands out like I was expecting given other reviews.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Classic story line, father/daughter, princess needs to get married off but wants her own way.  Nice to have the strong, capable, athletic, smart female lead.  Animation and color is fantastic.  Watchable again and again to pick up different detail each time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is a well put together series and requires your full attention, but well worth it.  Great buy and sad to hear they only did two seasons.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is way cool. It helps with you reflexes when it goes 100 miles faster! Whoever is looking at this don't think twice about getting this app. If you have temple run regular, well you would really like this because there are lots of activities you can do in the game.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Enjoyable. Love the types of puzzles.  It allows for a simple way to study the tiles and which one to chose.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|i have been a fan since the beginning, through all the changes.  I believe it to be one of the best on TV.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I absolutley love Jodi Picoult books and this one was no exception.  She makes you feel the characters joy as well as their pain.  This was a very sad and emotional story that was very well told.  So well, you can empathize with both the main characters.
B007IK44CK|3.0|There is good action in this movie and some fairly decent plot through out the movie.  The intelligence given to the characters is quite lacking for the world they live in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love it, love it, love it. Story so good and keeps you on your feet. Keeps you wanting more and more! wish there were more books like that.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Ok when I first got this game I was beast but after Rio came out I updated it. I played it for only 2 weeks. I had 48,983 coins and my points were very high( like I said BEAST)........starts to lag and for a while then I turn it off and on again the game starts me over like pionts 000 coins 0 and 3 boards.<br />This happened twice so I'm never playing again!!!!!!! unless they can change it up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished all three books in less than 2 weeks, and I work more than full time! I was so sad and happy at the end.  Defenitly a must read!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Just as I expected, another wonderful yet dark novel from Flynn. I can't wait until she writes more!  I would definitely recommend this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading this book when all three were out, and was I happy about that. I could not stop reading it and wanted to know more. Very good!
B0012250IM|5.0|This just brings the beautiful images of this movie to your mind and heart when it is played.  We added it to our Christmas playlist this year and are completely delighted whenever a song comes on.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute movie with awesome cartoon graphics.  Fun characters and antics that everyone in the family can relate to.  Cute story with good under-lying points for us all to consider.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|We got so much enjoyment out of this and each Diary of a Wimpy kid movie.  Our whole family, mom, dad, daughter, and grandmother all had a Wimpy Kid a-thon with the 1st 3 movies and it was a real treat for all!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|This wasn't as funny as I thought it might be but was a decent watch.  Recommended for a lazy weekend.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|Johnny Depp, is amazing and transformative in this role.  Love it!  Have seen it before...but just HAD to revisit the experience!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Once you have watched the first season, this second season is a must.  Different situation & characters but the same type of action, edge of your seat action.  Great Show!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|I watched this with my husband, not sure what we were going to get out of it.  I've heard good and bad about this movie.  It was a delight.  We loved the era of music, the actors really rocked, and all in all...just a fun, fulfilling experience to watch.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of comic to movie stories, but this was a decent watch.  Recommended for a lazy family weekend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read Slammed and Point of No Return, and love Colleen Hoover's story telling.  I loved the Characters, and the changes in point of view.  I saw that there may be a movie based on Slammed, and that would be awesome.  The poetry and the premise, so wonderful, powerful and sweet.  But HOPELESS, to me, blows it out of the water.  WOW, big secrets, big surprises, and 2 characters who are bound together by things that they don't even realize.  I'm dying for a chance to read this again.  This was the best ever first kiss without even kissing.  The build up between these characters and the depth they must delve within themselves to allow the other one in is amazing.  All the characters surrounding them have such depth too.  This book is a must read!  I don't even know if Colleen Hoover has more than these 3 books...  I would gladly ready anything she puts out.  She is THAT good!  HOPELESS is the BEST book I've read in YEARS!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This wasn't exactly what I was expecting it to be but was a decent watch.  Recommended for a lazy weekend family watch.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Even though it's not a big budget movie with expensive sets, the story is good, the actors are really good and it's very enjoyable to watch.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Once I had watched the first season, this was a must purchase.  The action (although a little different dynamic from season one) continues along with the character's complicated relationships that make good TV.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|I usually run from movies with a teenage cast but this movie is just plain wonderful.  The cast is great, the story is great and the characters adorable.  This is on my shelf with favorites.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be but got more and more into it as it progressed.  I hope there is a follow up.  Recommended.
B008XG1X18|4.0|If you're looking to lose hours of your day, this is the app for you! Makes Pinterest easy for the Kindle Fire.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|This wasn't as good as I had hoped it might be but was a decent watch.  Some actors were worth watching in this.  Recommended for a lazy weekend.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It ARRIVED QUICKLY AND IT WORKS. I LIKE THE STYLE OF PLUG IN AS IT IS VERY CONVENIENT.<br />AND IT IS WHITE SO EASY TO FIND AMONG THE &#34;OTHER&#34; PLUG INS.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Once you have watched the two seasons, this third season is a must.  The relationships & dynamics continues along with the character's complicated relationships based in a zombie land that is addicting to watch!
B000IZA9NK|5.0|Action, classic Sy-Fi, comic book style, great fun! Why has there never been a sequel? The Blu-ray version is brillant.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Good movie with a great cast with out of the normal situations.  Good fantasy type of movie with so-so characters becoming stronger as the movie progresses.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I thought the book was great until the end.  Something that happened at the end was too hard to believe.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Cute movie especially for those adults that still like their cartoons.  I did find it a little dark and maybe too scary for younger children under the age of 12.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This type of solitaire is more challenging than the traditional version.  I have only downloaded this app recently so am still learning the rules.  However, after using the spades exclusively it would be nice to challenge myself more with matching spades and diamonds, then spades, diamonds and clubs, etc.  It is a nice departure from the standard version and mixes it up nicely.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The action and plot twists keep me coming back every week.  My favorite series this year!  Team Harvey and Mike.
B005LZWA5W|5.0|I first saw The Apartment when it came out about 1960 in the theater -- that tells you how old I am.  The Apartment is a good Holiday Season film with both Christmas and New Years scenes.  The story is Romance, Adultery, Big Business Horseplay, and Soulful Renewal.  I started watching it every New Years since it became available on videotape, then laser disc and DVD, and now, finally, on blu-ray.  Except for the sound -- the original soundtrack was never very good -- the blu-ray with good special features is well worth buying, even if you have the DVD.  In the big insurance company accountants' bullpen, the overhead lights would produce a standing-wave effect on laser disc and DVD.  The blu-ray has cured this.<br /><br />The only thing missing for me is a special feature discussing the camerawork within the apartment.  The camerawork is typical of the finest Panavision (2.35:1) of the period.  The simple apartment itself had everything: two fireplaces, a pull-down bed, plus a separate bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.  Filming within the apartment had to be difficult, but Billy Wilder made it look natural.<br /><br />If you have never seen the young Shirley MacLaine you are in for a treat.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Loved this book, but not as good as the first one.  I think Anna strayed a little away from the person we see in book one.
B0076I622Y|5.0|I have always loved this film and watch it on DVD every Holiday Season -- it's set at Christmas -- but the blu-ray version is better.  The blu-ray and the old DVD have basically the same content, but the improvement in the blu-ray visual experience will be clear on a good TV.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Very entertaining book, love the main characters wit.  Did not feel like one of those formula based, predictable books. Look forward to reading more from this author.
0061900656|5.0|This book reinforces everything a grandparent wishes to share with a toddler (2 yr. old) grandson.  It's simply stated; that is, the book is not too wordy & the illustrations are colorful.  It emphasizes the big brother as an important part in welcoming the new baby into the family.  Our grandson knew what to expect before the baby arrived.  As a toddler he calls the newcomer, &#34;my baby&#34; or his given name, he helps with getting diapers & wipes to assistant Mommy/Daddy or Nana, and he approaches the baby with gentleness & identifies with that fact that the baby is his.  Super book for a first time big brother experience.

B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Even though a kindle ebook notes that it must first be downloaded to a computer for manual transfer with this cable to the Kindle, I find that most of those E-Books download directly to my Kindle Fire.

0316077054|3.0|Super angsty! I still enjoyed the story even though the lead characters were annoying me.<br /><br />Lena is so mopey and angsty and a teen in general that she really annoyed me. She was all on again off again with Ethan. It was like a yo-yo at times! It was rather confusing after the events of the previous book. I felt like those events were out of character.<br /><br />Poor constant Ethan loves her so much that his only thought is to help her! He too had some mopey moments I had to persevere through!<br /><br />The light in this book is the relationship between Link and Ridley!! Love them! I also liked the introduction of a new character Liv. She was a breath of fresh air in this downer of a tale!<br /><br />A really intriguing conclusion but kinda obvious. I mean Lena did the thing she has been told to do for the whole series! She was kinda dense about what she should do. And the authors were pretty mush hitting her over the head with a sledge hammer about it! Not at all subtle.<br /><br />Cover Art - Simple but effective. Love that font, it is so distinctive.

B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book is nothing like I have ever read before! An absolutely riveting book, that kept me glued from start to finish. I was taken through a spiral of emotions and was completely drawn it.<br /><br />An outstanding plot and fascinating characters.

B00ACHXHII|4.0|I had only heard Constantin Silvestri conducting the orchestral accompaniement on some concerto recordings before purchasing this set. The recording are mostly from the 1950's, but sound quality is generally good. I especially liked the Dvorak and Tchaikovsky recordings. These performances are with several orchestras. As you would expect, the best orchestral execution is with the Vienna Philharmonic, the worst with the Frence orchestras. At a shade over $2/disc, well worth adding to your collection.

1451695195|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but I would have liked Dr. Alexander to go into more of what he saw in Heaven.  It seems like he wrote the book to bring proof to the medical community.  Good book for skeptics that need a prestigious Doctor to convince them, not so good for folks who already know there is a heaven and want to hear more about it!  I would recommend this book to my unbelieving engineer son in-law!!

They read in Idaho, I read in Kansas City.<br /><br />Initial question:<br />What does Albom write that my 99 year old grandmother might connect with?<br /><br />End of book reaction:<br />My grandmother would enjoy the writing Albom did about tradition and of not being forgotten.<br /><br />The book has made me wonder about my family's traditions - the things that I could be able to trace to three or four generations before me. What are they?<br /><br />An excellent, warming read.

That in itself is a great reason to own this watch.

0061120073|5.0|Betty Smith's novel, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is an essential read for teen girls learning about their surroundings.  This historical fiction, set in early 1900s Brooklyn, leaves readers feeling like they have grown by reading the book. The plot centers around Francie, a girl who grows up with and learns to navigate a dark world.<br /><br />  The beginning of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn establishes the poverty Francie Nolan, the protagonist, faces. Evidence of the Nolans' poverty can be found when Smith writes about how Francie enjoys \\"their one great luxury,\\" wasting coffee: \\"From time to time, she'd smell the bitter sweetness of it. That was better than drinking it. At the end of the meal, it went down the sink... Mama explained: `...I think it's good that people like us can waste something once in a while and get the feeling of how it would be to have lots of money and not have to worry about scrounging'\\"(14). Since Francie's mother, Katie Nolan, likens being wealthy to not worrying about scrounging, you could infer that her family is poor. A middle-class person would think it was normal to live without scrounging. The poverty, and other problems such as Francie's frequently drunken father, creates a challenge for Francie's growth.<br /><br />  One of Betty Smith's messages is that in order to grow up, you must understand the world in which you are growing. The tree foreshadows this theme in the beginning. Smith writes about that type of tree, \\"You saw a small one of these trees through the iron gate leading to someone's yard and you knew that soon that section of Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there first\\"(6). This detail suggests the tree understands poor habitats and that is why it thrives in these places. In the contrast, Francie is initially too innocent to understand the darkness of her life. Her naïveté is demonstrated in the passage, \\"Francie made Mama watch while she put the eight cents in the tin-can bank. They had apleasant five minutes conjecturing about how much was in the bank. Francie thought there must be nearly a hundred dollars. Mama said eight dollars would be nearer right\\"(12). Francie is too naïve at this point to see that her family is poor.  She will have to understand the circumstances if she is to succeed as she gets older. The tree symbolizes this requirement and, in that way, sets the stage for Francie's story.<br /><br />  Teenage girls who are beginning to understand the realities of life and enjoy pondering these discoveries should read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. It is about a girl who is challenged to face the facts of her life. The plot would be attractive to another girl facing similar challenges because she could relate to Francie and would learn more about life. A Tree Grows in Brooklyn helps develop readers by vividly portraying Francie's development.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|OK movie, satisfactory acting, but not nearly as well done as the novels by James Lee Burke. Lwt's see more--and better-done movies of books written by Burke.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I oredered the first season to see if the shows justify the cost. The answer is a resounding yes... great actors and great writing. I will purchase every season available.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was excellent. I could not put it down. It grabbed my attention from the very first page. The characters were very believable. A must read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The author wove a story that is full of adventure and hard to put down.<br /><br />The reader is confronted with a story that reveals the possibility of a country where basic liberties are denied to the citizens and controlled by a small seemingly utopic, almost whimsical governing portion of the country, the &#34;Capitol&#34;, that live in a surreal bubble shielded from the harsh realities that are imposed to the oppressed mass citizens. A very thoughtful read of how precious human liberties are and should not be taken for granted (protected at all costs).<br /><br />Audience should be older teens to adults who can appreciate the deeper message of the story while also reading about the gruesome reality of 'The Hunger Games'. Graphic descriptions of all nature are kept to a PG-13 level.<br /><br />Subjects covered: basic survival needs, the trivialization of life, gift of self sacrifice for loved ones, conflict of young love and conflict of deep familial love. Needless to say, VERY thought provoking and amazing food for thought.<br /><br />Currently released movie runs very close to the book but as the case in most situations such as these, the book reveals more details and the deeper thought processes behind actions.<br /><br />Once again, a highly recommended read to older teens and adults; enjoyed it immensely.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This book started off slow but by the middle of the book I could not put it down. Lots of twists and turns.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|I bought this watch to have a big bulky watch for the weekends and boy is it big and bulky.  I agree with the other reviews that I do not like the strap, but I have not had any issues with mine.  It is just different that what I was expecting.  It is leather on the inside, but some type of material on the outside that looks like canvas.  If you wear long sleeves, you may have to push one sleeve up a little because your watch may not fit under the cuff.  I took off one star because of the strap.  Otherwise, I was happy with my purchase.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|The whole process from cancer to no cancer was interesting and amazing.  The last few chapters of this book were very profound and insightful for me........love yourself, get rid of fear, live your life.  We often forget these things when going through the  dance of life and connecting with people and getting through some stressful times.  Thank you Anita M.  for this book.  I truly loved what you had to say.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|G5 has always provided fun and interesting games, but this tops the rest. The story line is engaging, the puzzles are fun and the pace is pleasant. It is a very in depth game with plenty of dynamic. Every turn you have to keep your eyes open for clues. It really provides hours and hours of entertainment and was definitely worth the money.
B000GIXEIG|3.0|\\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" is a mediocre medieval action film loosely adopted from the classic Anglo Saxon poem \\"Beowulf.\\" The movie takes too long to introduce the lead character. Ingvar E. Sigurdsson plays Grendel as a savage man full of grunts and not easily understood. The special effects used for Grendel's mother are not very special. Sarah Polley plays Selma, a witch added to the poem who does not fit in with the setting or other characters, to give Beowulf a romantic interest but only comes off as a too modern voice whose North American accent really does not fit in with the rest of the cast who generally are from Europe. There are hosts of forgettable warriors accompanying Beowulf. The ending is oddly anticlimatic.<br /><br />By all rights this film should have been a disaster. Strangely it wasn't--and most of the credit for that goes to Gerard Butler in the lead role. Butler carries this movie and Stellan Skarsgård is a solid supporting actor as Hrothgar. While she does not appear much in the film (though her role is expanded in some of the deleted scenes), Steinunn Ólína Porsteinsdóttir does a credible job as Wealtheow. The film was shot in Iceland and it shows. The landscapes are spectacular. While certainly not a good film, \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\" escapes being a bad film due to strong performances, interesting action scenes and the visuals. It's certainly worth a view for fans of medieval fantasy and action films.<br /><br />The DVD offered some deleted scenes that did little to add to the movie besides fleshing out Hrothgar and Wealtheow. There is a trailer showing a few scenes from \\"Wrath of Gods,\\" a documentary on the making of \\"Beowulf and Grendel.\\" I usually don't find those types of documentaries interesting but I did find the scenes included in this DVD to be more intriguing than some of the actual film.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My son introduced me to this game.  So far, it has been fun and entertaining.  Easy to get money when you learn how to hatch the dragons and they are so cute.

0671042858|3.0|Stephen King's Story \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\"<br />A story of perseverance, survival and self-discovery<br /><br />  The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is a riveting suspense-horror story written by Stephen King. The author positions a girl against not only a creature of terror but also tests her inner resolve in a multitude of challenging conflicts with both herself, nature and family.<br />The story is different than most because Trisha is only 9 years old and sees the innocence and simplicity of the world. Trisha is confronted with a new ideal, that \\"the world had teeth and it could bite you with them anytime it wanted\\" (King, 1999) and her only rationale was \\"All because I needed to pee\\" (King, 1999) as understood through her thoughts.<br />  The Structure of the story is setup and broken down into innings like a baseball game and the baseball terminology plays a huge role in understanding the ending of the story.  As Trisha tells of her struggles in the story the settings progressively worsen and environments she is exposed to reveal more information about her thoughts, beliefs and the deterioration of her mind and body as she struggles for survival and entertains blind hopes for a rescue.<br />Throughout her ordeal, Trisha learns about her environment and her impact, or lack thereof, on her environment.  What starts off as simply a bathroom break leads to a more serious turn of events as she wanders farther and farther away from civilization in Maine's wilderness.  Her only tether to reality is her Walkman radio, upon which she listens nightly to the World Series and accounts of her hero, baseball player Tom Gordon.  Her belief of his icy veins in stressful situations leads her to find her own steely resolve to take each day and each step further into her adventure, which at times becomes perilous as well as exhilarating.<br />  King's use of description allows the reader to feel the elements, to breathe the rank air, to experience the terror felt by a nine-year-old girl lost in the wilderness.  The depth of experiences faced by this girl on her eight-day journey takes the reader with her and becomes the champion for her survival.  As she wanders through the countryside, she ruminates about her family, one which is going through divorce, how she misses her father, and of course, her hero, the infamous Tom Gordon, with whom she shared many lovely memories with her father.  This rumination and the memory of one man's resolve leads her to believe she will experience another day.  The hope experienced by a pre-teen girl leads her to the depths of her being to a resolve previously unknown even to her.<br />  As her journey becomes more and more perilous toward the end of her resolve and resources, the beast that had been at her side and terrorizing her seems to come closer and closer to her, if only in her mind.  Trisha stumbles across a meadow where she finds the remnants of a gate and a fence, and as elation washes over her, her excitement is soon replaced by the terror being stalked by the huge beast that had accompanied her through her journey.  At the end, she faces her demon down with the only tools with which she is armed, her Walkman, batteries long dead, yet still an element of her survival.<br />  \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" is a story of resilience, survival, and hope.  It is also a story of surviving with the very few tools you are given in this life, albeit told from the perspective of a very young and guileless young lady.  Her story is everyone's story - we fight our daily battles with the tools we are given and hope to see each day through.  Even though we may come out on the other side - broken, battered, and somewhat cynical - we do indeed come out and continue forward.year-old girl lost in the wilderness.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love cut the rope so I figured I'd give this a try.  Lots of fun and nice graphics :)
B008Y6WPXC|4.0|This movie is full of every action star you ever grew up with. Lots of fun seeing these guys doing what they do best.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I give all the Michael Connelly books about Harry Bosch a 5 rating because they are all excellently written. The characters are so real. I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys a good detective novel.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|This is the first Taylor Swift album I have ever purchased and I can definitely say it was worth the money.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this version is boring and I like the firist one better I just don't like it it makes my head hurt :(
B008EEB4TA|5.0|Just wanted to make sure I left a 5 star review for this album, I bought it last year and today as I'm adding songs to my playlist, I can't help but want to add most of these songs. Thanks for existing, Marina.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I didn't like this because I had to wait for a date or time to play it.  I wanted to play it immediately and anytime I wanted to.  This disappointed me very much.  I am deleteing it now.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is more fun than temple run 1. new features and amazing graphics. my only complaint is that the graphics are real enough to give me motion sickness, but thats a personal complaint. so much fun!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's about time that Mrs. Obrien gets her upcomings!!!  Robert needs to step down and let Matthew & Tom run Downton Abbey.
B00AVNQ3YS|5.0|I realy don't agree with the negative reviews of a few suppose to be Manowar fans. I think, and I said this after listening to both versions (The Hammer version and the final version)that this is a very solid effort and truly Manowar album. It has all the calssic manowar style of the mid 80's Power and true heavy metal without wimpy moments. Don't listen to the negative reviews. this is a great manowar album. they are back for real. If this is too loud for some of you, go a listen to Lady Gaga. Leave true heavy metal alone!
1419705849|5.0|My son loved the latest installment in this series. Well worth the price, especially with free shipping. What a deal! My son's happiness is priceless, but it came cheap. All the better. He loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down and the plot and various character development was unexpected and appreciated.  Nice to see fresh writing is still prevalent.  I already bought the 3rd book after getting Catching Fire because of how quickly I was digesting the story.
0345803493|3.0|This was a little bit of a let-down. Not my kind of subject matter, and not as interesting as the first. Maybe the novelty had worn off. Sloppy in contrast with the first book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fantastic read.  Well done Ms. Collins and now I want my own military suit made by Cinna.  Can't wait to see how they develop this story in the movies but the underlying current that war, regardless of the circumstances that brought it on, take their toll in unique psychological and personnal ways we never expect nor can predict.
0345803507|4.0|Anti-climactic. Not my kind of subject matter, and not as interesting as the first. The novelty had worn off. I will definitely not read another installment, should it be written.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Is an awesome app u have to run away from a huge monster/bear<br />So I have been playing it for a long time<br />SO GET THIS APP NOW AND THEN THE NEXT FEW DAYS U WOULD BE HOOKED TO IT
B007SY3CEW|3.0|Users of touch devices that only recognize one or two inputs at a time should stray away from this (and similar apps I assume) because certain songs do require 3 or more notes to be depressed at the same time and these devices will not recognize your input properly.  This is not a game flaw per se but it should be pointed out in the app description.  The real issue is price and customizability.  the song list is limited and there does not appear to be an option for downloading new ones.  the odd pricing, $2.90 as of this review, is a bit steep too, at best this is a $1.99 app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty cool. Wish it didn't take so long to do things or cost so much.<br />This game I could play all day but can't because I have to sit there and wait on things
B0015S0P7Y|1.0|They shipped me a movie for region 2, which does not work in my dvd player.otherwise cloverfield is an excellent movie
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great read just like the rest of the series. I recommend this book and the series. Don't know what else to say.
B008UUPOVM|5.0|Everything on this album is awesome. Owl City's style is unique and trendy. My niece introduced me to them and I am so glad. They have a great sound. Lots of songs on this album and all of them are good. I'm a fan!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An addicting and fun game!  I enjoy the horsey sounds and &quot;treating&quot;!  Horses are the best and this is a great virtual horse!
B0091REZMW|1.0|As everyone else said, pay to play. It's sad how a huge majority of fun games are turning to this buying tokens just to have entertainment.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I knew it was about a pilot that drank before landing a crashing plane. I didn't realize it would be about an alcoholic/alcoholism. still a very good movie. great acting. ending was a little obvious.
B002NJUN44|5.0|I bought this for a co-worker as a Christmas gift and she loved it. I was really surprised when she asked for this but...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is a must have for your collection. These are classic movies to enjoy with your family. My kids are hooked on them and watch them over and over. Their favorite one is Return of the Jedi.
B000MDHJFE|4.0|at the end of the movie i was thinking was the wife telling  the truth. and the husband did not paid him  jimmy stewart  was a good lawyer.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|Kept waiting for it to get better and it never really did. Very disappointed in this movie not good not bad
B005LAII12|3.0|Not my usual type of movie and found it quite rude, x rated, but funny all at the same time.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very good science fiction.  Story has several twist that surprise the reader.  Author keeps interest throughout story, the details are good and storyline is set at a good pace.  I like that the good characters have some bad traits and the the bad some good.  Will read more of his work.
B003TH14H4|5.0|It's a great series and I intend to get the rest of the seasons over time. Full of humor and suspense.
B000FBJAOG|1.0|Awful!  Total waste of time and money, would have sent back for credit if possible. Did not finish, most likely  never will.<br /><br />The zombie survival guide
1250027624|5.0|If you are a Downton fan you will really enjoy this book  Also it is a great gift for someone that loves Downton
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is pretty addicting and great for getting your mind going.  It comes with a decent amount of games to figure out and if you want more when you finish them all they are available.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I Love it now I always have 2 alarm clocks in case I forget or don't have my other one.
B000W1W8W0|5.0|He remebered hearing it as a kid.  One of his best friends turned him on to the sound.<br />We recently had watch a Blues Project documentary.  They were before their time.  Good stuff.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is  best game ever I love it only one thing for the super mystery box you have to play every day if you get it then you'll know what I mean
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Embodies the principles of quantum physics accurately. This shows ideas and concepts that are possible in the real world just do a little research (Solvey Physics conference 1927). Fact is stranger than unknown fact.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this app. Addicted to passing it all the time but it puts my mind at ease and erases the stress of the day.. definitely should get it if you don't have it already...
0399242864|5.0|I bought this for my 3yr. old grandson, I wanted him to become aware of the stars as he looked up in the sky and also how he could pretend if he caught a star, it would be his friend
B00B2V66VS|5.0|a nice continuation of temple run. played the first one for hours, now working on this one. still having problems with the mine part. practise should help.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Great action movie. This movie keeps your interest all the way through. It has a good story line. Highly recommend
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good mix of the human side with the facts. 11 more words required, no 9 more words requird, this is absurd.
B00007AJGH|5.0|One of my favorites. I recommend it to anyone with kids. Mine is autistic and he loves it. One of his favorites.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great solitaire game! I know there are other solitaire games out there..but this one is so<br />easy and the graphics are super clear! I have gotten some that are very blurry.I would really give this game a 10 out of 10..I can't seem to stay away from it!.And I have a lot of other things that need to be done at home..at least that is what my family tells me!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is great quality, keeps you entertained, you shed pounds in a very healthy way, and it was delivered very well. Overall the video is great and have to love Jillian Michaels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it....amazing read, intense, pulls you in and won't let go.  I highly recommend this and the first book. :)
B004NBZG06|5.0|Amusing as all Georgette Heyer's books and also with the usual surprises.  I don't know how I'd missed this one for years, but am glad I found it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|After playing the free portion of the game, I was compelled to buy the rest if the content for $2.99. It was well worth it. The variety of puzzles makes for a very entertaining game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Making junk hmmmm hmmmm junk by hugging hugging kings hungry jjhhh bunch Johnny hi hmmmm Mbeki John junk ok unfunny Kaminski junk big hmmmm hugging bunch ok b j
B00AREIAI8|4.0|from what i have done so far it is fun.  its kinda weird but it is fun so i would try it
B009PK9SB8|5.0|everyone needs this that bought the gopro.  It eliminates so many errors<br />for the first time user.  great quality product.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so much fun i loved it. its kinda weird at first because i was used to the first one but now i just love this one.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|just what I needed to watch on a bad day!  Great and fun.<br />wonderful music and the dancing was amazing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|well it works good for a calculator and it gets me though my 7th grade math homework and its not that hard to use I like it because its easy to read and good for percent times and divide
0307346617|5.0|I purchased this a couple years ago and I've read it twice and lent it out 3 times - it's a book well traveled!  Incidentally, my father and friends shared my glowing review.<br /><br />Like \\"The Lord of the Flies\\", Z provides - on a superficial level - a great story of a global zombie pandemic; however, this narrative also constitutes an effective vehicle to address myriad issues like government authority, personal freedom, and national responses to broadscale crisis.  Very timely.<br /><br />The documentary format is highly effective and Brooks is an outstanding writer with an eye for the technical details (idiom, structure) critical to a fluid read.<br /><br />EDIT:  OK, wait - obviously LOTF is NOT about a worldwide zombie outbreak - though Jack's minions are behaving that way by the end!  What I was trying to say is that, like LOTF, WWZ provides a cosmetically entertaining action/adventure story which lends itself to interpretive analysis on myriad levels - such as social, political, psychological, humanitarian, and religious.<br /><br />Life is short - listen to the Grateful Dead.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I tried, I really tried but this was just too simplistic. I'm not sure why this was so highly rated, I read several reviews before purchasing and chose to ignore the negatives since the overall rating was high, my mistake. Fortunately it was a quick read so I was able to move onto other things.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to move along to another book and spare yourself.
0545265355|5.0|I am NOT Collins' target demographic (or at least her publisher's target audience) - yet, this story grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  It's been a long time since I've read until 2 a.m. on consecutive nights during a work week!
B0012DK4ZU|5.0|A 1979 release, Phantasm moved swiftly enough for its contemporary audiences and pushed the current envelope for what could be shown of sex and gore. It is valuable for what it shows of late-70's styles and expressions, although the scripted lines can sound a little hesitant and stilted to our ears today. This was THE horror film for me and college friends to see during my senior year in college. Loved to re-watch this recently thanks to Amazon and the internet. Want to get an idea of the dark stuff that scared us in the late 70's? This is what you need to see.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I grew up watching Transformers as a kid every Saturday morning (back when Bumble Bee was a VW Bug.) Regardless, I love that he is now a Camaro and is sporty. Optimus does it again in this movie... lots of combat scenes----you can't go wrong with those.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is such a great book.. I couldn't stop reading it.. It took me 5 days to read it... Dont miss it..
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Considering I have every season and pre-order them.... I think that speaks for itself. Who doesn't love Charlie Hunnam? The show is a little hard core, so not everyone will like it, but I've convinced a number of friends and co-workers to watch it, and they thank me each season becuase they have another &#34;addiction&#34; that they have to feed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book, it kept me in full suspense. I absolutely could not put it down! I would recommend reading it.
B007NU54H4|5.0|This was a gift for my niece.  I had actually ordered it a little late because I had to also mail it out.  It came very quick and I was able to get the gift to her a head of time.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Read this, it's great!  The important thing to know about it is that the first half is taken up with stories that end abruptly and are completed in the second half, and the timeline is from the 1840's to far in the future, and back again.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I am very happy with this movie.  It exceeded my expectations and it has become my Saturday Afternoon go to movie.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a very good book that deserved to be made into a movie.  The ending is a surprise.  Were the stories about the animals true?  You decide.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I didn't know Josh directed this film until after I saw it. I loved Serenity and I'm a big Marvel fan. What a great combination.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|If you are going to Australia like we did, throw away the Frommers or Fodors and read this instead.  Highly informative and entertaining.  It will help you understand the country and its people.  Glad I read it before we went.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Today when I openned DTG, I had to sign in to Amazon App Store to use DTG. Just great! I am in China and when the Great Fire Wall won't let memesign to Amazon, I won't bebeable to use DTG. Did I waste my $15?????
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book.  Was a nice, relaxing romance and i can recommend it to anybody who enjoys romances.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This app is addictive! I love the slight pressure of the timer, and the overall challenge this game sets for you.<br /><br />I'm really happy Amazon made this FAOTD or I may never have tried it!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|I ordered it to be delivered in USA, but its final destination was South America. I got the package in perfect shape and it worked awesome on my blue ray. Can't wait for the next seasons to come!
5699214127|5.0|The book is in excellent conditions and they sent it very fast. It was a gift and my friend loved it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|game is a good time killer and I have not spent any of my own money. I would recommend this to anyone
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased Perplexus for my 9 year old niece as a Christmas gift! Turns out the whole family enjoyed trying to solve the maze. I purchased Epic for my boyfriend's birthday and he loves it! This version is more complicated and &#34;perplexing&#34; than the original. Lots of fun! I recommend for all ages. It is a fun game!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|you can play this game at your own pace graphics are great. great for any age. I would regimens this to all who want to take a brake during the day
B004P7CN7W|5.0|I've always loved this movie, and now I finally have a copy that isn't a worn out VHS tape. Pick it up if you want to relive the silliness and scary 90's thrill ride!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This is probably one of the best animated features from DC. Picture quality was really good. It looked great on my Sony Bravia. Voice casting was very well picked. Even though at times I can't see Kevin Conroy not doing the voice of Batman, Bruce Greenwood does a great job. The story was very emotionally driven which I think is a bit of change up from what I'm used to seeing in various animations. The disc also has a BTS look at the film which is really cool. Really happy with this buy.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Wonderful movie, awesome actors, great director. If you say you hate it then GET OUT, anyway....yeah...need 4 more words. There!
B001TCHDPS|5.0|That really comes from reality !<br />It is 30 years old but... so it is so present-day, actual as well !
B005V1WZ10|5.0|One of my favorite KoRn albums to date, I love each album in a different way, this one for its hard beats and Dupstep influences. KoRn has once again changed the game in music, I love how they always push the envelope. I found this CD well worth the money I paid for it with, and the DVD of the Korn Field jam session is a good rainy day DVD to watch. It include a lot of songs form KoRn III, Remember Who You Are and some great jams on their own, Totally get it if you are a die hard KoRn fan.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Cold fact... hard fact but actual fact !<br />It is 30 years old but... but it is so present-day as well !
B0085A9HXS|4.0|Story is ok.  acting is ok.  But lots of action.  A bit predictable at times, but overall a good movie
B0049J3QF4|1.0|The storyline to this movie goes as followed.<br /><br />People in the big city are selfish, gready and self-cented. It also shows how people in the big city are depressed, can't be trusted and are back stabbers.<br /><br />The only way to be happy in life, according to this show, is as followed. Move out to a small town and hold onto the past. Because farmers are the only ones who can be trusted, honest and helpful.<br /><br />Another bias Disney show.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie.  Plot was good, acting great, awesome action scenes.  Watched it several times (and in the theater) Recommend this to anyone.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|It sucks that the kindles come with a camera but you have to download an app. plus this app really doesn't work well. The pictures come out blurry. Guess I will have to purchase a better one.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|A got to have for any music fan.  While My Guitar Gently Weeps alone makes the album. Love Harrison RIP
B007MU85D0|5.0|this band is just incredible. the vocals and instrumentals complement each other so well. definitely worth the purchase plus pretty cheap. win win
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|My very favorite of these classic novels. Extremely well written and plot driven. Love the characters and the love story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Always reading & knowing someone will die but this book totally changed & surprised me!!! Loved it!!! I can not wait to see this Friday!!!!
B00APJLFEG|3.0|Good message, nice approach. I love cartoons, but this one was aimed a bit below my adult level of humor. Still a nice romp!
1419705849|5.0|My son has been loving and collecting the Diary of Whimpy Kid series.  We even love and bought the movies.  When I saw this book had been released, I ordered it as a surprise to him.  It was at our house so quickly, it was amazing.  Thank you very much.
B00007ELEL|5.0|Most people are familiar with this classic film, but if you are one of the few who haven't seen it, get it. Merchandise was as advertised and arrived promptly.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie but by the end I just thought it was okay.  The acting was pretty flat.  The plot was just not imaginative or very interesting.  The fx were great but not enough to carry the movie.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|I am a Jane Austen and PD James fan and this sequel did not disappoint. PD James captured Austen's world very well and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00846F1YW|5.0|so far it plays well hasn't froze but haven't made level 13 yet I like these hidden object with other puzzles thrown in they are entertaining.
0670026603|5.0|What a great book!  I am almost finished with the book, and it is the best i have read since \\"The Help\\".<br />I had to stop reading last night because I couldn't stop crying.  I'm going to finish it now (with a box of<br />Kleenex).
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Feel-good sports movie that tries to go deep but ends up being fairly predictable. Amy Adams is adorable like always, and Justin Timberlake brings a fun vibe to the film.
1400067820|4.0|This is Taleb's third popular book on randomness, following [[ASIN:B00404YOU4 Fooled By Randomness]] and [[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan]].  Taleb is more iconoclastic, and the topics broader, in each successive title.  Although he considers Antifragile his best work, I would recommend reading them in order since they build upon one another.<br /><br />One of the things Taleb warns against in Antifragile is the diminishing value of an expert's opinion as they get further from their area of expertise.  Taleb's exposition and overall strength of his ideas are most powerful when he talks about what he knows: finance and economics.  Outside of economics and finance, he expresses his discontents with academics in general, and medicine in particular.  His criticism are thought provoking, but I perceive the value of his remedies to be on par with many he criticizes in his books -- particular since these are areas without the kinds of Black Swans you see in economics and finance, a critical feature of his fragile-antifragile duality.<br /><br />To use Taleb's terminology, many of the problems in medicine and biology are closer to \\"linear\\" than he realizes (even when they are technically nonlinear in a somewhat different mathematical sense).  The idea that everything in condensed matter physics of any importance was understood by the time Einstein came around is false.  Like contemporary condensed matter physics, the limitations in physiology are not always that the reasons for things are unknowable, but that sometimes we just haven't figured them out yet.  Often the problem with modern medicine is not too much theory and too little tinkering, but instead having a doctor tinker with you since they don't know the reasons for things -- reasons that are potentially knowable.  Pushing back against your physician can be a good thing, but please do some additional research before you adopt Taleb's diet and exercise recommendations and stop taking all your medications.<br /><br />Antifragile is long and meandering.  In The Black Swan this writing style was necessary to get across the nuance in Taleb's ideas.  So too in Antifragile, but he is also capitalizing on his current standing to sound off on every opinion he has ever had.  And his snarkiness is increasing (although I can't help but enjoy his comments on Thomas \\"The Mustache of Understanding\\" Friedman).<br /><br />So why the four stars?  Because everything Taleb has to say is thought provoking, even when supported by cherry-picked research.  More importantly, his insights and deep understanding of what plague our financial and economic systems functionally and ethically are TREMENDOUSLY important and, in my opinion, spot on. He mocks expertise and theory (and the pompousness of professors who in fact have less grandiose titles than his own), but he and his theories are the real deal in his field.  He understands what happens when simple models -- ones that give at best a qualitative understanding of a system in certain limited settings -- are used to make operational decisions.  He explains, and has given us the language to understand, fragility and antifragility, a concept when used thoughtfully should be a valuable tool in making decisions.
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|Helen Mirren shines as a female reincarnation of  Prospero, one of Shakespeare's most compelling heroes. Her supporting cast is strong, and the unusual soundtrack and lush settings bring this magical tale to life in a weird, mystical way that I think Shakespeare would have greatly appreciated. I especially liked the use of Shakespeare's original songs throughout the movie and how the end credit song was the play's word-for-word epilogue. My only real complaint was the complete nudity on Ariel's part - even in his androgynous form, it was a little too gratuitous.
B00005B1W7|4.0|Good series. True to the book. Seems fairly long but very engrossing. Top notch performances adds to the overall flow
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was great! I read it from start to finish in about 4 hours.  I loved Charlie as a character, and several times imagined myself smoking a cigarette with these kids. Damn Aunt Helen.
B009LDXQGW|3.0|This is a talented group, but a single edited cd of their best ten songs would've been more than enough for this effort. The compilation of three cd's with ten songs each was just too much to say that most of their songs sound pretty similiar to one another and follow almost identical veins. Nice if you want to lay around all day smoking herb, letting life pass you by.  Otherwise, the best advice I can give this group is EDIT, EDIT, and then EDIT AGAIN.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I ENJOYED RAEDING THIS BOOK BUT FOUND THE STORY LINE A LITTLE SLOW TO DEVELOP.<br />I would recommand to my friends
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I've had these for almost 2 months now and I love the sound they deliver. They have a nice look to them and are very comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. I had previously used Sennheiser HD 201 headphones, and although a decent pair for their price, their low sensitivity meant I had to turn the volume louder than normal. But with these, the sound is clear with a nice mid-range. At the $50 and under pricepoint, you won't find any better headphones than this Superlux.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have read other books in this genre and this one is just crap.  I don't know why it got so much attention from the conservatives, because it is one of the worst written novels in this genre I have ever read.  Not only was the story boring and main character extremely dull, but the writing is just sub-par.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. It shows the growth and maturity of Katie (the main character). It did take a little bit to get into - but once you are 1/3 of the way into the book, you won't be able to put it down. Definitely a thriller.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Awesome movie. I love that fact it has all of the 1980s and 1990s classic action movie stars in it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had such a spin on it - I could not believe it! I did not see the book going where it did. Showed the great budding of a teenage romance.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|VERY addictive and challenging.  Have a hard time putting it down.  Fun for the whole family.  Would definitely recommend. Love it.
B00846F1YW|2.0|of course this does the same as part 1!!!! you get to a point where the hidden object is UNDER the menu bar. this makes the game impossible to play!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this app it is so much fun! you can feed the animals &amp; play ball with them and wash them it is so much fun!  so that is why. you shod get this app.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I felt like I was watching an award winning Ken Burn's documentary on PBS, except it was much, much cooler. I'm looking forward to the soundtrack just as much as the upcoming tour. It really pulls the curtain back on how great music is made. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is a true fan of music.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Loved this game. G5 always has great games with good storylines. Keep up the good work. Do not make the games too easy though.

B0007TKNII|5.0|Beautiful performances by all of the lead characters.  Romance sweeps you away with this intentional melodramatic musical.  Beautiful, handsome, sexy... the leads have it all and will take you with them into their fantasy world.

B002RKRUEA|5.0|This collection of essays form the Roman emperor were never meant to be published, but I'm glad they were. Contains some poignant thoughts about ethics and mortality that apply to any age. Definitely worth a look.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This was an excellent DVD... watching Michael Jackson in action on his most successful tour ever, the Bad tour.  He truly comes alive on stage, but more so with this performance because he knew Princess Diana, who he greatly admired, was there watching.<br /><br />I LOVED the close ups, which you don't see often on YouTube videos of his other tours and concerts.  He was magical, full of energy and incredible talent... and there is NO ONE today who can match him.  This was his desire, to be the best, and so he was and always will be.<br /><br />I only wish that more in the media would acknowledge that fact.  They seem to ignore all the accolades from Michael's artist/musician colleagues and friends that are heaped upon him.  He was more than just an artist, seen more as a prophet for influencing our generation and the next.  Michael has left an incredible legacy, that young children are only now learning about, and so his light will shine on.  Long live the King.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I've been a fan of Daft Punk since the Discovery album (and Interstella 5555!). The movie Tron Legacy was an uneven product with lots of highs and lows, but the music was definitely a high. Besides having lots of memorable beats, the music reminded me of classic science fiction movies like Blade Runner. Which is always a good thing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|First discovered on Netflix, I can't get enough of Downton Abbey!  Purchasing this on Amazon, I now own it instead of just renting from my cable company on demand!  Gotta love it!
1932907009|5.0|Anyone who is into writing - especially screenplays - needs to read this book! I held off on reading it for a couple of years, because of the title - thought it was too corney, but the wealth of information in his series is indisputable. This book gives you the framework for scriptwriting (and novels) and makes you see the truth about &#34;The Hollywood Formula&#34; I've been studying this for years - it's not a formula, it's just the way a good story has to flow - read it, learn it, understand it, and use it. You'll laugh along the way, and you will understand how to make your work better. The rest is up to you...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome! My only problem is that I had made so much progress and earned tons of points and the game just started me over at zero! I was bummed but I still love the game.

B000MZHW40|5.0|I was in refugee camp in Ghana when the horrible killings of innocent civilians of Sierra Leone happened because Belgium and others great powers such as the USA decide to sacrifice the democracy and the poor people of that country for the Blood Diamond.<br />It is unfortunate that members of the mentioned governments would not have the courage to watch this movie to the end. In any ways I dedicate this movie to the History with the prayer that such a horror never happens again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put it down, especially towards the ending.  I can't wait to the see the movie that is coming out.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Chris Eccleston brings likeable humor to the doctor, but the issue is not with him. The issue is with, #1: The enemies. The walking mannequins are even less convincing than in the classic series (NOT due to the CGI, which always has and always will be bad -- so get used to it -- but simply because of design decisions and the characters' interactions with them), and a certain rubberized trash container gives that episode an unwelcome cartoonish flavor. Later, there are farting aliens. #2: Supporting actors. The doctor and his assistant Rose are more than adequate in their roles, but Rose's family, particularly her boyfriend, are such terrible actors (particularly when interacting with CGI. Once again, I must bring up a certain cartoon trash can) that the overall quality of the entire series is lowered. In summation, the ideas are good, but apparently the staff were on different pages as to what the tone of the series should be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love it! what more can i say...thats it! nothing else!! its a great app that does great things. ha ha
B008JFUTT0|5.0|One word - WOW!!!  A guaranteed inspiration to anyone who watches it.  Rodriguez will remain an inspiration to me for the rest of my life, plain and simple.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|This almost wordless account of a little boy's midnight encounter with his lovingly made snowman is classic.  The enchantment comes partly from the artistry of color-crayon subtlety and partly from recognizing a dream's improbable sequences.  Children and grownups are drawn into this beautiful, short remembrance of winter magic.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Mysteryville is a cute hidden object game.<br />Likes:  good graphics, cute storyline, ability to turn all sound off and hint button<br /><br />dislikes:  sensitive play.  You're able to zoom in and out, but when you do the game makes the most annoying sound, like glass busting.  Every move around the screen that is made, the game thinks you're picking an object (more glass breaking).  luckily you can shut off the sound and the annoying music.<br /><br />It was the faotd, I would not pay 2.99.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really cool I LOVE IT please let me play . then I want to use the game very
B0063IH60K|4.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do! It is user friendly, and I would recommend this game to others.

B009RWRIZ2|5.0|Filming dance sequences for the cinema has always created controversy. From the shredding cuts of a film like \\"Chicago,\\" perhaps hiding the lack of talent of the performers, to the stately long \\"held\\" shots of Bolshoi ballets which deem them uncinematic to what some consider the perfect framing/editing of Astaire/Rogers films, Wim Wenders brings 3D technology to the performers of Pina Bausch's remarkable oeuvre. While the film can be viewed and enjoyed in 2D, it's just short of revolutionary to see these dance clips in 3D.<br /><br />The sometimes wicked, often austere and harsh choreography of Pina Bausch, is illuminated by her stable of regular performers, and, yes, this may not be to everyone's taste. But to see some of the greatest contemporary dance sequences in 3D format is unprecedented. Wenders skips the facts of Bausch's life in this \\"bio\\" film, and instead celebrates her through her company of extraordinary dancers performing. I understand that Bausch early on consulted on the film, but her death attenuated the collaboration. There is a brief sequence of testimony from the dancers themselves of Bausch's import, but otherwise, it's the joy of dance that is framed here.<br /><br />[Amending this review] The 3D disc did not play in my NTSC Samsung 3D player. This is a first for all the 3D films I've purchased. Reading online, I see that others had difficulty playing the 3D disc, and the buyer isn't alerted to this problem. I didn't return the item since the Blu-ray transfer that comes along with the 3D is exceptional. I do hope that in the future a 3D version that works is available.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Imposing and impressive plot.  Deeply rewarding characters.  Don't be fooled by the first few chapters. This begins as a whiney wife at home with kids story that blossoms with steadily increasing speed to a series of secrets revealed. Before long,it had me pondering Kate's dilemma. Very much worth the read.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I just never give negative reviews and usually just stay silent but this IS bad. I got this but it would not let me print what I needed to print without the Pro version so I went ahead and bought it. I still got the message that I couldn't print those same pages and to buy the Pro version. I am now  getting the message that I am out of free prints and to buy the Pro version. What do you think I paid for?? NOW they say it is NOTcompatible with Kindle Fire. What about those of us that paid for it before you admitted it doesn't work with Kindle Fire?? Where is our refund?? What about a little honesty? Folks please save yourself a headache and just keep looking for a different app. Please for your own good. No one deserves this
0385336950|5.0|I accidentally bought this book instead of \\"Cloud Atlas\\" by David Mitchell and I would have to say I'm not even disappointed in this mistake. It is a compelling novel and to be honest, and I have no idea why, but the first page almost made me cry...
B005CA4SJW|5.0|All i need to saw Is WOW love it the black and white episode was the best, wish they would do this for season 2 and 3
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Great Music.  Would prefer not to write so much just rate the product.  Recommend for the price.  Love this music
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I loved this story and didn't realised the twist to the very last second chapter. I felt I couldn't put this book away, Work interupted my reading.
B004G6009U|5.0|got it for my wife, she's just a kid at hart,loved the movie,would tell anyone with kids or that is a kid at hart to get it !!!!!!!!!!!!
086571701X|5.0|The answer is yes.  I was 100% confident to build my own system from the pictures and information contained in this book.  I am even able to explain aquaponics to my friends and family.  My system is high quality, self-contained and produces food for our family. I went way over board on my system but aquaponics is something you fall in love with.  Just imagine, the scent of fresh water and plants growing in your home.  My wife, son and I get caught staring at the fish and plants.  And yes it will be a learning experience when making your own system.  I learned a great deal.  But once you learn it you can always make things better or reinforce what you already know.  Luckily I am extremely confident at building projects and I had that edge, so I was able to make my system small yet at a professional level.  Whatever level you start at or end at this book will get you there.  I have had this book for about 8 month and I felt compelled to write this review.<br /><br />I would like to thank the author Sylvia Bernstein! I had a blast with your book and now I am the \\"aquaponic\\" guy at work lol.<br /><br />Rick

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great to be able to locate what I was looking for and immediately after the purchase was able to watch on any device on which I installed the amazon instant video app. Great quality, no issues.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Definitely my guilty pleasure! I was a little hesitant to watch it at first (it's an ABC show, so I assumed it would be sketchy at best), but it surprised me. Yes, there are plenty of moments when your just like 'wtf are these idiots doing', but it always redeems itself by the end of the episode. Plus, I'm in love with the character interaction. Good character chemistry can make a mediocre show fantastic, and that's basically what it did to PLL. Oh... and did I mention Jason and Toby? Honestly, PLL could be crap and I'd still be an avid viewer... I'd just watch it on mute. ;)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game to play while &#34;waiting&#34;  anywhere.  Not to mention challenging with its different levels. bold colors, easy to play on screen!
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I love Nicholas Sparks, but unfortunately this book was a let down. I was looking for a more unique storyline. This story was too predictable for me.
0765325950|5.0|This book is the best in the series. It is a total pageturner. The Last Battle scene is incredibly well written, there have been moments I laughed out loud and moments I cried.
B00846F1YW|4.0|really enjoyed it. but to play on small screen and needing to move pic around I end up making more mistakes
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love this book. It teaches you that time is just that a word and nothing else. We human beings make our lives complicated and because of that we forget to live.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was Awesome.  I Wish there were like this one.  Doese anyone know of any more books like this one?
B005IZLPMY|5.0|A critical and huge commercial success, this is among my favorites of the comic-book hero movies. Steve Rogers, a 98 lb weakling, who is transformed into the Captain America character, is among the more human of the Marvel Comic Book characters...he has super-human strengths in all areas...but he can be injured...just like us. I like that aspect of the story. I have not read how they transition Chris Evans, from the short, asthmatic Steve Rogers to the muscle bound Captain America, after being injected w/the &#34;super-soldier serum&#34;; but I'm sure it must have been done w/CGI. The CGI special effects - aside from the transition of Steve Rogers - is stunning...seen it before in other movies, but I never cease to be amazed with the special effects of today's movies. Something else I really liked about this story is that it's set during WW II in the 40s and Captain America is a captain in the American Army fighting the Nazi bad guys in Germany...much more patriotic than most Hollywood films, reminescent of the patriotism on display in movies filmed during the War. In addition to Chris Evans, look for Hugo Weaving, who delivers an outstanding performance as the evil Nazi genius, Johann Schmidt, or &#34;Red Skull&#34;. He has also received the &#34;super soldier serum&#34; but it affects him in different ways...which you'll see as the film develops. Stanley Tucci plays Dr Abraham Erskine, a German expatriot scientist, who developed the &#34;soldier serum&#34;. Captain America's love interest and British soldier is Peggy Carter, played superbly by Hayley Atwell. Tommy Lee Jones is Col Chester Phillips, Captain America's field commander. Also look for Toby Jones as the vice-villain, Dr Zola; and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, an inventor who is responsible for Captain America's uniform and equipment. Bottom line, this is an excellent cartoon actioner and highly recommended.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Saw them live bought there music ITS AMAZING!The lyrics all have meaning the beats are all catchy i know every song word for word!
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film released in 2011...my opinion of course.  The message of this film and its historic significance tip the scales in its favor. It is the first film I've been to in a very long time where the theater audience stood and applauded at the end. Some may say this is just a &#34;guilty white folks film&#34;, but having grown up in the South and having come of age (I graduated from high school in 1963) during the era in which this film is set, I can relate to much of the story. It is authentic in its telling of the relationship between white families, especially wealthy white families, and their &#34;Help&#34;. I say that from a white perspective; but I suspect the same is true for blacks who matured during that era. This story though is not heavy handed; it is balanced with just the right amount of pathos and humor; you will be laughing out loud one minute and reaching for a tissue the next. Hard to believe this is the first directorial effort for Tate Taylor, as he has crafted a masterful work here. The casting too is perfect. Viola Davis, who we don't see much on the big screen, shows why she is such a highly regarded stage actress with her portrayal of the maid, Aibileen Clark. Octavia Spencer delivers a superlative performance too, as Minny Jackson. Emma Stone, in what I believe is her best performance, plays the lead, Skeeter Phelan, an aspiring young writer, who coaxes the stories from the &#34;help&#34; for her book, appropriately titled &#34;The Help&#34;. Also look for Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter) Allison Janney, Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek in fine performances. This film will help us remember when we talk about &#34;the good old days&#34; that some things were definitely not so good.
030758836X|1.0|Although there are some interesting twists in this story, I did not enjoy reading this book. It is full of filthy language, the F-word is on just about every page, multiple times.  Very few, if any of the characters in the story are very likeable, some are even despicable, including the main characters.  None of us in our book club understood why this book is so popular.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|If this is indeed the last of the Harry Potter films and there will be no more sequels and no prequels, the franchise could not have gone out on a better note. This is a magnificent piece of cinema - Academy Award caliber - and I will be surprised if it does not garner multiple awards recognition. No other film this year (2011) has been so universally acclaimed by the professional critics. If this is truly the end, it is a bittersweet moment. Watching Harry and his two closest friends and the actors who play them grow and mature has been almost like watching my children come of age. In this final episode,Harry, Hermione, and Ron continue their search for the Horcruxes upon which Voldemort depends for life. All of us knew from the author, J. K. Rowling, that one of the protagonists would die in this final episode...but if you haven't read the book and you haven't seen this film, I won't spoil it for you...the ending may very well surprise you. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint deliver their finest performances in this final film; and they are supported by a perfectly cast ensemble, most of whom we've seen before...but there are a couple of new faces - Ciaran Hinds, as Dumbledore's brother, Alberforth; and Kelly McDonald as the ghost of Helena Ravenclaw. The special effects are stunning and David Yates work behind the camera is masterful. This is, bottom line, a brilliant work of art.

0061978078|4.0|I loved this follow up to Delirium. And as a side note, I think you should read this series in order. The second book references Alex, an important character from the first book, and the dystopian society is gone into into much more detail in the first book - you see Lena living in it.=, and get to go through her emotions as she becomes more aware of other possibilities.<br /><br />Now, in Pandemonium, Lena is a bit more clued in. She's tougher and stronger, but still retains some naivete, so her growth seems a natural progression - Lauren Oliver is a master at character development so I connected well with all the new people in this book. There's also a lot of action with just enough drama to make this book exciting! The twists and turns of the story, while slightly predictable at times, still drew me in and kept me reading well into the night. And that ending!!! Major cliffhanger alert! I for one HATE cliffhangers - but for some reason, this one left me excited to read the next book in the series, instead of annoyed and exclaiming in disgust, \\"No More!\\"

Especially if you like the music Aps that are available.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this product is a good choice for kids 11+ because  it's a fast Pace game that teaches kids hand coordination and how to have fun. But I also have seen it freeze and not update the daily challenge  when the day is up but overall it's a good game.

B005KELQEU|4.0|This is a nice protective cover.  The Kindle fits inside very well and the case has enough padding to do a good job of keeping it from harm.  The only drawback is the Kindle must be removed entirely from the cover to read.  The zipper does not extend all the way from top to bottom so you have to slip the Kindle out rather than open the case flat.
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|I wasted $30 purchasing a Harbor Freight brad nailer- it jammed or shot multiple brads just after one month of ownership and sparingly use.<br /><br />I selected this Makita because it has an all-Aluminum alloy body whereas other brands have incorporated various plastic parts and Makita's reputation for quality tools. After using this tool extensively  for over six months, I can confidently recommend this tool. It has never jammed or shot multiple brads. I'm so impressed with its performance that all my future nailers will be from Makita.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I knew what A Higher Call was about up front, yet found myself sucked into the dynamics of it to the point of obsession.  In-other-words once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down!  I kept thinking how the book needed to be turned into a movie.  Stories of chivalry, bravery, camaraderie, and shear determination peppered with respect, brought me again to reality and just how difficult WWII must have been for both sides, no matter ones political or religious standings.  I found myself getting a lump in my throat as read and on more than one occasion getting a little teary eyed.  This is a story we all wish or dream of; a story where a fighter pilot taught to kill his enemy at all costs, slips back into sanity right in the middle of a sure kill. He puts his killing desires on the back burner, sparing the lives of the men in the crippled war machine lined up in the center of his gun sight; bids them good bye and just that quick disappears in the skies to the East.  As if that isn't enough the ending if this great story trumps all else!  If you are someone interested in anything WWII then this book is a must for you -- I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
0765342294|1.0|I can only assume that those who said this is the greatest SciFi novel ever written have read only one SciFi novel. This novel is at best a challenging novel for YA. I do not understand how it won the Hugo and Nebula awards. There are so many flaws....basically Spartan boys in space.

B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann has it all - a stunningly beautiful voice that seems to have no limits to range or timbre, movie star good looks, perfect enunciation, and a brilliant actor.  Though his other recorded recitals have left no doubt that he is the `real thing', this recording devoted entirely to Wagner proves that fact even more conclusively.  He is ably supported by Donald Runnicles and the Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin and in both the operatic excerpts and the lieder the result is polished, exciting, dramatic, and simply magnificent singing.<br /><br />Though Kaufmann has established his place on the stages of the world as the definitive Wagnerian tenor in the Ring, Parsifal, and Lohengrin, here he adds arias from Tannh&auml;user and Rienzi - roles he has yet to assume.<br /><br />Of interest Kaufmann extends the Grail Narrative from Lohengrin to include the second verse - a verse Wagner cut before the premiere and which appears on recordings for the first time here. He is a brave step for Kaufmann but it does indeed demonstrate how immersed in Wagner's output he is. It is the most memorable version on records.<br /><br />There are many unforgettable moments in this recording, not the least of which is the triumphant moment from the Siegmund scene when he pulls the sword and sings full voice the extended notes of `W&auml;lse!'. There is such mighty power and breathtaking vocal production here that Kaufmann embodies the strength and determination and power of the young Siegmund.  It is an astonishing achievement. Another memorable moment his Kaufmann's offering of the prayer from Rienzi.<br /><br />And yet for all the virile excitement Kaufmann brings to the arias from Wagner's at times impossible operas, he draws upon in a different concept in singing the five Wesendonck Lieder - works usually intended for the female voice but here offered in the tenor range and the result is sublime. This album was especially recorded as an offering honoring Wagner's  anniversary year.  It could not be a better tribute.  The works included here are as follows:<br /><br />Ein Schwert verhie&szlig; mir der Vater from Die Walk&uuml;re<br />Da&szlig; der mein Vater nicht ist...Du holdes Voglein from Siegfried<br />Allm&auml;cht'ger Vater, blick herab from Rienzi<br /> Inbrunst im Herzen from Tannh&auml;user<br />Am stillen Herd from Die meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg<br />In fernem Land, unnahbar euren Schritten from Lohengrin<br />And the following Wesendonck Lieder:<br />Der Engel<br />Stehe still<br />Im Treibhaus<br />Schmerzen<br />Tr&auml;ume<br /><br />And now we await Kaufmann's recorded Parsifal.  He is the pinnacle of Wagnerian tenors, past and present.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, February 13y year.  It could not be a better tribute.

B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This has got to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The first 10 to 15 minutes hook you in with very honest torture scenes and riveting emotional responses acted out by Chastain. However the hour and a half that followed seemed very drawn out and flat as we follow Chastain chase lead after lead, going on nothing but her gut instinct. As I said in the title the acting done by Jessica Chastain was amazing and deserves all the praise she's gotten in response. But that's just about the only reason I'd ever recommend spending 160 minutes of your life on the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read.  I am a true dog lover and reading a story told from a dog's perspective really intrigued me.  I was not disappointed.

B004VYYA2K|2.0|My daughter is really starting to get into Barbies and we needed a place to put them. She received this item for Christmas and loved it. You can open the sides and it looks like the inside of a studio, the top lid is a pretend pool. After a few weeks of play and open-close though, the sides are starting to fold and crumple up. The lid still fits, but you have to adjust the side and 'squeeze' them, in order for it to fit properly. I really wished they had used a better material for the sides, it's such a great idea! We will be looking for another storage option.
B0031TZ8TU|4.0|Anyone who likes a book that holds their interest until the very last word will love reading almost anything by Ken Follett. This one differs from most of his others but is very exciting and interesting to the very end. This author deserves a try by anyone who has never read him.

B00AM2DL2U|4.0|I've never seen high school kids that were this intelligent and cerebral.  They acted more like 60's college students.  Kids need to realize life is dirty, very few of them will have an perfect childhood, stuff happens that is depressing and disturbing unless you are very sheltered.<br /><br />As far as the movie goes, Ezra Miller dominated and stole the show, it was hard to watch any of the other boring charactures.  I hope he will not be typecast after this.  Nothing lighthearted here, drifted downhill from childhood traumas and lots of negative underlying psychosis with the kids being their own psychiatrists to try and solve their emotional problems.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it answers the questions of many screwed up people \\"why didn't you go to college\\",  \\"why are you gay\\"  \\"why can't you make a normal relationship work or keep a job\\".  Steep cuts to mental health will rear it's ugly head.

B006MO0N6Y|3.0|I bought this set for the Bach disc, which has been impossible to get on CD.<br />For the rest of the set, although obviously there are good things, I would put these recordings pretty far down of my list of preferred versions.<br />The so-called champagne pianist plays brilliantly enough to bring down the roof, but for me his playing sometimes lacks poetry (perhaps what some call \\"unsentimental\\"), for instance in the breakneck tempi of most of the fast episodes of Schumann's Humoresque or the brutalized Arabeske by the same composer (try Horowitz' 1962 recording!). Other places, like in the 1st movement of the Tchaikovsky concerto, the speed is lethargic enough to evoke an image of somnambulant dinosaurs.<br />Much better, among the best in the box, are the Ravel, Prokofiev, and Gershwin concerti, where the music is \\"cool\\" to begin with and thus fits AW perfectly.<br />The Bach transcriptions are  wonderful and worth the price of the box alone.<br />The piano sound is often dry and hard, unlike EMI's English recordings of the time, which were better in all respects (eg the Barenboim Mozart concerti).<br />The Paris Salle Wagram may bear some of the blame perhaps, - it's even bluntly described in the booklet as having poor acoustics.<br />I might have enjoyed some of these recordings more if I hadn't heard so many better versions of the repertoire.<br />Fans will listen with different ears. A welcome relative rarity is the complete Schumann Album f&uuml;r die Jugend.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I love Josh Groban but the jury is still out on this one.  I've listened to the entire CD three times so far and there is no single song that jumps out at me.  Maybe I need to give it a little more time.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Ever since \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" ended, fans have been clamoring for \\"The Hobbit\\" to be adapted as well.<br /><br />Well, it took nine years of obstacles, but now we have \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\\" the first part of a trilogy of \\"Hobbit\\" movies. It has some few flaws, but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.<br /><br />Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.<br /><br />Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...<br /><br />At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.<br /><br />It took me two viewings of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd, and the second time I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.<br /><br />Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of \\"The Hobbit\\" (plus chunks of \\"Unfinished Tales\\") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.<br /><br />And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. It's brilliant.<br /><br />He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.<br /><br />However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.<br /><br />But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.<br /><br />And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast!<br /><br />The comedy can be a bit grating, but \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.urney. And the journey will only get more epic and dark.

1401937519|2.0|I was very disapointed in this book. The 5 star reviews had me sending off for the hardback immediately, and how I wish I hadn't bothered. The Near Death Experience is unconvincing, the idea we are all equal in God's eyes regardless of how we live our lives doesn't ring true and it is repetitive and boring boring boring. It has obviously been \\"plumped up\\" to make it the size of a regular novel and I would never recommend it to anyone.
0345529057|5.0|I've heard about the HBO series for a while and after hearing what the show was about I figured it would be something I'd like. After watching the first episode a friend recommended that I read the books first. I ended up finishing the first season because the episodes were so damn addicting. After I watching the first season I decided to purchase this box set and I couldn't be more happy with it. The books are extremely captivating and I have a hard time putting them down. I was also surprised by how closely the show seems to follow the book. There are even some lines I'll read and I swear that its the same words used in the series, verbatim. If the medieval era is even just a little bit interesting to you, there is no way you won't LOVE this series.
B00004SZWB|5.0|Who the he** is reviewing these albums,20 year olds and people who don't know Soul music? One review said overrated and The Jungle fever album was better than this and all other Stevie 80s album,yeah right kill yourself. The other said Master Blaster and Rocket Love were the only good songs. You need to listen to Do I Do,All I Do,Lately and Happy Birthday which were all hits. The other said it took 5 times to like it and that it was very 80s or something similar to that, nobody just listening to this 30 year old album should review it in my opinion. This album charted #1 on the US r&b and UK charts only Songs In The Key of Life did that,if you don't like it fine but the charts don't lie and the all around conscensus doesn't either. Stick to what you know and obviously it isn't R&B/Soul music.

0061726834|4.0|In the future, love or \\"delirium\\" has been cured. At the age of 18, each person will be cured of the disease, and ushered into a structured and secure life without love and the complications that come with it. In Lena's world, love has been blamed as the root reason for many of the world's greatest problems from famine to war - and the only way to control the infection, is to remove it early.<br /><br />Delirium gave me all the swoons. It's a beautiful story about a young girl who discovers not only love for the first time, but also herself. That ancient part of her that has always known something was not right in the society she lived in. The romance between Alex and Lena was delicate and raw, and the issues that Lena faces while trying to decide which path she should follow are completely breathtaking.<br /><br />The ending was like running as fast as you can to the edge of a cliff and being forced to stop right on the edge. My heart was racing, I felt nervous for Lena, and I couldn't wait to download the sequel!<br /><br />Audiobooks can be tricky things, I've decided a huge amount of it comes down to who is narrating it. Luckily, the narrator of Delirium (Sarah Drew) did an amazing job. For some reason, it sounded like Mandy Moore was reading to me for some parts of it, if that gives you a better idea of the tone of voice. The narration in this one completely made the book for me, I'm not so sure I would have enjoyed it nearly as much had I been reading it the traditional way!
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|This is a great live CD.  Some of the solos run a bit long as is typical with live performances, but overall, the CD was really enjoyable.
0439023513|4.0|I'd tried a few times to pick up this book to read. I listened to the first two in the series on audiobooks during cross-country road trips that my husband and I took - so it felt strange to then pick up the third and read it in physical form. Finally, I got my hands on a copy of the Mockingjay audiobook, and got a chance to find out how the series would turn out. I'll make sure not to include any spoilers for those of you still working your way through the series!<br /><br />I've read quite a few negative reviews about this third installment in the Hunger Games trilogy, and I'm very happy to report that I don't agree with any of them. It wasn't quite as thrilling as the first two, I will admit. But this final installment wasn't as much about creating conflict and relationships like the first two were, but rather it served the purpose of finally wrapping up Katniss' battle against the Capitol. I admit, there wasn't as much romantic payoff as I was looking for. After two books, I was waiting to see who Katniss would choose, and when and IF she would finally come to her senses and realize she's madly in love with Peeta. (DUH!)<br /><br />But, that just wasn't what this one was about. And I guess it would cheapen the whole series, and the character of Katniss herself, to suggest that she would dedicate much time or energy to digging through her confused romantic feelings when she still has a personal war happening between herself and the Capitol - so for that reason, I was okay with the lack of Peeta/Gale/Katniss story line.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there was plenty happening in this one. Lots of explosions, tragedies, a couple points where I definitely felt my stomach drop when something totally out of the blue happened. I found myself actually looking forward to getting to work each day where I'd be able to listen to this audiobook. And it sure made the time fly by!<br /><br />These days, it seems harder to find a series that stays true to itself the entire waythrough. And in my opinion, the Hunger Games did just that. Mockingjay was exactly what was needed to end this series, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I still am a girl but what the heck its awesome and it is sooooooooooooo adicting like icecream but cooler and candy but sweeter.:-) :D
B00632HWOG|5.0|I get around my email with ease. I like how it syncs quickly with my other devices (desktop).  The only problem I have it there are two infinate outgoing emails...????  They are not on my desktop, just my kindle.  weird.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|go who ever made this is awesome!!:) ;) so make a third temple run better and it would be the bobm
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Amazing that after all the changes, deaths, times gone by that these guys got together with a brand new album in 2012. Every tune here is new, and not a dud among them! --Bill and Sue--with its calypso beat ,and oddball lyrics (check the very end) certainly is a new sound for these guys.--Strange World--another nifty tune, among many...My two favorites are at the very end --Pacific Coast Highway, just about the perfect song - most definitely rates as a timeless art-song, and you can interpret the lyrics in many ways. Just a sublime piece thruout, though probably too short! and--Summers' Gone-- the perfect follow-up...Both somewhat reminiscent of \\"Till I Die\\", and \\"Surf's Up\\"  from over 40 years ago..And the old BBoy harmonies survive intact this long! I think Brian really did a wonderful album here, and even the pictures (including long-lost David Marks, who was an original on their first 4 albums back in 1962-63..think about that for a second!)..Plus the others who also helped write some of the songs; and the lyrics are printed in the fine notebook. A really refreshing and timeless sound here on most of the tunes (true, one or two may thump a bit much for this oldster approaching geezerdom)...Both worth it if only for the last 2 on the CD! (plus a lot more!)
B007X70NVO|5.0|The movie did a great job of presenting a narrative that humanized the gladiators of the sport. Something in this production for everyone - get to know the characters, the psychology, the families, the uber engineering, the tragedy and heartache, and the ultimate drive, determination, and superhuman attributes of those that somehow rise to the top of this incredible sport.
B000HWXTXQ|5.0|This movie is something I didn't expect the creators of the original to do. To take and change the whole thing from America to Tokyo is very different. Then add in the fact of the crew being mostly different people puts the twist into the plots. A great movie to add to my collection.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|I have been reading all of the Harry Bosch novels in order and, if I had read this one first, I doubt I would have read the others. Harry is always the loner and, in this book, he seems to miss the company of a woman. However, he listens to no one. Not even his partner, as usual. The fact that cesium has been stolen and Harry has to solve a murder doesn't change the fact that Harry always prioritizes with his solving his murder cases as first priorities. This book was much shorter than the others and was less involved. I wish I'd read some of the 3 stars before purchasing this one.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|I even can not understand why people don't watch this show. This show is awesome. You don't want to miss one single episode. gorgeous, thrilled, HBO strikes again!
B005LAII94|3.0|I thought it would be better by what I had heard but, it's OK! Just a recycled Drug trafficing story!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Tarantino knows what he is doing. VERY WELL. I watched this movie twice in theater, but I also want to have it! If you like Tarantino, this never let you down
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Great Movie! Not one boring minute during the whole show. If you've never seen it you're missing out! Plenty of Action!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I usually don't watch fantasy movie or tv show. but this show is.. i can not wait for 3rd season! I just dont know why 2nd season dvd released this late.
B004QL7K70|5.0|This is a very Funny movie. If you like Movies like Super Bad or American Pie you will like this. Much better than The Hangover!
B009O07NMA|5.0|Hello everyone, Amazon ask me what I thought of my recent purchase. Florida Georgia Line<br />If you liked the singles off this album you will enjoy the rest of the cd. Good beat fun lyrics its a good purchase.
B005QJZ5FA|3.0|I bought this CD to get two songs I liked. Turns out they are the only two good songs on the CD!
B002V6RB1C|5.0|this is one of the best movies ever made, paul newman has a spectacular performance as luke, and the supporting cast around him is superb.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I use this app regularly and it hasn't let me down yet. I bought it instantly as I liked the look of it and it presented me with all the info I needed to keep my Kindle working.
B008A5TL2U|5.0|This product came in very quickley at an excellent price.  It was brand new fully wrapped.<br /><br />I would recommmend this product to anyone.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love jewels star this game and have played if for hours.  I would recommend.  There are so many levels it keeps you wanting more
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't stop watching this show. I was not in to TV shows I thought zombies and etc... well.. I gave it a chance and now I'm totally into that. I also love the music!!!
0307346617|1.0|Bought this book after reading reviews. But it was wordy and very hard to follow. Not what I was expecting
B004T2QZL8|5.0|J thought this was going to be a drawing app but I wasn't dissapointed to find that it wasn't. ...so addictive! good job and so original!:)
1892005034|5.0|This should be required reading for everyone in a relationship of any kind.<br />Really helps you learn how to focus on hearing the other person which gets you to the bottom of what is really going on.<br />Too many people speak too quick and take things personally without realizing that its not you.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted app. The object of the game is very cool and interesting and once you start playing the game is quite addictive. Great app and lovely graphics on my kindle display.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This was a fantastic deal on an awesome trilogy of movies, it shipped relatively fast, so I don't really have any complaints whatsoever. Extremely happy with this purchase.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is a wonderful app for taking notes in a college enviroment or using it just to remember everyday tasks. it's like your own personally tablets without the extra weight of carring multiple notebooks. It's a great app.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|One of the most tedious films i have ever seen. I knew nothing about it before i went in  ...  I watched it in the morning at the movies so sadly i had nothing to imbibe whilst watching it ... but it sure did make me crave for some release from the ennuii.<br /><br />The best scene was the mini bar at the hotel - It was like the portals of heaven opening :)<br /><br />Now where's my drink ..
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|disney pixar has really made alot of great movies and this one is no exception. It has beautifully crafted characters with intriguing peronalities and it tells a moral and a story between family, choices, bravery and more. It is a blast to watch and is great for the entire family.
030758836X|2.0|The book I must say started out very good. I enjoyed the first half of the book.  Finding out that Amy was really who everyone believed she was was a great aspect to this book. What lost me was how long everything dragged on for. All the unnecessary filler this books had, like everything with Andie. I get that she was a factor but come, do we really need 400 + pages of this book. I think not.<br /><br />The ending to me was the worst ending. I know sometimes it's fine to have the bad guy get away with something but to have her get away with everything and have her get her own way and still have Nick forced to be with her, it's all just too much negativity.  It was sad and depressing. It made me want to not read anything by her again. Believe me when I say it horrible to feel powerless. I know from personal experience. I read her other novels and I really enjoyed them. Not too long with just the right amount of justice and still have the main character be kinda emotionally messed up. But in gone girl, there's no vindication. She doesn't pay for anything. It was just bad, just bad,  I would not recommend this for reading.  I was getting so frustrated with this book that I started skipping parts just to get through it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love this show!  Although I have a hard time passing up anything that has Joshua Jackson in it.  The guy that plays Walter Bishop is an awesome actor!  Sorry to see Charlie go, though.  Dr. Bishop has great musical taste, love hearing whatever they are playing in the lab.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I love this series. I am so glad I bought it.It was  so worth the price.<br /><br />You will love it too.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I surprised my husband with this. He had loved this show, and had even taken me to see Serenity for one of our dates. So when I found the whole series on blu-ray I was very excited. The whole process was great - ordering, receiving, and the blu-ray is wonderful. Plus now I don't have to sit through Firefly marathons on the Science channel. (What Firefly has to do with the &#34;Science&#34; channel is beyond me anyhow.)
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This was a great movie that kept me entertained from start to finish.<br />The acting was good, it has an all star cast...be a great gift for someone!
0375507256|5.0|Saw the movie, had to read the book. Loved BOTH, book is better of course, but movie I thought was well done
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wow, as usual Flynn writes a good book. This is her third murder/mystery and I'm impressed. I'm not as thrilled as I was with the first 2 but this one is still \\"a thinker\\" one of those books you put down and can't actually shake for a few days.<br />There is a large amount of reviews so I will make it short and sweet.<br /><br />If you like mystery, horror, thriller, psychological suspense...you will like this book. If you like fluid quick writing with symbolism and complex characters -- you will like this book.<br /><br />Warning: SPOILERS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br />Amy : first half of the book, is completely likable, you are a little annoyed at how easily she puts up with certain things in her relationship but you feel kind of bad for her. You sympathize and relate.<br /><br />Amy's Hubby: he's a cheater with grand dreams and not any success. He like Amy are both very good looking...you want to slap him in the beginning, but as Flynn always does she draws you in. She makes you see things from the characters point of view, you start to like him, start to feel bad for him.<br /><br />Plot: the first half of the book you are wondering \\"what happened to Amy?\\" is she dead, who killed her; there is more than one character that makes you go hmmmmmmm?<br /><br />BOOM: second half of the book...Amy is a total psychopath. Everything you thought you knew about Amy isn't true; everything you thought you knew about the people who are suspects in her disappearance isn't true. Everything is turned upside down and on its head. Bravo to the writer on this. Nice twist.<br /><br />Yes...I said spoilers but I still don't want to give too much away, because what's the put of mystery if there isn't one???<br /><br />The one and only thing I didn't like about this book was the end. Not that it wasn't a good ending it was just upsetting. SPOILER..... After all Amy puts her husband thru and those around her, there is no justice, she goes on...just as sick and as evil as ever. Her husband is trapped, like a spider in web. As much as I wanted Amy to pay for her sick twisted behavior. As much as I was annoyed -- I will admit...it's an unsuspected ending and it's creepy. Something else that this writer is good at. The creepy factor. Her books are more psychological horror to me. They always start out like a mystery, but they always take on a horror factor. Unsettling.<br /><br />Great writer...look forward to her other books! Great Vaca or weekend read. Certainly worth the $.s trapped, like a spider in web. As much as I wanted Amy to pay for her sick twisted behavior. As much as I was annoyed -- I will admit...it's an unsuspected ending and it's creepy. Something else that this writer is good at. The creepy factor. Her books are more psychological horror to me. They always start out like a mystery, but they always take on a horror factor.

B003K07DUC|3.0|Not on scale with a lot of the great Matt Damon action flicks. Tells a good story. Slightly boring.  Worth the small price though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like it I would tell my friends to try it out.!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I' m glad you have a game like this.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This app is very entertaining and good way to pass the time.  Challenging at times and great visually. For a free app it a good one to have in your collection.
B00AQM85YK|5.0|This book lasts over the centuries as the themes it touches on are relevant now, themes to do with technology, medical science and its creation of life as we see in the present day with cloning. It is extraordinary to think that Mary Shelley was so young when she wrote it; only 18 years old and staying with her illicit lover Percy Shelley and Lord Byron at Lake Geneva,. Interesting to note that most people think the monster is called Frankenstein, which he is not. Read the book and find out who is and then make your own analysis as to why most people make that mistake.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|it is fun for a little while ...<br />but there is no point to it.I guess its fun. not the best
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my PC, my cell and now my Kindle. It works great and I have no problems with it...
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is really fun. Not only it,s multiplayer. A family fun game. Buy it and see if you like it. Mystery Man out!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been using the same AP on my mobile phone for quite a while now.  This is the best Bible program on the market, and it's FREE!  They are continually upgrading this AP too.  I got this AP for my NextBook tablet and it works great on this device as well.  The only thing that I would like to add, our church uses the NRSV version of the Bible in church and this AP doesn't have it.  I still give it a 5 Star rating because it is that good. I highly recommend it!
1401322786|5.0|I loved this book, a little hard to jump around though.  I have read all the Albom books and am never disappointed.  Looking forward to next one. Thanks
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The most inspirational book I have ever read. I also had similar experiences and found his descriptions, words I've been<br />looking for.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was an great read.  It goes by fast and I was left wishing there was more.  I had a warm fuzzy feeling reading this.
B00A655N8I|3.0|Rather than shell out the high price for this version, I downloaded half the tracks from e music. This is the Great Gergiev after all and perhaps a Russian bass would give us a Hunding to die for.<br />To begin on a positive note, everything is beautifully played and sung. All the notes are there for sure. The SOUND is terrific with incredible balance between singers and orchestra.I cannot fault the musicians or engineers ... a great production job!<br />Now for the problems. Where is Wagner? Where is the drama? Where are glorious moments? Hunding doesn't growl. Brünnhilde doesn't whoop. They don't seem to understand the great theatre in all of this. It is truly DULL!<br />I suggest you spend a third of the dollars and get Leinsdorf with George London as the Wanderer and Jon Vickers as Siegmund. Both Leinsdorf and Solti (in his famous Vienna version), bring out the drama and excitement. It's NOT just about beautiful singing and playing. If it's beauty you desire, go for the Karajan. (I love both these famous Ring's but for different reasons ... Solti for drama and Karajan for the sound.)<br /> Two good all-round Ring Cycles (and the least expensive)  are Bohm and  Janowski . Grab one of them while they remain bargains.<br /><br /> If you are looking for one great Die Walkure, I would recommend the Leinsdorf with the London Symphony on DECCA.<br /><br />In summary ... three stars ... five for the sound and maybe 1 star for the performance ... a true disappointment considering what could have been!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a wonderful way to watch Downton Abbey ... get the full season ... or 2 ... or 3!.
B000S0GYRU|1.0|Second disk was broken but I had worked so many back to back doubles that by the time I caught up on my sleep it was days later I decided to take loss because I had no way of proving that is how it came so I just keep it .
B000065U1N|5.0|I have seen this movie many times, and I will safely say it ranks up with the best war movies ever made. Ridley Scott outdid himself with this movie, every bit was executed with perfect detail. The action, cinematography, acting and realism was all incredible.<br /><br />This movie is based off a 1993 US raid on the Somalian capital Mogadishu to capture a brutal warlord  Mohamed Farrah Aidid. He had starved hundreds of thousands of his own people to death and the US government decided to intervene and capture him. The raid was a fiasco as they had underestimated the Somalis strength.<br /><br />What I loved most about this movie was its realistic portrayal of the soldiers, as is shows them wanting to help the Somalis but doesn't show them as overconfident and cocky. This movie has a big cast so there isn't a lot of character depth, but it gives enough time to show who the men are and manages to show their humanity.<br /><br />The action scenes in this movie are very intense and realistic, and the camera work and cinematography was beautiful and crisp. The acting is also spot on, as the cast makes you feel like your watching real soldiers act in the situation. Another great commodity of this movie is Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, as it is haunting, dramatic and very fitting for the story.<br /><br />This movie is something war movie and action fans will definitely enjoy, so do get a copy of this if you have to chance.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great an ending to wait for<br />Loved it ...can't wait for the other movies bring then on please. Thank you
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I found myself skimming just to get through it.  I could not get behind the characters or the story for that matter.
B001HN6922|3.0|It was shipped to late for Christmas but I gave it to the little boy after anyway.He was happy to get it.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|This series keeps getting better!  Love all of the new scenarios and surprises! Keeps me in my seat and leaves me wanting more!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not really sure why this book gained such a large following.  Not so great in my book.  Even the steamy parts felt anticlimactic for my liking.  Wouldn't bother recommending this at all.
0756666937|5.0|My son is a huge Lego fan - and this book met and exceeded all expectations. Wonderful book and highly recommend it for any Lego Lover!
B0099G6Q5E|2.0|the bass is too low, and the gerneral sound quality is poor.  It sounds like it was recorded with a low budget or something?
B005LAII8K|5.0|I really did enjoy this movie. My wife said she loved it and wanted to own it so I bought it for her. She and I loved the movie. A+
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|The order came in very good time. I watched the entire season in a week. Great quality, amazing show! I will definitely be buying season 2!
B004R6JG7G|5.0|Its an 80's classic that wont disappoint. I am more than happy to recommend it to everyone who likes 80's movies!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very much like temple run only so much better in both graphics and gameplay the controls are a lot smoother and more responsive then temple run as well
B008J34466|5.0|Love this CD & every song on it. I've played it over and over.  Her perspective on love is interesting, unique and laugh out loud funny at times!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one habit forming game. It will make you play for hours or until you run your battery down.
B0000029DD|1.0|I have a very open mind when it comes to music, but I have to say this is the worst excuse for music I have ever, ever heard! I don't mind going to the musical dark side every now & then and getting down and dirty with the pain, but this was beyond that! I threw the CD out after listening once.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is a book that is extremely interesting in helping you realize why you or other people do what they do in the form of habits and some habits you don't even realize are habits!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was a totally waste of time. The characters were never developed, and there was no real story line. The ending was abrupt, with no real conclusion or finish to it. Perhaps the author did this so we would be intrigued enough to buy the sequels?  Not me. Still wondering how such a poorly written book could sell so many copies?  I guess sex sells no matter what. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Stayed close to the book, nice lead in to the second book.  The whole package is in excellant shape, just like new.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This is a great show, and a good way to buy it.  We like it better than keeping track of discs.  We watch via a DSL connection, without problems.
B0026KX4HS|4.0|Movie was great to watch. We had a great time watching this movie.  You should watch this movie also.  Because I said.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I enjoyed this very much.  I've been a fan of Barbra's since 1965 and it's always a treat to hear new songs from the different periods of her life.
B00846F1YW|4.0|When scenes are in the dark, I get &quot;guesses &quot; when I touch the screen to move the flashlight .  Anyone else have this problem?  Any suggestions?  (Other than that, I really like the game!)
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|It's a fuuny and sweet movie which can be enjoyed by children as well as adults.  i do recommend it.
1451695195|5.0|If you feel there is no hope, there is HOPE in God.  After reading this book it makes me excited to think about going to heaven.  God is full of love and forgiveness, more than we as humans could EVER imagine.  Not everyone is going to believe, because not everyone throughout the history of the world and Bible believed.  It's human nature, it is the FREE WILL that God gave each one of us.  WE have to CHOOSE to follow Him.  Choose to follow Him and see the HOPE come alive in your life.  It will happen, God is a God of Love and Hope...We just have to yield our stubborn spirit to Him.  Read it!!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|It wasn't what I was expecting, but so much more. The story jeeps you entertained and the end will keep you wanting.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It is SO much better than MIB II. It's not quite as good as the first, but still very entertaining!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I really like this now that it is on my tablet also.  No problems with it.  I would highly recommend it.
B006903GX8|3.0|Very interesting read for a downton fan, but it is poorly structured. Beautiful pictures, but the captions seem unorganized in the kindle edition.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wouldn't miss Downton Abbey.  I don't watch much TV but I love this show....it has something for everybody, drama and humor., can be predictable but is well written and great actors involved.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book  and indeed the trilogy, leaves you with that seriously unsettled feeling, most often experienced when one can relate to the tragic underpinnings of an all-too-real, albeit exaggerated, take on the world we live in.  The concepts are cruel and harsh and take the reader to many emotional places.<br /><br />I cannot say that this book or the trilogy is pleasant or heart warming. I can say however, that it is necessary.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Used to listen to him when I was a teenager (am a senior now) and so it was for old times sake, we got it but did not enjoy it as much as we had expected to.
B000HKYBXA|5.0|if every American watched this movie, our country would be that much better off.  Branagh's performance is truly awe inspiring.  Hollywood, move over...you can't hold a candle to this man.  He is THE single greatest actor alive today, bar none.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Product received as advertised would do business with seller again, Thanks
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's not fair to end a book before the ending !!!  I loved it despite the fact that I'm very angry !!!
0394721772|4.0|I have used the Vol 1 of Julia's book multiple times but don't find this second volume to be as useful.  Still, she does have some excellent tips and recipes that I've yet to use so maybe in time it will grow on me.  Volume 1 is still the best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. I own many horses on this game that I couldn't own in real life. This game has great graphics!

B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a fun search game. I had no problems running it on the galaxy note 10. The game is exatly as advertised.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|This is a good film, not a great film, or one you will remember forever. Brad Pitt's performance is one of his best. You could stitch together more of the storyline between the lines, and maybe that is what the director wanted here. Otherwise, he could have dropped some of the film on the cutting floor and not missed much. Still, better then most films out there today.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game I Eva played its so fun and I cant put my device down mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine mine craft

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Always had pride in our Navy Seals but more so now. Helps you to understand how their lives are effected and yet how thankful that there are men and women out their protecting us so unselfishly.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app has great graphics. really cool game for horse lovers and kids. nothing else like this is as good.
B009LA6US6|1.0|Unbelievable! In the very beginning of this \\"annotated\\" edition its authors quote (presumably, from Wikipedia) biography of the WRONG author! They mix up Robert Chambers and his brother William, Scottish scientists and writers, with Robert William Chambers, american novelist, who actually wrote these stories.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for the sample, for after such a beginning I doubt that this book is worth even a dollar and a single minute of time.
0375869026|5.0|(Written by my student):  I read this book when I was in 5th grade, and I finished it the same day I started it. The last 50 pages were agony because I did not want it to end. Auggie Pullman is a boy who has a facial deformity. He goes to school for the first time in 5th grade. The Principal of the school assigns three students to take Auggie on a tour and be his friends. This book is really different from any book I have ever read, because it has themes from different people in Auggie's life - his sister, his friends at school, his sister's boyfriend -- telling about their point of view and their thoughts about Auggie. I really liked this because, when you only focus on one person's thoughts, you never know about the other person's point of view. In this book, you get to know what other people are thinking.<br />  The ending is so good. I am not going to reveal it - you will have to read the book yourself. But I will say, I was in tears. You probably will be, too.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I am so in love with album. Lana Del Ray is amazing. Beautiful voice. So unique. With the Amazon MP3 app I have the song on my phone. Very convenient.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I really wanted tried to like this, but if this is what getting old means, I am not looking forward to it.
B002POMLHY|5.0|I haven't bought any new music in the past few years. I was happy with this album and really cant wait to buy more from this band.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I really liked the twists and turns in this movie. Very basic in design, but very rich in thought. five stars
B00005N6KG|5.0|LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  SHIPPER WAS FAST AND EFFICIENT.  ORDER ARRIVED EARLY.  WOULD DEFINATELY USE THIS SHIPPER AGAIN. NO PROBLEMS AT ALL
B00498XRPE|5.0|Can watch this movie over and over the theather verson show a lot. Of deleted scenes. I was also really satifised because it does show parts from pumethesis that new movie they added for the alien serios.
030746363X|5.0|FAST EFFICIENT SERVICES FROM SHIPPER.  I ADDED THIS TO MY LIBRARY ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT READ IT YET.  WOULD USE THIS SHIPPER AGAIN
1432794426|5.0|This is my 2nd Michael Jackson book and I was thoroughly engrossed from page 1.<br />Thank you to Dr Moriarty for putting Michaels life in perspective for those of us<br />who love and miss him.<br /><br />Highly reccomended read for any MJ fan!!
B004GYY714|5.0|There were loads of British station to choose from.<br />One of my favorite's  was NME station really great selection of mostly Alt Rock lots of new stuff as well as older classics.<br />Nice little app especially for free no commercials and great music you cant beat that.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I really enjoy this series and what dynamic characters drive the action and suspense. While the plot is a bit of a stretch, the story is fast-paced and an excellent read. You have to love Mitch Rapp!
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate reminds us that the world is filled with uncertainty (more so than what we realize) and puts us on a path to evaluating what we hear, understanding why these predictions fail; and gives us a primer into the world of statistics. Too many of us make decisions by chasing false signals. This is a perfect companion read with Kahneman's &#34;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#34;. Read this by the man who could have spared us month's of political speculation about who would be the 2012 President of the United States. Nate knew.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I can't remember exactly how it started but I have &#34;reached&#34; one book at a time, totally out of sequence, and always find myself reading another and another in this excellent series. The only question is how you possibly cast Tom Cruise as the lead character in ANY Reacher novel.....yeesh.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I really like this case; the black elastic band was missing from the package when I received it though. I would recommend it regardless.
B000002H97|5.0|older music group that had a great run. this album is one of their best. try it. you won't be disappointed.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|One of his better efforts. Classic Dylan song writing and beat.  Reminded me of Slow Train Album.  You will not be disappointed.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Kids love it, what more needs to be said? Oh, I enjoyed it too. Good hearted fun with the return of the muppets and some quality kids actors.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I bought this used and it was like new! It plays great! Fast shipping too! It's my favorite disney movie and it was nice not to have to pay an arm and a leg for it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game works great but the ads are very annoying...I would prefer to pay for something without them...would have been nice to have a choice.<br />i
B00005V9HH|5.0|it was a gift to one of my relatives n he loved it. he especially liked that it was special edition
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I do not have any children, but I enjoyed this movie immensely. Younger children might not get all the jokes, but they will probably still enjoy the story. I would recommend Hotel Transylvania for anyone with a sense of humor who enjoys: classic monster stories (Dracula, Frankenstein, etc,) family stories, or cute, clean romances.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a calculator. Nothing really special. It's just a simple easy to use calculator that does the basic four functions. It would be nice to have scientific functions bu<br />is free, so you get what you pay for.
B009JBZH54|5.0|So, you find yourself with some chick that needs the broad horizon of 'comic book movies' opened up for her over a bottle of Pinot Noir?  Batman Begins.<br /><br />Maneuver the conversation into the sad conclusion to Heath Ledger;s life and don't want to be forced into watching A Knight's Tale?  the Dark Knight.<br /><br />You want some motivation for the gym because you blew it with that aforementioned chick and want to try again?  Dark Knight Rises.<br /><br />Bam.  Best $30 bucks you can spend.
B004X4QVSO|5.0|My son loves this movie.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I love Bruce Lee and his kung fu legend.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|This movie has a good combination of humor for the kids and humor for the adults too.  Lots of fun
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Im very sad to finish all the episodes so far. Phil you rule sir. Take the jump and watch these. You wont regret it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I got this to read on my kindle because of a recomendation.  At first it was kind of blah, then I hated her, then I hated him, then I hated both of them.  Now I think they are just so weird.  Read it in two nights and so glad I did.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|I have difficulty falling asleep. The shorter meditations were not successful,but the longest one went past the time I slept.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game challenge yourself to beat your own record. easy accurate i highly recommend this game. chck your speed and skill.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is a most unusual book. There are 6 stories in different times spanning several hundred years including the distant future. The stories have a tenuous thread running through them, but this is not the major feature of the book. It's better to treat them as different stories while reading and then think deeply about it afterwards. Once you get used to the mid-sentence switch from one story to another it is easy to become absorbed by the book. The characters are richly drawn and you start to care what happens to them from the outset. It is the kind of book you won't forget in a hurry, unlike a lot of formula books these days. It demands deeper thought. This book is highly recommended to people who are looking for something different. It's a deep, thought-provoking novel on the one hand, and a series of ripping yarns on the other hand.
1781161313|1.0|The pictures and technical drawings are so awful, basic, and generic - I've seen cooler illustrations in a Geo Prism technical manual.  Whoever put this out should be ashamed.<br />There's nothing in this book for anyone to enjoy.  Unless you have a box of markers and a lot of free time.<br />POS!
0385486804|3.0|In the begin of this semester, our teacher strongly suggest us to read this story, so I will do that later.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Really like the game! Holds my attention, challenges my skills -  and I love the graphic tiles! The only downside is that it isn't easy to quit the game -  I wish there was a &#34;quit&#34; button on the main menu. It takes a long time for me to hit the display in the right spot to bring up the menu bar on the kindle fire.
B001FXCE46|3.0|Ah, Kings of Leon. What else can be said about this group that hasn't already been said. First, for newcomers: Kings of Leon is a perfect example of the theory that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You won't find great musical virtuosos in this group, like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, that carry the band on their shoulders. You won't find intricate lyrics. But, somehow, Kings of Leon makes it work.<br /><br />The key is lead writer and singer Caleb. His voice is very unique and he brings a certain lyricism to the songs. His songs have a sense of time and place.<br /><br />I would write the above for all their albums. What's special about this one? Well, it contains their two biggest breakthrough hits: Sex on Fire and Use Somebody. Good songs but rather mainstream. They've got other strong songs (Revelry, Manhattan) on this album and Caleb even says in their documentary (link below) that he was very surprised that Sex on Fire was chosen as a hit single to promote.<br /><br />So what is it about this group? Decent songs, although you'll find yourself skipping a few to get to songs like Revelry. These boys should be played with the windows rolled down and time in front of you. I'd give it 3.5 if possible, but this isn't the next U2.<br /><br />But songs like Revelry and Closer are really good. You get a certain sense of place and feeling with Caleb's voice and lyrics. He's honest and talks of real people in real places. I give it 3 out of 5 cause there needs to be more depth to their music.<br /><br />By the way, they have a must-see documentary out: [...]. Regardless of whether you like their music, you must see this. It's a slice of America and worthwhile on its own, apart from the music.
B006ZZANDI|4.0|I was super excited when I recieved this album, but It was barely a yearbook! There could have been more pages! The song were really good.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I so love the Harry Potter sound tracks. As much as I love the movies. I listen to them all of the time.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I'll be honest:  this isn't something I would have started watching on my own.  My girlfriend started watching it on Netflix and urged me to check it out.<br /><br />There's certainly A LOT of moments where they throw in un-needed drama (soap opera style), but overall the characters and story are very interesting.
B00006IR5S|5.0|I so love the Harry Potter sound tracks. As much as I love the movies. I listen to them all of the time.
B002YDTPHA|2.0|This is a gore fest.  No plot, silly and chaotic.  I really had a hard time sitting through this movie.
B00005V6OD|5.0|I so love the Harry Potter sound tracks. As much as I love the movies. I listen to them all of the time.
B000YHE9J2|3.0|From the trailer of this movie, I expected it to be really good.  I thought the ending was a little confusing.
B0000DZ3EN|1.0|I cannot believe this was associated to one of the best movies of all time. Felt I needed to be on something to understand it or appreciate its strangeness!
B009MO5G90|3.0|purchase movie to play on my samsung web based 3d blu ray player only to find out about samsungs incompatibility with a lot of blu ray titles. but that was not the movies fault. still i watched on ps3 in 3d and wasn't  totally impressed. it's a decent movie and the 3d in sokay. not as good as some movies but i am still glad to make  the puchase.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Filthy verbiage!  Story would have been okay without the filth!  I am definitely not a prude but this was too much!
B008NEMPTO|3.0|not the greatest 3d but still worth it. story seems to drag on and i found myself not wanting to finish movie.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Bought this speedlight for my D5000 to replace an old Sunpak that finally died after 30+ year. The features and quality of the SB-700 is amazing. The interaction  with the camera and resulting images are second to none. I would recomment getting the SC-29 TTL remote cord for added flexibily. Also, I highly  recommend buying and viewing the DVD &#34;Nikon Speedlight for the SB-700&#34; by Blue Crane Digital. The video shortens the learning time and contains valuable tips on how to get the most out of your Speedlight.
B0073U2F12|1.0|waited a long time to buy this as some of the reviews were not so good. after i bought i realized i was glad to spend less the 10.00  price for it. its an okay story but that isn't totally what your buying. we were buying the 3d experience, and boy does not deliver. i own almost all 3d blu rays and this one ranksat the bottom
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book. Typical Nicholas Sparks storyline.  I am looking forward to the movie coming out. They should have edited the book to match the cover. In the book the lead character has blonde hair that she dyes brown. On the cover she is still a blond!
B004YJMQCS|5.0|i waited a long time to buy this as some of the reviews were not so good. after i bought i realized i would have paid full price for it. its an okay story but that isn't totally what your buying. we were buying the 3d experience, and boy does it deliver. i own almost all 3d blu rays and this one ranks up there with the best of them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's still great this season.  I've watched all three seasons in the last couple of weeks and every one is great.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|don't buy this if your expecting decent or better 3d. i only paid same price as blu ray but still disappointing .
B00APUQJLO|2.0|I'm a big fan of RPatz and he has a lot of talent in a wide variety of genres but this movie was bad.  Not the acting but the book itself.  I don't know how Don DeLillo gets such acclaim as a writer because I didn't get the book and I didn't get it in movie form.
B008518MOW|4.0|waited a long time to buy this as some of the reviews were not so good. after i bought i realized i would have paid full price for it. its an okay story but that isn't totally what your buying. we were buying the 3d experience, and boy does it deliver. i own almost all 3d blu rays and this one ranks up there with the best of them.
B007REV4YI|1.0|Copying my e-mail to feedbackus@fox.com:<br /><br />Your Blu-ray disc gives an error of unlicensed for playback in my Blu-ray player, a new purchase this Christmas.<br /><br />Your Digital Copy mechanism does not work, at-all. I cannot play the movie in iTunes.<br /><br />I'm getting my money back.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />David Goodnow
B008XBCJ34|5.0|i loved this movie from start to finish. decent 3d. not a lot of in your face stuff but great depth with great visuals.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|This works I've lost weight & have integrated the plan into daily living, appears to be flexible and sensible way to lose weight. Would have preferred a bit more of the science behind it but I guess the research is still quite young. Should really be read in conjunction with viewing the BBC Horizon program by Mosely. The female dietician trots out all the usual advice to go along with the plan and the book is padded out by repeating claims and effusive comments. In essence its a plan to limit your calorie intake but doesnt use celebrity fads and seems to have a scientific basis which explains the health benefits to be gained ( not opinions, but facts from scientific investigation). Watch the video if you can , read the book, and try it, if it works for you ....brilliant. 5 stars if the science was more prominent/mature and more recipes were included....it'll take years to prove that this also aids life expectancy and limits the vagaries of growing old BUT it is the most sensible easy to follow weight loss program I've heard or read about.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|one of the worst 3d acquisitions in my library. already had this on dvd. movie was originally releases in imax 3d but this conversion stinks. don';t waste your money for it if wanted too add to your 3d library.don't take this the wrong way. i love the movie but 3d is a waste. i own other 3d movies (almost every title in blu ray 3d). and this one and darkest hour are the worst.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great show and season 2 was VERY good! It is a must see! Much better than season 1 (although I loved both).
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|waited a long time to buy this as some of the reviews were not so good. after i bought i realized i would have paid full price for it. its an okay story but that isn't totally what your buying. we were buying the 3d experience, and boy does it deliver. i own almost all 3d blu rays and this one ranks up there with the best of them.
B0033TJATW|5.0|It is done very well, shipped fast and works great! I had been looking for this for a long time and it is just how I remembered it as a kid! I am so glad I got it!
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|Much more historically-minded than 'Band of Brothers', the Pacific effectively gives any history buff perhaps more than he was expecting.<br />NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH!  Some nudity/sexuality and much worse in terms of violence and gore than 'B.o.B' !!!!!<br /><br />After watching Pacific, I was compelled to return BoB to my DVD player for a comparison.  BoB, in my conclusion, is a far more entertaining narrative and gives more artistic liberties than Pac, which is more documentary-style and flows closer to real-life than BoB.  Character development was a little shallow in Pac. as there are simply too many characters to follow to get to know them very well.  However, any fan of war documentaries will find the day-to-day of these Pacific marines well-researched and fascinating!  A must see!!!!
B0034JYC7G|5.0|I can listen music, talk and have conference with this accessory. It's very comfortable, light and with big quality sound
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game had great graphics as all other G5 games. Yes it took awhile to download but worth it. It took my son and I just under 4 hours to solve it and probably only because he rocks at these games! The only disappointment we had is there were much more HO than in previous games. We enjoy more of the strategy part. This played well on my kindle fire.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|This is a awesome CD this guy can so sing. His voice is like no other. and he is a good Christian Boy.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this app is awesome. although the object of the game is kind of creepy/weird it is amazingly fun and challenging to all.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a great game and I do love it. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Love, love, love this CD. Tony Bennett is such a classic artist and this is one great collection of songs.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An absolutely astounding read! I recommend this book to anyone who, like my self, is fascinated with near death experiences, and more importantly, the search for spiritual truth. Very well written, suspensful in parts, and written with a purpose of Love. Do yourself a favor and read this book. I  couldn't put this book down and literally read it in a day, it's that good!
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|. Ok movie not worth $3.99 to rent though. Jennifer Lawrence can do better than this. She has in Winter's Bone and Hunger Games.
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|Great movie. Really captured the decade well. Riveting. Kept me engaged the entire time. It brought me through a gamut of emotions.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I downloaded this game for my Grand son while we were on vacation. He enjoyed this game as much as the vacation
0385341008|5.0|This is a delightful book.  One of the top ten I've read...\\"Where'd You Go, Bernadette\\" is at the top of that list now....<br />I'm recommending it for our high school student's summer read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy to read, not particularly deep but didn't need to be.  I wish the author would have told about more combat missions, but that would have made the raid on UBL more anti-climatic.<br /><br />Overall, would recommend to anyone!
B00933JL0A|4.0|Downloaded this game after getting fed up with Airport City. This is way better. There is no requirement to make in game purchases, or unrealistic goals. This game is fun. Lots of different scenarios and challenges to enjoy. There is also a sandbox mode that lets you build a city from scratch in various locals (swamps, forest, etc).<br /><br />Couple minor things with the game play bother me (and very minor). I can't tell how much food my villagers eat. This makes it difficult to plan need for bakeries/fisheries/etc. You just kind of have to build and hope you make enough food. Also, it is kind of unclear how some of the buildings work exactly (carpenter, warehouse, tax). An option on the main menu to view details of each building and how they work would be nice.<br /><br />Could not put this down for the first week or two. I still play it regularly when I have some time to spare.<br /><br />Pros<br />  * No need for in game purchase<br />  * Many modes/challenges to enjoy<br />  * Good graphics and game play<br /><br />Cons<br />  * Screen slightly cut off (Kindle fire)<br />  * Need for food difficult to judge before hand
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is really a great game. Lots of excitement, new monsters, and more twists and turns. Still trying to get through more levels but is loads of fun (and frustrating!!)  Highly recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thanks Amazon! I would not be able to watch the Walking Dead if you did not stream it on Amazon!  It streams well and since I do  not have HD on my computer-Amazon has the option to pay less for the regular episode instead of buying the more expensive HD version.!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game but it could improve.  That is why I am giving this have four stars. I love horses.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my 10 year old cousin! She is obsessed with these books and she was so excited to get it! She knew I was getting it for he before hand but that was only because I did not know which ones she had not yet read! She needs two other ones so I might get her those too at some point! but she was happy with it!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This so an amazing app for Star Wars fans! I love the Chewbacca bird and the &quot;pigtroopers.&quot; This is definitely worth 99 cents! I hope you approve of my review!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I love this book and it  is awesome and really really really good. It is very very very funny. READ IT!!!
B009AMAM9S|5.0|This film was not only a truly breathtaking display of cinematography, but also an inspirational and all around phenomenal movie. I have never been so taken aback by any other film as much as I was when I finished this one. It is a beautiful portrayal of past, present, and future societies with an amazing correlation between each different society and context.<br /><br />It is definitely worth seeing, buying, and rewatching.<br /><br />I would also advise buying the book, as it will provide more detail into the movie.<br /><br />However, the movie is amazing stand-alone, as well.
1250010403|5.0|I like that the book was less for being used, however it was &#34;gently&#34; used. It is still in great shape.
1449415881|5.0|Some of these are just too close to the reality at work, but we do not (yet) have a real &#34;Pointy Hair Boss&#34;.  I cannot go a year without these calendars and this one keeps up the tradition.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies. I love Mark Wahlberg as an actor and he does an amazing job in this movie. I can watch this movie over and over...and not get sick of it.
B000L53D4O|5.0|I'm told the recipient really likes this toy, pushing it around even though he cannot walk yet.  I think that means it's a goodie !
B006LSZECO|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version and enjoyed this book tremendously on my vacation. There are surprising twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat wondering which characters to be loyal to.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|This book was so interesting and I really liked it.  I read the whole first book. By:Nick hansell age eight
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|As a movie it is actually better than 3 stars, as a Bond film a more gritty type but not to my liking generally... and thank heaven we are now done with the personal history of Bond. I actually liked the deeper psychic interest in the man... he became more than a cartoon character... but... .<br /><br />There is a silly Joy in the Character... an irreverent humor in the face death... and a sexy something... that was not often there in this film... so much personal history submerged every other aspect of a Bond film that is light hearted, sexy and other worldly cool.<br /><br />That said I would not drop the depth of character but rather bring back some of the gadgets... cleaver one liners, babes and romance and happy confidence... .<br /><br />The first movie with this Bond with the repartee between Bond and what became his love interest on the train was extremely well written and that kind of new Bond I approve of.<br /><br />It is hard to write a Bond film since 911/7/7 because of their core lie that many in the audience are aware of that makes all political pretenses of glory and patriotism sour.<br /><br />I would love to see another Goldfinger remake. Gold is now such an important controversy in the face of abject theft in all markets and the currency wars... that it is a natural theme.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I like everyone lese really liked the song &#34;Some Nights&#34; so I bought the album.  After listening to the whole album, I began to like the other songs a lot more, and now love the whole album.  A brilliant piece of work.
0316224588|4.0|Like Harry Bosch working cold cases in Los Angeles [[ASIN:1619690047 The Drop]], John Rebus has retired but is back working cold cases in the Lothian and Borders office based in Edinburgh, Scotland.  A woman is trying to reopen the case of her missing daughter, and has tracked down information on other young women who have gone missing - all along the same stretch of highway.  The cases stretch over a number of years, and had all been explained away.  Now the latest missing teenager has connections - her mother's boyfriend is a known gangster, and Rebus finds himself reconnecting to the criminal gangs he has encountered in the past.  Gangsters have there own way of dealing with people who hurt their families.<br /><br />The plot goes a bit slow as you are taken on a tour of the Scotish Highlands, but the case gradually develops.  In addition to looking for evidence of the missing women, Rebus has to contend with his old nemesis Fox in the complaints office who wants to make an issue of his contacts with known gangsters.  The investigation eventually leads to a gruesome discovery, and also to a surprise for the woman who initiated the inquiry.  When you turn over rocks, you may find the unexpected.<br /><br />Rebus has his own ways of dealing out justice when there is not enough evidence for an arrest and conviction.  He does tend to use other people, sometimes to their detriment.  Events take an unexpected turn in the climax.<br /><br />The retirement age for police has been raised, and Rebus has applied for reinstatement.  You may see more of him in the future, and a new gangster has appeared and is making a fast rise in the ranks.
B009JZORSI|2.0|I liked the story premise -- the Enterprise has to go back in time in order to obtain the necessary information/tools to resolve a crisis in future. But the execution is poor.  Spend your time and money on one of the better ST films.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A typical Tom Clancy style of intrigue and international conflict.  Predictible at many parts of the story with a big ending.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Love Angelina action pack thrillers. Great Star gives her all, as a fan very appreciative,  Worth the money spend and never a waste of time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, John Grisham's writing is outstanding.  I've read a number of his books and enjoyed them all equally.  I definately will read more of this author's works.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I caved in and watched an episode to see what the fuss was about. Then I thought, &#34;well I may as well watch episode two to see if it's as good as it seems or if it was just a good pilot.&#34; The rest is history. My husband and I watched it as often as we could until we ran out of episodes. My husband can always predict plot lines, and he says this show isn't predictable or formulaic. It's probably important to note that he's typically not a fan of this genre (he's into sci-fi), and I like sitcoms like The Office, Parks and Rec, and (the late) Private Practice. But we're both hooked.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book is as good as the first two books.  Although my favorite is still the first book &#34;Dragon Tattoo&#34;.  I am so let down that there isn't a book 4.  Would love to read more.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This isn't the perfect application for what I want (mainly note taking in classes), but it is fantastic that I can download the app for my laptop and have the files automatically there. I also just downloaded the app for my Android phone and I can then go back over what I've written in multiple places.<br /><br />I'm generally impressed with the app and I'm glad I found it.<br /><br />Now if only they could figure out a way to allow me to bold or italicize things with the normal keyboard shortcut from my bluetooth keyboard, I'd be totally set.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It was very spell binding.  It kept me reading from chapter to chapter.  I couldn't put it down.  I was anticipating the next book.
B0073O8BOS|4.0|I really love BOS. Saw them live recently and they were awesome. This album is good - not as good as the first. I have my favorite songs and listen to them all the time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a brilliant app for kindle fire hd. It tells me exactly how much time I have on each different aspects t of the device i.e. music, video, camcorder it's just great and it was free too. I keep checking daily fir the free app and most of them have been great.well done Amazon :))
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife has been asking me to see this Masterpiece Production for quite some time. I finally gave in a week ago and I have to say I'm hooked! Great storyline, superb acting and top notch directing. You won't be disappointed, I promise.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app has to be my favorite app. I usually don't review apps but this one works really really well. I love it that I can carry all my notes and list around on my phone, I no longer have to have a pocket full of paper or search for paper to write notes down
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I LIKE THE LARGE NUMBERS AND BRIGHTNESS OF THE CALCULATOR. I HAD TO KEEP ON BUYING CALCULATORS THEY ALWAYS NEEDED A BATTERY OR IT JUST STOP WORKIING. BUT WITH THE CALULATOR PLUS I DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM AND I ALWAYS HAD TO FIND IT IT KEPT GETTING LOST NOT ANYMORE I AWAYS NO WHERE ITS AT.
1423101499|5.0|i gave this as a gift to my niece, i gave her the other books in the series, she loves it, i think she read the first 3books in a week, i thought she would like to finish the series and of coarse she happy i did give her the rest of the series
B0075LTOR2|5.0|This is a really pleasing box set. I bought it after waiting literally decades to refurbish my Roxy Music collection, consisting primarily of the original issue British Island LPs, the first E.G. CDs and the E.G. Reprise US issues, the latter essentially a slightly louder version of the original E.G. CDs. I skipped the Bob Ludwig remasters altogether, perhaps unfairly, but primarily because I find most remasters of CDs made in the past two decades overly loud and lacking in dynamic range. Thankfully, the trend towards loudness at the expense of dynamics seems to reversing now. That's certainly what I hear in the versions contained in this box set. As far as any CD can, these sound remarkably close to my original LPs. They lack that intangible analog presence but only marginally, and, of course, are free of the pops and scratches accumulated over four decades. They are definitely superior to my old CDs, fuller bass and drums, better defined midrange, less glaring mid-treble.<br /><br />As for packaging, the CDs are enclosed in replica LP gatefold covers, even those that were never issued as gatefolds. The print quality does not match the LPs, but it's good enough, and they are sturdily manufactured. The extras are fun, although multiple mixes and versions of the same song are probably only going to get one or two plays. It is good to have the b sides. I was pleased (although it's not really an issue given you can easily program whatever songs you want to hear on a CD player or computer) to see the \\"Roxy Music\\" CD reverted to the original British LP song listing, omitting \\"Virginia Plain\\", the inclusion of which on later versions of the LP and CD I never liked as it disrupted the flow of the record. That song has been bumped to the 'extras' CD.<br /><br />I don't miss extra liner notes or a booklet at all. Very happy with this reissue.
1423101502|5.0|i gave this as a gift to my niece, i gave her the other books in the series, she loves it, i think she read the first 3books in a week, i thought she would like to finish the series and of coarse she happy i did give her the rest of the series
0880796863|5.0|Its so wonderful to have cards that are very unique and almost exactly the way they were n the early 1900s
0670026603|5.0|This is the best novel I've read in years. These characters will stay with the reader long after the book is finished. This one is hard to put down, I just had to know how it ended.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game is ok. The ads are a pain because you have to go all the way to the home screen to play the game. After re-entering the game, that is.....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Any book that can make me laugh and cry has done it's job. Well done John Green! I will be checking out your other books.
B007M45PMU|4.0|I like the music, it is fun and new. I do admit I did like all the songs on the album.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book a lot, but found it somewhat convoluted and long.  It took me a long time to figure out what was really happening.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This game is a lot of fun, but I have two complaints about it.  First, in some of the layouts the tile designs are a bit small.  Second, and more problematic, every once in awhile it freezes up (on my Kindle Fire) and I have to exit the game to be able to play anymore. This requires that I start a new game.  Annoying, but the game is still fun when it works.
B004V73FGE|4.0|I was a bit skeptical of the remake but there was lots of action, and the story wasn't bad... overall a good watch!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a lot of fun! Some of the levels are really easy, and some are pretty hard, so I can play it when I don't want to think too hard as well as when I really want a challenge.  Bright colors, easy operation, and as far as I can tell, no technical glitches (I play on a Kindle Fire).
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Great conclusion to a series I didn't discover until it had already been off the air for several years (great job, marketing department).
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Simply one of the best damn action movies i have seen in quite a long time. Kind of reminded of me of a John Carpenter style movie like Assault on Precinct 13. Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|That's really all that needs to be said. Except that it's a tragedy that it didn't last longer than a season. Sigh.
B009ERK35W|5.0|I have watched this movie several times over throughout the years. I enjoy it more every time i see it. Nice blu ray transfer too.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have to force close this app everytime I attempt to upload photos. I uninstalled it. Other than that it was alright. I upload a lot of pictures so this app is not useful to me.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|My husband calls me a \\"prude\\"; I guess I am.<br />I was completely taken aback when the first five minutes of this film<br />contained nudity; full frontal nudity. I thought they could only do that in<br />an x-rated film?  Anyway, I was shocked. I would not have rented this movie<br />had I known about it ahead of time.
B008P3I4VG|5.0|It's hard to beat getting two classics in one slim volume. I got quick, pleasant service--I would use this vendor again.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Produto muito bom, chegou no tempo previsto e eu fiquei muito satisfeito com o site e logo estarei fazendo novas compras. Obrigado!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well I'm going to let you know the truth about temple run ,trust me its true...... Temple run 2 is awesome and so fun to play . When you play temple run 2 you feel so entertain so those are the reasons I like to play the awesome and only Temple run 2
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great service, arrived sooner then excepted. A++
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Typically not a fan of English TV but between this and Sherlock, WOW!<br />Give it a go, it is well worth the time spent.
0061733199|5.0|This book does a great job explaining the many different topics it has.  This is a great book to take with you camping or have in your car for the 'in case'.  If zombies attack and we are forced to live in the wilderness I would be glad to have this book.  This is the book with the color pics of the plants and poisonous/dangerous reptiles and sea creatures. The diagrams are easy to follow and it seems to be pretty complete.  My husband even enjoys reading it.  Now that I look at the picture and look at the book beside me the yellow text is actually hunter orange on my book.  Don't know if that will sway anyone to decline a purchase but just thought I would mention it.  With the orange lettering, it makes it easier to find so if I had to find this book and run from zombies, the brighter the better.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Excellent unit.  Although I would have been lost without another Amazon review that said one has to put music files in an MP3/ directory, but I followed that advice and had great music for my road trip.  The FM sound was so good that I forgot to try out the AUX cable.  The vehicle was a Hyundai Sante Fe, and I set the frequency to 88.5.  No interference was noticed, and at 1 point I pulled the Soundfly out from the lighter plug and there was a weak FM station playing.  The Soundfly had no problem overriding the station's signal.
B005HED11Y|5.0|If you want to talk about fine acting, philosophical questions unaddressed considering the times, and relationships, Star Trek was undoubtedly ahead of its time.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|A very captivating story from start to finish, very well acted through-out by a very talented cast. It also deals with moral issues regarding addictions and taking responsibility for your actions. Overall I found it very interesting and it certainly kept my attention from start to finish.
B004OZZ624|4.0|I gotta admit - I never heard of this movie.  I happen to like Russel Crowe - and saw the 4 star ratings by fellow Amazon viewers and gave it a chance - was I suprised.  I really enjoyed this movie - well written and acted.  Very good story line and kept you guessing throughout. Some good plot twists - easy film to recommend!
B009HELT3C|5.0|Generally speaking sequels get worse with each movie, like riding off the success of the first movie. Not this time. Totally enjoyed each and every MIB movie!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved it I want more w<br />Recommend this g a me.<br />Kept me very interested in it.can't wait to try a sequel
B0043VDIAG|3.0|While I usually enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, I found this one lacking. The writing was basic, almost out of 'how to write a novel in a week'. The story line was good, but unfortunately was disappointed as it felt like it had been written in a rush.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I was really excited when I saw this app and quickly installed it.  I find it challenging to figure out how to work with the app.  I'm new to all the technology things.  I wish it were a bit more user friendly.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Just received this cover today and I love it! It looks just like a leather bound book. The embossing and decal don't look cheesy at all.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Although a DC-9 (or MD-80) cannot fly inverted, the story line (a drunk and drugged pilot) probably wasn't too far off the mark.  I enjoyed the movie, but found it sad how his life turned out.  Why his wife didn't blow the whistle on him earlier (to the airline) I questioned.
1878424319|5.0|Really changed my life! I have it in print and in audio book, I have listened to it and and read it several times!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I've loved all 3 Christopher Nolan Batman movies.  The Dark Knight Rises is no different.<br /><br />As the final chapter in a 3 act movement, this movie was bound to be a bit of a let down after the The Dark Knight.  It would probably be impossible to top Heath Ledger as Joker and the intensity of that movie.  For that matter, I don't think that Nolan tried.  I think he just went about his work.  In that way, the choice of Bane was the villain is fantastic.  If you watch this movie and aren't creeped out by Bane, I am not sure what's wrong with you.<br /><br />Bane is an unbelievable villain.  He embodies evil and yet Nolan finds way to humanize him and also to show how psychotic he really is.<br /><br />As for the story of the Selina Kyle, Anne Hathaway does a nice job of filling a role that is a tough one in the Nolan universe just because Kyle is a much stronger character than any other woman has been in this trilogy.  Does she fit what the traditional comic book fan would say is Catwoman?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  In the context of the Nolan Batman universe, she is a good fit and she adds a bit of continuity to the story between Batman and Bane.<br /><br />The big question of any series is whether or not the main character evolves over the course of the story.  In the case of Bruce Wayne/Batman, he would have to or he would be dead.  I guess the big question for anyone watching the movie is did Wayne change enough?  Did Wayne find peace?<br /><br />In total, I was probably predetermined to like this Batman movie.  Is it perfect?  No.  Is it a good ending for the series?  Yes.  Should you watch it?  Absolutely.
0385528752|5.0|Easy read, with understandable concepts that can be applied as you're reading the book. Starting to apply it to my personal life as well as professional. Highly recommend if you are looking for another perspective on how to change anything in your life.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent acting and gripping story line. Both my husband and I watch several episodes at one sitting.  That's the nice thing about having an entire season on DVDs. To the very few who havent seen Downton Abbey - what are you waiting for?
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Netflix doesn't have this show available which makes it nice that I can watch it on here. I'm into shows like this and Bones. This is a show worth watching....enjoy
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Love Romola Garai's performance. Prefer this version than previous ones and look forward to seeing more British period drama remakes!
B00ANGICRE|5.0|This it was a touching film that made you really think about the things that you take for granted when he cannot live with a disability on daily basis. While the topic of this movie is deep, the makers of the movie put this together with respect and care and the actors did a wonderful job at bringing forth something that needed to be shared. I looked into the story a little further after watching the movie and so it seems that Hollywood did make it a bit more grandiose for the viewers themselves, I still enjoyed the message that it was sharing in the overall movie itself. Both Hunt and Hawkes did an amazing job with their characters and I have to say that I would highly recommend this movie to any and all.<br /><br />* received a copy of this movie for an honest review, though it did not affect my overall thoughts that were reflected above*
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. The characters were like able and the stories were all well thought out. I only wish that the show could have made a season 5, but then I guess there'd be no Mr. Bates in Downton Abbey!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This Marware case very easy to put on, the color is compatible with my Kindle and gives lots of protection.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Must be me, but was totally unable to get into this book. I have left it on my Kindle and wikk try again.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have no regrets on this purchase. It was a great deal, and this series is fantastic. It's too bad that Heath Ledger died, I think they might have done more.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|It works great for cutting my wine bottles - I have made candle holders out of them, vases, pencil/paint brush holders, etc. The possibilities are endless! And this product works way better than a method I had seen on the internet of tying string around a bottle and burning it - that didn't work for me at all but this did. Once the you score the bottle with this product, just pour boiling water over the score line then put under cold running water - you may have to do this twice (hot then cold, hot then cold) but a lot of the time the top of the bottle fell off on the first try!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Not what I expected at all.  After his previous tongue-in-cheek &#34;Zombie Survival Guide&#34; I was ready for a little silliness.  Not this time.<br /><br />It's a parallel to Terkel's &#34;The Good War&#34; in terms of oral history and the formula works very well.  We get vignettes, some nearly of short-story length, told in numerous voices that lend an eerie reality to the narrative.  Brooks treats the plague scenario seriously this time, and within it has drawn some marvelous miniature portraits of characters you won't soon forget.<br /><br />And so my own homage to one of the scariest lines in recent literature: &#34;By Christmas there was plenty of food.&#34;  Beautifully done.  Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I'm going to be a awesomely fan of this game called subway surfer I love it I play it almost all the time in a day after the great thing about it and I want to play all the time over and over again for the great thing about it
0425264351|5.0|I had never heard of the author or the series and I like everyone else saw that they were making a movie and was thinking, hmmmm lets check it out, its probably nothing.  After I read the first chapter, I was sold.  From there the book became more interesting and the mild character development was good as well.  Some authors tend to give us too much information about characters that don't matter, but the leads in this book, were on point.  I was thoroughly entertained by Killing Floor and am looking forward to reading the rest of the collection.  Thanks Lee Child!
B009SRFQWI|1.0|Japanese?  Really?  I guess I didn't read the &#34;fine print&#34;  I have wanting to see this movie forever and because its in Japanese, I haven't even opened it!  I'm quite disappointed!
B004SBQGHS|3.0|my grandkids love to play with this game. It is challenging and makes them calculate the aim. They like the sling shot.
B006PTNQGU|4.0|We love this movie and so do our kids - we have fun finding movies on Prime that we grew up watching as well.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|King B has got amazing albums before with exceptional sales but so far, nothing can change the fact that, 4 is the QUEENs most mature and vocally powerful album to date.  Haters r tryna tarnish her image by calling her a lip-syncher but its just hate. They all know Bey has got very powerful pipes, so has jennifer hudson, tamar braxton...so keep doing ur thing Bey.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because instead of reading you can just listen to it, I play this for the whole family to listen to
B009VYF5E2|4.0|I always find the Merlin episodes enjoyable, a little humor, action and almost always good plots and acting. I'm sorry to hear<br />that season 5 will be the last.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Hot all the way threw... Blown away by how good of a performer macklemore is... A must have! From start  to end amazing!!
B002SV36XM|1.0|I downloaded the KIndle app on my I-pad. Mistake. Some of the text is so small, I can't read it. I can't &#34;zoom&#34; nor do I know what page or line I'm reading. This is a complete waste.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Sort of like twilight with wolves - but a lot of interesting details about the werewolves that gave this tale a new twist. The scenery was very vivid as well - really took the reader into the cold with the characters.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a book I had to read rather than using the audible version.  The writing is profound, maybe too much profoundness, or too frequent.  A truly eloquent, moving story.  My book club loved it, except for one member who thought the &#34;profoundness&#34; was overdone.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I am an avid reader and if I never read another book, I am satisfied. I am in love with the way this book is written and I feel years of glorious learning ahead from only what I have read here.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love Lindsey Stirling's music, and enjoy listening to it when I'm working at the computer. She has music videos for her songs on YouTube that are good to watch as well.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Everything about this movie is great from the storyline, the actors, the costuming and the soundtrack is beautiful. I'd suggest this to anybody.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Love Maggie Smith's sarcasm as Cousin Violet.  She's a hoot.  Storyline keeps you watching. Enjoy watching, but not living, this time gone by.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I can't wait for Season 2 to be available to Prime members.  My husband and I are hooked on this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Shirley McClain joining the cast put a fun American twist to the snobbery that is Downton Abbey.  Family is growing in good ways and disappointing.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|purchased as Christmas gift and brother in law enjoyed it.....so I can't say much about it...I did not watch it.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game, even for us &#34;old folks&#34;. I like to play it to pass the time!
B009GEAPYW|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie, it is by no means no &#34;red hood&#34; but it is cool. The story line could have been developed a little more but it stands ok on it own.
B000083C49|5.0|Arrived early and in good shape. Great movie! I have already wayched it two or three times. One of the classic Star Trek movies.
B006JRIZJG|5.0|This thing is great.  It's storage and a toy combined.  My daughter is starting to become interested in Barbies but this is actually what got her into them even more.  Shipping was great as was the price.  Definitely recommend
B000NY12CI|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's ordeals and her bravery were very moving.  The book is very sobering and sad when one realizes the literally millions of women who live under horibble repression and domination and all in the name of religiion.  Unlike her they do not have the means or the courage to rebel.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book in a day because once I started it I couldn't stop! I look forward to the next!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|How can anyone say anything bad about Star Wars!  It is an amazing Epic Adventure through the stars and beyond.
B0096A9QXC|3.0|This game is very fun, just as the other reviews clearly state, but I give it only 3 stars because it will, randomly, close its self out! This is especially frustrating when you are in the middle of a game, trying for an achievement, then all of a sudden you get the boot. There went all of your hard work :(  Because this happens frequently it gets only 3 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses are and games like this so this will be an good free for those horse lover's out there.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|I purchased this for my son! He loved it and it didn't look like it was repackaged! Great movies as well!
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Great effort, lacked real possibility... Too complicated to watch and understand. Found this story line hard to follow on every level.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not a big reader but I really enjoyed this series. Not sure but this may have been my favorite one.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|This movie was adorable to watch. Loved the animation and the story line. Would recommend to an audience of kids under 12 years of age.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this after seeing the movie....now I love the movie even more, for how true they stayed to the book. Great read, hard to put down!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|I love this kind of movie that can transport the viewer to a place of idealism and in this case, limitless possibilities.  Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job of portraying his role and the writing and storyline in the film provide a great escape for the viewer.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that I enjoy escaping into time and time again.  If only such a thing existed.  Some interesting twists to the film.<br /><br />Enjoyable ....
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It does everything it says it does. Nice alarm. Wasn't late to work toady. Almost made me jump out of bed. Good clock.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|What ever you do if you have a kindle fire don't get this app you can play it the first few times and get to never get to play it again. you suck temple run 2!!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Awesome game! You can play with your friends. but but you can only have one game at a time against one person..
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Easily one of John Hughes finest films on seizing the day! The contrast between the characters and their interplay makes for an extremely entertaining movie.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this story, but what can I say?!  I'm a sucker for good girls falling for the bad boys....can't wait for the 2nd book to come out!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|never again, yes, it's zep; best if with a good sound system  always unbelievable. never duplicated, sometimes copied but copies are knock-offs....this is at least
B000NQRR1Q|5.0|With interests in both the occult and rare books, this movie hit all my hot buttons. The story has already been described, so I won't repeat that again here, but the acting and characters are tremendously enjoyable and rich. Johnny Depp is his usual terrific self, supported wonderfully by Frank Langella, Lina Olin and Emmanuel Seigner. All characters are deliciously devious! I loved the interplay between Depp and Seigner as we try to figure out exactly who she is how she fits in. Langella plays a terrifically cold, removed, self-impressed, wealthy intellect who also happens to own the world's most valuable book collect on the topic of the Devil himself. And thus the story evolves. It's well worth the few dollars to own a copy of another interesting Roman Polanski movie.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I own many concert videos on DVD and Blu Ray. This one is definitly ranked in the top 5 for performance, audio fidelity, and strage settings! Absolutely one of the best concert videos out there!
1439127700|5.0|This book provides a clearly written expose of the inner thoughts and covert actions of our presidents, especially after they left office.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|I got this for my son for his birthday, and it was a big hit. For the money, it's a great set, and both the Batwing and helicopter we're fun to put together and play with. Another hit from Lego!
B000FBJAOG|3.0|An interesting work of &#34;fiction&#34;.  Very verbose.  But is very very interesting.  A bit pricy for what it is.  Does have some interesting &#34;tips on zombies&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app and it is so easy learn.  One thing about the game is that when you get the booster.  There is nothing up there to run in to.  I think that there should have been a pigeon in New York.  Or a parrot in Rio.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|For anyone who is a fan of \\"period pieces,\\" this series is a must-see! Not only is the scenery/sets and costumes/makeup incredible, but the stories of both the staff and the noble family are wonderfully enticing and touching. I cry during almost every single episode. Awesome series!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|ok my brother has this game on his samsung tablet and its soooooo fun!!!!! i recomend this game! you'll really enjoy this game
B0058Z4NR8|2.0|I really think that Acemoglu is a great economist and academic too. However, this book is a poor reduction of historic phenomena and institutions. I understand that this is a simple exposition to non-academic audience but they reached just the opposite goal. I loved Acemoglu's papers in QJE but this is too much.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|So of course I'm a big Final Fantasy fan. Addiction is probably a better way to describe it. I used to own this for the DS but now having it on my kindle is so much better. I can touch options in battle instead of pressing the wrong skill. I can carry it anywhere and play it after reading a book or playing a different game. I adore this edition ever so much.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This story was for the most part intresting and engaging.  I always read before I go to sleep and did look forward every night to continue the store.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because sometimes it was slow and somewhat predictable, although it still moved along. Almost all the way through the book its mentioned what terrible childhoods they both had. Thats touched on briefly but I felt not elaborated enough on, as to why these two damaged people were so drawn to each other. Over all though, I did enjoy the book and the story.  It was a pleasant distraction for unwinding at the end of the day.  I would recommend it as a sort of soap opera type story, if that is something you like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is an awesome game. It is really fun and you can challenge yourself too. I really recommend getting this game
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Another great movie in the Toy Story series.  We watched it for our Family Movie Night.  The movie is enjoyable for just about all ages.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|excellant program for removing Red Eye and special effects , one of the better photo programs i used, I recommend it
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It stops working after a while.And if you don't touch the screen hard enough you will die.And the app freezes sometimes
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|Came in two days. Great movie if you want something different from the normal Hollywood love story. Would recommend to anyone who has had a hard break up.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|When I read that book was written in the form of a log, I was uncertain if I would like it.  I am glad I took the chance.  Well written, great character and I felt I was trapped on Mars along with the main character.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you are looking for a heart warming show this is the one. The characters will make you laugh and cry.You will be sad that the show must come to an end. The best TV you will ever watch. I liked it so much i purchased the set. I highly recommend this show. If i could, i'd give it 10 stars.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a classic.  I love to play it.  I do miss the joy stick and buttons from the controller though. Have fun playing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I almost beat all my friends. Great but sometimes freezes while I'm playing. I don't know if that's what its suppose to do.
B00821OX98|5.0|I give it 5/5 for creativity and some originality! Never can predict whats going to happen next, and its not as predictable as say BSG or Heroes
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game like it I would rather in the beginning you get to pick your first horse but whatever its still fun and get to change his name if you want lol
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I started reading it and could not put it down. I loved the ending.  Did not see it coming. Thank you for writing this book
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|No one like Columbo. He is the ultimate detective. Easy going, takes you around the block to show you the building across the street and then lays it on you. Guilty and no way out so that you have no choice but to say; take me away. Netflix doesn't have all of the episodes and Amazon prime only has the first season. And besides, I was always lamenting that they don't show this on television anymore in New York. But now I own it, I watch it when I want. And the episode I want. And now I see all that I was missing. If you know Columbo, buy it. If you like Columbo, buy it. If you don't know Columbo, try it If you try Columbo, you will be hooked. Trust me.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I loved this book, then again I love all of Dan Brown's books.  His books have alot of true facts in them which make them a really good read.  For those people who love thrillers with facts, I would recommend this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You can actually watch season three before it airs on TV as well. This is a great show. I was totally hooked after the first episode.
B003SI3URQ|5.0|A great amazing movie. My 13 year old son loved this!! All about mythology and he felt it was very accurate
B000000WA4|5.0|GREAT ALBUMS I COULD NEVER GET TIRED OF THE SMASHING PUMPKINS NEVER EVER! REMINDS ME OF BEING IN HIGHT SCHOOL! :)
B002RSDW80|5.0|I love this movie. I grew up watching Julia Child and learning how to cook from her shows.It was a bit of nostalgia for me.I still have her cookbooks
B005HED1BE|5.0|I never really watched Trek until I watched the JJ Abrams reboot. I enjoyed that movie so much, and have had so many friends telling me I would love Trek for so long, that I decided to dive in. This series is excellent. It looks great, sounds great, and really has been a joy to watch.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have apparently been behind the times.  I did not know Jack Ryan was Potus and had a son. A grown son.  It was interesting to follow Jack junior around the globe and thwart the mean rebel Chinese from taking over the world economy.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love, love, love this radio app! i listen to it everyday and I listen to a whole bunch of different music on it and learn about new music also because this radio app has a bunch of different genres and a lot of different stations in each genre. Really recommend it!
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This is a great album with songs from my generation.  The CD works just fine with no scratches or defects.  For the price this is a very good purchase.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love it. It is perfect. You do not need anything else. What stinks is my school banned e-readers so not as helpful anymore. Still helps with homework. Great app because it is free. Do not buy the $50 one this is all you need.
B000GWE44U|5.0|A must see and have movie!  Highly recomment watching this movie and keep in your collection.  buy buy buy !
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Enjoyed absolutely every minute of this movie. This totally makes up for Quantum  of  Solace, which was such a disappointment.  I like the fact that the writers identified James is aging, but he is still golden. The relationship between James and M is really tested, and shows their respect and admiration for one another.  The locations shots are beautiful. The night scene in shanghai was gorgeous.<br /><br />I love Javier Barden as the villain. I believe he is the best one yet. He was funny, eccentric, and smart.  I hope they can discover a way to bring him back for future movies.<br /><br />I rented the movie, but I will buy it for my collection.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have read all of Cornwells books and always looked forward to her next.  however,  as her stories began to include more character emotion leading up to the &#34;death&#34; of Benton and the near rape by Marino, etc. I felt there were too many separations of the few important characters.  I am still waiting to find out what happened to Marino at the very end of a more recent book where he stood on the deck of his little beach house and screamed, alone.  i was left wondering if he had committed suicide or what? and very much looked forward to the next book where i was sure this traumatic episode would continue with the answer but to my knowledge it was never mentioned again in any following books.  I was glad Pete returned but what had happened??
0345803485|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars because of its unfailing ability to make me laugh.  However I don't think that's what it was originally aiming to do.  Seriously though.... I've never laughed out loud like I do when reading this.  Oh and -1 star for making me feel insecure about my penis.  K thx bye.
0762777931|5.0|- easy read with lots of applicable information.  very inspiring and motivating.  funny as all get out! laugh out loud
B00683JK9K|5.0|I have never been a person to work on puzzles, but this app is great.  It has places for beginners, and wonderful music to listen to.
B000P0J0AG|3.0|Heat was a good movie. DeNiro is a good actor. I enjoyed it and would recommend it again to others.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|Simple calculator at your  finger tips.  the board is big and you have no problem in finding the keys.<br />Nice.
B0001XAOL6|5.0|I thought this movie was great and pretty darn near accurate. Will Smith was great. Melvin Van Peebles was also great, and Ron Silver (Angelo Dundee) was superb! jamie Fox was good. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to others.
