1564029654|5.0|I encountered the paperback version in my local bookstore during my lunch hour. My son was not even 1 years old yet, but he cried terribly every morning when I left for work and waited desperately for me when the sun sets and I'm not home yet. It was a time when I was working until 10p.m. to get a project done by a specific due date and he'd refuse to go to bed until Mommy got home. When I read the book, it appealed so much considering what was going on at the time, that even though I thought my baby was a little too young, I bought it anyway.<br /><br />The paperback is beautiful and large, each individual page truly like artwork that you could frame on the wall! It was a hit with my son from the first day. However, my husband only read it to him when Mommy is not around once. He started crying at \\"And she came!\\" because HIS Mommy hadn't come. Before this happened, we weren't sure whether he understood the story!<br /><br />My son loved the book so much, he often took it and insisted on turning the pages himself. By the time my baby boy turned one, the paperback was looking quite worn. He'd torn the pages a bit, here and there, and we were sad to see the beautiful artwork marred by tape, but that's what books are for, right? To be loved and used.<br /><br />When he finally pulled the cover off the book, we decided it was time to buy a new copy. When I saw that amazon.com had a boardbook version, I immediately ordered that one, as that would last longer than the paperback with my physically over-affectionate 1.5 year old. The boardbook serves its purpose for my toddler to flip through, but I think I will be buying another paperback version when he gets a little older, because the boardbook is short by 10 pages, dropping many pieces of beautiful illustrations, although the words and the story is fully intact. It is also smaller in size, so some of the detail is lost to the eye.<br /><br />Now that my son is 2 years old, he has taken to flapping his arms and bouncing up and down with the baby owls when Owl Mother has arrived. I have no doubts that this book will engage my baby boy for a few years more.up and down with the baby owls when Owl Mother has arrived. I have no doubts that this book will engage my baby boy for a few years more.
B008469DGY|5.0|So yea this was great free &amp; would be worth 99&cent; or more Imo.  Graphics, gameplay, sound, skill &amp; fun factor are all 4.5 rating to me.  First app I fully recommend.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great episodes. Great on-going stories. Suspenseful. SMART. Writing is well above average. I like that the main characters are (were) relatively unknown. This is likely to launch a few careers. Excellent TV.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|It is just fun entertainment!  No social message; just fun!  The characters(especially the loony with the museum) are ones you would recognize in any small town.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Well worth the time to read! Great characters and great story. My 14 year old Daughter also loved this book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun, lots of different ways to play and absolutely no bugs, handfuls or other problems ;) Very happy  this game!
B0046B1KHG|4.0|Have it on my Kindle for my niece and nephews to watch while out and about. No more crazy kids. They can sit and watch during long waits and trips.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|John Wayne at his best in what I feel is a comic role.  Maureen matches him to a T as his wife.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|This show is crazy good!  The story line is incredibly diverse, it's not like Law and Order where it's the same plot over and over.  The characters ave very believable and you care about them.  I highly recommend this show.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Poor writing, poor story line, too much repeating.  Why is this a best seller?  Not a good book at all.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I have never seen picture quality this good. Period. If you love this movie then you must see it fully restored.
B005544TRQ|5.0|An unlikely set-up and pair careen through the legal world......somewhat akin to the unlikely duo within the police world of &#34;White Collar.&#34; We love the quirky characters of Mike and Harvey and Jessica as much as we loathe the turdy nemesis of Louis. Very fun watching although hang on to your comprehension skills through the twists and turns of the law and its practice.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you miss the old school Mario Bros games, then Lep's World is for you! Gameplay is similar but with a leprachuan.  Defeat enemies with pinecones, gather coins, avoid pitfalls, find four leaf clovers for life energy. And you end up at the end of the rainbow! This game is so awesome, I can't stop playing it. Only 5 stars because I can't give it 10!
1878424319|5.0|This book is about common sense which most people don't have. Loved the book. Please give to your children and grandchildren.
0525953728|5.0|Fantastic operation told in a simple easy to read manner. For me, this was a real page turner. The storytelling had a good easy flow through the entire book related in a journeyman-like way. Well Done.
B000GWE44U|4.0|Fantastic movie, but the paper insert of the jewel case was slightly warped, which was a bit disappointing. The cover of the disc also has a very low-resolution picture of Danny on his trike, which seemed just lazy. Of course, I'm nitpicking the presentation. The movie is fantastic and I could recommend it to any fan of Kubrick, King (although it's almost not even the same work of fiction as King's original novel), or horror.
0316044695|2.0|Egocentric story of an elite team that plans and tries to execute a flawed battle plan. With so much back history and touting of the SEAL organization the actual operation is doomed to fail with faulty intelligence and hubris.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this all the time. It really helps me to fall asleep and stay asleep. It also works great for my 2 year old son who knows when I turn this on it's naptime.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|A must for a Dark Knight fan( all ages included). Can imagine a new story and play for hours together

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I know this isn't much, but, this game is the most EPIC game ever. Besides Red Dead Redemption.<br />Just get this game.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|This is probably the best app I have. It's so addicting and is very fun. Buy it. It isn't a waste of money. Great game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great,but I noticed some problems. Like when I used the boost,and accidentaly slammed into something,the guard caught up to me in a heartbeat. How is it possible for a chubby graphical guard catches up to a fit boy on a jetpack THAT fast? Overall it's a great game. (:
B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney has been in some odd films.  This is certainly one of them, but for some reason it found a place in our hearts.  Love the sound track too.
6305428387|5.0|Wonderful family movie since it is a very inspiring story mixed with comedy as well!! Definitely recommend it!! The kids love it too!
1616550414|5.0|High quality book and a MUST HAVE for Zelda fans old and new. The Price is unbeatable and the information is priceless.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|This 10 episode series follows the investigation of a young boys death in a small community. You will recoginize many of the actors. David Tennant shows his talent especially well, almost makes you forget he was Doctor Who, but not quite. My wednesday evenings have been centered around this series. I purchased this episode because I missed it. For a little less that $2 you are entertained for an hour. Well worth it.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|The same crew who did &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; do an action movie. It rocks! And if you are a horror fan you must see &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34; if you haven't already.

0762439009|5.0|I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he really enjoyed it. With each item he took from the kit, he laughed. He took the rug mouse pad and put it in his briefcase right away to take to work for his desk.
B000000WF0|5.0|Other reviewers have rightly praised this album for the quality of the songwriting and recorded performances, so I won't be redundant with that.  Probably the highest compliment I can pay a rock album is when I can say, \\"If I put this record on, it will bring me back to certain time and place in my life - and I can still enjoy it over and over.\\" \\"Urban Hymns\\" does that for me everytime. 1997 was a year of personal change (i.e., I moved to different city, had lots of turmoil in my professional life, was disconnected from family etc.) and this album provided a sonic salve that evened all that out. The lyrics Richard Ashcroft and company wrote are still relevant today. I've owned this on CD since its release in 1997, but I love it so much I'm planning to invest in a new vinyl copy (got back into vinyl recently). If you love rock and roll, you need this album in your collection. Their debut album \\"A Storm in Heaven\\" is also excellent and worth getting, but they really came full circle on \\"Urban Hymns\\". While their latest LP \\"Fourth\\" has its moments, it's nowhere near as good as this one. If you are reading this and still wondering if you should buy it, don't wonder anymore -- just get it!
B008Y72BD0|5.0|This was a very touching story of a girl and all she has gone through in her life. Great story.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch is brilliant. He gives this great spin on Sherlock Holmes that's never really been done before. Forget anything else you've ever seen done before with Sherlock Holmes. This is a million times better.
B00DHNJGCU|3.0|As much as I like Colin Farrell .. and I mean really like him and Terrence Howard.. I just couldn't stay awake to watch it.
B0094M4O3O|5.0|Our whole family--ages 43, 13, and 11--enjoyed this one. Solid, family movie! Based on a true story and has an important life lesson for all.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|My husband loved this movie.. I fell asleep. it was cute and great for maybe teens or preteens. Love John Malevich
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a good app. Finally a clock that can wake me up when I go on long weekends, it's nice not to have to worry about to be on time.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Good movie all around: story, actors, and action. No dull moments. However, I did catch myself rolling my eyes during a car chase scene.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like this weather application at least one weather station  that's nice to look at and its easy too read and understand.
0743201140|1.0|I bought this book under the assumption and price that this was a &#34;new&#34; book. I bought this book for a class & needed to take the test using the code at the end of the book. The code I entered had already been used & the company states you cannot have a new code without buying a new book. No one can guarantee that the code has not been used. SO, be careful!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|So mysterious and logical. No one can guess who is the real killer until they finish the book.This book is awesome and it is a must read book.

1250030951|4.0|*review from books-anovelidea.blogspot.com*<br /><br />I'm fangirling for Fangirl and I'm not even sorry about it!. Cath just speaks my language, she speaks the language of my people. She uses the words that people who aren't in fandoms don't understand, but that's okay because this is a book for people who live that kind of life. This book encompasses the fangirl lifestyle and it makes me all warm and happy inside.<br /><br />Okay, so here's the crazy long list of what I liked. It's quirky and fun and I relate to it on an emotional level. Like, I had serious flashbacks to my freshman year of college. I could scarily relate to Cath and how she wasn't one for frat parties and would rather sit in her dorm on a Friday night and read/write fanfiction. Been there, done that. Though, I did eventually make great friends and made it out of the dorms alive (seriously, what is with dorm life?). This book was also giving me flashbacks to the time when I wrote an entire Harry Potter AU where they were princesses, but let's not talk about that because I was only twelve so it doesn't really count anyway.And speaking of Harry Potter, this came at a perfect time considering the latest J.K. Rowling movie news, especially since Cath herself is obsessed with Simon Snow (basically, it's her universe's Harry Potter). The comparison to HP was perfect, and I think one of the reasons this book is becoming popular is because so many people can relate to that love. There's that saying that goes something along the lines of \\"we're all in the Harry Potter fandom. It's where we all got our start\\". That's what makes this book so successful.<br /><br />I also loved the characters and I truly believe that the world needs more people like Levi in it. He's just so darn happy, it's contagious! I could go on and on about Cath and her Emergency Kanye Parties (something I plan to implement as soon as the next bad day hits), and I think she has something that every reader can relate to. She's passionateabout fanfiction, and seeing that passion is really really cool. I also would like to thank her for my new pep talk that I'll be giving myself when I go out on weekends (\\"I'm the Cool One. Somebody give me some tequila because I'll totally drink it. And there's no way you're going to find me later having a panic attack in your parents' bathroom. Who wants to French-kiss?\\"). Another thing that I liked and I thought was very important was the point that Rainbow Rowell made about fanfiction. Fanfiction isn't something that everyone gets, and yeah, there are some people out there who would consider it plagiarizing (though, personally, I like to use the term borrowing characters/situation). But it's a way of life for a lot of people in the internet community and it doesn't get the respect it deserves. These people are artists, they are writers, just as much as any other person who creates any kind of art. They spend their time plotting and getting those chapters just right and I want to give them a shout-out because they deserve it for all their hard work!<br /><br />As much as I loved this book, there were a couple things I wasn't too in love with. The family drama with Cath and Wren's father was a bit too dramatic for my taste. Yeah, I get it was a big deal, but it took away from the other fluff stuff that I was obsessed with. But I'm being really picky with that. I also didn't like how determined Cath was to not finish her writing project for class. Her teacher was giving her a second chance and she was just blowing it off like it was nothing. It's totally not nothing! When a professor thinks you show potential and wants to help you out, you don't ignore it. This is the real world, and that's how life goes. It seemed unrealistic that she would completely give up her class/a passing grade just because she wanted to write Simon Snow fanfics. I'd love to write fanfic as much as the next person, but I wouldn't risk my education for it. I don't know, maybe that's just my personal opinion. Lastly, I wanted to address a couple criticisms that I heard about the book and what I thought about said criticisms. Two issues: the book was superficial and Cath is too manic pixie dream girl. I disagree with both. Sure, some parts might have been a bit too one-dimensional, but they were so small, it didn't matter to me. Like I said, if you're really into fandoms and that life, you'll be happy with how it's portrayed (basically, it doesn't make us seem like complete losers. A lot of the characters think it's really cool that Cath writes fanfiction and are interested). Also, the manic pixie dream girl is a thing that bothers me a lot. It seems to be the title people give any character that is quirky or different and for some reason, people are making that a bad thing. I think there's a time and place to call a character that, but you can't just call every character a MPDG because then it loses meaning and gets plain annoying.<br /><br />Anyway, I could talk about this book for days, and I probably will to all my friends until they slap me and I finally stop. It's a cool book and it's different from a lot of New Adult/Young Adult books, character-wise and I appreciate it immensely. If you read Fangirl and want to get into a discussion about it, there's an entire book club on Tumblr dedicated to it. Search the tags for \\"reblogbookclub\\" and join the conversation! Here's some more info on that: [...] Now, if you don't mind me, I'm going to go curl up with some tea and read some of my favorite fics!<br /><br />-Annie
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|First of all, I'm glad there is no foolish apple exclusive like pvz2. My kids say it is the best game ever. I don't play much, but the quality of the graphics and design look great. I think it is worth the 99 cents for those who are angry about paying. Also the telepods only work after you have already played a level with the character. You can't use it before then. The list of incompatibility on their site and amazon's own app page are incorrect. Though you can't play with the telepods on the original kindle fire for lack of camera the game itself works fine.  Just my two cents.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I expected a govt cover-up, not human annihilation. I would have liked the stories of his past, the Dr. Brought up to be used in the story line earlier in the book, but I enjoyed it!
B00BWWS81S|4.0|I bought this without any idea of songs/sound because I'm a KT fan. I admit my first  time listening in the car I ended up forgoing it for my new Of Monsters and Men cd. But when I was through with that (and after reading about what she's been through in the past few years) I put KT back in. There may not be any 'Black Horse..\\" or \\"Hold On\\", but there are definitely some gems. My favs are: Made of Glass, Yellow Flower, Waiting on the Heart, Feel it All, Honeydew and No Better Shoulder.
0783240287|5.0|It is a very cleaver verson the play not a 'movie per say.  I am a fan of the story and the musical so I thought it was excellent.<br />Hope you do to.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This gane would be great if it actually worked consistently. How are you supposed to get to the next level if it stalls in the middle of play causing you to run into stuff? I also hate how the camera angle changes randomly. Very irritating, even when the game is running like it's supposed to.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I liked the show. and well its alot more fun to watch without  commercials. and it puts the story into perspective.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm just getting into games on my tablet and this is soo much fun. I've even started taking my tablet to work with me just to play this game during my lunch break.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie...way more than we expected. Great cast, great twists, and interesting premise.  Highly recommend! Worth the rental!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Really liked the book -- look forward to reading the next one.  This is a great book for all romantics to read.
0142421715|5.0|All I can say is that it was worth the wait.  My daughter truly loved this book.  It was delivered exactly when they said it would be.  Will purchase from them again.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|This film came highly recommended, but what a disappointment! Lots of death and mayhem, but no plot. This film wallows in the futuristic slum with dozens and dozens of bad guys (and some not-so-bad guys) being shot and blown up. The \\"hero\\" never acts like a human, his face (what little you see of it) never suggests any emotion. The ending is just a set-up for the sequel, with little resolution. Imagine any current shoot-em-up cop show, take away the human element or heart and you are left with this movie. Don't buy. Don't even rent. You can find better movies elsewhere.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|A very good product. It runs well on my kindle. Friendly interface. Easy to use. I like it so much.<br />Thanks a lot
0786838655|5.0|If you haven't read this book, you are missing out on a great book. Rick Riordan does a great job at discribing events in the story and the characters. The book starts out when Percy Jackson goes to school and everything is normal, until his teacher turns into a monster and attacks him. Percy then knows something is going on. Everyone starts to deny that anything ever happened, but Percy knows deep down they aren't telling the truth. Next Percy and his mother, Sally go on vacation to their lake house. Next thing you know Percy's best friend shows up at the door and has goat legs. Percy is now scared out of his mind. One thing leads to another and Percy wakes up three days after in a strange camp. Grover then informs him that 3 nights before, a minotaur attacked him and killed his mother. Percy learns he is a demigod, a half human half god, Percy also learns that the gods are at war because Zeus's master bolt is missing, and he is the main culprit. Percy, Grover and a friend Percy met at camp named Annabeth, go on a quest to retrieve the Bolt. They have til the summer solstice to retrive it or the gods will go to war. I don't want to spoil anything else, the story gets better and better as it continues. This book is very exiting and there is many other books in this series to read after. I definetly recommend this book to anyone over the age of 9. It is an easy read but also provides countless hours of exitement and adventure. Anyone reading this review should pick up this book and read it, you will not be disapointed.
0061992860|5.0|it is a good idea to have this book pocket sized and thrilled with how much info there is, better than older versions and easy to read still hope I wont have to relie using it.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't imagine anyone not totally loving this series.  The actors are perfectly matched to the actors who portray them.  I wish every episode was four hours long!
B0094K20FK|4.0|Watched this movie again (first time in the 80s) after seeing the new Star Trek Into the Darkness.  I'm a fan of the original Khan and original crew.  Special effects obviously not as good as the new movie but I had a yearning for the old actors.  My teenage son enjoyed the movie too, and he had never seen original series.  Worth renting!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I like the game... Play it everyday .. but these ads are killing me... If the next one has ads I will not play it sorry guys... You do not interrupt a game with an ad ... On the menu and between games is ok .... Bad form
B002ELM5HY|2.0|Was hoping for more upbeat songs, but Mark Knopfler is still great. Maybe his new album will be better. Going to see him in Vegas regardless.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|This is the best movie by this director. The story in the movie reminded me of the book in that as soon as I got into it, the movie wrapped up and left me wanting more.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|He has many slides from long ago and has been using it for over a month now with no trouble at all :)
B001UV4XI8|4.0|Many complain about this movie but I think it is under rated. Important plot information and a get setup. Good buy.
B001BANK32|5.0|This is one of the very few books that really scared me silly.  It is written so well you lose yourself entirely in the book.  It is worth owning so you can read it again and again :)
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was a good book.  It told the story of a secret that a husband had kept from his wife and others over the course of his life.  The book had that Sandra Bullock Movie \\"Crash\\" feel to it.  This was a story of all these seemingly unrelated people and their everyday lives.  I was listening to the book wondering at first how it was related together at all.  It was kind of confusing at first because one chapter would be talking about one set of people, then another chapter, would reveal someone else, and so on.  It would speak about their different situations and all the while I was thinking, \\"What is the secret and how do all these people fit into he equation?\\"  It wasn't until about 1/2 way through the book that the secret was revealed and by that time, I started to see how all of their lives were interconnected.  Oh man, oh man, oh man!  What a secret it was.  After the secret was revealed, I wondered how the couple who held the secret would cope.  Should this secret be exposed to others of just left alone?  How is this couple going to deal with the backlash of keeping such information to themselves?  How do they go on?  Are they going to be able to?  It was interesting to see how the author tied all these people together.  The epilogue was devestating though.  If certain secrets were exposed (because it was more than just one), it would have shaped to outcome of other secrets, and changed the outcome of all of these people's lives.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Haven't used it much but after a quick review it will definitely meet my needs.  I like having all the different versions to choose from.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|My expectations were surpassed as I loved season 2 as much as the first. I can't wait to see the next season.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Matt is vastly different from David but he grows on you with his delightfulness. Amy, however takes longer. Her 21st century woman's ideal of wanting a man but fear of commitment is annoying. She's engaged to Rory but introduces him as her 'friend '.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|This show has a Little bit of everything ,comedy,drama ,interesting premises in science fiction. It makes you think of all possibilities the future has to offer. It doesn't take itself to seriously. if you like time paradoxes,history revision ,and interesting inventions you'll love this show
B00CDXOXB4|2.0|If you've seen the Julia Roberts movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy,\\" feel free to pass on \\"Safe Haven.\\" It's the same story, with a few slight modifications to make it a bit more romantic. Ultimately, however, Julia Roberts is a much better actress than Julianne Hough, and that's where this movie fails.<br /><br />Hough is Katie, a severely abused Boston housewife who flees from her violent alcoholic husband and tries to start a new life in Southport, North Carolina. There she meets a widower shopkeeper, Alex (Josh Duhamel) and gradually learns to love again. But Katie knows her husband will never stop searching for her, and his actions during his manhunt let us know that he'll stop at nothing to get her back.<br /><br />I can't say I hated this movie. Josh Duhamel puts in a decent performance and Cobie Smulders, as Katie's next door neighbor Jo, is immensely likable, the kind of girl you'd want to have for a BFF. The child actors who play Duhamel's kids are terrific. But Julianne Hough did not deliver in her role, and I'm beginning to question if she has the skills necessary to establish a long-term acting career. She's been riding on the coattails of her Dancing with the Stars fame for far too long. There were scenes in this movie that required genuine emotion. Katie was supposed to be crumbling, coming apart at the seams, and Hough couldn't even summon up any tears for her delivery. I hate to say it because I've been rooting for her, but Julianne Hough is just not that talented an actress.<br /><br />Some of the creative decisions in this film were eyeroll-inducing, as well. Katie supposedly fled from her home in the middle of the night, spur of the moment after a fight with her husband. She hurriedly cuts her hair and apparently also bleaches it to avoid being recognized. How does that work, exactly? She was running for her life but she took the time to bleach her hair (not dye it darker, which would have been faster and easier) and she ended up with perfect blondelocks with strategically-placed highlights. Really? Are we supposed to buy that?<br /><br />The big problem that stood out for me- and be warned, this is a minor spoiler- was that I could not figure out how her husband went from lying unconscious and stabbed on their dining room floor to suddenly chasing Katie down as she attempts to flee their town on a bus. I did read the book after watching this movie and discovered that Katie actually fled twice- once to another town to work for just a couple of weeks and get some cash, and once to Southport after her husband found her in the first town. So I'm assuming the fleeing-by-bus scene we saw in the movie happened a few weeks after she first left, but I never would have known that if I hadn't read the book. The movie's story seems poorly cobbled together from the general idea. And switching the hair color to match Hough's natural hair was a terrible idea.<br /><br />Like I said, this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not one I'd recommend. If you have the choice, watch \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" instead. It's a much better version of the tale.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Liam Neeson plays an agent who retires so he can reconnect with his 16 year-old daughter, who has grown up with his ex-wife and her second husband. When the daughter gets a chance to accompany her best friend on a trip to Paris, her father reluctantly gives her permission, but makes her promise to call him as soon as she gets there. During that phone call both girls are violently abducted while the father, helpless, listens. The rest of the movie is his desperate, frantic attempt to find and rescue her before she is sold as a sex slave. Graphic violence, car chases, fights.  I enjoyed it and my husband loved it.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle has been my favorite show for a few years now, but season 5 was the best yet. So many great episodes, topped off by #100, The Lives of Others. The extras with this set are great as well. Be sure to listen to the commentaries included, especially for &#34;The Final Frontier&#34; when star Nathan Fillon and director Jonathon Frakes bring it.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|One of the best ever, an oldy but a goody.  The movie catches your attention at the start and never looses it
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A movie that makes me feel like a boy every time I watch it. Right at the top of my short list of all-time faves.
B000FC146C|5.0|I didn't want this book to end.The author did a superb job developing characters and the story line was informational, historical and believable.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|At first blush the game seemed a bit on the kiddie side due to the bright colors and the cute Panda that the game is based around, but after playing I quickly realized it was deeper than I thought. The game is part tile placement, part color matching and part resource growing. The components of the game are really well made and the panda and gardener figurine are awesome. I have played it about 5 times with people of various board game levels and they have all enjoyed it. The only knock I can think of is that it is not the most friendly game if you are colorblind. I have a friend in my gaming group who is and he had trouble distinguishing two of the colors and there were no symbols to differentiate them
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|So sad this show is over!!! Watch all of them in a couple of days, just plain different and great!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book immensely and just couldn't put it down. The mystery and suspense is both compelling and gripping. The conclusion unpredictable and chilling. Although there were times in the first 3/4 of the book where I thought why didn't our protagonist try this or that, nothing can subtract from the thrill of this book.<br /><br />This horror thriller is a must read for fans of the genre!
0385347774|3.0|guess I'm not a mystery fan and didn't like the husband/wife conflict...sure it was different, but not to make up for storyline.
1442359919|5.0|A little different for King.  A throwback to mysteries with a twist.  Great read.  I enjoy the way he puts words together.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Engaging and often informative. Chris Noth and Juliana Margolis turn in film caliber performances. Taking fodder from the headlines, this show lets us glimpse what life in the world of backstabbing politics might be like.
1847946240|5.0|A very provocative and yet simple book which is well illustrated with real-life examples. It has an easy to read style.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My husband and I were laughing the whole time and our almost 4 yr old loved it! Recommend it for the whole family!!
B00CFYAT6O|3.0|seems the songwriting is not as strong as the first album, great playing... not sure there needs to be a guitar solo every song... i know, i know... but for some reason i am not digging it as much as the first album... we'll see if that changes with a few more plays...
B004HO6I4M|5.0|I bought this movie for my daughter and she loves it! I think it is a cute movie too and the music is nice for younger kids to dance to :) It arrived quickly and was in the original wrapping so I'm very happy with this purchase.
B0088W6Y7K|5.0|Such a great season to such a great show, really disappointed they ended it with this one especially when they introduced some awesome new enemies, and had some great times.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|While I do love Marvel and DC comic turned movies, I'm always hesitate because I want it to be<br />accurately depicted. However with Captain America there were no qualms. It gives a good basis for<br />the birth of the super hero and I enjoyed it immensely. I also recommend this film to anybody else willing to just<br />watch a good action movie or somebody who's a comic junkie and watch Captain America on screen.<br />Hope this helps<br />Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|why was this one pulled off the air? so crazy. Each episode stands alone and each one is so entertaining. Joss Whedon's writing and directing is magic. I bought this video to watch and share. It's been a big hit. Nathan Fillion is more than just eye candy, Baldwin has a great role, great to see Ron Glass again, the female roles were awesome: Jewel Staite, Gina, Morena and Summer were terrific and enchanting. I am so sad this did not continue beyond these episodes and the movie.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great! Lots of fun. My time improves as I continue to play.  Only problem is that it readily becomes addictive.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This was fun to watch and as always Joss Whedon gets a great assembly of actors together and guides them to a terrific performance. And the script-writing is tight! Joss Whedon - you rock!
0880793082|5.0|This is my favorite Tarot deck. I use the larger deck for myself, and this one for other people. I also have other decks. Sometimes a little variety seems nice. You should not quit looking until you find one that &#34;talks&#34; to you when you look at it. This is probably not the best deck for beginners, it's a little more complicated than a Rider deck.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Good movie, funny and relevant.  Decent actors.  See this movie for a light hearted comedy that doesn't require much thought.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love this game, so much fun and very addicting .funny sayings, the customization for the sharks is very cool and original.
030758836X|3.0|The story started off great and was very intriguing, but the ending really sucked.  The ending was unbelievable.  The villain couldn't have gotten away with it.
030758836X|5.0|As new facts get revealed, the readers opinion of what is going on changes. This roller coaster ride reveals to you  thatcthings are not always what they seem. In this work, you quickly turn the page to reveal the next plot surprise, Just  as you adjust to the last turn of events, this imaginative author changes the game on you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This helps to fight boredom of any meeting, waiting at the doctors or just any time you need a filler!
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|When all other tech was failing me, this app stepped in and saved the day!  Easy original file location, quick conversion and flawless file sharing-- worth the three bucks!
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Just not a fan.  I'm sure to most this is a good game...i'm more of a puzzler..just not for me.
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|Ms. Grande has a voice and a star quality that few other have.  This recording does a good job of showing that. All it lacks is a duet with Liz Gillies.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Bought both seasons for my son and he loves having them to watch whenever he wants!  Great gift and great value!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am so glad I found this after seeing what they wanted for it in them store.  I have been waiting own the whole set.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My son love's this show and to have it to watch whenever he wants...it was a great gift!  Great value!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|However i found it redundant and felt the need for expansions$$. Witch i bought and still i feel like im missing something. Overall great game and still a must for every board gamer out there.  If you have to buy one great game, then do yourself a favor and choose Agricola or Ticket to ride europe before this game.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Simple to use, good battery life and powers my 250 ohm cans very well. nice features with the bass boost and gain controls.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is one of the best games i've played on android. It's very fun and addictive. If you haven't played, get it you won't be disappointed.
0142424277|5.0|Matilda in and of itself is a great read, but I really love this edition with the artsy cover. It's a cute addition to any library.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is actually a great game and i got addicted until i finished all the levels not very long..  I took off a star because it just not long enough. Twice the levels would make this game amazing 5 stars.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Trying to minimize my nightstand's electronic collection. This did the trick. With a good lamp app, I may only have the Kindle on my nightstand.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The ending was terrible.... completely didn't expect that. The writing was great though. Different than I figured it would be I suppose
B000QFW7UA|5.0|Amazing collector édition!! If You are a Goonies Fan you must have this Blu-ray! The bonus are very nice. Thank You!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Too much fun I love this version of bingo.  Much better than most. Lo e all the room choices.<br />Fun to be had playing this game
0743289412|5.0|I've read upwards of 20 Stephen King novels and this is the one that I found equally touching and chilling. It's a story about true love in the face of great fear and there is nothing, in my opinion, better than that. I'm also a huge fan of the Dark Tower series, but this as a stand-alone is one of my favorite books from any author.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|This comic book hero was even better than I pictured him when I read the comic books as a kid. I loved the special effects with his body and the interplay between the characters made him very believable. The action was just plain fun. A great family movie.
B0043IMW4W|5.0|I am just getting into the blues & Kenny Wayne Shepherd just pushed me one step closer.  I would recommend it!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Our entire family loves watching this movie. The villain is just awful and turns our favorite good guys into terrible bad guys. He even gets the good guys fighting amongst themselves. But in the end, everyone pulls together to protect the earth and defend civilization. I love it! The humor is biting and fast, the acting isn't bad and the special effects are just plain fun. Another fun superhero movie the whole family can watch.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Very good movie that incorporates magic and keeps you guessing till the end. The acting was superb but then how can you go wrong with Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Woody Harrelson. The rest of the cast was equally good. Great story that w=moves very fast and has a good feel ending. Definitely recommend watching
0312379293|5.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />This is an amusing, entertaining, involving novel that runs about 500 pages. I literally read it through in a day, reading into the night until I finished it. The author concocts a story that begins with a brawl behind a bar, where a young man of humble birth is stabbed to death, and his friend is accused of the crime. The accuser is a lawyer, and you're never really in any doubt that he's the killer too, but he uses his connections to make sure his accusation sticks, and our hero Danny goes to prison. However, while there things happen, and ultimately Danny escapes by assuming another man's identity. The plot then takes many twists and turns, with digressions involving everything from Scottish castles to stamp collections.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed Archer's books. Apparently he's a bit of a scoundrel in British politics, and now retired, but his writing is always clever and smooth, so that you just read on, without losing interest. I'd highly recommend this book.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|Very powerful and gut wrenching film. To see on film how Mother Nature can just happen and in the blink of an eye a countryside is turned upside down is truly amazing. The true life story of this family is a touching and moving story. The ending is most touching. The scenes of the water rising were down so realistically. The story of all those locals who had their own personal hell going on coming to aid tourist is a true testament to how humanity can and should act............
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|This movie is not enjoyable for adults.  The choice to have most of the movie take place in a land that looks like Hello Kitty was splashed across a candy store catering to 5 year old girls was a huge mistake.  That choice ruined what from a technical standpoint must be seen as excellent graphics. The plot was sappy and thin, and I couldn't wait for this to be over.  I know the world is dominated by 5 year olds, but throughout history starting with Warner Brothers' Bugs Bunny, through to Pixar, it's been proven that one doesn't have to pander to make a film that is appealing to children.  This is a weak effort.
B004Y5AV4M|4.0|I can't believe that I had missed this one.  If you like Jane Auston you will enjoy any of Ms. Heyer's regency novels.  This is one of her best.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|This isn't bad, but it isn't great either.  Considering the cast and the resources behind this movie, it should've  been fantastic.  Instead it hinges upon a flimsy premise that has not only been done before, but the movie ADMITS to using a well-worn plot element quite blatantly.  So if one can suspend disbelief, which isn't easy, this is an acceptable comedy with a few laughs.  Something that can be used to watch on a plane but not worthy of setting up the popcorn and the home theater as an &#34;event&#34;.
0345803493|5.0|I'm telling everyone about this book. I enjoyed reading the first one and so now I will have to get the third one to complete my collection!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is a master story teller. If you loved The Kite Runner, you won't be able to put this down. I was sad it ended.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I Can not live without Facebook! So, of course I had to download it on to both my phone and Kindel Fire.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I got the first season and have started watching second.  It really gets a hold of you.<br /><br />If you seek &#34;Revenge&#34;, dig two holes!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I loved it made me mad cause at first I couldn't get the timer but then I figured it out love the app
B000V63AVY|4.0|This collection has all the radio hits I've heard and loved for so long along with a few songs that are new to me.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|The Finis Neptune is probably the best currently available solution for an underwater MP3 player.  It has some flaws, but it's worth a try if you need a player in the pool.  4 stars.<br /><br />Getting good sound quality underwater is a pain; the general solution for most competitive swim teams is to have underwater speakers pumping out music.  The Neptune is a far better solution for most than earplug-based players; simply put this on goggle straps (and under a swim cap too, since it feels far more stable) and you have headphones right by your ears.<br /><br />A few negatives here.  First, the interface is definitely antiquated (as is the 4 GB capacity); this is somewhat reminiscent of the awkward Zen players of a decade ago.<br /><br />Second, as other reviewers have noted, the volume and sound quality is slightly iffy if your head isn't entirely underwater.  Earplugs help, but that defeats half the purpose of the device.  Hence, listening while swimming freestyle as your head rotates can be a bit noisy.  Oddly, the best use of this might be while diving rather than swimming, but there's not much of a market for a scuba MP3 player.<br /><br />4 stars.  It works, not perfectly, but it's worth a try if you want to listen to music or books while swimming laps.
B00138GZAC|4.0|This collection has all the songs I've loved from the radio or videos plus a few that are new to me.
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|Love this film, one of the classic anime films.  Transfer quality is very good, none of the upscaling artifacts from cheaply transferred films.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|I love the zombie genre. I don't mind fast or slow moving zombies. Digital or real effects, both are good in my opinion. But I was a little disappointed with this movie. I have not read the book. I have read the Zombie Survival guide by Brooks, however. Brad Pitt looks very bloated in the face, like he either had a hang over the whole time or was smoking something. Sorry, Pitt, I love ya, but I was uninspired in this flick. I had high hopes in the beginning, but by the ending, I was yawning and getting ready for bed.<br /><br />Pitt's wife, and I don't even remember her name now, in the movie, doesn't seem to be the right fit. Pitt's  shaggy appearance seems like he would be a better fit for working as a sanitation engineer. Not some devoted, loving dad. Not that sanitation engineers can't be loving, devoted dads (or moms). Did the book make it clear what the main character's job was with the UN? Because I can't tell from this movie. It seemed like amateur hour in regards to getting the viewer to connect to the main character. I was waiting for Pitt to get bit by the zombies. He would of made a good one. POTENTIAL SPOILER - The reconnection of him to his family at the end was annoying. It could of been cut out and the movie would of been just fine. I think I would of cut out Pitt entirely. Put someone believable in there. And change the wife. She seems more suited to Downton Abbey than a zombie movie.<br /><br />The zombies. I thought they were scary. The odd, contorted movements, and sounds were crazy good. I wished they had shown more close ups, but you have to wait until the end, when Pitt is in a medical facility, for the camera to focus  on a jaw snapping zombie. Except, that particular zombie could of used a bit more attention to make up. It looked a little Halloween-mask. I can't figure out if the plot moved to quickly, or the shaky camera action or that I couldn't quite hear the dialog very well. No, I don't have a satellite surround system, but we have a nice sub woofer and mid range speakers.<br /><br />I wanted to be more scared at the end. I told my daughter, I had high hopes for this zombie movie. I needed answers; how did the zombies get created, why did the apocalypse happen and how do we get rid of the zombies? Well maybe I should read the book, because my questions remain. The war has only begun? Huh? Meaning a sequel? And I didn't understand the resolution to getting the zombies to avoid humans. Take a dose of another fatal virus? Did they take some antibiotics too? Wouldn't that make everyone in the world die - taking all those virus/bacterial concoctions? Perhaps they wanted to focus on the digital effects in the beginning and try and wrap up the last 1/3 of the movie quickly. It was entertaining, I bought the DVD, will probably watch it during a rainy/snowy day up here in Montana. I must say I'm more excited for the Walking Dead to return.<br /><br />Giving it 4 stars because I liked the zombies.ce sub woofer and mid range speakers.<br /><br />I wanted to be more scared at the end.

B002NUULNG|3.0|Loved the original, the update adds unnecessary re-imagined scenes missing the original feel and flow.  The transitions feel jarring as they move from anime to the new CGI scenes.  The original had CGI scenes intermixed, but the new CGI look out of place from the overall look and feel.
B0040I09RM|5.0|WOW...just found this show.  I have to say that it really sucks you into the world of motorcycle clubs.  I will admit it is heavy on the violence and drugs with a good dose of sex thrown in.  But you really do start to care about these characters even though they do bad, bad things.  Totally would recommend it to anyone.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This series stands up to time and is great fun to watch MacGyver devise all sorts of unlikely widgets.  Plus, the story lines are good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Why minion rush! I love this came so much. It is challenging, fun, and easy to use. I also love all of the new content
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Totally fun and adventurous ride! Perfectly plotted and great character development. I highly recommend to anyone who loves a modern day quest.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Great, brain tease challenging game. Sometimes frustratingly difficult to win but still fun. I come back every day but find the Facebook chatter distracting so I don't participate in that piece.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This new and improved is not good.  And after reading about how this app sucks the battery life out of the kindle I will be removing it.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|One of the best movies ever made, pre-ordered it 3 months in advance only to have item damaged and blu ray disk scracted upon receiving it! Submitted replacement form!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Casts are charming, law drama very enjoyable, and story moves along and keeps wife and I interested on coming back.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have this game on my iphone and I did not know until now I could have had this on my kindle I love it!!!!
0345529057|5.0|I'm definitely a Game of Thrones fan.  Didn't even know about the books until my son told me about them.  I am glad I've read up on the story lines.  The series and the books do not disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This one is a real hit at our house. My granddaughter loves horses and, whenever<br />she can she loves to go riding. This is a great sustitute!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|very interesting you should read this book.  Fairly concise and the source material is just as informative.  Have never read through 100 pages of source material before this.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Very short game. I like the change of playing pieces though. I was through the whole game in a matter of days.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie and all the stars in it. Cant think of any thing else to say about it.
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|This movie was a fun return to the original lore of the Thing from both the 50's and 80's.  An enjoyable popcorn movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|i  loved the series on pbs masterpiece theater, so bought the video. now I can watch it as often as I like.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Keeps me busy and thinking when I have nothing else to do..not very hard and better than other games that are way too difficult.
B00COCY67A|5.0|First of all, the product itself is larger than I expected. Then again, Elvis was larger than life, so the album size fits. So many memorable songs in this rare album, you'll want to listen to this again and again.....and again! Both the live and studio sessions are memorable as you listen and retain every note and lyric from this 3 disc album. Long live the King if Rick 'N Roll....Elvis Presley!!
B007MJSSCY|5.0|A movie the whole family can watch and enjoy. The story is one that will entertain from beginning to end.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|Sheryl hits a home run.  There are multiple top ten hits on this album.  &#34;Callin me when I'm lonely&#34; is going to be a monster radio hit.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|A very refreshing movie covering the feelings of people with dementia. Very nicely covered a joy to have watched. Would recommend it to anyone.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so awesome.The best thing about this game is that it is very challenging.In fact before I was having issues with my memory and now I'm doing much better.Your mind has to be tip top to keep up with the others. There is one thing I don't like. They offer chances for you to earn free coins and stuff but I never receive the free stuff and I know I'm doing every step they asked me to do. Hopefully they can make it easier or make their directions to claim credits more specific because I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Great movies!  A must own for anyone that loves any of the Bourne action movies. Would definitely recommend these to your library.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|The cutest movie with great quality! I couldn't find this anywhere and this is perfect! Couldn't ask for better quality.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game, it is a lot of fun, I love getting new recipes, and being able to visit neighboring restaurants,and being able to leave tips and gifts is a lot of fun too. Visiting the other restaurants gives you a lot of decorating ideas for your own restaurant. Children would love to play this game, however as an adult, it's one of our guilty pleasures.
B005LAII80|5.0|I am putting my 2 cents. Everyone has already reviewed the movie, the bluray, the special features, the packaging, the cellophane wrap around the packaging, etc. etc.<br />We all know this movie is amazing and it was a travesty that this movie bombed at the box office.<br />Buying this movie will let the movie studios to take notice that this movie IS profitable and DOES deserve a sequel (and not another bloody Transformers sequel).<br /><br />Here's hoping for a Dredd trilogy (which the makers were hinting at). Judge Dredd vs the Dark Judges!!
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|One of the best 3D movies ever!  Disney did a great with the story line.  This one is a must see.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|A down-and-out but very handsome young man in Paris meets a man he knew when they were both soldiers in Africa, and gets an invitation to dinner.  At the dinner, he meets the man's wife (Uma Thurman showing lots of cleavage), and two of their friends (played by Kristin Scott-Thomas and Christina Ricci), all of whom he eventually seduces.  The young man is extremely selfish and amoral, and finds success through the women.  This is based on a French novel, so do not expect the young man to come to a bad end or to learn morals.<br /><br />This film reminded me of Cousine Bette where Jessica Lange got away with her revenge.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|Because it doesn't allow me to see what I'm taking a picture of.To hard to turn the screen towards the item to photo and take a good picture.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I was very pleased with the product. The reason I purchased this is because the one I purchased about a year ago started to wear the rubber coating off and the wires began to be exposed. I didn't feel this was safe so I ordered another one.
B005PK57IK|5.0|My mom had loved this show and I knew I would like it and LOVE option on Amazon prime to watch when and where I want - just sad b/c already to season 4 and I watch it to work out and on ipad to go to sleep.  Good drama and story line.
B0063GORYU|5.0|really enjoy the game.  always trying to better my score or my time.  passes many hours waiting for my shopping wife when reading doesn't interest me
B0094MFITS|4.0|Nice entertaining movie. Not the greatest or most exciting, but entertaining. Was a nice way to spend an evening. Liked it.
B0087K3VTW|5.0|I really enjoyed this original and very &#34;2010's&#34; story about books, technology, and the lure of an old fashioned mystery. It would be a good beach read, and I'd recommend it for a book club choice.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Mud is a great film. I really enjoyed it ,and would recommend it to anyone.<br />Ty Sheridan is a great little actor.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I find that having two ports has been very handy in my older cars that are not equipped with USB
B0067Q42BY|2.0|First thing when i opened this app was being greeted with a full screen ad for the companies other products. I got it as FAOTD, but ads in a paid app is not acceptable. Uninstalled.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game with very realistic graphics. This is a great way to zone out and do nothing important for a while. The only downside is if you don't want to spend your real money it takes a long time to accomplish goals.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Enjoyable story.  I can hardly wait for the movie of your book.  Sending Wickham and Lydia to the New World was genius.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Awesome movie! Def glad I downloaded it. Will be watching it again. Downey is perfect as Tony Stark. Loved it.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Suspenseful sci-fi drama at its finest. After watching the pilot, I was hooked; absolutely fabulous TV entertainment! Unique theme, wonderful cast of characters, and great performance make for some delightful TV viewing...highly recommend!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Although I am older and shouldn't like this type of show I do!!  It is very funny and I am enjoying it very much!
B00563K3DA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It takes you away from the daily routine and gets you thinking. It has really changed the way I see life.
B0031RSA24|5.0|I loved Dawkins'  'The God Delusion',<br />Never has the task of deconstructing the arbitrary, irrational, self serving 'beliefs' that constitute Theistic forms of religion been so urgent.  Full power to Richard Dawkins and this book.  Long may he live.  This book should be placed in Hotel room drawers<br />instead of Gideons Bible.<br /><br />Colin Taylor
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|FOUL!!! This item is not even interesting, only takes about five minutes to say, to heck with it, fly through a circle and try to land a crippled plane that you never see!!! To me this one was a complet waste of time, better luck next time..
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|A true hard core fan of the Band would know the Watkins Glen CD had very little Watkins Glen music on it.
B00B9EQS98|4.0|GURANTEED LAUGH A MINUTE, THIS ONE HAS IT ALL, CUTE MOVIE FOR FAIMLY ENTERTAINTEMENT!!!! THIS ONES A KEEPER. I HOPE THEYS A PART TWO.

034580404X|5.0|I just had to have the triology and coming on amazon was the best place to get the book in new looking condition for a great low price.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|An extraordinary, funny, somewhat tragic account of what can go wrong in a marriage when a couple allows it to be routine and dull.  The interaction of the various characters is somewhat unusual, but the maturation of the leads and supporting actors is worthy of note.  The teenage characters add spice and direction to two parents lost in their own disappointments with the reality of life.

B005XUC398|2.0|This story is worth telling. However, I found myself falling asleep during many moments of non crucial &#34;b&#34; footage. I felt the ending was kind of a fizzle.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Having read some of the negative reviews of Star Trek into Darkness I was expecting a scene by scene rip off of The Wrath of Khan from 1982. In reality, the new Star Trek film is more a remake or even a prequel to the first film.  The plot changes are substantial with Benedict Cumberbatch's coldly calculating Khan seeking revenge for the supposed murder of his crew and Peter Weller as Admiral Marcus, who uses Khan to develop super weapons and sends the Enterprise to unwittingly start a war with the Kligons.  While there are some similarities to the Wrath of Khan (a few lines of dialogue and the reactor malfunction) the new Star Trek has a refreshing plot line with the creation of a new and fascinating Khan.<br /><br />For me, this really an ensemble film with the actors filling out their roles from the first film.  The interactions between Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachery Quinto mirror that of William Shattner and Leonard Nimoy but they add their own spin to their characters, making them their own. The supporting cast -  John Cho (as Sulu), Simon Pegg (as Scotty), Anton Yelchin (as Chekov), and Karl Urban (as McCoy) - all have sizeable roles in the film.  Simon Pegg and Karl Urban were especially fun to see with McCoy's one liners and Scotty's excitability over the state of the Enterprise's engines.<br /><br />JJ Abrams provides the same high level of action as he did in his first venture into the Star Trek franchise. The mix of action and character development is well-balanced. The special effects fit the story rather than the other way around. The futuristic San Francisco was marvelous to behold. Altogether this is a terrific action science-fiction film.

B007G5H2HQ|3.0|Puss In Boots was an ok movie for adults and an entertaining movie for 6 years and under.  It served its purpose as a family movie night and we're glad we watched it.  It's not a movie I would buy or watch again, unless the 6 year old wants to!
B00A285OOW|3.0|I like Philippa Gregory books a lot, particularly the Cousins' War series.  Her writing style not only makes it easy to become wrapped up in a centuries-old world, but it's very clean as well.  I find a lot of historical fiction to be full of cliches with thinly drawn characters since so much focus is on the details of the time period, but I've never thought that about a Philippa Gregory book.  Her characters are always complex, characters I could just as easily see in modern fiction.  This one, however, was a little boring.  Maybe it's the subject matter -- I'm used to the heroines in the Cousins' War books being fierce and self-determined, and the heroine in this book is so passive. But it just wasn't as good as previous books, particularly The White Queen.
0788859544|4.0|The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition) - Even adults like this movie. It's Disney and very few of them are bummers.  This is a fun movie for family movie night.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the individual character stories this season.  Great series with great actors.  Evan Peters is so good looking too!!!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Everything for every taste in music is offered.  Very specific categories can be chosen for personal or group listening.  Excellent.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book.  Couldn't wait until my sister (the former librarian) read it!  She read it in 2 days and called me the moment she finished it.  It is so well done and perfectly reflects how a young woman would approach a totally new situation and could do the very best thing for a man who could no longer function as he had due to a horrible accident.  So well done and hard to put down.  Great book!
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|I wont review the album, listen to it, judge for yourself. I for one, love it. And this vinyl pressing is wonderful, if you enjoy Tame Impala and vinyl, I'd definitely recommend it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I'd borrowed this exact anthology from a coworker a few months back and watched all the movies in blu-ray.  Once I saw this advertised for a certain low price, I couldn't pass it up and decided to buy the anthology for myself, wanting to go back and watch all the bonus features.  Beautiful packing and quite the addition to any movie buffs collection.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A lot of great information about the story of Jobs and Apple, none of it sugar coated. A must read for fans of the company and anyone interested in tech.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|The book started off so interesting. I was completely hooked on it and considered it to be the first book on any required reading list to be actually good or worthwhile. Please understand, I love books. I adore them and I can usually smell a bad one a mile away. This book, however, surprised me. You are started off in such an interesting world with so much of a back story left unexplained in the beginning. So, naturally, you would think that this story ends with some sort of ending thought the connects it to modern society. What in fact happened was a boy ran away from home, hid in the woods, the end. What? Talk about a book with so much potential with such a disappointing ending. I started the next book to see if it would shed some light upon what I just read. Nope. Instead I get an unbearably boring sequel that I was forced to ditch after the tenth page. I would not highly recommend this book.
0770437400|5.0|World War Z paints a comprehensive and detailed picture of the global zombie war. The unnamed narrator interviews a wide variety of people from all around the globe ten years after the zombie war. It was first intended as a government report, but all of the human element was removed from it to reveal the facts. The narrator opts to write a book detailing how different individual people felt and what happened to them during that horrible time in human history. For each story, a short introduction of the person and setting is followed by that person's first person account of what happened interspersed with the narrator's questions either for clarification or to elaborate on a subject. It reads as a nonfiction historical book and a harrowing one at that.<br /><br />None of those interviewed know each other and aren't connected in any way, but their narratives tell the entire story of the zombie war, from patient zero to world ten years after the declared end of the zombie war (although millions still walk the earth). The people interviewed ranged from high ranking government officials to members of the military to scientists to ordinary people trying to survive. These stories showed the best and worst of human nature as well as the simple horror living in such a time. Each character was fully realized with their own insights, motivation, and reactions. Many of the stories were more emotional than I expected and really packed a punch.<br /><br />My favorite story is about a famous filmmaker working hard to film and show an account of a group of college students staving off thousands of zombies at their university. He thought it bombed at first because people didn't seem too enthused at his showing and he moved on with his life. It was later revealed to be a huge hit and he went on to make many more. Suicides and sudden deaths went down drastically, showing that art can have a profound effect on people. It gave them hope when all seemed bleak. One of the most despicablecharacters was an opportunistic businessman that created an untested vaccine in the US that didn't work, but made millions of dollars. He justified it treated rabies, which is what the virus was originally called. He has no remorse for the damage he caused, which largely contributed to the Great Panic, the panicked and chaotic realization that the zombies are real.<br /><br />This war was completely different than any other war. Each and every zombie is working 24 hours a day to end life on earth. They don't tire or weaken or die naturally. Every human casualty weakens us and strengthens them. This is war as no one has ever seen. Existing weapons don't take into account that wounds, even normally fatal ones, don't matter to the undead, so many of them are useless. Tactics and weapons have to be completely rethought to accommodate the new enemies' weaknesses or lack thereof. Most countries don't have many resources or the manpower to completely re-evaluate how they fight, especially when they are trying to stave off the total collapse of their government and society at the same time. These zombies are slow and shuffley, but this doesn't mean they are easy to kill or safe to be around. Their moans can signal zombies from miles around and set off a domino effect until there are thousands of zombies called to your location. Numbers are always on their side since there are more of them and less of us every day.<br /><br />World War Z is the most well researched, detailed zombie novel I've ever read. It presents itself as history and puts the events in context of actual history. It's definitely one of my favorites and I notice more and more with each reread. The novel is ultimately optimistic. This is the only book I've read where humans actually win over zombies and the majority of people were shown to be decent, resilient, and honorable. Most zombie novels are bleak and incredibly depressing, but this one manages to send out a hopeful message.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game was fun to play, even with my grandchildren, after I got the hang of what I was supposed to do.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This is NOT a horror novel...this is a ROMANCE novel.  It's also unresolved at the end, so be prepared to read part 2 (which I did not, so I can't tell you if it was all worthwhile).
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What's with the dialogue...this is Seattle, not the UK, right? Or maybe it's because I'm a 25 yr old guy. In any case I'll be reading book 2 :P
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|After all those glorious reviews naturally the expectations are very high, turns out, quiet the opposite. The beginning is really hard to follow, a lot of characters thrown in the mix, without much of the development. I had wondered where is the plot, was tempted to give it 1 star review and be done with this book, but i carried on, the mid of the book actually was a success, not brilliant, but very good, that part, I'd give 4 stars, but the ending, oh the ending, predictable and very very disappointing. i would not recommend this book to anybody that i know. 3 stars is a very generous rating, it's actually 2.5
B005LAII80|5.0|I saw Dredd in theaters, and absolutely loved it. It was violent, fun, and true to the source material. Bought the Blu-Ray and the quality is amazing. I give it 5 stars.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this series.  I can't wait until season 5 is complete and is on Prime. I did not watch this series on TV but I see what I missed.  Glad it is on Prime
B002SGYPS2|5.0|I feel this was one of Jim Carrey's best performances. His penchant to overact actually enhanced the character and the story underneath is moving and carries a strong, uplifting message.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This really is the best show on TV and the fact that I can watch again the show all at once is just great.
B009LDD1X0|1.0|I purchased this item and it was delivered on time. The problem was that it came with two Disc One cds and one Disc Three. There was not a disc two. So how could this problem be resolved?
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I had already seen this season so I could wait to see the extra content and blu-ray quality. I was not disappointed!
147674355X|5.0|I went into this book thinking it was a romance about a young couple.  I quickly realized it was so far beyond that.<br />This book touched me in places that nothing has ever come close to.  I have never ended a book in such an emotional state.<br />Without any spoilers I just want to say that any negative reviews obviously come from people who have never in their life lived through any sort of emotional pain.<br /><br />I couldn't put the book down.  I urge you, if you are on the fence, READ THIS BOOK!  You will not regret it.
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|Stephen Stills has done a lot of great stuff over the years & this is no exception!  Teamed up with another heavy-weight guitar-slinger, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, he rises to the occasion with some of his strongest work in decades.  Barry Goldberg adds some legitimate blues to the mix, making this a welcome addition to my extensive Stills collection!
B000W93CHC|2.0|It was our summer book club selection, so I read it through to the end; but it was painful getting through its thousand-plus pages. So many archvillains! Ken Follett is a great writer, but this book wasn't worthy of his enormous talent.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|The original &#34;Self Portrait&#34; album took a lot of flack at the time of it's release, but I always enjoyed it a lot.  &#34;New Morning&#34; was a brilliant album & has always been one of my favorite Dylan releases.  This new offering, with extensive outtakes and alternate versions from the period, has quickly become one of my favorites from the &#34;Bootleg&#34; series that he's been slowly sharing over the years.  This is a gem ... classic Bob Dylan from a wonderful laid-back period of his masterful career!
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie.  I was packaged neatly, and brand new.  Definitely a movie I watch when I'm in the mood for a kiddie movie.
193700788X|2.0|WARNING - SPOILERS THROUGHOUT, INCLUDING THE ENDING<br />\\"I'd been waiting for the vampire for years when he walked into the bar.\\" was the first line in the series.<br /><br /> It ends with: \\"I'm Sookie Stackhouse. And I belong here.\\" Epic lines.<br /><br />Sookie stays home a lot in the book. I think the biggest downer about this book is the lack of excitement. I always enjoyed that she went out to work and different places and interactions. At the beginning of the book she's upset over Eric (although that's a bit hard to tell) and confused by Sam so takes days off to mope at home, wonder on email, and take a shopping trip with Tara to a used clothing store. Of course it's nailed in on Tara's new twins. She also takes time off when she's injured, she has to be away from work when in jail, and then there's a period where Sam's not allowing her to come into work. We get a lot of her organizing, cleaning, dressing, sunbathing, musing.<br /><br />Telepathy is no longer that important. There was magic in the earlier books. Sookie was a person struggling as a supernatural in her small town that feared her, and then she encountered other supernaturals and was thrust in the world of danger, intrigue, and excitement. In this book it's like everyone and their cousin is a telepath (Barry is around a lot for some reason) and the vamps no longer have interest in her abilities. They make it sound like Eric's protection stopped vamps from messing with her because of her being his vamp wife. Before they left her alone because of that and he was over her, but they were always really intrigued by taking her as their own for her abilities. Now it's like they don't care.<br /><br />This book holds no mystery. Part of it was because there are now multiple points of view where we always know what's going on and the reader no longer has to figure it out along with the reader. The POV shifts were confusing. For every book it's always been told through Sookie's point of view. In this book there are different points of view. It would have been better if doing this to be in the head of main characters where we always wondered what they think, but no, these viewpoints are one time Barry the Bellboy and the new villain invented for the story.<br /><br />Many characters came in just to make exit scenes. Seriously, it was awesome that all the mains from the previous books were seen again but some of these scenes were just awkward. Alcide comes in once to sniff around her room and mention how in love he is with this new woman about to be made pack. Quinn comes out of nowhere to sniff her woods for a day and say he heard she needed help on the Supernatural help board. Um, what on earth is that?<br /><br />The relationship with Sam was forced feeling and there was no romance or passion to me. It was predictable who she would end up with, I think, and the author felt invested in it, but she shouldn't have it happen suddenly the last few chapters without any romantic buildup. And that sex scene? It lasted one paragraph and was painfully non-erotic. It was the opposite of erotic. Rubbed together like seals because of sweat? Gross.<br /><br />The villains made little sense. The likelihood of those three getting together for revenge makes no sense to me. Those three would not pair. The ringleader is supposed to be powerful and a loner so why would he ever get the other two together? Steve never mattered in the books, was he chosen as a nod to the show? The way the ringleader got out was silly too and made little sense to me.<br /><br />Also, what is with the ending? I almost forgot they had to resolve the main plot since it was saved for the last ten pages and resolved so quickly and easily. It's like a bad B movie how Sookie made them turn on each other in the car. The dialogue was horrible and it was completely unrealistic. They grabbed her from a line dancing bar, really? In front of everyone and were chased down? I can't see these people acting like that.<br /><br />Copley Carmichael and Cluvial Dor also makes no sense to me. If he makes a deal with a demon to have any wish he wants, why would he wish for the item that would grant him one wish? Why not just wish for it directly? I guess for a reason for him to hate Sookie? Yeah, Copley was never a good character and he was greedy, but I didn't anticipate the evilness they would have in this book for him.<br /><br />How Eric ends up is just sad and it doesn't seem like it would make him that happy. Amelia comes in and says of course he'd be happy to move out and not be the sheriff of a backwater town. Um, previously he was happy and Shreveport was considered a big deal to manage right? He was in charge of it and his group. Now he's been sold by his maker for 200 years as a consort/sex slave/arm candy to a cold queen vampire, forced to leave his children behind.<br /><br />The vampires have been cut off by a massive wall. Sookie is not even ever allowed to go into Fangtasia again. Seriously. She is even cut off from ever visiting the state Eric moved to. The vampires are so barely there it's like they don't exist.<br /><br />Pam and the invented Karin finally show up. Was Karin thrown in as another woman similar to Sookie and Pam to show Eric made another child as he intended with Sookie? They both sit at the end and say they love Eric but he couldn't care for Sookie and wasn't the one for her in their minds. Hint, hint, wink, wink, nudge, NUDGE.<br /><br />As with previous books lately, Eric is a robot without emotion. Gone is the flirty, fun, sexy, dynamic personality. He is barely there and speaks maybe five lines in the entire book. He never has emotion and it's like Harris wants the readers to dislike him. Pam is there for two scenes and one she is completely unlike herself. Bill is there but even he seems emptier than normal. Even Jason, I think, isn't the same as he used to be. Could it be the show has ruined it? Since it aired Harris has started draining the spark from some of the personalities.<br /><br />Even though this book is far from perfect, I still do and always will love Sookie and the Sookieverse. I prefer remembering some of the characters as they once were instead of how they are now. I still respect the author and will keep reading her stuff. She has provided years of laughter, joy, sadness and excitement for me as a reader.><br />Copley Carmichael and Cluvial Dor also makes no sense to me.

B008QPCCQQ|5.0|Usually I stick with the free version of the classics, but this upgrade was worth it.  $2 isn't much, but you get pretty much everything Louisa Alcott ever wrote.  I was delighted to find stories I never knew existed.  You can navigate to any book, chapter, or short story.  The font is easy to read, and I haven't found any of the typos that plague the free versions.<br /><br />Louis May Alcott is an American treasure.  Her characters inhabit a world very different from ours, and yet they feel completely realistic.  It's easy to step into their world and feel at home.  Modern media rewards that which is shocking and extreme; Alcott gently reminds us of more simple, peaceful, uplifting values.  Many stories focus on people who face tough times but try to stay cheerful and be kind to each other.<br /><br />Note for guys:  these books aren't just for girls.  Alcott had great affection for boys of all ages, and many of her stories feature just as many Tom Sawyer-ish boys as girls.

B00F91RYL8|1.0|Rent first or better yet, watch some one else's copy of it. This movie is a loss and not worthy of a one star rating.  Action sequences of stampeding zombies are recycled, (we've seen it before in Lord of the Rings \\"Army of the Dead\\"), the story line is disjointed, uninteresting and so predictable. Nothing chilling about this movie. The book is compelling and more believable. Read the book if you want a good scare.

B00EMJD6TC|2.0|Some good scenes and ideas, but it does not hold together well and lacks drama. Feels more like a collection of scenes of varying quality and effect but disjointed as a whole. Brad Pitt's performance was so low key and ineffective that I suspected he was a closet zombie himself :!

B009MO5960|4.0|Love the action and special effects. I'm a Mila fan I love all the Resident Evil Movies. She just doesn't take crap from anyone dead or alive!!!!!!
B007EECSFA|4.0|Fascinating story revolving around war and the way this family was molded because of it.  The journey to the twist near the end makes everything clear and worth the read.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|The speical effects is very good. Very entertaining movie, they did a good job in making the comic book a movie.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I think John Mayer is getting better musically as he gets older. This album is one of his most country like album with a good mix of blues and just a slight tinge of pop. I loved every track on it. I have already recommend it to many friends. If he keeps going like this, I can't wait for the next album
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Good read funny along with serious. I would tell my friends to read it I will read the rest of the series.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|I bought this full album because of Sara's beautiful voice. Her vocals on Gravity are so beautiful it could bring you to tears if you were feeling emotional.
B008J05EL8|2.0|Can only view word docs.  Have to purchase additional app to view .pdf document. Cannot create a document. I can do more with Dropbox and it is free.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game because you are able to build your own jurassic park land or sea. love this game.

B008M721MS|2.0|I've loaded and reloaded this app 3 times. Called Kindle up they say my camera works fine. Can't call Skype unless I pay, so that doesn't sound like a good idea.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|This was the first ablum by Blake shelton i have ever purchased. The only song i really don't care to hear on it is Boys round here. Thats probably because it is over played on the radio and i am just so tired of hearing it. Great album with lots of great songs.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I did not like this as much as I wanted to.  I wanted to fall in love with it, to have it be my new addiction and it just wasn't.  But, I must say I did like it just fine.<br /><br />When Grace was a small girl, she was attacked by wild wolves and taken into the woods to be eaten.  She was saved by one wolf, one with yellow eyes.  She watches for him every night, unafraid of the consequences.  Now in their teens, Grace meets a handsome boy with yellow eyes.  he feels so familiar to her.  Grace soon finds out why.  Sam, the yellow-eyed boy, is also the yellow-eyed wolf.  He's a werewolf who can only stay human as long as the weather is warm. When it turns cold outside, Sam's body, against his will, turns into a wolf.  He only has a short time to be with Grace before he turns into a wolf forever.<br /><br />There is also another threat to their burgeoning romance--Sam is afraid this might be his last summer as a human.  It is harder and harder to change back and he feels the wolf taking him over completely.  Is it safe to be around Grace?  Is it smart?<br /><br />The one thing I really didn't like about the book was the absolute clue-lessness of Grace's parents.  Sam practically lives in Grace's bedroom, sleeping with her every night and her parents were  none the wiser.  It felt so unbelievable to me and brought me out of the story.<br /><br />I liked the plot and the writing was beautiful.  I felt the book gathered speed and momentum as it went along.  I will definitely be reading the next one--I just don't feel the need to rush and buy it right this moment.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I watched this after falling in love with season 1. This one was different and equally good. The story line didn't always go the way I wanted it to go - it was gritty and painful at times - yet it went to where it should have gone. The writing, acting and directing are great, in my humble opinion, and I'm hooked. I'm not sure I could think of another show that would compare with this one so I just won't try.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I could not get past the set up screen.  The Next button during the set up did not work for me and I could not use it.  Deleted the app.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I wasn't going to watch this but an NPR interview with Katie Segal (sp) made me reconsider. I'm really glad I did. This shows a good story of a family - blood and extended by choice - and all the struggles they go through. It isn't always nice, well never really, and it isn't showing the biker life as glamorous, but it seems real enough and it shows a lot more depth than I ever expected. I recommend this whole season for someone wanting more meaning to watching tv and to someone looking to learn a bit about a different culture.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was a good movie to pass the time but I could predict what was going to happen next.  It was a good action flick.
B00BIPMGD0|4.0|Both my wife and I are enjoying The Good Wife. There is a different law case in each episode and a continuing story which is interesting. Besides Margeles and Panjabi are not bad to look at!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is so funny. Make sure that you have gotten you drinks and snacks ready. You will not be able to get up and leave it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Exciting, funny and totally sucks you in. Great storylines and brilliant character development as you go through the season. Straight onto season 2
B001QL5MAA|5.0|I read House of Suns first (which was great) and wanted more of this author. I was not disappointed! I will be reading more of this author...
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|One of my favorite books and now one of my favorite movies! Lurhman captured the story perfectly and both Leo and Tobey are perfect, bringing their characters to life!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for season 4!  Like a good book you can't put down.  Colorful personalities make the story interesting.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I play this everyday, it's easily the best Sudoku game I've downloaded.  I got it as the FAOTD and it's entirely add free, with no distracting art or busy design.  Has a useful hint system if you get stuck.<br />Galaxy S2 (skyrocket)
B0086213XW|2.0|A story about a love triangle that somehow manages to have no dramatic tension.  The last scene managed to rise slightly above the rest of the film in terms of emotion, but it was too little too late.  On a positive note, it was beautifully shot.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Entertaining and interesting direction for Star Trek. Nothing revolutionary but welcome all the same. Some rough spots in the film. I did appreciate the emotional connections of the characters
B00F2362IE|1.0|I bought the game tonight for my son. It will not even open. Error message pops up saying that it cannot open. I now have a sad little boy and wasted four dollars.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought these as an upgrade to my G35s which had just died. Sadly, I was not able to use them for long since the headset picks up interference, which causes static in the left speaker. I tried different version of the LGS software to no avail, and even tried changing the channel of my wireless router. Sadly, nothing helped, so I was forced to return these.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is the best game I've ever played.<br />I'll gave this game a five star rating of a resion
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am so intrigued that I want to enter the legal profession-and live just like them! Oh and Matt is just so sexy :-)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|you can not free stream this show from anywhere. Not even from amc itself. So in order to catch up for season four I figured to buy the season now.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Pre-ordered and received on day of release. Watched entire season in 3 days!  Cannot wait for season 11 to start, then will own that also, when released.
B00DBSZT7C|4.0|Maybe not the very best it could of been, but still well worth the time watching it in my opinion.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman is a master storyteller, and this tale is no exception. The prose is as fluid as the story, effortlessly gliding between the magical and the conventional. I absolutely loved it and would recommend to everyone.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed Ender's Game & considering when it was written, how amazingly predictive Orson Scott Card was regarding technology that would appear in the future (our now)- I found that particularly fascinating.  The story was gripping & pulled you through until the end which I found completely bizarre.  I'd like to think it will make sense in the sequels, but I admit I don't feel compelled to read them.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Very easy to read. Loved the book, loved the kindle even more! Kindle is the way to go these days! I love making the text just a little bit bigger so I don't need my reading glasses!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I only knew two things about this movie:  1) My husband wanted to see it and 2) Brad Pitt is in it.  I don't normally care for Zombie movies, but this was good.  The movie kept our attention to the end.  It wasn't as graphic as it could have been, but definitely not  recommended for children.  These are not your typical slow-moving, stiff, Halloween zombies; Walking Dead zombies, they are not!  This movie doesn't have a clear start of how the people became zombies so you are thrown into action quickly, and there is no clear ending of how to get people back to &#34;normal.&#34;  Brad Pitt and his family are the main characters at the beginning but the movie shifts to Brad being the focus of how he is going to save not only his family but the country/world from this certain terrible fate.  I don't think it should be compared to War of the Worlds, which was bloodier and darker in my opinion.  There is suspense in this movie and visible fear of the unknown.  No, it's not realistic but it's not supposed to be.  Since I didn't have any expectations about this movie, I was pleasantly surprised.  It is certainly not Brad's best movie, but it was nice to see him in an action zombie movie.  Overall, we were entertained and enjoyed the movie.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I have really enjoyed Homeland.  Season one was super and I looked forward to being able to see Season 2...I went back and looked at my streaming season one to get up to date with the continuing story..Glad I got it ...This year was DVD and I am goad..
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Glad those dinos can't escape like the movie, my grandson has learned so much from this app he just loves it, thank you so much
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I heard so much about the History of the Eagles that I had to get it...Fine, fine music and the performers are very interesting and different..I now have the Final Tour 1 ...the are older, clean cut and wearing suits...Great music and have become better people when aging..
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this was a favorite APP for my grandson 7 years old ,we built up such a wonderful reef and learned so much..but then it would not work for us..what went wrong?
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I truly have become a great fan of the Eagles...On this final tour, they are much older, clean cut and are going out as better people...Truly a fine disc with great music and performance...The crowd was great and appreciated the return of the Eagles..
1416914285|2.0|I'm a bit of a weirdo. I don't actually mind when fanfiction gets turned into book form...as long as it is worth reading and it makes some effort to not be a ripoff of the original story. When it comes right down to it, this book and the series that it belongs to just aren't worth reading and they have obvious issues with copying from other books, as well as television and movie series.<br /><br />I tried not to read up on the series or its writer before I started reading these books. I know that there was some serious drama-llamaing a few years ago on LiveJournal, but I tried to ignore that and be as objective as possible while reading these stories. So when I say that I didn't like the stories, I don't mean that I don't like the author's past, I just mean that I found the stories to be seriously lacking in many ways.<br /><br />They aren't well-written at all. Even though the story's plot may seem original, it isn't. I would suggest readers watch at least the first two movies in The Prophecy franchise, as well as read the books in the Harry Potter series (where the fanfiction version of this originated), Star Wars, and the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I almost started a list while reading this of all the episodes, movies, and books where a scene would be swiped from. Her inability to come up with an original plot wasn't the only thing wrong with the writing. The actual writing was bad. It was choppy. I would read a sentence, then have to take a break and try to go on to the next sentence. It felt like English wasn't really even her first language. And the editing, don't get me started on that. The errors in this book were just so shocking.<br /><br />The characters weren't all that interesting. They were so trope-y and stereotypical. There is no growth by any of them. If anything, they actually get worse as the story goes on. I was offended by the way that Magnus is basically portrayed as a slut because he's bisexual. Bisexual characters always get that kind of treatment in books, and that's a major reading pet peeve of mine.<br /><br />And the incestuous nature of the lead characters' relationship is just grotesque. I don't care if they end up finding out that they aren't siblings or not. Incest is not sexy. And I feel like this series almost tries to glamorize it.<br /><br />I cannot understand how this book is popular or even liked by anyone. It's awful. It's offensive. If you haven't read it already, please don't waste your time in checking it out. It really isn't worth it.that kind of treatment in books, and that's a major reading pet peeve of mine.<br /><br />And the incestuous nature of the lead characters' relationship is just grotesque.

B00ENNA62W|5.0|I cannot fully express how excited I am to discover that this combo release will include BOTH english language dubs, the original released by Streamline Entertainment and the newer one by Pioneer. This is a great moment for those of us who grew up with the original dub and where consequently disappointed with the first DVD release. I can't wait.<br /><br />A warning to those who have never seen this film. As you watch this, bear in mind that this was produced quite a few years before the advent of computer rendered graphics in films. This, to us fans, is perhaps the single most attractive aspect of this work of art. Every single frame in this movie was hand drawn. Every single individual in a crowd of people is animated separately. This is what makes this movie a landmark in animation history. I hope you find it as astounding as I did when I first watched it.
030758836X|2.0|I know that this novel was one of the most popular ones released this year, but I just didn't enjoy it as much as most people seemed to. Don't get me wrong. The book was interesting and it was somewhat well written, but there was just so much about it that I didn't like.<br /><br />It was so easy to figure out that Amy was not quite what she seemed, and what had really happened. The mystery element just wasn't really all that mysterious. Predictablility in mysteries is a very, very bad thing.<br /><br />I loathed almost every single character in the book, not just the main ones. All of them seemed positively revolting. The worst character was Amy. She was just a horrible person. She wasn't just a sociopath, she was a dangerous, narcissistic sociopath. If she were a Criminal Minds character, the BAU would basically be telling the local cops that if they ran into her, they would probably have to kill her. She had no redeeming qualities. And her sob story about how her parents dehumanized her by making her and every mistake she made into a book character that everyone could judge? I didn't feel sympathetic toward her.<br /><br />And Nick? Poor Nick. He had an abusive father and a sainted mother. He also had a twin with whom he seemed to have a semi-incestuous relationship with. While I pitied him for marrying a sociopath, I found him to still be a despicable jerk who was somewhat deserving of the plot that his crazy wife came up with.<br /><br />These were miserable people who deserved their misery-filled lives. The only people who didn't deserve this level of misery were the readers. The only reason that I felt compelled to keep reading was, like with other books I've read, I wanted to see just how messed up the story would end up being.<br /><br />Oh, and this an odd warning, but it's an important one nonetheless. If you're prone to migraines, you might want to seriously reconsider reading this book. By about a quarter of the way in, I had one of the worst migraines that I've ever had. And for me, that is saying something.that I've ever had. And for me, that is saying something.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Wonderful book, learned more than I tought,genius,generosity,creativity and about an awesome mind Tesla the \\"Genius of the Twentieth Century\\"<br />You have to read it to believe it!

B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|This game was pretty good. It had some interesting puzzles and HO scenes and was challenging enough to be fun.  The could have left off so much of the instructions during the game to make it more challenging.  Always love the G5 games!  Look forward to more like it.

B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|I honestly have never read any folktales from Africa and, so far, this has proved to be the best children stories I have read.The folktales in this collection are incredibly thrilling.I really admire how King Samuel Benson presents these thrilling tales. Why the tortoise is Bald - Is an amusing story. A very entertaining piece that I enjoyed reading! Why Pigs are Attracted to Refuse Dumps - Is a wonderful, crafty fairy tale with its own subtle moral lesson.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My 3 yr old, he love the movies, they are his favorite movies, he watches one everyday, and I enjoy the movies my self. love it. 5 stars all the way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|To be honest I watched the movie and I expect to find some more details in the book, and I do. Even though the movie was really good with all that cool bluish color  the director use to reflect the story, but the book was something beyond the imagination.<br />I am a great fan of anime, and  there is some thing in common between this an Code Grass, where the empire take ride of the the word and name countries by number, eleven for Japan. The people of the other countries became second class citizens and by the leadership of zero they try to form a rebellion against the empire. The same thing happening in the gladiator movie, when Maximus challenging the empire.<br />Unlike some foolish story about romance and superpowers heroes, there is a big thought and philosophy behind this book.<br />If you like Gladiator, you will like this.

B000OPPSXK|5.0|I first heard Krips conduct when he led the NY Phil in a Beethoven cycle in the summer of the late 1950's. I was hooked but good. The performances were cerebral and emotional. Needless to say, I purchased the LPs on Everest and later the CDs.<br /><br />This led me to explore Krips conducting other great music of the classical period. I bought the later Mozart on LP and was really happy. It was not Szell-Cleveland, but Krips brought out new feeling. Once again, Krips was thoughtful with emotion.<br /><br />When I saw this reissue coupling earlier works on 6 CDs it was a no brainer. Krips proved himself as much a master of Mozart symphonies as the Beethoven conductor I listened to in a week of rapture in Lewison Stadium.<br /><br />If you read this far, BUY THIS SET.

B00D2I8E46|3.0|I have to admit I was stoked about the idea of Elvis collaborating with the Roots, especially when I heard it was going to be musically dark and brooding.  The fundamental problem is I created an unrealistic expectation and sometimes I wonder if I just shouldn't skip reading the hype about upcoming releases as I'd built up \\"Wise Up Ghost\\" to a level I haven't since probably [[ASIN:B000OHZJN2 Blood & Chocolate]], [[ASIN:B000002LGU Spike]], or [[ASIN:B00000AFFF Painted From Memory]].  It's that inevitable failure to meet expectations that sets me up for failure.  And while it's not that \\"Wise Up Ghost\\" is a bad album...it's not...it's just not what I expected.  Costello's forays into different musical genres with various collaborators have been a decidedly mixed bag; sometimes working well and sometimes missing the mark.  After listening to repeated plays of \\"Wise Up Ghost\\" I'm still not sure where to fall on this.  Decidedly it is indeed darker and more brooding, but also at a slower tempo than I had expected.  My expectations were for something more lively and while I love the classic Elvis flourishes: the Hammond Organ, hard funk, solid grooves, and occasionally sharp guitar stabs, so much of what here seems almost sleepy or a groove in search of a deeper meaning or payoff.  Too often Elvis seems to be bordering on mumbling his lyrics as often is the tendency when he drops to his lower vocal register.  Granted I love it when Elvis goes into a lower vocal register as on his masterful [[ASIN:B000OHZJLY Imperial Bedroom]] all too often here it comes off as sleepy and dull.  I kept hoping for harder funk workouts and jams, but nothing here really ever approaches that and it seems Quest Love and the Roots are following Elvis's lead rather than forcing him into realms unexplored over Elvis's long and varied career.  What results is a mildly funked up chillout album, suitable for cocktail parties, soirees, or late at night when you want something not too challenging.  The sad truth is there is nothing here that will challenge your perceptions of either Elvis or the Roots or which shows either shifting their paradigms in any dramatic way.  It's all too pleasant and goes down all too smoothly like aged scotch where I expected some harsh moonshine.sad truth is there is nothing here that will challenge your perceptions of either Elvis or the Roots or which shows either shifting their paradigms in any dramatic way.

0425263991|1.0|I have been a fan of the series since the beginning and was so disappointed  with this book. I had to struggle to finish it. I found the relationship between the main characters lacking. All the big events were chopped down including the revelation of the Ghost. I just could not find anything positive to say about it.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Won't work with a kindle, won't work with a lot of devices.  But they don't mention this in their marketing.  After two hours of trying to download the app, I gave up.  I tried their support page.  No mention of this issue.  I supplied feedback, seeking an answer. I got a page that thanked me for the feedback, but said that couldn't get back to me personally.<br /><br />I am just glad that I learned about their crappy tech support, before we purchased Chromebooks for my office staff.  What a Joke.<br /><br />On a third party website, I learned this doesn't work with kindle or many phones.<br /><br />I found a list of devices that it DOES work on.  So I tried to use my phone.  I had to sign in with my Google account.  But the page flashed a sign in screen, that disappeared within a second.  After numerous attempts, I finally gave up.<br /><br />I had been anticipating the arrival of this device for several weeks.  What a letdown!  I am returning this overhyped product.  And due to the misleading advertising and total lack of support, I will never purchase a piece of Google hardware again.<br /><br />Oh yes, we have a senior blog.  My review will appear in the Sr. tech section weeeeeeeeeee34wshortly!  And this product won't make it into my Amazon store either.  Shame on you Google!

B009UMTMKS|5.0|Excellent amount of information for the newbie. I wish there was a manual like this a few years back. I developed many applications, however I had zero concept on bringing them to the market. One of my problems obviously was thinking I knew what the customer wanted. True, perhaps I had a decent idea on what they wanted but it was not to say, I knew 100% of their requirements. Prof. Blanks book helps you understand this and a zillion more! Like they say, it is never too late so I am reading his book to unlearn what I have learn and start all over again. I will give an update on this site as I venture along my idea...
B003TTH4IU|5.0|One of the best seasons!  Love this show & the cast..wish it was still on prime time television. Must see!

B0002OERI0|4.0|Good Rock and Roll music from Green Day.  Lots of different tunes with clever lyrics and great melodies.  Fun CD.
B00DU77QP2|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It had enough of a plot that I generally wanted to know what would happen next, but not enough to be predictable. While it did end with a bit of a cliffhanger, this wasn't enough to have me dashing back to the Kindle Store to get the next one in the series.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Great season with an introduction of a new character.  Dr. Jackson is in it intermittently and he is missed but we know he will be back!  Love this series

B001LRTT76|5.0|A wonderful adaptation of the novel of the same name.  The film stays close enough to the novel to be a true adaptation but isn't afraid to alter things that work better in a film than a written work.  The plot is a wonderful mixture of an unusual love story and uncovering a conspiracy.  An ending was added to satisfy the people who like things neatly tied up, but this doesn't spoil the overall effect of the movie.  Thoughtful and subtle, yet gripping at times.

B00AEBB8NI|1.0|This is one of the most boring films ever. I watched the 1st 45 minutes and then decided that I had better things to do than waste another hour and a half of my life on it. Cliché upon cliché. Wooden acting from di Caprio and wooden dialogue.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Brilliant writing, stellar acting, original story line, had me quickly addicted.  Finally caught up.  Can't wait for season 5!  Cliff hangar was painfully good.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|guy's I wish that was more demo time. it is stupid it shud be more time but the game is awesome<br />I do not no what to say.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|loved the cd wish had 2 daughter keeps stealing the cd.Not really a fan but love this cd. i  would say get cd here it is cheaper than the stores.
B008I34Y6W|5.0|Out there for years, this album never gets old. My most recent listens, coming with news of George Duke's passing, have me seeing this in a different light. Now, my nephew is heading off to college with a music scholarship in percussion and I realize also, what an exceptional percussion album this is. Never mind FZ's gorgeous live guitar solo embedded into Inca Roads. This album is stellar - fantastically entertaining and technically off the charts.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I actually ended up crying at the end. I thought this was going to be a stupid book about horses but was totally wrong. Well worth reading
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Did not like new one and watched this one afterwards.  Many differences.  Modern music inappropriate.  Not sure why the new one needed to be made.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love it. Love him. Done deal. His voice is just perfect and this is great to get you in the mood for Christmas
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to read books on my phone.  I can carry an infinite library of books with me where ever I go.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|I thought it was slow and boring and an overdone subject.  McConaughey is a really good actor and this was not a story that was well directed.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|The movie was everything we expected!!! My son enjoyed to play with the minifigure. The only thing was it took longer that the other movie to arrived (different vendors) but it was still between the dates they confirm to us, so maybe we were impatient to have it.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|It was full of action and noise and drama and exactly what you would expect from Iron Man.  I enjoyed the escape into the movie
034580709X|1.0|Hello Fellow Readers,<br /><br />After finishing the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy and learning of Stieg Larsson's untimely death, I was anxious to find similar books to fill the vacuum. I read glowing revies of Jo Nesbo's books and have now completed them all.<br /><br />If I had started with The Bat, I would have never picked up another of his books! What a piece of crap! To my taste, Scandinavian noir should take place in Scandinavia. Nesbo's descriptions of Australia make to want to scratch visiting Australia off my bucket list.<br /><br />Harry Hole is a great detective. Jo Nesbo's other Harry Hole books are fantastic. Please skip this one for your own good. It is atrocious.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Passes the time but can be frustrating st times cos you have to build up energy
B004ZH66XO|1.0|This game is not ad free, in fact, it was already free app of the day about a year ago or so, so if I wanted to retrieve this terrible game, I could have just gotten it off of my Amazon app store cloud at any time for free. Get with the program amazon and stop offering apps for free that you have already offered before, especially those apps such as grow that have received terrible reviews, you couldn't pay me to put this game back on my device, so users beware!!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Very good film... action packed. Great effect.  Be surs to watch the avengers... it carries the story on.  Superhero envy.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I bought this for the 5.1 surround sound disc and I am NOT disappointed. The music is clear, crisp and clean. I have the 2001 remaster , I just played them both, it sounds like the 2001 remaster you are listening with cotton in your ears. The surround is subtle not overwhelming more like live in the studio than on a stage except for when the crowd applauses.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|i can't remember the last time i got an album and loved the entire thing.  i LOVE the ENTIRE cd!  everything from the finger work on the guitars to the vocals and the soulful lyrics.  definitely going to buy another one of theirs!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app!!!! It's really good for meditation or if you just want a peaceful silence. I would highly recommend this app to any one.
B005SAJRV0|5.0|big bang theory rocks!  it is always nice to have something great to watch with a teen age daughter. this is it..
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Thanks very much for the quick turnaround for the CR2032 Maxell Lithium Batteries.  Items has advertised . Good deal on the Internet.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|I didn't think it user friendly enough  and I didn't think it made my music sound better either. I uninstalled it j
B0067Q42BY|3.0|This is an OK app. It has good graphics and is easy to operate, however the games don't seem to end and go on and on and on and rarely do you win a game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Very fun and cute! My daughter enjoys it. All the Toca Boca apps are so good. Four more words done
B00AESN8XY|5.0|There are so many copy-cat games out there that I gave up on finding anything really unique any longer. But then I found Plauge Inc. I downloaded it at 10 pm and I am finally putting it down now at 5am.<br /><br />The other reviews are spot on. This game is great.<br /><br />The first thing I want to address is the in-app purchases. Not a single one is required to finish the game. Think of them as &quot;cheat codes&quot;. You can buy them, but they only advance you quicker in the game. To be honest, I bought one of them to try something out. I do not regret it. I have never done an in app purchase before. I think that this game has the only in app system out there that is not totally scammy.<br /><br />Now this game... it is the most elegantly twisted game I have ever played on a mobile device. The goal is to kill the world's population off with infectious disease. Clever.<br /><br />The game takes zero minutes to figure out, and you are totally caught up in it within two minutes. It takes a very ling time to get all of the strategy of the game, but not to play it.<br /><br />No detail was left untouched. There were no flaws, nothing out of place, no strange bugs. It took a lot of effort to make this so perfect I imagine. For something with such a twisted goal, the game is very elegant.<br /><br />And I guarantee that there is nothing out there like this... yet. But even when the rip-off artists show up, I am positive that they wont be able to come close to the quality of this app.
B0000669JL|5.0|Have not stop playing over an over - again which rives my wife nuts  - is the only CD which is a LEGEND!!!!!!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I really enjoy historical fiction. I liked the two sides of the story, Sarah from 1942 and Julia from 2002, it really illustrated how the past impacts is now.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This is the funniest game I have played so far.<br />We have had fun with it. It is not the type of<br />game I would usually play so it was a pleasant<br />surprise that I liked it.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|If you like Dr. Who your should love this.  I found that I cared about the characters and was truly surprised at the ending.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|This was a free app so I thought I would give it a try.<br />It is a fun game to play. It is smooth and easy to use<br />I recommend it if you like tetris type games.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|My wife and I both love Castle.  It generally has just the right amount of mystery and humor to thoroughly enjoyable.  If you like something along the lines of CSI but with some humor thrown in you should love Castle.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Looking a several other cases, this case is a good value and a good price point.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants a nice looking, very functional case to protect there Kindle Fire.
B009LDD54K|5.0|My all time favorite. I do not have HBO so I wait till they come out dvd and spend a weekend watching it.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This CD/DVD combo is awesome! I first discovered these guys on Youtube, and they're really great about sharing their songs there, but owning the actual copy is so much better, and it's also for a really good cause. I listen to the CD quite often, but the DVD is what I love the most. It's moving to see how they combined so many voices and instruments from around the world. I hope they continue with this project and produce more. It's a unique and beautiful addition to my collection, and it also makes a wonderful gift for someone.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I liked it. watch it on a Sunday afternoon on my kindle fire hd with the prime. If you like action this is the movie for you
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|These guys are amazing! I love what they do. I bought their first CD/DVD combo and loved it, so when number 2 arrived, I was wondering if it would be just as good. I'm impressed once again. This set has new songs and features new places and people, and it's just as vibrant as the first. It's another unique and beautiful addition to my collection, and it definitely makes a nice gift for someone. I'm looking forward to a third one!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased this just to test out and see what everyone was talking about, and it's now my device of choice to stream media within my home.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Covered all the loose ends. Will miss Sookie! No huge drama or fight scenes, but good story development. Read it just to find out who she ends up with!
B00AAZSH0U|4.0|Full of onomatopoeia and attractive illustrations of animals communicating with each other finishing with a simple question that connects the reader with the subject.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|One of the best Western Films ever made. Shane has a great story line which exemplifies the solid values of the &#34;Old West&#34;. Shane has an excellent cast with Alan Ladd, Van Hefflin and Gene Arthur. This new Blu-ray is a big improvement over previously released DVD & VHS versions. A must have for any Western movie collector.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|Disappointing in the descriptions of &#34;magic&#34; or other actions. Too easy to figure out the bad guys without bewing told.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game that I can't stop playing it......I love this game so much. Even my kids fight over playing this. Whoever invented this did a wonderful job.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great shoot-em-up movie with a number of good surprises along the way.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|My husband ordered this and he thought it was a book and it was a CD instead.  He watched it and really didn't care for the bad words...him being a minister.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Another body shows up in the back of Merlotte and Sookie is a prime suspect, as the dead body belongs to Arlene - her former friend who tried to kill her. The big question is who is trying to frame Sookie for Arlene's death.<br /><br />Since I enjoyed reading the last book, I was hoping this one had a good pace and a fine mystery to wrap things up. I was wrong. I don't understand how an author has at least two books to finish a long series and ends up with this sloppy idea. Whiny Sookie is back and she acts as a sitting duck while her friends try to help her and get shot/harmed in the process. Not to mention the motives behind the crimes and the criminals were poorly chosen. I was happy some older characters were back until they were totally dismissed and disappeared into thin air. I really mean disappear, we don't know anything about them again. I guess most of the wrap up will happen in [[ASIN:0425269515 After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse]], which is appalling since that information belongs in the last book of this the series, and not in a short story.<br /><br />I understood who Sookie was going to end up with in the first books when Harris said she would not become a vampire. But the author made a bad choice when she didn't steer the story towards that end. It doesn't agree with the other books, and to that end Harris had to hastily erase Eric's personality - he so didn't deserve this ending. Why bring more holes into the story with this unconvincing plot? To think I was relieved the fae were gone and then read this... I know most people don't care about details, but if you say something is impossible you should stick to it. Or at least make characters behave in a coherent way. And most importantly, where did all the fun go? I don't know if the author is sad, but the tone of the books changed a lot and I missed the good laughs and funny situations, which was one of the main reasons I kept reading. I'm not happy about the holes, weird twists and a lot of hasty sentences thrown in to try and explain the holes, but I used to love this series. Even though this is the last, I would recommend everyone to read this series up to book 9. You'll be happier that way.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved this game just wish there was more room I hate to stop playing but I have escaped :( and did it in 3day
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Great family movie. Iam always looking for movies that I can watch with my 9 year old son and this was fun and age appropriate.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book had a lot going. And keeps you drawn in. I'm interested to see if the movie is just as good.
B00E687MWQ|5.0|Satyricon shows that they have much more up their sleeves than you may think.  There are many layers to Frost and Satyr to unwrap.  Detractors, keep in mind that Satyr mentioned countless times that this new record would be different from anything they've done before.  If you're expecting Nemesis Divina II or a follow-up to Rebel Extravaganza, you're going to be gravely disappointed.  But let's face it, those albums have been done already - and they're classics.  Appreciate them for what they are.  In its own unique way, this record will be up there with the Satyricon classics, but the listener has to be willing to be challenged.  In many respects, Satyricon's songs's are variations among a theme, and this doesn't change on the current record.  There is theme here, not of anger, as with previous records, but of melancholy, thought on culture today, and sadness.  The music on this record is a reflection of Norway's culture, which is filled with sadness and deep contemplation as of late.  Yet, at the same time, there is the inkling of a rebirth - as in the track \\"Phoenix.\\"  While many have criticized this record on a cursory level, the reality is that one or two listens will not do the record justice.  Frost's drumming is there - it's just not as \\"in your face\\" as it has been in the past.  Frost is giving you something, then taking it away - just at the right time - then giving it to you again.  He's not dishing everything out all at once.  You have to listen beneath the surface.  In this respect, you can feel his passion and the ebb and flow of the battery, meshed in harmony with Satyr's guitar and vocals.  For many who are expecting the disharmony present in past records - beware - this is a new endeavor for Satyricon and for black metal in general, but look at it as a new iteration in a continuous evolution.  The cold days of 1990-1995 are behind us.  Relish what those years gave us, but also understand that Norway is changing and the changes in the Norwegian environment and culture are reflected in this record.  In that respect this record perfectly captures a moment in a time, which is what great records do.  When you give these tracks a chance to take you over and understand that Satyricon are not living in the past (and they shouldn't have to) you come to realize that power and majesty of what they've come to create.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|There were parts of this story that were a bit over my head medically speaking but most of the time I could not put it down.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Long but worth it. Classic, open-eyed look at war, with the brotherhood of the earlier German military professionalism swallowed by Nazi idiocy.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|Another great sigma novel mixing science and excitement. The sigma series makes you want to keep following its characters from one adventure to the next.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. Everyone should read it!! It was perfect for my own children as well as my students as a read aloud.
0316201561|5.0|I would recommend this book to all ages and not just children. It is witty, clever and had me looking at the old tales in a whole new light.  Such intelligence, satire and fun rolled into one book by Chris Colfer  is amazing.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Nylund is a master of his craft, and this novel is a prime example. Definitely a must read for any fan of the series looking for back story. Nylund has yet to dissapoint me with his expansions on the Halo universe
0316232955|5.0|The maturity in the story writing of this book is totally amazing. Where was a book like this when I was a teenager? As a 59 year old woman I felt so much empathy with Carson Phillips and his trials and tribulations during high school. Such insight and sarcastic whit is very refreshing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't know why this show is so good, but it is! It should be boring as all hell, but the characters are so captivating and when the writers keep killing people off, you really don't know who's going to make it to the next season. Also, the accents are great.
0316201545|5.0|Even though I thoroughly enjoyed &#34;The Wishing Spell&#34; and raved about it, this latest book cost me hours of sleep. I simply could not put it down. It was clever, bordering on sarcastic wit and a joy to read!  And yes I cried at the end - quite a lot. As a 59 year old I found this series enlightening and much fun.  How does Chris Colfer do it!!!!!!!!?????
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This series started out great but steady went more down hill with each new book. I was expecting much more as the first book was excellent.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|What can I say, I love this show. It's the only one I even bother to watch &#34;live&#34; every week, never missed an episode. Heck, for 3 1/2 years I set my class schedules around the show when I was in college.<br /><br />The actors are great, the story-lines are (mostly) great, the guest/recurring actors are great... It's going into Season 9, fairly good chance of a 10th. Here's hoping they hit their 200th episode!!!<br /><br />Package came in perfect condition, no damage to the cover, 100% pleased with my purchase.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have a kindle fire HD and have no problems running this game. I have played magic since the late 90s and this got me right up to speed!!!
B002G1YPH0|3.0|top right vents are messed up. it's bent down though i think it's not a problem. I fixed it myself but i don't want to see my components messed up like this. a 3-star rating for amazon.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Very fun game. Sometimes it's hard to get some cards when u have a lot. That's why I don't give it all stars.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I bought this for my five year old, which she loved it. I have to admit, it's definitely not a bad movie. We have watched it many times and it doesn't get old. The girls love this one!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It's a decent game could improve on the time it takes to do things like create charms or dif things along that if they improve that 5 stars
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I had read Stone Cold as my intro to Baldacci's style, so the opening was familiar to me. I am now several books in to his series of both the Camel Club and King & Maxwell. I find it slow going in the beginning of a new series to familiarize myself with the characters and keep them in their 'place', but when the book gets moving, I have trouble putting in down. Sometimes there is too much 'filler' description, but I gloss over that to get to the meat of the story. I am sucked in to the characters and, as in life, am disappointed to find my favorites are sometimes not as great as I had hoped.<br />I am mentally 'on the edge of my seat' during the greater part of the book and keep reading until I am certain the character is out of harm's way. I am always disappointed when I come to the end, and I have the characters in my head for days afterwards. Can't wait to get to the next story, but sometimes have to defer to my other familial responsibilities.<br />Traveling soon, so I'll be loading my Kindle with numerous books to save on the weight limit from the airlines.<br />So far I am as happy with David Baldacci as I am with Michael Connelly and Sue Grafton.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I love Dan Brown's writing so I was really looking forward to this book. It kept me guessing. Not my favorite but still a good read.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|After watching World War Z, I tried to understand why so many people panned it. I couldn't see it. The production is first rate. There are many great tense and scary scenes. The cast is very good. The story is epic and given a proper landscape with some truly dazzling and memorable moments.<br /><br />My only criticism of this film is that it ended somewhat abruptly. Thus the half star taken off.<br /><br />But maybe this is a zombie film for people who usually don't like zombie films. I don't. I liked one zombie film before this one and that was Zombieland. And while that was a more tongue firmly planted in cheek type of film, this one is serious and very realistic.<br /><br />In a year filled with surprising films that I did not expect to like, this one is the newest addition to that list.<br /><br />Richard Roeper said it best. This film is entertaining as hell.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I jumped into this book with high hopes based on all the 5 star reviews.  I can't imagine anyone giving this 5 stars. I'm giving it 2, because the writing is decent enough for me to want to finish the book. Right now I am about 75% through it. I almost stopped reading it after the first 3 chapters because the introduction to so many characters in such an awkward way was confusing. Then I was like \\"OK- who is Lucy again?\\" and had to go back and see. The plot is completely predictable, and felt like the \\"mystery\\" had been over less than halfway through the book. After the author revels what you've already been thinking is going to happen, you're left wondering what could the rest of the book possibly be about since the mystery is already solved for you.  I'm looking forward to getting to the end of this one so I can move on to something else. I sure hope the ending has a little bit of surprise to it and doesn't disappoint. Otherwise I might log back in and give this one 1 star.
B00A27X972|3.0|I saw this book mentioned on a few blogs and the premise of an alien coming to earth in someone else's body sounded interesting.  In the book a professor solves the Riemann hypothesis, a mathematical problem which apparently would advance technology too quickly.  An alien species whose whole planet revolves around math determines that humans aren't ready for such advances and comes to Earth to destroy the evidence, which includes killing people.<br /><br />An unnamed alien returns in the professor's body and has to get used to life on Earth. This seemed a bit unrealistic to me because he kept making references to how advanced his society was, yet he didn't understand dynamics of life on Earth or even know the language.<br /><br />I didn't like some parts of the book where the aliens make themselves out to be so much better than humans, having more knowledge and more advanced technology.  The alien kept referring to humans as primitive and went on and on about how disgusting they looked, how weird their noses were, how their skin felt, how repulsive they looked, etc. So far I haven't found a book that introduces an alien species that doesn't somehow put down humans and life on Earth.<br /><br />So this book wasn't my favorite for that reason.  However I did like how the alien got to know the people and began understanding the positive parts of being human.  He came from a planet where everything was done logically with no emotion involved so I guess it was a nice change to be part of a family, even if it wasn't exactly real.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed parts of this book and it was short and entertaining enough to keep reading despite the drawbacks.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Don't read the book blurb or anything about this book before you actually read it. There is a surprise on page 79 of the hardback that is best left unknown until you actually read the book. The book is a bit strange, but I really enjoyed it. Don't want to give anything away.<br />Rene
B00DAXYNEI|4.0|Just getting started on season one of this series. I love Kevin Spacey and this role seems to suit him.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I would have rated this higher but I couldn't find directions on how to move the MInion.  Haven't played any other endlessly running games.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|my 10 year old granddaughter bought it on my kindle, she plays it when she's over and seems to enjoy it
B0087ITBPC|5.0|This is a super funny and sweet story.  Watched it with my adult son which made it even better!  Highly recommend
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|lots of action, 'believable' story line, some great looking cars, love ruled the main characters and once  again the good transformers rock!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have enjoyed the three seasons I have watched, and I am looking forward to the new season on HBO.  I liked having the digital copy included so I could share with my friends who don't have Blue-ray.<br /><br />Norma Whitacre
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It will hold your interest until the very last page.  Very thought provoking.  It will make you think about karma and how the smallest decision can change everything.
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|I've admitted elsewhere on amazon that my preferences for tenor voice run towards darker &#34;masculine&#34;, so to speak, voices, rather than boyish falsetto-tinged ones, all the vocal acrobatics of the latter notwithstanding. Ever since Giacomo Lauri-Volpi (or maybe even Caruso, though it's hard to tell from those early recordings), the lower-voiced tenors, or shall we just say darker-timbred tenors, gained prominence and strong following.  So while not to take anything away from bright shimmering voices, like of the late great Luciano Pavarotti or current sensation Juan-Diego Florez, my own collection has practically everything Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras, Giuseppe DiStefano, Giacomo Aragall, Rolando Villazon, and a few others committed to record, maybe with an exception of Jonas Kaufmann, whose vocal mannerisms for me personally detract too much from the actual voice on practically every piece aside from Wagner's arias. (Fans of JK, please hold the rotten tomatoes).<br /><br />Placido Domingo dominated the opera stage for pretty much the last quarter of the 20th century as the grand tenore of our time.  All individual preferences aside, Domingo's contribution to the world of opera cannot be understated. He sang, recorded, and acted on stage more roles than anyone. He broke Caruso's record of Met's opening-nights back in 1999.  At one point he probably realized that there's literally nothing left written in tenor clef that he hasn't tackled.  He established a solid 2nd career as a conductor.  And now he tackles a 3rd - this time roles written for a baritone.  It's fairly well-known that Domingo had his start as a baritone, following the footsteps of his father, a well-known zarzuela baritone.  But it was quickly apparent that his voice is a unique tenor instrument - a dark sound, to be sure, without an Italianate squillo, but with resonant burnished bronze ring to it.  While not as huge or piercing as Vickers', it was still a large, lush sound, and it was more easily captured by recordings, and his extremely likeable personality coupled with commanding and handsome stage presence only added in his ascend to the very top of tenor world.<br /><br />Domingo's voice aged remarkably little over the years, so I don't think he &#34;switched&#34; to a baritone because he somehow &#34;could not do the tenor&#34; anymore.  That's rubbish.  I think his switch was brought about by his genuine desire to explore some of the finest music that he still hasn't sung.  In addition, he is first and foremost a singing actor.  Singing ardent 20 year-olds (the parts usually reserved for tenors) long became a little uneasy for Domingo, who is in his early 70's.  Verdi wrote amazing melodies for father and ruler figures.  Germont-pere, Simon Boccanegra, Rigoletto... I could only imagine how irresistibly attractive these roles are to any singer.  I honestly cannot blame Domingo for trying them on, even if he doesn't succeed 100% as a baritone.  Thanks primarily to baritone greats, such as Titta Ruffo, Leonard Warren, and Ettore Bastianini, we've come to expect this voice to be huge, resonant, and very dark.  Look up any of these singers reaching amazing depths of Rigoletto's anguish or Iago's cunning.  That still sends shivers down my spine.  But we tend to forget that there were great lighter-voiced baritones, who brought unusual and welcome nuances to these roles.  Names like Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Pavel Lisitsian, Giuseppe DeLuca, Gerard Souzay, Thomas Hampson come to mind.  Not to get too technical, but Verdi baritone has a range of F#2 to B4 or C5 (!), and that top is where Domingo really shines, as expected.  One necessary quality that is a must for Verdi is a bit of steel, or bite in a baritone's voice.  Uber-metallic Matteo Manuguerra was a perfect example of that.  In Domingo's case, his voice's dark-bronze ring that he emphasizes quite prominently on this recording serves as a fine substitute.  Where the score calls for a deep resonant note, he either hits it without lingering on it or finds a way around it with an emotion, sometimes even inserting a tiny gasp for added effect.  Where he doesn't succeed fully as a stentorian baritone, he makes up for it with beautifully sang legatos and amazing phrasing.  I kept thinking this is how someone like Gerard Souzay would sound had he tried Verdi. The interpretations are exciting and captivating.<br /><br />Another thing is that this CD really benefits from a second (or third) listen.  That's because at first listen, you can't help but look for the voice that's become so familiar over the years, it's hard to get it out of your head.  That's very distracting.  So, once your ears become accustomed to Domingo's &#34;second voice&#34;, which is essentially the familiar ringing center with an added resonance in the lower register (I'm sure that was a feat to accomplish!) and get past the memories of great baritones singing these familiar pieces, it will become infinitely rewarding.  Out of my respect for everything Domingo does, I cannot take away a single star. Sony's sound engineering is a bit &#34;boxy&#34; at times, making me wonder where it was recorded, but overall it's very good.  I would definitely recommend watching Domingo act Rigoletto or Simon Boccanegra prior to listening to this CD.  Thankfully, these performances are captured very well on DVD.its it without lingering on it or finds a way around it with an emotion, sometimes even inserting a tiny gasp for added effect.  Where he doesn't succeed fully as a stentorian baritone, he makes up for it with beautifully sang legatos and amazing phrasing.  I kept thinking this is how someone like Gerard Souzay would sound had he tried Verdi. The interpretations are exciting and captivating.

B005DJREGQ|4.0|Great show with believable characters. Definitely hits on the awkwardness of being in high school. Funny without loosing moments of real weight.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was so sad when this book ended- it was a page turner from start to finish.  Unusual story, great characters, I highly recommend reading this book!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I just love super hero's, and Jack Reacher is one. I have loved every one of the books in this series. I am now reading my fourteenth of the sixteen books available. The background behind each story is very interesting, and well researched, and most everyone will have lived in areas where Jack Reacher travels, as he moves around quite a lot. This English author makes you feel like Leon Uris is back with an Americanized version of James Bond, only with a very different personality. You can't  help but wonder what has happened to Jodie, and if they will ever meet again. And always at some point you think that age will make him want to settle somewhere. Didn't the detective in New York offer him a job as a consultant or something.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I loved the show! I can' t wait for the new season to start. It is such an exciting show!..
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|An Excellent mystery. Just love the main character of this series. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a lot of action, and a well thought out adventure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subwaysurfers because it is challenging and you get different stuff and you don't know when it is happening so you have to get this awesome game
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The acting is very good, and the story is very entertaining. I love the whole premise of the show and enjoy stories about that era and place. I do not appreciate the homosexual inclusion and think it represents what is going on in our society today but is not representative of society back then. It is offensive to me.I also don't like how thomas keeps being about to leave and then coming back with a better situation. It seems silly. I also don't appreciate how all of the best characters are being killed off.I certainly hope there's not a love affair with a married man. I would like to see higher morals and values in this show.
B00021HBGS|4.0|We bought these for our almost 4 year old. So fun! They stick to the bathtub walls easily and are great for playing in the water. The only issue is we wish there were more signs and even people in the set. Great buy! Great gift!
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright are brilliant. This movie is one of my favourites, and one I keep on-hand to watch repeatedly.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Tedeschi - Trucks (two of the best musicians of our lifetime) never disappoint. The fact that Mike Mattison is a background vocalist says enough.
0060589280|4.0|Don't shy away from this novel just because the topic of sex can be taboo.  Or because the main character is a prostitute.  It is not an overtly graphic depiction of Maria's sexual encounters.  Coelho deftly turns Maria's experience into a reflection on what it is to love and how coupling is a manifestation of joining souls.<br /><br />Convinced she will never find true love, Maria leaves her homeland of Brazil for Geneva, Switzerland to seek opportunity.  When her quest for fame and fortune ends, she determines that the best way to make money is to sell her body.  She justifies her choices in a philosophic way.  She doesn't even enjoy sex!  But when she meets a painter who intrigues her, she is forced to reconsider the ideas of love and loss, pain and pleasure.  Sure, there are some erotic scenes, but nothing too scandalous.  It is Coelho's skill at exploring something so fundamental that makes this novel approachable.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My 2 year old loves this show: he can watch repeatedly.  I think the absence of dialog is a strength.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|As much as I am addicted to this game every time there is an update it starts freezing up and going hay wire
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Well-written and suspenseful, this novel is a real cliff-hanger.  The relationships are realistic and interesting.  I highly recommend this page-turner.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is such an easy read. I love when an  author paints a picture with words. I want to be able to see in my mind what is happening in the book. Ms. Goodwin, did just that. I learned so much about Lincoln and his &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; I have admired her for ever so long as a brilliant historian. Big thumbs up for this book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So much fun I couldn't put it down. I got to level 9 in less then 56 minutes!<br />So exciting !!!!!!!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This may sound odd, but at my age I am just discovering music that was popular when I was in my teens and twenties.  Our home had OLD music so I was not exposed much to the popular stuff.  I have heard folks talk down Fleetwood Mac, but I really like listening to them.
B001P7HUF0|5.0|The best line was in the end. It goes something like this: \\"There is a line every lawyer crosses accidentally in every case. If you cross it enough times that line disappears and you become a lawyer joke.\\" That was a good reminder for me because I am about to become an attorney in a few months. I want to always practice with integrity.
B001TCHDPS|3.0|I saw this movie and purchased both CDs, more to support the artist than because I truly loved the music.  The songs all sounded very much alike and it got boring.  Gave both to Goodwill for someone else to enjoy.
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|I thought that the movie was okay but  the fact is that this movie just has too much fake gore. Overall I would say that the movie is fun to much. The one thing is that it's pretty scary but they should have used real blood instead of all this fake blood.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun with this game.. I can't put it down for long!! Best game ever!! Fun for the whole family too.
0783235380|4.0|Sandra Bullock is one of our favorites! this was a must have to add to our movie collection.. not a bad price either
B004ZH66XO|4.0|Well amazon you have been getting shadier lately. I love the faotd idea but now you are just wasting people's time!<br /><br />As far as the app is actually concerned my son has loved it since the first time it was the faotd.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love it.  It's the best show ever. Be prepared for lots of blood!  There are some very funny parts too.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Typical j R full of twists and action does tend to go into to much detail on some topics here and there
B00E8TVHBA|3.0|My 6 year old daughter and her friends love this movie. Plenty of fun songs and dancing that will have your daughter imitating while watching.
B0031RAOVY|2.0|When I saw Richard Gere smiling and a beautiful dog I was very excited.  However, after Richard's character passed away it was extremely agonizing.  I may have tears run down during movies, but I outright bawled & bawled & bawled.  Having to watch that dog hunger for his master was heartbreaking.  I know it was based on a true story & I remember reading about it in the news, but I believe it was carried too far and the film could have ended sooner.  The amount of years the dog yearned could have been displayed in the narrative at the end rather than subjecting animal lovers to the agony of Hachi's devotion.  Not recommended for any age.
0783110871|5.0|full of suspense and action about a killer boards a jet and goes wild on a killing spree.  i loved this movie.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Everyone in my book club loved the story.  We thought it was very well written, and especially loved the connection to flowers.
B008XG1X18|3.0|normally there are just a few minor glitches or lag time. but for the past week it wont load on my kindle fire
B008BM9L72|5.0|Once you start to read about Christian and Ana it will obsess you<br /> and take over a part of you forever.
B003NX76BM|3.0|I enjoyed the book, as usual for Nora Roberts, the book was very well written. I enjoyed the plot and the storyline immensely. I did not like the characters Fiona and Sam. For some reason they were not my favorite characters so I found it very hard to get through the whole book without stopping several times. Sam seemed to be too much of \\"rough around the edges\\" and Fiona was predictable and tiresome. Overall, the plot was very good and I enjoyed reading it, I just like the characters.
B00F35BV64|4.0|They did a good job of staying true to many points of the story while still making it easily absorb-able for those who just started the series with the new reboot. Still a great cast.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Both my wife and I enjoyed this a lot. Great acting and an unusual story with a different twist for an ending. Definitely worth watching. The kids are great actors!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Great epic fiction, as such it does take a while to get through but the pay off is definitely worth it.
0061351342|5.0|...for my Spanish speaking friend.<br /><br />The book is beautifully made, a keepsake for any Alchemist fan. Will purchase for myself [even though I don't speak/read Spanish] just to have in my collection. :)
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Definitely deserves the praise it is receiving, good book to sit down and go through. Enjoyed it quite a great deal.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Fantastical, amusing, hysterical, witty series -- love all the 80's references! Here's to a phenomenal cast, well-written scripts and a barrel of laughs. ;-]
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Really great movie, not your standard rom com at all. Nice story, great casting, and the awards and nominations it received are well deserved.
B00005MP58|5.0|Fantastic series -- a MUST watch, a MUST have if you're a Pride and Prejudice fan. Acting is great -- very detailed and follows the book quite well. And did I mention Colin Firth? [swoon] :)!!
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Enjoyed the show so much, wanted something to remember it by.  This will be a great keepsake.  It is sturdy, comes with money bag not shown in picture.
0062024329|5.0|Collecting as many versions of the novel and this is a great, colorful.. fantastically illustrated version! Enjoy it -- always a great gift idea for the artist and any Coelho fan! =]
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|This is not my favorite Susan Boyle album partly because I'm not a fan of show tunes or Donny Osmond. I love all the songs here but feel like there's nothing new brought to any of these songs. Somewhere Over the Rainbow sounds like a bad Eva Cassidy cover which is a real shame because Susan has an incredible voice but the song lacks originality. I also think that Donny Osmond is way out of his league here, he seems to hold Susan back. I do like Michael Crawford and feel like he adds something positive and new to Susan's sound. I think the first half of the album is by far the best with the second half falling flat in comparison. There is no douth that this lady has some voice and songs like Memory, Bring Him Home and Send in the Clowns yet again confrim that.
0061122416|5.0|Coelho, thank you! Great, simple story line. Brings you back down to Earth as a human and what's truly important in this world. May we all continue to follow our path--and find our treasure. 'Maktub, thought the boy.' =]
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So addicting.<br /><br />I love to play this game.A Must have game.black dogs are cute. Are you loving tis game. Have fun.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This book picks up right where the last one left off. I am just addicted to all of these YA books and such an interesting story line. After seeing the City of Bones movie and then reading the book and then diving straight into this one makes the characters more real and believable for me. I can see all of their faces in my head and I just love that! What a great book, so many things happened and I know it's not over yet! :)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I loved this game. It was fun and easy to play. All my family enjoyed it. Best game<br />to have.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|This is the beginning an epic sifi journey in the history of the mankind. Great for entire family. I want a sequel.
B003L5BRXK|5.0|probably the best  album the rollings stones ever did, this has rock blues, country pop rolled up all in one.
0553801473|5.0|I really don't understand all of the negative reviews of this novel. It is great! I have about a hundred pages left and I'm slowing down because I don't want it to end. (Especially knowing that \\"The Winds Of Winter\\" is not likely to come out until 2015.) The characters are so fascinating and the writing so detailed I savor every sentence. \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" is a tie with \\"A Storm Of Swords\\" for best novel in the series, in my humble opinion. If you are a fan of the other books you WILL love this one as well. Enjoy!
B00499NHLC|4.0|Great story lines and actors. I highly recommend this well thought out who dunnit series.  Try it, you will like it.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|I had heard this movie is where Channing and his wife meet.  Wanted to see his first movie, He has improved.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I loved it as much as my kids. Highly recommended, family fun! You will not regret watching this one. I recommend popcorn.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This was a fantastic movie but, as always, not as good as the book in my opinion.  Now it was no Harry Potter 4 fiasco when it comes to trueness in relation to the book- not much was skipped over at all but some of the characters acted a bit differently than they were portrayed in the novel.  I would recommend watching this without thinking about the book if you have read it.  Not to say that this movie is only for people who have read the books because it is even better to those who have not!  Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic Actress, Oscar Winner, and all-around great woman who did a superb job in this film.  I enjoyed this movie even more the second time and third, so on and so forth.  It is one of those movies that is quite interesting to watch what is happening in the background because the costumes and settings are so thrilling!  The directing/camera work was done well and I would recommend this to anyone and everyone that likes a bit gory, slightly romcom, serious tale of a heroine showing drive to save her family.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Just good rock and roll. The Black Keys are classic rock sounding, but with a modern twist. I highly recommend this CD.
B008476HBM|5.0|I'll admit, in my 20 years I never had read this book but only watched the movie about 100 times and know all the lines from start to finish so I finally cracked it open (via the kindle application) and was blown away.  This book is so excellent that I cannot put it down!  If I did not have classes to go to it would be done in a day, hands down.  I cannot believe my teacher in high school said that it was boring,dry, and hard to understand therefore we should just watch the movie- oh how wrong she was!  Yes, some of the words may be a bit hard to those of a younger audience and even some older.  This is why google was created!!  On the kindle/app you can even hover over a word and it looks it up for you right then and there!  The book is only a bit different from the movie, obviously written far before the film was made, but just in case all that you have seen is the movie do not fret- it does not ruin the book!  The film is sometimes line for line the same as the novel.  This is obviously a classic that has been read and reviewed for years and years but if you have never read it- stop everything and read it now!  It has become my favorite book of all time, but I have yet to read Jane Eyre so this could change!  Another great novel by Jane Austin- Brava!!
B003AO1SVS|4.0|I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes good rock and roll. The Black Keys managed to capture a classic rock sound with many modern elements. Bravo!
B00915G6MG|5.0|its just great to watch and the dry humor is fun. we always watch after wii time golf or bowl.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its great I like it its so creative u can build anything I mean anything it makes me laugh if u play this like me u are awesome all of my friends play it so I m awesome
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am hooked!! The whole series is an excellent read. Certainly keeps you turning pages anticipating what happens next!! At times I thought there was too much detail in that the author would add what clothes were on the characters or subtle body movements and such but other than that the books are all well written.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|More of that good old day's stuff, love to hear the back ground noise from the all time out door listing group, all of us hippy central people
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|It was slow going from the start, which isn't always a bad thing. Once the plot got rolling it was fine, but then the entire supporting cast began to yap behind closed doors about the terrorists and what, if, how why and when. It went on and on. This also became incredibly absured and laughable at the end. I think they gave up any sense of realism at this point. Roland Emmerich is turning into the new Andy Sidaris. Even Independence Day was grounded in reality.
B00AEFYWDC|5.0|This is Ed Norton's breakout movie and he knocked it out of the park.  Richard Gere, Frances McDormand, and Laura Linney are equally as good, but Norton steals the show. And maybe the best ending ever.  Love this movie.
B0045DO8LK|5.0|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.

B0019IIPXQ|5.0|I think it was great SCI Fi with power hero.  Vin Diesel is the hero and gets everyone to do what he set out to accomplish in the first place.  A+ - great entertain - a must watch.
B001ECQ6PG|5.0|This quality of this player is great considering how inexpensive it is. It works great plugged into the wall or on batteries if you want to listen to a few records on the go. It's lightweight and stylish.  The tone arm is actually lighter than other non adjustable tone arms i've seen which means your records are being damaged by playing them on this. Only real complaint is that the volume does not go loud enough, which is understandable considering the size of the player. The sleek look is aesthetically pleasing and overall the product is very nice; there are three settings for record speeds which is considerate when taking into account some people still have 78's they want to play. you can change the sound quality by adjusting a few nobs on the bottom which is amazing on a portable player.  Overall a great buy.
B007SGM084|5.0|Let me preface my review by saying I have read this Trilogy at least five times. I think E L James is one of the most talented writers of our time. Her books are addictive, in that you can't put them down. There have been many criticisms of the content of these books, but if u read them with an open mind, you will understand how they are critical to the story. The first book tells the story of Christian Grey, a self made 27 year old self made millionaire. He is cold, calculating and very kinky. His background and earlier years have made him that way. He meets the young and naive Anastasia Steele and feels drawn to her. He doesn't know why. But he pursues her and finds that she is different and he likes that. She has a sassy mouth and he finds that annoying but no one has ever really talked back to him. Book Two is about his pursuit of Ana and meld into one and marry. There are parts about his submissives and other tanglements. The story grows.She loves him for himself not his money and he can't understand it. The Third Book is the best by far. It has many revelations that will make the reader understand Ana and Christian to the fullest. It has a great ending. Learning to love and trust leads to the happiest of endings. I greatly recommend these books. I absolutely love them and will probably go back to them many more times. E L James has written the screenplay for the first book. Hang on for a good ride.
0307341550|5.0|Great , love it and could't stop reading definitely would refer to friends, this book is a hit!!  Love the writer and read three of her books.
0140386335|4.0|Bastian is a small boy who has some big problems.  He is bullied, picked on, his Mom recently died, and his Dad never seems to care.  When he hides in a bookstore to escape a morning of bullying he finds himself stealing a book that he has never read because it looks interesting.  Soon he is in hiding in the school's attic reading a book that transports him away from all his troubles...literally.  He is reading about a land that is full of dreams, dragons, giants rock men, other monsters, and much magic.  Will the lands empress be able to survive her illness that has her on deaths door?  Bastian soon discovers he has more control over that outcome than he could ever imagine.  Can Bastian help this fantasy land stay strong and survive?<br /><br />This is a book like no other.  It is full of fun fantasy, great fantasy characters, and lots of action.  I think it became a classic because it was the first of it's kind.  A book about a boy reading a book that comes to life for him, so much like the book itself the readers are reading.  It was a a whole new spin on action and fantasy.  The characters were fun to \\"meet\\" and picture in my head and I came to like them very much.  I also enjoyed the plot and the concept behind the whole book.  It was a pretty good read.  Surprisingly, I had never read this book before now nor had I ever seen the movie based on this book.  At times I was a bit lost or had a hard time following some things, but found it was okay once I continued reading on a bit.  Some of the book was a bit slow moving too, I felt it could have moved at a bit quicker pace than it did.  I can't say as it will be in my list of favorite classic books, but it was a really good and interesting read none the less.  I would recommend it.<br /><br />4/5 Stars
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Game play is quick and slightly challenging. Logic for challenges makes sense. Load screens are a bit slow. Overall game is entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Read as much as I could stand then gave up. I am a senior citizen if that makes a difference?
B002G1K82Q|2.0|I have seen this movie before because my older sister owns it. Which is why I question why it has no color? When my sister's did? It got delivered right away. I would just have preferred to actually get a real version of it.
B0018M6J90|5.0|My best friend made me watch this at her house and afterward I just knew I had to get it for my mom. She's a big fan of the war time era. Funny, sweet, very enjoyable film!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was what I consider fluff or chic lit and not something I usually read.  I'm so glad I read it though. It is great. One of the best books of the year.  I didn't want to put it down and the fluff turned to substance.  It's memorable.  I can't forget the characters and hated to see it end.  The author did an awesome job with developing the plot and the characters.  I loved it and would highly recommend it.  I can't wait to read another by this author.
B008D36INE|1.0|This was no where near what I had expected to see in a movie. It was horribly done and long with no closure. Do not waste your time.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book was very readable, just forgettable.  I was hoping for something more magical.  I wanted to care for the characters more and the plot didn't grab me.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I loved watching the journey she has been on through her career and that her earlier work is also mentioned in the film. She is a great person and humble artist who appreciates her fans so much they can feel it.
B002G1YPH0|1.0|If you already have a computer built and you dont want to completely disassemble your computer and rip out the motherboard to install this fan, then this fan is not for you. Because that is what you have to do to install it.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Had no idea I would like this as much as I did.<br />It's shot well, edited to keep your attention and has a pretty interesting slant on the price of fame from someone who seems to know that price but it still glad to have the opportunity to pay it.<br /><br />Katy is fascinating in that she really is talented, gorgeous and has a personality that really shines. I always had issues with some of her multiple songs about glamourizing sexual experimentation and binge drinking, but it makes more sense where she's coming from after watching.  And even though the blue hair and need for attention and to please might be annoying, I have a feeling that Russell Brand missed out on someone WAY out of his league.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This does everything Google said it would do.  It took less then five minutes to set up and as the HDMI and USB ports are on the back of my TV it's completely invisible.  I purchased it primarily to watch NetFlix and Youtube on the TV rather then using my PS3 Fatboy.  The Fatboy is getting long in the tooth and the cooling fan for it generates enough noise to be distracting.  Now everything is quiet.  Being able to use the tablet or phone to pause, backup, or fast forward the video works as stated ... very cool.  The only thing that keeps me from giving the Chromecast five stars is that I can't stream my home video's from my phone or any other video for that matter to the device.  I can only see things getting better as developers start enabling this device on their apps however.  So I expect that in the near future I will be able stream personal content to the Chromecast and watch on my big screen tv.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I watched this because a friend insisted.  Episode by episode, I enjoyed it but I feared the series would, like The X-Files and Lost, have a million lose ends forever.  But this one ties things up nicely, pretty much at the end of each season (with the door open for another season).  I didn't like the final season - it was a complete departure from the entire rest of the series and, if you have to start your final season with Star Wars type on the screen, explaining what happened up until now . . . I mean, really?  But all in all, it was a very smart, engaging show, and the actors were just outstanding:  every single one of them.  I could't even begin to pick a favorite character, because the actors did such a superb job with their roles.  Great series.  Likable to a vast audience.  Very highly recommended.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This gets you back up in no time! Works perfectly! This is a great USB cable in every sense of the word.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Fits original Kindle. Love design and feel of the case. Looks a little book. Stands at any angle from about 45 degrees to completely vertical.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Thank you for this great app.  We will use this alarm on a daily basis.  Between school and work this app will be great.

0385737955|4.0|So, two of my kids are absolutely mad about Dylan O'brien who plays Stiles on the popular TV series TeenWolf. Without any hesitation it was brought to my attention that he would be playing the lead in the upcoming movie version of The Maze Runner. Naturally, that translated to read-the-book-so-we-can-see-it-together! I jumped at the opportunity and now I can share it with you!<br /><br />First off, let me say that I love books that have characters strategically shrouded in mystery. When Thomas, Dylan O'brien's character, wakes up delivered to the Glade he has no memory except for his name. Immediately we are pulled into the story - intrigued and wanting to find out more. What the heck are a group of teenage boys doing raising themselves in a glade anyway? Dasner does a superb job of convincing us that what these boys are going through is very real.<br /><br />The story is filled with a terrific balance of action, mystery and terrifying moments. You will definitely not be bored by this narrative. A word of caution, there are some graphic moments of violence so if you, or your child are sensitive you might want to preview beforehand.<br /><br />My only gripe with this fantastic novel is the level of dark. I found myself wondering if everything in the story continues to delve so deeply into despair why would these kids have the gumption to go on? and would I if I were in their shoes? It would be nice if we at least had a glimmer of hope for the future of these well written characters.<br /><br />All in All, I give The Maze Runner a 4.5, hats off to James Dashner!
034580404X|5.0|These books were recommended by a friend or two so I decided to read them. I am not usually into women writers, but these were fairly well written by E.L. James. No surprises, they have a lot of sexual situations in them, but also a very good love story if you like these types of books. Don't just read the first one, Fifty Shades of Grey, you have to read all three to get the entire story. Also Amazon had the best deal on the trilogy I have ever found. They are quite explanatory in the sexual part, so if you don't care to read this type of literature, it isn't for you. It is the amazing story of a college girl who gets quite the education on sex itself for her very first time. Was quite disappointed at the end of the first book is why I say you must read all three. The story continues in the second and third book so read the trilogy if you decide to read these books, and buy from Amazon for a very reasonable price.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I really appreciated the humor and humanity that the main character demonstrates in his thoughts and dialogs with other characters.  The plot was intriguing and the end was a big surprise--well worth reading!  I look forward to reading more Walt Longmire Mysteries.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I stuffed some crumpled newspaper on the bottom then layered charcoal on top.  The fire lit and heated up quickly.  It saved so much time and frustration.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Haven't received it yet but saw it on TV. This is a very good movie and would recommend it to everyone
B004O2AZHI|3.0|Unfortunately when buying this I didn't realize that it was a different region and so I haven't been able to watch it. But that is my fault.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|It's not too long but it's a fun play. There are more games out there that will give you more value for your $0.99 but it's just $0.99 we're talking about. You probably have twice that much in the crack between your car seat and the center console. It's different from most puzzle games you've seen so even though it's not very long it's worth the money. Try it out.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I like that you can put a password on it and you can have many norebooks.<br />Its a great app.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game!!  The colors and sounds as well as being able to win sometimes!!  It's wonderful and I would share this game with anyone!!  It didn't crash or cause any problems!!  Thank you for the larger amounts of fun!!!
B000AJIF4E|1.0|These are decent sounding headphones but I can't believe they are getting so high rating, especially for their lousy durability. These are the worst design I've ever owned as far as durability. They look great and sound pretty good, but after 6 months, the foam pads on the ears come off very easily and are difficult to put back on, and get more and more difficult over time. Also, bits of foam padding cracks and peels off and sticks to your skin. I'm really let down by these headphones and now have to spend more money to get a good set.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I want to like this book, I really do.  I spent a couple of good days with it...letting it keep me from doing things that really needed to get done and significantly decreasing precious sleeping time.  Those couple of days were enjoyable, even fun.  I may have highly recommended this book to a friend at one point given the opportunity.  However, now that I've finished, I'm feeling like I totally wasted my time.  I would have had to call said friend and said, &#34;I'm sorry...you may want to stop reading now.&#34;  A lot of unnecessary information that I thought would come together never did.  A lot of ridiculousness got thrown in at the end.  In fairness I enjoyed most of it...but the end just left me feeling, well, &#34;HUH??&#34;  It didn't leave me wanting more...it left me wanting less.
B003VW54QO|4.0|Between this movie and El Dorado, you get the enjoyable John Wayne formula western. Not that that's a bad thing, because I think you're watching it just for that reason. Action, humor, drama, and this one has a little music too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|addicting....  my 4yr old and I love to play<br /> this game both together and separately!  games is fast paced and exciting.
B004LQGXPA|4.0|Loved George C Scott here. Movie is great, but my only critique was the Germans (in the movie) using 1960's US tanks, vehicles etc with the Iron Cross painted on the side. Yeah, production costs and all that. Note also, if you ever see pics of Patton, I think George C. Is about a foot taller and Patton has a much higher pitched voice. Still, a awesome movie to watch. Patton was the right man for the right time and had he a little more political finesse, Europe might have had a different map during the Cold War and in our favor.
B00F2362IE|5.0|My first impressions of the gameplay were pretty lackluster, because it's difficult to get the hang of. After a dozen or so runs, though, I'm getting hooked. Very fun game.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Beautifully acted, written and directed. Gripping and heartbreaking, a true achievement of drama that draws you deeper and deeper dowm the rabbit hole.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I tried an entire day to transfer my voice memos from my iPhone to my iPad but for some reason iTunes wouldn't do it. When I thought all was lost, I sent the memos to DropBox and in less than 15 seconds, I was listening to my memos from the iPad!!!<br />I also was able to use and edit all my Microsoft Office material from my PC on my iPad using dropBox. Log in from any computer to work on your files and reports. This App is a time saver and a life saver. This is a must have App!!!!
B00DGKVW9Y|5.0|Excellent product very great sound and handles all my hdtracks and flac files.  Built in amps pumps clean bass to my headphones
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app works great - offers the more complex calculator.<br />I just needed it for simple calculations. Fits my needs perfectly!
0316247545|5.0|A very nice guide to the series. I enjoyed the input from the creators and writers. I thought the episode summaries were perfunctory and would have benefited from highlights, references, revealed for the first time etc. The Guidebook to the Simpsons does a better job of that. I learned that the Serpent's name is Steven Magnet ... priceless. The quality of the book is excellent, thick cover, high gloss paper and beautiful illustrations.
1442419814|4.0|:I liked it because it made him read, instead of playing video games all summer long plus he was tested on returning to high school<br />this September. thanks for having this book on hand.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie, would watch it again anytime. I love it when the end is not the same old chick flicks cliche. No harsh language or violece or sex scenes. An amazing movie and can be watched with children around no problem at least comparing with all the other movies made lately.
B000001F9N|5.0|A must for every Donna Summer fan. Don't miss out on this great recording. Donna was truly amazing as a music trailblazer for her time.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I love it it is a really nice book and I want to read more best book I've read in a while
B003U4UOP4|5.0|I loved Lost.  I thought the writers did a great job bringing the whole story together and I was really sad when it ended.
B00BIPKROU|4.0|I never had any intention of watching this show until I was bored one day and decided to just give it a try. I was hooked from episode 1. Julianna Margolies really is a good actor. My preconceptions of what this show was about and what her character was were totally wrong. I also enjoy Archie Panjabi and Matt Czuchry. The host of supporting actors is usually very entertaining, specifically Carrie Preston and Martha Plimpton - who have both won Emmy Awards for their perfomances on this show. Also enjoy Mamie Gummer's perfomances.  They could've found a better actor to play Will Gardner. Josh Charles is about as entertaining or interesting to watch as a cardboard box. All in all this is a good show to watch.
B00D2MC8WG|5.0|Gustavo Dudamel continues to impress audiences around the globe. This is about the time that naysayers begin to nitpick his performances but the fact that he is an intensely musical conductor is never in question. In these three Strauss works, well known to everyone who loves classical music, he stands before the mighty Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and in a live performance offers exemplary Strauss. He has become a force of major importance in the conducting world.<br /><br />Dudamel at first favored the big sound when he began his tenure here in Los Angeles as conductor of the LA Phil, electing to program works with a splashy element to them - and certainly all three of these Strauss works fall into that category. But as he ages musically (he is still only 32 years old) he seems to concentrate more on architectural detail, inner communication between choirs in the orchestra, more finesse to the gentler moments, more allowing the transforming moments of slow quiet moments hover in the air.<br /><br />And while Dudamel keeps his audience satisfied with the big works such as these on this well balanced well recorded CD, he is also maintaining his commitment to new music and to the 'old music' - for three seasons he is including the Mozart da Ponte Trilogy in fully staged exceptionally well paced and sung performances. He grows and matures in the best way imaginable. Grady Harp, September 13
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I wouldn't say I loved though.  I definitely would read it again if I had it to do over.  I wasn't sure what to think of the odd and disturbing twist(that I saw coming but hoped she wouldn't) that came at the end.  It was very frustrating ending but I have to give it to her it made me want more to see how it would all end up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If this TV show is not the best TV show I've ever seen, I don't know what could possible surpass it.  Don't miss watching Downton Abbey.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Felt like I was reading the same book over again.  Clary and Jace going back and forth trying to stay away from each except this time its for a different reason than in the first book.  I have read the first 3 books and so far this is my least favorite BUT you have to read it to understand whats going on in the 3rd one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|found the novel easy to read and somewhat suspenseful. There are a few twists and turns to the plot which keep you interested. The ending was not what I expected. The only negative is that the book is a bit too wordy - for lack of a better phrase, and sometimes that lulls you and breaks your concentration
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan. This however fell short of my expectations. Despite the enticing subject matter, it was for the most part boring and lacked the real excitement I was looking for. To be fair though, the trip back to Derry and meeting up with some characters from 'It&#34; was pretty cool.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Very thought provoking book.  Parts of it I had to read over to understand.  I thought that Frankl's ideas were sound and the book was an excellent read.
B00BRH2MN8|3.0|A couple good songs but others are a bit thin. Good bargain. Interested to see what her upcoming debut album has to offer. Hoping for more depth.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I am enjoying this game. Most of the objects are fairly easy to find, others? well it takes time or use the hint button.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would give this series 6 stars.  I can't wait for season four to come out.  Love it so much.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I cannot get this app to work on my android phone, it freezes but it works really great on my kindle.no problems at all.
B005544V6A|5.0|I needed to watch something entertaining and funny....this movie was just what I needed to get my mind off of college studies for a while..
B001NLL93W|5.0|Although I wish that the series had more to it because it's such a good read that I wish it never ended :)
B000VECAC6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, a great cutting satire that skewers blind followers of dogma, incompetence of authorities, and of course, the Romans.  It has all of the familiar Monty Python elements while holding together as a narrative better than any of their other films.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all, essential to Monty Python fans.  However, buy the most recent versions, since earlier digital transfers suffered from mediocre video and sometimes undecipherable audio.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|i loved the underhanded sci fi nature of this movie- it's got some pretty heavy philosophical undertones that stuck with me long after i first saw this film- always happy to rewatch it
0740748475|5.0|These came perfectly wrapped in plastic and ready to be gifted. Nowhere else could I find a complete set for this price!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great AP to use on my Kindle Fire HD. I always have to check my math because I have a learning disability that was diagnosed late in my life. No matter how I do it, I want to check my answers. Well this program couldn't be any easier to use! I always have my Kindle within reach because I use it that much. It is so great to not have to get up and look for my calculator. It is one less thing I have to keep track of in my busy home. The AP is clear and easy for me to read even if I can't find my glasses. It is definitely a favorite of mine.
B00001NTXN|5.0|This game can be played with 2-4 players and also has some wiggle room in the rules. An excellent strategy game
B00957T6X6|4.0|LONG BOOK, READ ONE AND YOU ARE HOOKED.<br />BETTER THAN THE TV SHOW AND THAT IS REALLY SAYING A LOT BECAUSE I LOVE HBO'S GAME OF THRONES.<br />JUST SO MUCH MORE IS UNDERSTOOD WHEN READING THE BOOKS.
B00821OX98|4.0|Like this series. Aliens invade Earth and humans try to fight them. Doesn't drag out. Pretty good graphics. Not a bad series at all.
1878424505|5.0|great book. will read over and over again. the book is very practical with lots of great exercises. i recommend to all.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like this series. She has spunk. Wish my husband enjoyed shows like this...I feel like I have to use the treadmill just to be alone to watch!! Good for the hips. Pretty good series!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swiftkey is magic app. It prompts my typing word efficiently. I love it and surely recommend app to use everyday.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is a great movie!  It is fun and entertaining.  I I am looking forward to Reds2 coming to DVD so I can get that one too.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|One of my favorite books of the year!  So disappointed when it ended!!  With her easy, straightforward style, Rowell lets us into the head and heart of this college freshman.  We live all of her angst, insecurity, fear and humor.  Great insight into the fanfiction phenomenon and how we readers can become completely immersed in the worlds and characters created by great storytellers.  Highly recommended.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|you need to look at it before tackling it.  also sometimes the pieces do not move when you touch them.  can be frustrating also even though is aalso satisfying!
B00CQW9TR0|3.0|This one put me to sleep during the first 20 minutes or so,I expected a super job from Ed Harris -he just did a walk through-not his best work at all....David D. as a Russian intel,politico was a bad joke -any I'm not laughing. Whoever casted this movie should go back to the couch...
B00F91G5BS|5.0|Great Effects,  Edge of the seat Action....  Nice twist on Zombies.  Good Solid Sci Fi.  Even my wife loved it and she hates Scif Fi!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Excellent movie! Action movies are always better in the theaters than they are at home however, this movie transitioned beautifully from the big screen to the small screen. We (ages 17-57) love this movie!
B00DHRLK84|2.0|I bought it mainly for the 3D version and was disappointed. The 3D effects were ok at best but poor compared to others. I'm not a walking dead fan so all I can say is it was OK.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Quality at a good price. Delivery was on time. Liked this product,very pleased with it. fantastic,great movie,Recommended<br />to others,Great for collection
B009WUBERW|4.0|This is by no means a cinematic masterpiece, it is the sequel to a movie that pokes fun at all of the over the top action flicks of the 80's-90's. However, if you want to turn off your brain for an hour and enjoy a movie, you can't really go wrong with Expendables 2.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Weber's second Honor Harrington novel showcases yet again his flair for the drama of &#34;space opera&#34; and the exhilaration that comes from a play well acted, if only in our minds.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|I felt this movie could have gone three ways, super violent &#34;300 style&#34; battle movie, epic fantasy movie &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; esque or Disney style kids movie. Any of these choices would have been fine, but for some reason the director decided to do all 3, so you end up getting this hodge podge movie that really stretches attempting to appeal to all audiences. It's a decent movie, but mediocre at best on its delivery.
0812932293|1.0|I got past the smell to read a few pages and did not enjoy the writing.  Overall, the book stank.
B0059DQHHI|3.0|Predictable once the characters were established. Fat rich guy lording over his wife's ex lover cum biological father of her firstborn. Something biblical in the story line.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book is a quick read but a bit predictable.  If you want a book that is a little fun but doesn't need much thought, this is it.
0786939532|5.0|For someone who has not read in quite some time and has little to zil knowledge of the Forgotten Realms as a whole, this book was excellent.<br /><br />If you like fantasy or science fiction, read it. Period.<br /><br />In Homeland:<br />-Women are superior<br />-Backstabbing is divine<br />-The surface and the sun are evil
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved the book....couldn't get enough!  I hope there's another series along these lines...lived vicariously thru Ana...definitely a good read...would recommend it
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|For the first time someone verbalized what I had not about &#34;god&#34;!! That it fit how I feel, I know I was guided to read this book for a reason! I'm on my own spiritual journey at the moment and its one more resource for me to share and learn and reaffirm my own goals!! Very easy to read and the experiments are fun. I like the idea at the end for creating a &#34;group&#34; to keep the focus on positive things and creating the lives we all deserve!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I did not like The Casual Vacancy. I found it vulgar and depressing. There was little hope for any of the characters, who were selfish and mean. The rampant use of the f-word lowered my liking of the book. One good point of the book is that unseen ramifications of what someone posts on the Internet is evidenced.  I did read the whole book and was disappointed in how it ends. I do have several friends who started it and did not like it, and, therefore, never finished it. I am interested in viewing the murder-detective mystery that Rowling has also written, but if it is anything like the Casual Vacancy, i will not be interested in anything else she writes.
0141195851|5.0|I bought this for a personal &#34;library&#34; that I'm building and like the fact that each of the different books has a unique cover that compliments others in the line.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is a great application for those who are Star Wars and/or Angry Birds fans. The colors and graphics looks great and the music is awesome. The game plays smoothly on my Kindle Fire without any crashing, and while it's easy to learn to play, it still has plenty of tough challenges through out the levels.<br /><br />While playing the game, the higher you score the more things (including characters) you unlock along the way. So while you're playing different levels, you can switch out which Angry Birds you want to use for each move, letting you take advantage of each characters special Star Wars Angry Birds powers. Also the game gives you the option for joining the \\"Pork Side\\", where you play as the evil pigs and try and hit the Angry Birds. Just like the birds, there are several types of evil pigs and each has their own special moves.<br /><br />You can also teleport your [[ASIN:B00E1XSSQK Angry Birds Star Wars Telepods Jedi Vs. Sith Multi-Pack]] characters right into the game (purchased separately). Using the little teleporter that comes with them, you put the action figure into it and using your tablet/mobile device, scan them with the camera and they download/teleport into your Star Wars Angry Birds II game. Basically scanning them unlocks the characters in the game so you can play them.<br /><br />This game is lots of fun and the graphics have come such a long way over the past few years. While the game is designed to have the same great game play as the previous versions of Angry Birds, there are also several new fun additions to the game that make it new and entertaining.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Very well  written, directed and acted.  I'm looking forward to Season 2.  Love the strong woman characters and the no holds bar.

B002KGEORM|5.0|Amazed out how well Katey Sagal plays her part as Gemma.  So much confidence and conviction.  Someone I wouldn't want to mess with.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Good way to learn the game!  I'm sure that you can get many hours of enjoyment out of this game.
1579125549|5.0|Simple, easy to follow, allowing broadening of own mind as regards angles of play and use of pieces in combination.<br />.Drawback is very little guidance via the written word, but may not be needed..
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Having never watched the show on television, I am really enjoying it commercial free on my Kindle Fire when I am too tired to read anymore
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Very fun and very challenging as u go on . Kids love it . Would recommend to everyone . It makes u think harder when its really simple (:
B0057RCFQS|5.0|my granddaughter is just getting into dinosaurs so i got this series for her to watch. we've only watched the first one so far as i believe she is a bit young to really understand the stories yet. but she loved the dinosaurs and enjoyed the suspense.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game! I'm addicted and play it whenever I have free time :) definitely recommend it. It's also great for my 7 year old daughter.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|my husband loves this little tool. very handy and easy to use. uses it to sharpen his tools as he's working.
B000S88JTS|5.0|While the material is a bit dated, this is still a lot of fun to watch.  It's great to see footage of Malcolm Smith, Steve McQueen and the AMA Pro racers.  These guys are amazing given the equipment they had back in the day - it really makes me appreciate the motorcycles we have today!
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This game greedy spider is a fun game to play you have to basically swipe web to break spiders path so that the insect can be saved but gets harder ( I'm not many levels up ) two spiders on web and you got to try block both from getting the insects
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|This game is a wonderful addition to our preschoolers favorite games!  She loves it because it is bright, colorful and engaging.  It keeps her wanting to go back and play more.  It also is wonderful for me because she is learning, and doesn't even know it.  I love the child-like characters and the bright colors.  It is adorable and we really enjoy it!
0452273331|5.0|The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged were read many years.  I ordered them for a smart young man who is entering his freshman year in college.  He read them and said &#34;this is what the country could be again.&#34;  We can only hope!  I recommend both to anyone who believes in capitalism, freedom of choice and getting the government, and their nanny state, out of our lifes!
B005MLOKXA|4.0|A kind of McGuyver for legal dirty tricks. Except McGuyver is a mrried woman with kids and has a lot of help from co-workers and political figures including her jailbird former district attorney husband.
0345525558|1.0|I never such tripe in my life, no way it could happen!  Do not buy it and certainly do not read it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|It keeps my son's tablet from getting slowed down. He can easily get his applications closed on his very own.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book was very well written. I couldn't put it down. I really hope Ms. Grissom writes a sequel to this book.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|The pieces are not \\"Tetris\\" shaped. They are randomly cut from the grid, and they don't seem to really get more difficult. You can alter the size of the grid, number of pieces, etc. but you will often see large oddly-shaped pieces which are obviously only going to fit in the puzzle in a certain way, and the rest just falls together quickly. Little challenge, but you will find one or two that take a bit of thinking.<br /><br />Also, the pieces don't rotate. They are where they are, which again makes for a predictable puzzle.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the main characters, and enjoyed their interactions with each other. After finishing the book, there is no way to not consider how you would have handled this disturbing situation. Loving, and being loved, can make life a mixture of moments of happiness and sadness, and heart wrenching decisions. I felt the same emotions as the novel &#34;Tuesdays With Morrie&#34;...draining and worth the hours of reading.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I have several ones like these. The Gerber one has a much better design than the letherman and is lighter, blades are a bit smallish for my taste but it can take a beating.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My review:<br /><br />It sets up easily (only positive)<br />Videos cast from my laptop were choppy, at best.<br />I cannot cast from Chrome in iOS.  This was the feature I assumed would be available but it is not.<br />Only YouTube and Netflix played decently...but I already have a PS3 so I don't really need this.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I first bought the camera without the LCD thinking that I would be able to monitor everything from my iphone through the GoPro app, but the app disconnects once you start recording which makes this LCD a must. Problem is that it consumes the battery much faster than without it on. And in sunlight it's a bit harder to see the LCD which makes it a bit useless in certain situations especially under water.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love, love, love Nicholas Sparks.  Unexpected ending with a big shock.  Great writing.  Can't wait for his next wonderful book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was all the rage in school. I picked it up and started reading it. I couldn't put it down! Such a beautiful story and I can't wait for the movie! Definitely recommend this...to everyone!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|At first it sets up a unrealistic charachtor role which develops into more.  the basis and thoughts behind it draw you in.
6305718954|5.0|I consider Stigmata to be one of the best written and expertly casted films in recent years. Tom Lazarus reached down and came up with a wonderful concept and then fleshed it out with targeted research. All cast members performed their roles commendably and presented a believable, though fictional, presentation of a well crafted screenplay. Even as a card-carrying atheist, I highly recommend this movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another great book b Nicholas Sparks i think its one of my favorites. Twist in the end i didnt see coming at all
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game in some of the rooms you really need to think about what your next move is.  I recommend this game for anyone who loves to use the brain power.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't believe I took so long to read it. I thought since I seen the tv movie that I didn't have to read the book. I was wrong. The book is so much better.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I just spent three frustrating hours trying to connect the Chromecast device to my router. I discovered that Chromecast does not work with my Netgear 600 router. I will send it back tomorrow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a very fun game. I love that u put in the age of the person playing and it tailors the game to that age. Plus it's so much fun
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I wanted to like this device. I really did. So many people are buying it. But nearly as many are returning it because it really offers little or no advantage to anyone who has a smart TV. The device is very limited in what it can do, and setting it up the first time can be frustrating.<br /><br />It only works with the Chrome browser. You must download a software plug-in to your Chrome browser for this to work. It isn't easy to set up the connection between your tablet device and the Chromecast dongle if you're trying to use an Apple based tablet or phone. Once set up, however, you can broadcast whatever you see on your Chrome browser onto your TV screen.<br /><br />There are two ways this Chromecast device gets the internet video into your TV. Right now, it is optimized only for importing videos from Youtube, Amazon or Netflix. For these three services, the Chromecast dongle pulls the video from the internet source and not from your handheld phone or tablet device. You use your tablet device only as the video controller, not the video source. In this mode, the video transmission works OK. But again, most new TVs and DVD players can already do this without a Chromecast device.<br /><br />While Chromecasting should be a cool function, it does not always work smoothly. For videos from sources other than Youtube, Amazon or Netflix, the Chromecast simply transmits the signal from your tablet device to the Chromecast using your Wi-Fi connection. Because this uses an additional chunk of your Wi-Fi bandwidth, the video frame rate slows down the video frame rate so much that the images stutter and skip. And that's using a high speed cable network of 20 MPS. I can't even imagine trying this on 2 MPS DSL or a 5 MPS phone company based internet connection.<br /><br />Besides using it for Youtube, Amazon or Netflix, for all other videos the Chromecast device becomes nothing more than a wireless substitute for the HDMI cable you would otherwise need connected between your tablet device and your TV. In most cases, you'll have much smoother video using the HDMI cable instead of the Chromecast device. The cable is easier, faster, cheaper and it works as good as your tablet can receive the video.<br /><br />I wanted to like Chromecast, but its complications and limitations at this time do not seem to make the viewing experience any better than what a Smart TV can offer on its own. Perhaps the future will bring more Chromecast functions with less limitations and greater ease of use.device and your TV.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|The devil is in details. It's exactly this respect for details that makes this book feels so authentic and gripping. There're nearly 100 \\"references\\" that explains something that may not actually exist but it just drags you right into the horrible world that the author creates. This is really a war that occurs on a worldwide scale, with each coutry facing its own situations. It also covers all walks of life, from civilians, soldiers, pilots, priests and many other professions. The war was carried out in cities, in the wild, underwater and even in the space. What more could you ask? This is simply the first time a Zombie story tries to achieve something so ambitious. The only limiation is the character building. The books takes the interview format from a wide range of people who survived the war. The stories are personal and authentic, but the variety of them also weakens the establishment of characters.
1620404869|4.0|As a lover of most things Austen, this has been on my to read list for a while, and on my physical shelf for a little while.  I wish I would have picked this up sooner!  This review might be a little all over the place because 1} I both listen to this book on CD and read it when I had the time/hands free from little D, and 2} that's kind of just how my brain works right now with so little sleep and no caffeine.<br /><br />Jane Hayes is a loveable, relatable character, possibly because I too fell in love with Colin Firth's portrayal of the beloved Mr Darcy.  {Yes, I had the 6 VHS tape set from years ago, as well as the DVDs.  Mine, however, are not hidden in a house plant.}  Her trip to \\"Austenland\\" is probably something almost any Austen fan would love, and it sounds as wonderful and surreal to the reader as it does to Jane when she gets there.  Three weeks of living in Pembrook Park?  Yes, please!  After a while, though, we begin to see how uneventful it really can be living in the Regency-era.  Sitting around all day waiting for people to call on you?  Not being able to just take a stroll with your gentleman friends?  Stitching all. day. long.  {Don't get me wrong, I love reading and cross stitching.  A lot.  I just don't think I would want to do it day in and day out!}  The Regency era can quickly lose its Austen-lovers in the dullness of the every day.<br /><br />The author, however, does a good job at engaging her readers.  While the Regency era may not be as high-paced and glamorous as we think it is with reading some of Austen's works and watching their movie adaptations, a modern woman living the Regency-era life is very interesting.  Especially when we get to read her thoughts on different aspects of it!  And the story slightly mirrors some favorite Austen works, which makes me like it even more.  Like a lot of Austen's works, Jane {and the reader} is introduced to a few different gentlemen, all of whom are looked at as \\"potential suitors\\" for Jane's stay at Pembrook Park.<br /><br />I really don't want to give too much away, as this was a great read and I don't want to spoil it for anyone.  So, go to your local library/book store and pick up a copy of Austenland.  And tell me what you think of it!t Pembrook Park.<br /><br />I really don't want to give too much away, as this was a great read and I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|Although it's expensive, I absolutely love it!!! Best case I've ever had! If you're an avid music player like I am, the only downfall is that the audio is a little fuzzy if the charger door isn't open and the music is too loud.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I love this show! There are so many plot twists and the dialog is fantastic. The sceneryIis gorgeous, too. Cannot wait for Season 4!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|This and always will be the number one show with me...the start of everything that is a show,LOVE this dhow
B00DNDR29I|5.0|It is very rare to hear a complete CD in thought and concept, The Electric Lady does that from start to finish. The album cannot and should not be defined by a specific genre just take it for face value as and artistic masterpiece..
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  The plot pushed the bounds of credibility.  The characters, though interesting, were never developed.<br /><br />Strong on stage magic, low on movie magic.
1416972242|4.0|This item cam in a good amountof time. I ordered it for my niece but now I will be reading it.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|great for finding out the signal strength of the wifi in your immediate area. I found it useful when I was out at the local coffee house and other places.
1416594795|5.0|Dawkins is an outstanding writer and makes evolutionary biology exciting to anybody with an open mind.  His arguments are compelling, and his sense of humor is refreshing.  I've read Dawkins' books and listened to some from audible.com.  Either way, he's sensational.
B009GIPDQS|3.0|I was looking forward to this read but it disappointed. We know Grisham is capable of masterminding clever and convincing plots but this story lacked conviction and credibility to me.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|similar to ALL DAN BROWN , SUSPENSE, HISTORICAL INFO, GOOD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, FELT THE SAME . DO NOT LIKE WORD LIMITS ON THIS REVIEW SUBMISSIONWITH INFERNO
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wanted to be able to watch netflix in our bedroom without hooking up a gaming device, a blu-ray player or a getting a new TV. This $35 worked great. Set up was easy Picture and sound look great. Worked with both of our smart phones and Kindle Fire. I even heard they will add more pictures. Netflix and YouTube apps worked great. Even was surprised to see some google music apps could work as well. Unfortunately the music apps (only the google apps were available) only worked if streaming music. If they add Pandora or another free streaming app it would have been perfect.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I thought it was better than the first. Although they say the bad guy is Khan it doesn't seem to be the real Khan. I thought that Khan was at least part Klingon.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|JUst gets better and better every year...scenes/quotes from this movie come to mind all year long...hahaha!  Everyone who was involved in making this film seemed like they were having a great time...
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|I love the game and its a stress reliever, but I have trouble keeping it up and running. It shuts itself off on my Kindle with the clock running!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|We can not get enough of this wonderful series! Love all the characters and the twists and turns of the plots!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Fast paced and easy to follow you can see the landscape even though I have not seen the movie yet.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|This is out second time watching all seasons of &#34;Dexter&#34;.
B00AQA0OJG|5.0|This statue is utterly gorgeous. I can't even tell you how much I love it. It's one of the best in my collection.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love this book!  If you need any more proof of Heaven, just read this one.  Amazing!  I will read it again!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Its very easy to use and is fast too. I love the app store as its got so many to choose from.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|My husband LOVES this movie. I like it. The plot gets a little ridic but if u can suspend ur disbelief u will enjoy the movie. It's a little Catch Me If You Can so that's a good reference point.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is still a good way to keep up with Friends but it is getting to commercial. Not like it used to be, too many changes.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this expressly for the purpose of listening to my 20k google play songs through my living room tv. It works and it doesn't.<br /><br />The good:<br />  1. Set up was extremely simple. I had no connection problems at all.<br />  2. It is inexpensive.<br /><br />The bad:<br />  1. It works (sort of) through my phone, a Galaxy S4. However, sound quality is intermittently poor. Sometimes it sounds like a Victrola circa 1920, with several popcorn poppers providing ambiance.<br />  2. On random play, it will fairly often stall for unknown reasons.<br />  3. Even though it does not stream from the phone, I detect a moderate battery hit, probably because of constant polling.<br />  4. Using my laptop, when I \\"tab cast\\" google.play.music, I get video of the web page, but NO SOUND. No setting changes on either the tv or the computer made any difference, nor changing hdmi slots. I had no problem with video or sound on, for example, a youtube video, but google's own music player (the one you would think had been tested to death) is mute.<br /><br />Maybe these problems will be resolved with software updates, but for now this is of marginal utility.
B00821OX98|5.0|This series is not only exciting, but it draws you into the characters as well. We are currently watching Season 3 (pay-per-view) with equal intensity. Recently saw part of an interview with some of the main characters and I am glad to know that their will be a Season 4 launched in the summer of 2014. In the meantime, we ration ourselves to just one episode daily so we don't run out too quickly!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great Sci Fi movie , it kept my attention the whole way through .  Who doesn't like Jennifer Lawerence !  She is hot , and a great actor too .  A+  Can't wait for part 2 .
B0012GMY64|5.0|I saw him on stage when he was 84 in Branson, Missouri.  I wanted this to remind me of that memorable evening.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|This is a kind of static Tetris, so if you love that classic, you will certainly love this one. You can change the number of pieces of the puzzles, as well as the dimension of the puzzle itself.
1594203334|5.0|I'd read this and bought this copy for a gift for a new mom.  She's loving it so far. Lots of great ideas.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I really liked this movie and actually clicked on it because of Maggie Smith (Hogwarts witch extraordinaire  :)<br />Not five stars due to a bit too much profanity for me and the one gentleman not acting like one and peeing in any bush or on any tree,  but it was wonderful to see a movie about those of the golden era still living it and teaching it to the younger.  Wonderful actors and great script.  I would see again~
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|, but These books are written for young adults but I found the story intriguing. The plot for this post-nuclear war story was very interesting. As a long time science fiction reader, I enjoy books that have unique views on popular themes.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In typical JG style this book is a page turner. The main character is in prison for racketeering and is really a pawn. But he is smart enough to get himself out and save himself as well as his acquaintances. It takes many twists and turns that you don't see coming, just when you think you've figured it out. Up to the last page, it's not tiring but intriguing. Would recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries and John Grisham!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|enjoyed the premise of the series a lot and the writing style too - lots of great characters and an interesting read
B007SGLZP8|5.0|WELCOME BACK JOHN GRISHAM !! I have been a GRISHAM fan from the start,captivated by him ever since I read his first book A Time To Kill. One of my all time favourites was The Partner and this book reminds me of The Partner. The way he can weave a tale and leave you guessing how it is all going to work out in the end is amazing. I find myself asking in the middle of this book, why would he do that, it doesn't make sense, but all questions were answered in the end. I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My kid loves it. My wife and I love it. It's a nice, safe, cute show. It's nice not having a show you know is safe for your kid to watch. Since there are no words in the show, there's no chance of bad language.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Loved this movie! This was a very good movie, non cliche.  Unique spin on the old Hansel and Gretel tale.
1557420580|4.0|When I ordered this book, instead of just getting a kindle version or anything else my friends suggested, I knew I wanted the feel of the real thing. When it arrived at my house, I was so happy at the classic look, feel, and smell of the book. I enjoy the idea that it has history beyond each page. The used rating of the book was spot on. It isn't used with highlights or marks, just read previously and enjoyed. Now It's my turn.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Very nice CD. Lindsey Stirling is a great artist. This CD has catchy and upbeat music. Can't wait for her next one.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|As usual this apt works like a charm.  What else can we expect from the all too familar Adobe Reader.
B003204MQS|2.0|I kept hearing about the movie and decided to watch it, was not anything like I expected.  Who ever wrote this movie has never had problems themselves with a 'ghost.' It was easy to predict.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Revenge is by far my favorite show on tv today!! Emily VanCamp is simply amazing as Emily Thorne! Ready for season 3!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I would recommend this book for daily food to the soul. I have it in Kindle and it really is a great read and guide for me.
B004EF65QA|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. Thank you for having it on prime. I like the country side and the period of time the story takes place.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|This film is classic, a return to the early days of Los Angeles before the Dodgers and freeways in the interwar era.  The remaking of the roaring 20s milieu is well done with autos, phones, cigarette cases and spiffy clothes. How Nicholson' s suits stay so well pressed was my only question, especially in a hot dry summer. Chinatown is woven throughout the film in off handed remarks only to become the scene of the climatic conclusion, where, indeed, anything can happen, but it is more like the Japanese classic black and white film, The Bad Sleep Well, for indeed, it is the power of water resource control that triumphs over elementary human decency in this film.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Poor HD quality, crappy movie.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  This movie was lacking in plot believability character development and energy.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game look like a game that will keep u active im really getting this game i cant wait till i get this game so excited
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I really love this movie.  The ending was sad but I STILL LOVE THE MOVIE. The actors were gra too.  I would  recommend this movie for everyone.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Persuasion is old fashioned and rather slow moving movie.  I liked the actors and definitely appreciated the subtitles.  I would not recommend it for young people as they would probably consider it too slow.  But it is a relaxing feature and with a satisfying ending.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Great time killer and brain exerciser.  Price is most definitely right and download is a breeze.  Besides, it is fun!
B009GFEOY8|3.0|I really thought I'd like this.  I was around when the original Polaroid cameras were popular.  I remember taking the &#34;instant&#34; pics and watching them develop.  Of course I was in grade school at the time so I had no sense of cost, and don't remember if they were cheap or pricey to use.<br /><br />I got a One-Step from a friend of mine, camera looks like it was used once or twice and put on a shelf.  And since the battery is in the film pack, there's no old-battery issues, if it looks good, it might still work.  Bought a pack of Impossible film to try out in it.  Man, things are NOT like the &#34;good, old&#34; days.  20+ minutes to develop, and a really mixed quality to the prints.  And 8 shots per pack, weren't the original's 10 shots?  So  yeah, for $3 per shot, I expected more.  Much more.<br /><br />From what I've been reading, the quality of the film is slowly improving, the early stuff was really bad, and now it's at least consistent.  Hopefully they'll get it right before the retro-Polaroid fad dies out.  But for me, I bought my one, and only $24 pack of film.  They no longer take the old packs back to recycle, so I'll just include it with my camera auction on eBay with a couple of the better shots to prove it works.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Great time killer and brain exerciser.  Price is most definitely right and download is a breeze.  Besides, it is fun!
B00499NHLC|5.0|No, it is not just the allure of the accent. The writing, acting, and directing in this series are remarkably good. Benedict Cumberbatch (I do hope that is his birth name), is a quirky, brilliant Sherlock. Martin Freeman, as Watson, however, is my favorite character. His responses Sherlock's idiosyncratic behavior are priceless. The are modern day twists on the original stories, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, are clever and excellently conceived. I am almost finished with Season 2, and anxiously awaiting the start of Season 3. .
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Not being a literary critic, I'm not going to attempt to tell you about how great the sentence structure was or give any of the analysis you read from more sophisticated critics. All I can tell you is that from page one I wanted to know each character and have them in my life.  It was a treat to open my kindle every night to see what happened \\"while I was gone.\\"  They tugged at my heart...made me laugh....and even made me shed a tear or two.  I will say that the ending was just a bit too abrupt and it was signaled a little too soon. I was so enjoying the characters that I was have enjoyed just one more chapter.  Anyway....none of this stopped me from ordering McKenna's next book so if you decide to give this book a read, I hope you enjoy.
B008Y7IP0S|3.0|In a fit of nostalgia, I decided to rent this movie. Having never seen it before, I was well aware of the basic plot. It was enjoyable, but dated.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so fun I'm absolutely obsessed with it.<br />Try playing it you will to.<br />The part that l don't like is that you can't ride horses.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy the challenge.  Always fun to play this game when I am feeling a little bored.  As good as any other.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Fun and quirky...can't wait for the next album to come out. She has a unique sound and style worth paying for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway sufers is the best game in the world its better then temple run you can do a lot more fun stuff.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Not much to say other than what has already been written. I've had this overclocked on air around 3.9ghz for 10mo without an issue. It's a great all around chip. Video games, I/O, HD4000 isn't bad, wattage is much lower than Lynnfield Core i5's.<br /><br />I have it on an ASRocks Xtreme4 Z77 board and it's never been an issue. The stock cooler is also surprisingly good. Keeps things cool and isn't loud.<br /><br />Best bang for the buck in my opinion.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved the first book, but this book really improved the series for me. It was exciting, and the storyline never left you bored.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Almost 20 years since they last released an album; Jeff and Bill do not disappoint. This is what we've been waiting for.<br /><br />This album is AWESOME! Carcass tips there hat to the past, staying true to their roots while still taking a few hard and heavy steps forward. They establish who they are, their brand, yet still proving that they are not slowing down, softening up, or selling out. They are genuine and unapologetic about what they do. These guys can still top the competition.<br /><br />I am happy they worked with producer Colin Richardson again, even though after recording he quit two weeks into the mixing phase. However, engineer Andy Sneap stepped to help maintain that classic Carcass precision and he does a fantastic job maintaining their original sonic clarity and aggression. All parties involved made sure that Carcass and this album just explode from the speakers.<br /><br />Favorite songs: 316L Grade Surgical Steel, Unfit For Human Consumption, Captive Bolt Pistol, and Mount Of Execution.<br /><br />Carcass is, has been, and will always be the undisputed champions of what they do. They are not trying to be anyone else and they take great pride in being original.
B00ATTFGXS|4.0|I love the seamless integration with Alarm Clock Xtreme (my alarm clock of choice). Nice, simple, clean interface. Works great.<br /><br />I love that you can email the lap times, just really wish it was a share button in the stopwatch and not buried in the settings menu. That would make this 5 stars.
B002KKCW04|5.0|They fit well and are very comfortable. good support for the arch  I wear them almost every day, well worth the money.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|I like this game. It's a fun idea and executed well enough. Starts out easy enough to get the hang of it, then gets steadily more challenging and introduces new modes with almost every level.<br /><br />But I got bored with it pretty quick. Not a lot of staying power. I lost interest and uninstalled after 2 days.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|My grand isn't crazy about this but i think it's because its for an older child,  shes only 3 so I will see how she likes it as she gets older
B005KA188S|5.0|this movie i had got from you awile ago but i had forgotton to write you a review sorry about that;this was in excellent condition and i thank you for that i had no problems.
B000HX6DCO|5.0|This one's easy.  If you're a fan of South Park, then this movie is certainly a must see.  Actually, it's kind of hard to imagine a South Park fan that hasn't seen this movie.<br /><br />If you've never seen South Park, then you're either going to in for the treat of your life or you're really going to hate this.<br /><br />That said.  I'm giving it 5 stars...
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I think tom cruise does not quite fit the reacher character. otherwise I thought the movie was very good. would like to see more lee child books in movie version
B003B02OOG|5.0|These stories capture the heart and soul of storytelling and engage the reader from the very start. this book was excellent and I could not wait to read the next story after I had finished each one.
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|Belkin Portfolio Sleeve Carrying Case / B008X9Z3UC<br /><br />The product description for this item keeps changing; currently it's claiming to be made for the Kindle Fire 7\\" (while most of the reviews are saying no). I don't own a Kindle Fire, but I *do* own a Kindle Paperwhite with the Amazon-brand leather cover, and this carrying case is a perfect fit with just the right extra roominess around the edges.<br /><br />I love the Belkin brand because their cases always look really sleek (including the cute little stick-figure person logo) and put together well. This case is no exception; the combination of soft neoprene and sleek sturdy vinyl is perfect. The inside is a soft neoprene, perfect for keeping the Kindle screen scratch-free. The zipper is a solid piece -- I would have preferred a softer rubber (like on some of the CaseLogic cases), and it needs to be a tiny bit bigger in my opinion, but it's not a deal-breaker.<br /><br />I really wish that this case had made a side-pocket from the vinyl outside part, or included an inner pocket on the inside, but I guess that would have made it bulkier. I think I'm kind of a case-collector for my tablets and eReaders, since I keep searching for the perfect case and I have at least 8 different models and sizes so far. If Belkin made this model in multiple sizes, I'd ditch all my older cases and just go for this one on the grounds that it looks and feels so nice.<br /><br />NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
6301562178|4.0|The movie was much longer than it needed to be.  Became boring after a while, but overall it was interesting
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is so well written that I was right in the games with Katniss and Peeta. I felt their emotions--fear, anger, sympathy, Peeta's love for Katniss. I could imagine their pain, exhaustion, hunger, sleep deprivation. I liked that the author left room for hope of a better future. I will read the series and I hope the conclusion is positive. I would recommend the book with a cautionary aside that it could be upsetting even though it is fiction.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Excellent ! Wonderful movie about a young child trying to make sense of his world after the death of his father after the tragic event of 911.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|A+ on the board!  My Irish Mick love of my life for 33 years worships his Celtic Women.  Upbeat, wonderful, eye candy
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I loved the book it is funny cool and a great book for me to read it's my right kind of reading level I love diary of a wimpy kid I rate this book 5 stars because I love it so much. Read this book I beg you!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was a great blend between Sci-Fi and Western.  The main character was the guy you always wanted a main character to be, good, but not too good.  Shiny!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star trek fans will not be disappointed. I'm not a big fan of the packaging, however.  Do we really need that useless sleeve outside the jewel casing?
B009RX85N0|3.0|Love the series, but the discs had a few bad spots - not a lot, but annoying, just the same.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was raw, honest and very entertaining. I love Flynn's writing style! A great read! I am purchasing another book by her again.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|love it, love it, love it. action from begin to end. Chris pine has proved to be the right guy.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This nifty app lets me open my word, excel, and powerpoint files on my Kindle Fire HD.  I can edit and save the files to both dropbox and google drive if I like.<br /><br />The only negative I had was that I wanted to use it to display a powerpoint presentation to a group, but the quality of the files (which were much more graphics based) was lower than the original file and so it was not a feasible way for me to show the powerpoint.  Instead I saved the ppt as a pdf and showed it by scrolling through it via adobe reader.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Just as amazing as the others harry potter movies, wish series had more to come, but will settle for this.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Wonderful performance by Leonard. Great songs, will listen to this CD over and over. Also have the DVD of Live in London and have watched the DVD many times. I never get tired of seeing and listing to Leonard Cohen
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Lots of action, ledger was impressive, he owned the role of the joker. christian was great as usual love, love, love
B003GRWBW4|5.0|This is my favorite movie. It is different, but I find it inspirational and fun. I've showed this movie to many friends who have also loved it.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|great action, drama and mystery. Christian bale great as usual. the only thing is anne as cat woman felt she wasn't the right pick.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show. Very interesting and always ties things up pretty nicely by the end of the episode. Very easy to watch, especially via Prime!
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|Everyone in my family loves this cd. Great mix of horns and background vocals. Bought it for my teenager but wanted it back it was so good.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|th....the true story of what our health care delivery system.........means. The basis of this entirly engrossing story....is just how rediculous the US system is.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it to wake up each day to a song of my choice.<br />I also like that I can set the snooze with no issue, but I have set to require a math problem to turn it off.<br />No accidental cancels on my alarm
1878424319|3.0|I think it requires studying.  The first pages didn't attract me like I expected.  Overall I think the ideas are good.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Excellent game. Really addictive and so much choice within the game. Once you start playing you really can't stop. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good hidden object game who also enjoys a bit of puzzle gaming
B00CATSONE|4.0|Author lays a lot of background, and yes sometimes more than what's needed, although it is informative. That's what authors do. Only half way trough and at every opprotunity I pick up my phone to read it. It spurs my imagination to look at things a little different. Tesla was a creative soul who just kept moving in the direction he foresaw. Adversity is the mother of invention lol.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as advertised with all of my Apple devices.  One time setup took only minutes.  Just introduce Chromecast to your wi-fi network and away you go.
B008NMT684|3.0|He played with it for a few days and then just moved on to another game,l guess wasnt hard enough for him after while, but its a good game for 1 & 2 yr olds
B002QY9RMA|5.0|so many songs i like on one CD. loved every one of the songs. usually will buy if at least 3 favorite songs
159463176X|5.0|Here is the proof at last: you really can't judge a book by its cover.  In spite of the weak and inexplicable title (which, the author states, is adapted from a William Blake poem but has no reference or apparent meaning in the novel), this is a masterpiece of emotion and character development.  Even better written and more impactful, I think, than his earlier \\"Kite Runner.\\"  It is a collection of stories within the broader storyline arc, each chapter following one of the characters (or descendants thereof) involved with the opening protagonists, a separated brother and sister from Afghanistan.  The arc covers more than half a century and moves from Kabul to Greece to France to San Francisco.  Each chapter/story stands beautifully on its own, but because they interlock established characters, they lead to a predictably bittersweet but satisfying conclusion.  Rarely have I read such lush, controlled writing that wrings such emotion out of individuals and events that have been set in motion in the opening pages.  This is one of my favorite books of the past year, and its human insights are nothing short of amazing.  But why, Mr. Hosseini, did you settle for such an insipid title after \\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns?\\"  Your moving and memorable stories within the pages of this novel deserve better.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Loved it.  Quite a page turner just got Jack reached series. Reading them in order can't wait to get to number three
B00DYVUBYM|2.0|\\"The Bling Ring\\" tells the story of a group of teenagers who break into the homes of celebrities and steal clothing, jewelry, and money.  It is based on actual events.  It is a disaster. Its only redeeming feature is that it only lasts 90 minutes.  The female characters are interchangeable, including Emma Watson, whose appearance is garnering the most publicity. Her only memorable scene comes at the end of the film, where Nicki (Watson) is being interviewed for television.  Nicki admits is was hard being on the same cellblock as Lindsay Lohan, one of the victims.  No feeling of guilt, no remorse, and a touch of self pity.<br />  Some flattering comments on \\"The Bling Ring\\" from reviewing outlets must be in jest.  \\"Witty and Arresting\\" Entertainment Weekly.  This is wit?  No dialogue, no character development, repetitious, and boring. By the second heist, you can't wait for the police to show up.  \\"Arresting\\"?  I'll say.  \\"Teenage fun\\"?  Let me count the ways: first degree burglary, grand theft auto, illegal possession and use of a controlled substance, interstate transportation of stolen property, and sale of stolen property.  These juveniles are lucky they operated in California.  In most states, their sentences would have increased by a  factor of 10.  \\"Brilliant.  Highly Addictive.\\"  Salon.com.  It's addictive all right. Marc (Israel Broussard) can't walk two steps with inhaling something.  Rebecca (Katie Chang) has to get high to drive a car.  [If you want to see an outstanding film about the effects of drug use, I recommend Frank Sinatra's Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in \\"The Man With the Golden Arm\\".]<br />  I agree with Peter Travers, Rolling Stone: \\"Emma Watson is Sensational\\".  She is Mr. Travers, but not here.  This was a mistake, perhaps her second in a row if you count her cameo in \\"This Is The End\\".  If you want to see why she deserved the award as Best Young Actress, see \\"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\\" or \\"My Week with Marilyn\\", or even \\"Ballet Shoes\\", not to mention the \\"Harry Potter\\" series.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Really gone down hill over the course of the last two books. Such a shame but still happy I read the series.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|This is a great book it gets off to a slow start but after it gets going it is intense, too parents the book is violent, and there is some language, but ok for the rough age range of ten and up. AWESOME BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy install and setup. Netflix app works great (my new favorite Netflix app.) the Chrome browser cast to the TV with ease and a very good picture for watching Hulu Plus etc. My only 2 complaints are the limited apps and the fact that the only Chrome browser that can cast to the TV is from your computer, I wanted to use the Chrome browser on my Android tablet which is much easier to use for casting to the TV than a bulky laptop.<br /><br />Update: now that they have added Hulu Plus I'm very happy. I like the Netflix and Hulu Plus apps much better than the apps on my smart TV. Well worth the money and if they add the mobile Chrome browser to chromecast it would be awesome!
B008602KQI|1.0|It's at best a movie for children. In general nothing makes sense. Waste of time. I really don't recommend it.
B0068WEC0I|5.0|Awesome, CD I love every son and remixes. Michael will always be #1 in my book. love it totally !
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's very fun and exciting. There is always something new to find and create!!! I would be very careful though because you will love it and become addicted.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is an seriously awesome book on muscle building and fat loss.  Entertaining, no hype or nonsense, just a ton of solid, real-life information that works from someone who as achieved the goals we're all aiming for and really knows his stuff.  If you want hype and fluff and promises that are ridiculous and unrealistic - don't buy this book!  If you want the real deal - don't hesitate and get this one!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game takes a long time to load. My daughter likes it a lot. It looks nice on the Kindle fire.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I've only been playing for about an hour, but have enjoyed it so far. Lots of things to do, never at a loss for tasks. Kind of frustrating when you run out of energy, before tasks are completed. I think I will be playing this game for a long time. Did end up deleting this game after a couple of weeks. Became frustrated with being hounded to buy things.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Love it on my new phone. Live my new droid max. Good sound and context. Free is good also. Thanks
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My family loves The Avengers; we watch it at least once a week.  My boys are superhero fanatics so it never gets old to them.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a handy app with a comfortable, intuitive layout and excellent basic features. I especially love the alarm detail controls and sleep timer.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season, can't wait for the next one. What became of the governor and when will Darryl coming home? Will Karl turn into a cold blooded killer?
B00CI21EBC|5.0|yea! for this new collection from the Brand New Heavies, it's a true return to form of their first collections &#34;Brand New Heavies&#34; and &#34;Brother Sister&#34;. Funky R&B/Dance with a heavy 70's and 80's vibe. If you were a fan of the their earlier work before the intrusion of Siedah Garrett then you will really enjoy this. Not really to knock Siedah, but she was a bit too poppy and not enough funky, an interesting experiment, but....N'Dea Davenport also makes a welcome return on a few tracks though Jan Kincaid steps up to mike quite a few times also for the male perspecitve which is great. Throw in some instrumentals and it's like Average White Band meets Earth Wind and Fire (who also have a new record out). So get down, funk out and groove on with the Heavies.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Very interesting and enlightening. This book was to the point, and fascinating in every aspect. I look forward to reading more from the author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Started watching Downton Abbey and couldn't stop.  Sometime it was hard for me to understand what they were saying with their English accent, but that didn't stop me. Enjoyed watching EVERY episode!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Felt like I was in the 1700's and living in a state of no electricity , phone , car or Walmart and growing my own food . What magnificent human beings that had the stamina and will to struggle to give us this best of all countries with their blood , gold and sacrifices . Too bad it is eroding by complacency ,laziness and greedy selfishness of some of the folks today .We had remarkable and amazing forefathers , even with all their flaws . Amazing view of history .
1609611543|4.0|I bought this book for a friend.  She says that it is a little overboard but also has some very good ideas.
B001NLL93W|5.0|A good read. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and wanting more. Excited for the 1st movie to come out
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|No good choices.<br />All dull books .some books looked interesting but contentents were dire.<br />Would not recommend to any readers.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|This was OK...pretty boring.  I deleted it after 3 games.  It might be OK for kids to teach fundamental geometry.
B003FXCSNQ|4.0|Read the book and see the movie Blade Runner. A fascinating exploration on what it means to be human as technology rapidly makes enhancements and new life forms possible.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Profoundly insightful. Jobs was driven, really driven! He was intense, quirky, heartless, but like his products, often the secret to his success, was the simplicity and focus he applied relentlessly to producing perfect totally integrated products.  This book will change how you look at every consumer product you touch.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Amazing acting, incredible story line, full of suspense, action, and all the zombies you can take. This also goes for season one and two.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have already recommended this book to a few friends. I expect they will enjoy and learn as much as I did!  Thank you.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was under the impression that it work for my kindle fire.  Now I find that I need an app that is not available.
B00E6890RG|5.0|In my opinion, this band keeps getting better. This is by far their most mature release. The songwriting is very good. It's all about the song, no needless noodling like some bands. This album takes on a bit more atmospheric approach and (finally!) no death metal vocals. Every time I listen, it gets better!<br /><br />EDIT - As I stated above in my original review, it just keeps getting better! Well, I now proclaim that this is the album of the year!! This album is so good & so well written. It flows so well and I love the way they bring the musical themes back together at the end! If you love progressive rock you MUST have this in your collection!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think the show fantastic.  I really gives a sense of what life was like back then.  They had a lot of issues back then, just as society does today.  I am looking forward to season 4.  I am sad that this is the last season.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I really liked this film! I was on the edge the whole time! When the movie started I was uncertain of what to expect... In about two minutes, I was completely glued to my seat. I know the movie is not for everyone, but If you like Sci-fi,then you need to see this film. Some people think It's a knockoff of \\"I am Legend\\", but thaT IS NOT the truth. This was far less sentimental and sad. Check it out If you have a chance!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was so hard to put down. The characters are real and pull you into their lives. Many unexpected twist and I love the ending. I will be reading more from this author.
1451695195|5.0|Great insight and explanation by a medical doctor! Allows the skeptics to become believers of the magnitude of life, Earth and the afterlife.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I have had this for about a month(after seeing my friend use his quite often).  Now I don't leave home without it in a pocket.  Extremely bright, yet very comfortable to carry in a pocket all day.  I would highly recommend it!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Absolutely unique. Keeps you reading. Well written English novel. It is so nice to read a thoughtful work, not ground out as three book series.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|The quality of this concert is incredible. The picture is impeccable and the audio puts you right there in the front row. It's a wonderful benchmark video for testing a new theater system.<br />Make sure you set it to DTS-HD, it will blow you away.<br />It's a wonderful collection of amazing artists, genres, and classic songs that have encompassed multiple decades. They all showcase the wonderful work and life of Mr. Foster.<br />Buy this with no doubt in your mine!
1616550414|4.0|But I would love for there to have been more full or half-page prints of more of the characters. I feel like some of the characters were left out a bit, and I really wanted to see them in more detail.<br /><br />Either way, I'm really enjoying reading the history of Hyrule and the histories of some of the characters. I've not gotten very deep into it, but it's written very well.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|true story about autism portraying Temple Grandin who is alive & well & teaching @ a University. A very informative movie.
B00C061I1M|5.0|Roots music at its purest. All the blues and bluegrass you might expect of a true daughter of Tennessee. Sounds like the long lost love child of Dolly Parton and Bille Holliday.
B00D5YNQMW|5.0|music lover's this concert is good. a must have! there is yapping in between songs but very short and your back in the groove, songs choices for this concert are excellent. So if you have the right system you are will love this.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|I enjoyed the game - it's a good brain workout especially as you get older.  Good to stimulate your mind.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show was much funnier than I anticipated. I recommend it to anyone who wants a laugh no matter the age
B00594XOZU|1.0|I didn't ask for this app but it's on every electronic I own. What???? Is this the government app???? It's just as invasive!!! That alone rates it negative 5 ★'s but that's not an option....
B005LAIH2M|5.0|talk about really great gore,brings back memories from the past,truly an underrated film loved the whole movie thanks for a good deal.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait for book 3!!!!! Amassing wonderful spectacular trivial deep best book ever! I'm dying to read the next one
B008JFUPK8|5.0|While I can see and understand some of the complaints against this film, some of them, on the other hand, are hypocritical nonsense.<br /><br />The internet isn't the best way to put a films reception into perspective. From perusing comic book message boards you would think this is the most hated film of all time. Not so. It is mostly met with favorable praise. But the vocal minority is REALLY vocal on this one. Complaints about structure and editing are one thing (I don't agree with them at all but they are legitimate) but the huge hubbub over the destruction in this film is over the top and frankly all out misguided and downright false.<br /><br />It seems the internet can't make up it's mind on what they want their Superman to be. For YEARS all fans ever did was say they wanted a Superman movie where he can really show off his powers. They begged and whined and pleaded for a Superman film to deliver the action that the character deserves on screen. And when Superman Returns came out that begging and pleaded grew exponentially. \\"WE WANT SUPERMAN TO PUNCH SOMETHING!\\" seemed to be the go-to phrase. People finally get what they were whining for and what do they do? They turn their nose up at it.<br /><br />The way people complain about the action you would think this is nothing but wall to wall mindless explosions. This is not so at all. After the opening scenes on Krypton and a quick rescue on an oil rig the film doesn't have much action until the last act kicks in. The last act is no longer or drawn out than The Avengers ofr any of the Nolan Batman films. In fact I think I read somewhere the finale to Batman Begins is a few minute longer than Man of Steel.<br /><br />For one thing this is a superhero movie. Two, this isn't only a superhero movie but a SUPERMAN movie! What, you don't expect insane action and visuals? Really? The action in this film is incredible. It's hard hitting, edge of your seat kind of stuff. THIS IS WHAT SUPERMAN SHOULD LOOK LIKE ON THE BIG SCREEN!<br /><br />Whiny fanboys go on and on and ON about the amount of destruction in this film like it's Supes fault. They literally blame the destruction on Superman like he caused it all. If one simply watches the film with the most minimal amount of attention they will know this is simply, idiotically false. The most purely destructive thing Superman himself directly does is crash Zod through a gas station. Literally everything else is Zods fault. Superman tries the whole last act to stop them and gets his butt handed to him a lot of the time.<br /><br />Another HUGE misconception is that the final fight in Metropolis is horrible because it's in the middle of the city and causing more death. Again, if people paid a modicum of attention they would have seen that the entire portion of the city they were fighting in is DESERTED. TOTALLY DESERTED. No people around.<br /><br />I for one am glad the destruction in this film was so realistic. People were shown to really be dying and in peril. Most other superhero films feel safe in this regard, like nobody is really in jeopardy. It's safe, clean destruction. Not so in Man of Steel. It makes Superman feel MORE like a hero and not a perfect action figure imo that he has to struggle and can't save every living soul. Did people really want him to just fly around catching people out of windows the whole time? \\"WAH Metropolis got destroyed ans Superman didn't save enough people!\\" I'm sorry, did you not see him save the ENTIRE world by destroying the World Engine, which damn near took him out as well? I guess not.<br /><br />I know I'm ranting but I can't help but feel a lot of the reactions to this film are misguided in the extreme. This is the mythic, larger than life Superman film we've been needing. And mythic is exactly what Superman is. This isn't the joyless shell people are making it out to be either. There is light comedy sprinkled throughout the film. It's the Batman Begins of Superman. I have a feeling if this cameout around 2005 or so it wouldn't have gotten the fanboy slamming it did.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love playing this game....you have to go fast to get high score.  I like competing with friends.  Keeps u on your toes!  Adults like playing.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I liked the show very much.  However, it stopped and started too many times on each episode.  I finally went to Netflix to watch the rest of the series.  Can you tell me what to do to keep that from happening?
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game is very interactive a lot of different mini games. It is a little scary but other than that it is overall a very fun game
B008HK3XYK|3.0|The case cannot hold the Kindle much past a 35 degree angle from perpendicular. It uses friction to keep it standing. The kindle is held securely by the plastic snap-in holder. An elastic band holds the case closed. The case has held-up well after a about 45 days of use.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|--the story is fun--and the cover is even better; the plot is predictable but fun to read--characters are funny and hold the story well--
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love Kevin Bacon and loved the suspense of this show!  Had me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait until the next season!
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|...only because I can't figure out how to give it seven stars.<br /><br />Other than that, what everyone else has said.  A perfect blend of Necroticism and Heartwork.  The album old-timers like me were hoping Swansong would be.  The best metal record I have heard this year. Etc.<br /><br />Bill Steer's guitarwork is amazing.  The drumming is great.  The lyrics are clever as hell.  Even the oft-ignored bass playing is great.<br /><br />It is astonishing that a band can take 17 years off, come back like nothing happened and slap everyone silly.<br /><br />I can't see how anyone who likes death/speed/extreme metal wouldn't like this at least a little bit.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I had the pleasure of attending &#34;The Jersey Boys&#34; show with a group of friends and bought one for myself afterwards and one for one of the friends for Christmas - I had drawn her name for a gift and she loved it.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great beginning and great re-tell of how Captain America came to be they way he is.  Not sure why his shield changed shapes
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Ziplock more secure than the snap books. I would like a greater variety of colors to choose from.  Personally I like purple or a variation.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The British kick butt when it comes to their TV series or mini-dramas. kudos to Broadchurch and may there be many more like it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's cool how you can fail asleep to your favorite music, and I've never not been awakened by the alarms
B002WV5A9G|4.0|The new Star Trek franchise starts with this movie.  It's hard to call it a reboot, since it's more of an alternate universe.  To me, that gives it leeway to be different from the original.  So don't go into it expecting it to be just like the Star Trek you remembered from TV, or even the original franchise movies.  This version is more big action flick than those were.  Bigger budget, too.<br /><br />That said, it suffers from some of the same problems as other big budget action flicks.  Sometimes character development lags in favor of more action on the screen.  Other times they substitute pithy dialog or visual gags instead.  Yet once they get to the meat of the storyline the pace picks up and you aren't paying attention to anything but the sheer fun of it all.<br /><br />The only thing I really dislike about the movie is the director's frequent use of lens flare.  I get that it's a stylistic thing, but boy is it distracting!  I felt like I needed sunglasses to watch the movie!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I bought the world expansion and it didn't work!!!!!!!!!! I wasted my money on some stupid came That's a copy of scribblenauts unlimited
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it, even while at work.  I feel like I know these people, and can't wait for Season 4.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You will be hooked w this game why I don't know lol so simple but yet so much fun! My 6yr old nephew loves it!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Shazam is the coolest App!!! I love it! When someone says who is singing that song? I can get the answer immediately! Love, love, love it!!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|amazing to think something like this could happen in america. Admired author's honesty. Applauded her overcoming and turning around her life!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I enjoy the characters interaction.  Not necesarily the infedelity which this is sometimes the main topic.<br />great scripts and performances.
B0049J5EWW|5.0|Excellent movie. I loved it as a child and so does my 6 month old son. Definitely will always be a classic.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was incredible always kept me on my toes wanting to continuously read , it was riveting and now I can't wait to continue the series !
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I find the it shows me all the things I have on my system and gives me the opportunity to remove the apps that no longer apply. I tutor for elementary school and have some apps that don't apply now and it is easy to remove them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season! Seems to be about on how people can react with long term disasters/ stress.  Can't wait for season 4!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|after viewing this in the theater, I purchased it for my sister-of-the-heart. this group of actors just knocks it out of the park for real and heart-breaking situations and emotions for we retired folk.
B000JJSRNY|4.0|It’s a feast for the eye and ear. Top performance, crystal clear picture. Too much audience shots distracted viewers away from the performance, that’s a pity.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|the arrangements sounded familiar-but-better and Vince Gills beautiful voice is an improvement on the old originals in all cuts - don't know Paul Franklin, sorry for ignorance - instrumentals and arrangements are terrific
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is an amazingly entertaining puzzle game with stunning graphics and a story that's both mysterious and beautiful. The concept is simple, but the levels are increasingly difficult as you progress through the game. Each chapter brings new surprises and elements. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a fun challenge--playing World of Goo is like reading a well written (and illustrated) novel.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|Very happy with this tracker. Would highly recommend. When paired with the partner software My Fitness Pal it becomes totally awesome.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This is a well written, acted and produced series.  The cast is excellent and I can't think of anyone better to play the lead parts.  Following the dynamics of the motorcycle club within itself, the community and rival clubs makes for a very entertaining show.  It can get violent so if you are against that do not watch it. The show however is not built around the violence but around the personalities and interactions of the characters.  You won't be disappointed with this show
B001PJRAUS|5.0|A fun little movie.  Kind of like what any reader might think of if they placed themselves inside the story.  Of course your going to imagine your presence making changes and unless you watch out you might find a much different story in your head before you reach the final page.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This was the first game I played by this company and I became hooked. I enjoyed the different levels of challenges the game provided. It kept my attention and had me looking for more. I would recommend this game to others.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a very fun game, they should be more ways to win free diamonds because of how much the points are. But other then that it's pretty cute.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is classic nineteenth century writing ... also I recommend 'Dracula ... The Un-Dead' by Bram Stoker's Great Grandnephew, Dacre Stoker, as a follow-on ... it has more action and is filled with true historical events melded into the story.
1781162646|4.0|Slow to start but picked up toward the middle. S, King is a master at character description and setting. Reaches out to grab you.
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I like this game but it is hard to do it on kindle it is easier for for the book and paper
B000PKX2KA|5.0|This GlobalSat BU-353 USB GPS Navigation Receiver works very well. When installing the unit and connecting it with Raster Maps, make sure you understand how they speak to each other. Use the install disk.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This bee version is HORRIBLE! Had to reinstall twice and lost all my points both times. Freezes and stops all the time. Bring back the old! please?!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It kept me reading.  Not sure yet if I liked the ending.  I have to think a out it for awhile!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The writing was well done, the plot kept me interested and I enjoyed the side stories.  Read it!
B0001I561E|5.0|one of the classics from disney that never disappoints and always provides enjoyment no matter what age you are! Kudos!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book to read in one afternoon. The character development is interesting; the plot keeps your attention. The end has some thoughtful suppositions. I admit I did not anticipate the ending. I highly recommend!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|One of his best - truly likeable characters - easy to become invested.  Love a book that I miss when its finished
0744014956|5.0|Super in-depth information of all missions, side missions, vehicles and their specs, car customization, skills, activities. Basically, everything in the game. All bound in a super sleek, elegant hardcover. Must have for die-hard GTA fans. Also brings a lithograph, which is a fancy word for a high quality piece of artwork from the game, which comes in its own little GTA themed envelope/folder.
B00ARF92HK|2.0|I saw the original Judge Dredd with Stallone.  It was disappointing at best.  This movie took a flop and just added in modern elements, in an attempt to make it relevant again.  It failed.  Intense graphic violence, violent sex, excessive use of heavy drugs, etc., etc., well, you get the point.<br />Nothing says enjoyable movie time like seeing someone's brains coming out of the back of their head.  Nothing gives you the movie warm fuzzies more than seeing some thug sexually assault and rape a police officer - even if it is only virtually.  This movie was an assault on all of the senses and you just feel bad and dirty after watching it.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|this is the very best angry birds yet great game and great picture's. its just an amazing way better then all the others trust me its worth it!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love it when it works.  Today it kicked me out of every round of the daily tourney without letting me play a single round.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper finds herself in the wrong place in her life and times and waits almost ten years to pay for it.  The rote approach to penalizing violators demonstrates how blind and lacking our penal system is at sorting out the ones who need to be controlled; those who could be rehabilitated; and those who need to be identified judicially for their mistakes, but not formally contained in the penal housing system for no reason but to demonstrate punitive reaction to past deeds.  There is a better way, but until the not so smart legislative rule makers at all levels demonstrate a higher level of understanding and policy making it would seem that we are stuck with blind and rote rule making that does not relate to conserving resources or making the world any better.<br /><br />Read this and then take action to help the elected blind and uninformed public smarten up--maybe just a little.
B00915G6MG|5.0|The best show on TV!!!  Great characters and superior actors and actresses.  My only complaint would be to fix the clock on the outside of the NCIS building.
B003WE9WRI|4.0|The book is a generic zombie book and I only read it to lay the foundation for World War Z. The mock case studies Brooks write is what sets this book apart from others. His research toward the cultural intricacies is especially good.
8866137634|5.0|I like the notebook.  Small enough to carry around to use to take notes and jot ideas. The Evernote integration helps me snap a photo and store-tag the pages. So I'll have the notebook with me at all times.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This book just smacks of quality research on the economics, socio- political, and psychological!<br /><br />I am an South African and his chapters involving South Africa felt like it was written by a South African (just the one with Nelson Mandela was a bit contrived). However, the scents, the sounds and the way of talking (descriptions, slang etc) hit the nail on the head. It is a pity that the movie version was such a terrible interpretation of this gem. Hopefully though many people will buy this book after seeing the movie and be acquainted with Brooks' deep insight toward the responses of people and nations in large scale catastrophes.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|The Elite is a very emotionally draining book. This is not a happy-go-lucky edition to the series at all, and I would not suggest reading it while you are already in a crappy mood unless you want to add to your already bad mood. I am kind of glad that there is only one more book left in the series, because I really want this love triangle to end. I don't like love triangles already, but this one is just dragging on with no hint of it being resolved. My feelings on Maxon have changed a lot and he isn't the sweet guy I thought he was. Regardless I still don't want America with Aspen, so Maxon better shape up. On the positive side America is finally gaining self confidence and is realizing her potential. I thought that was a really great thing that came out of book two.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was my first lawyer book by grisham. It wasn't what i thought it be like, it was way better. Characters i cared about, and finding myself really getting into. Had some really funny parts. I recommend this book to others.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|It was better than expected the twist and turns in it make it a on your edge of your seat type of movie!!!
B005DD7H50|4.0|Bradley Cooper was really good. The plot was well crafted but the supporting actors a were dull and shallow. Didn't really feel any of them were developed well enough to be real people, but entertaining nevertheless.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|was not prepared for losing some of my favorite characters but the rest of the characters more than made up for it!!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Passable who-dunnit movie. Good special effects. Surprisingly good acting. Predictable, over used plot arc and conclusion. Not a bad 4 buck rental....no reason to purchase.
B0081336FO|5.0|I can'y say enough good things about this series. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for the new season
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Love this album.  I heard the npr interview with John Fogerty and immediately downloaded this album.  I've never been a big fan of covers, but these are not covers at all.  The artist collaborates with other artists on his own songs, creating the perfect blend of nostalgia, familiarity, and new sound.  John Fogerty is wonderful, and just as powerful, if not more, as when I grew up on his music in the 70s.  This is an excellent addition to my collection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can not recommend this book more. Its a smart, funny, touching story with characters that stay with you long after you've finished.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the wholes series so far.  I can't wait for the fourth season!!  I only hate that one of my favorite characters was killed!
B005544TRQ|4.0|Pulls you in with lovable characters and story line of good verses evil. I can't stop watching it!  Makes me wish I went to law school.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|This movie was a waste on money. Only reason it gets watched is because of Dicaprio.  And don't get me started on the rap music in the 20/30's really...
B00520R146|5.0|Toy Story 3 is a great movie! I love Tom Hanks. I love Tim Allen. It is a Toys 'r Us people. You do not throw people away when they are old and worn out. Right?
B00BG08FKK|4.0|Having said that it is good for the movie. Hearing it after seeing the movie keeps it alive. But I would recommend the Broadway version if you have to choose.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  So much so I have given it to each one of my relatives to read who are &#34;non-believers&#34; in out of body experiences!  Your book has converted a few people in my family!
B000051WDE|1.0|I FINALLY GOT MY MOVIE AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF LATNESS AND THE DAMN THING WONT EVEN PLAY......&#62;[ WHY ME?????
B0064X7FVE|4.0|for advance weather i first go to this app. i live in Oklahoma where weather is important so i go here for a balance of all the local weathermen.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Not much to say, except is it possible for the actors to make a more tepid effort? I don't think so. Definitely a straight-to-video effort by actors who normally have a lot to offer, but in this case clearly hated the story and made every effort to demonstrate that through their minimalist effort.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is an awesomely hilarious SciFi short story. Very quick read and very entertaining. It even won a Hugo award. I highly recommend reading it if you are a fan of SciFi in any format.
B007N8RULO|3.0|Too many ad`s and every few games I have to download the game again as if it stops the game and brings me to this get app screen. Highly annoying just for the basic features when there are many other options. Other than that I get lost in the enjoyment of spider, and lose a lot of time.... Lol wish there was a way to have a tournament or play against 1 other person.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My kids (tween and teen) like to play this when we get stuck waiting somewhere.  It works well on the Kindle Fire and the price is unbeatable.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book set in the future, is about a boy who grows up in a world of plain life with no pain, no feeling and no memories of the past. When he meet the giver he finds out memories of the world's past. And he selects to go on a quest to find out where these memories of happiness, pain and strength came from to change the world that he has known for twelve years.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Loved this season. Some of the storylines were predictable but then a twist at the finale! Can't wait for next season!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This sucks...... third time downloading this on my kindle lets see if it works...... highly unlikely. I love this game on .my xbox and ps3 &amp; been playing it in card form since it came out
020530902X|5.0|Very informative and easy to read and understand. A great book for college students that need help writing their papers.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My brother started playing this game, now I play all the time. Great game for people who dont want to play all day.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am so happy with this product and how quick I received it. I usually always try and buy products that are closest to Nevada to get them quicker but you cant beat next day!! The dvd case is in excellent shape THANK YOU from myself and my two year old!
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|I like this book it is write in a very practical way it is divided in several lectures of a single pages, every lecture contains alot of practical advise based on autor´s experience, also, it have good examples that are practical for managers like how to prioritize, how to keep effective meetings, etc.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I love Olive Office, and I still use it, but Kingsoft Office has a much friendlier user interface.  The Word environment looks more like the Microsoft Word I'm used to seeing.  My only pet peeve is the font change that occurs when I pull up my drafts in Kingsoft; however, as it is only a rough draft anyway and the change is only visual (it returns to my normal font when I return it to Word on my computer), I can live with it.  I wish I'd tried this one first!
0880796863|2.0|I was under the impression that I was getting a book deck of cards and a guide! The only thing I received was the cards with a tiny little mini book tucked in with the cards. Product is in good condition yes but not what I expected.
B008469DGY|4.0|Flick Golf is a good game for when you just have a couple of minutes to pass.  The graphics are really good and control is easy and responsive.  I don't play a lot of games on my Kindle, but I'll keep this one.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Yes Lincoln helped abolish slavery but I was hoping to see a movie that focused on a more balanced telling of Lincoln and his life.  This was really about the abolishment of slavery and I wasn't impressed.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Don't know just how these disks were burned but it is definitely hit or miss whether your Blu-ray player will be compatible. I've been able to use my laptop to watch them but my home media player, a 3 year old Samsung won't even make it as far as the menu.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased the Chromecast directly from Google. It's the best thing ever to use with my Motorola Droid. Works great with Android tablet. It's really nice that you don't have to fumble for the remote control. The best is the \\"YouTube\\" usage is better than Roku. The best thing is you can type the smartphone keyboard easier than the remote control. The price point is unbeatable. I really like the portability of this device. Just unplug and slip in pocket and ready to go.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|My mother saw the program for this CD on TV recently and was eager to gt the music. I went looking online and was happy to see Amazon had it for such a great price (just under $10).  I ordered the CD and was happy to see I could get an instant download free with the purchase.  I just recently purchased my mother a Kindle and this was my first experience buying music with the download option.  She was listening to it the next day.  Great artists and great music. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|People who whine about characters changing and being added need to zip it.<br /><br />This book is awesome.<br /><br />Go buy it if you're a true fan.
B000FA5STS|5.0|I was told about this from someone else, and from what she said I HAD to read it.  I got it and am very glad I did.  SUSPENSE!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game does make you use your brain but not so much that it hurts. It was very enjoyable and while I played it the time just flew by. I would love to see more levels.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|What else do you say? Franco ruins the whole thing.  Terrible movie.  They could have done so much more with this.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Just what I wanted, it covers perfectly the iphone, does not make it tick or difficult to handle, it was easy to put and has a nice shade discrete color.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed the story and didn't realize it was based on a real train, that took orphan children to small farming towns to relocate them with families.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I had wanted to see this movie but got mixed reviews from my friends so I wasn't sure what to expect. It far exceeded my expectations and was actually good.
B00AC8ZJ6K|3.0|Was expecting something totally different, live actors sent me for a loop. It wasn't bad for what it was...<br />Acting wasn't horrible but not top end.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Finally found the kind of match three I was looking for.  Good graphics. Easy pace but still challenging enough to clear my head of all the days problems.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|The lead guitar hides behind the sloppy super loose sounding skins of the floor tom and bass drum, and really sounds like trash when he ups his kicks. I listen to a bunch of different music and never have to tweak my EQ as much as I did to get this CD to sound decent/clear.<br /><br />Aside from that this whole album sounds pretty generic. There wasn't one point in the entire album where my ears perk up.  IMO there's no chance this album would see the light of day on its own merit, but there's a bunch of 5stars here so to each their own.<br /><br />As for my copy: Its sole job now is to protect the fine finish of my walmart computer desk.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the diverse selection of games you can play! I've had a lot of fun with them. It really tests your skills.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great with Bill paying and balancing my checkbook.  I use it instead of my cell phone app.  Easy to read #.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This will keep you guessing until the absolute LAST page. A nonstop ride in DC. Characters were so intricate. You understood from<br />the beginning that this wasn't going to be your grandmas thriller...Awesome!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Great watch! Small face for thin arms. Keeps time great and very comfortable to wear. Not sure how long the band will last but I enjoy it.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I have enjoyed all the episodes. I wanted to watch them all at once. Can't wait to see season 3.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I made it halfway through the book and couldn't take it anymore.  If you do decide to waste your time reading \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" because this book somehow is a Bestseller, please count how many times the word \\"murmur\\" is used...
B00DCP0082|5.0|This is the first time that I've sat down and listened to Annihilator in their glory. Sure, I've dabbled with them on certain songs from recent albums, but nothing like this. I wasn't prepared for the metal onslaught that was begging to be released from their new album, Feast. When I was finished, my mind was blown away.<br /><br />Everything about this album is amazing from a musician standpoint. A lot of groove, very catchy on most of the songs, and the musicianship between all the band members is top-notch. Dave Padden, vocalist for the band, also steps up when he's on the batting plate and delivers one homerun after another with vocals that are diverse and easy to understand, going from clean singing to clean screaming. You won't find any cookie-monster vocals that most death-metal bands rely on, for Dave is easy to understand and he gets the message across easily with decent lyrics that drives the point home. The solos from Jeff and I believe from Dave (at times) are amazing and fit each of the songs well, while the bass and drums do their best to keep the beat going (and do it well in style, in fact!).<br /><br />That's another mention I should give - the production. Everything is heard clearly on both sides of the speakers and even the bass is given time to shine on all the songs, especially in certain moments in certain songs.<br /><br />The only flaw on here is the ballad itself, which ruins the moment briefly, but it still holds up as a solid song of its own. The rest of the songs are nowhere near as forgettable or least memorable as the ballad. If you're lucky enough to get the limited edition, Re-Kill is an excellent CD of its own, delivering classics that were re-done in 2012 and enabling new fans, such as myself, to get a taste of what the old classics were like with a bit of a modern touch sprinkled on it. All of them are awesome in their own right, such as Alison Hell, Fun Palace, King Of The Kill, and Bloodbath.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Annihilator or are completely new to the band and want a good starting point, Feast is the right album to check out!
B002WY65W4|5.0|I like zombie movies in general, but good zombie movies are scarce. This movie doesn't take its self seriously and the cast works very well together. Woody Harrelson rocks. While the tone is pretty light throughout, there are scenes with tension and suspense that round it out quite nicely. This is a classic and most buy for anyone that enjoys a funny zombie movie.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|The best i have read after Anathem. Author is really good. Read everything he wrote) Will recommend to my friends.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This show is perhaps the best series ever. The sets, costumes, acting and storyline are all top shelf. It does run very dark and gruesome though, so it's probably best avoided by the squeamish.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|It really could have been a cute movie, but it ended up being full of suggestive, rude, crap. Why do they do that?
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can't remember where I got interested in this series, but reading all the Greek Myths reminds me of a teacher I had in High school, who is also Greek.  I always loved history and ancient times.<br /><br />I read these with a young reader I used to look after, I can't wait to read with her again (from the other side of the world now.)  We love reading about Percy, his adventures and all that come with being a Demigod.<br /><br />This book is great!  I get Annabeth's perspective is something that I have been wanting to read since The Lost Hero, when we learned that Annabeth and Percy would be back.  Loved reading about the travels to Europe/ Italy, because I have been there, and remember my first reaction seeing all the great monuments in person.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next two books, and Hope* there are future books, even though I do wish Percy will be able to relax, should he survive this next books...
B0036FYO12|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and was thrilled to be able to watch again.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B00DY951TO|5.0|Unbelievable takes by the Master! A treat like candy for my later years and my going ears...the vinyl is so clean and full of emotion. A big THANK YOU for the  opportunity to revisit my youth! Thanks for the thoughtfulness, Bob.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This is a classic! We have watched this movie many times. It still makes us smile! Love this rendition of the Cinderella story.
B009LDD54K|5.0|I have watched this dvd over and over again, and I still see something new.  I purposely do not have HBO, because I want to wait until the dvd comes out.  I can't wait for season 4.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I am a senior citizen. The music is to loud,  I have a hard time trying to hear the  dialog.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an awesome game but there are only 10 levels and the rest are &quot;coming soon&quot;. I wish it lasted longer, super addicting game.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I am a senior citizen, for me they play the music to loud and makes it hard to hear the dialog.
B00005RDRO|5.0|This is a hilarious all-star cast that if you've not seen it, you need to.  It's such a joy to see all these old-time actors, I believe they're all gone but two.  Such a hoot and the twists and turns just make it all the more fun.  Highly recommend.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I am only 75% into and think it wonderful.  The writing is informative and exciting.  As a seeker in the way of spirituality this is the perfect book for where I am.  It is also one I will re-read and share with friends.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book from my favorite Author John Grisham. I  enjoy reading this author's book a great deal. He make it to where you are caught up in the book as if you are one of the characters.
1612680003|5.0|This was an easy to read book that will implant great seeds into your head to build greater wealth for you in the long run.  He gives you tips on what resources he used at his disposal to get better at financial literacy to better yourself.  Great book!  Thanks!
B00EKR61FM|5.0|I own all of the movies but only on DvD and can't wait to buy this Blu-ray box set. Mostly for deleted scenes from breaking dawn part 2.
0061438294|5.0|I have learned so much about body language with this book that I would recommend anyone to get it.  It has really opened my eyes on how we communicate with each other.  And, I didn't know about how the feet were very important on determining the reactions in others.  Very well done, thanks!
B008M0NDOK|5.0|This brought new life to N.O.V.A. 3. I gave up on that game a while back. Got this...ooooh I love the game now! In fact, I bought 3 more. Now my kids and I play multiplayer games over wifi-4 of us. So cool! There are only about 7 games supported, but if you're jailbroken, get Blutrol. Then you can set it up to play anything. And for $7, this is a good buy, even for only 1 game.
0316017930|5.0|I love Malcolm Gladwell's writing style.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book very much and could not put it down.  I like how he sets up a sequence of events in a story that is full of facts and perceptions, that by the time he gets to the juicy stuff, I have already been intrigued and ready to learn something else I did not know about people and success.  Thanks!
0439023513|5.0|I loved it. I inhaled every page. I was sorry to have finished reading the book.  I fell in love with the characters, all of them!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game keeps you going for hours.  My kid loves it as well. I would definitely recommend this game to others
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I enjoy the glimpse of the lifestyle of that period and the interactions of the characters. What a house to maintain.
B005IF7HNA|5.0|A solid spinoff. Not nearly as light hearted as Dr. WHO  though but def worth the watch to see how Earth and Cptn Jack deal
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I have played this game on my friends kindle and just got it on mine. This game is really different. Some might think it's the queerest game ever but I really like it and would recommend this to all my friends, and if they don't have the ability to get it, then I will tell them to by a kindle just for this game.
B00C7AXJMW|5.0|Great finale to the trilogy, what more can i say?  I don't know but Amazon makes me write more words.
0061765236|5.0|This book is a heartbreaking classic! If you want a REAL story then purchase this book! The relationship between the two main characters is so intense. You'll root for Christopher the entire way when the love of his life is taken from him & her mother painfully tries to hold him responsible for something she may never understand. Guilt, betrayal, loyalty, confusion, jealousy & love rock this book to corners that t times are uncomfortable to go to, but are worth it at the end.
B0018OFNHC|3.0|Awesome movie! Only gave it 3 stars because the movie kept pausing randomly throughout on all the devices I tried watching it on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone no doubt!<br />FABULOUS!!! Can't wa5 to read # 3  starting now lol !
B00AHTYI5M|2.0|Best picture? Humbug! This film has all the artistry of a \\"Taken\\" movie.  The directors wing of the Academy were spot on when they didn't nominate Ben Affleck for an Oscar.  I could accept the mind numbing sameness of this venture if it didn't play so fast and loose with the truth.  It's a totally disingenuous diatribe whose clear intent is to exonerate the bumbling Carter administration whose impotence was never more apparent than in the Iran hostage crisis.  The makers many sins include diminishing the role of the Canadians in facilitating the escape of the six hostages, slandering the Australian government, and omitting that on the day the remaining hostages were released was when Ronald Reagan was sworn in.  The left love patting themselves on the back so they can have \\"Argo\\".  Steven Spielberg and \\"Lincoln\\" wuz robbed.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|There should be a purchase price on the game itself and get rid of the tokens, especially if you are going to only offer 1 bonus every 45 mins to an hour and said bonus only gives you 2 plays
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Every generation has a film or films that define them.  For me it was \\"Animal House\\" for my younger sisters it was \\"Footloose\\" and \\"Dirty Dancing\\".  I can see why the kids today would identify so strongly with \\"Pitch Perfect\\".  This saga of a women's competitive collegiate a cappella group is predictably plotted but compensates with a resounding energy and joyfulness.  I'm fifty and my wife isn't quite fifty yet but we both loved it her more than I.  This movie is fun for all ages or those who are chronically immature like myself.
0345803485|1.0|i CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I FELL INTO THE HYPE! She is such an awful writer and the book becomes extremely repetitious. I can only get so much of the red room at a time. I couldn't complete it. Terrible read.
6304806418|5.0|I loved this movie the only issue I had was the disc started playing after 19mins  or it didn't start  from the beginning
B00ECUARO8|2.0|The acting was good, the plot was thin, the scenes were predictable. The movie would have fared better without the violent shootings
B000MD9UJC|5.0|It works great! The only con is that it doesn't have much room to focus and once it's focused perfectly, it's very close to coming apart. Other than that, this thing is awesome! It's bright and easy to use with one hand, which I'm forced to do a lot as I am a mechanic.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I didn't see the series when it was originally on the air, but popular feedback from those who had got me curious.  Yes, the series was terminated way too soon and had a lot of potential.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I bought this CD for my dad who LOVES the sound of Iz's voice. He listens to it many times during the week. Thanks for the seamless transaction.
B00BX8PG4S|2.0|Considering it deals with the possible annihilation of all life on the planet, you'd think \\"Phantom,\\" written and directed by Todd Robinson, would be a more interesting and compelling film than it turns out to be. Instead, it's an anachronistic Cold War tale that couldn't feel more remote and irrelevant to the world of today. And it doesn't help one bit that the story is based on some actual events that occurred in 1968.<br /><br />Ed Harris plays a veteran submarine captain for the Russian navy who's sent on a mysterious mission with some possibly rogue elite KGB agents on board. What they're up to is anyone's guess, but could it have something to do with wresting control of the ship's nuclear missile from the captain and the crew?<br /><br />Even if you can get past the rather disconcerting spectacle of a cast of all-American actors portraying unaccented Russians, you're still left with having to wade through a muddled story, the logistics of which are so arcane and esoteric that we often can't figure out what's going on (we just know by the actors' grim demeanor that it is all Very Very Serious).<br /><br />And just as you're about to give the movie credit for at least daring to show things from the other side of the Cold War, Harris delivers a speech so absurdly complimentary of the Americans that Thomas Paine himself could have written it. And just as you're about to congratulate it for not going for the obligatory deep dive/popping rivet scene, down we go to the bottom (in  more ways than one), as it all culminates in a scene that is so embarrassing it has to be seen to be believed.<br /><br />Harris does yeoman work in service to the cause, though David Duchovny is a bit stiff as a psychotic KGB operative. But even the finest of performances wouldn't be enough to keep us from nodding off as the world stands on the brink of thermonuclear self-destruction.<br /><br />It's probably safe to say that \\"Das Boot\\" has spoiled us for all subsequent submarinar dramas, but \\"Phantom\\" barely even tries.but \\"Phantom\\" barely even tries.
1442364203|5.0|My daughter has been looking for this book. I was so excited to turn to Amazon and find it. My daughter had previously read The Kite Runner and loves the writers characters and style.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|This rates right up there with &#34;The Good , The Bad, and The Ugly&#34;.<br />Music score by Morricone is fantastic.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|After my husband met him in person I read his book and it made me cry! Awesome people do and go through incredible things!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This book is very unique. It is based on a serial killer that I can empathize with, a killer that kills people for wasting his time. How many of us out there wish they could just push the person out of line for taking forever at starbucks? well this guy went a little further than that. The detectives on the case are young and energetic something you don't see in most murder mysteries. You mostly see old experienced detectives doing the same old same old. I see where Thiede was going with this. These detectives are working out of the small town of Rockton Illinois. I looked up this town (yes it exists) and the total population of just slightly over 7000 people. I have read a few reviews about how the detectives are too young and have too much childish action well if you lived in a town that small maybe these are the only detectives you can get. This story works so well because Thiede actually used the real world in real situations. Once I understood this the book was even better. I love that this is the first book of a series.
0345525558|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was difficult to follow the chapters at first with every other chaper going backward in the charecters past and the other going forward into her future. But the concept of a hidden ancient language playing out in current day gardens and bouquets was very facinating to me. It made me re-evaluate my own tiny garden and buy more plants to express what atmosphere I wanted to surround myself in. I also had to rethink my own flower selection for my upcoming wedding. So overall it was a winner & I highly suggest it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book! The roller coaster ride of life!  Truly a curve ball of a story intricately weaved. Can't wait to read another of Loans Moriarty's books!
B005F2BBLK|4.0|I'm a sucker for Johnny Depp and movies with a message.  You never get too old to appreciate creative minds and being entertained by novel ideas.
B0083EM24C|4.0|It's very passion pit but also has some difference and change. So it doesn't feel like listen the same album as the previous one
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its soooooooooo awesome and fluffy and despicable I love love love love love love it. I recommend this for those who like despicable me
B000I3SYEI|4.0|If you want to read a Star Trek movie, this one will please you.  Had it contained a bit more information that tied it into the rest of the Star Trek verse, I would have given it a 5-Star.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I like to play games and UNO is a game I play at home. I was unhappy to see that I could not play the game as easily as it could be on the Kindle Fire. It seems like I have to have stars or gifts or something in order to play. I do not like having to pay for things that I do not want. I may not play this game on Kindle Fire because of how it is now set up. I will go somewhere were I can play and have fun playing the game. The first round that I played was fun. But that was the only time it did not require something else.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|J.J. Abrams is to be praised for this strong addition to the Star Trek verse.  And the actors have moved into their characters beautifully.  There were many times that I had to shake my head to remember that I was not watching Shatner or Nimoy.  Abrams relied upon all of the television series, not merely writing a new story but rather tying all of them together.<br /><br />If you weren't thrilled with his first movie, do not hesitate to watch this one.  While I found the first movie a bit incongruous, as a confirmed Trekkie, I truly enjoyed this one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I found Temple run 2 to be an engaging, fun, and overall enjoyable experience. Sliding feels satisfying and jumping is as precise as ever. The strategic plate placement of coins makes it so that if you want all of the coins, you have to work for them. I give this game a 4\5... would play.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Story line was boring after a while.<br />The chemistry between the actors was not good. Very mediocre movie. I thought it would be better?😕
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another great book, worthy of 100 stars. To all you people who rated it 1 star: You obviously haven't read the series, or you wouldn't rate i like that. I hav been reading rick for forever. He's amazing. The ending…Oh MY GODS I NEED HOUSE OF HADES!!!!! I've waited almost a year! Great book, get the whole series.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Why do people walk the long walks? For some it's love of nature, for others personal challenge, for some it's a kind of magical thinking- a feeling that somehow something will change if they can only do this one hard thing. Cheryl Strayed did that one hard thing, and her life did change.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I saw the 3 hour TV special and just had to order the DVD.  The Eagles are one of my favorite bands and this show sent me to their concert I had been wanting to see for 35 years.  The history of the Eagles told by the Eagles themselves.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Finally got this in the mail. I purchased it on Amazon right after the movie was no longer in the movie theatres. For eleven bucks, i thought it was a good deal. This star trek movie has been in the stores for a few weeks already. Sure it cost more in the stores, but if you can't wait, buying it on Amazon may not be the way to go.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is a bit too crowded for me.  I find it frustrating not being able to rotate the buildings.  Or, did I miss something? I don't recall the tutorial going through that step.  I, also don't like the city credit barrior that constantly picks at your pocket for more money.
193700788X|5.0|Arrived early which is great since I couldn't wait to read this book after the last one.  Was in great condition.  Some big changes that I didn't expect.  Great read.  Love the book series as much as the show but started watching the show first.  My suggestion if you are hard core fan one way or the other is to enjoy them for what they are separately.  Both are great in my opinion.
B007CKNX28|5.0|I love Jack White.  The album is fantastic.  Amazon, maybe not so much.  I never received the Autorip version of this.  Would love to have it available digitally as well!
B0094K1PW4|3.0|Super 8 was predictable, and never really grabbed our attention.  Even my 12 year old, who I thought would really like it, said it was just okay and that he wouldn't watch it again.  A big drawback for me was most of the scenes were in dark settings - at night, in a cave, etc.  That is a real turn off for me.  If you have nothing better available, sure, give it a watch and form your own opinion.  However, I would not say it is a must see movie.  Just my $0.02.
B00E8K2I9Y|5.0|Oh, right, it's Richard D. James' music resonating inside my skull.<br /><br />I feel that art criticism says more about the critic than the art in question. It is entertaining to discuss the merits of various artists at parties and social events. In a product review, you have no way of knowing whether our musical interests line up. So go over to youtube and find some of the tracks on this album. Or any of Richard D. James' other work. If you don't know his work yet, you will soon know if you love it or hate it. If you love it, and you own a turntable, then you should buy this album. If you don't, then move along.<br /><br />Practically, this is a fine pressing of Selected Ambient Works 85 - 92. You get two vinyl records in a nice cardboard sleeve. Both sides of each record has tracks pressed into them. As a physical artifact, there is nothing particularly exceptional here, but there are also no problems. If you have previously purchased vinyl, you will get exactly what you expect. If you have not, then rest assured that this is a good quality pressing that is worth your hard-earned dollars.<br /><br />If you believe that vinyl is a waste of your time and money, then please feel free to pass this record up. There are plenty of us, however delusional, who enjoy throwing our money at such frivolous items. Please let us enjoy our illusions in peace.
B00DYVESVO|4.0|Pretty much all action. not a deep narrative, but its fun to see hulk wreck up the place. Not as strong a story as planet hulk.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Someone called director Steven Soderbergh \\"the best hack director ever.\\" After seeing this it's easy to see why.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Emily (Rooney Mara) is finally reuniting with her husband (Channing Tatum) who's been in prison for four years on insider trading. Past issues of loneliness and vulnerability creep up on her so she sees a shrink (Jude Law) who treats her and proscribes a string of pharmaceuticals. These cause further problems for her including sleepwalking. During one episode she stabs her husband to death. She skates the charge on an insanity plea, but the incident also causes problems for Jude, and as he digs deeper the entire incident takes on a whole new color.<br /><br />I like these kinds of movies. It kept me guessing very close to the end. At a certain point I knew what might happen, but I wanted to know how they would pull it off. Some liken it to a Hitchcock mystery/thriller and they're right. This does start out (as many have noted) as an indictment on the psychiatric/pharmaceutical communities, then changes to thriller gear. I loved the way the story unfolded and how Jude began to put the pieces together. Then they add the note regarding Emily's previous shrink (Catherine Zeta Jones), and Jude's sinking further into a near helpless situation, and I was really hooked. As in the best of Hitchcock, the viewer wants (needs) to see the innocent guy claw his way out of the web.<br /><br />Now for the directing. Soderbergh isn't a flashy director, but this was efficient. I always thought he had the camera in the right place and he seemed to know how to set up one shot to transition into the next. I also liked the color palette. It was a pretty movie with colors being not too washed out nor over-saturated. The performances were good, as was the editing and music. I had a few minor quibbles, and I'm guessing a second viewing would reveal some plot holes, but this had me hook, line and sinker.<br /><br />For those looking for a good brain tease, this is a doozy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! If you like temple run and like the minions you will love this game the only bad thing is that you have to spend your tokens to change locations
1423113462|5.0|Book Review<br />The Lost Hero<br />By Rick Riordan<br />This book is full of Greek and Roman mythology, gods, and demigods. It also has lots of titans, monsters, and giants. It is just too epic for words, and I thought I was a Percy Jackson fan all this time.<br />This book takes place in the U.S.A and camp half-blood, a camp for demigods (children of gods) run by a centaur (half man, half horse) named Chiron and has lots of cabins for demigods, masked by a force called the mist, which makes people not able to see it.<br />The characters in this book are: Jason, an amnesiac that calls the gods by their roman names, Piper, a girl who has not seen her movie star dad for days, and Leo, who is very good with tools and fire that is always pranking everyone.<br />I can't wait to read the next book. This book is so amazing.<br />-Written by my son Sammy - age 9
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I wondered what all the &#34;fuss&#34; was about and now understand the following this series has. In many ways, Downton Abbey is the British &#34;Sopranos&#34;.  People stuck with trying to preserve a way of life that is quickly passing them by.  Performances by Maggie Smith and others just epitomize what acting should be.  Enjoy!
0470876417|4.0|The book arrived very quickly. I've only gone the first chapter, but I like the material and the layout - very easy to digest.
B000LC55F2|5.0|Great movie, buy it, buy it, buy it. I think I could watch it multiple times and not get tired of it.
0156027321|5.0|This book came in in a very reasonable time! It was packed carefully. It is a great book, including a lot of descriptive adventures.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I am not usually a fan of books from the male perspective but this book changed that opinion! Don't put it on your list of books to read...read it now!!!
B00004ZAV3|4.0|All these cuts being #1 on the billboard etc. charts shows how the Lennon-McCartney duo were constantly trying new avenues and held nothing back when writing!
B003TOMAPC|5.0|I love this movie. It has comedy and action which is a good combination. It original too. I would rent it again.
B003YNFYD8|5.0|The Lennon-McCartney genius came out in the later recordings with the lyrics taking the upper hand from the background music.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|It said it was free and then when i ran out of money it gave me the prompts to pay with real dollars - the game is not free so i feel that your company is lying.<br /><br />So what are you going to do about this false advertising??????

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Great book.  Made me challenge assumptions of what it takes succeed in sales.<br /><br />Definitely a must read.<br /><br />Who knew?  Highly recommend .
B0025KVLRO|3.0|I purchased this album because I couldn't find &#34;Do you want to know a secret&#34; on any of their other recordings?
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I decided to read this because I knew the film would be coming out soon.  I like to read the book before seeing the film when possible.<br /><br />Having &#34;Death&#34; be the narrator gave a unique aspect to the book.  Other books will tell of the horrors of the Holocaust, but this book lets you into the life of a small village and how WWII affected the residents.  The heroine may seem implausibly precocious, but I feel she is credible as a talented outlier.  The book is fascinating and the tension holds throughout.<br /><br />I would recommend this book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Performs like it should. Cant go wrong with real sony controllers. None of that knockoff crap!! Exactly like the one i got with my playstation
B005K8QIS0|5.0|We are always on the lookout for good mystery series, and they don't seem to come out fast enough (Lewis, Endeavor, Midsommer, etc.), so when the reviews were so good for Case Histories on Amazon, we took a chance.  Glad we did as we really enjoyed it.  Have spent a lot of time in Scotland, so that adds to it for us as well.  Love the characters and the story lines.  We will keep watching these!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Read this as a girl and was curious if the story held up after all these years. Still a beautiful story with a million layers. Highly recommend.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Great movie! One of my all time favorites. The first 20 minutes or so and the rest of the movie feels almost like two different movies. Great setup, and finish!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|glad they made light hearted romantic comedy for the older generation.  it's sweet and uplifting. this is not oscar material or anything.  but definitely worth your time.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty is one hour and fifteen minutes and was released in theaters on January 29, 1959. The story is that an evil witch named Maleficent put a curse on King Stefan and Queen Leah infant child named Aurora. The curse was that Aurora would prick her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel before the sun set on her sixteenth birthday. The three good fairies disguised as mortal take her to a cottage in the woods where she grew up and went by the name Briar Rose. Since this is a Disney movie we now the rest of the story and the happy ending. This was the first Disney movie filmed in 70mm format or what we would call today wide screen. This would be the last Disney movie inked by hand. From 101 Dalmatians on, every animated movie would be were xeroxed onto the cels. On last fact about Sleeping Beauty at the time it was the most expensive movie to make at a cost of six million dollars.<br /><br />My biggest beef about this two DVD set is the overkill of information. In Disc 2 the Games, Music, & Fun is fun for kids but when you the History & Behind the Scene (mostly geared to adults) is too much information. It took me over two hours to go through that whole thing and after watching no more of five minutes of The Peter Tchaikovsky Story I turned the special off. Just see below look below at what you get. I cannot imagine a parent going to her daughter and saying \\"hey little girlie lets watch all of disk two\\". The poor girl would wind up committed in a mental sanatorium.

B003UYUP58|4.0|Would have liked a more positive ending to this non-fiction book; at the same time, I appreciated the author's no-nonsence approach.  Overall, I now have a much better understanding of cancer, and I am grateful for that.  I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family.
B005FDW7AI|4.0|Beautiful story line even for me who has no children. I would have given it a 5 but at times it was a bit unrealistic, even for a kid. But all in all one of those feel good movies that makes the heart smile with a happy ending :)
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this lighthearted comedic novel. It was interesting to read from the point of view of a person with Aspberger Syndrome. It's not often I read romance novels but this was our book group choice for the month and I'm glad I did. It would be good to see what they do to it for the<br />Film version. Would recommend it to anyone who would like a good chuckle. He's quite a loveable character.
B008G59IBI|4.0|It's hard to top American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown.  Overall, strong effort.  Not the bombastic rocker like the a fore mentioned, but the final song is a keeper.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|The sixth entry in the now long running franchise suffers from a few bad old action cliches and a few new ones too. It's almost like the series has turned into an Ocean's 11 type all-star ensemble cast event, each character bringing their own element be it comic relief (Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris) the tough guy (Vin Diesel, The Rock) or the 'good' guy (Paul Walker). Two parts action one part comedy and Dwayne Johnson, who will always be the wrestler to me, is still overplaying his role as the ultimate badass cop.<br /><br />We get it, you're big, you've done steroids for a decade and you can bully and fake your way through a movie, good for you. The scene when you immediately realize this, is when Hobbs decides to 'question' a man in detainment, when he's done it looks like the Incredible Hulk has just had his way with the room. I don't think we've ever seen Vin Diesel in a humanistic role in this series or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Obviously this movie wasn't made to be realistic, but all the jumping off cars through the air and stuff is a little ridiculous if you ask me, I'm not watching a fantasy film, something has to be grounded in reality. What this movie has always been able to do well however, is set a mood. Ever since the first film they have known how to play the right songs, show the right girls and pick the right cars. And when you couple that, with some of the action sequences in the film it is a great stylized experience, though of course that does not make up for the lack of substance.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|A clever idea.  The writing style is OK, but I am a detective novel enthusiast, and the tale in this tome just didn't do it for me.

B000MKD9P6|5.0|This is a show I watch on a quiet day at home. I recommend it to those looking for a show with a character who finds out who she is.
B001BR5NH6|4.0|a classic 80's flick with all the right stuff. teenage craziness, parties, sex, drama, love, fights, and a mixed bag of a plot! what more could you ask for from an 80's classic!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Great series. I highly recommend this show for anyone who likes to watch horror shows and movies. One of my favorites!
B00F35BV64|3.0|The story line and plot and acting were amazing! The picture and sound... let's just say i should of gotten HD. I really didn't think that  getting just the regular quality would have looked and sounded so bad. Oh well, I guess I know from here on out.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Beautiful, evocative, sexy, intelligent music - that I have come to expect from Janelle Monae.<br />This is equivalent to &#34;double&#34; album - simply amazes me how much love and hard work went into its creation!<br />Buy the album, you won't be disappointed!
B0000549B0|5.0|Jimmy Stewart is one of the greats. Harvey is a one-of-a-kind classic. If you can get your hands on this hard-to-find movie DO IT. The subject is original and the script is well written. They don't make 'em like this anymore. Great movie and no distracting foul language.
0385528787|4.0|My rating is 4.5 stars actually.<br /><br />First, like many reviewers, I found this to be a \\"can't put down\\" satisfying conclusion to the Ms. Atwood's dystopian trilogy.  The book answers (or provides a pathway to answers) to a variety of questions left over from \\"The Year of the Flood\\" such as - is there a future for the rag-tag, remnants of the old humanity?  How close are we (old humanity) to Crake / Glenn's new people?  And just how smart and dangerous are the Pigoons?<br />But Margaret Atwood is not just about substance and great story telling, she's a \\"writer's, writer\\" and a stylish one at that.<br /><br />Look for the shifting narrative voices and individual perspectives as the story unfolds and is told in bits and pieces going from Zeb's perspective to Toby's to the Craker's.  All of these characters are successful but I would say that Toby is one of the most fully developed characters I've encountered in recent memory.  Atwood makes us feel what she feels and reminds us that even through a monumental disaster, humans are humans  - they will love, they will be petty and jealous and also amazing brave, kind and caring all at once.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very fine piece of work that I highly recommend.  For those who have not yet read \\"Oryx and Crake\\" and the \\"Year of the Flood\\", I would start with these two books to truly appreciate and understand Maddaddam, although, in my view, if you only have time to read \\"The Year of the Flood\\" you will get enough of the backstory to make Maddaddam a satisfying volume.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good movie of you like sci fi. Not quite as predictable as some reviews indicated. Great visually.  I'm not a tom cruise fan but I like this movie.
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|I liked it. It was very interesting and different to other movies. I liked the visual effects a lot. all in all was a good watch
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill and Paul Franklin did a superb job at capturing the essence of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens.  It's a very nice tribute to these two heroes of classic country!
B0055OK2T0|2.0|I watched this movie based on all of the positive reviews on Amazon.  Mainstream media wasn't as kind.  For once, I agree with media on this one.  I thought it was a poor man's Inception.  Not as good as Inception but tried to be as creative.  Last 30 minutes is the best.  Maybe it requires a second viewing but I'd rather not.  There wasn't enough there to get me interested.  I'm disappointed because I wanted to like it--maybe you will.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It's a lot like bejewelled blitz which I was addicted to and so far I like this and the pop ups you do get are like most other apps I get.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|The bag was everything it was described to be.<br />The only downside was that it was a bit smaller than I had anticipated.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I have watched this movie three times since it first came out.  It is action packed and the whole idea that one person can kick the butts of multiple villains is exciting.  This movie is great fun to watch.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I LOVED IT ITS AWSOME ITS EASY AND JUST AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think is super easy super fun you will love it
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I love Liam Neeson's acting and usually the movies he starts in.  This one is so bad and I surprised that he decided to take the role.  It started out to be promising but quickly turned grisly and just plain annoying.  The unrealistic looking wolves who kept tearing people apart were pathetic and the bloody remains of people gruesome to see.  I won't go into more detail about the movie in case you like long, boring movies and want to try suffering through this one.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This movie is as enjoyable as you would expect with this cast. It's well done and has some funny lines. Of course the plot would never work in real life, but there you go.
B000HAB4KS|3.0|The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was pretty good.  The second time through I sat and wondered why on earth I ever thought it was good.  It could appeal to many people though and might not be a waste of a buck or two.
B009E3EY38|3.0|Since the overwhelming majority of reviewers have praised this reunion gig as nothing short of the second coming, I thought I would throw in what some of the disappointments in this concert are.<br />Note that I also think the concert was a success and lived up to (almost) every expectation. These reunion gigs are disasters waiting to happen, but Zeppelin showed that with enough time to rehearse they can still pull it off. Please don't interpret this review as dislike of the band, but I want to try and point out some of the negative things to try and add some balance. Hopefully someone will find it helpful. Through out the review I will be comparing it to another successful reunion from 2005, Cream.<br /><br />1) Jimmy Page then and now.<br />  I think the biggest problem is that Jimmy Page, the mastermind, lead guitarist and overall dominant member of Led Zeppelin just isn't quite as good as he used to be. This wouldn't be a problem if he wasn't trying to be. His approach is the same as it was in the 70's, but he isn't the same guitarist he was back then, so the reaction is somewhere between \\"Wow, it's cool to see/hear Page playing this solo again\\" and \\"Why is he still playing the same kind of solo for song X that he did in 1973?\\" For example, take the solo on Black Dog. The version from this reunion gig is just an abridged form of the solos he did in the 70's. Well, those of us who have the bootlegs have heard that solo a billion times. The only exception to this is the never-before-performed \\"For Your Life,\\" where Jimmy's solo, while effective, doesn't compare to the kind of things he would have done in the 70's. So the listener is left with mild frustration that Jimmy isn't playing new kinds of solos, because the feeling is that they could never match what he did back in the day.<br />  It seems that Jimmy knows this, since on the DVD you can see that he pays more attention to his left hand while playing even slower runs, and his guitar is highly distorted. Those of us in the know (read: guitar players) can tell you that distortion isn't just a cool sound, it also tends to mask mistakes. While Jimmy's guitar isn't distorted to the point of annoyance, it leaves a slightly bad taste in my mouth. Jimmy was never known as a remarkably clean guitarist, but I don't think he can plow through his staccato phrasing with sheer gusto like he used to. He needed to smooth out his sound a bit, and since his hands aren't as limber as they used to be, the solution is to add just enough distortion to cover it up. Nowhere is this more evident than in \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" (the song as performed on \\"Celebration Day,\\" not the film), where Page doesn't have the swift hybrid picking skills that he used to, and the distortion just makes the ringing guitar sound like a mess.<br /><br />2) The improvising band.<br />  \\"Led Zeppelin is one of the most spontaneous bands to ever exist!\\" is something you might hear from a standard Zeppelin fan. \\"It was different every night\\" is something you'd hear from the members when reminiscing about the old days. But was it really? Every version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\"--the band's staple improvisation number--circa 1972 onward would be structured almost exactly the same. It would gradually expand until by '75 it clocked in at just over 35 mins., but what I mean is that the \\"Mars, Bringer of War\\" section (for example) was something you could reliably expect to show up in every performance from '72 on. Zeppelin was not quite as spontaneous as they tell everyone they were, and it shows in \\"Celebration Day,\\" where much of the \\"improvised\\" material is simply the same stuff they did back in the day--and it wasn't all that spontaneous back then! Again, contrast this with the Cream reunion, where the solos Clapton plays on (say) \\"We're Going Wrong\\" are nothing like the solos he did in '67 on that song, and are different from night to night (Cream did five reunion gigs, Zeppelin did one). To be even more damning, contrast this with Cream in the 60's, where you often couldn't even tell which song they were in if you started in the middle of the jam sessions. THAT'S improvisation. But to a fairly knowledgeable Zeppelin fan, it's clear as day and night. Don't misunderstand me. Zeppelin had their spontaneous moments, but the band, and their fans, tend to really over state it.<br />  The result, for Zeppelin, is that \\"Celebration Day\\" ends up sounding like a very well rehearsed, very well through out, very structured gig. Zeppelin in the old days weren't all that spontaneous, but they weren't well practiced either, so the music did sound a bit loose even if everyone knew where they were going next. Again, contrast this with the Cream reunion which sounds more organic on the whole. The Cream reunion doesn't hide behind volume or power. The musicianship of the three members is on display, and nothing else. The Zeppelin reunion feels like it's hiding it's rough edges behind sheer bravado. Typical Zeppelin? Yes, but the guys are in their 60's now--to hell with bravado. The most exciting part of the Zeppelin reunion is when they nearly crash towards the end of \\"Dazed and Confused.\\"<br /><br />Last note: Before \\"Trampled Underfoot,\\" Plant makes an oblique reference to the plagiarism that Zeppelin is now infamous for (that is, recording other people's songs and CLAIMING THAT THEY WROTE THEM). Not quite sure hat to make of this.<br /><br />The Zeppelin reunion was great, but flawed. I guess that inevitable. I just don't want prospective buyers getting too caught up in the hype generated from the over enthusiastic fan base.<br /><br />Now I'll wait for the variations on, \\"Let's see you do it!\\" and \\"You're and idiot\\" that the mindless among the Zeppelin fandom will hurl at me like so many hairballs, convinced they are bullets.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|A lot of the criticism that Into Darkness seemed to get was that it didn't follow Roddenberry's \\"utopian\\" future, exploration driven story lines, that classic TOS exposed.  This claim is bogus for two main reasons, that I see anyway...  One...if you don't believe that it didn't adhere to the exploration mantra, did you not hear the numerous lines about how the Enterprise was about to be sent out on its 5-year mission?  They're getting around to it, OK?  Either in the next movie or in a potential TV series.  So they go side-tracked by the whole Khan thing...give'em a break.  Yeah, OK, and maybe the taunting of the Klingon Empire to start a Interstellar War.<br /><br />And two, the idea that Star Trek isn't about conflict, war, or just having to deal with a really bad guy, and a corrupt Starfleet Admiral, is just being disingenuous as there have been MANY Star Trek episode/movies that have dealt with similar themes.  And this business whether one action was moral or ethical (as per that conversation between Scotty and Kirk) was a bit ridiculous, as I couldn't even follow the logic in that discussion.  And I'm a logical thinking guy.  Because the way I saw most of the moral dilemmas in this film all had to deal with the age ol' Vulcan Proverb of \\"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\\"  It was all about the question of whet someone will do to save their best friend or their crew.  And if you put saving your friend over everything else, the rest of the moral dilemmas in the film make much more sense.  So I had no problem with all the moral decisions in this movie.  You do whatcha gotta do.<br /><br />War with the Klingons?  Hell, yeah!  Bring it on!  I hope Trek 3 will continue on with a potential War with the Klingons....just as long as they leave out something about a Genesis Planet...know what I mean?  Just start off the 5-year mission as you would expect, and then being called into action by Starfleet by an incursion into the Neutral Zone by the Klingons.<br /><br />All that being said, I thought Into Darkness was a good film, not a great film, but a solidly good film.  I give it a 4.5 stars.  The only thing that it really needed little more space stuff, although it had more than I thought it would given some of the other reviews I've read.  What it did lack was Enterprise fighting back.  She was so beat up by sabotage and the Vengeance blasting her to bits, that she didn't have a change to fire phasers or torpedoes.ns.<br /><br />All that being said, I thought Into Darkness was a good film, not a great film, but a solidly good film.

B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awsome and good for any1 whose bored from age 6 to 600 i have always liked minecraft and now that they finally added it to kindle fire im so happy and the one star reviews can go and throw a pitty party somewhere else
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game.  Very addictive and great to play for all ages.  Would highly recommend for anyone.  The minimum face expressions just adds that much more entertaining.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Mike Connelly provides the reader with a taste of three different stories.<br />While they are each different, they provide the reader with a good sample of what he has written previously, and what we may have to look forward to in the future.<br />Any of the stories could have been expanded into individual novels, that had compelling stories and interesting characters.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is a Michael Connelly fan, as well as to those who are interested in a sample of his story telling.<br />The only drawback, the stories were too short.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Effective performances from a strong cast but the plot seemed a little too unbelievable for me.<br />Overall it was a good rental.
B00F3B7IH4|5.0|This double CD is amazing. I am so pleased that I bought this release; I've only listened to her music as it played on the radio which was scarce (south). I tell ya, the 2nd track on the 1st disc blew my hair back; she and Prince! Wow! I viewed the credits b/c I thought maybe \\"your majesty\\" Prince wrote a few lines but nope, all Janelle; as is the case on the whole CD. Then, hearing her and Ms Badu on track #3 which I heard by watching the video on youtube but it sounds so much better following the 2nd track, Givin Em What They Love.<br />The 2nd disk is no disappointment either. I've been playing Suite IV and V in my car for 3 days now. I just turned Pandora back on today; day 4(on way to work). I'm seriously going to checkout her last 2 CD's, may be I missed something.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is so riveting! Great performances from everyone and a fascinating story that keeps you hooked episode after episode.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I saw part 2 when it came out w/o seeing this first. I loved part 2 and so did my kids. This movie is great also. The shipping came faster than expected and that's always a good thing!!
0142410314|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2D6PNF7D4S21A]]This review is from Dean Goranites of the BookReviewersClub.<br /><br />\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is a children's story revolving around a poor boy named Charlie Bucket.  Charlie was from a very poor family that lives near a chocolate factory.  One day, an announcement goes out that five people will get an once-in-a-lifetime chance to win a lifetime supply of chocolate. When he actually ends up with a winning ticket into the competition, he goes with a whole lot of excitement.  What follows is a whole bunch of misadventures in this candy factory.<br /><br />This book is about the dreams of one boy. All in all, he gave the book 5 stars because the story really touches the heart.
1617751588|5.0|great art, super funny.  if you have cats, you will love it.<br />i think there are two more that are just as good
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars II is amazing! I was surprised how great this game is! You get new powers, new levels, new birds, and more! A must-have for Star Wars and Angry Birds fans!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|Tried it on several bottles.<br />It scores the bottle ok, but we were never able to get a clean break of the glass.<br />We tried pouring hot then cold water over the score.<br />We tried holding the bottle over a candle flame, then over cold water.<br />We tried tying a string soaked in nail polish remover and set it aflame... none of the methods worked.<br />We were never able to get a clean break.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game for all ages. easy levels. like all games though some in game items cost to much. they want you to spend real money. just once like to find a fun cool game where your game coins would buy anything.
B003R50AW8|4.0|A very entertaining read! Thoroughly enjoyable in a way that leaves you dying to read more and more every day. Not incredible but very very good.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I think Mel Brooks summed it up in his brilliant animated short The Critic:<br />\\"It must be some symbolism... I think it's symbolic of junk.\\"<br />I checked Prometheus out from the library. It was worth every penny I paid for it.
159463176X|4.0|This is not the best of Hosseini's books, but the description of brother/sister relationships is very compelling.  It's  better than a reality show.
B00915G6MG|5.0|It's everything I expected it to be. Will probably buy more seasons down the road,am a big NCIS fan anyway.
B000LPS4BG|3.0|It's a great movie, but I'd recommend just saving a couple dollars and getting DvD version.  The Blu Ray is not a very good transfer as seen on my well regarded plasma tv.  I was expecting more for a Blu ray transfer and it just didn't impress.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|addictive fun. I. loved the movies and this game just gives you more of the minions that people go to the movies for!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|great game. fun to play and no pop ups. the down part is you need money for extra things which run low quick.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|If you liked the original songs chances are you'll enjoy this EP with the bands own twist. Very well done and just a lot of fun.
B00C9U9YLA|5.0|The album itself is fantastic, and having it on vinyl just makes it that much better.<br /><br />The fidelity of the record brings out a lot of sounds that you will miss out on if you're listening through MP3 or CD. The songs have so much feeling, and the sound on this really brings it out excellently.
B001AFF25W|5.0|The book outlines important concepts required for the individual that wants to own, address and go beyond the problem of procastination. Highly recommended
