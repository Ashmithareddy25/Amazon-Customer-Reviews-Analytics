1451648537|2.0|I suspect that people read biographies of famous people not to get clues to their talent, but to simply note some similarities, however slight, with events in their own (less famous, talented) lives.      This gives us some validation of our mistakes and imperfections in our world view or personal history.  If Steve Jobs, who changed the world, couldnt stand nonsense or suffer common fools, well then, why should I?     Walter Isaacson's biography may help for this goal - it seems to be nothing more than a chronological accoutn of every little thing that happened to a fellow named Steve Jobs, every little anecdote, however unconnected or irrelevant, is recounted.     OK, OK, aside from his unparalleled genius Mr. Jobs was a jerk and a jackass,  but do we need to get a list of every person who noted this.  OK, OK, so he occasionally was given to great humanity and compassion (and uncontrollable crying), but do we need to keep reading EVERY instance that Isaacson had this in his notes.      Why is it important to note, for example,  that even though Steve Jobs went on crazy diets he was open to his non-fruitarian daughter ordering chicken at a restaurant - just means that Steve Jobs was occasionally given to common sense!  I almost expected to read that despite his 'reality distortion field' Steve Jobs was known to use the bathroom as much as any other person!    A biography doesnt need to be complete archive of everything said in every interview with or about Steve Jobs.   Isaacson may have be Chief Editor of Time magazine, but he is poor writer and clearly needs a good editor here.  The prose is terrible in  places: \\"One day Atkinson burst in to Texaco Towers all excited\\", among many examples.     This book does almost nothing to provide a narrative which links the tangible and intangible facts of Mr. Jobs life to give us a glimpse of a remarkable man who, literally, defined the modern era. (No, it was not all about being adopted,  the 60s counterculture and droppingacid).  Isaacson does not understand technology enough to see what was important about Steve Job's monumental legacy in it.   Never in the  history of human innovation was so much owed by so many to so few -    the Entire World was changed like never befor by a few geniuses in the 'Valley of Heart's Delight'  for 50 years beginning in 1955  (yes, I am stealing the phrase from Churchill's description of the Battle of Britain).          'Steve Jobs' is not a total waste of time - you do get a huge catalog  of intriguing  anecdotes and some history of Silicon Valley during 70s,80s and more recently, when Apple, Google, Facebook  and restore Silicon Valley as the world's greatest creative region.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot. I play on the HTC incredible 2 and I have had no problems of any kind. A simple premise, but very addictive. I bought this game a couple months ago and I still play it, which is more than I can say for most of the games I get. If you see this for free on amazon, GET IT!
B004LROUNG|5.0|With The Litigators, Grisham is back with a story that is reminiscent of his very early works that brought him to prominence.  While some of his the works that followed his early classics have been formulaic and, at times, plodding and preachy, the Litigators is comparable to his early legal thrillers. The book started quickly with the near nervous breakdown of David Zinc, an overworked attorney at a huge law firm in Chicago.  Zinc finds himself with a new perspective on the legal profession after landing at a small firm run by two sketchy lawyers who are the antithesis of the big firm Zinc is trying to put out of  his mind.  As the story unfolds, the pages fly by.  The plot is believable, the characters feel real, and the conclusion is satisfying.  This was a thoroughly entertaining novel.  Here's hoping that the next few works from Grisham are every bit as good as this one.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I have played this game almost daily for months now, it's addictive. Each time you beat it you unlock new difficulty modes. The controls are customizable allowing you to change thier size and position. There are tons of characters, levels and achievements to unlock. If the game is laggy just turn off the game feed under settings. This game is a must have, well worth the money! The dev rolls out HUGE updates regularly.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|I purchased this at a local store after looking and looking for a cover that I liked for my Kindle Fire.  It fits snugly inside the cover and it doesn't seem overly tight.  The first few days I had the cover, it didn't close completely-the top of it stayed open just a bit.  Now it rests on top of the Fire perfectly so I guess it's stretched out a bit.  As other reviewers have said, it is a very attractive design and color-very unique.  It's also very sturdy-not flimsy at all-it seems well made and constructed.  I don't think that it's worth $40.00 but none of the covers I looked at seemed to be worth the asking price.
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|The bad new: it's a dark version of the Goonies without most of the fun. The good news: my cousin got it from OnDemand. I didn't spend a dime on this movie, yay!   Super 8 borrows from Aliens, the Goonies, ET, the directing style of Jaws or most older Spielberg movies, and the Blob.  It's not the worst movie but definitely not worth any of the hype and the preview was much better than most of the movie.  I rent movies from Netflix before I buy since 3D Blu-rays can be more expensive.  For some reason Hollywood seems to think that a better image, sound, or 3D make up for bad movies...they don't.  Also, don't buy the first edition of anything, there is always an \\"Extended\\", \\"Super\\", \\"Ultimate\\", \\"Collectors\\" version of whatever movie at some point.  I used to do it but I'm sick of the double, triple dipping...hear me Disney and your \\"Ultimate\\", \\"Platinum\\", \\"Gold\\", \\"Silver\\", \\"Special Anniversary\\" 3D, DVD ,Blu-ray versions of all of your movies. I will no longer buy anything from any distributor until it's been out for at least a year. Even them I will buy one version of your movie and no more.   Oh, and flixster.com sucks! If you give me a digital version of a movie, don't make visit a new site or make me register for a new service. I already have one and don't care about all of the other services.
0553582011|1.0|PROLOGUE<br /><br />He awoke to the warmth of sunlight on his face. At last the day had come. He stretched to work out the kinks in his joints and muscles and groaned at the throbbing in his head. On his nightstand lay a bottle of Dornish red, which he downed in one long swallow to clear his mind, wine dribbling down his beard and tunic. He spied the book at the corner of his room where he had hurled it, and nearly threw the bottle too as the rage resurfaced along with his senses.<br /><br />The book was called A Dance with Dragons, a book that he had vowed to write a review for to publish on Amazon.com. The ending had left him dazed and confused the night before, and he longed to leech the foulness from his blood in the form of a scathing review to warn others of the horrifying tedium that awaited them. But first...<br /><br />His bladder was full to burst, and he propelled himself to the privy to relieve himself of his heavy load. A steaming stream shot from his hose like the boiling vomit of a sick dragon; far more than what he had anticipated. He counted five and ten seconds gone by as he continued to shoot and spurt, and when it ended he sighed in satisfaction. He shook off the last drops and pulled up his smallclothes, mission accomplished, but what was this...<br /><br />His tummy rumbled.<br /><br />A dragon's roar erupted from his hind quarters, a sound that bellowed like the wet cheeks of thunder itself. The smell was revolting, and flakes of brown and bubbling slime oozed down his legs like gravy.<br /><br />&#34;Farts are wind.&#34; He chuckled, saliva running down his beard and undershirt<br />CHAPTER 1<br /><br />He opened his refrigerator to check its contents. He was hungry, and he was not going to write his review until he was full and sated. Much and more can be done in a day, and he wasn't about to rush himself.<br /><br />Within were foods beyond count and description, but he was going to try anyway. Two cartons of eggs sat at the top shelf, each carton containing sixteen shells filled with delicious yolk and white. On the shelf below there were meats of every kind: ham and beef and pork, bacon and roast beef and steak, enough to make his mouth water and his stomach jiggle with hunger winds. Yogurts dominated the third shelf of at least three different brands and ten different flavors. Orange juice, apple juice, grape juice, juice of every fruit and flavor. He would not go thirsty, mayhaps. There were also cakes of cheese and chocolate and strawberry short, as well as pies of apple and custard for when he tired of cake. Winter may come, but he would not go hungry. The bottom shelves were for vegetables, cabbages and carrots, broccoli and lettuce, tomatoes and...what...<br /><br />&#34;Neeps? What the hell are neeps?&#34; He shrugged.<br /><br />He broke his fast on fried neeps and bacon, scooping them up in week old hard bread that he hollowed out and used as a trencher. He tipped the delicious soup into his mouth, bits of neep and bacon grease running down his chin and robe. When that was done he ate the trencher too, the soggy crumbs clinging to his facial hair. He mopped up the excess grease with his beard, saving it for future consumption. If there was anything he hated more than procrastination, it was wastefulness.<br /><br />His review was in his mind. He yearned to write it, as that was his true purpose and he despised these bothersome distractions! But first, he had to travel. Surely there was plenty of time. Much and more can be done in a day, after all. Much and more.<br /><br />CHAPTER FIVE<br /><br />The ship sailed down the river.<br /><br />In truth, he was not on a ship, nor was he in a river. But he had always longed to go sailing, and if he could, he would write about it incessantly and without restraint. But as of now, he drove a car, and while there was no river, there was a road, a long strip of gray asphalt that continued on to the vast horizon, leading to his destination, wherever that would be, and oh the Seven only knew when he would get there. The cement was cracked and the paint that divided it chipped and faded, mayhaps from age and use. The buildings passed by in a vague blur, but he could not pay attention to them now. He had to look ahead, or risk getting lost at sea. If I look left I am lost.<br /><br />Like the outstretched hand of a giant, a red light loomed before him, forcing him to stop in his tracks. There were three lights in all, red and orange and green. They played in sequence, herding the ships about like kings in an ocean court. He wanted to push on past that oppressive red god, but he knew to do so would be a one way ticket to the black cells. And the jail was dark and full of terrors.<br /><br />He could not afford to risk that, to be held captive for the tenth time like some onion smuggler. He had a review to write, and no time to waste. But he would get there, he assured himself. He only had to sail - drive - thrice more. But first comes the setup, and then he would put his pieces to play.<br /><br />CHAPTER THIRTY<br /><br />&#34;Good morning, sir. It's good to see you again!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Hello, wench.&#34; He greeted. On the counter was an assortment of goods and food products. He had enumerated them in excruciating detail the chapter before, but he saw no reason not to do so again. Packs of lunchables were stacked like a mountain of prepared meals to lazily break his fasts on on the counter before him. Jugs of milk stood next to them, flanked by bags of cookies and crackers in varying brands and flavors. And oh R'hllord the cheese! Sliced cheese, round cheese, white cheese, blue cheese, string cheese and cream cheese. New pieces of hardbread were grouped to the side, of which he would use as trenchers when they become old and tough as rocks. And-<br /><br />&#34;That would be thirty-six fifty, sir.&#34;, said the wench.<br /><br />&#34;What?&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Thirty six fifty. I rang them up while you were describing them. I like to pretend we're racing. I always win though.&#34; She smiled.<br /><br />&#34;Ah, I see.&#34; His eyes squinted at her, as if seeing her for the first time. Her hair was the color of straw and flowed past her shoulders and held in a band with a cute lion face (LANNISTER!) so as not to be obtrusive, culminating in a widow's peak at her hairline. Her eyes were like brown m&m's swimming in puddles of fresh milk. She wore a white blouse slashed with yellow with the top two buttons open. Her bosom was impressive, and on the left was a nametag.<br /><br />&#34;Darianne. Oh Darianne! How have I not noticed you before!&#34;, he crooned.<br /><br />&#34;Um...I don't know. We see eachother everyday...you like to describe your purchases while I-&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Silence! Don't speak! You have awakened the dragon, and oh how he roars. I wish to sit for ten chapters straight and repeat your name! Darianne! Darianne! Darianne! And please, call me nuncle!&#34; Suddenly he shook his head, and his eyes focusing and his gut retracting, as if waking up from a terrible spell. &#34;No, I must not! I have a review to write, and these random romantic dalliances will only waste time!&#34; But as if succumbing to an invisible force that filled with extreme laziness, his eyes glossed over and his stomach spilled over his belt, and once again he was lost. &#34;Please, take me through your Myrish swamp!&#34;<br /><br />&#34;...&#34;<br /><br />CHAPTER 52 - 88<br /><br />&#34;Go Giants!&#34;<br /><br />CHAPTER 89<br /><br />It had been a long day, longer than the longest of books, longer than even the longest installments of the most epic of epic sagas. There had been many distractions along the way (through no fault of mine!), many foods to enumerate and much sailing - driving - to do, and he was contented to immerse himself in all of it. But the end had come at last; there was no more time for those distractions. It was time for the climax, and he must needs go with a bang. If there was actually anyone waiting, this was the moment they were waiting for.<br /><br />He sat in his chair, facing the computer screen, ready to write his review. The time was twelve and twenty, his cheek still stinging from the slap Darianne had given him, and his fingers flexed and ached to at last express what he felt after reading A Dance with Dragons. He glanced at the mirror hanging at his side, and for a fraction of a second he glimpsed the face of a rotund old man with a snowy white beard wearing a newsboy hat and an NFL jersey, who somehow reminded him of a greedy Santa. He shook his head. He must be weary from lack of writing.<br /><br />His fingers twitched over the keyboard, eyes glued forward at the screen. There was no shirking it now. The end would have to come. No more excuses. It was the end of the road. The final countdown. Duh duh DUHduh, duhduh duhduhDUH! The &#34;setup&#34; was complete, and his characters waited in place, ready to make their moves. This was the moment he had spent an entire day and one thousand figurative pages preparing for.

B005TTEFRG|4.0|BE WARNED: This version has no extras, aside from the digital copy, which comes with two featurettes.  The Blu Ray 3D version has commentaries and other featurettes, so decide whether you want to pay the extra $3 for it.  As for the movie, it's a lean, mean, savage beast--just like Howard's original character.  I saw it in theaters, and as a Conan fan, my complaints were minor.  I'm actually mystified by the many, many bitterly disappointed reviews.  Though it does not follow the stories, it takes minimal liberties with Conan's origin, and captures the spirit of the character and the world very well.  Fans of the stories will see many of the elements that Howard himself loved to feature in his stories--all-powerful, evil villains, wall to wall action, dramatic locations, and beautiful women.  This movie is a shot of pure barbaric action, straight up.
B00020HEG6|3.0|John Williams is my favorite movie score writer.  He's superb!    But this last one, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a little less than his usual.    The main theme throughout is taken from Shakespeare (must have been one muggle they liked) and a kid's chorus sings \\"Bubble Bubble Toil and Trouble\\".  Their voices almost sound phony for some reason.  Can't put my finger on it.    Some of the theme is beautiful, especially Hedwig's, which I love.  Well, we all do.

B005YDLJ76|4.0|I viewed the standard concert-only edition offered at Wal-mart and on-line for a limited time the beginning of the week before receiving the Deluxe in the mail from Amazon, and overall I must say it's nice for the price no matter which version you buy.  The cinematography was excellent and you get the feel of the venue and the intamacy everyone behind the production was intentionally trying to create.  Her voice was top notch where it counted, but to see her not necessarily at her best and vulnerable vocally especially given her pregnancy (which you will see support early reports back when the show started after watching this) was to be admired because she knocked that show out with style, grace, and glamour like only she could.  She just can do no wrong.  Period.<br /><br />Off the top as the show begins to progress, you notice that it is being set up like the Vegas \\"I Am...Yours\\" one week stand back two years ago with the dialogue and script.  Thank God it changes when she begins to do the songs from \\"4.\\"  Technically, like another reviewer mentioned, the editing and special effects on some of the songs like \\"Countdown\\" and the fact that various clips from her career and personal movies were mixed in with the songs can be a little jarring, but hey...she's clearly not going to tour in 2011 and who knows what 2012 holds, so this is your best bet.  I myself was one of the lucky fans who snapped tickets up to this show when they went on sale and waited outside in the cold rain for 3-plus hours before the doors opened almost 2 hours after the intended start on the tickets, so for me it did hold a bit of sentimental value attending the first night and having to wait for this once in a life time opportunity.  The DVD producers clearly wanted to play on that.  However, it's quite clear that the DVD presentation is a culmination of all 4 nights as the stars such as Betsey Johnson and Lady Gaga didn't come until subsequent nights, some noticeable wardrobe issues, and the fact that the night I was there the young guy didn't give her the painting he made of her.  And though she performed the songs in order save for \\"Start Over,\\" they are out of order here which I don't quite understand but it is what it is.  I would've preferred them in order since the album builds track after track emotionally, and to see her sing it in that order, you really get the true power of \\"4.\\"<br /><br />As for the features on this Deluxe Edition, on Disc One \\"Roseland: Behind the Scenes\\" serves more like a 7-minute trailer than really an in-depth look into the show.  Alot of the footage was featured at the show as teasers on the screens before it began.  Disc Two's \\"Beyonce: Behind the Camera\\" is a little more what the Disc One featurette lacks as it appears like a documentary chronicling the behind the scenes of the album and videos.  Much better piece and highlights Beyonce's newfound passion as producer and director.

Completely over indulgent, I couldn't event hum along to these melodies. I hope she matures out of the \\"give-em-all-I-got\\" stage soon - I love her smooth tones and clear voice, but its not present on this album. She screeches, rifts, and gravelly moans her way through the ruination of every Christmas song I love - Just a bad album!
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|The first thing that strikes you about the Invicta Men's 1512 I Force Collection Chronograph Strap Watch is it's size. This is not a watch for diminutive people. In the infamous words of the character Bean, it is large. It even looks large on their own diagram of a human arm included in the picture set here on Amazon. At some point, large watches apparently were popular with a certain segment of society and Invicta was there to supply the demand. Personally, I find that it's much larger than necessary, but perhaps the race set has a \\"bigger is better' mentality or they simply wanted a very small clock. It comes in a very nice leatherette case in bright Invicta yellow and a booklet is inside to help the owner come to terms with it's various time-keeping functions.<br /><br />And this is where a bit of confusion sets in.<br /><br />The manual in question has instructions for their entire line of watches. Figuring out which watch you have and the functionality of it per the manual is a bit tricky. Invicta manufactures a plethora of watches with various 2-position crowns and all are included in this one manual. This particular watch's crown has two positions, the first is for setting the date and the second is for setting the time. It took me a few minutes with a magnifying glass to figure out what was actually happening on the watch's face in both positions. (Note: Even more confusion set in after going to the Invicta website and trying to locate this specific watch for it's manual. Entering in the model number resulted in nothing coming up.) There is also a stopwatch which can be used to time various events and the wearer can use buttons on either side of the crown to start and stop the action while watching the milliseconds, seconds and minutes accumulate on three separate dials. The figures are also handily luminescent once the watch is exposed to at least a few minutes of bright light and you can dive in up to 330 feet of water without damaging the watch, but seriously, why would you want to wear this beautiful watch while diving when they make much less expensive diver's watches for just that purpose? Perhaps if you are pushed off the dock at a yacht party, it's nice to know that while your tux may be a bit fishy afterwards, your watch will still work like new.<br /><br />It is a seriously beautiful watch offered at a huge discount. But in this age of cell phones and computers, the known time is all around us and I'm afraid that there will come a day (video screens and internet connections on a watch withstanding) when we'll see the death of the watch as a time keeping device. That said, I'll only wear this to special engagements where I'm sure I'll receive approving nods and glances throughout the evening.u want to wear this beautiful watch while diving when they make much less expensive diver's watches for just that purpose?

B005IZLPMY|3.0|I had heard nothing but good things about this movie. In fact, I heard it was one of the best movies this year. Of course we hear that about a lot of different movies but the weird thing with this movie is that I hadn't heard really anything negative about it at all. So I went into this expecting a lot and came out kinda \\"meh\\".  The plot is decent at best. It's entirely predictable but that's not the problem to me. The problem is that it's just kinda the same thing we've seen over and over. There really isn't anything different that stands out to me, besides the beginning and the end. Sure it was entertaining at times but more times than not I would ask \\"Really?\\" Whether Captain America was doing song and dance (one scene) or mysteriously comes out alive of certain situations, it just kinda left me blase.   This isn't a terrible movie by any stretch of the imagination but it wasn't amazing to me. The main actor is really good and was fun to watch.
B0041KKYGA|4.0|I was getting far too comfortable seeing Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, Pirate Radio, The Replacements) playing shaggy, directionless buffoons.  FINALLY he has received a strong lead giving a command performance as the Earl of Oxford.  In this compelling period piece it is he, and not the otherwise famed name, who actually penned the works of William Shakespeare.  Growing up in a noble household in which poetry and theater are analogous with sin, he finds himself the recipient of voices, rich with prosaic observations of life, which plague him until they are inked to parchment.  The products of which are the works of Shakespeare.<br /><br /> This comes to pass as the Earl bribes a mediocre playwright (Ben Johnson, played by Sebation Armesto) to claim his plays as his own.  However, when the time comes to assume credit before his invigorated audience, Johnson hesitates.  Opportunistically, William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall), a desperate actor in the play privy to Johnson's secret deal, steps forward and assumes the role.  What ensues is a web of political deception and betrayal, littered with twists which culminate in a tale more tragic than \\"Shakespeare\\" himself ever penned.  While I'd love to explain how, I'm NO SPOILER.<br /><br /> Online reviews of Anonymous vary wildly in ratings from \\"amazing\\" to \\"boring.\\"  While I advocate that my opinion is unique to any other and we all have our preferences, I have difficulty understanding how anyone but an ill-educated child could possibly find this \\"boring\\" unless we're confusing \\"boring\\" with plotty or \\"I didn't like it.\\"  In defense of other aspects of this film, the set design and cinematography (occasionally CGI-enhanced) didn't quite receive the budget it deserved.  At first, this was disappointing.  However, as I watched on, I appreciated how the budget was used and enjoyed shots of poverty-stricken cityscapes and aerial views of gross architecture.  I get it--these sets are expensive.  It is also worth mentioning that I did not enjoy the characters of William Shakespeare and Ben Johnson.  These characters do little more than serve humbly as the spoon delivering the castor oil that is the \\"truth\\" of the plot.  I won't rule out that they could have been written considerably better, but this movie is more about the Earl of Oxford, political subterfuge, and his secret.  It's not about the over-the-top, illiterate William Shakespeare.  In fact, the least tragic element of this movie was Shakespeare's fraud.<br /><br /> My defense of these flaws clearly identifies my stance on the movie.  I liked it a lot--really, I loved it.  Rhys Ifans has never failed to entertain me, but has never entertained me like this.  The Earl is strong yet desperate, vulnerable with respect to his work yet callous to his wife and civic responsibilities, and deeply methodical yet inconsiderate of consequence.  The Earl is the object of political and romantic turns which drive the story forward, and he is well-complemented by the Queen (played young and old by Joely Richardson of Nip/Tuck and Vanessa Redgrave, respectively) and the manipulative Cecils (played by David Thewlis and Edward Hogg).<br /><br /> By the way, the ending...very heavy, very touching, very real.

034552554X|5.0|There are so many things I want to say about this book, but all that comes to mind is WOW.  The story was perfectly crafted and set up so that, by the end, I was holding my breath for every character in the book.  The author ties everyone together so perfectly that you know them all, inside and out.  Diffenbaugh's writing style is beautiful and straightforward, which made reading very enjoyable.  Being with Victoria as she grew painfully into adulthood and confronted her past was a pleasurably exhausting and emotional journey that left me sobbing at the end.  The way that flowers became a part of the story as much as the people was interesting and very well done.  I loved the way Victoria used flowers to communicate all of the hurt and angry feelings she had about herself, but found a way to use them as a tool for bringing joy and happiness to others.  This book will leave you heartbroken and hopeful at the same time and you will feel a real sense of loss when you finish reading the last page.

0066620996|5.0|Wao! What a book it is. I knew about this book for quite some time but finally I bought it late last year and received in January 2011 alongwith START WITH WHY. I read this book last month. And I am simply bowled out with the content. Everything made sense to me. I am not part of big business like the ones mentioned in book, but the philosophy and principals mentioned in book are all relevant and can be implemented any where and in any business, if ones like to follow the path mentioned in the book. There are no short cuts and implementing a philosophy requires lots of thought and resolve. His next book \\"Great by Choice\\" came just last month and is on my agenda for reading.
0062011847|5.0|Snuff (2011) is the thirty-fifth Fantasy novel in the Discworld series, following [[ASIN:0061161705 Unseen Academicals]].  The initial work in this series is [[ASIN:0061020710 The Color of Magic]].  In the previous volume, Glenda met Pepe backstage in the Shatta.  Hex made a ball suitable for the game of football.  Juliet got her picture on the front page of The Times.  The Librarian rose out of nowhere and stopped the ball dead in mid air.  Juliet made a couple of dozen pies.  Three bird women accosted Nutt and Glenda screamed.  In this novel, Sam Vines is the Duke of Ankh-Morpork, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, and Blackboard Monitor.  He is also the husband of Sybil.  Sam was the hero of Koom Valley, where he brought Trolls and Dwarves to the peace table.  Sybil Ramkin is Sam's wife.  She has definite opinions about his diet  She also wants him to take a vacation.  Havelock Vetinari is the Tyrant of Ankh-Morpork.  He always has a plan and probably knows more about you than you do.  He agrees with Sybil about a vacation for Sam.  Carrot is a Captain in the City Watch.  He is also a dwarf by adoption.   Fred Colon is a Sargeant in the City Watch.  He and Nobby have been in the Watch longer than Commander Vimes.  Nobby Nobbs is a Constable in the City Watch.  He and Fred are crooked, lazy and lucky.  None know the species of Nobby, including his mother.  Felicity Beedle is a young lady dwelling in the village,  She is the author of several books that have greatly influenced Young Sam.  In this story, Sam has been forced to take a vacation, leaving Captain Carrot in charge of the Watch.  Sybil, Young Sam and himself travel by coach to Ramkin Hall, AKA Crubdells.  Although it is technically a one day journey, they stop at an inn and arrive on the following day.  Sam shakes hands with the gardener and then greets the butler and chief housekeeper.  Sybil points out his errors.  Afterward, they enter the house and eventually go to bed.  The bed is so large that he has to search for Sybil.  Sam has never been exposed to so much quiet.  But the nighttime has its own, unknown sounds.  Sam finally gets to sleep, but two maids bring breakfast at dawn.  Sam wanders down to the Goblin Head -- the local pub -- and gets a nonalcoholic drink.  The publican is a retired cop from the Pseudopolis City Watch.  Sam also buys alcoholic drinks for some of the clientele.  Sam runs into Lord Rust in the village.  The general has retired in the area and has a few words to say to the Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch.  Fortunately Sam has to return to the Hall and listen to Young Sam read a book about poo.  Meanwhile, in Ankh-Morpork, Sargeant Colon and Constable Nobbs drop by Fred's favorite snuff shop to replenish his supply.  The owner throws in a cigar with the snuff.  When Colon squeezes it next to his ear, the stogy screams at him.  The cigar has a tiny goblin pot in the tobacco leaves.  This tale involves Sam in the death of a goblin.  Since goblins are officially vermin, he is stretching the case to consider the killing as murder.  Since the Watch includes a variety of sapients, Sam considers any being that can carry on a conversation with him as a person.  In the pursuit of this case, Sam meets an angry blacksmith, the local constable, his son's favorite author and many goblins.  Sybil is initially upset with Sam for finding police work in the countryside, but she understands that crime is everywhere.  Young Sam displays many traits that might make him an excellent natural philosopher.  The next installment in this series has not yet been announced on Amazon.  Highly recommended for Pratchett fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of small villages, various magics, and tangled romance.  Read and enjoy!  -Arthur W. Jordin

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this cover and put my Fire in it immediately (they arrived together).  It hasn't been out since.  I like that the case holds the Fire very securely and the elastic strap holds the cover either over the screen or behind the unit to keep it out of the way.  The only thing you have to be careful of is if you have the cover folded to support the Fire as a stand.  Make sure it's entirely in the groove or it may slip out.  Overall a very well designed cover with adequate protection.  I'd recommend it.
0446547654|2.0|I have loved many of Nicholas Sparks' books, even though many were melodramatic tearjerkers. \\"The Best of Me\\" takes melodramatic to a whole new level of predictability.  I know he isn't known for happy endings, but seriously?  The ending was predictable within the last 40 pages and I found myself just wanting to get it over with.  I have cried while reading everyone of his previous books, but I did not shed a tear over this sad attempt at literature.  If you must read this love story about 40-somethings Dawson and Amanda, and how their love will never die, then get it from the library and save your money.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is a fun, addicting, simple and yet complex game. The premise of the game is very simple. The controls are equally simple. Despite the simplicity of the game, some complexity is introduced through leveling up and distributing points into skills. This game is perfect for a 5 minute gaming session when time permits.  Most importantly, it is Xperia Play Optimized!

B005TZFZJC|5.0|First, I LOVE the reviews that say \\" she is kiddie oriented\\" or uses that demographic.  Obviously they have NOT heard any of her previous albums, watched the news, or listen to the radio.  I mean really, her contribution to Eminem's \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" and her own \\"S&M\\" kind of squash that theory flat.<br /><br />The timing of the album is perfect. The Christmas Season is here, and her major \\"competition\\" for sales is waiting for next year, (Lady Gaga, Katy Perry..et al) so it should do rather well.<br /><br />In This album, she continues to mix her Euro-Pop Synth influence with her edgy R&B. Don't forget that she was in the middle of the Euro-Pop (trance/Dance/Electro) movement in bringing the style from Europe, (David Guetta's \\"Who's That Chick\\", \\"Only Girl In The World\\") and her newest smash \\"We Found Love\\" and \\"Where Have You Been\\" on this CD are examples. \\"You Da One\\" has hit written all over it. \\"Cockiness\\" is well...a triple x  S & M song. It makes you wonder what her and Chris Brown were REALLY doing. \\"Talk That Talk\\" with Jay-Z (Also a contributor to \\"Umbrella\\" is vintage Rihanna, another great song.  \\"We All Want love\\" is more of a heavy slow anthem. \\"Watch & Learn\\" is also a great song, with a great hook.<br /><br />The extended edition if very good, the added songs do not break stride, with \\"Fool In Love\\" being a great anthem song, and \\"Do Ya Thang\\" being another good Rhianna R&B.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is an excellent Rihanna album that will not dissapoint. There are at LEAST 4 huge singles here and will not disapoint. Yea, do NOT listen to \\"Cockiness\\" with anyone under 18 nearbye. Even a radio friendly version of the song would be hard to explain to a Bieber Fan. When People complain, do they listen to Pink, Lily Allen, Eminem, \\"Forget You's\\" original version, just about any Hip Hop?<br /><br />Like others have mentioned, is there growth here? I would say some, just as much as the other major artists out there. Basically, there ain't a clunker in the bunch. Based on her body of work, with this album added, her concerts must be spectacular.<br /><br />A good album, worth the money, and if a Rihanna fan, you will continue to be.ith this album added, her concerts must be spectacular.

B005GVA2L0|3.0|First of all, I'm not a big fan to begin with but I bought this for my husband who is. The CD is okay, but all the songs sound the same. My 8 year old son made the comment once \\"why are we listening to the same song again\\"...and it was a different song. Also, I don't feel like they utilized her voice to its full potential. Just thought I'd throw my two cents in.

0385534639|1.0|For me this book was 387 pages of tedious, overwritten, treacly descriptions of what promised to be a magical world.  The characters are completely flat, the dialog is trite and amateurish, and if there is a plot, it's an illusion to me.  The book promises a \\"competition\\" between lovers; I can't think of one example where they went head to head in such a manner.  I quickly became bored with the theatrics and constant descriptions of spectacles.   I forced myself to finish this overblown and silly novel and agree with all the \\"one star\\" reviewers here.  I regret that I spent time and money on this book and, once again, fell victim to the publishing hype.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great way to watch the movie. Too bad it didn't include a second season of Firefly on the disk. =)
B006BSMY36|5.0|After the last episode, I was worried. Worried that the writing was going downhill. Well that is surely not the case, as this gem was beautifully crafted from the script to the acting to the production, with some very effective techniques used to illustrate Kate's PTSD symptoms. This episode picked up the \\"Kate was shot\\" thread again, and joined up neatly with the sniper terrorizing the city. Can't say anything negative about it, and the evidence locker scene with Javi was particularly spot on. Nice climax with Javi as well, having Kate's back doing his snipery thing. Very little humor here, but the episode didn't suffer for it -- it was appropriate. Captain, sir [sic], you weren't even too annoying. And c'mon, who doesn't love Michael Dorn?

This for the Little Monsters or lovers of electo-house style music. But one things for sure. I will definitely be getting my $9.99 out of this album :)
B002NT3B52|2.0|I'm a dog lover and an animal advocate in my local community. I also have a BS in Physchology and MS in Educational Psychology. I've long been interested in animal behavior, both in humans and dogs! So, I was really looking forward to reading this book as I felt it was a good fit for me. Upon reading this book, I felt like I was back in college, reading cognitive psychology textbooks saturated with scientific research and terminology. Although I agree the book should be based on scientific research, I felt it could have been written in a more reader-friendly way. It wasn't hard for me to follow the book but, I haven't even finished the book because I found it to be incredibly boring and painful to read. All in all, I was disappointed.
0375703764|2.0|House of Leaves is incredibly repetitive and long-winded. The author has no idea how to make characters that readers connect with, and a good 20% of the text in this novel isn't even worth reading. A large amount of this book is just words for the sake of words.

8186336141|5.0|Whether you are a beginner or advanced practitioner, this is the book (APMB) you would want to keep with you for lifetime. I have read BKS Iyengar's \\"Light On yoga\\" and Swami Ramdev's (Swami Ramdev has created yoga revolution in India) \\"Pranayama Its Philosophy & Practice\\", but this books tops the list. Make no mistake both BKS Iyengar and Swami Ramdev are master of yoga but Swami Satyananda Sarswasti's way of writing, comprehensive view of yoga practices and flow of the book makes APMB the best yoga book. APMB book lists contra-indications, benefits and variations of asanas and pranayamas. Swami Satyanand Sarswati is one of the initial yoga gurus who have conducted scientific research on yoga. When you are reading this book, you realize that this is a creation of a yoga genius.  Along with review of book, just wanted to share my experience with yoga practice - I was introduced to yoga (much like many other people in India) because of the yoga awareness created by Swami Ramdev. Swami Ramdev has conducted extensive medical research on effects of pranayama and he has documented many evidence where people are cured of many diseases by practicing his 7-step pranayama(see Swami Ramdev's Pantajali Yogpeeth - Divya Yoga Mandir website for documented evidences). I started practicing Swami Ramdev's 7-step pranayama program (Swami Ramdev emphasizes greatly on Kapalbhati(skull shining) and Anulom-Vilom(altenate nostril breathing) pranayama). I wanted to be more serious with yoga practice and I started practicing Vinyasa yoga in local yoga studio. What I realized over the period of time is that best yoga practice is the one which combines both Asanas and Pranayamas. In the US, many yoga studios focus mainly on asanas (vinyasa being popular style) and there is less emphasis on pranayama. Swami Ramdev emphasizes mainly on pranayams and talks less about asanas (he does have a separate book dedicated to asanas but he emphasizes mainly on 7-step pranayama). In my experience combining both in your yoga practice is the best way to go. Before you start pranayama, if you practice basic asanas (such as Sukshma Vyayama, Surya Namaskar, Naukasana, Vajrasana, Dhanurasana, Halasana, Sarvangasana etc) you experience much more concentration during pranayama. I found that Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation) is the best and complete exercise to relax muscles, loosen joint and hence the best exercise to prepare for more advanced asanas, pranayams.   Hope this help!
B003WTE886|5.0|The incredible thing about Ms. Taylor is that her albums are pure platinum.  Every one of her songs is at least very good and several are awesome.  She's the only artist that I can listen to for three albums straight and end up wanting more.  She saves the best for last in this album.  Have to wait another two years for her next album unfortunately, but the wait i'm sure will be worth it.
1451627289|4.0|I have a feeling this book will do very well for Mr. King as it's very mainstream & this book is likely to interest non-Stephen King fans. I knew very little about JFK & this era so this was a good excuse for me to find out more. I must give kudos for King for coming up with a great idea & making you feel as if you really are in the 1960's. Finally the ending is very well done. Even though I definitely recommend this book I feel there were some slow spots & that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|1.0|Cards are too small. They have lots of wasted screen space. Why not make the cards bigger so I can play? Also, the ads are really annoying. They pop up out of nowhere and trick you into clicking on them. If you like solitaire look elsewhere. There are other ones in the App Store with more variety, features, and larger cards.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Having a hard shell case is a good idea for a Kindle Fire as it feels pretty dense and I'm sure dropping it and cracking a case is much less expensive than the Fire. However, I got this really for the built in \\"stand\\" that it has for the cover. the cover is pretty nice in itself but the stand doesn't really work as described/depicted. It's too flimsy to really hold it up and the edge slips out too easily. Compared to the others out there (mostly without the stand) this is probably the best one but I was hoping for a bit more for 30 dollars. It's really a 15 dollar case to be honest and hence the 3 star rating.
B004LWZW4W|1.0|While the story keeps us in our seat for 90 minutes, the advent of CGI has become the scourge of modern cinema. There's one thing that even the greatest make-up artists and computer geeks have never mastered and that is apes...or any animal for that matter. As I suspected from the trailer, this was in fact a blur of moderate CGI effects in every shot, that had me screaming for Roddy McDowall to return. If hundreds of monkeys overran a city..they'd be shot on sight. Easy! The inherent lack of any adequate quick reaction force in an American city after the break-out ruined the effect for me. It just wouldn't happen on horse-back with batons.   What ever happened to the classic movies of the 70s and 80s that even today have us queuing up to buy the Blu-Ray? I doubt this film will stand the test of time and I won't be eagerly awaiting the Blu-Ray. A watch once affair.
B000MV8ZD6|2.0|I just don't get it.<br /><br />No one who's read any of my reviews can accuse me of not appreciating low-budget, badly acted, crazy no-sense plots, poor dubbing, and awful special effects for what they are, and for making huge allowances for the time the film was created as well as its cultural differences.  And anyone who's read my reviews also knows that I revere Lucio Fulci's [[ASIN:B0002C9DK4 Zombie]] as a great horror classic.  But of the two films by the same director that are part of the so-called Gates of Hell trilogy that I've seen ([[ASIN:6305840024 City of the Living Dead]] and 'The House by the Cemetery'), I just don't see their appeal.<br /><br />Aside from the many red herrings and unresolved sub-plots, the story isn't too difficult, even though it ends awkwardly.  Essentially, a family moves into a house previously occupied by an academic professor doing research on suicide.  Due to some enormous strain, the professor has succumbed to the idea of suicide and taken his own life; the family that moves in is headed by the professor's partner, who is going to take over the research.  Almost immediately, the mother begins noticing strange occurances around the house, and her young boy is visited by a girl that no one else ever sees.  The menace threatening the family takes on more stridant overtones as the film progresses, and in the end, they must confront the history behind the house if they wish to escape the fates of those that came before them.<br /><br />The problem I had with the film is that I just never thought it established any sense of atmospheric dread due to its many flaws.  Other reviewers have no doubt commented on the excrutiating dubbing job for the young boy, Bob, as well as the plot holes and ambigious ending.  I could easily look past these faults, but there must be something, some unusual aspect - or unusually well-done techniques - to elevate the entire production.  Throwing scenes of gore and dismemberment at the audience has its charms, I suppose, but I think that has to be at the service of the story, not the other way around.<br /><br />There are many avid fans of this film - and anyone who enjoys Italian horror from the late 70's and early 80's should probably make the effort to see this one as well since it conforms to all the highs and lows of that particular genre.  I will say this for it - it isn't very predictable, but its unpredictability comes through in such convoluted ways that it's more of a distraction than a favorable quality.  If I had to rate this one against 'City of the Living Dead', I would probably give the edge to 'House by the Cemetery', though it would be close.  Both films have a moment or two that are effective - 'House', perhaps, coming closer to sustaining a level of interest due to its plot containing a bit more mystery.<br /><br />But with both of these films, there should be some temporizing against too many rave reviews.  Whether or not some viewers find value here shouldn't cloud the fact that by no stretch of the imagination are these 'good' films.  They are what they are, which may also happen to be right up someone's alley, though most casual viewers are apt to dislike them - highly.  Previous experience with this type of film is the best guide, though I have to admit that, while I fully expected to find at least some positives, I was, for the most part, disappointed,

The beats get stuck in your head and gives you a nice feeling. Funny, peaceful, sad, evil, releasing, groovy... I bet you can find a song for every feeling and mood.  Maynard sings both beautyfully, haunting and in a funny way. This cd is like breathing fresh air, it feels like freedom!  I checked out the previous release too, V is for vagina, and it is doing the same thing to me, I am starting to love every single tune on that cd too.  These two albums made me listen to Tool and A perfect circle in a totally different way, I get so much more out of their music now. Puscifer adds a different dimension to music. Good job!
0553801473|2.0|This read is somewhat unsatisfying, when compared to the first 3 novels in the series.<br /><br />This book took 6 years to write, which indicates that R.R. may have lost some interest in this project, and it shows in some of the writing.<br /><br />Let me say though, in fairness, that despite the general negativity, it was still good to be re-acquainted once more with the characters and world of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />On the general writing however, some appears to have been done in haste, and some appears to have been written with the screen-play in mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writing is no longer high-art, but more like fantasy pulp-fiction.<br /><br />Some of the character motivations are a little bewildering, as is the meandering plot in parts, and I personally do not greatly enthuse to writing that attempts to iterate sounds (or other senses), such as \\"whooosh....whoosh....whooosh...\\" to describe a dragon flying.<br /><br />I am not sure where Ice and Fire can go from here. I expect the motivation for the next book may come when (or if) the television series reaches book 6.

B004UIOUHC|5.0|I use opera on my Droid at home on my laptop and at work on my desktop. It syncs between ask three systems seamlessly. I loved using chrome but switched to opera because it works better and is faster on the desktop and not having to remember passwords and having my opening page with shortcuts to all my favorite sites is a huge time saver. By far my favorite Android app, I use it every day.
B000002UDG|4.0|Recognizing McCartney's musical genius over the past 5 decades is a moot point.  Few artists have achieved such deserving acclaim as Sir Paul.<br />Thus 17 track collection celebrates most of his solo/Wings endeavors of the 70s/80s and are outstanding examples of his incomparable musical diversity.<br />Often denigrated by Beatles purists, McCartney was accused of selling out or going too commercial, claiming John Lennon was truly the genius behind the Fab Four.  True?  Who cares?  Most of these songs are great recordings and prime proof of McCartney's skill not only as a composer but as a crafted musician.<br />Of these tracks, I never cared much for his duets with Wonder and Jackson, or the pretentious C MOON.  However, the remaining songs are classic McCartney.  ALL THE BEST demonstrates the impact of his generation's finest composer.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|So first of all, Drake is Drake. This is his 2nd major release and he has quite a few lesser known releases from a few years ago. Anyone who claims to be a hip hop head and then gets mad that this cd isn't as hip hop as they expected, then what can i tell you? Well, i could tell you that you're simply not a hip hop head. Anyone who knows anything about hip hop can tell you off the bat that yes, Drake can spit, but that isn't his only talent and he isn't interested in making a rap album.  Most of his songs feature him singing whether on auto tune or with some other kind of voice enhancement. I've seen him in concert and can tell you that he's not a very good singer without the digital help. But lucky for us, he (like most of today's r&b acts) is smart enough to use these enhancements on the cd.  He isn't a thug, he isn't from the streets, and he isn't a battle rapper or a free styler. However, too many people are interested in comparing him based on those attributes instead of just laying back and listening to this cd.    You know who you are so i'll stop there.  As far as this cd goes, it's real addicting, mainly because of the hooks and the beats. The beats are top notch. Production is so solid and goes perfect with Drake. The guest spots for the most part are solid too, except for the last few bars from nicki minaj.    I really like this cd but i'm gonna compare it to his previous works, simply because while Drake has definitely matured in his last couple of cd's, he has a certain sound that sticks with him throughout.  And it's easier to compare this cd with his previous cd's instead of comparing him to wu-tang, biggie, or some ridiculous sh* like that.   As far as the full cd comparison/rating goes, gotta say that the beats on this one completely murder his previous cd's. And the way he strings the songs along as far as sounding unstructured but not unfocused, it's all perfect. Best beats are Crew Love, Cameras, The Real Her.  Lyrically, this cd is probably hisworst. (not bad at all, but not as good as his last two) He sounds a lot more bitter and sad on this one than his previous two, and definitely not as creative.  So Far Gone you could tell he was optimistic.  Thank Me Later he was about living it up with his fame. Now on Take Care, he's about addressing the haters.  And don't get me wrong, i love revenge and he does it well (especially on Take a Shot For Me = masterpiece).  But what happened to the party songs where you just hear that track and you think wow i want to feel that good about my life too?  Drake isn't even talking good about women anymore. \\"Shut it Down\\" from Thank Me Later was such a great song for the women. \\"Fancy\\" showed his appreciation for women who get it themselves while still beign a bangin track.  This cd has none of that.  All the songs about women are really like breakup songs and revenge songs, or telling a girl hey you gotta deal with my problem so either deal with it or don't. And all of the party songs have some touch of rubbing it in to the people hating on the sidelines.  I agree with many reviewers here who think that the young money crew is bringing Drake down. The track HYFR was unnecessary.  It's real sloppy and sounds more like a mix tape track.  Real weak hook that has nothing to do with the verses, which may be common for many rappers but definitely not Drake. With Drake, I expect the hook, bridge, verses, all to tell the same story. HYFR is just all over the place, doesn't make sense to me.  The Rick Ross guest spot wasn't bad but I don't think it added anything to that song. Seemed just like a spot to advertise for Rick Ross. Same with Nicki Minaj's last few lines on her song. Weak.   I disagree with a lot of reviewers on here when it come to the song \\"Practice\\". I love this song, think it's a good way to remix a classic. I like the message on here, it's really the only positive song he has on here towards women, well it is in comparison to the rest of this cd.   The happiest song on this cd is probably the most emo track, which is the one with his mom on it, which is trendy right now for rappers to do, but he pulls it off well.  Right now i'm jamming to this cd mainly for the beats and the mood. When I want more lyrical drizzy, i'll throw Thank Me Later or So Far Gone in the deck. I don't see this cd being a classic like a lot of you do, sorry. I just know how old I am and throughout time, you get to realize that most artists only have one or two classic cd's and the rest you can appreciate but you will skip over when you're in the mood to hear that artist. In 20 years, we won't be reaching for this cd, we'll be reaching for So Far Gone probably.  There are definitely exceptions to that rule, but this cd is not one of them.  Good, even Great cd here. But no classic. 4 stars.
B004SBX112|1.0|NOTE:  I own all the Angry Birds games and ROVIO has RUINED them all with SPYWARE.  They have recently issued new Updates for all of them that change the modest 2 PERMISSIONS to 11 so they CAN SPY ON YOUR DEVICE!<br /><br />I also have had many CRASHES with all 5 Angry Bird games as well as their Amazing Alex and BAD PIGGIES apps.  I repeatedly reported all the problems to ROVIO in the past year and they always send you FORM LETTERS but never FIX ANY PROBLEMS.  Many people have reported these Graphics Anomalies and Crashing problems so ROVIO is well aware of issues but does Nothing to Fix them.  Now they just want to SPY on US to MAKE MORE MONEY.<br /><br />NOTE:  The Developer Description at the end of their app pages on Amazon has ROVIO saying they are Expanding their ACTIVITIES INTO MARKETING SERVICES, etc.  Obviously they have changed into a MONEY MONGER Company.<br /><br />ALL 7 OF THEIR APPS CRASH PERIODICALLY, NOW INSTALL SPYWARE ON YOUR DEVICE AND THEY WON'T FIX PROBLEMS.  I will NEVER TRUST THEM again and will Remove all 7 ROVIO apps that I paid for.  STAY AWAY!!!!!
0061120081|5.0|Not only did I have to read this book in high school (way back in 2002 during my sophomore year), but since then I sometimes goes back to it to read certain parts once in a blue moon. Even if that means just hitting up the CliffNotes version, I still go back to this book. I even own the movie on DVD and have seen my own cousins perform this play at her high school about 4 1/2 years ago.<br /><br />This book may not be for everyone. One reason is because of the pace. I don't mind a book that goes slow as long as the writing is modernized a little and the plot makes some kind of sense by the end of the story. Oh and as long as there is no greek tragedy sequence that makes me want to poke my own eyes out and ring my own brain through some bleach to get the images out of my head (MacBeth! YIKES! lol) than I'm willing to read some of the classics.<br /><br />Beyond the main theme of acceptance, the book was written in a time when racial segregation was still happening in the deep south. Black people couldn't use anything a white person used in public and so many other horrible things Jim Crowe Law's did to any black person was a horrible reminded of our nation. But this book makes you believe in justice and the heart of the story that comes to fruition from some of the characters.<br /><br />All in all, this book is a treasured piece in my library. My own children someday will be reading this book. I'm hoping before they get to high school so that they can have a better understanding of life in general and learn to accept everyone for who they are and not what they are... which is the message of the story as well.
B003UESJEW|1.0|First and formost the vendor of this product shipped on time and was very helpful with the problem with the Player.  I can tell you this will be my last Sony purchase.  The vendor credited the entire cost back to my account ***** (Five stars for the vendor).<br /><br />The Blue Ray loads and then starts the previews but whan it reached the main menu it freezes when you click Play it to play the video.  Thank you this is just what we need is more copy protected junk on the market.  I can't review the movie obviously because I could not watch it.  I will not play on My PC with power DVD.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I  love this chip since it works well and is pretty fast. But the main reason why I got this chip is for value and simplicity. I switched to AMD after being left behind in the wake of Intel's numerous platform changes. AMD offerd a predicable upgrade path meaning that I would not have to buy a whole new computer if i want to upgrade. And they did this for lower coast than Intel. However I cannot recomend this chip for new system builds as AMD's new platform is out. Get the new chip. But dont worry any AMD chip will give you the same simplicity and value as I enjoy with this proc.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I highly recommend this game! As you can tell from the description and the screenshots, it's a puzzle game. With lasers! It's challenging but it's also fun which also makes it rewarding and addictive. For me personally, things started to really get hard in sector 2 level 15. You can skip a limited number of levels in each sector if a level becomes too hard. I'm not sure how many because I try really hard not to skip any. I haven't skipped more than one level in a sector yet. Anyway, if this game has piqued your inter then give it a try!!

B000002UVX|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time. It doesn't get any better than this. I am a huge fan of all kinds of music and have listened to this album since I was 10 years old and keep coming back (I'm 24). I listen to many genres including classic rock, reggae, metal, 90's rock, some hip-hop, classical, blues, and everything in between. If you have an ear for music, you will be satisfied every time you play this album from start to finish. There are no bad tracks, just pure soul and amazing instrumentals from every artist on this compilation. My only complaint is that this disc doesn't last forever. If you like Jimi Hendrix, this is his best work, hands down. The members of Band of Gypsys, as a whole, make this album great.
B003L77G06|5.0|Imagine how happy I was to learn that I could purchase past seasons of the TV show, \\"Modern Family\\".  I was delighted to find Amazon carried it.  Because I've had such success ordering from Amazon before,  I immediately ordered the DVD.  It arrived in a short time in perfect condition.    Not only do I enjoy \\"Modern Family\\", my daughter in Munich, Germany likes it so much,  I decided to send her my copy as her stocking stuffer for Christmas [[ASIN:B003L77G06 Modern Family: The Complete Second Season]].  I will order another set for me.  Now we're all one big \\"modern family\\".
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Great case for the money, what I like about it is that it fits very snugly around my iPhone 4S, one thing to be careful about however is if you put a thin plastic membrane shield over your screen, the case fits so snug that it peeled my off on the corners when trying to get it in, be careful.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I heard the hit song on the radio and bought the CD based on that sound. I am not disappointed. It's folksy, but I love good folk music and the songs are all passionate and moody. Whenever they come on the radio, I turn the volume up. That said, this is a CD that should be listened to in its entirety as it is really has a style and continuity to it. This music is just different enough to make these guys stand out in a crowd of what could have been sleepy folk. I absolutely love it.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|can't stop listening to it.love all the songs...it's definitively one of my favorite albums!The arrangements are impeccable! Therefore, the vocals are amazing.I LOVE IT!!!!!

B005CGI3ZG|2.0|I'm usually not into dramas, especially teen-drama's.  DAWSON'S CREEK however was different. I loved the rich emotions of the show, the somewhat sophisticated and very literate dialogue between the characters.  After the 90's, MOST teen shows depicted teens as being stupid, and dialogue was shall we say, very 'hip pop' oriented.  Dawson's Creek was different.  The SONGS and music was so well choreographed with the show. If you love Dawson's Creek you'll  remember the \\"Kiss the Rain\\" scene between Dawson and Joey, or many other great scenes and music.  THEY'VE TAKEN A WHOLE BUNCH OF THOSE GREAT SONGS OUT. THIS IS NOT THE DAWSON'S CREEK YOU REMEMBER.  Sadly, I ordered this set without reading reviews.   If you're looking for an easy gift for someone, this will do it. But if you love Dawson's Creek for the same reasons I did, don't bother with this.  PUT THE REAL SONGS AND SCENES BACK INTO THE SHOW. Yes it costs money....and I suspect that many real Dawson's fans would rather pay more for the real thing.
B004WDX5P8|4.0|I loved this movie and I don't know why Ryan Reynolds didn't get an Oscar nomination for his performance. He was outstanding. The movie should have gotten more attention as well.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|I first heard Kate Bush when Running Up That Hill received airplay in Nov. 1985. I immediately bought the 12-inch single and loved it. After buying Hounds Of Love a couple of months later, I discovered a completely different side to her music. I had never heard anything like the second half of Hounds Of Love, titled The Ninth Wave, and haven't since -- until 50 Words For Snow. If you were moved more by tracks like Hello Earth than Running Up That Hill, you will fall in love with this masterpiece. Before this release, I considered Hounds Of Love -- and more specifically The Ninth Wave -- Kate Bush's finest work. The first three tracks -- Snowflake, Lake Tahoe and Misty -- are the greatest 35 minutes of music since The Ninth Wave, with many similar elements musically and thematically. On Snowflake, the vocal from Kate's son, Albert, is perfect. In all three tracks, the lyrics and music are stunning and not one second too long. Lake Tahoe and Misty are perhaps the two greatest songs in Kate's catalog. Wild Man -- the catchy single -- follows and has become one of my favorite Kate singles. Snowed In At Wheeler Street sounds like The Sensual World/The Red Shoes era Kate, and is also a great song delivered with incredible emotion. 50 Words For Snow is amazing and fun -- new-sounding Kate that's an instant classic. Among Angels -- reminiscent of Kate's earliest piano songs -- has really grown on me. It's a beautiful song to bring the set to a close. To get the most out of this album, it should be played in its entirety through a great system or nice headphones.  The song cycle feels like the passage of winter as Kate paints musical landscapes like no other. The season begins: \\"It's midnight at Christmas,\\" Albert sings in Snowflake. Lake Tahoe feels very post-holidays/January to me. Misty and Wild Man are the heart of winter. Snowed In At Wheeler Street feels like late winter and 50 Words sums it all up at the end. Finally, Among Angels moves the listener from winter into spring. The snow has melted and life begins blooming -- after a long season of fear of being lost/lonely. I could see playing the B-side You Want Alchemy immediately after this album for spring and then heading into summer with Aerial's second half -- A Sky of Honey. With the autumnal feel of The Sensual World's Never Be Mine and Rocket's Tail, she has all the seasons covered!  There isn't anything I'd change about this album. I think it's her best since Hounds Of Love, and quite possibly better. I think 50 Words For Snow and Hounds Of Love are the only albums in my musical collection where I wouldn't take away or add anything. Kudos to Kate for following her own brilliant path.
B005I6EU48|1.0|It says it's for the Kindle Fire but don't believe it. The elastic straps are in the wrong place. You have to force the Kindle into the straps. I don't mean a little bit of force but a lot of force. I will be returning mine.

B000JQUZCI|5.0|My earliest memories of the horror genre are from Saturday mornings with Grandpa Munster.  I used to get up early just to go get the paper and see which movie was showing that Saturday.  It was usually either a Godzilla movie or a Bela Lugosi-era monster movie.  So my first experience with Frankenstein was the 1931 film version and Herman Munster.  Needless to say, the original version was quite a bit different.  Frankenstein was the creator, not the monster (although he more often goes by Victor).  No stunted, criminal brain is involved.  In fact, he is highly intelligent.  I will leave it to the reader to decide for herself whether he is innately malevolent or a blank slate shaped by his early experiences, but I depart from many in thinking the former.<br /><br />Shelley's prose is often very powerful.  There are shades of Dostoevsky in Crime and Punishment.  Shelley makes extensive use of symbolism--breaking ice, the escape from science into nature, Frankenstein's relation with his monster analogized to God's relationship with man.  It doesn't have much of the suspense modern horror so heavily relies upon.  It's the kind of book that should make you think long and hard, and much of what you should think long and hard about is not entirely pleasant.<br /><br />Shelley does sometimes writes in convoluted sentences: \\"She was tranquil, yet her tranquility [sic] was evidently constrained; and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage.\\"  But that's par for the course with Victorian writing.<br /><br />I read the Kindle version of Frankenstein offered free through Amazon.  I noticed few, if any, errors.  This version contains Shelley's 1831 edits (e.g., Elizabeth is a Milanese orphan).
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I downloaded this for my kindle the other day due to the really good deal only to find out it is all 1 book. All they did was mash all 4 books into 1 so you can not choose which book to read you have to manually scroll through it to get where you want. I am extremely disappointed by this and by amazons customer service. I emailed them asking for a way to fix the issue, to find out if it was my kindle or intentional. They did not reply back they just refunded the money for it. Now if I want 4 separate books I have to buy them individually which costs more. Complete rip off in my opinion.  Amazing books though! Thats the only thing saving this whole ordeal.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Looking at som,e of the reviews posted on here and elsewhere, I thought I should to place my own review of the album.<br />I havew seen boring, drawn out, repetitive, ect in the other reviews, and yes you could take it that way, if you<br />don't take the time and listen to the album carefully.  I think that the music and television business is so lame<br />today is because a lot of people want instant gratification.  Well I hate to break it to you but 50 Words For Snow<br />does not give you that, not even in Wild Man.  Though, if you sit back and enjoy Kate's creativity and imagination<br />you will get a whole lot more.  I have listened to every song that she has made and even promos that were uploaded to<br />Youtube and I have to say, with all these song, including the new ones, there are not many that I dislike, if only<br />a few.  She is an artist that you can not always take lightly and that you must give time to absorb, take you to the place<br />she is becking you to go and let go.  You have to listen to her music, even the more pop play music carefully and then<br />you will discover things or hear things that you did not the first time.  That is where the genious of her music lies.<br />She is one of the few artist that is willing to imagine and create these cool new worlds within her music.  And that<br />is why I chose to give this album 5 stars, Kate Bush doesn't sound like any other artist, you can't label her as a<br />certain type of artist, wel maybe (Poetic Music), and she does not sound like any other artist.  She is her own and<br />will never sell out or sound like anyone else.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I just love this movie.  Its about an odd type of love affair.  I would call it a<br />chick flick but some might not agree.  If you like comedy mixed with a little<br />kinky sex (nothing explicit), buy this movie.  You will not be disappointed.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautifully written. I couldn't put it down! You fall in love with all the characters. It not only encompasses the happy side of being in love but also the uncertainty that comes with love. The story of Pidge and Travis pulled me in from the first paragraph and I found myself not only cheering on their relationship but also cursing at them when they were acting insane. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!!!
0385344325|2.0|If you have read James Patterson's books, this book is a real downer. I had to make myself pick up the Affair and continue to read it. The characters are uninteresting, doing mundane things. Reacher describes the characters and provides dialogue so blandly. Save your money and the disappointment and loss of your time.  The Affair is terrible, a waste of paper and ink.

B00687XO1G|4.0|On the good side the best things about this movie are the amazing title sequence by Saul Bass and Duke Ellington's score. The actors performances are all great. But IMHO the story is a little slow and the ending a bit unsatisfying.
0385738773|4.0|I've been looking forward to The Death Cure since I finished The Scorch Trials last year.  I have a love/hate relationship with series books like this.  I love the added depth and intrigue they bring...I hate it when I'm reading a series that's still being written because then I have to wait for the author to release the next book.  :)  This is the third and final book in The Maze Runner series (although a prequel has just been announced).  I suppose you could jump in mid-stream but I certainly wouldn't recommend it.  There's just too much backstory from the first too books, plus you don't want to deprive yourself of those great adventures.  I'm really a sucker for the new trend in dystopian novels.  I have a lot of fun with a hero trying to do all he/she can to not only make the best of a bad situation but to somehow overcome the hopeless and pitiful state of the world.  In this book we are taken to a dramatic conclusion as Thomas and his friends from the Glade try to make sense of the world around them and somehow continue the fight not only for survival but for a future worth living.  I loved the line written on the cover: \\"The time for lies is over.\\"  Both of the first two books were filled with so much deceit and confusion that throughout this entire book I still found myself questioning what to believe.  Even as events unfolded, I wasn't entirely sure what was real and what might still be a subterfuge.  This book and series pose a lot of questions through the plot and the characters.  What is truth?  What is good?  Can the ends justify the means in any situation?  Even in WICKED situations?  Who can you trust?  Can you trust yourself?  I loved the way these questions were explored in depth but never answered definitively...rather, the reader is left to ponder on them and to come to an individual judgment call.  I found the ending of a book a little bit contrived and just slightly disappointing.  While I can agree that the ending works, I think I was hoping forjust a bit more.  Especially after all of the buildup.  I think part of the reason this ending may have fallen flat is that I have recently finished up another series that had an ending that was strikingly similar in the way things played out.  Don't get me wrong...I'm not crying \\"foul\\" (and certainly not implying plagiarism).  I honestly think the ending is fine...but I personally wanted more.  Though as I think on it, with all of the many problems to unravel in this book, I would be hard pressed to come up with an ending that works as well as this one does...let alone to propose something that might work better.  In the end, I really enjoyed this series and was sad to see it end.  I was super excited to hear that a prequel is in the works...not only because it allows me to re-enter Dashner's world but also because by being a prequel it will allow for more focus on those hard questions and provide more insight into how and why decisions were made.  As far as recommendations, I really enjoyed this book and can recommend the series.  I will warn readers that the series grows more dark and violent with each book.  So if you read the first one and find that some of the concepts are too intense for you, I would suggest you brace yourself before diving into books 2 and 3.  But if you enjoy dystopia and/or a good thrilling adventure with a lot of twists and turns, then give this a try.   ****  4 out of 5 stars
B005V20JKI|2.0|The game was sort of fun until I started unlocking characters that sucked worse than the ones you start with. Some characters are near impossible to use and there is an immense lag. This could have been fun. Too bad.
1451627289|5.0|I've been a huge Stephen King fan as long as I can remember. He has the ability to create deep, complex characters that you truly care about and this book is no exception. He paints the late 50's/early 60's with a brush that could only be wielded as well by someone with a deep love and longing for that era but he doesn't gloss over the realities of racism, religious zealotry and chauvinism that plagued the seemingly idyllic era.  The first section of the book is absolutely fantastic but the middle section begins to drag a bit before it really picks up steam to come to a satisfying conclusion.  At the end of the day this is one of my favorite King books I've read in years. 5 stars.

B003X5UFWW|5.0|This movie is awesome! Absolutely marvelous fight scenes make this one to watch for any action movie fan. On top of that, the main storyline is very engaging, and gives a look at what I believe is a forgotten part of history: the Japanese occupation of China. Donnie Yen is the man, this has got to be hands down the best fight choreography in a modern martial arts flick. Don't miss this one.

0486438600|3.0|There are less than 5 pages, with designs on both sides of the paper, which is not a bright white but a beige-grayish color. The designs are extremely intricate, but all will have to be photocopied out of the booklet to be used. For the price, there should have been ten pages so the designs were on one side, for copying them the designs will show through from the other side, ruining the designs one is copying to use. I gave this 3 stars because it's the only one of this design, that isn't stick-on tattoos, the intricacy of the designs and authenticity, life sized for easy transfer. For example, a hand both sides or a foot of small to average size with the designs shown on it as one would use them. If the printer had used single sided pages & a cleaner (and better quality) paper, I would have given it 5 stars, as it is I have to pay to have clean copies made--may as well have just printed designs off the internet for free.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I love Harry Potter and I love Amazon...What I don't love is this \\"ultra-violet digital copy\\". I popped the CD into my computer and then was forced to install a couple crappy programs. I did it because I wanted to watch the movie on my computer at the time, but when I tried to watch it, it had about an hour of downloading to do. What is the point of the cd if it still has to download a bunch of crap online? I do understand that I could just pop the DVD in my computer, but I like to game while I have a movie on my other monitor. Sometimes using an actual DVD can make my game lag. I'm going to uninstall those programs from my computer and I'm very upset that I paid extra for what I thought would be a digital copy I could put on my phone and also watch on my computer. I will definately not purchase a movie again with this ultra-violet stuff. I'm also upset that in order to have the final movie on my phone, I will have to purchase this movie again, as a digital copy. It's just not fair.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|I have to say that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and when it comes to music, pretty much everybody has one.  I'm not here to try to discredit any other reviews from anyone regarding any album. I also understand that there will always be a large group of people who will criticize successful, popular, mainstream acts just because it's not 'cool' to like anything that everyone else likes. However, I do have to question those that have stated Nickelback has 'sold out' or gone 'poppy'.  As far as I can tell those folks have got to be basing their opinions solely on the tracks being played on radio. And additionally, I challenge anyone to go back and listen to Nickelback's earlier work and claim that it's 'harder' than their more recent efforts. I own every Nickelback album and personally believe that the only key difference is production.  Modern albums I admit are highly polished, but that happens to be something that I appreciate. Nickelback is one of those bands, like many great and successful bands throughout history, which have been able to find their 'niche' and stick with it.  One thing that I've always appreciated about Nickelback is the fact that I can be confident with every new album they will stay true to what has made them successful and what I love.  You will always be able to tell you're listening to Nickelback. Their new album is no exception.  Like many other NB records, they come out of the gates and kick you square in the teeth.  This Means War has got to be one of the hardest hitting, foot stomping, fist pumping, head banging tracks they've written to date.  Follow that up with the catchy Bottoms Up, and you've got a fantastic 1-2 punch to get the album kicked off. When we Stand Together seems to have received a lot of criticism which I don't understand.  Popular bands have an ability to reach a massive audience and writing a song that touches on world peace and unity isn't such a bad thing is it? There have been similar songs on almost all other NB albums and you can bet that yes, this will get a lot of radio play.  I also add that 'Lullaby' is one of the most beautiful, well written songs I've ever heard.  And again, is discouraging someone from committing suicide a bad thing? It has been written that Chad listened to thousands of popular songs and bands and analyzed what made them a mainstream success.  I have a feeling that many thousands of artists in the future will be doing the same with NB.  Chad has an uncanny ability to paint pictures with words and in my opinion, is one of the best song writers in the last few decades.   So, long story long Nickelback has stayed true to what has made them successful on their new effort.  There are plenty of hard rocking sexually/booze charged anthems, as well as a hand full of heartfelt ballads.  I say it every time I go out and buy a new NB album, but I swear this one's just about perfect.  If you don't like Nickelback, I wouldn't recommend this album because it sounds a lot like Nickelback!
1451648537|4.0|You know its weird as I sit here reading through the book about him, it really gets to me that he's gone, I have never met the guy, never had the chance to shake his hand, didnt even get to sit in on one of his key-note speeches, but this book brings a connection between me and him. i felt like i really know the guy.   From my point of view he did influenced a lot how we use technology, even if its overpriced or not that much advanced tech from a lot of people's point of view. Every computer, phone, MP3 player, software, pocket gizmo... all of it was either created by him, or by someone trying to copy him.  He also revolutionized the music distribution industry.  The IT industry would be a far different place without him.  RIP steve
0061969656|5.0|Any way you slice it, Bernard Cornwell is a master of his craft. Death of Kings in his Saxon Tales series is a good example of some of his best work. I enjoyed this novel, not wanting to put it down. I feel I know Lord Uthred and some of the other characters. The plot moves very smoothly without being predictable. The writing is flawless and crisp. Excellent. Highly recommended.

B005F3XV62|3.0|Much better than his Mall cop movie, this one has a pretty good story, is funny<br />at places and there are less embarassing moments than i tough there would be,<br />especially when your dealing with a overweight zookeeper and 2 lovely women.<br />It was fun to see what they did with the animals...by making them talk. The<br />animal script was pretty good and not too stupid. Each individual animal had<br />his/her character... and the best work came from the Gorilla character. When<br />you check the special features you;ll know what i meant.<br />So for a light comedy i do recommend this movie.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoyed this bio.  Jobs is an intriguing character warts and all.  His abrasiveness and way he treats people is pretty harsh, but his technical and design prowess and attention to detail are inspiring.  There are great parts on how he organized Apple in round 2 as CEO that are captivating and his approach sets a pretty high bar for collaboration across departments from idea to final product.  Isaacson did a fabulous writing job.  His prose is straightforward and elegant and transparent in that you connect totally with the subject and don't get caught up in his approach.    The only problem I had was with the cover.  Nice design but I had to take off the dust cover - I felt like Jobs was there staring at me - a little spooky.

0434020842|3.0|George Washington Crosby has almost reached the end of a long and productive life. He lies in a rented hospital bed, installed in his Massachusetts home so that he can be surrounded by family and visited by friends. In his better moments he appreciates the company and realizes it is time to tell them of where he has squirreled-away cash, and that a clock on the wall is worth ten times as much as he has previously told anyone. He may not have managed to tell them before it was too late; we aren't sure, because much of what goes through his mind is dreams, even hallucinations, such as when a fish leaps whole down the throat of an Indian. The Indian was probably as unreal as the fish, but the New England lake, trees, grasses, stones and creatures are recalled in full and accurate detail.<br /><br />The story unfurls after the manner of one's own family history on digging into genealogies. We learn that George has devoted 30 years of retirement to repairing and trading antique clocks, and we are treated to some fascinating descriptions of clocks and their mechanisms, purportedly from an 18th century discourse on the subject. We also learn that George's father, Howard, peddled hardware (and small quantities of bootleg whisky) and offered his services as a tinker around scattered communities in his native Maine, using an old horse and a custom-built cart described as a chest of drawers mounted on two axles.  Many of the best vignettes in the book relate to Howard, who was epileptic, and whose own father became feeble-minded and was taken away; a mystery as well as a sadness to Howard, who at the time was still a boy. Howard earned little and caused his wife, George's mother, much frustration. When she signaled that she could take no more, he left home - by horse and cart.<br /><br />I was encouraged to buy the book by a favorable review in the London Review of Books, its Pulitzer Prize, and a user review here complaining that it breaks all the rules of Creative Writing. I have no idea what those rules are, but thought a bit of creative rule-breaking could be interesting. Perhaps the rules require that a book should have a beginning, a middle and an end. When immersed in Tinkers, a reader might charge it with failing on that, but on completion it becomes clear that really those parts are all present. There are times, though, when the plot, such as it is, and its interest, flounder somewhat.<br /><br />Other novels of which Tinkers reminded me are Marina Lewycka's  [[ASIN:0143036742 A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian]] (where the account of a domestic tug-of-love is interspersed with totally straight-faced sections on the history of tractors, a parallel to Paul Harding's clocks) and Paul Sayer's [[ASIN:0385267789 The Comforts of Madness]] (the internal thoughts of a mental patient unable to communicate).hose rules are, but thought a bit of creative rule-breaking could be interesting.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|[No spoilers]<br /><br />Part 1: Half-way Through<br /><br />Before purchasing this book, I'd read a lot of reviews that [among other things, see below, Part 2] stated how agonizingly s-l-o-w \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" (ADWD) was, and how folks felt cheated out of the thrills they were anticipating due to the deliberate pacing. Well, I'd really enjoyed the previous four books, so - following minimal internal debate - decided to give this one a chance.<br /><br />Scattered among the negative reviews are those wherein folks describe abandoning the book after a few score pages - some more, some less. About 100 pages in, I thought it'd be appropriate to post an \\"in progress\\" review, but am just now getting around to it. At this point, I'm 516 pages in, and am enjoying this book just fine. We'll see how the second half goes.<br /><br />It would be accurate to state that ADWD does not appear to be paced like a graphic novel or anything like one - if you want that kind of thing, you should pursue a graphic novel. It would also be accurate to say that the amount of detail GRRM layers his writing with creates a richer, more immersive reading experience (for me, anyway). He's obviously building up to something, and I'm still interested in seeing what that is. For me, though, the pleasure is in the journey as much as it is in what may be waiting at the end of it.<br /><br />There definitely are a lot of separate threads to keep track of, and I'm not sure how far any single plot-line can be advanced until the author starts weaving them together, as he's sure to do, eventually. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the trip. Also, if it's been a while since you read the previous books, you might want to read through them again (or at least the one immediately preceding ADWD) before embarking on No. 5.<br /><br />Bottom line is, half-way through and it's a reasonably satisfying read. Have I experienced any hair-yanking plot twists or cliffhangers that make me want to scratch out my own eyes?Not yet, and if there aren't any, so be it. It is what it is.<br /><br />Will update as appropriate. Enjoy.<br /><br />Part 2:  Completed (11/26/11)<br /><br />I finished ADWD last night, and thinking about it this morning, I feel comfortable with a four-star assessment (according to Amazon, 4 stars = \\"I like it,\\" mid-way between \\"It's OK\\" and \\"I love it\\").  That is a totally subjective opinion, and has no bearing on those who loved the book or those that couldn't stand it.  I enjoyed it - it's as simple as that. Having read many reviews before purchasing this book, I'd like to respond to some of the more common critical themes I observed on the boards.<br /><br />I agree with many of the reviewers that, particularly compared with the first three books, there are not a whole lot of \\"Whoa!\\" moments in the first half of ADWD, though there are some significant developments in the second half.  Many have stated that they perceive the book to be slow, and I can understand why some would feel that way given the number of different character points-of-view in ADWD and the manner in which they shift, chapter by chapter.  Would I have enjoyed more focus on certain characters and less on others?  Absolutely - but please don't take that to mean that I was ever bored with what I was reading.  This book had the feel of a lengthy middle passage, sure enough, but one sailed under kindly skies.<br /><br />Another item that seems to be frequently mentioned is that the author spends an inordinate amount of time discussing food, clothing, and other mundane details.  GRRM does spend a few sentences here and there describing what people may be having for breakfast, or what they may be dining on at a feast, or what they may be wearing.  I don't recall any necessarily superfluous discussions of food or clothing, however - certainly nothing out of line with what's been described in the previous four books or in virtually every other book I've ever read, and occasionally just as interesting to read about.  If memory serves, more time was spent on \\"food\\" in Caleb Carr's Lazlo Kreitzer books (the private dinners at Delmonico's and the like), or in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series (see \\"drowned baby,\\" or \\"lobscouse\\").  There was one paragraph wherein GRRM described the heraldic devices on display at Castle Black, but it didn't seem to be an excessively long paragraph, by any measure - certainly in the context of a book nearly a thousand pages long.  Plus appendices.  Like anything else, though, these things are interpreted subjectively.<br /><br />The author has also been criticized for bringing no resolution to the tale as a whole and for ending ADWD itself with too many cliffhangers.  Given the number of years between books and GRRM's widely varied foci, reader anxiety is totally understandable, and I'd likely feel much more strongly about this issue if I'd started reading the series during the 90s instead of starting in 2009 - I've been able to go from books 1-5 (intermittently) w/out having to endlessly wait for the next installment.  In terms of ADWD, I did find that there was appreciable  development among most of the primary storylines in this installment.  Without giving anything away, it's safe to say that Tyrion, Jon, Theon, and Daenerys are in places very different from where they started ADDWD, though it's true that we have no way of knowing how, when, or if these storylines will resume.  Arya, Bran, Jaime, and Cersei also make appearances, though not as frequently as some might wish (frankly, I'd be thrilled with a whole book focused exclusively on Patchface, oh, oh, oh).  Quite a few readers have suggested that they won't continue with the series (or that those who have not yet started the series shouldn't do so) until it's definitively concluded, and that's a decision each reader will have to make.  I think everyone hopes it won't be too long of a wait until book six comes out.<br /><br />[A side note on \\"comments\\" about reader reviews:  I have noticed that there seems to be a LOT of disdain out there toward positive reviews (and reviewers) of this book - not simple disagreement - bitter disdain.  People are almost militant about why you MUST NOT enjoy this book.  I can't understand why people would choose to argue with someone about their totally subjective opinion of a book, and I've not observed this level of disparagement toward differing opinions outside the realm of political discourse.  I'd be interested in knowing what makes ADWD so different from other books in that regard.]<br /><br />I'll wrap-up by saying that I'd recommend ADWD to those who have enjoyed the previous books in the series, but they should read the reviews (with a critical eye) in order to know what one might expect out of the experience.  After all is said and done, though: it's a book, not a way of life.

I for one have no idea what is going on, I know they must have left a lot out of the movie that was in the book.  My daughter on the other hand really liked the move, she has read all the books.  I feel that the acting was a little better in this movie than the others, but this movie felt more like a stepping stone to their (Bella and Edwards) next life together or what ever you call it. I am getting tired of the werewolf/vampire fighting/treaty crap.  I really just think they should write out the werewolves, just keep Jacob around as the babies godfather (or whatever you would call it). Well, go see it if you must, I would have waited till the DVD but I ended up being my daughters default date for the movie, what's a mom to do?

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I was truly amazed at how well the producers were able to bring to life this comic book series as well as bring a pretty decent cast that played their roles in the movie extremely well. Anthony Hopkins no surprise played his role as the regal but wise and powerful All Father Odin extremely well,  Chris Hemsworth played the young brave arrogant Thor who later learns the true wisdom of his fathers ideals perfectly, and Tom Hiddleston played the conniving jealous step brother Loki unbelievably well.  While you'll get the rest of the cast from the comic book series they seem to mostly play as background characters as the story focuses mostly on the relationship between father and sons and brothers as you get to see Loki's fall as his jealously over his brother grows especially over the relationship Thor and Odin have and the greater admiration Odin seems to have for Thor.  The movies action scenes and effects are incredible especially for us who longed to see a live action version of the realm of Asgard come to life.  While we do get Natalie Portman in the movie as a growing love interest for Thor her character just doesn't really seem needed though which I felt was a little sad as they could have done that story plot in the movie better.  Still for all us Marvel fans out there let's cheer as we have another movie to add to the marvel universe line up until the Avengers/Iron Man 3/ Spider-man 2012 movies come out for us..

It's very well done and the attention to minute detail (although fictitious), the application of using science, etc. made for a very realistic experience.

1594744769|4.0|Ransom Riggs' very first novel \\" Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" appears to be aimed for young adult audience but manages to capture the interest of a wide range of people partly due to it's reference to WWII, and especially the treatment of Polish Jews. It also captures interest by use of eerie, unsettling photographs which look like they come right out of a freak show. The author managed to weave a plot around it, which later in the story becomes burdened with technical problems. Riggs has limited the vague explanations just barely enough to allow it to work logistically for the reader.   But in doing so, it immediately loses most of the mysteriously eerie beckoning which captured the reader's interest in the first place. It is replaced with fairly common themes being thrown at audiences today in just about every scif-fi movie of good versus evil, and those with special powers vs those without powers. However it is not necessarily clear on who is good/evil, and that manages to help keep the reader's interest.  In order to continue to keep the reader's interest in the upcoming books, he will need to tie together some of these glaring details. This will take some doing, as there seems no way to weave the eerie haunting appeal back into the story and hopefully the author has a workable plan.   What is impressive is the fact that Ransom Riggs also produced his own book trailer, and did a very excellent job at it. A quick web search using the Author's name you'll be sure to find his personal youtube site, where you can also see other videos he has made.  The making of the book trailer, (and the book) required significant time on the author's part from finding old photographs (apparently one of his hobbies) to traveling to Europe to get  video footage of abandoned mansions. The acting in the trailer is quite adequate as well, and it manages to immediately make you want to buy the book.  Rigg's writing style is a big plus, although the 1st person narrationsof the 16 yr old hero seem much more eloquently phrased than your average American teenager. Because the boy was raised in a post WWII Jewish family lends credence to this in spite of the odds that most American kids would not talk that way. The grandfather's use of the Jewish pronunciation of Jacob's name also lends credence and adds to the historical/cultural flavor. It's a nice twist, which tends to make the main character more believable (and likeable).  Rigg's vivid descriptions of physical/visual/taste/smell seemed to be just right, and the reader is not overly bogged down with meaningless detail. This tends to make the novel a very fast reader, one which is filled with believable well described action. However I couldn't help noticing that at the beginning of the book, I was savoring every detail, while towards the end I was doing more speed reading.  There are a few incidents of religious cursing, and some otherwise minor objectionable language (British Pub language). There is some violence, death, and creepy talking to the dead. There are no lewd sex scenes, but a relationship that very well may lead in that direction in upcoming books.  As some have already pointed out... the problem with reading on a Kindle is that much of the picture detail is lost...many with handwritten notes scribbled on them. It may be that those people do not know how to zoom in on a picture in a Kindle. While I own a Kindle, I'm not sure about the Kindle zoom function, as I read my copy of this novel on my laptop using Amazon's online Kindle Viewer. I used the internet web page zoom function. So this issue seems only a minor nuisance.    My gut feeling is the book should be rated a 3 for logistical problems, and the fact that the \\"haunting beckoning\\" aspect is lost 2/3 into the book, causing many readers to feel let down. But there is a chance the author can pull it off on the next book, and so I give it 4 stars.   >  >  >  >  >  >  >Spoiler Warning - Read no further = Technical Detail Problems:  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >  >Here are just some of the issues I see that will need to be worked out:  1. Miss Peregrine seemed to have a sixth sense in that she knew that Jacob was on the island, and actually flew in his window, but didn't seem to know anything about how to avoid the wight when it came, in spite of being told it was on the island by Jacob, and especially at being so experienced in protecting the children for years. She even stated that she was concerned Jacob was followed, but fails to fully explain to Jacob how the monsters/wights work. She is either a very wise bird or a complete birdbrain. Which is is? The inconsistency needs explaining.  2. The operation of the birds and time loops seems to indicate that the bird ladies are also able to induce a \\"feel good\\" effect in the loops, keeping the \\"children\\" somewhat sedated & immature even though they are of great age, and are literally \\"bored to death\\". So much so that for years they go behind Peregrine's back and cause havoc with the townsfolk. Like 'Groundhog Day\\" gone sick. This power of the bird ladies goes well beyond manipulation of  time and shapechanging. It is also manipulation of  people's minds. So if the birdies are so powerful, how can a wight capture them unawares so easily? Just because they're using contacts? (BTW, having white eyes mean no pupils or irises - minor technical flub on author's part in only saying \\"no pupils\\" - I'm surprised the editors didn't catch it)  3. It's unexplained why Jacob's grandpa didn't spot the wight hanging around the house for years (gardener & neighbor) in spite of being experienced at dealing with them. It might be good to do a book focused mainly on grandpa and events around WWII to solve this. This might also revitalize the \\"haunting appealing\\" aspect which was lost in the latter half of 1st book. Cantankerous Polish grandpas help with that. Could flash back/forth in his life.  4. The way the time loops work seems inconsistent. If an apple (or a person) was taken from the loop, and rots in present day (in a few hours) as if the years of time were applied to it, but the opposite is not true, isn't that inconsistent? If Jacob enters the time loop in the past why isn't he reduced to a chromosome? Needs explaining.  5. The explanation was given that if the kids left the time loop into present day for more than a few hours, they would die. So how is it that the kids can go talk to Jacob's dad in the end of the book? This seems unexplainable especially considering the fact that the loop did not reset in 1940, how are they even able to get to present day? You no longer have a resetting loop, but you somehow still have a time tunnel between 1940 and present day? The author completely fails to explain this, and simply rushes the reader right through it. This will need to be explained (likely whenever Miss Peregrine comes to her senses).  6. With the explanation of item 3, should also come the explanation of how \\"loop traveling\\" works (mentioned at the end of the book, wights using it). Since the children have a map of the time loops, its only expected that they'll be doing some traveling of their own.   7. Hopefully it will be explained why they kept a body of a dead boy around and continued to awake him even though he would beg to be allowed to die? That is just a weird...cruel... scene which leaves you wondering, and has no explanation? Is Miss Peregrine some sort of pervert?
0857530283|4.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book! Keep tissues with you! Between my anger and tears this was one of the most emotional books I read in a long time. I felt that Gayle was giving us to much information at times but by the end of story I realized that each and every word was a necessary addive to the story.  This was a wonderful story of courage and of devastation, explaining the inner turmoil that young (and I'm sure old) people go through when they loose the people and things that are so vital to them. The love and loss within these pages are so incredibly emotional.   \\"I sing this song with all I've got and then we get to the chorus;    'Hate me. Devistate me. Annhialte me. Re-create me. Re-create me. Won't you, won't you, won't you re-create me.'  and I start singing the chorus right to her and she smiles at me and it's like we are the only two people out here, the only ones who knows what's happening. Which is that this song we are all singing together is being re-written\\"  Book One:  [[ASIN:014241543X If I Stay]]
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was worried when I saw the reviews about this after I had ordered it for my wife's birthday.  I put the Fire in it and put it up to give to her.  I kept the packaging to send back if she was not happy that it would not completely close.  She loved the cover.  It is beautiful.  It took about 3 or 4 days but now the cover completely closes over the Kindle Fire.  My wife loves this cover!

B005IZLPMY|2.0|There was nothing but excitement as I waited in the midnight showing line for Captain America. It didn't matter if I had business in the morning (this movie would rock!). Unfortunately, that was not the case. In the end, I found myself trying to convince myself I didn't waste my time or money.   In my opinion, the movie failed to capitalize on the great cast and instead went for a very safe route or what the movie executives perceived as 'safe'. The dialogue was quite boring and there was not enough time devoted to developing the characters. In the end it felt rushed and underdeveloped. There were little character I could relate to and Tommy Lee Jone was pretty much had the only memorable moments. There is no replay value. Very sad. I really wanted to like this movie. I could give a second movie a try but I will wait to after I read reviews this time. The Avengers movie doesn't have me too excited but hopefully it will rock.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|There are several reviews which sketch the story line of this film and there's no point in repeating it. This film has a great cast -- Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris -- all talented actors, and all give creditable performances.<br /><br />The story is told in such a way that there really are no secrets -- you learn the backgrounds of characters fairly soon after they are introduced, and their \\"big secrets\\" come out early. This isn't a film about \\"secrets\\"; it's a film about stains which people carry within. The characters are stained by events or other people, but the story exposes the importance of how we react to adverse situations. All of the characters battle demons, and all fight differently. Most overcome their stain, and they do it through loving and being loved. This film isn't really about racism, nor is it about a long kept secret. It's about battling events which we perceive as being unjust, and eventually about healing. This is true of all the major characters, and if you don't see this point then I suggest you watch the film again.<br /><br />This isn't the best film ever made but it is an excellent one. I've watched it several times and I still enjoy it. This movie isn't a puzzle to be solved but a set of stories to be heard and understood.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I fully agree with other reviews that gave the five stars to it. No doubt about being this one of the ten DVD I would take to a desert island. Just want to add that I didn't expect to see Furtwangler there. I had bought this DVD in a collection with other Mozart masterpieces and in reality didn't noticed who was conducting don Giovanni. What a great surprise! I have been disapointed in the past for not finding much videos on the web showing Furtwangler conducting, not to mention any with this quality of sound! Maybe the greatest conductor of all times, at least from those we can be affortunate enough to have recordings! If you love music, please, do not hesitate adding this DVD to your collection.

0553582038|3.0|After reading the first 3 installments of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" I didn't feel the need to write any reviews on Amazon. The story thus far had been compelling, creative, and the characters were brilliant. Then, I read AFFC and everything changed. While AFFC is not a bad book, it just leaves the readers wondering where the story is going and why Martin chose to focus on SO many unnamed characters. Obviously it doesn't take a genius to recognize the complexity of this story, the relationship between the characters, and so on. Still, do we need an entire chapter dedicated the Prince of Dorn's daughter locked in a tower? Up until this 4th installment no one had given a second thought to these characters and seldom remembered references made of these them in ASOS. AFFC is also loaded with words and words of meaningless description and babble. It's not the longest book in the series, although it definitely has that feel.   Now, I just ripped the book apart and you're wondering why I gave the book 3 stars? As a reader, you still have to keep in perspective that this is the middle of the story (along with Dance of Dragons, which I haven't read yet) and until the story is complete it's difficult to accurately assess the significance of these unnammed POVs. Aside from the unnamed POV chapters, the primary characters of Cersie, Jamie, Arya, and Sansa are overall good reads.   I know some people complained that Cersie dominated the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed her chapters. Cersie is the ultimate antagonist of the series. She's conniving, self consumed, and paranoid and will stop at nothing to ensure the her son's reign and her emergence as queen. We knew all of this from the start of the series and so it's only natural that GRRM gave her so much attention in this book. Having read the previous installments, I frequently wondered why Cersie did not have POV chapters.   Jamie's perspectives add much needed levity to the story, as he's now coping with being the most feared and loathed knight in Westeros... with only one hand. He also grows and matures through the story, as he realizes his non-worth as a warrior and more importantly to his \\"sweet sister,\\" which leaves him to make an uncharacteristic decision at the close of his POV.    Arya has the coolest POV chapters as she an apprentice at the Guild of Faceless Men, which she has been led to after her encounter with Jaqen H'ghar. Most of her chapters focus on her taking on a new identify as Cat of the Canals (be warned when you see that POV chapter name), as she learns how to lie and attempts to change her face. You get the sense that GRRM is setting up something mystical for Arya by the way her POV ends.  Sansa has some interesting POV chapters. She resides at the Vale as Little Finger's captive \\"natural daughter,\\" going by the name Alayne through most of the book to hide her identity from King's Landing. Through Alayne POV you get the sense that Little Finger is rising up to power and sometimes you even feel like he's going to end up taking over the whole kingdom ;-) Still, there's too much focus on the needy little lord Robert Arryn and Alayne's struggles to function as his mother-figure.  Then there's Brienne... I don't know where to start, but I'll keep it very simple. Her character is roaming aimlessly in search for Sansa Stark on the oath she swore to Cat Stark. You as the reader know exactly where Sansa is being held, but Brienne is never on the right path and it's downright frustrating at times. However, her characters gets a fair amount of action and her POV has an eerie ending.  The Ironmen chapters are the exception to the unnamed POVs, as they focus on the birth of a new leader Euron Greyjoy, also known as \\"The Crow's Eye.\\" Euron is the younger brother of Balon Greyjoy who dies at the beginning of the book. The Crow's Eye is feared by his ironmen, siblings, but wins their liege by promising them reign over entire kingdom and convinces them to follow him in search of dragons. You get a strong sense of doom awaiting Dany in the upcoming book.   Overall, you have to take AFFC for what's it's worth. It's the middle of the story. There are no big battles and no main character gets beheaded. The focal aforementioned characters have interesting POVs that are developing quite nicely and The Crow's Eye is definitely a great villain. However, it's extremely difficult getting past the some of the unnamed POV chapters and the fact that none of the main character chapters get resolved. Hopefully GRRM doesn't take 5 years to release the next installment after A Dance with Dragons, as I fear some fans may lose interest.
B0036TGSR6|3.0|A good film, but I must say the book was 10 times better. The movie is too obvious. (No spoilers)

1451648537|4.0|The name Steve Jobs is not enough for a book to be good. They should have spent more time working on it to produce something that really portrays Steve. Steve was a perfectionist.

B004SDEP38|2.0|There are entirely free office-suite apps that perform better than this limited advertising version, and there are commercial apps that perform vastly better at a more modest price. This app isn't bad, but given the many other choices out there, it just isn't really worth your time.
B005JZBP8W|2.0|Unfortunately My Fair Lady is no longer owned by CBS or Warner Bro any longer. As seems to be the sad truth with the distribution rights of many classic films these days, they are getting passed around the table from one studio to the other as contracts and copyrights expire. Now Paramount has inherited My Fair Lady. Paramount it seems is becoming known for poor blu ray transfers of older films, and My Fair Lady is now the culmination of that lazy and cheap culture.  Unfortunately, this means that we will most likely have to wait 10-15 years before someone else does another printing in whatever home video format out does blu ray.
B0002IRY0O|5.0|Just as Celi's EMI/Munich box is irreplaceable as the distillation of a lifetime of dedication to this greatest of symphonists, so too is this earlier set 'essential' listening. A comparison between the readings from the two periods is tremendously illuminating of the evolution of Celi's art.  With tempi closer to 'mainstream', in some ways this box will be a more palatable choice for many.  These readings are much to be preferred over vonK (technically adept but self-regarding), Boehm's 4 and 7 (any blind listen will verify how bland these discs are), Barenboim ('instant on' profundity), Chailly, etc.<br /><br />Celibidache, Wand, and Blomstedt remain the triumvirate of modern Bruckner conductors.

B005APT8A8|4.0|Yet another collection of THE BYRDS, this time encompassing all eleven (13 CD's) of their Columbia Records albums from the beginning through to the final dissolution of the band.  Not included are the live or Dylan compilations-this is the strict album collection from \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" through \\"Farther Along\\".  There's a couple of different editions of this package-all from Europe-each with slightly different contents.  This import contains each album in it's replica sleeve (which is a thick cardboard stock), plus a rather nice 39 page booklet, with track by track information, all in one pretty substantial outer box-but, of course, the box will deteriorate some with use over time.  This particular edition contains the 2 CD version of the \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" set, and the 2 CD set \\"(Untitled/Unissued)\\".  \\"Brydmaniax\\" (though 1 CD) is in it's gate-fold album cover-complete with all the inside photos like the original. The sound is comparable to the latest remastering done a while back.  So don't think you're getting even newer editions sound-wise.  A lot of great music-if you don't own much of the band's music.  Another good point is that some of the later albums are now out of print, and are more difficult to find new-and are fairly expensive.  This set, along with the box set \\"Preflyte Sessions\\", full of early tracks, will give you an excellent overview of the band from beginning to end.<br /><br />At this juncture, I can't believe that anyone who likes THE BYRDS' music hasn't purchased one of several collections on the market, or the individual albums.  A NOTE OF CAUTION-THE BOOK STYLE \\"IMPORT\\" BOX SET \\"THE BYRDS THERE IS A SEASON\\", SELLING FOR UNDER $30, DOES NOT CONTAIN THE DVD INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL (STILL AVAILABLE) TRUE-\\"LIDDED\\" BOX SET.  THE BOOK STYLE SET CONTAINS ONLY THE FOUR CDs.  THERE'S A STICKER ON THE FRONT WHICH SAYS \\"4 CDs 99 TRACKS!\\", SO IF YOU WANT THE (26 MINUTE LIP-SYNCHED NOT CRUCIAL)) DVD-LOOK ELSEWHERE.  AMAZON HAS POSTED THE SAME REVIEWS FOR BOTH SETS, WHICH GIVES THE IMPRESSION YOU'RE GETTING THE DVD.  But if for some reason you don't own much of this (mostly) fine music-this is worth a look-see.  In one nice box is contained some of the best music from that era, from one of the best bands from that era.<br /><br /> The following few sentences are really subjective.  For some reason I can't quite put my finger on, this set, in some ways, reminds me of Coltrane's complete Atlantic studio recordings box set.  Hearing THE BYRDS and their music (especially early on) change over time, is reminiscent of the change and growth in Coltrane and his music.  Certainly different genres-but the results (and the satisfaction) on hearing the music seem similar.  Maybe I'm crazy, but that thought popped into my head as I listened (again) to all this music.  You may disagree.  So if you want all THE BYRDS' music-good and bad-this would fill the bill nicely.  One small personal point-if you don't own much of this music-I envy you.  Gene Clark's songwriting (especially) was first rate, and the musicianship of the band (not just studio players) was very good.  The vocals of both McGuinn and Clark (again, especially), along with Hillman and Crosby (while the latter three were in the band) make the songs come alive.  And Gram Parsons contributions were just right for the music while he was a member of the band.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to hear THE BYRDS in 1965 in S.D., when they opened for THE ROLLING STONES (what a concert!), and again in 1968 (possibly as a trio I seem to recall), on a bill that included BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD, THE TURTLES, and (I think) Linda Ronstadt.  Listening to some of these tracks brings back some good memories of THE BYRDS' fine vocals and close harmonies, and McGuinn's chiming guitar, that seemed to ring out over everything else.<br /><br />  In their career, THE BYRDS played folk, pop, folk-rock, rock, country, country-rock, and even a bit of gospel, jazz, and electronic music (thelatter courtesy of McGuinn's fascination with outer space), and most of it was of a high caliber.  Hearing this band grow and morph through the years is a very satisfying experience-and you'll have it all in one box set.  And here I must say that this particular box set has been done right.  The graphics are crisp and clean, the booklet is well thought out, even the outer box is a glossy, fairly substantial cardboard material, and (of course) the sound is clean, open, and warm.  All in all, a finely put together set.  Enjoy.<br /><br />And if you want a great inside look at THE BRYDS-check out Johnny Rogan's (who wrote the track notes in this booklet) new, in depth book-\\"Byrds: Requiem For The Timeless\\", Vol. 1.  It's an interesting, informative and deep look at the band, the music, the scene, and the changing culture-anything and everything that revolved around in THE BYRDS universe-from the band's early days up through to the end of the band.  If you're a real fan of THE BYRDS you'll find a lot to like in this massive (1200+ pages) tome.  This is the written equivalent to hearing the above box set(s).latter courtesy of McGuinn's fascination with outer space), and most of it was of a high caliber.

1451648537|4.0|The book is very well written from the linguistic point of view: nice sentences and interesting vocabulary. I like the fact that different opinions on the same issue are being presented side-by-side: first there's the story/event and the way Steve saw it. Then are the opinions and memories of other people involved in the event. So it's not just an account of what Jobs told Isaacson, but the author took the time and effort to find many other people which were present in Steve's life. I am in the middle of the book but I think that the rest of it will keep the same quality level.  I am a photographer, so my only complaint is that the book has few photos. After all this is a biography which spreads throughout many decades and there should be more photos depicting some moments in Steve's life. He did have more photos than a dozen, didn't he?

0345529057|2.0|Love the story line and fell in love with the characters from watching the series on HBO.  Was thrilled to see the collection available in an 'inexpensive' set...  Just received it today.  The books, thank goodness are wonderfully intact.  Wish I could say the same for the box that the set comes in.  While the package intself had no damage to the outside of it, no dents, no dings, packaging tape in place.  There were two full cushy air bags to keep the product from bouncing around in the box.  Even the shrink wrap on the product was intact, no tears, no rips.  Why then is the box the books come in horribly ripped and was that way INSIDE the plastic wrap?  Granted I didn't spend a fortune, but for me, this is a collection of books I wanted to receive in the condition of NEW as I had purchased it.  Guarantee my money wasn't ripped when they got it!  SO NOT HAPPY WITH AMAZON RIGHT NOW!  Buyer beware, the poor packaging is very dissappointing.  HUGE THUMBS DOWN!
0060873027|3.0|How one of the greatest science thriller novelists of all time, author of Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain, and an acclaimed science writer, author of the wonderful The Hot Zone, could concoct such a silly book is the real mystery here.<br /><br />Micro is well written, with intriguing characters. Richard Preston did a good job taking Michael Crichton's unfinished manuscript and putting it publishable form. But the main idea behind it -- shrinking things, and people, using very large magnetic fields -- is goofy, not to mention hokey, juvenile and hackneyed.<br /><br />I was looking forward to another classic Crichton thriller, but sadly this isn't it.<br /><br />--Lan Sluder
B001HN6922|1.0|Yeah... I can hear you chanting \\"Moon - Don - Key.... Moon - Don - Key.... Moon - Don - Key!\\"  You have read my reviews haven't you?  You are chomping at the bit for more aren't you?  That's right!  That's Right!  I can hear the applause now!!  Yeeeaaahhhhhhh!!!!  Wow is this a BAD film.  I couldn't even finish watching it.  BAD!  The biggest problem is the focus on the tow-truck character of Mater.  Mater should be comic relief, not the main focus of the movie.  Too much Mater just gets irritating after awhile.    Also, enough of the pc brainwashing plots.  The plot in a nutshell - old clunker cars want to make a fortune on oil so they try to sabotage alternative fuels.  That's basically it.    Cars 2, like Wall-E, is at its core a movie about telling people what to think and how to live.  And like all movies build around a message, and not an actual plot, it fails miserably.    One of the worst kids movies I've seen.  Sorry - after that killer intro this was a pretty lame review.  Probably because the movie was just so poor that I just want to wipe the filthy taste of it out of my mouth and go on to something else.... Maybe bacon.  God I love bacon.  You know - if you really want to do a good job cooking bacon, you need to get the grease to what I call the \\"dish soap\\" phase.  The bacon is about done when the grease bubbles a bit like dish soap.  Oh... the best bacon I ever had was in Jamaica at a resort.  You wouldn't think that Jamaican bacon (that sounds sweet doesn't it... just sort of a ring to \\"Jamaican bacon\\") would be good...but I suspect it is at least as good as the Jamaican weed.  Big, thick slabs of bacon  - salty as heck too.  Uhhhhh.....

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Listen, its an OK cover. NOT the best but not the worst. I bought it for $39.00 (but Amazon gave me $10 credit when the price dropped to $29). Its just NOTHING fancy. Not worth $29.00 and definitely not worth $39.00  As a stand? the notch sometimes keeps the kindle upright, They could really take lessons from the iPad on this one (that cover is awesome!)  And that whole \\"elastic band\\" to hold the thing closed? L-A-M-E!!!! The concept works for my 3rd generation kindle, but NOT for this case.  ***Update*** After using this case for a few weeks now, Ive added ONE extra star to my rating. Why? the Kindle does fit nice and snug in the case and the case does seem to stay closed even without the stupid elastic thing. It still tips over every now and again, the notch just isnt deep enough and because of where its placed adds a high center of gravity, causing it to tip over. Also would be great if you can lay it down as if you were typing on it the way you can do with the iPad cover.

1609611543|5.0|Just got my latest lab results this morning, and for the first time in my life I'm close to reaching Dr. Davis's Track Your Plaque targets of 60/60/60 (LDL/HDL/triglycerides). Especially gratifying was my LDL, 62 mg/dL, down from 99 just three months ago and 197 not long ago. Does Wheat Belly get all the credit? Of course not. The rest of Dr. Davis's TYP program (which I discovered only about a year ago) was essential too. But as a long-time follower of the Pritikin diet, a low fat diet that slowly made me sick and exacerbated bad heredity, I was delighted finally to achieve healthy lipids (cholesterol levels) while enjoying full-fat yogurt and many other delicious foods full of healthy fats and proteins that I limited or denied myself for years. Not eating wheat, on the other hand, I find ridiculously easy. It just means avoiding processed foods, and wheat is only one of many reasons to avoid them.<br /><br />About some of the few negative posts here about Wheat Belly:  (1) Dr. Davis's followers are a cult? He doesn't tolerate criticism or questions? Nonsense. There are heated differences of opinion at Track Your Plaque forums over the best strategies to beat heart disease. Some participants get angry and personal with each other, but never Dr. Davis, always a model of calm and reason. (2) Dr. Davis makes money from his books and website? Duh? Everyone seeks to make money. Question is, is the product worth the price? I imagine Dr. Davis would make far more money by advising patients to keep eating healthy whole grains, then doing costly procedures when their coronary arteries clog.

B005OHSD3A|5.0|This has everything..from true Atkins with more vegetable and salads allowed in induction, for people who don't have that much to lose or more freedom it goes into starting on Phase 2 instead of Phase 1, and for vegetarians and vegans.  Lots of tips I had forgotten or didn't know the first time around. I started again after 12 years with this diet because I was told I have Type 2 diabetes. It brought my blood suger down to below 100 after 1 week (it was going down each day!) and also losing weight..about 10 lbs after almost 2 weeks. Can't be sure as I didn't weigh exactly when I started. This time is for life..it's my health..and with this guide I can do it.
B005R4255C|3.0|I'm SURE this would be 1000% better to hear at the actual show. or at least a DVD of the show. but to just listen to as a CD, I'd rather hear original Michael cuts. I'm a Die-hard Michael fan (and rated 3 stars only 'cause I love Michael) but can't really get into this. WOULD STILL LOVE TO SEE THE SHOW THOUGH.
B005DC68NI|4.0|David Gaughran, through his own success in self-publishing, talks about how to succeed in a digital world.  He provides some resources and tips on how  to self-publish.

B005TZFYNE|5.0|I've been a loyal fan of Rihanna's since her Good Girl Gone Bad cd.  I love it and I love her Rated R cd as well as her Loud cd.  I was thrilled to see she has this new one out, Talk That Talk.  Only one copy was left the day after its release and one of the cashiers was saying she liked all of Rihanna's cds but couldn't get into this one so far.  I paid for it and left.  When I got home I immediately put it on.  Usually it takes me a while to adjust to any new cd, but I liked this one right away!  As before, her creativity means she experiments and ventures off the beaten path, at least a little, like she's done before, making her a bit of a pioneer.  The thing I like about her music and this cd included is it's like a groove that I get into and it gets into my blood and my thoughts and my soul!  Now I just have to discipline myself not to play it too often.  I don't want to have to check into rehab or anything.  Know what I mean?  Anyway, I think Rihanna's definitely pulled it off again and I'm glad.  I hope she keeps doing this each year.  Sorta helps me get through the winter, you know.

0307593312|1.0|Imagine everything you love about your favorite cocktail; the way the ingredients intermingle, often with hints of flavors that, while unbearable on their own, blend magnificently with others to create a mixed concoction to stimulate even the most nether regions of the human tongue. Now dump your glass into a gallon jug. Fill the jug to the 3/4 mark with water. Then add clam juice, tabasco sauce, maple syrup, nutmeg, and vanilla extract til you get to the top. Voila! You've got 1Q84. Drink it down, consumers.<br /><br />I'm currently 720 pages in and have resorted to skipping whole paragraphs. Why I feel the need to continue despite a blossoming blase could perhaps best be explained by my previous Murakami experience-  I first read all of his books within a span of 10 days using a flood light outside of my hotel in Singapore. Despite this I just can't see the point of 1Q84 (other than length, of course). Put simply, 1Q84 is a meandering odyssey to nowhere in particular.<br /><br />Reading 1Q84, you'll find that many of Murakami's \\"trademarks\\" are present: the contrast of an ultra-sentimental/nostalgic (natsukashii -_-) love story to its surreal sci-fiesque backdrop; minute details of each character's appearance and daily routine to make up for an otherwise flat individual; allusions to Western artists galore. What 1Q84 fails to provide is something to tie everything together into a neat little package to make me care what happens. The two main characters are eternally and subliminally united by troubled youths, voided personalities, and a single hand grab decades prior to the events of the story. My advice to Murakami is that when you're building a love story on such a thin and unrealistic connection, no matter how many times you recite their devotion to finding one another, having little people coming out of goats' mouths saying \\"ho ho\\" at random intervals throughout the book is enough to distract me from the central plot. Never mind all the other random and unresolved \\"supernatural\\" events that take place and there are many. In other words- it takes such a large extension of my \\"benefit of the doubt\\" to buy into this nearly unbelievable love connection (the pursuit of which is the closest thing to a unifying plot you'll find here) that the inclusion of such random and jolting distractions just made me abandon any wish to connect to or identify with any element of the story. Ho ho!<br /><br />A few other things I found disagreeable:<br /><br />- Question: How many times per chapter can a character come to some sort of \\"OHHH... I thought things were THIS way, but it turns out they're THAT way\\" conclusion? Answer: At least 3-7 on average. Factor this out over 920ish pages and you have a very very annoying method of character and plot development. I reckon there are about 100 of these sentences with barely any variation. Ho ho! This is not an exaggeration.<br /><br />- The same criticism holds true of the characters' thoughts on whatever world they might be in at a given time. Let's just all agree that something odd is going on and just do away with these OMG moments. Hard Boiled did this bluntly; Kafka was the ideal subdued approach. 1Q84 is just awkward in the same way as my first criticism. Paraphrased sample: \\"And then Tengo finally realized that at some point, the world he had known had become this new and different world, like a train switching tracks.\\" There. I summarized about 60 pages of text. Ho ho!<br /><br />- The sex scenes are just terrible. Superfluous breast descriptions probably amount to 6 pages of text. I remember reading a review on here that described these segments as being \\"borderline pornographic.\\" I assure you, if they were anything close to being borderline pornographic I would have been far more interested. However if the reviewer meant that in the sense that they are contrived and artificial then I would agree 100%. And Murakami is usually so capable when it comes to meaningful sexual moments! Alas, it pains me to say that 1Q84 fails miserably in this respect. I recall better examples, such as those with Kafka and his maybe sister (the one on the bus sticks out (pun intended *teehee*)- tasteful and poignant). Ho ho! Ayn Rand would make for a better writer of erotic fiction than the Murakami of 1Q84, and that makes me cry a little inside.<br /><br />- Unbearably redundant at times. Case in point: How many pages do we need to explain the same physical characteristics of Ushikawa? Probably about 14, but I don't care enough to go back and count. These useless details just thump into you. Ho ho! After a while I found myself just skipping pages of the same descriptions. This is filler, not literature.<br /><br />These are not the only flaws present, but are such that they will remain flaws no matter how the rest of the book turns out.<br /><br />Bottom line? If you really want to read 900+ pages of Murakami, read Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore, and maybe Wind-up Bird Chronicle. If it were less than 600 pages I'd have given it a second star. I'm off to make myself a pot of coffee and finish this turd so I can move on to greener pastures.<br /><br />UPDATE: Finished the book. I give the ending a \\"Meh +\\" but my relief at finally being done may have colored that. For some reason it feels as if there were no middle of the book... like the middle of the book and first and last parts were in some totally different WORLD. Get it? I'm mocking an oft-used phrase. Ho ho! Remember that sentence format because you will encounter it dozens of times. (Maybe the little people and I were just from an entirely different WORLD. Something something THIS world, compared to something something THAT world. Look at me trying to figure things out. I'm a character in 1Q84, which is like 1984 but in a different WORLD.)<br /><br />Looking back on the experience, it seems like 1Q84 parallels my own writing style when it comes to longer school papers: 1) Start with a quirky thesis/topic in which readers can see potential for enjoyment and profoundness; 2) Realize that this is a 25 page paper, that I have only one page done, and that it's due tomorrow; 3) Write 20 pages or so of gibberish that loosely develops some kind of discussion, leading readers meandering down meaningless tangents never to be resolved (Ho ho!); 4) See that it's already 4 A.M. and wrap things up (for the most part) in a page in 15 minutes.<br /><br />In summation- This book is arbitrary and ****ing long. Like I said before: if you're after good Murakami (ESPECIALLY if you're from the WORLD of new readers) here is not the place to start. And this is coming from a very big fan of his. I wonder if Knopf kept hectoring reviewers until they said something nice about it. Oh, and Chip Kidd is an excellent graphic designer. But please do not let 1Q84 turn you off to one of the world's best authors of contemporary fiction.<br />I'm glad that at least The New York Times agrees with me. Ho ho!
B004EPZ03O|4.0|On Saturday (11/19), my son and I attended an advance screening of the new movie \\"The Muppets\\".  From the moment I received the invitation, I started going back in time to when my entire family would gather in the family room to watch The Muppets on TV.<br /><br />I remember the show format being similar to \\"Laugh In\\" and 'Sonny and Cher\\" (if you are old enough to remember back that far).  I was in love with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and Fozzie's silly jokes cracked me up. Everyone was rooting for Gonzo to finally do one of his hair brained stunts right and the dancing chickens were the hit of the evening. And each show was always hosted by one of the biggest stars in Hollywood. When I told my son that I was a few years older that he is now when the show first came on TV, he said \\"Dang! The Muppets are that old?\\" Don't you just love kids...<br /><br />The movie \\"The Muppets\\" starts out back in the day when the TV show was still a major hit. A little boy (well, more puppet than boy) named Walter who doesn't fit in with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood discovers The Muppets Show on TV and lives and breathes everything Muppets related all the way into adulthood. His brother Gary (played by Jason Segel) it very protective of Walter, much to the chagrin of his very, very long time girlfriend Mary (played by Amy Adams). What was suppose to be romantic getaway to LA for Mary and Gary, turns into a trip to the old Muppets studios by the threesome.<br /><br />The Muppet Theater is now in major disrepair because the gang has all gone their separate ways.  Kermit is in seclusion. Miss Piggy is now a Vogue editor in Paris. Fonzie Bear is living foul doing bad theater in Reno and Animal is in a mental institution with actor Jack Black. When a evil oilman plans to take over the Muppet Studios and tear it down, Gary talks the Muppet gang into getting back together to raise enough money to save the studio from ruin.<br /><br />The movie is a totally cute vehicle for introducing a new audience to The Muppets while also taking the people who grew up watching the show in the 1970's back down memory lane.  My son thought all the silly gags and fart jokes were great and I was singing The Muppets song and totally enjoying getting re-acquitted with all the characters from my youth.<br /><br />My favorite character is still Miss Piggy and she was adorable with all her clothing and hair changes throughout the movie. My son was rolling when Miss Piggy started karate chopping everyone. And when Kermit started singing \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" I was singing right along with him.<br /><br />Just like in the original series, his movie had cameo appearances from major Hollywood stars like Mickey Rooney, Alan Arkin, Selena Gomez, Whoopi Goldberg, and Neil Patrick Harris.<br /><br />If you were not a Muppets fan before, you will be after seeing this cute movie.  And don't say I did not warn you when you start singing \\"The Rainbow Connection\\" and \\"Mahna Mahna\\" on your way home :)<br /><br />\\"The Muppets\\" opens in theaters Wednesday November 23, 2011 and is rated PG due to signature Muppets fantasy violence.ts while also taking the people who grew up watching the show in the 1970's back down memory lane.

Surprisingly, it allows also you to add more profiles.  I had to clear the data to make room so all progress and achievements are lost.  Anyway, if the game had a way of saving progression to the memory card, it would be perfect.  Otherwise, it runs smooth and sounds great on my HTC Evo 4G 2.3.
0307454541|5.0|This is a great read. I went through the whole trology in ten days, and will be starting it again very soon. It works on a number of levels, a whodunnit, a whydunnit, a character study of Lisbeth Salander, and of course a social critique of modern Sweden and society in general.<br /><br />Total class. One of the best ever.

0895260131|1.0|I am quite shocked that a non-Muslim claims to be an \\"expert\\" in Islam. In truth no one is an expert except perhaps the Islamic scholars who have devoted their life to the study of Islam. There is so much to read and study pertaining to Islam. I feel this book does not portray \\"the truth\\" as it purports to do. I am in the middle of converting from Catholicism to Islam and have learned that you must ready several sources (Quran, Hadiths, tafseer) to truly understand what it all means. Only 4-5 Hadiths are considered accurate and widely accepted by scholars, the other are weak and are not to be relied upon to make determine what Mohammed said and what he meant. Anyway I thin this book just contributes to hate and misunderstanding about our fellow Muslims.

B005LJK3AC|2.0|The only good part about this movie was Jennifer Aniston in a doctors outfit. Maybe it's because I'm still in school and don't yet have a career, but I found this movie to be completely unfunny. The jokes were crude and overused, the characters were completely unlikable. I turned this off about half way through. I gave it two stars instead of one because of Jennifer Aniston.
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|So I finally finished listening to the rest of the sectors, and what makes me smile the most of this set from the other? ok , lets go back to the original cd releases and the first remastered set ,and th Japanese SHM-CD version. Out of all those three type of releases the worst sounding of all RUSH on Cd was SIGNALS ! the original release sounded so muffled it wasn't even funny, then the remasters of course sounded like loud muffled, and the SHM version was not much better, So of course I put on this version of Signals and the verdict \\"HOLY FRAK\\"! I never heard Signals sound SOOOOOO Amazing before, It was absolutly fantastic and mind blowing, justice has been served, as for the rest , they are great too,although I can't speak too much for POWER WINDOWS or HOLD YOUR FIRE, but that problem does not lie in the remastering,it's the fact that both album were 80% keyboards and synths like most 80's music was then, which drowns out any instument, however I can hear Geddy's Bass much more clearer this time, as well as Alex's guitar. So big glorious thank you to Universal/Mercury/Anthem,and everyone that was in charge of making these releases come to life, finally RUSH cd's heard as they were meant to be heard, BEAUTIFULLY!

B00005Q7U3|5.0|Even better than their 1st album, Alpha has both better production and a stronger selection of songs (ie: we don't get weak songs like Here Comes the Feeling, Cutting It Fine, or One Step Closer from the 1st 'self-titled' album).  Only thing that's missing on this cd is the song Daylight which was on the cassette release (but available on other compilations nowadays).
145551389X|5.0|I got this in the mail the day it came out and I absolutely love it.   I was surprised by how big and heavy it actually was. It has 450 new never seen pictures of Lady Gaga and is every little monsters dream. I cried the first time I looked through it all.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|What a great sound this new version has. Aqualung has never sounded better unless you were there in \\"68\\" for the concert with Ian in his torn black bath robe, tossing his flute high in the air doing a piroette comming down on one knee and catching the flute right with the beat and singing \\"Sitting on a park bench\\".  This is not all Steve Wilson has done this year, he also remastered most of the King Crmson's songbook as well as released his own double CD which is fantastic!!!! If you haven't heard Poreccupine Tree, No-Man or Steve Wilson, you must, keeping prog rock alive and strong.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|*Episode Spoilers*   I love this episode through and through: the danger lurking in every corner, the eeriness of the deserted landscape, the road-block and the cars, the herds of zombies. The imminent danger and terror were palpable at every moment, perfectly conveying that mood of terror and desolation. The herd scene was very intense and almost difficult to watch as i felt so drawn it, it was like i was there with them, being scared to death that one of the walkers might bend down, see them and take a bite. It was pure terror. I like how the episodes (Season 1 until now) go from delightfully scary to unexpectedly terrifying about half-way through. The scene where Andrea is still in the RV playing with her gun when the walkers are right outside and the little delay until she discovers them but it is too late and she is trapped inside: perfection. So intense. I was dying watching her locked up in the small restroom and the walker right outside. If only all episodes in this season were like that.   What did bother me was all the men deciding that the little women shouldnt get any guns in a world overrun by zombies and where a walker seems to be waiting at every turn. That was ridiculous and pretty sexist and short sighted. I also couldnt believe that the kids were allowed to just roam around as they pleased and how Carl was allowed to go on the search for Sophia; in fact that entire scene where he asks for permission and Lori gets all \\"cutsie\\" about it  - as if she was debating whether she should let him go camping tonight and not as if she was juts about ot send her 10 year old into the woods filled with zombies - seemed ridiculous.   I did like how Andrea eventually confronted Dale and accused him of having taken away her choice to die on her terms as opposed to being torn apart by drooling freaks. I had never thought about it that way but given their predicament it did make sense and as the audience it does make you wonder what you would choose if the world had come to an end and being scared and the race to stay alive where the only things to live for. Suddenly Dale stopped looking like a hero who saved her life. It was acted very believably because you see that moment of epiphany in Dale's face where it occurs to him for the first time that what he did wasnt selfless deserving gratitude, but in fact quite selfish. That is the kind of strong dialog and exchange I expect to see throughout this season.   Altogether I think this was one bada$$ episode from start to finish and I am so disappointed that the subsequent episodes of this season have failed in that regard and that we have gone essentially from a fantastic season premiere filled with all the amazing elements that made Season 1 excel to one that looks like an empty balloon you let all the air out of and that is sort of just sitting around deflated. This is how I see the subsequent episodes anyway - especially compared to Season 1 and the Season 2 premiere.  Bring Darabont back and fire the new writers who seem to be coming from the daytime soap genre.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Super8 is an unabashed mix of some John Carpenter, 80s Spielberg and and the pilot of LOST.  Now each of those things in its own right can be inspired, but somehow all of them together don't move past the feeling this is an extended episode of a cable TV show.  I'm not going to point in too many directions to spoil the film, but J.J. Abrahms pulls the Shyamalan card too and tries to lead us with bread crumbs into something surprising.  There are no surprises.  The movie would have been better served sticking to the core of friends out to make a movie instead of going to the recycle bin.  The friends making a movie part actually rings true from the heart, but it quickly goes down the chase movie route and the bulk is been there done that 30 years ago and then some.    Is that to say the movie is not worth your time?  Heck no.  Super 8 is not surprising, nor original, but the movie is entertaining.  Buy?  Nope.  Rent?  Heck yeah.
B004L49JYO|2.0|This is one of those movies that I really wanted to like but, unfortunately, it's no more than a two star movie.  I was looking forward to seeing Eihi Shiina in something other than the now classic \\"Audition\\".  Her acting was well done as the heroine but that could not overcome the overall movie.<br /><br />The blood and guts gore stuff is over the top and not very realistic but there's enough of a plot to not give it one star...although it comes damn close.  I believe it also tries to have a bit of a political statement which I find odd due to the campy nature of this film.<br /><br />The fact is, it simply is not a very good movie. Many reviews have focused on the gore aspect of the film.  If you don't like gore simply because it's gore, then you are not a true film fan anyway.  Gore does one of two things:  it either adds to the tension or it adds to the comedy.  If it does neither, then the amount and level of the gore is irrelevant.<br /><br />My favorite movie reviewer of all time, Gene Siskel...who, by the way, is longer available...always gave great reviews, ones that I generally agreed with.  However, he was one of those guys who hated sex and violence in films.  If he said \\"this is a great movie and would be a four star movie if it didn't have so much sex and violence\\" I knew it was a four star movie.<br /><br />If you happen to be into this genre of Japanese films or like artsy, colorful films...not to mention the campy gore...you may enjoy this on that level.  However, if you're looking for a good story, this ain't it.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Henry Cavill, Mickey Rourke, and Luke Evans delivered exactly what I was hoping for. The cinematography in the movie was excellent. Really good character development. The fight scenes were great. Mickey Rourke was casted perfectly to play a psychotic enemy leader. Henry Cavill plays a great warrior and leader. The Gods in the movie gave me goose bumps. Luke Evans plays a great Zeus. This movie is worth seeing in the theatre and a definitely a blu ray purchase.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I can play for long periods of time without feeling like my brain is dead. Switching from character to character is a good way to keep my mind thinking. Rather than just a simple hack and slash game.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is the best dog movie. Even if you hate dogs, it will convert you. If you have a dog, you will totally get it and will probably wind up buying an extra copy for your dog to watch while you are work. This movie proves absolutely why dogs are better than people.  Another thing about this movie:  I was never a fan of Richard Gere.  In fact, some years back there was this ongoing joke involving gerbils, but, well that's another story.  Anyway, Gere has now been completely exonerated by this movie and he now has my full respect. The acting by the people in this flick is very good, but the dog steals it in spades. And forget about getting through this without crying--this movie is very \\"ruff\\" on your emotions (sorry).  I could go \\"fur\\"ther, but you get the point.  So go get the movie, six boxes of Kleenex and curl up with a hot chocolate and some Alpo.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|I'm not used to the currently stylish BIG watches, but this one looks very nice.  The actual face of the watch measures 1.75\\" across, 2\\" if you include the button on the side.  The face is a nice dark blue and black color, and the band is lined with soft leather on the inside and black cloth fabric on the outside which gives it a more casual look.  There are a lot of adjustment holes and they're spaced pretty close together so you can comfortably adjust the fit on your wrist.  The chronograph (stop watch) functions are easy to use (for when my kids want to know how fast they've ridden their bikes around the block or how long they hold their breath underwater!) and have dials for 10ths of a second, seconds, and minutes.  The only thing I find a little awkward is the placing of the date, which is on an angle and by the 4 instead of the 3, but I'm getting used to it.  The date can be adjusted by pulling the center dial out one click instead of having to move the watch hands all the way around like some watches.  In all, this is a very nice looking watch (and yes, it really does come in a bright yellow box).
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Stephen King's novella fleshed out and  made three dimensional. Casting is superb. Emotionally satisfying on so many levels.

My favorite part of this book was the end----there are easy activities for the kids that ask them to match colors with the animals, etc.  It's a great resource for babysitters or older siblings who are reading with the littles and want to provide a little extra interaction.  Don't hesitate to get this book----the best gift you can give your kids is a book!
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|CONTACT is an excellent sci-fier based on a Carl Sagan story and directed by Bob Zemeckis that deftly considers not only the possibility of life elsewhere but also both sides of the eternal debate on whether there's a Divine Being.<br /><br />It stars Jodie Foster as a scientist who tenaciously clings to her SETI explorations despite obstacles and resistance from her boss (Tom Skerritt). Just before the plug is pulled and Foster's Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence team is evicted from Socorro, NM's Very Large Array radio astronomy observatory, they get a hit. Monitored signals originating from the Vega constellation send a mix that includes a 1936 TV broadcast from Nazi Germany of the Berlin Olympics, the first high-powered signals of such a type. These apparently took 26 years to reach Vega, and 26 years to be bounced back.<br /><br />Not as a criticism of the plot, but this raises a question in my mind. I know little of physics, so it'll probably sound as dumb as I am on the subject. If there's nothing in the universe that's perpetual, including energy, how can a radiowave, which is a sort of energy (yes?), travel billions of miles without dissipating?<br /><br />Anyway, news of this discovery brings out the lunatic fringe, each group converging on Socorro, all with different agendas. Most amusing are the Chevy Vega car clubs; most frightening, some scruffy Neo-Nazis and a raving \\"end-of-the-world\\" proselytizer.<br /><br />When sub-frequncies are unscrambled and a language decoded, scientists are able to construct a one-person craft (from instructions sent by an unknown ET) that will instantly transport a passenger across the universe. Unseen events occur and Jodie is the one selected to make this voyage.<br /><br />A \\"traveling through a wormhole\\" sequence is terrific and quite scary. Jodie arrives safely on a planet somewhere in Vega. The next scene is so obviously foreshadowed early in the film the alert viewer is expecting it, and yet I found the experience to be very emotionally stimulating. In hindsight, it occurred to me that we were SUPPOSED to know what's coming. Not being caught off-guard is what makes the moment so satisfying.<br /><br />Bottom line is: I love this movie.

But Tina Fey has been in theater, drama, comedy for much longer than that.  Here is a humorous take on her life.<br /><br />After listening to \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", I was a little nervous about these humor biography books.  Did I not like them, was it my mood at the time of reading, or was it just that one book?  Hearing lots of good things about \\"Bossypants\\" made me check this book out in audio format.<br /><br />I highly recommend listening to this on audiobook.  Tina Fey is gifted at humor (take that \\"Women aren't funny\\"!), but what is better is hearing her tell her own jokes.  I could definitely see how reading this may not have been as funny as hearing her tell her anecdotes.<br /><br />Tina Fey starts out with her childhood and continues until present day.  She covers her parents, being a child of the 70's and 80's, teenager woes, college days, her time in odd jobs, her time at SNL, 30 Rock, and her Sarah Palin impersonation.  I was enthralled at her stories; I laughed at her jokes; I loved her positive message about women in the workforce.  She had humorous takes on being a woman, she didn't resort to mud-flinging, she was classy, but still she was interesting.<br /><br />Without going into specifics (and possibly destroy the humor of her stories), let's just say, Tina Fey's novel was a joy to listen to.  It isn't for everyone--I don't know how very conservative Evangelical Christian Republicans might take this and I don't know how funny this is in paper form--but I definitely enjoyed this book and have plans to check out 30 Rock.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

0307388921|5.0|I think I've read one too many self-help books about addiction and recovery. My addictive nature grabs on to things and just won't let go. Since I quit drugs and alcohol, I've been addicted to yoga, playing music, running, and now I've read something like 77 or 78 books in a row about, or related to addiction, recovery, and spirituality.<br /><br />  I don't seem to know what moderation means. I guess that means I've still got issues I'm running from. So in the meantime, I'll just make sure all this addictive energy is focused on something positive, because when it's not, things get out of control really quick.<br /><br />  I found this book with the front cover ripped off called \\"Choke\\" by Chuck Palahniuk. I flipped it over and found a review on the back by the Village Voice that said, \\"Puts a bleakly humorous spin on self-help, addiction recovery, and childhood trauma.\\" Now here's something I can read that's an antidote to my self-help malaise, and hey, it's still about recovery, in a way.<br /><br />  The fictional character, Victor, says, \\"Just so you know, what you're reading is the complete and relentless story of an addict. Because in most twelve-step recovery programs, the fourth step makes you take an inventory of your life. Every lame, suck-ass moment of your life, you have to get a notebook and write it down. A complete inventory of your crimes. That way, every sin is right at your fingertips. Then you have to fix it all.\\"<br /><br />  Palahniuk's gift for satire is brilliantly displayed in the character, Denny, Victor's friend who starts collecting a rock for every day that he stays sober. Pretty soon the refrigerator's full of rocks, the dishwasher, washing machine, oven, rocks everywhere. So he decides to build a church or something with them. That's that addictive energy I was talking about earlier.<br /><br />  Palahniuk is sick, funny sick. \\"Choke\\" had me laughing out loud several times, but like a mirror reflecting our true selves back to us, it also shows how sick we all are. Like a lot of people in recovery, I've got to learn to lighten up a little bit, and it's really hard to take myself so seriously after reading a book like \\"Choke\\".<br /><br />David Allan Reeves<br />Author  of \\"Running Away From Me\\"people in recovery, I've got to learn to lighten up a little bit, and it's really hard to take myself so seriously after reading a book like \\"Choke\\".

0316098329|3.0|I often wish we were allowed to award half-stars to indicate a book a little above mediocre but not quite extraordinary.  To echo the sentiments of so many other reviewers, I found the premise fascinating:  a young college student is kidnapped by a sexual deviant and imprisoned in backyard suburbia for years on end;  she is repeatedly raped and eventually bears a living child whom she protects with a fierce cunning which she could never seem to muster to shield or save herself.  Told through the eyes of now-five-year-old Jack, we learn through his innocent thought-babble that his mother has lavished him with any educational or enrichment activity possible within their prison.  Their captor, whom the mother calls Old Nick, doles out a weekly favor, a \\"Sunday treat,\\" which the mom uses judiciously on Jack's needs and certain luxuries.  Jack is an understandably bizarre mixture of precocious little knowledge-sponge and psycho-socially and emotionally delayed baby boy  (he knows complex vocabulary but feels little empathy, still speaks some baby talk and nurses). When they find a way to escape, Jack and his mother are ill-prepared to reenter the real world, and their journey is a tough one.      What makes this book difficult is that yes, it's hard to read a harrowing account through a delayed five-year-old's voice, but tales told through the eyes of traumatized children have been done brilliantly and with great effect (remember The Color Purple??).  This just feels a touch intentionally precious at times--Jack's repetitive cutesy phrasing seems to be thrown in to tug at the reader's heartstrings but it just serves as an annoyance when what we want is more of the actual story--and the author could have benefited from some editing advice about trimming certain sections and not glossing over others (what makes the mother decide upon this particular escape route?  What about her own psychological health?).  My biggest issue with editing is that the story seems to be set in the U.S. but the author uses terms, sentence structures and slang which the average American will not relate to  (we  do not casually refer to the devil as Old Nick here).  Surely someone could have caught and corrected this?      Great story idea, adequately but not wonderfully executed.

B005G4TJUC|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two Transformers and was looking forward to this one. In my opinion it was an utter let down. Sure the action was great. The fighting was awesome. But that is what you would expect from a Transformers. The story was lame.. I was constantly wondering what was going on because it kept jumping all over the place. There were a lot of totally unnecessary risque parts. I really was not impressed. Again this is coming from a fan of the series. I really hope they can get it right in the next one or they have lost a fan.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|This cover is lightweight, with a non-slip rubber texture on the outside and the inside is felt lined, so your screen is protected when the case flap is closed. It also comes with an elastic band on the back so you can move it forward and keep the case closed.  The design is user friendly and effective, with easy access to the speakers on the top and to the headphone and micro usb plugs, as well to the power button on the bottom. It holds the Fire perfectly.  It looks durable and a little bit overpriced (I paid $29.99). I think a price tag around $20-$25 would be more adequate for this product.  The only con I found is the fact that the elastic band is glued to the cover, not stitched, and this is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|Green Lantern starts with great promise: a brief narration informing the viewer of the fictional lore and setting, an interesting interaction between two Green Lanterns, to a brief but impressive action sequence. The second Ryan Reynolds appears, however, the problems begin. But the fault isn't only his. And that's at about the five minute mark.<br /><br />The writing and acting, overall, is basically goofily cliched and poorly thought through. None of the Lantern's fabricated constructs are clever. In fact, nothing is clever in this movie. Some examples of poor or sloppy writing off the top of my head:<br /><br />- The romance isn't believable at all. It feels like two 40-somethings remembering their old flames, rather than two thirty year olds remembering how they met years before. The setting, \\"their song\\", the way they interact.... it's as if they were decades older than they were<br /><br />- There is a point when the Green Lantern flies through an asteroid belt..... between the Earth and the Sun. Pretty sure even elementary school children are aware of where the asteroid belt is located<br /><br />- A sequence that is supposed to be a dramatic juxtaposition between the development of the Green Lantern and the villains herald was clearly spliced, and has this corny upbeat music playing to it the entire time... I actually laughed out loud at the scene.<br /><br />- An alien makes mention of how he has never seen a human, barely heard about them, implying he knows very little of our culture or history. Then moments later refers to a star as \\"a sun\\", a word humans gave to the star in our solar system. Why would the alien call it that? Why not \\"a star the mass of your sun\\"? Just lazy<br /><br />The frenetic CG action sequences look pretty, but are a bit minimalist and occasionally silly. It can't be said enough how much they go out of their way to hit every single action movie cliche and trope from the past thirty years - often revisiting them within the span of afew minutes.<br /><br />Despite the source material being a dark, often apocalyptic space opera, this film is light and family friendly. Shallow family relationships that have no depth or bearing on the story eat up screen time. Virtually no character is developed, even the lead, so it ends without you having any interest in a sequel.<br /><br />The acting is uneven. Mark Strong as Sinestro is easily the most solid and stable - in fact he is quite good. Reynolds does his best as Hal Jordan, the titular Green Lantern, but the character is written so poorly (and again, riddled with cliches) that he just can't salvage the part. You get the feeling that if a proven dramatic actor had been chosen they could have made it into something. Blake Lively turned in a TV-caliber performance, far from the spectacular job she did in The Town.<br /><br />By the time you're fifteen minutes into the film it begins to become hard to watch. Everything mentioned above, along with an ugly pacing, is the cause. By the time the 45 minute mark comes you're probably going to have rolled your eyes so much your sockets will ache.<br /><br />Oh, and this is a petty criticism, but the costume looks particularly silly. It's not endearing or visually pleasing; the movie isn't even that old and yet the costume already looks like something dreamt up decades ago.
B004EPZ084|2.0|Horrible Bosses takes a darkly comic premise and pretty much plays it safe at every possible turn, which eventually results in a movie that thinks its funnier than it really is. It's a shame because the actors in the film are well cast in their respective roles, but the movie quickly devolves into the sort of sophomoric humor that passes for funny nowadays. Easily the best part of the movie are the bosses themselves played by Kevin Spacey (who's great at playing severe a-holes), Jennifer Aniston (in a nice bit of stunt casting that's a refreshing difference from her usual Rachel-centric roles) and Colin Farrell (who excels at playing the King of the Douchebags). It's strange, given that their characters are so one-dimensional, but the energy and malevolence they put into their roles goes a long way towards working in the movie's favor. Unfortunately, they only have about 20 minutes of screentime total throughout the movie and then we're stuck watching the sometimes tedious shenanigans of Jason Bateman, Charlie Day and Jason Sudeikis as the oft put-upon underlings who have to deal with an elitist jerk, a crazy nympho and a complete tool. Bateman, Day and Sudeikis do what they can with their roles, but they're really just not as engaging a character as their horrible bosses. As a result, the movie loses steam severely in its second half when it focuses more on these guys and their dumb attempts to off their employers.  Part of the problem is that the Day/Aniston conflict just never rings true as a really horrible situation (a fact that several characters in the film even admit to not really being a problem), so the story has to go to implausible lengths to present the situation as undesirable, much to the detriment of the central plot of the film. Sure, it's easy to hate the other two bosses, but I think most people will just wonder why Aniston's oversexed antics warrant her being killed. The sad part is that the movie seems to realize this, so this particular conflict is the least addressed in the film. Instead of making Aniston's character older or more undesirable (read: less attractive), the movie might've gotten more mileage out of the situation. But then, you'd probably have people criticizing the movie because it infers that older or less gorgeous is not sexy and this movie can't afford to alienate anybody, so they play it safe instead.  Our three leads also never actually kill any of their bosses (at least, not directly), so the movie wimps out on that sticky plot point as well. Instead you have three guys presented as seemingly smart and capable in their professions act like total f'ing morons for the last hour of the movie. It's boring, it's tired and you've seen this kind of comedic flailing around several times before. There's also the weird notion where the film tries to present Sudeikis as some kind of irresistible lothario who not only hooks up with Aniston, but Julie Bowen as well. This notion, like the movie, just seems like some sort of juvenile wish-fulfillment presented as a \\"hilarious\\" movie.  Ultimately, if you have no awareness of comedies pre-2000, you'll love this film. If you've enjoyed the work of the Zucker brothers, Mel Brooks or even Chevy Chase, you probably won't like this. It starts off strong and sets up a great idea, but then just completely misses the mark by channeling a Hangover type of comedy that never really does the central plot any justice. This movie is the comedic equivalent to a horror film that cuts out all the gore and grue in order to get a PG rating. While this movie is rated R, it's only because of the f-bomb and some racy dialogue, which is a hallmark of lazy comedy. Think of it like Bob Saget - sure, it was funny for a moment after Full House got cancelled and he just said the foulest things he could think of because he was on a family friendly show for so long... but then the novelty wears off and you're left with a not particularly funny comedian. That's what this movie is:one big Bob Saget. It was funny for a minute, but then ultimately just became tedious.  3 stars for a promising first half and 1 star for a disappointing second half. As a whole, Horrible Bosses gets 2 stars. Worth a look if you want to see Jennifer Aniston not be Rachel for awhile and to see Kevin Spacey return to the a-hole roles he does so well, but you probably won't watch it again.

0061969656|5.0|This new entry into the Saxon Tales series by Bernard Cornwell is a pivotal one because it heralds the transition of the monarchy began by Alfred the Great to his son, Edward. The tale is told by Uhtred as are the other books in the series.  Uhtred is a Saxon but he was raised by the Danes to become a fierce warrior with no faith at all in the Christian religion but was taught to read by a Christian monk.  Having sided with Alfred, a man he does not like because of his Christian piety and what Uhtred views as hypocrisy, he sees in Alfred the ability to bring order to the chaos of the times. He views Alfred's son Edward as a wuss who (like his father) engages in wild behavior in his youth all the while surrounded by his father's clergy.<br /><br />The time is right at the turn of the century from the 800's to the 900's--a time the Christian clergy believes will bring Christ back to earth. For the Danes, who occupy a big hunk of Britain north of East Anglia and the Midlands, east of Wales and south of Scotland--roughly a line along Liverpool, Manchester and Norwich--it is a time to grab Wessex and Mercia as soon as the dying Alfred passes on. The English monarch had succeeded in keeping the Danes at bay by developing a national defense system made up of a series of 'burhs' or fortified towns in addition to his own army and those of his allies. However, the Danes (Vikings) believe that the alliances build up by Alfred will disappear when competing claims for his throne ensue upon his death. That is the time to attack. Because Uhtred has promised Alfred on his deathbed to support his son Edward, Uhtred is given a land grant of considerable value, and so is bound by honor and protecting his land to the feckless Edward.<br /><br />Two new interesting characters join Uhtred in this tale. First is a traveling film-flam man named Lucca who is retained as an early version of a GPS system since his travels have given him knowledge of the road and trail system in England. Second, is a priest, Father Cuthbert who the new King Edward (or his clerical advisors) sends to Uhtred to be his chaplain. Uhtred tells the priest that he is unwanted and unneeded,  and the self-deprecating chaplain refers to himself as 'Saint Cuthbert the Unnecessary.' His lack of piety endears him to Uhtred and Cuthbert joins Lucca and the others in Uhtred's entourage in their adventure to find out what the Danes are up to and how to stop them.<br /><br />To aid in his plans, Uhtred travels to meet with a sorceress named AElfadell whom the Danes believe foretells the future. AElfadell is an old hag who drugs Uhtred and tells his future through a beautiful young girl (or goddess) named Erce who beds and enchants Uhtred. For Uhtred, the events happen as in a dream, but he believes what Erce has foretold.  More importantly, he knows that the Danes will believe it as well as many of the Christian Saxons. During an age when demons and witches were as real as Republicans and Democrats (and more believable), the power of a prophecy was a strong weapon. Uhtred plans to use this weapon to thwart Danish plans.<br /><br />Throughout the Saxon Tales series, Cornwell depends on the' Anglo-Saxon Chronicles' the best historical resource available. While the best available, it is highly unreliable, and Cornwell readily acknowledges that fact. If he's not certain (and/or there's no record) he invents what works with his story and does not attempt to pass it off as 'likely' or even 'plausible.' Uhtred's ongoing affair with King Edward's sister is one such example. Cornwell is as faithful to historical events as possible, but makes no apologies to bend a fact or two to keep his story going. I have no problem with this kind of story telling, and were he to chronicle the dullness of Alfred the Great, I doubt that many readers would learn as much as they will about this little-studied niche of British history.er Cuthbert who the new King Edward (or his clerical advisors) sends to Uhtred to be his chaplain.

0307593312|3.0|In my opinion, since Murakami didn't do such a great job writing \\"1Q84\\" (which could have been a really good book by the way) Tengo should be approached to rewrite it. It makes me think that maybe it was one of those books that was commissioned by the editors instead of coming from the author's need to write it. I don't know if that has been done before but what if Murakami got back on it and give his readers another edited version of this book the one he should have done in the first place: Write in his own voice with his own visions. Well I would give it another try, sometimes recipes have to be tried more than once to succeed.

The research for the novel is amazing and it makes you wanna know more and more about Dallas, 1963, JFK, LHO and all that.

1594203059|4.0|Niall Ferguson is not afraid to take on universally acknowledged truths and challenge them.  He first made a name for himself as a champion of the counterfactual or alternate histories, later became an apologist for (many would say advocate of) Western imperialism, later still a contentious chronicler of the World Wars, then during the financial crisis of the past few years an analyst of the missteps and aberrations that led to it.  In Civilization: The West and the Rest, Ferguson has returned to his roots as a world historian to inquire \\"Why the West?\\" Why did an isolated peninsula in the northwest corner of Eurasia and its offshoots in North America and Oceania come to dominate the world beginning some five hundred years ago?<br /><br />Although Ferguson does not like the term, he is firmly within the tradition of the Eurocentric historians here: the West became dominant because of the advantages it gained from six developments or \\"apps\\": competition, modern science, private property rights, medical advances, the consumer society, and a strong work ethic.  Civilization is divided into six main segments detailing each of the apps as they developed in the West (primarily Western Europe and North America.) Each segment is filled with fascinating anecdotes and vignettes selected to illustrate a larger point, such as the invention and spread of blue jeans as an example of the consumer society.  Ferguson writes vividly and well, if sometimes a bit astringently, and even people who haven't read much history should find the book scholarly but accessible.<br /><br />Civilization is history as Westerners like to see it: we were the best so naturally we came out on top, and there is a great deal of truth to the idea that European culture gave the West some crucial advantages.  Where Ferguson falls short is in his tendency to give short shrift to other cultures.  Yes the Europeans were competitive and capitalistic, but so were the Chinese and the Indians, and Ferguson doesn't go into enough detail about a major reason the Europeans were able to outcompete the rest: after they gained the upper hand they used economic exploitation to ensure that they kept it. Ferguson compares European productivity with productivity in 19th century India and China for example, but fails to point out that Indian and Chinese workers had less reason to be productive than Europeans: most of what they were producing wasn't going to benefit them, but their colonial masters.  In the same way Ferguson criticizes Africa's slow development, but glosses over the fact that its European overlords drained the continent of resources for many years. To be fair, Ferguson does spend more time criticizing imperialism in this book than he did in some of his earlier writing, but nevertheless he still leaves his readers with the impression that the West got what it deserved and the Rest did too.<br /><br />Although there are many pages which will draw comment and criticism, Civilization deserves to be considered one of the most noteworthy histories of recent times.  Perhaps the most important segment will be the conclusion.  Subtitled The Rivals, it examines relations between the West and the Rest, especially China, concentrating on the last few years of financial crisis.  Here Ferguson asks whether the West is at beginning of the end of its long dominance, and analyzes the chances that it will be replaced in the coming century by China as the dominant power.  Even more importantly, Ferguson also discusses the way civilizations decline, refuting the notion that it is a long drawn out process lasting centuries and arguing that the end sometimes comes quickly and catastrophically. While there is much in Civilization that is contentious and much that is incomplete, nevertheless it is an intriguing and valuable work.il about a major reason the Europeans were able to outcompete the rest: after they gained the upper hand they used economic exploitation to ensure that they kept it.

B005V20JKI|3.0|First thing is to deal with the HUGE elephant in the room, why does it need so many permissions? Or &quot;vague&quot; permissions? DATA MINING PERHAPS?? 2nd, why does it have to switch characters so much? The unicorn blows and who doesn't want the archer that shoots in both directions? Other that that, the game looks great and does play well on my Kfire. I'm bothered by the spyish settings it contains, so not sure I'm keeping it, even though it's free...today.  No issues as some are reporting. You may have to go into your settings, go to applications, select all applications, and find the Amazon app that actually says &quot;appstore&quot;, then click clear data and restart your Kindle.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I borrowed the 2nd season from a friend, couldn't wait to see the third, am very glad I ordered it.  I enjoyed it very much.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Of any living musical artist, Kate Bush is the one who best understands her materials - music, voice, silence and words - and how to use them. She confessed in an interview this week (Nov 22, 2011) that she has lost interest in writing pop songs. For anyone else this would be a disaster; for Kate and for us it is a godsend. Pop music is really for teenagers after all; this album is for grownups. In 50WFS Kate has pared back her trademark lush layering of sound to key elements, yet they are used more artfully than in any of her previous work. It is recognizably Kate, but with a new kind of muscle and power that calls to mind the martial artist - someone who is at once both peacefully gentle and powerfully able - even dangerous.<br /><br />You should listen to this album as an album: snow is a subtle, fragile, beautiful and often deadly substance. As we move into the songs we are guided through landscapes of beauty, death, absence, mystery, unification, humor and joy. Each song tells a story, yet all are united through Kate's unique musical approach.  As one interviewer joked with her, \\"They won't be singing THESE songs on the X Factor.\\"  No indeed.  50WFS is in another class entirely.  You likely won't get it on the first listen, and you may not get it on the third or fourth. But keep listening and the songs will open up, you'll begin to understand the great artistry at work here. Then your heart, too, will be caught up.<br /><br />Only Kate has the mastery to take something as trivialized in popular culture as the Yeti and return to it the full mystery and elusiveness of the being that the lamas claim is a god. The erotic snowman of Misty IS a god - the God of the Greenwood in winter guise, summoned by the blood on her hand, and taking his one-night-stand with a human as the ancient gods were wont to do.  Lake Tahoe is a place where snow can kill you rather quickly, as can falling off a cliff into the icy lake; the lonely spirit of this legend finally finds peace when her old dog comes home to her.  Yet these are not ponderous or overly serious songs, they have an open, light, airy quality underpinned by darkness. Kate turns playful in the title song and enlists Stephen Fry for a roll call of 50 ever more ridiculous words for snow - even including the Klingon word: peDtaH 'ej chIS qo'.<br /><br />If you are looking for a snappy pop album to jazz up your Christmas party, you are in the wrong place. But if you're willing to be adventurous, head off the trail on snowshoes, and can handle a little risk, buy the whole album - not just one or two songs - put it on, sit in a dark room with a brandy, and let Kate's magic work on you.es home to her.

B005PTQPU0|1.0|I love me some Kate Bush...but this album SUCKS!!!!  It is really depressing and really boring and too freaking weird even for KATE, it is sooooo boring.  I will not be listening to it a second time.  I think one would need to be on heavy drugs to enjoy this crap!!!!  It is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. People only like this crap because it's strange and weird....sometimes strange and weird is just plain BAD and LAME...like this album here.  50 words for CRAP (the worst, most dull and ugly lullaby ever)! There is even this horrid song where she just says numbers 1 thru 50...and some dude just says a word for snow after each number until they get to 50. So Freaking pretentious, lame, and absurd.  Update today is FEB 17th.  I have listened to the album a couple of more times.  It is NOW going in the trash.  It truly is the WORST album I have EVER heard. It makes me want to vomit.  I really can't stand this album.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I always have problems using the hotel clocks, when on the road, and my phone alarm choices are limited.  The alarm fade-in is a real heart attack saving device as I always jump a mile when the alarm goes off in the morning.
B004EPYZTE|4.0|I have to admit, i saw the teaser, i saw the trailer, the poster, but never saw it in the theatre. I still have a soft spot for the Arnold films, and personally have tired of the remakes, reboots, and sequels of today. I just recently watched this... the dvd mind you, not the blu ray, and all i can say is I really enjoyed it. This is more of an attempt at remaking a franchise then continuing the arnold films... but not to a fault. The story begins with an origin, which is appropriate beings how most know the conan name, but not the story. The action is bloody, and vicious, the acting is surprisingly good, and the dialogue seemed witty and not as cliched as most might have you believe. Yes it has some fantasy elements, but instead of it being a 2 hour film opus of cgi it is used sparingly and where needed. the film does play out like one long action film, where you barely get enough time to breath before the next battle, which might have been a drawback for most films, but kept this one moving until the climax. Jason Momoa does a fine job at the role of conan, he has the muscular prowess of the character and is filled with the look of rage in battle and the charm when not, which is opposed to (however much it was a defining character for arnold) arnolds clunky \\"too big to move very fast\\" conan interpretation and Jason Momoa adds more personality to the role as well instead of being this brooding brute throughout the film. This film will not be for everyone, but it was entertaining. I went in with less than no expectations and found that... Conan... did surprise me.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|I wanted just the 3D version of Toy Story set and that's exactly what it is here. Wonderful 3D. And it's great NOT having all those extra disks to cluter up the place.  Also, if you have a 3D player you can switch these over to 2D Blu ray. Again, no extra discs.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|We were so glad to find this Gizmo toy online! My 8-year old recently watched the Gremlins series and fell in love with Gizmo.  The toy was very reasonably priced, and so adorable he immediately fell in love with it.  It is durable, and very handy that we can shut the song off when we want to. Glad we bought it!!
B005FVFWOI|5.0|I know that most of us here have purchased Aqualung what, 10 times already in our lives, if not more? It is perhaps the most classic of all classic rock albums.  It is certainly, as the liner notes by Dom Nawson say on this 40th Anniversary issue, the \\"most ferociously intelligent album\\" of the era.  But no matter how many times you have purchased this album in the past, I am going to tell you now to purchase it again - this issue of the album is and will remain the definitive one.  If anyone in these latter days ever wondered what the fuss was all about, this issuance will take those questions and stuff them in that trash can that John Evan had his picture taken in in Living in the Past.  Before, we were amazed by the songwriting, the lyrics, the performances and the raw power mixed with that amazing, ferocious intelligence (My God, Ian Anderson was 23 when he wrote these songs, what I would have given to be that talented and accomplished at such an age). Now, however, all that is multiplied by a sonic quality and clarity that is literally breathtaking in its scope.  Steven Wilson should be sent gifts every Christmas and the finest wine on his birthday by all of us Tull fans - and even just plain classic rock fans - for the rest of his life.  It is obvious, beyond his notes, that this was truly a labor of love...not a job. I have listened to countless \\"remasters\\" and special editions - even many remasters of Tull albums that were previously re-issued. Nothing that has come before prepares you for what you will hear in this issue. Ian's magnificent voice is here in all it's glory - clear and crisp and raw and precise. Where the multiple flute tracks blend and coalesce on My God, the sound becomes an astounding tapestry. Clive Bunker's drums jump off the CD at you. It is like I never heard the drums before...it is just that dramatic. Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond's base guitar roars - clearly and with definition.  Listen to this presentation and ask yourself what strange political correctness, or sheer ignorance, causes all of the \\"Top Guitarist\\" lists everywhere to ignore Martin Barre.  We have never heard before the minute pause of dramatic silence where the intro to Locomotive Breath segues to powerful train riff that defines the song.  We haven't been able before to isolate the performances on every instrument - to hear each contribution with complete clarity. What before was a wonderful mush of sound is now a far more wonderful collection of clear distinct instruments and voices. In every song there is so much more to hear than we ever imagined.   We had heard for many years about the terrible conditions and acoustics in the basement of the old church where Island Studios was recording in those days.  But oh what sound they actually captured there - and now we can truly hear it.   For those of new interest who have come for a review of the music - there is little I can say that hasn't already been said somewhere. This is the most classic of all classic albums. It is called progressive rock but that really isn't accurate. It is nothing like the Prog you have come to know as Prog. It is an interesting amalgamation of 60's ethos with the raging power found in many hard blues bands like Led Zeppelin or Cream, with a folk rock sense in the lyrics combined again with a touch of faux concept as found in true Prog.  And even that isn't quite adequate to define this. It is simply quintessential Ian Anderson and a magnificent band at the top of their young game.  Every song is a masterpiece of it's own type - and now you can hear what masterpieces they truly are.  In other words, all discussion of this music becomes subjective, not objective. It is just too powerful for objective discussion.  So tip a glass to Steven Wilson and thank him for returning to the park bench and giving us this revelation. No thanks are enough.
B0021L9MJG|3.0|Creepshow is a true classic horror movie, but the lack of spanish subtitles makes the movie useless for my friends, not everyone speaks english in my house and the producers should consider this as a standard feature for all the movies.  Carlos
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Awesome as usual. The game needs no improvement. Something a little different every time. Everyone looks forward to the new updates.
B005V20JKI|3.0|this game is interesing but had a bad 'learning curve'...didnt really explain what to do and that the enemies u couldnt touch or u died....but still i like the game alot
B005V20JKI|2.0|the graphics aland interface reflect a lot of work, and is very pleasing to interface with. playing the game isn't. controls send the character careening wildly fast in whatever direction. want to simply turn around to shoot an enemy? too bad! you'll go flying into him! and changing character with every muffin? why? I like one character, let me keep him always!
B0054JELS4|5.0|I bought this complete set as a birthday gift.  The price was okay for as many DVDs as are included (it was a Lightning deal or other sale, I think).  I like NCIS well enough, but didn't realize how many serious fans there are out there ... after I bought this for a friend, several people (including my dad) mentioned how much they would like to own all of the seasons.  {hint, hint}  One thing that did disappoint me about the set is that the different seasons were packaged in several different ways and then shrink-wrapped together.  The photo shows all of the seasons in uniform jacket boxes.  In reality, some of the seasons came in jacket boxes, others didn't, so they didn't really have the appearance of a \\"set.\\"  Since it was a relatively expensive gift for someone for a momentous occasion, I would have preferred a set that would look nice on display on their shelf.  For a lot of people, that isn't important, since they don't \\"display\\" DVDs ... but it would have been nice to give the recipient that option if they wanted.  Nonetheless, it was appreciated by the recipient and envied by others.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't know where to begin and I don't wanna leave a lengthy review and spoil the fun for anyone! It's a mystery and love story with a bit of sci fi all in one. If this isn't (The) greatest Stephen King novel it's definitely up there with the greatest of his works . This is not a small book but I finished in under a week, it was that good I was  kinda sad to finish it cause I didnt want it to end. Great Story!!
B000000WG4|5.0|This isn't for everyday listening often. It's prog rock and it's good stuff but like alot of prog rock you need to be in the mood for music that meanders around and does what it wants to. This of course was used in the exorcist but the two songs stand alone as good music in their own write.  If  you like prog rock or classical music then there's no reason not to enjoy this cd. Theres a mix of instruments and in truth this is somewhat a jam session of instruments and themes that are sometimes not connected. So it's experimental and that's what you get.  The remaster is a better deal though.
0547258305|5.0|There is nothing about Graceling I disliked. Nothing!<br /><br />I was transported to this world that literally had me holding my breath. Katsa, Graced with the skill of combat, is fascinating. Throughout the whole book she changes, she grows, and watching her find herself is just...wow. It's not a rapid change, she's made mistakes, done cruel things, but gradually you see her start to question herself, with the help of Prince Po, she does things that she wouldn't normally do, but his help is just the push she needs.<br />I can't say I was emotionally invested with the characters at the beginning. Katsa is a stand-offish person, and it comes through while your reading. As she starts making friends, starts to open up, you start being drawn in as well- you become her friend. Po, Katsa, Raffin, and Bitterblue are all characters that grab you and in the end, you don't want to let them go.<br /><br />Can I say how awesome the Graced are? Born with two different coloured eyes, some silver, some blue, some black, but always different. The Grace doesn't affect every one the same, some are skilled in swords, some in archery, some can predict the weather, some can read minds, it has me wishing for two different coloured eyes and a Grace in something spectacular and peculiar (plus a charming prince to keep me company).<br /><br />The one thing I really like is how gradual everything is, it's like hearing a big orchestra steadily building and the next thing you know your heart's pounding. If you've ever listened to \\"Into the Storm\\" by Robert W. Smith, Graceling reminds me of it. I was really surprised at the main conflict, it'll have you believing it's not true until you have proof otherwise.<br /><br />I can't come up with anything else to make this an appropriate review besides telling you how much I enjoyed the story, the characters, the places, and seeing the characters transform into human beings.
B000002G23|5.0|You get most of the police's output here and some rarities included. It's like many boxsets lots of the same stuff already out there and then some rare stuff to delight the hardcore fans.  That's what this release is and it's got all the studio releases of this great rock band and thankfully they did do a reunion tour. Which I saw in the 00's which was awesome. They still had it all the way. And for a solid fan this boxset is the way to go. If you are a completist you will wish they had put another disc on this one for the songs that not included.  Still somebody might put those songs out someday and bootleggers  will do it if they haven't already yet done so.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|For me this is their best album. The sound of this CD is very strong as ever in the productions of Nickelback. If this album had more hard songs would not be bad  but the melodic songs,that not are  always ballads,are very good.The CD begins with the blunt THIS MEANS WAR, this is one of the best already follow a lot of good songs like BOTTOMS UP, LULLABY, EVERY THING I WANNA DO give some examples. In conclusion a good job
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Kate Bush has been my favorite storyteller for many years now.  It is very fitting on this album that she would take her amazing gift at storytelling to new heights.  These songs are like short stories that unfold over mesmerizing vocals and piano arrangements.  There is not one song on this album that I don't enjoy.  This album was released to great critical acclaim among music journalists as well as fans.  That said, this album is very unique in many ways and probably not for everyone.  Those expecting to immediately find their way into the songs might find them a bit frustrating.  For long time fans who know that Kate's music slowly builds in arrangements, it will be an instant classic on first listen.    I can't remember a more haunting and ecstatic moment in music from recent years as the chorus on \\"Misty\\" in which Kate sings of \\"dead leaves, bits of twisted branches and frozen garden, crushed and stolen grasses from slumbering lawn\\" as if inciting an incantation while acoustic guitars pluck otherworldly chords.  Completely captivating and beautiful.  The stories here are rich and complex, and the sound of the album is quite dark.  Sit back, light some candles, listen carefully.  This is the kind of album you make into an experience, reading along to the lyrics while you listen.  Thank you Kate Bush for this amazing album!  I might add, buying the physical album is definitely worth it.  It it not your standard album in a jewel case, but rather the CD comes in a hardback book with gorgeous photos of snow sculptures, each corresponding to one of the 7 tracks.

0547258305|3.0|\\"Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight-- she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug.    \\"When she first meets Prince Po, Graced with combat skills, Katsa has no hint of how her life is about to change.    \\"She never expects to become Po's friend.    \\"She never expects to learn a new truth about her own Grace-- or about a terrible secret that lies hidden far away.\\"    --from the back of the book    My review: Graceling was a pleasant read, but it didn't succeed in drawing me in enough to the point that I developed either love or hatred for it. The overall premise is fascinating, what with Kristin Cashore's creation of the Graces and the inter- and intra-kingdom political situations. I think the way Cashore deals with the subject of love, sex, and marriage is extremely mature and very admirable. It would behoove more young adult authors to deal with such \\"delicate\\" yet realistic and everyday issues as directly and cleanly as Cashore does in Graceling. I think my biggest issue, on the other hand, is the lack of consistency in the prose and plot living up to the novel's premise. For pages on end at times, I found myself passively skimming the lines because the passages seemed so heavily cut and edited for the sake of streamlining plot that no attention was spared to preserve the beauty of the prose. In numerous other instances, I found myself getting pumped up for a particular scene only to be disappointed because the great reveal didn't seem at all deserving of the amount of suspense leading up to it. It doesn't seem like Cashore has a problem with writing; after all, the prose is absolutely lovely in various passages sprinkled throughout the novel. I just think she spends too many pages focusing on certain things and not enough pages on others. I giveGraceling three out of five stars. I enjoyed Graceling enough that I am curious to read Cashore's second book and to see how her writing develops.     For more book reviews, visit [...]
B005WZZRD8|4.0|I do really enjoy the Collection CD's that I got in the mail. I am a huge fan of gaga and I lov eher so much. I just didn't like the casing with this package. Why cardboard? Or-whatever this is. It's going to tear by the time I start to acutally want to use it. -.-

B005KN59FS|5.0|New York's Riot has seen many incarnations over the years. The fans of Riot will often refer to a \\"era\\" of the Band they like best. If you are new to the band read on and later you can google the band to learn all you need to know. If you are an old fan wondering if this is worth a purchase read right along and then open your wallet.   Riot's original 1988 Thundersteel era lineup of Tony Moore (Vocals), Mark Reale (Guitars), Mike Flyntz (Guitars), Bobby Jarzombek (Drums), Don Van Stavern (Bass) are all back and in absolute top form. Classic and great albums have all the ingredients from great song writing, excellent musical arrangements, searing attitude and professionalism with a touch of magic that just happens. Some line-ups just have this. This line-up is one of those bands. I cannot say enough about the musicianship, it's all here. There was great care taken on this album and it shows. A few bands could learn a few things from how to stage your comeback by listening to this album. This is, without any doubt, a cracking effort which stands right along side the classic Thundersteel album. For those of you that still buy CD's clear a spot on the shelf along side of Thundersteel and proudly (after you're done wearing the disc out) place this one right beside it.   There is not a single weak track to be found, plus there is a good bit of diversity here from the all out power metal of the opening track to the melodic haunting Echoes. The following are the highlights if you can really pick them: The frenetic, angry, pounding opener \\"Riot\\", the excellent \\"Crawling\\", the for Japan single \\"Wings are For Angels\\", the melodic \\"Sins of The Father\\", the hard rockin' Whiskey Man and the haunting Echoes. The Digi-pack comes with two live tracks which are Johnny's Back and Metal Soldiers, well worth the extra buck or two and goodness Tony Moore sounds great on these live tracks. A last note, this disc did not appear over compressed and did not distort when cranked.   Just a absolute phenomenal return-5/5.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Scotty's wonderful deep country voice comes out so beautifully on his new cd.  This young man is going places!  You won't regret getting this cd for your collection.  This is Scotty's first cd of probably many to come.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This was a fantastic product that any true FFVII fan cannot live without!  I had loved my original copy of Advent Children but once I saw the Complete edition, I can't not look down on the original Advent Children.  The Complete has a great story which helps all us confused fans understand why Denzel is there and how Kadaj and his gang survived after the Lifestream was supposedly purged of all Jenova cells at the end of the original game.  With all the extended and alternate scenes, many holes that some may not have even noticed existed in the film are sealed with finesse.  One can only truly appreciate the film by buying the Blu-ray DVD.  No one can call themselves a true fan by watching the scenes online.  Heck, I had even purchased a used Blu-Ray just to watch the movie and I don't regret either of them!  I cherish this movie and would recommend it to anybody!  I INSIST, IT'S WORTH THE BUY!!!  The seller was great, too!  I had the purchase at my doorstep within 24 hours using the 2 day shipping!  The purchase came in great shape. I have no complaints!
B00428ZRFY|5.0|This is one of Rihanna's best albums, and it comes with a Behind the Scenes DVD that gives you a look of her recording the album while being on her Rated R European tour. You also get to see her pose for the album booklet's photoshoot and you also get to see her make her video for the #1 Single \\"Only Girl In The World.\\" I would recommend buying this, and also the Couture Edition if you can still find it because that comes with what this one does, but its huge like a vinyl record would be [the photo book & case, not the cd] and it comes with a Signed Album cover that I have proudly framed in my room, it's worth every penny.
B00632HWOG|5.0|works just fine on kindle fire. does what I need it to do and seems better than kindle email app
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I LOVE this album, it is my second favorite next to Rihanna's \\"Rated R\\". I would recommend buying this item to everyone, you won't be disappointed. All songs are amazing good quality songs, you won't want to turn a single one unless you're too hyper to listen to slower songs lol. This is one of her best albums so don't have any doubts and GO BUY TALK THAT TALK!
1439192812|3.0|This is an incredible and quite beautifully illustrated book for all ages.  For content, coherence and lively storytelling (truth-telling, actually), I give it five stars.  Because of technical perplexities I am giving it only  three stars.  My complaint is that in ebook format I cannot re-read the book, unless I want to do it from last page to first.  There is no way to get from the end of the book back to the beginning, except for going backward a page at a time.  So far, I have made it back only to Chapter 9, sometimes not as far as that, only to get bounced out.  Even though I get the cover page, when I turn the first page I am back in the middle of the last chapter.  After five tries I give up.  I guess I can NEVER read this book again----how very irritating!!!
B002FOQY04|5.0|This album is amazing, I bought it as soon as it came out. The songs on the album are all very good and you wouldn't want to skip any of them. Kid Cudi has a different unique voice and flow, you can just chill out and listen to the album with ease and be totally relaxed while doing so. The DVD is also worth the buy because this dude is extremely hilarious. It shows him golfing and clowning around which will have you laughing throughout the whole scene. There are other things on the DVD as well, and you definitely won't be able to keep quiet since there are many funny scenes, I recommend purchasing this product.
B005974CDU|5.0|My review is a brief one, as you will have to listen to this Dream Theater album to believe me.  Although I expected a rather different DT style with this album (because of Portnoy leaving the band), it turns out to be a new DT original must-have.  Every single track of this ALBUM is a MAGNIFICENT AND BRILLIANT execution of a complex and (I quote) \\"SYSTEMATIC CHAOS\\".    Mr. Mangini's drum playing is just the PERFECT FIT to DT's prog-metal.  In my opinion, Mangini should be a lot louder in this album, though.  John Petrucci - SUPERB   John Myung - INCREDIBLE  Jordan Rudess (The Wiz) - OH MY GOD  James Labrie - SUPER  Mike Mangini - PERFECT  Just love the prog-metal turning into a subtle soft-jazz passage to introduce Labrie's vocals in \\"Outcry\\".  This is GENIUS.  Many other turning passages in the other tracks too.  Don't miss this album if you are a DT fan.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|....  good thing I'm not insecure.  But anyway the movie was entertaining and the cast was likeable and I think they somehow tried to tie in Everett-Wheeler M-theory with ancient European mythology,  loosely bound by your usual treachery and double crossings and people getting their bottoms kicked by each other.    If you're looking at this movie and still debating to watch it, just watch it.  There are worse films out there.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and the character and level design are great. My only compliant is that I would rather the attack and jump buttons were on top of each other and not next to each other. But you get used to it.<br /><br />EDIT: Just to note, there is an option to change the button position to wherever you want. It is really nicely adjustable. Although in the kindle fire at least you have to go through their setting button on the main screen and not through the buttons in the menu at the bottom of the screen.

Well, shouldn't that be mentioned in the ad?  Shouldn't a version that will play in the US?  I was saddened as I know this to be an exceptional movie.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|after viewing super 8 I thought the action footage was great. after reading the reviews I can see why the country is in such a mess. you get all these good reviews and not once in the good reviews do I see anyone comment on the rude and nasty behavior of these 12 year old kids. Im 65 and even today i would not treat anyone like these kids did in the movie. the script writers think that this is funny to treat other friends this way is a joke. i would not recommend this movie for anyone under 18 years of age. come on America clean up your act

0061969656|4.0|Bernard Cornwell's \\"Saxon Tales\\" series continues to explore the murky origins of England with \\"Death of Kings.\\" Our hero remains Uthred, Saxon raised as a Dane (Viking) who has reluctantly fought for Alfred the Great for years.  But what is he to do when the ailing Alfred finally passes and the Danes stand poised to invade a fractured kingdom?  For those of you who are familiar with this series, you know the answer:  fight and kill.  Uthred is the ultimate warrior, hiding his strategic mind behind a facade of barbarian fury.  \\"Death of Kings\\" features more of the same as Uthred tries valiantly to advise Alfred's heir Edward, who is unfortunately surrounded by a cast of advisors consisting largely of Cornwell's favorite villain, the corrupt clergy.  This does lead to a most enjoyable scene where Uthred offers his advice on how to run a church service (you have to agree, they'd be both shorter and more entertaining).  But through these battles - both political and bloody - we see how the foundations of England were forged.  And there is plenty of blood to satisfy Cornwell's fans, even though there is also a dizzying political landscape that makes the reader even more thankful when Uthred decides to solve problems with his lethal swords, Serpent's Breath and Wasp-Sting (as you can see, Uthred's a warrior, not a poet).  Cornwell admits in his author's notes that he's taken more than a few liberties with the historical record in the interests of storytelling.  That's fine, because Cornwell tells great stories.  But he raises a valid beef with the focus of English history, which generally kicks off with 1066 as the first year of note.  As Cornwell proves with this series, the reign of Alfred the Great is worthy of study as it is just as thrilling and essential as any other era of English history.    If you're wondering why I don't give this 5 stars, it's because the political elements of the book are a little rushed and I too often lost track of just who Uthred's enemieswere.  \\"Death of Kings\\" is still a lark, but at times it's surprisingly confusing for a Cornwell novel.

1400079276|2.0|Admittedly, Murakami is very learned, and he pays this off by incorporating nifty \\"did-you-know\\" trivia about famed historical figures and dramatic concepts (dramaturgy, irony as explained by Aristotle, metaphor).  The thrust of  KAFKA seems to be that the story is meta-referential to itself as fiction (i.e. as a dream or creation);  however, this alone is thin, and this is despite of Murakami's \\"literary trick\\" of making the book seem more significant than it is by weaving Oedipus and Orpheus and Kafka into the plot.<br /><br />I didn't care much for any of the characters--they were too flat and their emotions dictated too much by their function; lack of agency, which is kind of Murakami's point, is an interesting concept, but hard to execute because character IS agency (even the REAL Kafka wrote stories with character's struggling internally to make sense of the absurd). One can argue that these criticisms may have to do with the fact that the original work is Japanese and that I'm reading a translation; but I've read the translations of Soseki and Bassani, and all of them feel much more substantial that KAFKA.<br /><br />Though I didn't regret reading KAFKA, the most I can mustered at the end is \\"Meh\\", and \\"Neat, I suppose...\\" Hard to instill a sense of destiny without weight. I liked SPUTNIK SWEETHEARTS better.

0754540146|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2S53M00HG3ZCR]]IN TWENTY-SEVEN EU COUNTRIES:  THE MYSTERY REVEALED<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you wish to impress your colleagues with your encyclopaedic knowledge of VAT threshold levels (for example) in each and every one of all twenty-seven European Union states, this book is for you.  This may sound a little flippant, but not a bit of it.  In fact, Nancy Cruikshanks is to be congratulated for compiling and editing a work which largely transforms the often frustrating quest for accurate VAT information across the EU into the simple matter of referring to this one handy guide.<br /><br />As Cruikshanks points out, VAT compliance is a major headache for any business trying to expand its horizons by engaging in trade across the EU.  VAT may have been a `simple tax' initially, but add on such factors as multiple rates, exemptions, reliefs, disallowances and more --  and you have a cornucopia of variables which can only compound and confuse the ordinary financial interactions of trade.  Recently published by LexisNexis, `VAT in the EU' is indispensable if you wish to gain a basic understanding of the differences in the administration, or interpretation of VAT across the EU, particularly as the rules differ from country to country.<br /><br />The book begins with a list of all twenty-seven EU members and their respective standard rates of VAT.  (Did you know that Hungary and Sweden struggle with the highest rate of VAT at 25 per cent, closed trailed by Romania's 24 per cent?  Only Luxembourg and Cyprus enjoy the lowest rate of 15 per cent.)  VAT rates and rules are then examined in detail for each EU member state.  Each of the twenty-seven chapters is written by an expert contributor with local knowledge and each deals with the same key categories, from `getting started' and `general rules' to surcharges, penalties and refunds.<br /><br />Obviously the book is useful for those who are contracting for any VAT rated goods or services in the EU.  Accountants, as well as lawyers advising on contractual terms and obligations, will find it indispensible. Here, in one concise, convenient volume of over 1,000 pages is the information you need to know regarding VAT if you, or your clients conduct trade within the European Union.  As cross-border trade becomes ever more commonplace and potentially lucrative, acquiring a reliable reference source like this is vital.or services in the EU.

B000063JZQ|1.0|My wife, who is a high school English teacher, ordered this to show to her classes following their study of the play. The R rating is appropriate; don't plan on showing it in its entirety. Though you could probably show a few select scenes, definitely preview (luckily she did). None of the scenes with the witches are ok to show to a class. One of the witches is a hermaphrodite who lifts skirt and shows her junk, and in another scene--the part where Macbeth goes back to the witches to get more prophecies--the play's three witches are joined by about a hundred nasty naked old witches--gross. Also, the fighting scenes are super cheesy. Actually, the whole thing is pretty cheesy. Not worth the money for you hard-working teachers.
B005V20JKI|3.0|This game gets high marks for looking good - the style is great, the animations are good and all the characters are well done and mostly amusing. Where it falls flat is that critical element of gameplay; its just not that fun. The level design is uninteresting and while its &quot;hard&quot; its not &quot;challenging&quot;. Changing characters all the time is clever, but not having control over it makes it pointless. The makers of this game need to go back and learn from some old school classics; get on that mame box and play some Donkey Kong, Burger Time, Q-Bert, etc and understand whet makes single screen platformers fun.
B004GXA5U2|3.0|This is a hard review to write, because on many levels Allison Pearson really does hit the mark in terms of detailing what it is like to be a modern mother - the guilt, the messes, lack of time and sleep, the sense of being obliged to do too much and keep everyone happy. It is very close to the bone.   Although I did enjoy this aspect of the book and could strongly  relate to it,  I found myself increasingly aggitated by the main character Kate Reddy. There was no compromise or give and take with her, especially in regards to her husband. In fact most of the men described in the book were one-dimensional, and compared to my experience very old fashioned.  Kate charges around like a bull at a gate, seemingly oblivious to what is really going on around her or bothering to have any real communication about what is going on or what can be done about it- she just takes charge. For me that is where she separates from my experience as a working mum.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|This add-on works- for some things, but accuracy is reduced.<br /><br />It's only good if you want to play with more than one person in a tight space, but don't expect to get any record breaking scores on your games with it.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|If you loved the second disc of \\"Aerial,\\" you will absolutely LOVE \\"50 Words for Snow.\\"  It's another masterpiece from the woman whose poetry and keenly observant eye can create such a warm soundtrack for something so magickal and so beautiful as winter.  It's breathtaking and sonically mesmerizing.  Only Kate could make sparks such as these in the snow.  I especially love \\"Snowed in On Wheeler Street,\\" a duet with Sir Elton John, \\"Wild Man\\" and the title cut.\\"  It's like listening to one extended piano-laden lullaby!<br /><br />As always, I applaud and celebrate the wonderful uniqueness of her gifts!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great writing, fantastic story, and well-researched novel. I recommend this book to anyone who has swayed away from King. This book is written with a lot of heart and it shows.
B005PTQPU0|4.0|Let's get the first question out of the way. Will you like \\"Snow\\"? I suppose it depends on what expectations you bring to the album. If you come to it expecting \\"The Hounds of Love\\" (or even \\"Aerial\\") or her earlier work than it's possible that this won't be for you. My advice if you're uncertain is to listen to samples of the album, allow them to sink in and then decide to move forward. For those who do join Bush on this journey you won't regret it.<br /><br />Love her or hate her Kate Bush isn't afraid to challenge audience expectations and listen to her muse. Closer in feel to although starker sounding than \\"Aerial\\" her double CD released in 2005, \\"50 Words for Snow\\" will also probably polarize many fans because it takes some unexpected twists and turns. The songs are all set against a background of--surprise--snow or winter environments from the bizarre but touching \\"Lake Tahoe\\" about a woman drowned in an icy lake and the remains of her spirit that haunt the area to \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\" about lovers who constantly fail to connect, the material reflects Bush's sensitive touch.<br /><br />The only flaws I felt are the longer sometimes meandering songs (which could have benefited from a bit of editing) and that the almost monochromatic feel of the material. I recognize that was Kate's intention but throwing in a bit more diversity in the arrangements and/or material might have benefited the album. Oh, one other complaint is as much as I like Kate experimenting I didn't care for the title track all that much. It's a weird interesting idea that (for me) just didn't work.<br /><br />Featuring guest appearances by Elton John (he performs a duet with Bush) and Andy Fairweather-Low, the album is nicely packaged although if you want the lossless version it is a separate release. The mastering by Doug Sax and James Gutherie is refreshingly old fashioned in that it eschews the trend towards loud, harsh mastering in favor of capturing the natural flavor of the finished album.<br /><br /> My only complaint is that the CD slides out of the packaging which would add wear and tear to it.shed album.<br /><br /> My only complaint is that the CD slides out of the packaging which would add wear and tear to it.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I have used Docs to Go on Palm and Android; pretty sure I had it on my work Blackberry too (hated the Blackberry). Docs to Go opens PDFs quicker than other apps and renders the doc clearly. The Excel app remembers my last saved place - unlike the other mobile office apps - which is really helpful with long data sheets.  Is mobile Office perfect? No, but mobile Office may never be perfect until Windows 8 comes out. I depend on Docs to Go until then. I tried the pro versions of all the rest, and always go back to Docs to Go.
B005N95JA4|4.0|Disagree? Write a review or leave a comment. Remember, this is just MY opinion.<br /><br />First, the 5 star review is for the album itself and its content NOT for the mastering which isn't ideal.<br /><br />I've always felt that this was the next-to-last great Stones album. \\"Some Girls\\" is one I've always loved maybe it's the teenager in me that it appeals to me but either way the deluxe edition both dazzles and disappoints a little as well.<br /><br />To the meat of the matter so-to-speak the REAL reason to get this is the second disc. They may be outtakes but are very good and would have made terrific b-sides and even a strong follow up album to \\"Some Girls\\" if they had been completed at the time. As others have pointed out it is missing \\"Everything Turns to Gold\\" and the various remixes of \\"Miss You\\" and \\"Shattered\\" that are floating out there. Since this is likely the last physical release on CD we'll see of this album, it's a bit disappointing that this isn't more comprehensive.<br /><br />I feel the second disc should have been released indiviually like \\"Exile\\" as I really didn't need a another copy (and an inferior mastering)of the original album on CD.<br /><br />This remaster is a bit harsh, louder and compressed using the same 2009 remaster done by Stephen Marcussen. This album is available at iTunes (which offers a bonus alternate mix of one track included here not available anywhere else)and as a lossless download at HDTracks for both the original album and bonus tracks (I haven't heard the lossless version--if they used the Marcussen mastering I wouldn't bother. There's also a pending SHM-SACD from Japan as well).<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of digipaks but they did do a nice job of repackaging this with a nice deluxe booklet for the CD edition.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you're buying this as a Christmas gift for a Stones fan they'll enjoy it (although I'd probably recommend the deluxe edition with the DVD which features a vintage concert and a terrific book although, curiously, the photos in the booklet are from the 1975 tour of the band).tour of the band).

More importantly he has to discover WHO or WHAT the \\"Silence\\" is and why, well, they've chosen to silence HIM. The doctors lies, dies and Amy Pond cries. Steven Moffat comes up with an intriguing story arc that has a strong beginning, lags a bit in the middle but picks up again by the last third.<br /><br />End of Spoilers:<br /><br />While the sixth season of \\"Doctor Who\\" isn't flawless, it's ALWAYS entertaining even during the lesser episodes in this set. Writer/producer Moffat has made \\"Doctor Who\\" his own show (much as his predecessor Russell T. Davies did) in a sense rebooting the series with a new Doctor (Matt Smith)during the fifth season, a pair of new companions (Karen Gillian as Amy Pond and Arthur Darvil as Rory) who plays a role almost as important as the Doctor himself. It's a clever story arc that at times gets lost in its own cleverness but always returns to what makes the series fun. Smith has made the role his own which given the performances of his predecessors is saying something.<br /><br /> Moffat ties together the story strands from previous seasons including the origin of Dr. River Song (Alex Kingston). Any season that features one of my favorite actors Mark Sheppard (\\"Battlestar: Galatica\\", \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Burn Notice\\" among other shows--please someone get this man a series!)is given a bit of leeway.<br /><br />I do hope though that Moffat will move away from the all powerful Doctor as it would eventually become something of a narrative dead end for the show. There is a bit of noticeable banding now and again but on the whole the presentation is exceptionally good.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"Doctor Who\\" receives a marvelous looking transfer for home video in high def. Colors pop (well, when they're supposed to)and the show looks remarkably sharp with strong fine detail.<br /><br />Audio sounds quite strong with a nice immersive 5.1 lossless mix but dialogue is quite strong.<br /><br />Special features include a number of fun, informative commentary tracks for the following episodes: \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\",\\"The Doctor's Wife\\",\\"The Rebel Flesh\\", \\"A Good Man Goes To War\\", \\"The Wedding of River Song\\".

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|\\"Super 8\\" is the best Spielberg movie that Spielberg never made (or at least the best since \\"Stand By Me\\"). J.J. Abrams has proven to be something of a film and TV chameleon able to imitate the stuff he liked from his youth while also adding something new and unique about which makes it like good comfort food--it's familiar but not TOO familiar. There are some minor problems with the third act of the film but, on the whole, this throw back bit of entertainment recalls what Spielberg (and even Rob Reiner did so well with \\"Stand By Me\\" the OTHER best film that Spielberg never made)did well before he became a \\"serious\\" artist; Abrams creates compelling characters with nicely detailed teenagers and although the adults are a little less well developed, they are pretty well done.<br /><br />Set in the late 1970's, \\"Super 8\\" follows a group of kids making a zombie movie that they are going to enter in a Super 8 film competition. The kids witness a train crash while filming at an old train station and SOMETHING comes out of one of the cars. This thing begins taking people from the down, stealing microwaves and other devices. When the military show up, it's pretty clear that something BIG has gone wrong.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning and is very much a demo quality Blu-ray. Colors pop, detail is remarkably sharp and abundant (well, except for the Super 8 footage some of which was actually shot on 16mm so they could add visual effects--by the way the Super 8 movie is at the conclusion during the titles and is a chuckle particularly if you were from that generation that made their own little movies).<br /><br />Audio is positively stunning with a lossless mix.<br /><br />Special features are quite good-- we get deleted scenes (all in HD) as well as a series of featurettes covering the train wreck sequence from conception to execution showing us various stages of completion and featuring Abrams, the visual effects superiors, etc. We also get a digital copy (it's a digital download that you need the code sheet for which is inside) and a DVD copy of the film. There are also eight featurettes that focus on the creation of the film from the story to the final product. Finally we get an engaging commentary track by J.J.

076790592X|5.0|\\"An old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson. When I first picked up Tuesday's with Morrie, the unique title was the first thing to catch my eye. It left me wondering what life's greatest lesson was. The book didn't explain exactly what the lesson was, but rather gave different insights on what life really means. Tuesdays with Morrie is a book that will change how you see the life you currently live in. Inspired by the teachings of Morrie Schwartz, Mitch Albom recreates the events of his dying college professor who was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). I loved how Morrie thought about the world around him. He gave different ideas on how people take most things for granted and never appreciate the small things in life.    Mitch made this book as a dying wish from his professor. Morrie wanted his thoughts and ideas to be shared with everybody. It's one of those types of books that will fly by fast and have your attention until the very last page. The only downside to the book is that it feels short and it'll leave you wanting for more. I would recommend this story to anybody that wants to read a good book.
1594484805|5.0|I enjoyed this book, there's a lot of good ideas in here.  Nothing earth-shattering, but a lot of information more people should be paying attention to.
0321687299|4.0|First, I'd like to say I've owned this book for a quite some time now. I haven't found a HTML5 overview book as good as this one for quick viewing, getting answers, and even just general reading without wanting to fall asleep. The Index is nice and easy to use to scan for different elements and their meanings throughout the book as well.   My only gripe with this book, doesn't have to do with the contents of it, but rather the actual book itself. The Printing & Covers are horrible. I have many pages which have print that is blurred, and make it very agitating to read. On top of that, the clear coat of the cover is peeling off literally, simply from sitting on a desk or standing in a bookcase. Definitely depressing in an otherwise great book.
0062060562|5.0|First thing that comes to mind is OMG! What an amazing amazing read. I can honestly say that this book had me at the edge of my seat. To say it's a definite page turner is an understatement. I stayed up till past 1 am to finish reading. Once I picked this book up I wasn't able to put it down. I read it everywhere, while cooking, walking to the bus, etc. It was that good. The ending was a great ending. I didn't exactly expect it. It was just an amazing book. And I'm super excited to say this book was picked up for a movie which starts/started film/filming this year. So I can't wait for it to come out on theater. Hopefully they won't change it much.<br /><br />  Can you imagine yourself waking up every morning and not knowing who you are? Where you are and who is this person sleeping beside you? Well that's Christine's life. She suffers from amnesia due to an \\"accident\\" and she wakes up everyday not knowing anything from her life. Every morning her husband has to answer questions as to who she is, who he is, where she is and what happened. She doesn't remember much, just fragments of memories. The one thing that does help is the journal she keeps in a shoebox in her closet. And a Doctor she has been secretly working with to find out how to help her regain her memory.<br /><br />  Almost every morning she wakes up and she gets a phone call telling her that she has a journal in her closet to help her remember or cope with what she has forgotten and feeling. As she reads this journal of the previous days she discovers she has been lied to. She sees that she's been working with Dr. Nash and doing different tests to try and help her with her amnesia. What she doesn't know is that Dr. Nash knows a bit more about her past and uses that information to bring out some memories. As he continues to push further into the study, she begins to have more and more different new memories in which he encourages her to write in her journal. He explains how revisiting certain places and people in her past might help regain more memory. But the deeper they go into the study the more information comes out and the more dangerous it becomes.<br /><br />  This is a nail biting, heart racing experience. S.J. Watson did an amazing job with this book and I am so glad that I was able to read it, courtesy of Netgalley. I can't wait for the movie to come out. If you're looking for a thriller and suspense, then this is YOUR book! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! A definite definite MUST BUY!

B005N95JA4|5.0|Ok, not too much here that we Stones fans haven't already heard before.  If you are a Stones fan...you're either a \\"pebble\\" or a \\"boulder\\" myself being the later and the previous would be the nay-sayers about this re-release.  Let's set the record straight here...yes, the material is basically the SOStuff that was originally released albeit THIS time with a different EQ setting on the final dub...maybe an older Mick singing along on a few tracks here and there.  I already own all of the boots, their mono LPs, the stereo ones, the London CDs, the ABKCO CDs, the CBS, the Virgin ones and a few of the Universal ones.  I've got enough Stones material to host a weekend radio show.  I've heard just about every way you could pluck a Stones song and...I like them all.    I give it 5 stars for two reasons.  (Aside from the fact that The Glimmer Twins managed to pull yet another $20 from my wallet :)  1) Essentially this is an encore performance from the 1978 release (and YES, like I said before, I own the vinyl versions AND all of the CD releases I full well realize there are sonic variations from all the Stones material that I own.  It WAS and STILL IS a GREAT ALBUM.    2) Its arrival in my mailbox today...well...made me feel something I have not since the 1980's.  The giddy excitement, the rush of adrenaline...the absolute joy when I saw that manila envelope in my box.  I sincerely haven't felt that particular way since I was 16 and saw the Columbia House cassette box on the kitchen table when I got home from school.  I pre-ordered this re-release several months ago. The anticipation of its arrival, in the past few weeks caused me to blow the dust off of my old Stones CD's and give them a re-listen...I have re-discovered why I like The Stones to begin with.  I'm a happy camper!  Sure, it may disappoint some fans but I'm reminded...\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\".......but sometimes you get what you need and for me, that quick take-back to my teenage years was WELL WORTH the price of admission ($22).  Cheaper than any drug and a lot more convenient than a visit to the shrink!  Not even Jesus Christ could please EVERYBODY!  Why should a mere mortal even be expected to???

B005ORVMT2|4.0|I also have a defective Fly by night _CD_.    Listen carefully for glitches here:  * Anthem - at ~2:02s (the glitch is on the word \\"more\\")  * Fly by night - at ~1:11s (the glitch is on the word \\"by\\")  * Rivendell - at ~1:15s  * In the end - ~1:25s  Since I get no read errors while ripping (I have error detection enabled) I can only assume it's \\"baked\\" this way.  Other than this it's a great improvement over the previous remasters.  UPDATE 11/28/2011: I got my replacement today and unfortunately it has the same glitches.  I also hear the glitch at 0:07s for Beneath, Between, & Behind that others have reported.

B005D0RDKW|4.0|I saw this show performed live in Boston, and was simply astounded that these guys can still go after all this time.  In fact, this band seems literally ageless, and are arguably more popular than ever.  This disc in particular highlights their popularity, as the boys played their most popular album, \\"Moving Pictures,\\" front to back, in addition to some new material never heard before.  Obviously, one disc cannot fully capture the energy and excitement of seeing Rush live, but this disc is a close second.  If you're reading this review, you probably are a Rush fan, anyway, and knowing Rush fans, you are probably considering buying it anyway, so I say go for it.  But if you're simply a fan of music, and great live music in particular, you could do a lot worse than checking out this disc.  It is an example of what great musicians can do, without crutches, without other ham-and-eggers joining them onstage.  It is an absolute spectacle.
B00169N0BK|5.0|(Note: I'm using OS X Lion)<br /><br />Monitor Calibration: Even though the options are very limited (only 4 or 5 settings each for white point and luminance) the Colormunki does a very accurate job, better than the Datacolor Spyder 3 I have (which I would not recommend).<br /><br />Printer Calibration: It's done a great job of maxing out the potential of this inexpensive Lexmark C543 color laser printer that I have, which the manufacturer provides no standard ICC profiles for. I can't wait to get a real photo quality inkjet now. I also wish I had just bought this in the first place instead of the Spyder 3.<br /><br />The \\"2 target\\" printer calibration system and strip scanning capability of the instrument makes profiling printers very quick and easy, even with manual operation. (No click click click on 100+ color patches. Just run the thing over 5 strips, print another target, run it over 5 strips again.) The only drawback to this dual target system is that you won't be able to print a target on a printer at a computer lab somewhere then take it home to create the profile. (Though there may be some unsupported way around this, you'll still end up running back-and-forth as the content of the second target depends on what readings you get from the first one.) So to profile a printer you'll have to have the Colormunki connected to the same computer as the printer.<br /><br />To those having problems with printer profiling: You are *almost certainly* printing your targets without turning off ALL of the color management in the print driver and on the printer. I thought I knew how to do this on my system, and I still managed to mess it up the first time. If the first target doesn't print with at least some bright primary colored patches then you didn't manage to get all of the color management stuff turned off. Go through the settings with a fine-tooth comb and disable everything related to color correction. Also, you may want to reset both your printer and printer driver to default factory settings before going through everything to disable the color correction stuff. Resetting to defaults may save you a major amount of trouble.<br /><br />Once I got the printer driver settings figured out, profiling worked perfectly.<br /><br />Another thing, depending on the type of printer you have, the Colormunki profiling software may generate a CMYK profile instead of an RGB profile. Unfortunately, lots of software (including print drivers) doesn't work with CMYK profiles (for example, Lightroom is only compatible with RGB profiles). If you have an ink jet printer then it's probably using an RGB data stream and you'll end up with an RGB profile, but other things like laser printers will give you a CMYK profile that you may only be able to use with something like Photoshop (which will convert RGB color spaces into CMYK.) This tripped me up for a while until I figured out what was going on. For now I'm stuck with having to print everything through Photoshop (or some other CMYK producing software) to use my profile to print my photos to the laser printer, but the results are good enough that I don't mind too much.<br /><br />Spot Measurements: The munki also comes with Photo ColorPicker for measuring any random opaque objects you want to know the exact color of. The only real problem that I see with this is that the device can have trouble collecting spot measurements from some non-flat surfaces. For example, I tried to read the patches off of my ColorChecker Passport and the thing isn't flat enough (due to the plastic case) to get the measurement port solidly against each patch. This doesn't affect monitor and printer profiling in the least, but it could be a little annoying for those trying to measure the color of random objects. To get something without this issue, though, you'll be spending a lot more on a spectrophotometer. In any case, the software it comes with for spot measurements is pretty good, and it does work on most things.<br /><br />Bundled Software Quality: The included software runs smoothly and does what you need for multiple monitor and printer calibration, I just wish it included some utilities for emissive spot measurement and creating basic Spectral Power Distribution plots. (Photo ColorPicker is great for \\"collecting\\" spot colors from objects, but it only supports reflective measurements and doesn't do SPDs.) All of the software that comes in the box is pretty simple and doesn't offer a lot of fancy advanced features. The most elaborate software in the box is probably the ColorPicker.<br /><br />Other Software: NEC's SpectraView II (for calibrating their displays) recognizes the ColorMunki and it does a pretty good job on their own MultiSync PA241 even compared to their own custom colorimeter puck. Currently I'm trying to evaluate whether or not it's even worth buying NECs puck if you already have a ColorMunki, but I haven't come to any conclusions yet. (Their puck is more accurate at really low luminance levels like 10cd/cm3, but that's about it.)<br /><br />Even without the SPD plot and emissive spot measurement features in the bundled software, I was still able to get SPD plots and emissive spot measurements (among other things) by downloading Argyll CMS (free). The only issue with Argyll CMS is that it's lacking a slick GUI (you'll have to open a terminal and use command line tools like 'spotread -S' to get SPD plots, even on Mac), but it seems to work perfectly with the Colormunki. It's also free, whereas similar CMS software with a nice GUI will cost you $100-$500 or more.<br /><br />Other Goodies: It looks like they're now shipping the Colormunki with a small ColorChecker Classic calibration card (for creating DNG camera calibration profiles) making it an even better deal. I had previously bought a [[ASIN:B002NU5UW8 X-Rite ColorChecker Passport]] for around $100 which is almost (but not quite) the same as what's now included for \\"free\\" with the Colormunki.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to anyone needing an affordable solution for display and printer calibration. If you think you'll do any color printing at all, ever, or ever need to measure spot colors, then just skip the display-only colorimeters and get this thing! Otherwise you may end up buying this eventually anyway, and selling off your colorimeter.t you need for multiple monitor and printer calibration, I just wish it included some utilities for emissive spot measurement and creating basic Spectral Power Distribution plots.

This service is a complete joke, I am not even kidding when I say there is not one part of this whole process that works as advertised.

Well I've tried them all and still have a service that doesn't work, and a &#34;digital copy&#34; that I PAID for still MIA.  As for this movie? 5 Stars.

0446573019|4.0|John Puller the hero in Zero Day is an interesting character.  All of the leading men in Baldacci series are somewhat similar.  Puller lacks a sense of humor but is a terrific fighting machine.  He is a very analytical investigator.  The side characters are fun.  This is certainly the beginning of a new series because Puller's father and brother will be the subject of later installments.  Possibly the Camel Club is the best of Baldacci's series but Puller is more serious.  It is almost as entertainment.  I have to admit the end was  little disappointing.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book just blew me away.  I am the same age as Stephen King and have liked just about all his books and feel he has always touched something pertinent to me in them.  I always felt The Stand was his greatest work, but after reading this I have to think about it a bit.  It's a thrilling story and touches so many emotions.  He has always been misunderstood as the scary, weird, horror guy, but this book , like many others , shows his skill at capturing emotions.  I always have problems with stories of time travel and the paradoxes it presents, but King has found a way to get by all the scientific junk and just run with a good story.  Actually, stories within stories.  Don't pass this one up!  Keep up the good work.
0553801473|1.0|He fancies himself Tolkein, however he's just another wannabe even going so far as to add the second \\"R\\" to his name. He even borrows some things from LOTR for example his \\"Kings Moot\\" compared to Tolkeins \\"Ent Moot\\". Tolkein was smart keeping the story moving and ending it in three books. Martin will be lucky to finish in seven books if at all. The fourth book was very disappointing because what happened to all the characters?????? I gave it one star should be a 0 since I'm done now, I've lost interest and won't buy any more.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|This is definitely one of the most uninspired albums I've heard in a long while and a true disappointment for me. It's not because of all the hype, not even because of the \\"new\\" direction they've taken and surely has nothing to do with the R&B nods here and there. The songs themselves are just bland, totally forgettable filler brought to their maximum potential by the overly polished production and sweeping, epic synth sounds. Where X&Y was overly \\"U2ish\\", Viva La Vida a nice and welcome change this unpronounceable record is just one big mess buried in gloss and pomp.<br /><br />However, no matter what they do, for me, Coldplay will always be the band who made \\"A Rush of Blood...\\" and \\"Parachutes\\", the gorgeous debut -- two of the most touching records of the 2000s. All goods things have an end, but the fall from grace could not have been any more striking.

1400069181|5.0|Warning: Don't read this review or this book unless you are ready to have some kind of change in your life.     About a week and a half ago I received two copies of the book \\"Start Something That Matters\\" by Blake Mycoskie. I was of course excited to read this book because of the TOMS story, but what I didn't expect was the book to have such an impact on my heart.  The opening of the book sets the tone off just right. Starting with the TOMS story and how Blake began his mission to give shoes to children helps shape the book into the inspirational theme it holds within the rest of the 165 pages. Blake writes the TOMS story with his heart on his sleeve, giving the details of his journey and even inserting a few journal pages and other visuals from the start of the the company. His humor shines throughout the first chapter but is mixed with sincere moments of motivation. \\"If you're like me and most people I know, you yearn for something more than jsut business success. You're searching for meaning. You want to have the time and freedom to do the things you love and contribute to making the world a better place,\\" write Blake, and it's true. This isn't a book for people just simply looking to start a new business, but for people looking to change the world at all costs, hence the title :\\"Start Something That Matters\\".  As teh book progresses the heart is impacted more and more but not just a simple movement to emotions happens. No, as Blake intertwines both his story, the beginning of TOMS and some stories of people who also started something that mattered to them and the world in some shape or form, the reader's heart feels as if it is starting to be changed. As I read page after page about a company I love mixed in with companies I see but never think about (and one I work for!) my heart wanted to join in their forces to change the world and Blake gives steps to do so.  From finding your story, to how to build trust in your company or movement, to having limited resources and staying frugal throughout, Blake builds this motivation in the spirit of whoever reads this book. I wish I could just reiterate the entire book for you! It's jsut so full of tips and websites and stories to check out and use that it is a must read for everyone who is wanting to do something big in the world.  But this book could be useful for even those who are already married to their favorite job but are hoping to make some little changes to it. Blake writes on how to treat your employees with helpful tips like getting rid of titles, treating your staff to fun things, giving time for the staff to give back and even making them feel like they can trust the people that work with them.  The book closes out with another story. This time a story that came to life because of a young man who found himself inspired by the TOMS story (which wraps the book up full circle). It's the final tug on the heart of the reader, the final call to motion in the reader's life and the beginning smile of a new venture for the person who is willing to take Blake's message and run with it.  Blake leaves the reader with a final life lesson: putting on your shoes to go. \\"Someone once told me the key to staying healthy was tying his shoes. What he meant was, one he actually put his shoes on and tied them, then he would go out for a run. And by going for a run, he was able to stay very healthy. The same philosophy applies here.\\"  Not being an avid reader of inspirational or even business books, I found this book helpful in many ways. I wanted to read it because of the TOMS story but found myself glued to every page, and if it wasn't for work I would have finished it in one sitting. It's definetly worth a second, third or even fourth read, but most of all its worth taking on Blake's challenges and finding not only your passion, but your story and then Starting Something That Matters. As Blake signs out his letters \\"Carpe Diem\\", seizing the day is exactly what you will be trying to do when you close this short, but impactful book that should never clutter your bookshelf but be work out sitting on the coffee table, travelling in your bag or being carried by hand. It's a guide worth keeping around at all times. A must- read.
B005NF2UE6|3.0|The Canadian Quartet's follow-up to their multi-platinum powerhouse, Dark Horse, leaves something to be desired.  While the sound is unmistakably Nickelback, and the lyricism is true to their songwriting form, listening to the CD makes you feel as if you've heard it all before, and you have, just not with the same words.  Don't get me wrong, if you like Nickelback, then you'll like the CD, but if you are looking for the original content, hit singles, and lyrical livelihood found on \\"Here And Now's\\" predecessor, I think you'll be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />I would give this a 3 1/2 star rating, but Amazon doesn't allow for half ratings, so we had to settle with 3, as I feel 4 would be a bit on the generous side.<br /><br />Don't be too hard on Nickelback though.  Following up something like Dark Horse is no easy task, even for skilled musicians.  I think perhaps a little more time and effort could have gone in to this one though.

B005R4255C|5.0|I'm a HUGE MJ fan. I think its a wonderful album. I love how some of the songs are mixed in with some of the other tracks. I think it interesting. Even how you can hear some of the stuff from the music video's and movie bits that are also incorporated into tracks. It was definately worth my money. I'm really looking for to see the Immortal tour in a few weeks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing.  Completely absorbing and fast-paced.  I read through this novel in a single sitting and absolutely devoured the rest.  I don't know if I'd really recommend this book for younger children though.  It's pretty violent.  It reminded me a lot of Lord of the Flies in a (good) way.  A good bit of political commentary too.

0385504225|2.0|First I'm not a Dan Brown fan.  I think he is a horrible writer.  However, I do enjoy the content of some of his books.  He presents interesting theories, and some great conspiracies.  Usually, the pace is fairly quick too, so I don't get terribly bored.  Unfortunately, the Lost Symbol fails on so many fronts that no amount of interesting conspiracy theories can really save it.  The book is choppy, very formulaic, and plods with heavy handed hints that SOMETHING IS HAPPENING.  It's also very predictable (though, I guess that's sort of a given with the formulaic).   I felt like I was reading through a really bad precursor to National Treasure... Dan Brown really should have stuck to Europe and the Catholic Church.

B005PTQPU0|2.0|Normally, I'd say I am a Kate Bush fan, but after some consideration this might be past tense.  Was.<br /><br />While I got through her last original release, 'Aerial', I thought to myself, \\"I had to get through it?\\"  That didn't seem right.  Bush is one of those artists whose albums I look forward to, not only because of the usual artistry that come with them, but because of their infrequency.  ...and there within lies some of the problem.<br /><br />One waits so long for a disk from Bush that you purchase it without sampling it (which, back in the day, you could not really do) and then you get stuck with the legend of Kate Bush and not necessarily where or how she have evolved.  I have no one but myself to blame for this.  Her current style may no longer be my style or liking - there's nothing wrong with that.<br /><br />Where 'Aerial' had some shining moments, I'm not finding these in her new release '50 Words for Snow'.  If snow is cold, distant and monochromatic, then Bush nails it with this \\"concept\\" album.<br /><br />Seven tracks at over 65 minutes (the shortest track almost 7 minutes, the longest being over 13) and of course, I want to like it more than I do - which isn't much.<br /><br />I will offend many of those 5-star ratings folks (and expect to be flooded with unhelpful votes) who will bless her ever move no matter the circumstances, but it is Windham Hill music with a slight edge - and that's only really the vocals.  The music is barely more than piano, which is fine and even that can be interesting until you realize is the same parts over and over for 6-13 minute stretches (note the beautiful start of \\"Snowflake\\" that just repeats and repeats and repeats).<br /><br />For me, \\"Among Angels\\" is the only listenable track that shows cohesion and melodic process the entire way through.  It is not to say it is exciting, but it'd be great for your Shavasana.<br /><br />\\"Wild Man\\" starts out ok and then just deteriorates.  And for the flack I've read about having Elton John \\"sing\\" on this record, \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\" is just dull and John is just almost a non-entity.  He only sounds like his self a note or two and could be almost any singer in this setting.  Throwing in a 9/11 reference doesn't work, but overall the song doesn't work either.<br /><br />The title track is just iffy at best.  Her song about Pi on 'Aerial' was much more entertaining than actually counting down the 50 words for snow.<br /><br />This all might work for background music (like Windham Hill) , but this is not sit and listen music.  Not for me anyways.<br /><br />I'd say '50 Words for Snow' is for the hardcore Bush fans only, but until this disk, I would have considered myself one of those - and I'm not taken with it at all.<br /><br />Save your $10.99.  Save yourself 65 minutes.  You can thank me later.Street\\" is just dull and John is just almost a non-entity.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I devoured the first 2 books.  And I felt I was being set up for a really dramatic finish, considering everything the charactors had to go through to get there.  As if going through 2 Hunger Games didn't have enough suffering and sacrifice, the main charactors are now fighting in a civil war AND fighting for their sanity.  It just isn't enjoyable reading at that point.  Someone is always crying or wondering how sane they are, or are doped up on morphling.  And the end of the story was AWFUL!!  First of all, I expected an ending that justified all the horrors I had to experience.  It didn't necessarily have to be a happy ending, but it did have to be worth the price the characters paid for it, that's all.  I'll admit I am a sap for endings where good triumphs over evil.  In this book, good barely scrapes by.    And I have to comment on the love story.  Suzanne Collins had something really special going between Katniss and Peeta.  She could have totally turned it into something divine.  But instead, she broke them.  ARGHH!!  I don't like the fact that she broke Peeta, who was the only unwavering witness to truth, freedom, and love.  And then she could've taken that opportunity to have Katniss finally \\"get it\\" and reciprocate the same unconditional love back to Peeta in his brokeness, but she didn't.  She broke Katniss, too.    I've got a busy life with enough of my own problems.  I read fiction to get away from all that.  I need to know that there is still a redemptive goodness in the world, even if its hidden in an author's imagination.  The first 2 Hunger Games books were great, they gave me the sense that freedom and love can triumph in a violent and unfair world and that one or two people can make a positive difference in the world around them.  It also encouraged my sense of standing up against injustice.  The third book was a nightmare I kept trying to wake up from.  I was disoriented by the meaningless and excessive cruelty.  I didn't understand why none of thecharacters were acting \\"in character.\\"  Anyways, I suppose you gotta read it after the first 2, since you made it that far, but be prepared for a major let down that will require major justificating to make peace with it.
B005NUFX68|4.0|This is a 'spoiler' episode and reminds me of the 'The Curse of Fenric' with Sylvester McCoy.  At the end someone has to let go, so the doctor can win.  Needs a new story line.
B0028YPDVW|5.0|I like this figure, it is well made and it will hold up well, as I've put it up high, so it won't break.  It is a neat little guy.  As someone who likes wolves, and I've contributed to their preservation, it reflects my feelings for them.  I don't want to get into collecting too many though, because it might become an obsession.<br />Nice price.
B001LM1456|5.0|Much better than the first two Hulk movies.  Why didn't they keep the guy who played the Hulk here for the Avenger Movie?
B0068THAGY|4.0|This film was much better than I expected.  The acting was superb, the effects were also.  But it really had that 50's horror feeling, where you know the monster was there, but you never saw it, at least until the end.  It's too bad more movies are not made this way anymore.  Now it's all about the special effects, and getting the monster in your face. This movie harkens back to a time when directors understood that weak special effects were not the reason you didn't show the monster right from the beginning.<br /><br />There was nothing weak about the effects in this movie.  It is well done all the way through.  You will enjoy it.
B005RK6EU8|5.0|If you've been watching the series then you pieced this together.  'Spoilers' ruin the fun.  Their all in on it.
0470638842|5.0|\\"Socialnomics\\" describes with passion how social media is impacting everything we do. Erik Qualman shows how companies have taken different approaches trying to make social media work for them. The author's statement \\"Fail forward, fail fast, fail better.\\" is his main advice for businesses integrating social media for their customers.   While it is not a \\"how to\\" book, it does provide resources for further study of the topic as well as thoughts about successful social media usage.   The book does exactly what the subtitle promises. It shows \\"how social media transforms the way we live and do business\\".
B004ZELSKI|4.0|I don't like these 'prequels'.  Therefore I rate them only because I'm required and I will keep getting emails to review it if I don't.  Watch the full episode and it's good.

B00318COS4|4.0|This game was unique and fun to play. Although the story line is somewhat short, most of your time will be spent trying to figure out what the heck you are supposed to do. This game challenges your mind through patience and puzzles. It can be easy to get frustrated at times. It is however a fun game and I always get a rewarding feeling when I finally figure out what to do.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Super 8 has received some criticism for being an homage to those kid-friendly adventure movies of the 80's (E.T. and Goonies), but that's why it's fun and charming! If you grew up watching those great films, then you may enjoy the nostalgia as you watch a group of boys hang out, cuss, fight and then compete for the same girl. If you didn't, you'll like the movie for it's interesting characters and plot. True, there are countless monster movies out there. But, there's something about this one that makes you wonder what that thing in the train really is! What's it doing? Believe it or not, the creature has some motivation that does not involve eating earthlings or burying some ungodly nest. And what's its connection to the shy boy Joe Lamb? Joe has been compared to Elliot from E.T., but Joe isn't interested in making friends (although he would like to send the thing home). All he wants is his dad's attention, and the girl. The creature presents an interesting opportunity to get both.   Super 8 is a refreshing movie in a time when every character from every other movie has cell phones or the Internet to help solve mysteries. These kids are faced with jumping into dark caves all by themselves without any help or any clue as to what they're dealing with. Buy it! It's worth it!
1419702238|4.0|This book isn't as good as the others but still pretty okay. Jeff Kinney did have some funny parts in the story. Greg is trying to be extra good for Santa this year. But that's of course kind of hard for him . He is just like he was in the books before. He's lazy and loves video games or screen related things. But this time he's done something really bad. He's ruined school property. Greg says he's innocent. To see what happens next read diary of a wimpy kid: cabin fever.
B003E6K1VK|3.0|The product works well to power higher-end headphones.  However, to me the higher freqs seem to lose clarity &/or the texture of the music is changed.  I have a Grado SR80i that play well from my laptop though the bass seems underpowered.  I got the E7 hoping for an improvement across the full freq range & more punch.  Connecting the E7 onto my laptop's USB gives me a bit more bass and the mids get \\"tamed\\" a bit, sounding a tad smaller or distant (SR80's are sometimes too bright anyway).  But, the highs seem to lose clarity (crispness).  I've switched back & forth (E7 or laptop)several times and have asked other audio afficionado friends who confirmed what I noticed.  I'll update my review when I try my fully burned-in Ultrasone HFI780.
0061914177|5.0|Crush It, by Gary V. is an awesome book!  Loaded with great info on social media and marketing ideas for your business and how to get started.  It was a quick read and easy to follow.  I have highlighted and earmarked lots of pages and know this will be a very useful tool as I start to add and implement each of the ideas for my business.  I highly recommend anyone who is passionate about their business or hobby and wants to CRUSH IT with social media to get and read this book!
B005N1E84K|5.0|Having attended 3 of Kylie Minogue's tours, I had an idea of what I could expect, especially since creative partner William Baker was to produce the show: High production staging, incredible costume changes, and great live vocals. As any uber fan, I followed the tour, via Youtube, on every single one of the 77 stops.   Given her latest work, Aphrodite, I knew that there had to be some sort of element of water involved. I was in awe of the way water was incorporated into the show; there were at least 3 pools of water in which dancers and aerialists were dipped by harnesses. Water jets were applied throughout the extended stage which would be queued to shoot during choreographed numbers. Prior to the tour launch, it was announced that The Fountain People, a company known for their water shows in several Disney resorts and the Bellagio fountain shows would be working on the tour.  The Greek theme was used throughout the show in costumes, staging, and props. Although the show was slow at times, the overall feel gave every Kylie fan their money's worth.   The show itself was directed wonderfully, as aired on Sky 3D overseas and in theatres. Also, in Kylie DVD tradition, a behind-the-scenes tour documentary entitled \\"Just Add Water\\" will be a special features addition.  Tracklist:   1.\\"The Birth of Aphrodite Intro\\"   2.\\"Aphrodite\\"   3.\\"The One\\"   4.\\"Wow\\"   5.\\"Illusion\\"   6.\\"I Believe in You\\"   7.\\"Cupid Boy\\"   8.\\"Spinning Around\\"   9.\\"Get Outta My Way\\"   10.\\"What Do I Have to Do\\"   11.\\"Everything Is Beautiful\\"   12.\\"Slow\\"   13.\\"Confide in Me\\"   14.\\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\"   15.\\"In My Arms\\"   16.\\"Looking for an Angel\\"   17.\\"Closer\\"   18.\\"There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)\\"   19.\\"Love at First Sight\\"/\\"Can't Beat the Feeling\\"   20.\\"If You Don't Love Me\\"   21.\\"Better the Devil You Know\\"   22.\\"Better Than Today\\"   23.\\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\"   24.\\"Million Dollar Mermaid Intro\\"   25.\\"On a Night Like This\\"   26.\\"All the Lovers\\"

B0064J6OMO|5.0|This was really awesome.  I would put it up there with the Hangover which means it is definitely a no kids in the room movie.  You really should rent this and expect the F word and honestly it would be best to see this with your lady as you both may be ready to go horizontal afterwards.
B0000028M7|5.0|AIC were one of the first grunge bands and Dirt is generally considered their best effort. It continues with their harder rock debut, Facelift but it's also more grunge with alternative influences. After their self-titled debut which was great but nowhere near Facelift or Dirt, they disbanded. Layne Staley died in 2002 but AIC are currently together with William DuVall. Their latest album was great but they'll never be the same without Layne and Dirt will remain a classic forever.
B001O8D47S|5.0|I loved this movie.  I loved the connection each of the women had with each other even though they were all different.  They connected so well.  Amazing story as well.  I will definitely watch again.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Machine Head made a couple mistakes in the past with The Burning Red and Supercharger but they've recovered. However I don't agree with it being their best album to date but it's the best they've done in a decade. After signs of hope on Through The Ashes Of Empires, they've seemed to make their first masterpiece in years and it's even a better album. The Blackening is arguably their croiwning achievement and the Master Of Puppets of the 21st century. It includes their hit single Aesthetics of Hate which shown more potential than on their previous album and it was nominated for The Best Metal Performance Of The Year. The Blackening is similar to The More Things Change with a slightly more modern sound to it. The album's solid throughout and essential for all Machine Head fans or anyone that likes hard rock or metal in general.
0446547603|1.0|Was good up until the middle to end.  Then the violence was so unlike Sparks.  I could   not believe it !!!  He has gone far away from the writer he once was.  I loved all   of his romantic novels but THIS  ?????  WORST crap I ever read.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|I went to 4 shows on the Speak Now Tour including the final show at Madison Square Garden and this is CD/DVD is the perfect reminder of just how much fun I had!

B0019HQIFE|5.0|A great sampling of Mayer's talents: acoustic, with the Trio (blues-y), and with the full band (his pop music). I can't say that he seems like a modest/nice guy, but you can't deny his talent!
1576875776|5.0|This has been quite a year for Vivian Maier. She has, sadly only after her death, been discovered for the incredible talent that she was. Her photographs are astounding. They are strong. They are prophetic. They are a mirror of the soul...they are a mirror of her soul. A truly beautiful edition of just some of her work. I cannot wait to see more.
B004HO6I2O|2.0|Piling on the reasons for making this an \\"R\\" rated film at the very beginning turned me, and my 18-year old son, off before we'd watch 10 minutes.  More f-bombs, sexual innuendo and drug use, as well as constant denigration of the main female character...we really didn't like it at all.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I grew up with STAR WARS.  I watched this series launch the beginning of the end of quality Hollywood.  \\"Instead of a story, let's just shake shiny keys in front of the baby!\\"  The first feature (A NEW HOPE) was the only good one, and the rest range from tolerable (EMPIRE, JEDI) to bile (all three prequels).  You want to lose yourself in genre story telling?  Great characters in compelling situations in space?  Surprisingly impressive effects within a far more impressive episodic story arc?  My sci-fried friends told me about such a series, and I didn't listen.  I could only conclude they were letting their genre preference get the best of them, but thanks to streaming Netflix, I've learned that the remake of --  -- BATTLESTAR GALACTICA renders any and all discussion of STAR WARS infantile.  I don't care if 12 year olds and under dig STAR WARS.  But if you're a grown adult who can't see what shiny steaming excrement STAR WARS is --  -- there's no new hope for you.
B005Q2XTLY|1.0|This album focused on her yelling more than anything else in the album. Don't waste your money on this album.
0385535139|4.0|A lot of AMAZON.COM reviewers tend to live in the past. One of the one star Reviews compared this book to \\"The Firm\\". Talk about comparing \\"Apples to Oranges\\". This book should stand on its own. Yes, it is slow moving. But in its slow growth \\"The Litigators\\" sets the stage for a wonderful conclusion. Another one star review states the characters are not believable. Well, they were believable to me. I assume \\"That\\" reviewer lives in a racist area where Rochelle could never be an Office Manager. Well, I have met \\"Rochelle\\" in many offices in the DC Area.<br />Book has a tremendous \\"FeelGood\\" ending which brought a hint of a tear to my eye. I think the average review of \\"The Litigators\\" as 4 *, is about right.
1419702238|5.0|Everything was packaged correctly, the book was in perfect condition and arrived quickly.  I was afraid of the length of the book as my soon is a very fast reader, but he just reads it over and over again.  Worth the buck in my opinion.
0446573019|3.0|IF I wanted to read a Reacher Novel, I'll buy a book by Lee Child. In fact Lee Child has written this book previously. Puller (Reacher) is in the Military comes to WV.

B005D0RDIE|5.0|AWESOME CONCERT VIDEO!!! I was lucky enough to see this concert twice on their tour, including this live in Cleveland! The TIME MACHINE tour is the BEST Rush concert ever!!! Moving Pictures in its entirety is awesome along with all the rest of the set list!! Seeing Villa Strangiata played live is worth crossing the planet for in itself!! Turn it up, sit back, air drum and ROCK OUT to the holy trinity!!
B004EPYZT4|2.0|OK, I gave it a 2, but it was a B or C movie at best, almost comical in its ineptitude. It screwed up so much of the back story it is amazing. I will not go into it all, but I was very disappointed.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|McAvoy is no Patrick Stewart, and Fassbender is no Ian McKellen. They are, however, more than adequate for their roles and carry the film with just the right balance of drama and melodrama.<br /><br />The movie lacks the vision and power of Singer's original, yet it still carries a punch of its own. If can you can put aside your expectations, you'll find that this is pretty good movie in its own right. Worth a watch!
1451648537|1.0|When I read this book I was very disappointed. It does not bring the reader closer to the person Steve. In the opposite, in  this book Steve appears to be without soul and emotions, very much like Dora. I think here is a follow up book from an other source/author needed. Very badly.
B003Y8YXH6|5.0|In reading other reviews, I find it hard to believe that some people try to make an actual comparison between the two \\"mixes\\".  The original 1980 release was strictly commercial.  Since John's passing, while I've never been a Yoko fan, to her credit, I think she's brought us more of the basic music John would have listened to himself.  This \\"Stripped Down\\" version is so far superior to the 1980 release version, there is NO comparison.  I was 25 when John was killed, had all his other albums, and this is this absolute best of all.  Sure, maybe the songs aren't his greatest, but they ring of a man who was truly happy at this particular time in his life and, I'm sure, he would have recorded even if no one but himself and Yoko were the only people to ever hear them.  Everyone, get over the comparisons, enjoy and appreciate something that John most assuredly would be happy was released.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Great Christmas album with a jazzy touch. Just bought it and don't want to stop listening. She is one of me and my wife's favorite actresses and we are now big fans of her music. This is a must have for any Christmas fan.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|In this post apocalyptic world two children from each area are sent to fight for their lives as 'tribute' in the hunger games. Katniss takes the place of her younger sister and enters the games. Here she must fight and kill in order to return home and have the luxury of seeing her family never go hungry again.<br /><br />The book is Death Race meets Logans Run with a touch of Survivor thrown in for good measure. It's a well thought out plot with and interesting characters who are believable and well drawn. Although morals and the consequences of the decisions you make are the essence of the book Collins handles this adroitly. Well worth a read, a good teen/young adult book, its great for both sexes and has a gripping story line. Read it before you see the movie.<br /><br />Meredith Brocklebank<br />Author of In the Realm of the Golden Queen
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! I love the characters, the storyline and how I'm still contemplating over the moral questions it raises. Can't wait to read the next one!
0316098329|5.0|\\"Enlightening\\" is the best term I can think of to describe this book. It is difficult to imagine what the world may look like to a child who has spent the first years of his life in captivity, with the only link to the outside world being a television. My absolute favorite part was reading the descriptions from the young child's point of view about such things as grass and the sky. The reader learns with him and fears what he fears. You'll laugh and cry and close the book with a new perspective on life. I don't frequently keep books once I've read them because I don't usually read books more than once. This one will stay on my bookshelf for years to come and I will keep going back to it.
B005SV9W4Q|4.0|Here is the thing. Before you judge what you think a remix CD should be like, remember this is Gaga. She likes to be different and not normal!   So with that being said, yes, this is definitely not everyones favorite remixes, or what one might expect out of a remix cd, especially coming from pop songs. However, that is not a bad thing. The Born This Way Remix CD is wonderful for what it is not. It is NOT another rebranded pop song, or just another club remix. It is NOT a collection of remixes that everyone will like. However what it IS, is a collection of dark, mysterious remixes that are the opposite of what she probably wanted in her actually Born This Way album. Every song recreates a new meaning to the song itself, and explores different instrumentation and connections. It is the \\"monster\\" that wasn't found on the Born This Way album.  As I said, not everyone will like it, and don't have to. There are some weird remixes on here, but overall I think it is unique and different, and dark. My top 3 favs are: Born This Way Zedd Remix, Scheisse Guena Remix, Judas Hurts Remix
B005HSG3VK|3.0|The case does what it is supposed to do - protect the kindle.  I like that it is lightweight/rubberized.  I do not however like that the edge where i generally place my hand is sharp.

0307593312|1.0|This book was 3 times as long as it needed to be.  The author rambles - and the repetitions become almost painful.  He goes off on tangents that aren't necessary to the story line (which is an interesting one) and they made me want to skip pages throughout the book (which I NEVER do).  A really unique story line and characters in a book littered with the same information over and over and over and over and over........  If that's your thing, go for it!  It wasn't mine.

B005XN0SGU|5.0|So I just checked on the Google marketplace and they offer a free version (no mention of ads), a $3 donation, and a $5 donation version.  It's not as if this is some unauthorized 3rd party port. I support the decision to release this version on Amazon's marketplace.  It could be worse, they could have required a $5 donation.  I expect to use this enough to justify a nominal token of appreciation.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|This is the best album I have purchased in 2011 hands down.Though it is a bit more R&B than rap , Drake has shown that his talent is limitless!
B005PTQPU0|1.0|It's a measure of Kate Bush's lack of self awareness that she should have chosen the sort of album title (yes, yes, the Eskimos - whoops, sorry \\"Inuits\\" - have 50 words for snow) those lampooning her may have chosen for her tendency towards tortuous pseudo-intellectualism, although the fact alternative luvvie Stephen Fry co-sings on the title track would leave anyone in little doubt about that anyway. Somehow it doesn't come as a surprise to learn she was the partial inspiration for the Harry Potter character Hermione Grainger, right down to the burst couch hairdo.  Solo artists and those whose \\"bands\\" are little more than backing bands are always in danger of the artiste disappearing up their own wotsit, but Kate Bush is of course the famous moral tale of where it gets you. Just a pity she never learned the lesson.  Kate Bush was a success purely and simply because her over the top stage & TV performances that would have relegated her to a cult artist with one novelty hit in \\"Wuthering Heights\\" instead were perfect for the New Wave/Punk zeitgeist of the late 1970s/early 1980s. Like Ian Dury, she was the right sort of British oddball at the right time.  After a series of hit albums and riding the wave of pop culture feminism that saw her as high-brow (though as her competing sisterhood at that point consisted of the likes of the Nolan Sisters, it was hardly an epic battle of wits) and adopted by the whole alternative counter culture of the late 1970s/early 1980s right down to doing the coveted Amnesty International \\"Secret Policeman's Ball Slot\\" (although Not The Nine O'Clock News did lampoon her intellectual self-delusions with the \\"Them Heavy People\\" parody \\"England My Leotard\\"), Kate discovered her paying public had little interest in being culturally 'educated' by her as \\"The Dreaming\\" and its singles were monumental flops.  Taking a leaf from CBS's book in dealing with The Clash, EMI told her bluntly they'd not release another record until they could be sure itwould be a hit: \\"Running Up That Hill\\", \\"Cloudbursting\\" and the album \\"Hounds Of Love\\" later, all seemed to be back on track - until \\"The Sensual World\\" proved she'd only done enough to keep her in contract before reverting back to unintented self-parody of her own ever-growing pretentiousness.  Meanwhile a certain Bjork waiting in the wings took on the mantle of music's eccentric genius, and Bush joined Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney in being one of those EMI hasbeens kept on more for the sake of back catalogue sales than any hope of any new material seizing the public's enthusiasm.  Not that she needs to worry much about alienating anyone: Bush's audience by then, as now, had been relegated to those ageing inverted snobs that turn their noses up at mainstream pop and classical music alike, sneering at the former's commercialism and - ironically - the latter's elitism. Show me today's Kate Bush fan, and I'll show you a Guardian reading weekend eco-warrior who never quite outgrew their undergraduate pretending-to-be-\\"into\\"-something-to-appear-cultured phase that boasts they have a black belt in Feng Shui.  So to \\"50 Words Of Snow\\", on the back of this year's flogging-a-dead-horse \\"remake\\" album (ever popular with aged musicians out of ideas wanting to use their remaining diehard but gullible fans as milch cows) that's already drawn predictable sycophantic praise from those that would hail as \\"genius\\" an album of Kate Bush farting through a kazoo.  Sure, if your familiarity with piano driven music doesn't go beyond Bruce Hornsby And The Range you might think \\"50 Words For Snow\\" as being the Cream Twinkie of music, anyone else will note that every song is as good as the last because largely every song is the same as the last, tedious in its studied ponderousness or copying everything Peter Gabriel has been doing badly over the last decade.  Likely to be sucking your will to live over the speakers of every Cappuchino bar within a 500 mile radius for the next few months. Even the \\"completists\\" are best advised to wait for it to appear in the bargain buckets before buying.

This action film stars: Robert Vaughn, Jaqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, Simon Oakland, Norman Fell, plus others. This film was released in '68 and is filmed in Widescreen formant in 114 minutes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Steve McQueen or likes action films or any fans of these stars.
B005WLQQ4Q|4.0|.....and was blown away by the beauty of their harmonies. Nice Thanksgiving gift.    I'm too old to appreciate the pop production of this album, but I sure do like their voices. I know it's stupidly unrealistic, but I wish they'd do an acoustic album, or a country album, or any type album which showcases their harmonic talent rather than a driving beat. But that's just me.
B0062LU85S|5.0|I enjoyed the unpretentious, almost haphazard collection of Twilight's soundtrack that somehow fit the almost accidental success of 1st movie of the series. I wasn't as fond of Eclipse's soundtrack nor New Moon's.<br /><br />As such, I wasn't really expecting much of the series's most challenging installment. But maybe lowered expectations affected me because I really enjoy this soundtrack.<br /><br />From the quietly joyful \\"Turning Page\\" to the throwback R&B of \\"It Will Rain\\" to the disquiet of \\"Cold\\", there is a wide range of sounds on this soundtrack. Although there are some songs that I am not quite as fond of, the ones that I am fond of make up for that.<br /><br />Usually I give a 5-star if after 3 weeks, I still like at least 3/4s of the songs and in this case, the Breaking Dawn Part 1 soundtrack passed muster.<br /><br />My faves are Turning Page, It Will Rain, Like A Drug (Bonus Track) and the 80s sounding From Now on. But I've got a lot of close runner ups.
B004LROUW2|1.0|As a Murakami fan, I have read nearly all of his books, romance as well as metaphysical novels, with great joy. So it was with a lot of anticipation that I started reading 1Q84, his much hyped latest novel. But this is by far the worst reading experience that I had of his books, if not of all books. 1Q84 was written with incredibly simple story plot, few notable characters to build the plot with and a gigantic (some 900+ pages) yet empty shell of unremarkable content. The story was basically told from the angles of a mere 3 characters (mostly altering between its two main characters, Tengo and Aomame), each intertwined with one another. The story telling is mostly monotonic and lacking excitement or the build-up of such for that matter. Many story lines were unnecessarily repetitive almost as if they were there to fill up the volume. In fact, if 1Q84 were a short story instead of the heaviest novel of Murakami's, it would have been more interesting and compelling. It was a boring and disappointing read in the mid of Book 2, but it turned into an agonizing experience towards a trivial but contrived end.
B005P89F0S|5.0|Excellent album, you will not be disappointed. I recommend the delux set because the extra $2 for the DVD is well worth it.
B00447G2T8|4.0|I am a huge fan of German metal and Helloween is the father of it all; not necessarily this version of the band but they carry on the torch.  Very catchy album.  \\"Are you metal\\" is little cheesy on the lyrics but sounds great nonetheless.  This CD has been in my car for a couple weeks now and I don't grow tired of it.
1451648537|5.0|This bio tells you the life of Steve Jobs from beginning to end. The details and everything he accomplished personally and professionally are well described on this book . A well written book. A great read.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I downloaded this months ago for my phone and never played it. Got my Kindle Fire recently and decided to give it a test run with this game. Well, needless to say... I can't put it down! 5 stars plus!!  I just hope Eve of the Genesis is an app of the day soon!
B005IZLPME|4.0|Very good, I was pleased with the product received within the estimated time without any problem. Como disse fiquei satisfeito com a compra e todo o processo pois a item chegou na minha casa antes do prazo e em boas condições alem disse o filme é muito legal.
068484267X|3.0|I can't really add more than the other more insightful reviewers have written. The subject matter is appealing, but there are many books like this one, I don't see why this one gained so much attention. McCourt's writing style is annoying and he seems to dwell more on sexual issues than necessary (especially his own masturbation).  The sequel to this book was even more disappointing. If you are interested in this type of book, I highly recommend Harry Bernstein's 'The Invissible Wall' which I read after this one (suggested by Amazon) and is excellent, as were the 2 following books, all written while the author was in his 90's.
1878424505|1.0|The very chapter where Ruiz talks about the importance of using one's words impeccably, he distorts a quote for the sake of his own polemical stance. &#34;The Word was God&#34; is translated as &#34;The Word is God,&#34; a huge difference, removed from its context. And there's more nonsense.  Like this:  speaking of the importance of speaking impeccably, Ruiz says that &#34;If all humans could communicate this way, with impeccability of the word, no wars, no misunderstandings, no violence.&#34;  Oh my God!  Does Ruiz really think that human nature is as simple as that?<br /><br />Let's go through the four agreements one by one.  First, be impeccable with your word.  Right.  Do that with a sociopath, or someone who is looking for a handle for control, and see where that gets you.  We all recognize what Mark Twain meant when he said that people must really value truth, because they use is so sparingly.  Go head, cast your pearls before swine.  Two, don't take anything personally.  Ah, I see:  my mind and body is an abstraction that I don't really live in.  What is humanity if not our subjectivity, our ability to connect?  Is there anything tha enters my experience that is not personal?  What idiocy.  Three (this is a doozy), don't make assumptions.  We evolved to make assumptions.  You can't drive to the grocery store without making assumptions.  You can't function in society without making assumptions.  This book is based on the assumption that you're a good natured but gullible cretin who doesn't think for himself.  Four, always do your best.  There are times a person can't, or shouldn't.  I will not do my best for a bad cause.  I will not do my best if it empowers rascals like Coelho, who is selling you his personal piety like so many priests and pretenders in vestments who went before him.<br /><br />Follow Ruiz's advice and become the village idiot.
B0002EXH5O|4.0|I don't have the remastered version, so I can't speak for it, but I own the original version which is very good.  I really like the sound on this disc, it's got a different feel for me than other Megadeth albums.  It's heavy, but not as heavy as their three previous albums, but it's faster and more complex, imo.  All of the songs on it are good, but my favorites are Holy Wars, Hangar 18, Rust in Peace and my very favorite, Five Magics.  As I've said, while this is their fourth album is sounds different from the first three and all others that follow it.  I really like this disc and sometimes throw it in when I'm in the mood for some Megadeth but with a bit of a different sound.
B005V20JKI|1.0|Orientation gets out of whack on my Kindle Fire.  Also has significant pauses every few seconds, making the game unplayable.
B0012GMXLU|4.0|Outstanding album.  I just recently got into Motorhead, but I really appreciate their hard driving, raw style.  My favorite tracks on the album are I'm So Bad (Baby I Don't Care), Love Me Forever, Nightmare/The Dreamtime, and the haunting and powerful title track, 1916.  It's a slower song, but the story it tells about the first hand experience of soldiers dying on the field of battle, and the way in which Lemmy sings it is amazing.  It's a song that actually has you feeling sad as you listen to it.  In fact, I can't even listen to it around my young son anymore because he thinks it's too sad.  Anyway, I would highly recommend this album to anyone who likes good, hard rock or heavy metal music.  Motorhead is among the best of the genre.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|the sounds on this app are not good for trying to sleep at all. just sounds like irritating noise. I'm definitely going to try and get a refund.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I bought this at their show in Dallas recently. I went on a whim when some extra cash came my way. First of all openers Testament w Skolnik back at the helm kicked serious arse! Looking fwd to checking out their new one, too. Anyhow, to be able to hear LIVE songs you've never heard before and latch on to the catchy riffs and hooks, with no expectation of how the show will go, well, that in itself is brilliant. This hasn't left my cd player since the show! They are back in true classic thrash Anthrax form cracking skulls! The album is sonically well produced without sounding too thin, muddy, or like the bassist isn't there, or is there but is playing an electric cigar box ukelele through an octaver. If you know thrash, you know these often are issues. Its great to hear some great songcasting to sing along to, hum the riffs without the current trend of vocalists that sounds like a cross between cookie monster, a garbage disposal full of glass, and my dad's colon.
0553801473|1.0|I read all of the previous books in this series and they are among the best fantasy that I have ever read. I'm sure that there is a plot somewhere in Dragons, but what's there could have been covered in a hundred pages. I made it three hundred pages into the book and it's on its way to Half-Priced Books. I don't have enough life left to waste it on the remaining pages.
B005KN5AES|5.0|Im blown away by these guys!! A strong comeback could be the best metal cd of the year!! These guys are so terribly underrated it sickens me. All anybody needs to do is listen to how good these guys are they have a tradition of making killer music this one stands up as some of their finest work!! Whats it going to take to make you Riot??? Love it:) Welcome back Tony Moore unreal Range!! The Guitar work of Flyntz and Reale is Top And I mean out of this world Top notch!! Buy it!!!
B005L38QK2|3.0|This mouse has a build quality similar to high end Logitech mice. There are two programmable buttons on both sides of the mouse.  The wheel has solid feel and is clickable - not as nice as the Logitech on the MX style mice. The mouse is kind of light but not too light.  The size and tactile feel of the rubberish shell is nice.  My hands are medium size for male and this mouse feels perfect.  There is a single button above the mouse wheel that kicks the mouse into turbo/gaming mode. The Quake logo and mouse wheel have a red LED light that gently throbs. The cord is braided and a bit stiff but feels heavy duty.  The mouse is symmetric so it will work the same for a right or left handed gamer.<br /><br />The box did not come with a CD so I went to the SteelSeries.com website to download the \\"Steel Series Engine\\" software.  Immediately the software performed a firmware update on the mouse.  A mouse with firmware?  Cool. The Steel series software is sexy.  Yes, I said sexy.  You can program buttons, adjust LED settings and create custom macros.  It tracks the total number of clicks for the mouse too.  Sweet.  Unfortunately the software could sure use some tooltips because it's not too intuitive.  I also did not see anywhere to download standard setups for popular games like Logitech software has. Too bad.<br /><br />Honestly,  before I installed the software and ran the firmware update I encountered a little flakyniess from the mouse where it seemed to go to sleep. I'll post here if I encounter that problem again.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Removing a star.  Mouse randomly shuts itself off.  Change the USB port and the mouse doesn't install the drivers properly.  Annoying.
B000002GZ1|5.0|The Paul Butterfield Blues Band (self titled):  After Elektra Label's \\"What's Shakin'\\" experimental album, they released The Paul Butterfield Blues Band's first album.  This not only turned out to be a great Blues recording but the album became the template for all the great Blues oriented Rock groups that were to occupy the last few years of the 1960's and remained so well into the 1970's.  This is a Great album.  It is hard to believe that the band could top this first album, but they did just that on their next release (East West).  This album (and its follow-up) is indispensible for any music collection.  Highly Recommended.
B002KAOSEW|2.0|I love Lee Child and his Reacher novels, however this one was surprisingly boring.  I skipped through several pages toward the end just to find out the basics of what happened.  The book starts out strong with a promising plot line, but seems to fizzle quickly.  Reacher cannot stay away from the town Despair, yet the leader of the town is fairly easy on him.  The supporting characters are also sort of ho-hum.    I am still a loyal Reacher fan!  I will continue reading Mr. Child's books.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great interface design. Great art. Just an awesome little game with fun kept as the center of attention. Nice job ZeptoLab.
B003U53QT4|5.0|During the decade of its production I never gave the show a second thought.   Those stark and bubble-gummy years were not for T.V. viewing, no no.  But, Ahoy Sir! Thats the way it would be eh? And she bows; Bravo...
B0028R765A|5.0|Watchmen takes the superhero genre to a new level where you are dropped into a universe filled with complex heroes and storylines and it does not water it down for a less mature audience. This is the exact type of movie we have always wanted and crave more of. American audiences are tired of being spoonfed when it comes to cinema. My only regret is that I have yet to read the graphic novel, but it is on my list for the very near future. Fantastic movie. Applause 1 million times over!
1401223176|2.0|If you didn't read it, it would be a great comic because the artwork is spectacular.  The color, detail and action in every frame are spot on.<br /><br />If you do unfortunately buy this book and are forced to read it to recoup your $20 than you are in for some hurt.  The story crawls along unnecessarily slowly.  Batman's crew and emotions abound.  Too much is put into Batman's feelings and not enough into him kicking @ss!  I really enjoy the pre-Team-Batman approach to Batman.  If you want a story about Batwing, Batgirl, and a handful of Robins past and present than maybe this story is for you...but it wasn't for me.  I thought the story sucked.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|It's been almost 25 years since The Smiths broke up, and we finally see a remastering of their official catalogue. Based on what's inside the box, it's been worth the wait. The music is fabulous....that goes without saying (but I said it anyway, lol). So let's have a look at why you should update/upgrade your current Smiths CDs.<br /><br />The remastering, overseen/undertaken/assisted by Johnny Marr, is a revelation. No fancy sonic tricks or unwanted/new elements were used.....the haze was simply lifted off of the music I thought I knew. A friend put it this way: \\"(the remasters) made me feel like I've been listening to the songs through a pillow all this time.\\" Exactly! Everything is cleaner (not just louder), and the bass and drums are much more present. When I first fired up Hatful of Hollow, it was like hearing it for the first time.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent as well. Mini replicas of the original vinyl releases, down to the smallest detail....that would be the incredibly small printed lyrics on the CD sleeves, lol. But you don't need to read the words, you know them like you know your own face. My copy sits on my shelf next to my Beatles Mono box set (The Other Fab Four).<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B003EEMIV8|1.0|My son is a fanatic for garbage trucks. I was so excited to order this truck for his birthday. This truck comes in two colors and both are reviewed separately. The red and green truck had a one star rating. The woman stated that the truck's packing panel broke within one day and the truck was rendered useless. I chose to ignore this review, assuming that it was a fluke, and ordered the orange version, which has a five star rating. Sadly, the truck arrived and the packing panel was broken instantly. As the packing panel is the main component of the truck, it cannot be used without it. My son was so excited, and now he is devastated to have to give up his brand new truck. The combined cost of a pack of garbage cans and the truck was almost $100, so I am not willing to accept broken material. This is a sad birthday...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best Keyboard on Market! I have tried  others and end up coming back to SwiftX. I would recommend other to give this one a try.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Wonderful movie & especially for those of us who lived through that time period.  Geoffrey Rush should have gotten an Oscar for his outstanding performance.
B006ANJ4BW|2.0|I believe you're more likely to enjoy this movie if you're young.  The action in this movie felt unbelievable, and lacked anything to really draw me into the story.  The special effects were exaggerated, which I enjoy, but nothing that impressive.  If you've seen the original this movie will probably be a let down.
0393064476|4.0|One point not noted in reviews so far? I find the New Historicism taught by Greenblatt to infuse this popular work as it has this professor's scholarly studies. As with Lucretius, about whom we still know practically nothing more than what Poggio did, so for Shakespeare, perhaps, about whom what we know has been debated for centuries?<br /><br />Matching the approach in Greenblatt's first work addressed beyond the seminar table, \\"Will in the World,\\" \\"The Swerve\\" works best when it elaborates the context as well as explicates the texts by the historically elusive author examined. To paraphrase, say, atoms and void-- nothing else (75) is a great way to sum up Lucretius' visionary, secularized impact, in the period (as Flaubert's quoted) between the time of gods and God, so to speak, when the pagans had a breather to judge their cosmos and civitas by their own estimations and measurements rather than those of Jove or Jesus. Now, this marked slant against religion rankles many fellow reviewers, as this anti-clerical tone enlivens the book, but consider how Greenblatt incorporates the barbed, righteous criticism of domestic secretary to the first John XXIII himself in this. Poggio's jokebook was popular in the Curia, but it was outnumbered by his moral treatises, castigating the corruption of his Church.<br /><br />Poggio's went on duty with his Roman master ca. 1415 to the Council of Constance, saw his pope deposed, and presumed to have witnessed Jerome of Prague burned alive after an eloquent Latin defense of his support of the similarly doomed Jan Hus. In New Historicist-popular fashion, Greenblatt figures these series of confrontations might have spurred the now-unemployed Poggio to have gone off to Fulda to find the Lucretian manuscript, as solace and to fuel his book mania. I find this convincing, even if as elsewhere in this work this scenario must remain speculative. The book tends to roam about, with necessarily \\"might have\\" and \\"could\\" as in \\"Will in the World.\\" Greenblatt skillfully makes his case, even if this rambles at times too widely, but it moves gracefully and at times very movingly. Any exposure of this Renaissance milieu and its classical foundation surely is welcome when few books aimed at a wider audience by professors address serious issues with verve and insight.<br /><br />Greenblatt with Poggio as with Shakespeare connects what we do know (and a lot of background detail, vivid examples, and tangential tales about flagellating monks, volcanically charred papyri, and bookworms) with what we cannot prove but can reasonably suppose. I liked this book, and adjusting its angle to account for the New Historicist perspective may help those readers who wonder why this professor constructs it as he does. May it also spark a renewed appreciation of Lucretius himself.fully makes his case, even if this rambles at times too widely, but it moves gracefully and at times very movingly.

031603441X|5.0|\\"Life\\" was engaging from beginning to end.  I listened to the audio version, and I was sad when it ended.  The biographical information was fascinating and a lot of fun to read, and any time Keith discussed music, I just wanted to hear more.  I would love to read more by Keith about music and, since he didn't say too much about it, more about his friendship with William Burroughs and interactions with the beat writers.  Definitely a 5 star book.

B004EPYZQ2|1.0|This movie had so much potential!  There really could have been a real story, some depth.  There is not climax to this film and there's really just a surface story.  [SPOILERS]  They mention when the alien touches you, you understand it.  Yet they don't elaborate on this point.  They're just like 'here it is, we're not going to do anything with it.'  It could have been a great movie. I was so disappointed.
0711225176|5.0|Please, according to the 'Product Details' this has 160 pages. Yet Gail Cooke, in a positive review,   says it has 222 colour illustrations. So, which is it? Appreciate your help.
0307272702|5.0|Gary Taubes has written a well-researched, important book. The information it contains will obviously start firestorms in some quarters, given that there are so many diet gurus, celebrity chefs, dieticians, physicians, psychologists, etc. who have staked their professional careers on what turns out to be unsupportable beliefs and bad science. For those, however, who want to get off the yo yo diet express once and for all, this book is a godsend.

B000H7JCIW|1.0|The voice and the video of the DVD Liza Minnelli: Live from Radio City Music Hall are out of phase... it's too bad
B004EPYZT4|4.0|I loved every part of this flick, but agree with an earlier review of the necessity of \\"epic-ness\\".  I would think that would include a little on the \\"teen years\\".  Kinda like you always wonder about Jesus' teen years.  Show me that, too, please.  All in all, great flick.  Momoa was perfect as Conan in the sense people are used to: blending the Frazetta idea and R E Howard's vision of the character.  Smarter than the Arnold Conan.  And your average bear.  Emotion, reaction......Awesome.  The leading lady was good as well.  They made her somewhat tough on her own, which is good.  Conan wouldn't want a damsel in distress in that way.  I hope they do a sequel, there is is a lot more can be done with Conan, and keep Momoa.   If you like Conan at all,you'll enjoy this film.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Simply put: this is a superb film.    Begin with a great story and excellent scenery.  Throw in outstanding performances by George Clooney and a very talented, and well selected, supporting cast, and you have a great, great film.    Clooney continues to gain just a huge amount of respect in my eyes and is becoming one of my favorite actors to watch on the big screen.  His knack for picking great stories to star in adds to this respect and his judgement as a true Hollywood professional.    That said, the real gem of this film is Shailene Woodley and how well she plays the smart, razor-sharp, yet classy Alexandra King.  Ms. Woodley is going to be a huge star in the coming years--no doubt about that.  And if her performance in The Descendants is any indicator of what is to come from her, she is an easy bet for an Oscar down the line.    The plot of the film is refreshingly clear and gripping and will pull the heart strings of even the toughest movie goer.  I highly recommend this film.  Five Stars (without even the slightest reservation).
B0034G4OY0|1.0|I reviewed this movie when it came out on dvd to review. If it weren't that I had to watch this to do my review I would have shut it off before the first 20 minutes. It was very boring and it felt way longer than it should have been.  Don't waste your money on this horrible movie
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a great product and is really useful and handy. great for people of all ages and works anytime anywhere
B000HEWEDK|5.0|So much has been written about this film, I'm sure I won't add anything you may not already have read.<br /><br />The intelligence with which this film was written is an argument that thinking people want to be challenged by what they are being offered. The medium is not the message, but the message can be conveyed by the medium.<br /><br />The power of ideas reigns supreme in good writing. The visual aspects of a film have to contribute, not overwhelm, to the overall story, the ideas, being presented for our consideration. This film balances both very well.<br /><br />And for a film made in 1956, viewing it today is every bit as powerful as the ideas conveyed in another classic, \\"Metropolis\\", from 1926. While there maybe elements that 'date' such films, the power of ideas clearly keeps these kinds of films relevant to today. Why? Because the ideas are timeless, the topics are the stuff of the human condition, which never changes, no matter the era in which they are portrayed.<br /><br />And when a film addresses these deeper kinds of things, when done with intelligence and with care for the way it is presented, absent \\"flavour of the moment\\" distractions, such films are destined to become classics that withstand the test of time - because the topics themselves are timeless.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book rates right up there at the top of my Stephen King list! I couldn't wait to see what happened next, but then when I got near the end I didn't want to finish it because I was afraid of how it would end! I loved the references to products and other things from the time period (brought back memories)and the plot was Stephen at his best! It is a fairly long book (also typical King) but I guarantee it's well worth the read if you are a King fan, and if you're not yet, you will be after reading this! Way to go, Stephen!

B005NFW1JK|1.0|I recently saw a review from another person complaining about the restrictions on instant video for this season. I  love this season but am having the same issues. I would love to be able to watch the episodes but cannot do so because I am stationed overseas. I too feel as if this unfair due to the fact that I am a US citizen and have a US address. This makes no sense to  me especially since Itunes allows the episodes to be downloaded. I can understand there would be issues if the product was free such as with Hulu etc but if I am willing to pay for them why not. Also now what am I supposed to do with my instant download credit? I can't do anything with it while overseas. I love this season but instant video on Amazon needs to have some adjustments made.

B0025KW29U|5.0|Dr Horrible could be classed as the ultimate superhero movie with it's ingenious collaboration of genres blended in just the right measure to make this both dramatic and entertaining. And who else but the master of creative writing and character development (Joss Whedon) to bring us this incredible show about the life and trials of a wannabe criminal \\"mastermind\\" neatly packaged with equal parts drama, comedy action, and Broadway. I've loved this show from the first time I watched it (back when it came in 3 parts) and this doesn't make me love it any less. The extra features make this a must buy for any Dr Horrible fan. Now.....if I could only afford those Dr Horrible My Little Pony collectibles......

1936719118|5.0|Definitely not a business book. It's a book that shares Derek's lessons, successes, and mistakes when he built an empire out of CD Baby.<br /><br />It's a short read, but it will go a long way. When you read Anything You Want, it gives you goosebumps because it's so inspiring to read. Derek teaches things that are very simple and easy to understand. It changes your perspective, and when you apply it in your life, it changes who you are.<br /><br />Definitely a one of the best reads out there.<br /><br />I've written some notes about it on my website: louiesioco[dot]com

All the books are no waste, they are exciting, action packed,a little romantic, (some kissing and relashionships) there are many surprises, but all are entwined into a marvelous book. If you love this book, then read them all, and trust me, you will enjoy them! :D

Later, we see the murderous workings of Stalin, the enemy of the people and witness the seed being planted that will grow to be Animal Farm and 1984.<br /><br />This book encourages us that a new world is possible and warns us, as so many others do, about how narrow and straight a path we must walk in revolutionary times.
B006AX6ONI|1.0|I am a huge fan of Mark, his blog, and the mavs. I bought this book as soon as it came out, thinking I would gain a few great insights but instead I found many pages that were simply a copy and paste of his blog. I would encourage mark, if he reads this, to consider only adding original content in future books. This was obviously churned out by his team of admins without the same effort he puts into his other initiatives.
0393072231|5.0|Really does deserve the hype. It does a great job of being easy enough to understand while also getting you \\"inside\\" enough to be bewilderingly infuriated and amazed.  For anyone who liked the \\"Inside Job\\" documentary, this book is the nuts and bolts of HOW it happened and how the system has not substantially changed to fix it.  Well written and more intriguing than you would believe possible for the subject matter.  5 stars
B004HW7JMO|2.0|The dvd set I received is a counterfeit! None of the disclaimers appear when the disc is played, the Starz and series logo appear on the screen during play and the tv announcer is heard during the credits! The box art doesn't even match the legitimate version! Where are the special features?! There are supposed to be special features but there aren't any! Someone copied these episodes straight from the tv and I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!
B004SC7B6M|5.0|Thank God I loved Pat in the 80s.  Otherwise I would have trashed this album big time.  This, clearly, is an attempt to go commercial, which is fine.  I don't think that this transition can be made on the shoulders of one keyboard guy doing pretty bad imitations of an orchestra.  I like it, but I think that the metal people following this band will barf badly.  Since this band is known as a metal band, to have sold out will probably kill it.  This album is OK, but it really is Pat Benetar in the 2010s.<br /><br />Update: 23 Mar 2012<br /><br />Well, I changed the rating to a full five stars.  Although it was not what I was initially expecting, this CD has grown on me.  There isn't much that seems like metal here, and the symphonic component is almost totally gone, however what is left is, indeed, one of the most impressive rock/pop albums that has been released in a long while.  Now, after having listened to it at least 25 times, I no longer feel that it is an attempt to \\"go commercial\\" but more a change in direction.  I would gladly purchase another Within Temptation CD that was done in this style.
B003JZT2AW|5.0|I'm relatively new to Britpop so I am a new Oasis fan which makes me sad considering what has happened. Therefore I immediately ordered this collection when I saw it. Bought it from importcd and delivery was pretty fast. Love every single song and the videos. But I do think \\"Champagen Supernova\\" should be included as one of the studio soundtrack. Overall I am super satisfied with this collection and it was a damn good deal!
0141301104|5.0|And you'll never guess where I found out about this book! OK. I confess. I was reading at an Internet \\"Hate\\" site where a blog commenter gave his theory about the real reason why Roald Dahl's book, \\"The Witches\\" is persecuted.<br /><br />He said the book has been banned and panned because although it's not a very good analogy of witches, it is a spot-on perfect analogy of the Jewish conspiracy against our civilization, including the alleged Jewish hatred of our children, as expedited by their attempts to have the little tykes all murdered pre-natally by the practice of ritual abortion, performed by \\"wise and learned Doctors\\" who are often clad in ceremonial robes and who sometimes also \\"just happen\\" to be Jewish, to boot. The alleged analogy with the so-called Jewish conspiracy to destroy our civilization also includes the alleged Jewish use of the COUNTERFEITING Machine, as found in the so-called \\"National\\" banks and phony fractional reserve banking scams that the Jews are said to be so wild about setting up in every nation under the \\"Son\\" (so to speak), and which the Jews have also set up in almost every nation under Mohammad and Buddha as well; and also the nations under that Hindoo elephant god-with-a-trunk, which you may have seen here and there!<br /><br />I could go on, but I'd rather leave it to you to do your own research about the alleged Jewish conspiracy against civilization -- which you can do simply by going to Google and typing in the search phrase \\"Jewish conspiracy.\\" And I'll level with ya: it really does seem to fit in some cases (and so does that cult-film, \\"They Live,\\" but that's another story -- literally :-)<br /><br />However, I do not think \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl is meant to be taken as an analogy of the alleged Jewish war on our civilization. Why not? Because there are too many inconsistencies, as you'll notice if you do the research I've recommended above.<br /><br />Rather than name and itemize those inconsistencies between \\"The Witches\\" by Roald Dahl and the (alleged) Jewish conspiracy against our civilization (and everybody else's civilization), I will close by informing you about the nature of the REAL conspiracy behind Roald Dahl's book, \\"The Witches.\\"<br /><br />In a word, \\"SHOES!\\" That's right!

B000XTLUW0|5.0|As a new Muse fan, I am super satisfied with the product. Every soundtrack was fantastic, especially my favorite \\"Unintended\\" and \\"Knights of Cydonia\\". Matt Bellamy is indeed a rock god, love his voice and the way he plays guitar. Same love for Dominic and Christopher. The intro was super cool and blended well with Knights of Cydonia. Wish I was one of the audience.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|Like several other reviewers, I thought that this case was flimsy and overpriced when I received it.  I had to wait until I actually received my Kindle Fire to try it out practically.  This case fits like a glove.  I find I'm able to use it in stand mode with no problems.  Perhaps others are handling the Fire more roughly than I do.  My Fire is safe, secure and ready to go whenever I take it out.  However, while the case does everything I need it to do, I can't warm up it.  The case alone hardly seems worth the price - even with the reduction.  Maybe time will make me glad I have it but if anyone asks me how I like the case, my answer will be \\"fine\\".
0440244412|5.0|Never in my lifetime have I read a series that left me so completely and utterly satisfied at its ending. Shadowfever is filled with death, loss, darkness, grief, and ultimately, the light that Ms. Moning has promised from the beginning. All the right questions were answered, my fears relieved, and my hopes sated, leaving only positive energy surrounding The MacKayla Lane Novels. My favorite part...\\"The End...\\" turn page \\"...for now.\\" Hmmm...what could that possibly mean?<br /><br />We find Miss Lane grieving over the death of Jericho Barrons. He died by her hand, causing her to devolve into a grief-stricken frame-of-mind. At this point she only wants to finish what she started and she will do it in any manner necessary, even if it means seducing the Lord Master, or Darroc as she now refers to him. This is the ultimate betrayal to those closest to her. I give her credit though, Mac set her mind to take control of the Sinsar Dubh and she doesn't back down. Too many peopl died at it's hands and Mac is taking over.<br /><br />The Fever Series is filled with deception and betrayal, making you question every motive of every person surrounding Mac. Shadowfever will leave you screaming \\"WTF\\" and \\"OMG\\" with every turn of the page. Very few of these creatures are what you have been led to believe. Those closest to Mac will surprise you the most. The world of Dublin has become a terrifying place, filled with unseelie fae and the humans are just going to have to make the best of it, because there is no going back.<br /><br />The secrets, oh the secrets, of Dublin have left my mind reeling with amazement. So many secrets guarded so closely, right under Mac's nose the entire time. The secrets about Barrons are probably the most notable. I want to tell you all of them...all of the secrets, every last one of them, but like Mac, you must find them out on your own. If you haven't read this series or have been teetering on the edge, wondering if you want to read them, you do. Trust me...you really do.
B004EPYZTE|2.0|Despite it's mammothly disappointing box office take and lukewarm reviews, I still looked forward to seeing this remake/reboot/re-whatever of Conan the Barbarian.  In all honesty, the film has a lot going for it, with some brilliant visual set pieces and set designs that wonderfully bring pulp writer Robert E. Howard's savage world to life, but other than that, the film itself feels oh so empty.  Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones) stars as Conan, the Cimmerian warrior seeking vengeance for the destruction of his people at the hands of warlord Khalar Zym (a scene-chewing Stephen Lang), and in turn embarks on a quest to save all of Hyboria as Zym's master plan begins to come to fruition.  Along for the ride are Rose McGowan as Zym's witchy daughter, and hottie Rachel Nichols as the pawn in Zym's plot; granted neither of them have all that much to work with.  In fact, nearly the entire cast of Conan the Barbarian do little to make things memorable, other than Stephen Lang.  The film's story is plenty predictable, and despite all the swordplay and blood and carnage on the screen, you never get that same sense of excitement or wonder from the proceedings like you did in the original 1982 Arnold Schwarzenegger film.  All in all, this new take on Conan the Barbarian isn't absolutely horrible, but it doesn't have the same heart and soul to it that the original film had.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Green Lantern's first voyage into the silver screen was highly expected. It didn't deliver to these expectations since it's financial performance was not what the producers had expected given the fact that the GL comic enjoys one of it's greatest times!  Personally speaking, i found the film quite enterntaining. It was filled with impressive space settings, the effects were good and Ryan Reynolds was enjoyable. I do spotted some flaws to the script and the mediocre performances of the rest of the cast (especially the one who portrayed the main villain)but if i remember other monstrocities such as Shumacher's Batman flicks and the Ghost Rider movie, then i would say that GL was a good movie by all means!  Of course the criterias are obsective but i would safely recommend to give GL a chance!
B005J4TLO8|1.0|How did this get made?  All I could think of was the unfortunate delivery person that in reality was murdered and that idiot screenwriters thought this was a good idea for a comedy.  Hollywood thinking at its most exploitive and revealing.  Crude, stupid, sexist and witless.  Sad.
B005FVFWOI|5.0|Way more clear that the original with a few added bits and pieces. Ian explains his view on God and religion on the last track. Simple but true. My friends also think this is the hottest thing since IHOP pancakes and suggest spending the dimes/Euros on it...

I wish you could have some choice in characters, like maybe have to pick eight guys or something, but regardless, cool game.... I'm hooked. runs great on my android tablet, sometimes it speeds up right off the bat and I'll have to pause it for a sec, but other than that it's good
0525423656|1.0|The same author? Really? I can't believe it!  The book is a much much bad compared to the 1st one. The characters become SO boring and fake. How come it takes 1 year to write such a \\"meaningless\\" book? No development in the story and in characters! Everything in the 2nd book should be \\"concentrated\\" in 1 chapter, and that is it!  There are a few series with a very good start, but very bad sequences. This book is definitely one of them!

0385737955|5.0|If you like \\"The hunger game\\", you will like this book, too. The main character was cleverly built. It is quite interesting to follow his characteristic's development.
0525423273|4.0|There is a lot of buzz about this book and it is well deserved.  I loved the main character Anna.  She is not perfect, but what 17-year-old is perfect with first loves?  The awkward interactions with her and her crush St Claire are so endearing.  The melodramatic BFF fights - oh, to be a teen again!  Perkins wrote beautifully about Paris.  I was never interested in going to Paris (thought it was overhyped).  But her descriptions of the Seine, the building architectures, and the food has put me on the bandwagon.  I want to go to Paris now.  The only reason for the one star off was because I felt the whole sexual tension between Anna and St Clarie dragged a bit at the end.  If you're going to get together, just do it already!!  Or was that just the novel bringing out my old teenage instant gratification??  Highly recommended.  I cannot wait to read Perkins next book.
0385534639|3.0|It would be 3.5 stars :)  The book should have been shorter in order to be more comprehensive. The characters should have been more connected.   Overall, a pretty good debut novel!

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|DO NOT buy Ultraviloet Digital if you have an Apple Mac Computer. It DOES NOT work with them and Amazon DOES NOT tell you this. I have bought two movies with the Ultraviolet version on them and just now discovered that they don't work on my computer. I have been screwing around with this crap for several days only to learn today that it will not work. The original description didn't even say it was Ultraviolet Digital before I bought this movie. I also bought Green Lantern and it had Ultraviolet on it too.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is a great movie but really weird & it needs to be watched more that once just to see what you misssed the first time around so if you saw it in the theater you should buy it so that you can watch it again. After a while you fall in love with the aliens? They are strong good people. Wonderful movie.
B005D9B26E|5.0|Ok People, we finally have a much deserved \\"Deluxe Release\\" of The Who's classic and amazing \\"Quadrophenia\\". I purposely waited a full week before attempting a review to give the CD a good listen 2-3 times and take in all the new demos and the amazing book. I've purchased Quadrophenia now four times on CD and was only 11 when it came out in 1973 so admittedly I do not have a strong connection to the sound of the original vinyl LP as I barely remember it.  I did have it for about 5 or 6 years and when CD's came out in the mid 80's, the mix on this was a bit muddy for my ears and I remember always adding a little treble. It seemed the '96 remastered CD was brighter but a little too bright. Based on a recommendation from a die-hard fellow fan I later purchased the Japanese remaster from and was pleased with the sound of that. This new remster is clearly very close to the regular '96 remaster but in doing a PC analysis did find the range was a little wider, so it clearly is not the exact mix.<br /><br />There's beem plenty of comment on the sound, but overall I do not find it bad and certainly not half as bad as some would have you believe and I can't believe someone would give this package one star. The demos are great to have. I was first nervous to hear there was some overdubbed drums on them, but it turns out that only applies to a few songs and after a few listens, I do not have a problem with them - effort was made to not make then sound too clear or modern. Pete's demos are always amzing and these are no different - it's definitely sometimes refreshing to hear Pete's vulnerable, subtle vocal take on a song rather than Roger's \\"locomotive\\" voice.<br /><br />The book in this package is simply amazing. I've bought loads of boxed sets over the years and I'm not sure there's ever been a better book included with a set - it's simply gorgeous; detailed and full of great photographs - many of which this long-time fan has never seen. I'm surpised others have not commentedjust how nice it is. Pete gives a very detailed essay about the project and there is a track by track section also.  I've added some photos of the book above in the product desciption.  A few of the photos do appear a little grainy, but again, this is minor and in fact they were a little grainy in the original release.<br /><br />Buying the set gives you access to some additional photos and info at on the Web.  Originally there was word that there might be some additional music there as well, but sadly this has changed.<br /><br />I have to give this 5 stars. I think the way to review this is by itself - I disagree giving it one star because you like some other mix better. The album is still amazing.<br /><br />I personally am not a big fan of sorround music and 5.1, so the lack of entire alum in this format was ok with me.<br /><br />Is it a little disppointing that the mix is not perfect? Yes, but we are talking about an almost 40 year old recording that has always has its problems. It seems that boxed sets always set you up for amazing hope and they can never live up to the hype and excitement. Even The Who's great \\"30 Years\\" boxed set has its share of problems - a couple of weird choices for songs and the unbelievably bad decision to \\"cross fade\\" tracks on disc 4.<br /><br />I say if you really like Quadrophenia and/or if you are a fan of Pete's demos, pick this up - the demos and book are alone worth it.

1439192812|2.0|If you are twelve years or older, do not waste your money on this book.  Dawkins enormous ego has never been more evident.  Although the description of the book states that it is for \\"...all ages,\\" in fact, the various chapters and awful illustrations  are more suitable for K through 4 children.  In Dawkins mind-set, science and scientific scrutiny answers all questions.  If you believe that, then go back 100 years and read about what scientists knew then--or thought they knew.  From an athiest's point of view, this is a good book.  For the questioning and skeptical reader, it's mostly bosh.

B001DD0HPG|4.0|In this age of so many cookie-cutter guitarists who never miss a note and sound indistinguishable from one another, it’s good to be reminded of what a revelation Julian Bream was. Here was a player every bit as individual as Andrés Segovia, but more disciplined and expressively sophisticated. Further, Bream was far more catholic in his taste, embracing both thorny modern fare and early music. Following Bream’s recording career as he explored his varied interests was a delightful adventure. (Perhaps no other musician of the time showed just how great the renaissance lute repertoire really is.) One wonders how many of today’s young guitarists, carefully groomed to never offend pedestrian tastes, will ever display similar artistic integrity.  This ten CD set is billed as a reissue of ten original LP recordings released between 1960 and 1983. As it turns out, the billing isn’t entirely true. One of the releases was a 1979 two LP set of live performances by Bream and Williams during their 1978 three city tour of the United States. In this new set, three performances that were on the original release are omitted: Faure’s Dolly Suite, Sor’s Fantasie, Op. 54, and the Brahms Theme and Variations, Op. 18. Why Sony chose to omit these is a mystery, as all three works easily could have been included on the CD—with these works missing, it times out to a paltry 37:30. What’s particularly galling is that the original LP jacket is reproduced for each CD sleeve. Thus, buyers of this new compilation can see for themselves that they’ve been cheated out of the complete 1979 release, as the three missing works are listed right on the original jacket artwork. What’s the thinking that goes into such an obvious insult to the buyer?  This is an unfortunate pattern that Sony has long followed with its reissues of Bream recordings, chopping up his original discography piecemeal. To younger buyers, it’s perhaps not a problem. But to those of us who grew up on and treasure these old Bream recordings, it’s infuriating.  One can quibble with the selections for these ten recordings. Bream’s playing began to slip during the late 1970s. So I tend to favor his earlier recordings. For my taste, I’d like to have seen these included:  Music for Voice and Guitar—Julian Bream & Peter Pears (1965) Lute Music From The Royal Courts Of Europe (1966) Julian Bream—Classic Guitar (1969) Julian Bream Plays Villa-Lobos, with André Previn and the London Symphony (1971)  And no Bream collection is complete without his astonishing Popular Classics for Spanish Guitar (1963), although Sony has mercifully reissued this uncut. But this Original Jacket Collection does include three of my favorites: The Art of Julian Bream (1960), The Woods So Wild (1972), and also Bream’s seminal 20th Century Guitar (1967).  To be sure, Bream’s recorded output was uneven. Sample the out-of-tune playing on his Romantic Guitar (1970) release. And his tone could be a bit grating, something that got worse as time went on. Further, RCA and Bream often favored a recorded sound that exacerbated rather than softened his faults. Oddly, it’s the earliest recording in this set, The Art of Julian Bream, that I find most flattering to Bream’s playing. But whatever his faults, Bream was always a compelling player.  Throughout this review, I speak of Bream in the past tense only because he has retired as a concert artist. Bream is still very much with us—indeed, he’s actively commissioning and sponsoring performances of new works for the guitar. Even in retirement, Bream is a force for expanding the guitar repertoire.  So deduct one star for Sony’s callous omission. And here’s a bit of advice to Sony: the next time you reissue an original recording, include the entire recording, not bits of it.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Update: Sony re-released the complete Bream RCA recordings as a box set in 2013. The missing worksnoted above are included in the complete set.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|the plastic edges are sharp and make it very uncomfortable to hold the Kindle at the bottom. It's also rather cheap looking and feeling. I doubt I'll use it for long.
B001FB5634|1.0|Yes, Yes, Yes. The Road is well acted, cinematically lush even in its sparceness, and emotionally engaging. For me, the most important question after seeing it was, \\"How can such a riveting film be so blind to so much?\\" The only answer I can come up with is that the book's author was blind, the screen writer was blind, the director and actors were blind, and everyone raving about the film is blind to its many serious flaws in content and imagination.  I preface the following thoughts by saying that, as a teenager, I lived through an event of some days and, to a lesser extent, some weeks similar to the devastation that provides the backdrop and apparent rationale for how everyone behaved in this film. And, people did not treat themselves and one another ANYTHING like they did in this film. Granted, my ordeal did not grind on for months and years until starvation and fatigue stripped all humanity from the minds and hearts of those who saw too much and remained alive too long. But the 1964 \\"Good Friday\\" earthquake that isolated communities all across Alaska, sometimes for weeks, did plunge many into a relatively deep and abiding state of privation.  So, let's first wonder what the overall point of a book and film might be that sets itself so far down a bleak chain of events that human beings are over the edge of extintion? Does anybody doubt that prolonged, extreme privation can strip us of every virtue, and reduce us to udder terror, dispair, and the inhuman treatment of others? Do we benefit in any way in our daily lives by being given such things to watch, by watch them, by feel ourselves entertained, and by praising those who made them?  If we try to decode and tease out the meaning of this film, what do we find? Do we find that demoralization in adversity is stronger than a mother's love and protective instincts for her child and husband? Do we find that a father will harm and kill others out of vindictiveness and unreasonable fear for the life of his own son? Dowe find that men will band together for the sake of torturing, killing, and eating others? And this we find hypnotically entertaining?  My observation is that we are more and better than these things. In dire circumstances, I have seen a mother give her life trying to protect her children from the cold, but I have never seen one give up and commit suicide. I have seen a man harm another to protect his family but only when all hope of escape was gone. I have seen men rise to a dire occasion, arm themselves to the teeth, and become the law in the jungle, but I have never seen them do anything but help the weak and the injured.  We are a species different from others. Yes, we are addicted to the objects of our senses, but we have empathy, compassion, and creative intelligence enough to act above our addictions. When things are at their worst, we ARE at our best. I submit that the author of the book, the screenwriter, the director, and the actors in the movie have NEVER been in the situation they have created for our entertainment. I submit that, by virtue of this fact, they have no basis other than idle and ignorant conjecture for showing us a fictional depiction of their own fear and ignorance. I submit that there is no socially redeeming quality or element to this film. It teaches us nothing positive and it only sews unreasonable fear and demoralization.   When are we going to turn our backs on such things, and use the time to do what we can to bring more Good into the world?
B005PTQPU0|5.0|This album is the personification of snow. It's as if the music were struggling through the cold, dense air. At times, flurries; at other times, an irritated blizzard of sound. Vocally sublime. The lyrics are outstanding and inventive, as always with Ms. Bush.<br /><br />What I appreciate most about this record is its uncompromising structure - so refreshing. I love that this album does not function in a predictable way. Gone are the constraints of verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus, \\"50 Words for Snow\\" is far too evolved for the constraints of inconsequential pop formula. This album functions outside of immediate gratification, to which modern ears are unfortunately programmed. Give in, go with it, and you are in for a glorious, wintry, and musical odyssey - this album has much to offer!<br /><br />For those waiting for \\"Hounds of Love\\" Part II, please move on and stop writing acerbic reviews. If one is looking for formulaic pop music, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if one is searching for a challenging, hypnotic suite of crystalline music dissolving at its own chosen speed, you will be enraptured!<br /><br />Mark my words, scholars of music will be studying the work of Kate Bush (especially her work in the last 6-7 years) long after the contemporary musical fads have been digested and discarded.
1400069181|4.0|Success is not defined by status and money.  For Blake Mycoskie, the founder of Tom's Shoes, success is defined by making a difference in the world.  Although his company is for-profit, he practices philanthropy by giving away a pair of shoes to a child in need for every pair sold.    One reason Tom's Shoes does so well is because they tell a story that reaches people at an emotional level.  Although we frequently forget facts, we tend to remember stories.  You don't need to follow in his `shoes' and form a brand new company to find your story.  Starting something that matters doesn't necessarily mean quitting your day job and jumping into a whole new venture.  Simply look around your community for a place to start.    To get started and find  inspiration, read success stories of other people who are working in your field of interest or are simply doing great work .  Anything you do to can help even one person is important.  Change your mindset and simply start by watching out for ways to give.  You can probably do more than you think.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Love this app. Don't review many FAOTD's, but this one was entertaining enough. Works perfectly fine on my Tmobile G2X, no force closes or uninstalls. If your device can run it, I highly recommend it!
B005V20JKI|4.0|I like to putz around on games like this from time to time, and it works pretty well on the Kindle Fire. Controls can be a bit annoying at times, but the game is simple fun, so I just brush it off and just play on.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, but I ended up playing this for about an hour straight. There's always something to unlock with just a few more minutes of playtime. Great graphics, solid controls and fun quick gameplay. It runs very well on Kindle Fire.
042524489X|5.0|Amazing....everything you were hoping for and MORE...seldom does a book live up to the expectations but Kiss of Snow is just amazing.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Okay, I have been using the Amazon app store since the beginning. I've noticed a trend of people with LG Optimus and other outdated phones rating every FAOTD poorly. Something needs to be said. I understand that your phone isn't that old, but it was outdated the moment it came out, and you shouldn't take it out on these developers because of this fact. I agree there should be some guidelines in place as far as the specifications required to play these games. However, this doesn't give you the right to download games you know your phone can't handle running. Please accept the fact that your phone is outdated and don't degrade quality games because you went for a cheap Android handset. This game is hugely entertaining, has great graphics and very fun gameplay. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone with a phone capable of running it.
0982633939|3.0|Not a bad read.  It has the weakness most crime thrillers suffer of the characters being two dimensional - no depth.  He does generate a real familiarity with the location and the chase scene over the roof is detailed, plausible and exciting.  Of course the real interest is the comparison with the film.  The film is better by a fair margin.  Much wittier and more glamorous.  Cleaver lines \\"do you prefer the leg or the breast\\", \\"tell me what do you hope to get out of being so nice to me\\" and \\"o'mother will love it up here\\" have been added by the Hitchcock team.  But they had hindsight and Carey Grant, David Dodge only had  his wife for support.  Dodge says after a cat burglary in the mansion next door, the story just wrote itself: \\"the quickest 80,000 words I have ever written\\".  Though it later made him a millionaire thanks to the movie at the time of  writing it was just a pot boiler to make quick money.
0375703764|5.0|Book was recommended by a friend of mine.  She described it as \\"weird\\" and I couldn't resist.

B005U9RQNU|5.0|The last two episodes were full of buffering problems which made them drag on and added to the suspense (intentional?!).

B0065IZEE8|5.0|The affection afforded this British movie by other UK reviewers is absolutely on the money - \\"Third Star\\" is a superbly realised little film with a huge beating heart. I was very moved...<br /><br />The story goes like this - James' lifelong but hapless pals decide that one last adventure will be a hoot and morale booster for their mate who is dying from an incurable disease. So they drag his three-wheeler chair loaded up with tents, drug suplies and a potted tree they will plant at journey's end - across fields, forest and coastal terrain. Their destination is Barafundle Bay - a stunning, secluded inlet in Wales that James adores. And you can see it in James' face too. He thinks that if he can just get there 'intact' - everything will be all right somehow. But of course nothing goes to plan and despite the odd belly-laugh along the way, the journey tests their friendship and loyalties to the absolute limit...<br /><br />First up - praise has to go to HATTIE DALTON for her warmth and steady Direction in what could have been awfully cheesy material that's been done to bits too many times before. She's given this buddy-buddy story a lightness of touch that feels real and isn't forced. In fact, the constant wit and pranks reflect just how guys are when they're in real emotional turmoil - downright childish even. Kudos should also go to the four male leads who had to gel together convincingly, muck in on the arduous trek and physically brave the coastal weather - none of which can have been easy - or in the case of the freezing Irish sea - deeply unpleasant. And when the reality of their friend's terminal illness slowly begins to kick in and intrude on their 'fun' - they're skills as good actors make you 'feel' the heaviness of what their characters are all trying to block out.<br /><br />Principal lead Benedict Cumberbatch has many fans - and on the strength of his acting chops both here and on \\"Sherlock\\" (the UK TV series) - it's easy to see why. His James is a demanding lead-role - a frustrated 29-year old who is being eaten-alive by cancer. His longing to live - to have more time - to realise at least some of his dreams - are always at the surface - and you ache for him as he slips in and out of a morphine-induced stupor that is numbing his escalating physical agony. As well as the pain - James has to also contend with his squabbling, tetchy pals - who are trying to be cool about it all but are freaked out inside and increasingly awkward with his now impending loss.<br /><br />His fellow travellers consist of Adam Robertson as the witty and yet dependable Bill, Tom Burke as the needy but sincere Davy and JJ Feild as the handsome devil-may-care Miles (surely a new Jude Law in the making). They will even encounter Hugh Bonneville (of Downton Abbey fame) as a nutty Beachcomber looking for rare Star Wars toys. The dialogue is playful, smart and confrontational when it's needed. And then they're faced with the ultimate true-friendship decision - but can any or all of them - actually go through with it? Even with this much sadness at its core and end, \\"Third Star\\" remains hopeful - a sign of a great film rather than just a good one.<br /><br />EXTRAS include a brief 'Making Of' and two shorts by Hattie Dalton called \\"The Banker\\" and \\"One Of Those Days\\". The only real let down for me is that it's on DVD only - and not BLU RAY - where all that great camera work would surely shine even more.<br /><br />There are moments in \\"Third Star\\" when you genuinely ache for James' loss - when you hurt at the arbitrary cruelty of life - snubbing out one person, but letting another live.  This is a very good movie - one that celebrates life and makes you think about it too.<br /><br />Put it high on your rental/to buy list...29-year old who is being eaten-alive by cancer.

B005TZFZJC|3.0|This young lady is very talented and is certainly working hard - but this release is a bit vacant.  Lead single WE FOUND LOVE is a great dance anthem and will end up being a classic;  You Da One, which was released as the first single is #1 is essentially chart saturation.  Perhaps her management or Jay-Z want to give this young woman a berserk run at #1's that beats all the other female singers but she is teetering on burn out.  RATER R was very underrated and she rush released LOUD which was a perfect, perfect pop album.  I believe career wise, Rihanna should have release WE FOUND LOVE and gone on a nice vacation.  Her management is pushing her and if she doesn't watch it she will go off a cliff.  The super porno lyrics are ceratinly fed to her by her handlers - I have a hard time thinking this young lady would extoll so much XXX in a full on format, as opposed to a subtle one.  Makes you think she does not have too much inside her head: a robot.  She is young, beautiful and talented,  so she still has time to claim some serious cred.  I think she needs to find new management.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|I was hesitant to buy gladiator on blu-ray because of the ongoing probability that you can get the old, unremastered version.

B002KH4KSY|1.0|Oh my God of the Corn.  This was so BAD!  I saw the original back when I was a kid, so I wanted to see what they did with the story with the modern remake.  I thought it was bad from the start.<br /><br />I usually want to like the protagonists of the movies/books that I see/read.  I didn't like the two main characters from the beginning.  From her bitching and moaning, to his hitting her and ignoring her wishes, I really didn't care what happened to them.<br /><br />I laughed out loud during the main chase... One of the kids actually had a leaf rake as his weapon.  The 4 year old getting all worked up at the \\"fertilization scene\\" was a bit strange, then the Vietnam flashbacks, and the Wizard of Oz-like attacking vines did it in.<br /><br />Free on Netflix, or in the used bin for $4 bucks as I got it, it's still not worth it.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|This movie, according to rotten tomatoes and other critics, is supposed to be lousy. In my opinion, this is far from it. It shows the sides of living the opposite lives; living a life of a busy/working man and the life of a down-to-earth/relaxing life. I personally found the movie to be eye-opening. Life's meaning is not to always work but it is also not to always have fun; just need to find the right balance. Great movie with funny moments and also serious and thought-provoking moments. The only negative thing is that they revealed too many of the funny moments in the trailer and left the audience with many predictable scenes. Nevertheless, I will buy the dvd in order to have a physical copy since it is a great movie.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Piccoult is a talented writing often tackling difficult topics and subjects.  She does a great job making a twist at the end of each of her stories.  Nineteen Minutes is one of my favorite of her novels, and was very well written.  It tackles the issues involving a school shooting.  This story will keep you wanting more.  You will not want to put the book down.  The story far exceeded my expectations and would recommend this book to anyone I know.  One drawback would be the use of language in her books.
B000002BBY|4.0|After the 1st album (Definitely Maybe) it was going to be hard to match that epic. The lads do a good job of trying as so many tracks on this album do hit the mark. \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" is a standout but it's not the only one. \\"Hello,\\" \\"Wonderwall,\\" \\"Some Might Say,\\" \\"she's Electric\\" and \\"Morning Glory\\" all stack up well.<br /><br />The weakest track is the single \\"Roll With It\\" which sounds at best like a B-side. Also, \\"Champagne Supernova\\" is far too long. Clocking in at 7 mins 27 secs, I had time to go make tea and have some crumpet (hey, I work fast...what can I tell ya).<br /><br />All bad puns aside, the overall feel of this album is less a sonic explosion and more a fun night out at the pub or on holiday. It doesn't make it less enticing, just different.

0307593312|4.0|Part romance, part thriller, 1Q84 explores what can happen to people who live in a world without love.  In the spring of 1984, Aomame,  a health club trainer , jumps out of a cab stalled in traffic on an elevated expressway and descends a ladder into a strange world she labels 1Q84, a place where day to day reality has gone off kilter.  We quickly learn that Aomame has a grisly sideline: she uses her skills as a physiotherapist to dispatch men who brutalize women.  Raised by religious fanatics, Aomame left home early and has grown into a tough, competent, emotionally contained adult.  The high point of her romantic life happened at age ten, when she reached out to grasp the hand of Tengo, a boy in her class.  She hasn't seen him since.<br /><br />Tengo had a rough childhood himself as the only son of an emotionally distant fee collector for NHK Television.  Now in his late twenties, Tengo teaches math at a cram school and is attempting to make it as a fiction writer.  An editor friend convinces Tengo to rewrite a fantasy novel by a female teenager who has submitted her story about little people who emerge from the mouth of a dead goat and make chrysalises out of air.  From these chrysalises hatch replicas of real people.  The girl author, Fuka-Eri, has run away from Sakigake, a religious cult led by her father.  Once the book is published, Tengo gradually discovers is that Fuka-Eri's fantastic story may in fact be true.  The novel's point of view alternates between Aomame and Tengo as they make halting progress toward reconnecting.  Tengo and Aomame's path back is blocked by the Sakigake cult, which feels threatened by Fuka-Eri's and Tengo's novelistic collaboration.<br /><br />Although the book is about 100 pages too long, (especially the sections dealing with a detective hired by the cult to track down Aomame), it's compulsively readable.  Many of Murakami's signature preoccupations are here.  The characters glide between a quotidian world of cooking, cleaning, going to the bar and a dreamlike world of two moons, immaculate conceptions, mind reading cult leaders and little troll people. Many of his books have Japanese teenage girls as characters.  The one here, Fuka-Eri, is part sprite, part nymphet, a character who fits perfectly into the alternate reality of 1Q84.  Murakami doesn't shy away from her sexual power, indeed sex in many variations saturates this novel, sex for the most part divorced from love.  Murakami has explored the world of cults before in Underground, his superb non-fiction examination of the Aum Shinrikyo cult that released poison sarin gas on the Tokyo subways.  The Sakigake cult in 1Q84 has its own closed circuit logic that threatens the safety and happiness of the book's main characters.<br /><br />Murkami's consistent message is that the reality created by human minds is an unstable construct.  The best parts of 1Q84 depict the struggles of people with blunted emotions trying to make their way back to the \\"real\\" world.  Although Murakami leaves several plot threads dangling, this is a powerful, richly imagined and emotionally satisfying look at how men and women who can't connect with others wind up existing in a pale approximation of reality.nd a dreamlike world of two moons, immaculate conceptions, mind reading cult leaders and little troll people.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|Remember when movie makers used to spend most of their budget on writing and telling a good story, instead of spending all the money on special effects and the remainder on the script?  Super 8 is such a movie.  The plot revolves around a group of kids, a few of whom are dealing with losses in their life.  I don't want to spoil the story so I will stick to what was shown in the trailers.  A late night train crashes.  Precious and unusual cargo was inside the train.  The movie revolves around the mystery of what was in the train and what is the cause for strange happenings in the town.  The kids in this movie are all great actors.  The story is great and full of suspense.  The setting of 1979 is actually very cool (which I did not expect it to be.)  The movie is pg-13 but I was surprised at the language.  It wasn't too brutal, but clearly the language police were lenient with the language in this movie.  Despite the language, the movie is a great one to watch with your family.  I had on the subtitles so maybe I was more aware of the language than I otherwise would have been.  With all the garbage, throw away movies made this year, Super 8 was a nice suprise.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I've had the PX21's for about 10 months now overall I actually like them. There comfortable to wear for long gaming sessions even with my glasses on. They work well on PS3,XBOX,and PC. I primarily use them on the PC. I do however have issues with the durability of the PX21's after about 3 months the wire connection points on the volume dongle failed. Thankfully I ordered on Amazon so I could provide proof of purchase to Turtle Beach for the rma. Now 7 months later after simply removing the headset from my head the right side ear cup swivel hinge broke cant really glue or tape it cause it needs to swivel in order to fit properly. The warranty is good for a year so I got a few months left. Yet to see if Turtle Beach will replace yet another pair if so I may actually add a star. I am considering other brands for my next headset Steelseries and Logitech to name a few keeping in mind of course that none are perfect except for the Sennheiser HD 800 can't drop $1400.00 on a headset though. Update 9-13-12 PX21's broke again about a month ago audio cut out wiring issue I guess. None the less I gotta give props to turtle beach they did replace them 3 times during the warranty period, and I will run my X12's to the grave, for my PC headset though I'm gonna give Steel Series a try with there Siberia V2's. I also tryed the Plantronics gamecom 780's they we're good but had a fatal flaw on 2 different pair audio pop on pitch changes finding a good headset is hard they're all flawed in some way.
1451627289|5.0|I'm what you'd call one of the \\"prodigal\\" Stephen King fans: I loved his work, then for a while I didn't, then within the last eight years or so he's turned me around again. There are other types of fans, but I find that my style of fandom is the second most common, the first being people who used to like him, then stopped, then didn't pick him up again, so really they're \\"former fans\\". His most recent collection is one of those books that if you're a former fan it will make you an prodigal fan.<br /><br />The premise is dirt-simple: a school teacher is shown a portal that takes a person back in time to one day in 1958 and, after some experimentation and some cajoling by the portal's owner, he is convinced to go back in time to try and stop the assassination of JFK. It's not horror. It's technically a science fiction novel with large swathes of dramatic story...LARGE swathes.<br /><br />If you think horror is King's crutch, you will be pleasantly surprised. All of the tools that King has made his bread and butter with - resilient first person narrative, everyday folks thrust in spectacular situations, curve balls - are in full display here, but without the overwhelming supernatural element. The horrors here come from regular folks, from man's struggle against himself.<br /><br />It's a captivating read, paced well (though some of the third part is a little long in tooth, but by then you're in it for the long haul) and he resolves it splendidly, circumventing his long-held Achilles' heel of weak and abrupt endings. He must have been taking finishing classes from Frank Darabont, who has been cleaning up the endings in his films since \\"Shawshank\\".<br /><br />If you're a fan, you'll dig it. If you're a former fan, you'll dig it. If you've never read King before because you don't like horror, this is a great place to absolve yourself of the misguided notion that horror is all he writes, or writes well. A great book in the JFK fiction canon, and a pearl of a story in King's own track record.

0061969656|3.0|I confess to the fact that I am a huge Bernard Cornwell fan.  I've read, and own, the entire Sharpe series, which I believe is his best work.  I have been a fan of his Saxon chronicles as well, which are interesting and entertaining, giving us a view into the formation of England as a country.<br /><br />His stories, which follow the life of King Alfred and the battles between the Saxons and the Danes, are well told and loosely based on historical events.  Unlike his Sharpe stories, however, the Saxon chronicles are starting to feel a bit formulaic and stale.  If you've read one Uhtred story, it feels like you've read them all.  Inevitably some Mercian or Saxon switches allegiances, allies with the Danes and declares war.  Uhtred is retrieved from retirement, leads the Saxons to a hair-raising but ultimately successful final victory.  The stories are well-told and keep the reader engaged, but are starting to feel very similar and are following a theme or formula. After reading this I am interested to know how Edward and Aethelstan finally conquer the Danes and unite England, but I guess I'll have to wait another novel or two to find that out.  Hopefully the next one will divert from the formula to spice up the story line.

006091307X|1.0|I finally read this because I've never yet managed to complete a Thomas Pynchon story. I managed to finish this novel only because it's short. I'm left confused about many things, but not about this: I enjoy interesting and different books, but books loaded with pretentious intellectualism bore me to death.<br /><br />There's story-telling (which entertains and moves its readers) and there's word play. `The Crying of Lot 49' clearly falls in the last category and, while it might provide many readers with a satisfying read, I find the weirdness too weird, the \\"cleverness\\" too clever for its own good and the deliberate manipulation of names, references and language constructs silly. Is Pynchon actually laughing at us, the readers, who swoon at his \\"brilliance\\"? Either that or, like Sacha Baron Cohen of the dreadful movie \\"Borat\\" fame, Pynchon is a sad man with a rather warped and gloomy view of the world.<br /><br />As a reader, I want more to a novel than pretentious intellectualism posing as literature. I enjoy reading a wide variety of genres and styles, fiction and non-fiction. I don't care what I read - as long as it's good writing and keeps me engaged.<br /><br />Despite the occasional glimpse of what could attract people to this story (for example, Mucho & Oedipa's obsessions apparently suggesting ordinary folks' obsessive need to believe in some kind of reality and order - I say \\"apparently,\\" because I'm not entirely sure I \\"got it\\"), Pynchon's writing required too much effort to make any sort of sense to me.<br /><br />Perhaps that was the point of the difficult, delirious writing style: that, despite modern technology supposedly assisting mankind in communicating, Mucho & Oedipa (representing the average human) were still unable to communicate with each other.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|I can't believe I had never read this book before, and I'm very glad that I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I hate to admit this but a lot of older classics seem wordy, slow-paced, and overly introspective to me these days, but the stories here are exciting and short enough that you can read each one in a single sitting, making it great light reading...or, there were a couple of times when I had to read several at once!<br /><br />A lot of the free public domain ebooks out there are very poorly formatted, but this one is pretty well done.  No complaints for the price!  As others have noticed, you can't skip ahead to the next chapter easily, but as I was reading in order it wasn't a problem for me.  Also, the pound symbol for currency (which I can't type on this keyboard either) came across as a string of gibberish.  I was able to figure out what it was supposed to be, and at least it was the same string of gibberish every time, so it didn't stop me from understanding what was being said.  All in all, compared to some of the free ebooks out there with broken-up paragraphs and chapters running into each other, I consider this well-formatted for the price!
0571283578|3.0|I have read many sequels to Jane Austen novels - most of them dreadful - and was very much looking forward to this one because it is by an author I respect and enjoy. I do however suspect that she had more fun writing this book than I did reading it. While it was neatly and professionally done, as you might expect from an author of this calibre, it lacked much of the charm, humour and lightness of touch of the original. Indeed, in stating categorically that Elizabeth Bennett was not imaginative, I was left wondering if the author had read the same original novel that I had.  The language occasionally grated. Jane Austen's language was immensely complicated at times but all to good purpose and never unnecessarily so. Too many writers of fan fiction seem to feel they must emulate the complexity simply for the sake of it and that was a little the case here at times. Also, freely using contractions such as 'I'm and it's' for the dialogue so constantly, grated on me. It was too modern and an editor should have been onto that very sharply.  There was far, far too much retelling of the original story. If the reader has not read the original, they are highly unlikely to be buying this sequel. Whole chapters devoted to slavish retelling of the original plot, almost in the same words and with lots of quotes, are unnecessary and turgid. I also understand the clever thinking behind using some of the characters from other Jane Austen books as a crossover, but it simply doesn't work in this book. It has the effect of making those sections slightly cartoonish.  We needed far more of Jane and Bingley. They are not exciting characters in their own right but it would have been interesting to know what had happened to them in the intervening years and for them to have gained some colour during that time. They scarcely figure in this book and detail about their lives would have been far more welcome than a humourless and hysterical Lydia and the deeply uninteresting Wickham. Even his heroic reinvention is uncompelling and seems motiveless. He was far more interesting as a roue and blackguard than as a petulant and half-reconstructed irrelevance.  Elizabeth and Darcy have lost their original spark, perhaps natural after years of marriage and two children, but disappointing to readers who admired her wit, wisdom and wonderful sense of humour, the last of which is entirely missing in this book. Elizabeth has sunk into a life as a pattern wife, subsumed into a bland and subservient character, put on earth only to serve and admire her husband and show him love. She is indistinguishable from Jane in this respect.  And yet to a large extent I enjoyed, although would not re-read this book. In the hands of a professional detective writer, the plot jogged along nicely and I followed a couple of red herrings before being pleased to find I had been neatly fooled. I wanted very much to find out how the plot ended. But the ends were too neatly tied and no one left suffering so it was in no sense a very challenging plot. However, it was reasonably satisfying and I would never say to any Jane Austen fan that it was not worth a read. It has the merit of being considerably better written than most sequels and is perfect for a rainy afternoon with a box of chocolates to hand.  [[ASIN:B00538B69S The Cinnamon Snail]]
B004EPZ084|3.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this flick, there was a heap of hype about it in Australia. To be honest I was left a little dissappointed.... I felt it missed the mark, pretty good comedy plot and some good casting but the script lacked punch. They could have done a lot better.  I really enjoyed Jennifer Aniston as the Phyco, Nympho boss, a very funny change in role for her. Other notables where Kevin Spacey who does evil well. Jason Baitman was also very good as he is with most roles he takes on.  I have given it a three, but it is just a three, a couple of really funny moments..... thats about it, it struggles to get out of second gear. It will be known as a film with good bones and no flesh and wont be a constant player in my DVD collection.

B005K2XM94|4.0|I bought this after I returned the Timbuk2 Sleeve - this one is much better.  The Kindle Fire fits snuggly and the case seals securely.  The case doesn't add too much bulk and provides adequate protection (it's not going to save it from long drops, but definitely will protect it when you drop into another bag.)  The case meets my expectations for the Timbuk2 brand in design, quality materials, and construction.  If they could have incorporated some sort of stand into the design it would be perfect.  Highly recommend.

B0000214F0|2.0|I found Caligula (unrated version) to be boring.  Historically accurate or not, the sex scenes seem inserted just to have sex scenes.  Maybe that was the intention.  Maybe Guccione was trying to \\"gross people out.\\"  I don't think I'm being prudish by pointing this fact out.  Overall, I found it difficult to focus on the acting or any other redeeming quality.  The movie, as another reviewer said, drags on and on.  About one-quarter of the way into the film, I wanted it to end.  I am amazed that any viewer could rate this movie any higher than three stars . . . for any reason.  Don't waste your money.
0446573019|2.0|I'm quite relieved to have come to this review site and find that many others saw the obvious & overwhelming similarity of John Puller (Baldacci) to Jack Reacher (Child.) My husband remarked on it also.  It spoiled the story for me since it was so like Child's most recent book \\"The Affair.\\"  The dialogue seemed silly & stilted.  And I couldn't stop thinking that Puller was no Jack Reacher.  I didn't find Baldacci's writing style as engaging as Child's and got bogged down in places.  That rarely happens to me while reading anything.  The bottom line for me was this; since this book brought to mind a Lee Child character so strongly, it also had me constantly comparing it to Child's work,and I found it lacking.  Doing all this comparing was distracting, it kept me from getting absorbed into the story.  If that makes any sense.  I probably would have felt differently about it had I not been exposed to Child's work first.
B005TZFYNE|1.0|now credit is due to her producers and handlers for the sometimes catchy singalongs and familiar hooks or grooves that sometimes make you forget how much she actually sounds like a chipmunk on one of those Alvin and the Chipmunk albums.  her  voice to  me is the  equal of Tim  Tebow's passing  game in  the NFL. it is pure horror.  mind less banal  songs  and cliched to  cover her  very limited  creativity,however she  is  covered again  because  she keeps  hits,  but how  i  don't know?  she  just  basically puts out  the  same  song  and  album  and  the  formula  seems  to  work,  SMH  big  time.

All the fanservice SK puts in this book is just bonus.  Also, the negatives can be easily overlooked. Those being what I considered a weak ending and some obvious political leanings of the author leaking into the story.  Even if you aren't a constant reader of SK, and even if you think the plot has been done to death, you still won't be able to put down this book.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Every song on this album is amazing. Drake took his time and made the best album of the year so far and honestly the best one I've listened to in quite some time. Also, for all the haters, Drake is not rap, Drake is Drake and you can't replicate that. So if you are expecting an all out rap album then look elsewhere, but if you have an open mind listen to this whole album verse by verse and you will understand.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|I've read bad things about Super 8. After watching it, I don't really understand what some peoples' issue is with it. There was an almost constant smile on my face. The characters were generally likable, the action sequences were well done (though admittedly, the train crash scene probably brought a tear to Michael Bay's eye), the story was simple yet effective, the production values were off the charts. Will this movie be heralded in the future as a classic like, perhaps, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, or E.T.? No. But it's still a great movie, and a lot of fun to watch. J.J. Abrams is quickly becoming one of my favorite modern Science Fiction directors.

B004G8QTS4|5.0|Boone Daniels, the ex-SDPD surfing PI returning from Don Winslow's spellbinding \\"The Dawn Patrol,\\" is in a bit of a funk.  The Pacific's August swell is about as wild as a frog pond, Boone's leggy blonde lover Sunny D has gone pro and is surfing somewhere in the south Pacific, but worst of all, seems that some are abandoning the unwritten surfer code of \\"peace, friendship, tolerance, and individuality\\" and are (gasp) forming gangs and protecting their patches of the ocean.  With that, the cagey Winslow, for my money the world's foremost expert on the combination of surf culture, SoCal, and drug trafficking, shreds another installment of crime, Zen, and Surfbonics wrapped around a new gig for Boone that threatens a dawn patrol wipeout.<br /><br />So \\"The Gentleman's Hour\\" is not only the novel that follows \\"The Dawn Patrol,\\" but also the hours that follow it as well - that time of the morning when Pacific Beach's veteran and legendary surfers roll out of bed and head for the sand - those gray-hairs who, without the inconvenience of regular jobs, can hit the surf at a more civilized hour.  It is in this transition that Boone runs into Dan Nichols, a San Diego success story who took his small inherited fortune and turned it into a very large fortune on the threads of an internationally distributed line of his own surf clothing.  But Dan, unaffected, still cool and still surfing, has a problem: he thinks his trophy wife is cheating on him, and he wants Boone to close the case.  Boone hates the sleaze and voyeurism of adultery cases, but Nichols has the proverbial offer-he-can't-refuse, and before the next wave break Boone is off to the local spy store to stock up on surveillance gear.<br /><br />But Dan Nichols and fidelity problems are merely subterfuge in this fast moving, multi-threaded crime mystery crafted for the ADD set: the real deal is the murder of Kelly Kuhio, a Pacific Beach legend and nearly father figure to Boone, a frequenter of the gentleman's hour who enjoys deity status in and around San Diego's bars and beaches.  Kuhio is murdered in a senseless crime to which Corey Blasingame, the spoiled loser son of a well-healed La Jolla real estate developer, confesses, instantly claiming the title of most despised man in southern California.  Until, that is, Boone agrees to join \\"The Dawn Patrol's\\" hottie Brit lawyer Petra \\"Pete\\" Hall as the defense team's investigator, distancing Boone from his laid back board-toting posse.  Neat crime investigation and well-drawn characters add depth and credibility; local flavor closes the deal.  Add to the wash the shadowy and sadistic \\"Mr. Jones\\" - a one-man torture chamber for a brutal Mexican drug cartel - neo-Nazi martial arts punks, cynical humor, and a generous dose of sexual tension between Boone and Pete for a eclectic mix of frenzy and chill that twists and turns along the way, managing to neatly mesh for a satisfying - and surprising - conclusion.<br /><br />Winslow is the unsung bard of the Pacific Coast Highway; hip, and irreverent, a master storyteller who knows the life of boards and babes and drugs and thugs as he chronicles with authority and panache California's wealth, greed, shallowness and natural beauty.  From serious epics like \\"The Power of the Dog\\" to chilled beach fare like this one, Don Winslow is a talented author who demands to be read - and definitely deserves space on the silver screen.  Check it out now - before Hollywood stumbles over it - and you can tell `em you've been there, read that.n and around San Diego's bars and beaches.

B005J29HCQ|5.0|British novelist Zadie Smith published a collection of occasional essays entitled Changing My Mind (Penguin 2009). Brian Wilson's 2004 reconstruction of the Beach Boys' legendary Smile album was a palpable disappointment to me. However, after listening to the Beach Boys' two-CD set culled from those sessions, I've concluded it was well worth the 44-year wait.  The Beach Boys were Brian Wilson's instrument much as the orchestra was Duke Ellington's. Vocally, these sessions outstrip Wilson's version by miles. They could sing like angels even when the group was in serious trouble. The arrangements are superior to either Wilson's version or the Boys' re-recordings of tracks like \\"Surf's Up\\" and \\"Wind Chimes\\" on Smiley Smile, the uneven record that followed in the wake of the aborted sessions. Though even on this rendition the crunching bombast of its rhythmic patterns can be numbing.  But Wilson was still actively engaged in the production, and was intimate with the Los Angeles studio musicians, many of whom were members of Phil Spector's \\"wrecking crew.\\" You can hear their lively interplay on the second disk. While the set doesn't indicate who the musicians are, I suspect that many of them were on Pet Sounds too.  What I hear now is the whimsy, modesty, and outright silliness of \\"Do You Like Worms (Roll Plymouth Rock),\\" \\"Cabin Essence,\\" \\"Vega-Tables,\\" \\"Barnyard,\\" and \\"Wind Chimes.\\" In their sonic experimentation the sessions are Beatlesque, yes, but they also point to the quotidian dailiness of McCartney's solo albums, even in the musique concrete of construction noise--hammering, sawing, a thumb-smashed \\"Oww.\\"  Except for \\"God Only Knows,\\" I'm not fond of religiosity in pop music, jumping off of Dylan's slow train during his born-again phase. The medieval \\"Our Prayer,\\" which opens the album, makes the \\"teenage symphony to God\\" concept a mite too explicit for my taste, although the segue into doowop, an abbreviated cover of the Crows' 1953 hit, \\"Gee,\\" and later loungemusic, demonstrates Wilson's ecumenical approach to vocal music. In his excellent Guardian review, Alexis Petridis hears \\"doowop, barbershop singing, ragtime, the mock-Polynesian Tiki culture that swept Hollywood in the 50s, pre-rock 'n' roll crooning, yodeling, cowboy movies, You Are My Sunshine.\\"  There is connective tissue like bass lines, the recurrent \\"Heroes and Villains\\" motif, and the return of \\"Our Prayer's\\" harmonies that bridge apparently disparate cuts, and give the album a greater cohesiveness and architecture, although in the end Smile still sounds like brilliant pastiche.  But \\"My Only Sunshine (The Old Master Painter/You Are My Sunshine)\\" and \\"I Wanna Be Around/Workshop\\" have a sort of ghostly melancholy that wasn't apparent on Wilson's 2004 version, since the coarsening of Wilson's voice gave it a quality of humorless earnestness at the loss of its youthful yearning and plaintive beauty. That melancholy ultimately shadows the Smile project much as songs like \\"In My Room\\" were the ache of sadness in the Beach Boys' oeuvre. It wasn't, after all, all smiles. \\"Isolated, dislocated, scared: Smile often sounds like the work of a very lonely man,\\" Petridis astutely observes.  Smile is an aural movie of the mind, particularly the cut to the cantina scene midway through \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" a capsule history of the West in 4:54, a cowboy flick, a South of the Border comedy sketch. It doesn't sound remotely like anything else by the Beach Boys.  According to Petridis, Jimi Hendrix dismissed the re-recorded version as \\"a psychedelic barbershop quartet.\\" On this I have to dissent with Jimi. Yet Petridis identifies a problem with the Beach Boys that I tried to address in earlier posts: \\"Hendrix clearly thought the Beach Boys sounded hopelessly square, and he too had a point. Wilson may have been a genius, the greatest songwriter and studio technician of the 60s, but he was never cool . . . [On LSD] what came gushing out was a warped version of straight-arrow,white-collar American pop culture, the stuff most rock stars in 1967 deemed hopelessly naff.\\" I believe that's correct, though much of that era's psychedelic experimentation hasn't worn well either.  Since for Wilson the Beatles were the gold standard, I've got to give the nod to the Fab Four not only as songwriters but as musicians. The version of Smile on disk one doesn't surpass much less equal the trio of albums that include Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sergeant Peppers. As early as \\"She Loves You,\\" the Beatles as a band were a consummate pleasure machine. The unit seemed to operate on a quasi-mystical plane of intuition and communication that few of us can only aspire to understand. They were incredibly tight.  This was vocally true of the Beach Boys, but in the end, Wilson had to rely on session musicians, and he lacked a collaborator commensurate to George Martin. Sometimes Wilson vacillates between a cappella singing and orchestral busyness. As a lyricist, Van Dyke Parks wasn't Lennon-McCartney by a long shot. His Joycean stream-of-consciousness approach tended to be hit and miss.  In addition to his drug use, record company pressures, and his own nagging perfectionism, Wilson faced resistance within the group, principally from Mike Love who charged that Wilson was \\"f______ with the formula\\" that made the Beach Boys commercially successful in the first place.  In the end what Wilson and Parks created was a work that evoked a childlike, even prepubescent innocence on the cusp of adulthood--\\"Wonderful,\\" the Beach Boys' version of \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" \\"Look (Song for Children)\\" and \\"Child Is Father Of The Man\\" all sound that theme--as well as a tour through and reversion to Americana, the gifts of daily life, the comedy of pratfalls, historical invocations of Plymouth rock `n' roll, home on the range, the \\"church of the American Indian,\\" and a rather dubious pun on the Grand Coulee Dam and the Chinese \\"coolie working the railroad.\\"  \\"Fire: The Elements\\" comes closest to the vertiginous closing chord of \\"A Day in the Life\\"; one feels that it alludes not only to the apocalyptic nature of Los Angeles weather but the chaos of war, assassination and riot raging right outside of Brian Wilson's sandbox circa 1967. In that context, Mike Love's \\"blossom world\\" in \\"Good Vibrations,\\" the end song, seems nothing more than a naive dream.  Rolling Stone's David Fricke concludes his review of the complete \\"five-CD ocean of music\\" by saying that the \\"greatest pop album ever made is still in here, somewhere,\\" but that begs the question of what is there. Reconstructed on the two-CD set, Smile falls short of the greatest work by Bob Dylan or the Beatles--it's less deep--for it relies on that oldest of American myths: our myth of innocence. It's also as beautiful and imperishable as that myth. But the project is tarnished by our knowledge that the surviving Beach Boys sued Brian Wilson after his Smile assemblage, prompting the release of these sessions.  Bad vibrations.  While Paul McCartney longed to \\"get back homeward\\" on the eve of the Beatles' breakup in 1970, perhaps what's truer is Thomas Wolfe's adage, You Can't Go Home Again. Childhood is a country from which we're permanently exiled. It's a paradise lost.  (Originally posted on jazzadvance.com)
0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck uses the story of Cain of Abel to tell us a story about two families, how their paths cross and everyone they meet along the way.  There something amazing about this book. Every time I reread it, I read it slower and read more parts aloud and let the story decide the pace of its telling. I've most recenty listened to the audiobook, while not perfect, having someone speak aloud at a controlled pace has allowed me to picture each detail more completely. And the more detail I could hold in together, the richer the experience becomes.  The number of and the amount of time Steinbeck spends on non-central characters was something I used to find that tiresome at first, having to get to know a new character just when I stopped thinking he was going to put in another one. It was a long time before I reread it, but after that, it became easier to see that Steinbeck wanted to use these characters to more clearly lay down the chain of consequences. I have a feeling that Steinbeck wanted Salinas to be as much a character in the book as the Trasks and the Hamiltons and how, through its citizens coped with the changes from the post civil war era to the early 20th century. Steinbeck grew up in Salinas after all and parts of the story have to do with tracing his lineage and his childhood, and perhaps he wanted the readers to know the town as well as he did (and I by now think it's a perfectly reasonable, respectable decision).   Whether or not you dislike the antagonist of the book depends on what you're willing to accept but John does make an explanation for why she does what she does. This can make it harder what to think about her as a person, if at all. The ideas I had about all the characters at the start of the story weren't exactly the same in the end. In fact, by the end, all I could do was just take the info in and suspend my judgement until I don't know when. Perhaps that's the whole point. He writes as if this has happened to someone we know and lost contact with, someone we wouldn't judge because we know them personally. I guess that's how I know that Steinbeck accomplished his mission.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|There's no need for reviewing the Harry Potter adventures because just about everyone knows what they're about.  With that said - we have every movie and they are never in the same place at same time.  Inevitably the one we want to watch is the missing one!  This box set is going to be a perfect stocking stuffer for my 22 yr old that grew up with Potter and his clan...she's going to love it. The entire set is contained. If and when a \\"better\\" box set comes out - we'll have that too so I can't hold it against this set.

0446547654|4.0|The story of lost love and an old guy that, in death, rekindles that love.  There's a guy in a blazer appearing out of nowhere that just didn't do anything for me.  Personally I think Sparks should stick to the heartfelt stories and leave the paranormal to the professionals.    I thought I didn't like 'The Best of Me'.  Upon completion I was utterly disappointed.  A few days later I realized that it wasn't the story I disliked but that it left me heartbroken. Seriously give it a chance and then wait a few days before reviewing it.  At times we find a book that introduces us to a beloved character - well sometimes we love the characters enough to hate the book.  I don't believe this was Sparks best - but certainly not his worst.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This case has a great fit and is very snug and secure on the iPhone.  The material is very stiff and does not attract pocket lint.  You wont get the protection of an Otterbox with this but it is more than enough to protect against scratches and small drops and such.
B00005R24K|5.0|'Evil dead' is probably one of the very few gore-horror films that will stick to your mind for quite a long time after you have seen it. It is not just about the scares, screams or zombies, the film offers a genuinely spooky atmosphere that grips your mind right from the beginning. Bruce Campbell along with the whole cast, deliver a decent  performances, enough to engage you to the whole scenario. Enjoy the ride and make sure its a Friday or Saturday late night!

0545403359|5.0|Morgpurgo has written other books using World War I as the setting [Private Peaceful].  This story told by Joey, a horse taken from the rural countryside of England to the battlefields of France.  Joey goes through a series of different owners and each offers a very different perspective of the horror and killing that defined trench warfare in World War I.  The cavalry charges in the early months of  World War I graphically represent the senseless loss of horses and humans.    The early reviews of Steven Spielberg's forthcoming movie version of the book have been very laudatory.  I look forward to the movie especially having read the book first.  Young readers will remember the character of Joey in much the same way that I did of Black Beauty.  Some of our best loved stories feature animals as the narrators.   As a middle school librarian I have given away numerous copies of this book to readers who like action, historically-based stories, and memorable characters.

0385344325|2.0|It just makes you feel guilty.  We inhabit a world in which our many emotional economic and family attachments crowd out our autonomy, force us to make compromises with the ambiguities and ambivalences that enmesh us every day. And we're left with a kind of existential angst for which Jack Reacher is a catharsis. After reading a few of these, it now seems that more than 90% of the book is pure formula. I'm tired of the fight scenes, the sex scenes, the cardboard bad guys, the gun porn, the ridiculous coincidences, and the impossible disconnect between the hero and ordinary human feeling.   That said, I admire Child for creating a terrific money machine for himself. He's not getting any more of mine, though. Bye.
0385344325|4.0|This latest novel in the Jack Reacher series is set in early 1997, and Reacher is still a Major in the army. He is sent to a small town, in rural Missisippi to investigate the murder of a young woman. As there is a military base on the outskirts of the town, it is feared that she may have been murdered, by a soldier.<br /><br />As thrillers go, I found this one very good. There are a few 'flaws' in the storyline that other readers have mentioned, and I would have to agree with (e.g. Reacher's reasons for leaving the army etc). Having said that, there was always a an incident or thought, at the end of most chapters in the story that made me want to read on further.<br /><br />Although, there is a certain amount of 'sameness' in this series, I have yet to read a Jack Reacher novel, that I did not enjoy. I look forward to reading the next one.
1451627289|5.0|I'm a fast reader, but I romped through this book.  It's an adventure story, a love story, as well as a thriller.  Did Oswald act alone?  Was it a \\"perfect storm\\" of coincidence that put him on the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository on 11/22/63?  Unless some new evidence appears, we'll probably never know for certain.   However, this novel is more than the Kennedy assassination.  It's about a time in America not so long ago, but oh so different.  Imagine an America without the internet, fast food chains, cell phones, computers, color tv, cable, credit cards, i-pods or mcmansions. Then imagine an America with big cars, big families, respect for teachers, girls spending hours jump roping, community dances, and moms who stayed home, cooked real food and hung the family laundry outside to dry.  This is the world King remembers.  This was my childhood. I'd forgotten many of the details of American life in the late 50's/early 60s until King reminded me.  He made me want to step into that rabbit hole and go back to that time when my family didn't have a key to the front door and my dad left his car keys in the ignition.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is a great movie if you like the governator! I highly suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys terminator 1.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I have listened to the other Twilight related soundtracks, and none of them are even half as good as this one. (in my opinion). Requiem On Water, Cold, and Turning Page  are all incredibly good songs. They fit with the movie so well, and are really touching songs. There are several other good songs. I would say there are two I did not like, but the rest I have listened to for hours. If you are on the fence, listen to the sample and then buy it. You won't regret it.
B0027DK206|1.0|First two packs of film, they were fine. They all came out as it should be. I really liked it a lot. Once I put the third pack, the chemicals were all spit up on the film. It developed only some part. I got greenish redish and white spots all over which means that chemicals have not been developed some parts. My picture was ruined and thought it was the film's fault. I tried fourth pack and realized I have a problem with instant back! I think when the film comes after pressing eject button, it scratches the film where it develops and ruins the picture. I am so disappointed and pissed off because buying films are expensive and instant back was really expensive. I bought it up from Adorama Camera and it's 31 days since I bought it so I doubt it I will get a return or refund. So pissed and mad.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This movie immediately limps out of the gate with a pathetic narration by Morgan Freeman. It doesn't even come close to Mako's original narration over \\"Anvil of Crom\\". I still get chills every time I watch the opening of the 1982 Conan. I'd probably get diarrhea if I ever watched this stupid movie again.   I'm well aware that people claim this movie is closer to Howard's stories than the Arnold movie. But they still chose to use the exact same title and title design as the 82 version, in a sad attempt to gain ticket sales.      They claim this movie \\"is a new interpretation of the Conan mythology, and is not related to the films featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\" Oh really? So, the \\"raiders slaughtered my village, killed my father and stole his sword\\" theme is new?  Then there is the \\"Mystery of Steel\\" which is a direct rip off of the \\"Riddle of Steel\\", which, if I am correct, was an invention of Milius and Stone. And holy frozen lake training sequence, Batman! -do I even have to point out where they stole that idea from?  They even had the nerve to use the Atlantean sword in a promotional poster.     Momoa as Conan was a total casting failure. He is way too pretty to be Conan. He would probably fit in better on Jersey Shore than in Hyboria. He looked like he was trying too hard. At least Arnold possessed the natural arrogance that comes across in Howard's Conan. The supporting characters in this movie could be cut and pasted into a dozen other Pirates of the Caribbean/ Thor/ Clash of the Remake/ 300 or any other \\"Braveheart part 97\\" type movies.   This movie makes the PG rated \\"Conan the Destroyer\\" look like a masterpiece.       It takes more than CGI to make a movie, especially remake a movie. Hollywood totally jacked up \\"Clash of the Titans\\" with the idea that 3D will make up for bad acting, no story and absolutely zero character development. And now they ruined yet another classic. Just wait. Soon they will be promoting \\"The Godfather in 3D\\", staring Justin Bieber as Michael Corleone!    This piece of junk is a disgrace to the legacy of Conan. Crom laughs at this movie!
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|No slam on a good movie but no one seems to remark on the fact that this is loosely based on an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode called \\"Steel\\" with Lee Marvin written by Richard Matheson ( I AM LEGEND, THE SHRINKING MAN, et al). It is a wonderfully entertaining film. Well worth the watch.
1451627289|5.0|I've been an SK fan for a good many years, and I fully expected to enjoy this massive book when I picked it up.  What I didn't expect was to read what is probably his finest work to date.  With writing that is rich and so incredibly heart felt, the author tells the story of a man who not only travels in time to save the world, but also learns to live outside of it's constraints.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a wonderful character, and I was fully invested in his story pretty much from page one.  This is a story that works on many levels.  It's an innovative look at time travel, an alternative political history, and a brilliant piece of historical fiction.  For me, what made it such a success is that it is all of those things, plus a love story, and finally just a story of a man who discovers exactly who he is and what he holds most dear.  It's a personal adventure story full of drama, suspense, and tons of heart.<br /><br />For the SK constant reader, this is a treat that shows just how much an author that many of us have grown up with has matured, and how much his talent has grown.  His keen observant eye is in full evidence as he plumbs the depths of human nature and our capacity for good and evil.  If you are a new SK reader, take the plunge now.  This is a master storyteller at the top of his game.  Don't let the size of the tale intimidate you, it is perfectly paced and zings along at a rate that will leave you surprised when you get to the end.  The plot builds steadily and relentlessly to a conclusion that is chilling and satisfying.  A recommend for SK fans, or any fan of well written literary or speculative fiction.
B00164EAC8|1.0|No stars for this piece of.... well, you know. In this version, Godzilla has no fire breath, runs AWAY from tanks, and is female. Despite what the director says, laying eggs = female (he claimed it didn't mean Godzilla had gotten a sex change; yeah, dude, next time you ovulate, let me know). Bad acting, bad dialogue, scenes directly ripped off from \\"Jurassic Park\\". An insult to Godzilla and his fans.  Everyone who's seen a REAL Godzilla film is pretty much familiar with the genre. Why these clowns felt they needed to \\"reinvent\\" the character is beyond me. As the saying goes, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\".   Godzilla reduced to a big iguana. 'Nuff said.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|The problem I always have with critically acclaimed movies is that my expectations are so high the movie can't ever live up to my expectations. On the other hand, sometimes I'll pick up a movie I have no knowledge of and have read nothing about and I'll love it. I also find that on a second viewing, I like the critically acclaimed movies more than I did on the first viewing. The letdown has passed, and I get more into the movie for what it is, not for what I expected it to be.  So here's the cover hype. Is Super 8 \\"the years most thrilling movie\\"? No. Is it \\"an instant classic\\"? No. But it is, in my opinion, a really good movie that just misses, and it's hard to put your finger on why. The acting is fine, and the kids are engaging. Special effects are right on, and the subplots work their way into the storyline without becoming cumbersome. And the kids are remarkable, even more so after watching the special features about them. The leads never acted before? It's mind boggling.  You can instantly make a comparison to E.T. (Kids & an Alien). But this picture has a totally different feel to it. The kids aren't as innocent, and the Alien isn't as sweet & helpless. They do try to pull a 360 on that fact at the end of the movie, but after raining death and destruction on the town for almost two hours, it's pretty hard to swallow. And there are some really special moments in this film. My favorite is watching Elle Fanning at the train station rehearsing her lines, and the faces on the other actors as they realize how good she is.  So you can see the problem here, nothing but good things to say about the movie, and yet, it just misses. Why? If anyone was holding me down, and needed an answer, I might just have to say that although I am a huge fan of J.J. Abrams (really), maybe the movie would have been better served if Spielberg had occupied the directors chair. Maybe the little thing this movie needed was a touch of Spielberg's magic.  4 stars for the movie, and the fact that I will watch this, I'm sure, more than a few more times down the road. It is engaging and fun, and so I do recommend this for a purchase. If you lower your expectations just a tad, you will enjoy it. Hope this helps.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|Liitle there is to say about Married with children. It is a cult classic that paved the way to many other never quite as successful sitcoms. The only thing that is to critizise here is the awful packaging, all DVDs stacked as if it were a DVD-rom spindle. Really unpractical in handling. On the other hand, at such a prize, they probably saved wherever they could. If you don't mind digging a little bit to access your later seasons it's a great buy with hours of fun in it for you.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|This novel requires some seriously enforced suspension of disbelief, unlike previous Crichton novels. As with Robert B Parker, having his unfinished works completed by a replacement author for Jesse Stone novels and achieved the pinnacle of mediocrity, Micro follows suit. There is powerful science woven into this tale, but with it comes the characters and plot of a children's movie matinee. In many ways this story is an extrapolation of the idea behind Fantastic Voyage, with a group of students being shrunk to millimeter sizing and forced to deal with nightmare predators. I was expecting something more along the lines of Swarm, focusing on actual nanotechnology rather than Honey I Shrunk the Kids. The book is an okay read --as one reviewer put it, it's good to pass time with while taking a plane somewhere. But it lacks the cohesiveness of Crichton's previous works. Much in the same way his Jurassic Park characters used frog DNA to replace missing gene sequences in dinosaurs and suffering for it, the injection of someone else's work to finish Crighton's story has had a similar depressing result. In the end Micro earns a 3 star \\"It's Okay,\\" but I am firm that it's only worth half or less the money I paid.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|First of all I have to admit I am a bit lazy writing product reviews, but after receiving this cover I could not stop my self and feel its unfair not to write a honest review of this product.  I was a bit hesitant after reading all the negative reviews of this product but I thought lets give it a try and now I'm happy that my decision was right....  This case is by far the best case of any tablet like device I have seen so far. It has both the correct form and protection . I own an Ipad and really like the smart cover because of its slickness and style, this cover is almost same style wise as apple smart cover plus it provides extra protection from back.  For all the reviewers who complain about the front cover , they should know that this is the most appropriate thickness , I donot want to have a bulky looking cover for the small tablet like kindle. If you want padding to protect your kindle you rather keep it wrapped in a quilt or even better a pillow, if you want style then get this cover.  The only complaint I have - which is very minor - is that when you close the cover without using elastic, its a bit raised from center and doesnot sit completely flushed over screen like smart cover (the reason could be the extra weight of smart cover due to magnets) .... this could easily be taken care off by having 3 divisions rather that existing 2 in the front and making the a bit heavy from center (maybe put magnets in it).  Overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.
031261246X|5.0|Working in Networking and more specifically network security, I always take books involving hackers, crackers and cyber-crime with a hearty pinch of salt. I am glad to say however, that Zero-Day was delivered ready to serve and perfectly seasoned.  Mark's writing style instantly grabbed me and pulled me into the book. The characters are well developed with a great focus on their traits, backgrounds and personality while still leaving room for twists and surprises.  From a technology point of view, I had difficulty finding anything far-fetched in this book - it was really great to read something that very possibly could happen and the inclusion of little things like assembly code really helped increase the reality.  A fantastic book all round whether your are technically grounded or not.

B003ICWTR4|5.0|For those who have never seen Bruce and the E Street Band live this dvd should be an epiphany. For those who have had the experience, then this dvd is an affirmation of the greatest rock n' roll band ever. A question for the lucky ones who attended: How big was the crowd? Seemed to be 50,000+. Just heard great news that they will be doing Hard Rock again next summer. Lucky Brits!
B000056NX5|4.0|The play is overly glitzy and self-consciously avant guarde.  The thing that really saves this interpretation is the basic music and some of the actors and singers.  In that the directors changed so much of the 'look' of this film but seemingly didn't change the music, I suspect that the music itself must be protected by copyright laws.  If the directors had taken the liberties with the music that they did with virtually everything else, this film would have been a disaster.<br /><br />That said, the music is great as are some of the characters especially 'Judas', 'Pilate', 'Caiphus', 'Anias', 'Simon' and even 'Mary Magdalene'.  'Jesus' is a disaster which I attribute to deliberate misdirection as opposed to poor acting.  The Jesus-character is nerdy, ordinary, silly even girlish.  A 'Messiah' like this couldn't have led a scout troop let alone a major religious movement.  I'll contrast this 'Jesus' with Neeley's 1973 Jesus, a sometimes confused man but wtih interior greatness.<br /><br />The decision to portray Jesus' followers as street people, gangsters and bikers is questionable.  Why not make them up like Pennsylvannia Amish or California surfers?  Portrayal of Pilate and his people as fascist operatives is OK in that the Roman Empire, with its Fasces of Power [sticks bound together with an axe connoting non-lethal and capital punishment] was the original Fascist State from which all others would draw inspiration.  On the other hand, dressing up the crowd screaming for Jesus' death as Orthodox Jews is deeply offensive.  Sure, sure, sure the directors might have been trying to make a contrarian point about some Christian denominations ascribing guilt for Jesus' death as being 'Jewish Guilt' but, in my humble opinion, the directors of this thing way, way overdo it.  It looks and sounds overtly antisemitic or, at the very least, anti-Orthodox Jewry.  Not pretty.<br /><br />It is also confusing.  The powerful Pilate-figure blasts out his power and hatefulness but, when it comes to actually executing Jesus, he is bound by the original lyrics of the play.  Inexplicably, he 'blinks'.  He doesn't want to execute Jesus but finds his hand forced by the antipathy of the Jesus-hating Jewish crowd.  This is truly ironic and confusing.  Big, powerful, strong-voiced Nazi Pilate is nothing but a wimp.  He breaks like a rotten stick.  So here we have a situation in which Nazi-Pilate doesn't want to execute Jewish Jesus but bows down in front of an anti-Jesus Jewish mob.  Weird.uting Jesus, he is bound by the original lyrics of the play.  Inexplicably, he 'blinks'.

B005R4255C|5.0|Immortal is a great soundtrack for the Immortal Cirque de Soleil show. I am enjoying the remixes of some of Michael Jackson's biggest hits and lesser known songs. I don't understand all of the negative reviews because this is a remix album and not an album of new/ unreleased music. The Immortal soundtrack was never advertised as having any unreleased music on it, so it's not like the material is a surprise. Michael's vocals take the centerpiece on the remixes. I especially enjoyed \\"I'll Be There\\" which had Michael's vocals accompained by only a piano. Other stand outs were the album's versions of \\"Will You Be There\\", \\"The Immortal Megamix\\", \\"Dancing Machine/ Blame It On The Boogie\\", \\"Dangerous/ In The Closet\\", \\"Speechless/ Human Nature\\" and \\"Is It Scary/ Threatened/ Somebody's Watching Me\\". I am looking forward to seeing the Immortal Cirque de Soleil show in 2012, and if the soundtrack is any indication the show should be fantastic.

0393330435|4.0|While this book is not a great piece of literature, I found it to be a very interesting read. Wozniak is a great character, and having just completed  \\"Steve Jobs\\" by Walter Isaacson, it was fascinating to contrast the two personalities. Some of the other reviewers stated that Steve Wozniak was arrogant but I thought he came across as humble. In the book when he makes claims such as \\"I was one of the best in the world at...\\" or \\"The Apple II was the first computer to have...\\", it didn't strike me as conceit but as a statement of fact. Overall, I found the book was very enjoyable and that his character was well illustrated.

At first Documents to Go seemed as good as the version I was using on my Palm but after trying different things in Excel I found I didn't like it nearly as much and was not nearly as user friendly as Office Suite Pro.

All in all you get 5 CDs and a DVD (containing lossless stereo mixes, a video and 5.1 remix), a 24 page 12X12 booklet with essay by Robert Fripp/diary excerpts and ephemera, 12X12 replica of the LP gatefold sleeve for current and future generation's to get a glimpse of what it was like to read lyrics and gaze at artwork in its original Album size most preferably performed while listening to said album, 2 King Crimson buttons/badges (the cover and inner sleeve \\"schizoid man\\"), 4 jewel cases (2 double disc) to house all 6 discs and in a mysterious white envelope two 8X10 glossy b&w press kit photos of the 1969 lineup and then of course there's the Glorious Music.<br /><br />I am drawn to the LP transfers even listening on my MP3 Ipod, theres something vibrant in the murkiness of these mixes. Included is the British Stereo and American Mono LP Vinyl recordings that have been \\"de-clicked\\" to cut down on excessive vinyl surface noise. The Bonus tracks are fascinating, The (duo version/Fripp & McDonald) of \\"I Talk To The Wind\\" is just stunningly beautiful and with or without vocal track \\"Epitaph\\" remains one of the greatest emotionally gloomy tracks ever committed to tape.<br /><br />Alongside the Nice and Procol Harum this is where Progressive Rock started and it started Brilliantly.<br /><br />One would be hard pressed to dream of including any further versions of the record on a CD set as included herein is the 2009 Stereo Remaster, the 2004 Master Edition remaster, British stereo vinyl, American mono vinyl and an \\"Alternate Mix\\" version alongside studio outtakes, single mixes, BBC recordings and Live concert performances. Disc 6 which is the DVD includes the 2009 5.1 Remix as well as MLP Lossless Stereo (24/96) and PCM Stereo (24/48) encoded versions of the 2009, 2004, alternate mix and outtakes from the 2 disc 2009 re-issue.<br /><br />So There!!!, No Complaints!!, Just CRIMSO!, Music as remarkable as this deserves the kind of treatment, respect and excitement this package delivers.ossless Stereo (24/96) and PCM Stereo (24/48) encoded versions of the 2009, 2004, alternate mix and outtakes from the 2 disc 2009 re-issue.

B004EPZ03O|4.0|At the end of the day, the underlying subject of this movie is:  \\"We are The Muppets: If modern society decides we are no longer funny and popular, we're ok with that.  We are just here to entertain for those who will appreciate.\\"<br /><br />I'm not a professional critic, so there's no need for me to bore everyone with an over-analyzed, granular review.  What I can say is I (like many folks) have been a die hard Muppet fan since I was a kid in the early 80's.  Jim Henson was a genius and the world became a slightly darker place when we lost him.  I lost touch with The Muppets over the years as they tried to re-envision themselves and relate to a new generation.  Though still popular, it wasn't the same to me.  This new film is the closest thing that I have seen in attempting to return to their truly zany days when you had Henson, Oz, Hunt, and Nelson leading the charge.<br /><br />Jason Segel (who co-wrote the screenplay) didn't have to do his research.  It's obvious he has been a fan of the Muppet-brand of humor for a long time.  There were so many subtle homages to the classic essence of Henson and The Muppets that will fly under the radar of many, and yet they still managed to write a genuinely, caring story that will hold the attention of a new generation.  Also, in the tradition of classic Muppet movies, keep your eyes peeled for \\"blink and you'll miss them\\" cameos by movie stars of all generations.<br /><br />Additionally, I would like to point out that it was refreshing to see a plethora of classic, overlooked Muppets from the past getting their time in the spotlight in this movie:  Lew Zealand, The News Anchor, Marvin Suggs, Uncle Deadly, along with the ALWAYS hip Electric Mayhem just to name a few.<br /><br />I will close this review by saying, the absolute best part of seeing this movie was NOT looking around and seeing adults and kids in the theater laughing together at the same moments, but sitting next to a woman about my age with her two kids.  (**Very minor spoiler) - - During a scene in which Walter is looking around the old Muppet theater, old pictures on the wall featuring Jim Henson and other Muppet history came into view.  I heard the mom next to me sniffle, and I too wiped a few tears away.  Her daughter leaned over and whispered, \\"....why are you crying?\\".  Her mother turned to her and said, \\"...you wouldn't understand.\\"  I couldn't have said it better.minor spoiler) - - During a scene in which Walter is looking around the old Muppet theater, old pictures on the wall featuring Jim Henson and other Muppet history came into view.

B0063IH60K|4.0|As others have said, the ads in this game are just about the most annoying ever.  If you're ok with that, I have to say, I think this is just about the best looking/designed solitaire game for android.  It works well on my phone and on my Kindle Fire. The cards are nice looking, the graphics are nice, the game play is pretty smooth.  Its unfortunate it's only 1 game, but I've tried just about all of them and keep coming back to this one.
B005KAH7QU|5.0|good cast, good directing, well worth watching....highly recommended.  very unique and really liked the soundtrack and cinematography.  definitely had an indie film feel to it.
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|Admittedly, I not only haven't sessioned the whole set yet, but I only listened to the 5.1's from each set and in fact am hearing the Signals dvd audio as I write this. I don't know if anyone else has noticed yet, but they have in most cases used totally different vocal takes, some different instrumental tracks, and in the case of The Weapon, a completely different take altogether - note the extra measures before the choruses. I've noticed alternate takes and extra tracks on other 5.1 remixes I own, they even used a different vocal take for Vital Signs on the Moving Pictures blu ray - I can see how the mixer can be tempted by the available options. But this is like an alternate version of the album, and I for one am pretty stoked about it. So any Rush freaks on the fence, just know that not only are the 5.1's superb sounding, but you'll have what amounts to a fresh angle on the Signals experience. Check out the other reviews for opinions on the sound quality of the regular cds - like I say, I haven't gotten around to those yet, and I think the packaging is just fine. But I got excited about the Signals thing, and I wanted to share.<br /><br />By the way, noticed some others had problems with the Farewell to Kings dvd audio. Mine plays fine, just using a plain old Pioneer DV610AV dvd audio/sacd player.<br /><br />Rush are a fine young band, and I predict big things for them.

1451627289|5.0|I'm mad at you Mr. King for making a book so compelling that I couldn't put it down.  My house is in a shambles.  My kids are I-don't-know-where.  I lost 5 pounds because I couldn't pull myself out of the spine long enough to eat.  If that weren't enough, I went on Audible and downloaded it.  I've listened to it twice.  Thanks for making such a great book that I hear the echoes of this new masterpiece even after I pull the earbuds from my head.  I've told my kids that the earbuds are a medical necessity.  Thanks, Mr. King.  I loved it from Page 1 to the last.  Great start.  Even better ending.  Rich characters, in-your-face humanity with all of its ups and downs, well-researched and a plausible story if time travel were possible.  Loved it.  It's 2nd only to your Dark Tower series which I can recite verbatim.  So, I guess I'm not too mad at you, Mr. King.  Thank you.

I just want to say that I really loved this unconventional love-story.  If you can suspend your dis-belief, and go with the flow, you will love this book as well.  I couldn't put it down.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! The wedding was all I had hoped it would be; finally Bella and Edward are happy and together at last forever!  However, the scenes with Bella when she gets sick are truly upsetting and I hated to see her that way, so realistic!  I could not wait for that to pass!  I was so glad that I had read the book first and could really understand what was going on which was a little hard to depict in the movie.  Too bad the movie was not longer; I would definitely not have complained!<br /><br />Susan Kelley, Author<br />[[ASIN:B003FMUWH6 Ghostly Encounters of the Paranormal Kind]]

B0053JJLLC|2.0|Being a fan of Michael Crichton's previous novels, I pre-ordered this for my own Thanksgiving literary feast.  Well, like an undercooked turkey, this book is a tremendous disappointment.  Any resemblance between this cartoonish piece of writing and Michael Crichton's original works is totally absent.  This is written as though it is an outline for a film script, just waiting for the special effects designers to get to work and make it into a big screen 3D spectacular.  No matter what you thought of Michael Crichton's opinions, you were presented with substance and references and logic and facts to substantiate his conclusions.  I'm 25% through with the book in an hour, and I do not have the tenacity to finish it.  This book should be titled:  Honey, I Shrunk Your Book Budget!.     If you did not pre-order this...run, do not walk to any $.99 thriller, and save your money for pumpkin pie.
B005ILWOZA|3.0|I'm one of James Morrison's biggest fans. His first CD was on my iPod favourites continually. I bought his 2nd CD the day it came out and liked it even more than the first one. I had been anticipating his new CD for months, so much so that I preordered it weeks before it was released. When it finally arrived I was so disappointed. Where was the poet that I had come to love and relate to. His first 2 CDs didn't seem to give a damn about being like everyone else while this one is trying too hard to fit it. Just sing from your heart James and go back to writing like the poet that you are. I liked about half the songs so I'll give it 3 stars.
1586487981|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book.  The authors start from the premise that the very words \\"world poverty\\" are so overwhelming and intractable to laymen that one's first impulse is to retreat from the whole subject and pass this book by; however generous our instincts on first thought, \\"there is really no point\\", the two brilliant professors begin, since our very next thought will likely be: \\"our contribution would be a drop in the bucket, and the bucket probably leaks\\". They instantly captured my heart and mind with the next sentence: \\"This book is an invitation to think again, again: to turn away from the feeling that the fight against poverty is too overwhelming, and to start to think of the challenge as a set of concrete problems that, once properly identified and understood, can be solved one at a time.\\"  This is the surprisingly, wonderfully simple premise of the book-- rather than getting hung up on the \\"big questions\\" of what causes poverty and whether free markets and democracy are good for the poor, put these endless debates aside and allow the authors to focus us on \\"what really matters: not so much where the money comes from, but where it goes. This is a matter of choosing the right kind of project to fund -- food for the indigent, pensions for the elderly, or clinics for the ailing? -- and then figuring out how best to run it.\\"  In other words, beware analysis paralysis and drill all the way down to practical real-life problem-solving at the most concrete level.  Example: malaria continues to kill nearly one million African children a year, a number which can be cut in half or more by getting the children to sleep under insecticide-treated bed nets, if only they would.  Now here's the rub: unless you get right to the micro man-in-the-street level, you cannot know whether it is better to give the nets away freely or to charge a little bit for them or even to pay parents to assure their kids use them.  The authors illustrate that these need be seen not as abstract philosophical questions, but rather as concrete questions answered by studying individual behavior to test  whether a \\"freebie\\" devalues the bed-net such that it gets converted to a fishing net-- a  result that mmight differ if families were made to pay at least some of the cost or were actually paid to compel use of the nets.  Over and over, the authors hone in on fundamental behavior studies to show how much progress can be made in improving diets, healthcare, schooling, etc when good hard thinking produces the right ground-level questions to ask. Everyone should buy this book since it is written precisely for the every man in exquisitely accessible, nearly jargon-free prose. If you choose not to buy it, at the least spend a little time on the book's hugely helpful, beautifully illustrated [...] website. You will be inspired to follow many suggestions there for how to help and become confident that real progress is being made in the struggle to remediate world poverty.

B005TQAI6G|1.0|It was absolutely draining to watch from the beginning to end.  My roomate is an extreme fanboy who made me watch this online with him.. utter mess.. the visuals where uninspiring, the voice/audio  (or lack of) is all messed up.. its an utter mess.. stay away. the only people who will find this even ably tolerable are only the dellusional fanboys who worship this girl simply because of their nostalgic likings to her. stay away.. ahhh!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|Not worth the money. Very little if any protection. Will not stay propped up like it shows. Seems like a very rushed attempt to capitalize on the release of the KF.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I absolutely loved this film, saw it in the theater three times because the kids were so good. I felt that the mood and the feel of 1980 was spot on. I very much identified with them... I thought to myself 'this is exactly what it was like being a kid in those days' and loved every second. The kids' banter was well written and sounded like actual kids, not watered down... The dad's frustration with the son felt so believable... And the effects were awesome.  But... (spoiler)  Couldn't there have been a better ending? It would have been a simple thing to do to have the kid simply find some crucial part of the spaceship hidden in the dead teacher's storage bin... Or something like that... Couldn't they have helped in SOME way? The dad was running around like a super hero on a mission, and i couldn't wait to see how it was going to wrap up, how the dad and the kids would come together and save the day... And they simply 'met up' in town, just in time to see the alien depart. There was no feeling of 'finally the alien can go, because he met the nice kid and his friends.' it was kind of a let down...   Again, i will buy it because it was SO great otherwise... But it could have been a masterpiece.
B004LUS390|4.0|Works great on kindle fire, except when you zoom in to draw it freezes and force closes. But if you can live with that its an amazing app. Well worth the $1.99.
B001FA0NZ6|4.0|I'm not a girl who usually gets her makeup advice from books, but the Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual is truly a must-have. Fantastic, step-by-step instructions are illustrated to achieve just the right looks you need for any occasion, whether it's just a casual day out with your friends, or a formal event like a wedding.  I didn't get this one from Amazon (I got it on sale used at a book store) but now I can see that on Amazon, it's not expensive for what you're actually getting!  It's a good book to keep on your shelf, it's even good just for fun-reading. Buy, buy, buy!
B004DK5CW4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, despite the fact that (as others have mentioned) Disney took some liberties with history.  If that kind of thing bothers you, be prepared for it - they \\"enhanced\\" some characters and add-libed a few things, as well as deleting others (like Riva Ridge).  If you think you can get over that, it's a nice feel good movie.  I enjoyed the portrayal of Penny - after all she did do a lot for being \\"just a house wife\\" and I am sure that it took some perseverance on her part (I loved the scene in the all male club, whether it really happened or not!).  It may have been a bit over done, but I am sucker for strong female characters.  I also liked the cursory covering of his lineage; while cursory it was nice to at least see it mentioned, as many movies like this ignore it or gloss over it completely.  I also thought they handled the syndication well.<br /><br />The ending of this movie also felt very anticlimactic; he won the last race and it pretty much ended.  I was expecting either a flash to the future to cover his death, or at least some mention of his breeding record and death.  After all, they did info blips on the people, why not the horse....the movie was about him!  As I recall he did fairly well as a stud, and I think that should have at least been mentioned.

B001BEK8E2|5.0|Roshomon is beautiful in ever way; the story line is excellent, the acting is genuine, the script is realistic and not filled with fluff, the camera angles are perfection, and it's as much a story of an incident as an exploration of human nature.<br /><br />It's the story of the murder of a man told from several different angles; the robber; the wife; the murdered man; and the woodcutter. Each view varies differently and every story is changed a little (or a lot). It makes the viewer constantly question which story is true or which parts of each story are true, even after watching the movie dozens of times.  It also makes the viewer consider \\"point of view\\" in everyday life, how the same incident is seen in several different lights and how can it be that 3 people can witness the same thing and come to different conclusions.

B002KSPKRS|3.0|I bought the X41 headphones yesterday at Best Buy hoping to get a better product from my aging Turtle Beach X11 headset.  Well....for the price, the X41s are not that much better than the X11s.<br />First off the surround sound is excellent, although there is hardly much bass effect with these headphones.  There's a bass button on the headphones themselves, but it's just an on/off button...there's no bass gain or dial to increase or decrease the bass.  The on/off button gives a bit more bass in video gaming sound, but not much.  The X41s don't feel as comfortable as the X11s do.  The left and right earpieces seem to be a bit smaller (more circular - 50mm) than the oval ones (40mm) found on the X11s.<br />The plastic also feels chinsey and light....being light, you would think that would be a GOOD thing for a headset, but not so much with these. Didn't really feel like quality plastic...not for $150 headphones.  The wireless signal was very good....no humming or hissing noises, although there are no cordless phones or wireless routers in the same room, which could be the reason I had no interference issues with sound.  Reception was loud and crisp.  I could walk about 14' away from the receiver until the sound started to crackle and lose reception.<br />The batteries go fast in the headpiece.....two AAA batteries didn't go very far, about 8hrs of play.  There isn't any warning beep if the headset gets too low on power, it just shuts off when the juice is up!  I thought there was something wrong with the headset until i realized that the batteries were dead. Kind of surprised two fully charged rechargable batteries died that quickly.<br /><br />Overall the sound quality of the X41s are good, especially the surround sound.  The only thing lacking is the bass which is a shame for games like Battlefield 3, where I wanted to hear the \\"boom\\" of the gunfire and tanks roaring nearby....didn't really get that from these headphones.  I love the fact that they are wireless but I don't think they fit as comfortable as the X11s and the batteries in them die way too fast.  Plan on having a couple of extra sets available when playing for long durations.<br /><br />I returned these X41s to Best Buy and bought the Turtle Beach DX11...which is basically a pair of wired X11s along with a DSS (digital surround sound) emitter, which is the same emitter used in the wireless base of the X41s.....this little doodad is what makes the \\"surround sound\\" possible in a pair of headphones. So now i don't have to worry about wireless battery life and the little DSS doodad can be used with any pair of headphones to reproduce surround sound...not just with the X11s.hey fit as comfortable as the X11s and the batteries in them die way too fast.

0062014102|5.0|As mentioned elsewhere, the first third of this book presents the Holographic analogy as theorized by David Bohm and Karl Pribam. The rest of the book presents supporting evidence from across the spectrum, covering everything from historical miracles to LSD experiences.<br /><br />Certainly, some of the evidence is questionable from a scientific point of view, and the author makes a few misleading oversimplifications along the way. I think that both of these faults are excusable, considering he is writing for the layperson. Sometimes an exact explanation requires specialized background knowledge beyond the ken of most laypeople.<br /><br />I did find that some of the chapters compiling evidence dragged a bit, but understood that the author was trying to be thorough. My favorite sections were those concerning out-of-body and near-death experiences, both of which were very well-presented by the author.<br /><br />I do think this book fails to present one of the strongest points of evidence in support of the Holographic Paradigm: the black hole information paradox, and string/M-theory. This is perhaps understandable as a thorough presentation of this evidence would probably have added another hundred pages to the length of the book, while taking casual readers through some of the most complex gymnastics in physics.
0812550706|4.0|I'm usually skeptical of stories that star children as the main protagonist. I particularly disliked how the Harry Potter made Harry played upon all the old tropes of child heroes (orphaned, mean stepparents, talks to animals, etc) and portrayed him as superior by birth. By contrast, Orson Scott Card gets it mostly right with Ender Wiggins in Ender's Game. Ender is brilliant - a bit too much so for my taste - but he's also a child and emotionally frail. The real story isn't how Ender defeats the bad guys, but rather how Ender deals with the rigors of training and engaging in battle. The only part of the story I thought went to far is the subplot with Ender's siblings, Peter and Valentine, who plot to take over the world. It's a bit silly seeing two kids writing brilliant political op-eds and it actually doesn't have a whole lot to do with the main story of Ender in Battle School. Other than that, a recommended read for sic-fi fans. The audio narration is particularly good and is Scott's preferred medium for telling the story.
B0057R5XRG|3.0|Pros:  1. The movie, a must have for Jurassic Park fans.  2. DTS-HD 7.1 Audio, very impressive, if you have a good set of home theatre.  Cons:  1. The picture of the blu-ray verion is so grainy like old DVD-5 (4.7GB) movies.   2. The price, I bought it at 29.99 during black friday deals week but its original price is 49.99. For its low picture quality, it is not worth the money, but for 29.99, it is a great deal.

B004EPYZTE|5.0|I believe that Robert E Howard would have approved this version of Conan with high fives, thumbs up and all smiles. Beautiful cinematography. Great sets. Top notch acting -- I loved the grittiness and realism, much of the 'high-quality' filmmaking experienced in viewing Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. 3D was well done but not distracting. Jason Momoa captured Conan exactly how I picture Conan from the books I grew up on.<br /><br />Momoa's Conan was smart with purpose, not the wise-cracking, muscle-hunk that Schwarzenegger portrayed. The pirates, the kingdoms, everything was as-the-books-portrayed. This movie was made by people who wanted to capture Howard's world of Conan. I hope they make more in this series. With the same quality of story and character.<br /><br />I will watch this movie many times. Note -- we have a 73\\" high definition TV with 3D and surround sound -- so we really got to view (and hear) this movie in a perfect setting. The nudity and violence did not bother me, but may make some hesitate -- they went for realism and they succeeded brilliantly. A+ movie on 3D BluRay.
B005V20JKI|3.0|first off, this is a really good looking game. lovely character design, nice animation. the bigger issue, as pointed out by others, is that it's just not that much fun. enough of a challenge to be interesting for a few minutes, but not much more.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|I was first introduced to Florence+the Machine last year.  A friend of mine made me a mixed CD with Heavy in Your Arms on it.  I was hooked.  I had to hear more.  I purchased Lungs and was completely blown away.  It had been a long time since an album had that affect!    I was able to see her in concert at the Greek in LA and she was nice enough to sing us a song from her upcoming album!  I was ecstatic!    Ceremonials is truly an amazing collection of songs.  Her voice is haunting and her lyrics are macabre.  Rarely does a Sophomore album trump the first one...this one does exactly that.  Currently, I am totally into Spectrum.  But I know that like Lungs, I will love all the songs and the music will speak to me when I need it to.    Enjoy!!
B004EPZ03O|2.0|Beginning with one of the happiest, and most uplifting songs I've ever heard in my life, titled \\"Life's A Happy Song,\\" this film was headed in all the right directions.  Instead, it takes a dark and rather depressing turn, doing for the Muppets what \\"Babe: Pig in the City\\" did for that franchise.  Jason Segel and Amy Adams are very likable as the main actors, and the new \\"whistling\\" Muppet is great, but it would have been good to see some of the funnier character like Ratzo, Peppe the Prawn, and Gonzo doing some funny bits.    There are so many great characters to work with here, they really missed a golden opportunity to bring back a winning franchise.  Next time, maybe Disney will let their Pixar team tell the story...
1451627289|5.0|King has really hit a home run with this story, and this after already coming out with a couple other home runs in the last couple years with Duma Key and Under the Dome. Still, as good as both those were, neither of them really came close to being as compelling, poignant or as thrilling as the heights King reaches in his latest masterpiece, especially given the controversial nature of the ending of the Under the Dome for some. (Personally I wasn't bothered by it but it didn't do much for me either). While I've been a life long fan of Kings for his ability to tell gripping, suspenseful and often scary stories, it's his ability to develop very believable characters that I love and can relate to that keep me coming back for more. In 11/22/63, he creates a set of characters in Jodie, Texas that are among his finest creations since the Dark Tower series or The Stand.<br /><br />While I won't spoil any thing about the story itself because it wasn't at all what I thought it might be going into the story, I will say that much like the main character in this book, I'm not a person who cries often and very few stories have the power to move me to that level of emotion, but this story did just that and not just once, but several times throughout the book. It's a true testament to the wonderful character's he's created here and this one is going to stick with me for quite a while.<br /><br />I don't really have any complaints of any kind about the book which is a rare thing for me as well, though the book didn't surprise me as much as a King book usually does. Still, given the themes running throughout the story, I guess it's not that surprising that the events that unfolded were not exactly unexpected. The story has many powerful moments from the tragic, to the uplifting, the romantic to the devastating and everything in between and manages to keep the story at a pace that makes the 850 page story feel about half as long. I won't go into any more detail than what I've talked about to this point because I really think the book is best read without any expectations going into it, just know that this is among King's finest works that truly anyone who enjoys a well crafted story can enjoy.t because I really think the book is best read without any expectations going into it, just know that this is among King's finest works that truly anyone who enjoys a well crafted story can enjoy.

0763652245|5.0|From lollipops to rabbit plops, burnt ghosts to hot toast, strawberry tea to goblin pee there are many things to be discovered inside the witch's kitchen. Open the refrigerator door to the left and you may discover something yummy, but open it to the right and you may discover something terribly yucky.<br /><br />My two year old daughter adores this book! This is another book that I was weary of with all the flaps and openings because she is unfortunately very brutal on books (well, everything). Not that she always does it on purpose, it's just that our sweet Littlebug is a bit of a klutz. So how do I know when she truly loves a book? Well, in the case of a pull/lift/flap/etc. book I know because she treats it with extra special care and that's exactly what she's been doing with What's in the Witch's Kitchen?. She's been bringing it to me quite often over the last few weeks and I've even caught her one or two times opening and closing the little flaps with the utmost care.<br /><br />Each page has the option of opening a different item in the witch's kitchen to discover either very yummy or yucky things by flipping the flap to the left or right. To be honest, at first I couldn't figure it out. It took my four year old son showing me how to do it (yes, my four year old is smarter than I am). The flaps, though appearing to only open one way can actually open either and it's so so neat! Both the kiddos and myself have sat flipping the doors back and forth for quite some time because it's just so much fun. Then, at the end you have the great surprise of a full two page pop-out witch coming to life before your eyes!<br /><br />What's in the Witch's Kitchen? by Nick Sharratt is a creepy spooky story that even the littlest Halloween fans will appreciate and their parents will happily read to them. Filled with delightful rhyming texts and adorable illustrations it's easy to help the very youngest of readers enjoy a sometimes scary holiday. As you flip back and forth the doors, cupboards and more readers will discover just exactly the witch has hidden in her kitchen. Could it be a yummy treat or something dreadfully yucky?<br /><br />My original review was posted at There's A Book.will discover just exactly the witch has hidden in her kitchen.

B004EPYZT4|3.0|To many bad elements mar this film. The bar was set very high for this film because of the expectations of hard core conan fans and the excellent robert milius original film from 1982. The film lacks atmoshphere and the character development scenes feel outright flat. This feels very much like any other big money hollwood action movie,   Pro's are it has Interesting scenery and costumes, the casting is actually not bad at all. Jason Momoa is not a bad choice as is evidenced by his very strong ( and less wordy) portryal of Khal drogo on game of thrones. Rose Mcgowan is sexy and witchy. The main villain Stephen Lang has some chops and charisma.   The problem with this film ( there are more than a few) is that the movie feels contrived instead of sincere. Real cinematic story telling takes patience and it has to challenge the viewer to care about the story and characters. This is absolutely a dumbed down, fast paced, cut scene to cut scene movie. Some of the violence was particularly over the top and lame and lacked impact. Conan torturing a guy and sticking his finger through his nose hole to bleed him to death to me was a cheap attempt at shock value. Alot of big money was spent on the production of this movie to no avail. It looked very glossy, to be honest it looked alot like pirates of the carribean rather than conan the barbarian.  I will watch this film one more time and see if i like it better the second time. As far as the people giving it one star. It is not that bad.
B004EPYZTE|2.0|HELLO,  THIS IS JUST MY OPINION, SO TAKE IT AS SUCH.  THIS MOVIE SUCKED.  THE ORIGINAL CONAN WAS AND STILL IS, THE ONLY ONE.  ARNOLD WOULD HAVE MADE LIGHT WORK OUT OF THIS DUDE.  YOU CAN NOT MAKE UP FOR ACTING WITH SPECIAL EFFECTS.  THE CAST OF THE ORIGINAL WAS GREAT.  THIS NEW ONE, NOT SO MUCH.  I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE NOT NAMED IT CONAN.  THANKS
B005DMNS4A|2.0|I love this album, and have since plunking down $4.99 to buy it at my closest PLAYBACK store in 1973. I take a slightly different view of remastered and remixed reissues. I believe they all deliver pluses and minuses, and like music composed centuries ago, can be open to edits of all types: performance, mixing, instrumentation, mastering....<br /><br />There are a few points I like here: On most, if not all, tracks, the background sea and environmental sounds are more distinct. Acoustic instruments, drums, and bass seem more pronounced in most cases.<br /><br />However, the guitar seems to cloud Roger's vocals. The mid-range with synthesizers, vocals, and electric guitars seem to overload my ears. This version of the coda, LOVE REIGN O'ER ME, one of rock's most powerful and meaningful songs, sounds like a mass of noise on this version.<br /><br />Demos don't prompt me to purchase reissues. This is definitely not the original 1973 LP release. Lyrics on The Real Me, the seal sound on Dirty Jobs, and the upfront guitar lick on Sea And Sand reveal this is the 1996 version. Not that that's necessarily bad. I like both versions equally, actually. I just don't like being misled, even unintentionally.<br /><br />All the best,<br />GT
B002ZG999U|5.0|People who enjoy action movies will enjoy this film. Stallone and Stratham are superb. Willis and Shwartzerneger have quick appearances. Everyone adds to the tenseness and drama. Stallone has the lead role, and he directed the film and co-authored it. Stallone's character heads a group of near crazy mercenaries, men unafraid of death, men extremely capable of fighting, hand to hand and with weapons. Stallone is offered a job for five million dollars to kill the head of an island, but he soon realizes that he is being set up, that the people who hired him think of him as expendable, that they think he has no chance of surviving the job. Then he develops his own reason for doing what he would have been paid to do.

Now, when Wilson in 2004 released his and his band's interpretation of SMILE, though I knew it was re-recorded, it still gave me the first defined compilation we all had been waiting for.  This new box set, is not meant to be that - I appreciate it's raw tracks and quality.  I will enjoy the tracks and see what thhe foundation of SMILE was intended to be.  However, if one wants to hear a finished product - you gotta Brian's solo release of SMILE.

Have we become so ignorant, or coddled, that we no longer know how to take care of our rights, our freedoms. It's Thanksgiving today, and I'm worried that we've become so used to having certain 'rights', that we're taking our Rights &amp; Hard-won Freedoms for granted, blithely giving or power away. Not even taking ONE MINUTE TO READ the TERMS. We'll soon have no security or freedoms left, not if we continue to give them away in exchange for a folder. gees, we're totally acting like priviledged kids, clueless to what our parents, grandparents, etc., have fought to leave for use. Just like Bush Jr. did when he squandered the surplus that could've paid off Medicare &amp; Social Security for years to come. (because kids who've always been provided for just 'know' that money will always magically appear when you need it.) Oops, Shrub sure squandered that amazing surplus.   But now thousands of use are making similad ASSUMPTIONS,  about how we'll continue to have our priviledged, incredible freedoms. So we sign away our rights in this app, thinking we'll always have our freedoms, right? But if we don't protect them, who will?  Find another app that doesn't cost so much.

However the film tries to make its point clear in hope to raise awareness of current problems in our food industry and in my opinion it does this job perfectly.

B003E8P9G0|4.0|I loved this book!  I give it four stars right off the bat (fives are rare gems indeed).  Even though it is written for \\"tweens\\" and very young adults, and not in a mentally engaging way for an older crowd (cough, cough--me), I still really liked it.  Riordan has a way with words.  While some of the storyline of The Red Pyramid seemed \\"juvenile\\" to me, it didn't override the story, and I just had to keep reading.  Riordan is capable of entrancing adult readers too, and that's what I love about him--that's why I'm able to keep on reading his books.  Sometimes I pick up young adult books to peruse and end up putting them right back down... I feel like they are trying too hard to reach \\"kids\\" through the lingo used, etc.  Thankfully I've never had this problem with Riordan.<br /><br />The Red Pyramid is written much differently from the Percy Jackson series in that the reader actually becomes a part of the story through the use of second person narration.  You, the reader, are actually \\"reading\\" a transcript of voice-recorded tapes that the two protagonists left behind.  You are, therefore, invited right into the story, as your quest becomes finding \\"the locker\\" and using the combination that the protagonists give you--but in order to do that, you must \\"hear\\" their tale, because you, too, could be like them.  I am highly interested to see how Riordan is going to continue this usage of second person narration in the upcoming sequel, The Throne of Fire, releasing this May--just a few months away.  The end of The Red Pyramid makes it sound like you (the reader) have to find the locker and meet the protagonists in Brooklyn in order for the story to go on, so this narration style could get quite interesting.<br /><br />I also just want to point out that in this book it is vital that you read everything.  For instance, there is a \\"Warning\\" listed on the page between the table of contents and the first chapter, and an \\"Author's Note\\" after the completion of the novel.  Both of these aspects are actually a part of the novel themselves, though traditionally an author's note deals with \\"thanks\\" and the research component of the novel.  However, times are changing, and I've noticed in newer books that the author usually has some type of introduction to the story prior to the first chapter (a must read, but usually glanced over by accident).  Likewise, on occasion the author will also have something after the conclusion of the novel, so it's good practice to read everything just in case!

B0044CG71G|5.0|\\"Olivia\\" is a fantastic start to season 3.  I thought the season 2 2-part finale was one of the best 2 hours of TV ever, in taking us to the alternate universe and significantly expanding the mythology in a very exciting and believable way.  I was happy to find that season 3 starts off strongly, taking place in the alternate universe.  Without going into spoilers, the highlight of the episode is Ana Torv's acting.<br /><br />In the first 2 seasons Ana Torv did not make much of an impression simply because she came off as very one note---cold and focused.  When given good material to work with, like \\"Olivia,\\" she is simply amazing, showing the confusion and vulnerability of this character we have been following for 2 seasons.  Also notable is guest actor Andre Royo (Bubbles from The Wire).  The two actors have great chemistry.<br /><br />Also fun is picking out the subtle differences between our universe and the alternate universe.  I look forward to Ana Torv's basically playing 2 different characters this season.  It's also fun to see Lance Reddick, Kirk Acevedo, John Noble, etc. playing alternate versions of their characters.

B005M48EKC|2.0|This product is extremely misleading.  This book is not a \\"TV-tie-in\\", at all, aside from the fact that they put the girls from the show on the cover.  This is the same exact book as the first book in the Pretty Little Liars series, with a different cover slapped on it. :-<br /><br />  I recently read the original book, and got the \\"TV-tie-in\\" in hopes of reading something a little more like the show (which I like much better).  But, as soon as I opened the book, I could tell that it was the same version that I'd just read.  And, upon further inspection of it, I could tell that it is not amended to reflect the contents of the show.<br />  If this was a TV-tie-in, they would have changed details like the girls' ages (making the time that Alison disappeared when they were in early high school, not mid-way through Jr. High), and changing the physical descriptions of the characters to fit who's who on the show (as they do not fit the particulars laid out for their respective characters in the book).<br />  Being that I didn't want to read the whole book over, I could be wrong about it being EXACTLY the same, but I don't think that I am.  This is marketing greed at some of its worst, and truly disappointing! :-(<br />  If you haven't read the first Pretty Little Liars book, and want this edition because you prefer the cover, then you can get it...But, if you've already read it/own it in its original form, the only thing this version is good for is a collectible if you like the cover because you're a big fan of the show.  I only paid $3.60 for this book, and I'm mad...I'm glad that I didn't pay more!!!<br /><br />  There are a few kinds of \\"TV-tie-ins\\"...Sometimes, books are written about episodes of shows, sometimes, tangential stories are written that fall 'between the episodes' (further adventures of characters from the TV world [that could, also, be done, after a show ends &lt;though, that often seems to just happen online with \\"fan fiction\\"]), and (to my knowledge) pre-existing stories that were later turned into shows (or movies) are sometimes adapted to reflect the contents of the show.

1934429821|2.0|This review is for the smaller shrunken version of the full size book.  This is, very clearly, a hastily scaled down replica of the large book - which sounds great on the surface - but you can't take a huge book designed for a set size, scale it down and print it with any decent result:  - The introduction type is miniscule.  - Many of the pieces of artwork are scaled down so much that detail is lost.  - The el-cheapo 4-color printing leaves much to be desired. No spot colors anywhere. :(  - Colors are not rich, nor very accurate.  - Dot density of the printing is unbelievably coarse  - Many pages have a clear moire pattern from either poor scanning, production or printing. (or all three)  - Incredibly, registration is very clearly off by up to 2 millimeters in several pages. This might sound like a lot, but it gives the very graphic edges of Charleys work a fuzzy, blurry smudgy edge.  - Binding is cheap  Extremely disappointed in the production & design of this book.  But hey, it's $20 - so you get what you pay for.  If you love Charley's work, but are on a budget - this might do for you.  For a graphic designer with discerning taste and a critical eye - this is just short of a nightmare.

I wasn't expecting too much, as it is the cheapest priced sleeve on Amazon. I figure a sleeve is  sleeve, and I feel that this sleeve provides adequate protection.   I'm not worried about the zippers scratching, there's a quarter of an inch of beveled cushion around the edges, just make sure you have the Kindle all the way in when you close it and you won't have a problem. At first I thought the leather accent made the sleeve look ugly, but I'm use to it now and I found out the leather accent actually provides a really nice grip when holding it.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. It's about $10 less that the other Kindle sleeves and does the exact same thing!

0670022950|4.0|Pinker provides a cautiously optimistic view of the dramatic reduction in violence over the past few centuries. He has tied together a wide variety of violent behavior (from genocide to cruelty to animals) into one broad pattern of people becoming more civilized.<br /><br />He mostly covers the west, and I wished for more about the trends in the mideast and the more peaceful parts of asia. And why does he avoid commenting on the reported homicide rate for Somalia that's less than the US - does he have reject the data as inaccurate, or does he want to ignore evidence that's inconsistent with his claim that the rise of leviathan reduced crime?<br /><br />The substance of the book is less reassuring than a casual glance would suggest. In particular, the section on the power law distribution of war deaths shows that the model he uses says the expected number of war deaths is infinite, apparently due to small probabilities of really destructive wars. It's easy to overlook this disturbing implication if you aren't reading carefully. I'm disappointed that Pinker didn't talk about this more - how is it altered if we try to incorporate the finiteness of the available population? Should we focus a lot of our attention on avoiding unlikely megawars?<br /><br />He cautiously speculates about possible causes (increased global communications, trade, democracy, self-control, reason, feminization, education, and intelligence via the Flynn effect).<br /><br />If you're an ideologue looking for an excuse to be offended, you're fairly sure to find one in this book.<br /><br />Pinker exaggerates the evidence for violence among hunter-gatherers (see the book Sex at Dawn for the other side of this debate). And the evidence Pinker does present is quite consistent with the hypothesis that violence increased when people switched from hunter-gatherers to stationary farmers.<br /><br />The book is very long, and that's not due to a simple desire to be thorough. Much of the evidence seems selected more for vividness and memorability (e.g. his evidence from fairy tales - not completely frivolous, but insignificant enough evidence that he wouldn't have put it in a peer-reviewed article).<br /><br />I didn't learn enough from it to justify the time spent, but the ideas in it deserve to be known more widely.from fairy tales - not completely frivolous, but insignificant enough evidence that he wouldn't have put it in a peer-reviewed article).

B006671NPM|5.0|It was filmed in 3D, so I'm not sure why it would require 2D to 3D conversion. This is not any clash of the titans where the 3D is only in the credits. The 3D in this case is throughout the entire movie and really adds to the movie. This is not a movie about throwing stuff at the audience to showoff the 3D effects. It does not need that, it is a great story. There are plenty of other cheesy 3D movies, if that is what you are looking for though. The 3D Blu-ray version is a BestBuy exclusive, so that's probably the best place to get it cheap.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a young fan of dystopian, meaning I have only read 3 dystopians, I am still hesitant to read the genre, even though I have loved each and everyone I have read.  After the hype died down for this series, I decided it was time for me to bite the bullet and try out the first in the series.  So thankful I did!<br /><br />A story that centers around a young girl who is thrown into a do or die situation that is televised around her country.  She encounters love, evil and is torn between fighting for what is right and saving one's own self.  I was enveloped into a new world that was easily explained.  It was interesting to read about this made up country and find the similarities in the country we are currently living in.<br /><br />With the movie on its way to theaters, I was torn as to knowing who they had cast for the characters and visualizing them myself.  I did cheat a little and check out the main characters and I guess I can't give an unbiased opinion about the cast because I read the book with the cast already in my mind, so they work for me!<br /><br />A story that you just can't put down once you are half way through because you must see it to the bitter end.  I will be definitely picking up the next two in this series to see where Katniss ends up and where this country goes from here.  I would recommend this book to those who haven't read a dystopian for a little glimpse into the genre and to those who are definite dystopian fans.
B0019NB9A2|4.0|This review is about is about the Blu-ray transfer, not the movie itself which I love.  Overall the transfer looks nice, the only thing I take issue with is that when they do the fades and dissolves between scenes.  Whenever that happens all the effects they have used to enhance the original film disappear and you are left viewing the original source film, which I found jarring and decreased the enjoyment of the viewing experience.  It looks like they put this through a computer on cruse control but it couldn't deal with the fading out, so it just doesn't apply any processing.  Anyway, it's still a large improvement over my old DVD.
1451648537|5.0|I was not an Apple fan until I bought my first iPod in 2007. However - this is the best book I have ever read. Walter Isaacson got it so right. What a thrill it must have been to be on the inside of this amazing human being. I cried the last 50 pages...knowing the end and that he is really gone was more than I could stand. What an amazing person. READ this book!!!!
B005PTQPU0|5.0|A mesmerizing and masterful piece of work!  It quickly became one of my favorite releases of the year.  This is the album Tori Amos tried to make.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Great movie with an unexpected ending.  The movie was enjoyed by men and women.  I would order another movie similar to this one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have no complaints. I am enjoying this game a lot.<br />Unlike most other apps that put a lot of games and skip on quality, this one does one game very well.
0446547654|5.0|November has been a month of reading for me. So, I had enough time in my hands today to spend on this story. But I started it late at night with the intention of reading three or four chapters before falling asleep. But I was wrong. Nicholas Sparks sucked me in from that first chapter. The story is deep, gripping and wide in scope, drawing from mind-blowing dimensions. The Best of Me, and Disciples of Fortune are my favorite reads of this month. The unique style of the writing is unusual, the setting is great and the unique style of writing is an added attraction too. It makes the blood run hot and cold in turns.
B0001I561E|2.0|I'm really disgusted by Disney's 2-disc Platinum Edition DVDs, a line in which they manage to butcher every last one of my favorite classic Disney films with all sorts of unnecessary \\"improvements\\" that, quite frankly, give me the urge to run into every department store I can find and start tearing them off the shelves to make a bonfire in the parking lot out of protest.<br /><br />First, I had to cancel and return two orders of The Lion King because I found out they featured a really stupid deleted song called \\"The Morning Report\\" that made my soul die when I first heard it, and now they have JESSICA SIMPSON AND NICK LACHEY singing \\"A Whole New World\\" with another precious deleted song they just HAD to put in sung by Clay Aiken?!<br /><br />I'm sorry. I don't want \\"new and improved\\", I want the classic versions of the films I grew up with. Why is that too much to ask for?<br /><br />Disney has a huge stick up their behinds when it comes to the matter of making their classic animated films available on DVD. It's not enough that they practice moratorium, oh no. When we get lucky enough that they actually do release them, they have to make all these stupid cringe-worthy \\"improvements\\" that leave a really bad taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Wise up, Disney! WE WANT THE CLASSICS, not your improved products! I finally was able to purchase a 1-disc DVD edition of The Lion King recently that actually (holy crap!) had the full movie in beautiful clarity WITHOUT any glaring changes!!<br /><br />The bad thing? Even THAT is limited edition, so get it while you can!<br /><br />Disney disgusts me more and more as time goes on. My suggestion is to do some research and read through a lot of reviews before purchasing this product, because 9 times out of 10, it is NOT the original.<br /><br />Unless the little things don't bother you as much as they bother me, STAY AWAY FROM DISNEY'S 2-DISC PLATINUM LINE!!
B005HSL626|5.0|its a really addicting game.its always been in the top ten.its free.to enjoy it even more just have wifi but turn off your Internet for no popups or ads. that's all you have to do so now that you know you don't need to send anymore of those horrible pop up comments hope you enjoy the game-  SaDe :)

B006D9EJ3Q|5.0|There are many layers and points of entry to this episode and it's all thanks to those first deceptively clumsy episodes. This early in the series I'm already arguing with myself about the motivations of the characters, the nature of the supernatural aspects and the possible directions the show could take. Also, the final scenes in this episode mirror something I recently experienced in my own life (not anything supernatural) and the portrayal is naturalistic enough to bring me to tears. Yes, I cried - stop making fun of me. Anyway, I'm shocked at how much I'm growing to like this show and how, when the closing credits begin to roll, I get excited about the chance to see another episode.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love this app. Can't remember how I typed without it. Predictions are almost spot on, and I love that it keeps track of your stats. Definitely speeds up typing.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|I gave this movie a go for one reason - Momoa. He's a perfect tough-guy and he's sexier than any one human should be. It turns out, though, that this film is watchable only because of another of his traits: charisma (which is a part of his sexiness, most likely). This movie wanders around with Conan whose principal goal is clear while his methods for achieving it are not. There's none of that pathos/ethos stuff with any of the characters so that people appear to be fighting each other just to keep from being bored. Sure, you witness Conan's loss when he is a brave child warrior, a loss that is grotesque and powerful, but it doesn't really seem to build his character as much as validate it. Even action movies, I expect a little character development. I certain can't do without a plot. This is the sort of movie that should have been formulaic yet satisfying and, instead, was more like a promotional entry into Mr. Momoa's portfolio. As that, though, I can accept the film because I hope to see much more of him.
B005V20JKI|4.0|i have this game on kindle fire, and it is really, really fun, but there are many issues. for one, the screen keeps flip flopping. very annoying. and it is very laggy, and freezes a lot. but the lag is generally only JUST when you launch it everytime.

B005SAP45I|1.0|This is a hollywood left wing enviro movie.  It was a huge disappointment for me and my wife, the kids certainly were not as entertained as they were with the original Cars.  These wizards of smart should keep politics out of making family movies.  Tedious and boring.
B005V20JKI|1.0|This game does not work on my Droid 1.  I can start the game and see the main menu, but trying to start the first level kicks me back out of the program.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|Children will probably like this movie a lot more then most adults. Also I agree with other reviewers that a number of scenes are so dark that you can't see what the actors are seeing. I could say a lot more, but just as my title to this review states \\"Worth watching once\\" I would rather spend that time watching a better movie
1423140591|5.0|Percy Jackson is back! Now 16, he has awakened with amnesia from a long sleep. He knows his name and that he's the demigod son of Poseidon, and has vague memories of someone named Annabeth, but that's all. After being cared for by some wolves, he makes his way to the Roman demigod camp, Camp Jupiter, in the Berkeley-Oakland hills. The camp used to be in San Francisco, until the 1906 earthquake. To the Roman demigods, Percy is the son of Neptune, and they are wary of him, since Neptune is believed to have caused that catastrophic quake.<br /><br />Accompanied by a daughter of Pluto and a son of Mars who also has Chinese and Argonaut ancestors, Percy embarks on a perilous quest to Alaska, to release Thanatos, or Death, from imprisonment so monsters won't keep coming back to life after they're slain, with stops in Portland to obtain information from the blind seer Phineas and in Seattle to get help from Queen Hylla of the Amazons.<br /><br />Not only is the tale of this quest a thrilling story of action and adventure, alternately narrated by the three teenage protagonists; it's also extremely funny. Rick Riordan has a wonderful sense of humor. I could hardly stop laughing during the chapters set in Seattle, where the trio finds out that the Amazons hang out in, yes, the real-world Amazon headquarters. Great fun! The dialogue is witty; the characters are fascinating and likable. This is my favorite so far of all the Percy Jackson books, and I'll be eagerly awaiting the next one.
1439153663|4.0|Lavinia is born into poverty overseas.  Her parents decide to immigrate to America as indentured servants along with Lavinia and her brother.  On the trip over, the parents become ill and both die.  When the ship reaches America, the captain sells the brother's contract, but Lavinia is only seven and won't fetch much.  The captain decides to keep her contract himself and takes her to his plantation.<br /><br />There Lavinia, who is white, is sent to the kitchen house to live among the slaves and learn their trades.  This is fairly scandalous, but the Captain's family is not usual.  Belle, who runs the kitchen house is the Captain's daughter from a liaison with a slave woman.  The Captain's wife spends her days drugged up on laudanum, a form of morphine.  She has been driven mad by the loss of her babies, a common occurrence in this time period.<br /><br />Lavinia learns to love the slaves she grows up among.  They are the only family she knows and she calls the mother and father of the house slaves Mama and Papa the same as her playmates do.  When Lavinia is twelve, the mistress' sister comes on a family visit when the Captain dies.  She is shocked at Lavinia's situation and when the family decides to take the mistress back with them to Williamsburg, they also take Lavinia.  There she grows into a woman, beautiful and determined to return somehow to the plantation and the only family she has ever known.<br /><br />Grissom has written a story of slavery from an interesting angle, that of an indentured white servant who grows up with a slave family.  It allows her to show the plight of the slaves from a different viewpoint, along with the strong sense of family they hold, and the mechanisms they create in order to survive and thrive.  This book is recommended for readers of historical fiction.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Problem #1: Consumes about 40 to 70 mb of memory. Too much for phones with limited memory. On HTC phones this app will cause sense to restart often due to high memory usage. This app needs a low memory footprint option in a bad way.   Problem #2: Buggy and slow. Oftentimes I will be typing in a word, and then it will freeze for several seconds as it looks for a prediction. Sitting there and oftentimes having to wait to start typing again is painful. Also, sometimes when it freezes and you press a key while it is frozen, it will erase your previous word and replace it with the letters you typed while it was frozen. And then after that, when you back out of a program having to see Sense restart because SwiftKey X is hogging 1/3 of your available memory... ay yay yay.  Problem #3: Sketchy developers. The original SwiftKey was free app of the day on amazon.com a while back ago. Then, the following month lo-and-behold there's a new version of the program you have to pay for. Bought it and found out it was pretty much the same thing, they just changed the name of the program and the memory requirements increased 10-fold. Oh, they added a heatmap... oh whoopie doo! I felt stooped. SwiftKey X is more like an update to SwiftKey, rather than a new program. I paid for something that is even worse than the original!  Despite these problems... SwiftKey is the best keyboard on the market sadly.
0446556750|4.0|Twenty-four years ago Jason Jessup killed a twelve-year-old girl.  He has been in prison since then, but now due to DNA testing of a stain on the girl's dress, his conviction has been reversed.  But LA County is not ready to release him; they firmly believe he committed the crime.They decide to retry Jessup, a move that hold the potential for big political payoff or blame.<br /><br />To shield the DA's office, he recruits a strange choice as Special Prosecutor.  Micky Haller is one of the premier defense attorneys in the area.  The DA asks him to take over the case, and explains why the DA's office believes the DNA results make no difference to the truth of the case; that Jessup snuffed out the life of an innocent girl twenty-four years before and needs to stay in prison to protect others.<br /><br />Haller decides to take on the case, both as a curiosity and because, as a father of a daughter the same age as the victim, he believes in what the prosecution is attempting to do.  To make up his team, he recruits his ex-wife, an assistant DA, and his half-brother, Harry Bosch.  Bosch is an LA police detective, assigned to homicide for years and one of the very best.  Together the team works to accomplish the impossible--reversing the reversal.<br /><br />Fans of Michael Connelly will be delighted to see two of his most memorable characters, Haller and Bosch, brought together in a case.  The reader gets an inside look at how prosecutions happen, and the police work behind them that support the evidence.  The plot is fast-paced, and the reader cares about the characters.  This book is recommended for mystery lovers.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I use this app on my evo. I got it for my kindle fire. Fortunately, another reviewer said that you have to put it in landscape mode to load your messages. I initially thought it didn't work for the fire. works fine now.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|you may be MUSICALLY ILLITERATE. I can't believe all the negative reviews of this. People who know NOTHING about music are coming out of the woodwork to give this a negative review. What if Steven King collaborated with someone like William Burroughs, James Joyce or Dostoyevsky? Would you give that one star because you didn't understand all of it? And I'm not trying to put down Stephen King, or trying to say Metallica is a pulp fiction band! He's a great writer and they're a great band. But music, like writing, shouldn't be defined by narrow minded, unintelligent, myopic, and deaf ears. People, try digging the music for what it is; a great metal band collaborating with one of the worlds' greatest and gifted musicians to ever walk the planet. Ever. Try listening to music of another genre besides metal. Dig into jazz, classical, post punk, experimental, ambient, R&B, rap (there's some poetry for ya), etc, and see if you can find where Lulu is coming from. It's not a (metal) vacuum. There's a musical history behind it. I could name names, but what's the point? They would fall on deaf ears. People who really know music know what I'm talking about. Anyway, I happen to really like Lulu. It's all in there. And outside as well. Kudos to Metallica for doing something \\"different.\\" Lou, you rock as always.
B005V20JKI|3.0|First time I opened the app it wouldn't respond and had to force close. Opening it a second time it worked fine. The issue I notice is the screen keeps rotating in between levels. I hold the device the same way I was through the level and as soon as you go to upgrade characters or do anything, the screen randomly flips upside down. Thankfully it doesn't do this while you're actually trying to play the game. I don't see any issue with the permission requirements that everyone is complaining about. if you don't like them don't install. My guess it that it's just trying to determine what's running and make sure nothing will conflict with the game.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|The original, simply the best.  Cher has been the backdrop to my life, the dream, the alter ego, the words and music behind thoughts emotions and events.  One amazing woman, one amazing career.  Surely there is a place in heaven (none too soon mind you) for the one who has touched so many in very positive ways.  Thank you!
B001TH7GT6|5.0|These cables seem to be very solid and well-built.  What I really like is how easy it is to use them for different applications. There are three prongs at each end, but you can easily convert it to a two-prong plug (for audio stereo), or a single-prong plug (for a subwoofer).  All you have to do is essentially pull the cables apart. So with three of these, I was able to connect a whole bunch of different equipment, and the price was great.  I thought the six foot length might be excessive, but it turned out to be just right.  I highly recommend.
B0037KMHRY|1.0|Great music, probably some of the best I've heard in along time, but what good is it if it will only play in my PC?  There are no readable music files on this disk, so if you want to use it in your MP3 player or some other device, your're screwed, almost.  If you have ITunes (you download it for free) you can load the music in to that, then copy the file over to a windows folder, which should convert them to .MP4.  Dragging them from there to my MP3 player automatically converted them to .WMA, which I then converted to MP3 using GoldWave.  Stupid waste of time in order to listen to music that I purchased legally. Idiots, this is why people pirate music....<br />Could have just downloaded the MP3s directly, but this was a birthday gift.  Given that option, why did Disney even bother with the DRM?<br /><br />PS Mickey Mouse sux
0316056863|3.0|It was funny collection of short essays.  She is a strong woman who doesn't like the fact that she's a woman being pointed out at work at least. After reading this book I admire her and how she juggles work and a family like any man does.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies i own, the whole movie is well put together and has such cute parts, some really funny parts, and some emotional parts. I love this movie so much and would recommend this movie to all my friends, family and all the strangers i meet. This movie is truly great.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|This is one of my absolute favorite apps for my iphone. This version, however, is lacking. The feeds are terrible and the bugs are annoying. The record feature is all mssed up. Cant set end time? WTF? Glad I paid for this version when the free version is just as good. Its not worth your money if you're on a kindle fire. Just get the free app. I just got ripped off.
B005ZCXFD2|5.0|The preview made it easy for me to part with the 99 cents to rent this film. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as it had me screaming and laughing. The film moved at a good pace. The kids in this film were tough to say the least.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I really do not know what it is about this particular version of Pride & Prejudice that I love so much but I will say it is wonderful and at this price how could you go wrong?!
B000O1799U|5.0|Interestingly I've found myself watching this over & over. It's not only entertaining, but tells great stories within the movie itself. Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy)starts out strong, but the drugs & women are his ruin. Eddie Murphy gives us an all star montage of his singing abilities which surprised me to say the least.<br />Deanna(Beyonce) coming into her own finally as her character learns the truth of her girl group finally. Hell hath no fury like a pissed off woman & when she sings her song \\"Listen\\" you truly feel her pain & coming to terms with her life in the film.<br />The payola story is right from the pages of history.This film explores so many things that make music what it was during the era it takes place. Each persons storyline adds another element. You feel what they feel & end up wondering how so much went wrong before it all came to a head.<br />Well worth watching & owning & some of the music is pretty cool too! A fun film, but it carries its messages well.
B002ZG983M|5.0|Masterfully realizes (and exceeds) the comics book it is based on. Escalating, outrageous violence. Cathartic humor. Characters with enough of a footing in reality that we buy into their world. One of the best Nicholas Cage roles in a long time and Chloë Grace Moretz is, of course, stupendous. This equals Watchmen as a faithful adaptation and probably surpasses it in succeeding on it's own (of course it's a much simpler story).
B0058VW36U|5.0|Looks good, works great on Kindle Fire! I prefer it to Angry Birds ... Total bargain for a fun, fun game!
B003UYV08E|4.0|Pretty darn good. Functions reasonably well as a stand alone film. Functions very well as a continuation of the build toward the Avengers movie. Avoids the trap of multiplying villains with each sequel. Continues adding depth (though not tremendous depth) to all of the characters. Jon Favreau accomplishes a difficult and thankless task with style and aplomb in continuing this franchise. And I admire his geek-knowledge foresight in giving himself a tiny part in IM1 as the character who eventually marries Gwyneth Paltrow's character. Smooth, buddy, smooth.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|A young muppet that grew up idolizing Kermit and the gang visits the old muppet studio with his brother and the brother's girlfriend. They discover a plot to destroy the muppet studio for oil exploration unless $10m can be raised. Kermit and the gang put on a show to raise the money. This is a movie that brings back quite a few memories for the older generations and creates new memories for their kids. Seeing the old characters is quite a treat, and the presence of the talented Amy Adams and Jason Segel are a bonus. There is some very clever humor in this film that adults will appreciate. This is an absolutely delightful movie that everyone will enjoy.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Fine performers chewing the scenery in a beautifully made film that can support those performances. This is a film you have to pay attention to at every moment.

B0037QGS0A|3.0|Atom Egoyan, as usual, examines the human mess inside beautifully sterile, designed environments. This marvelously filmed drama is a more restrained trip through the territory [[ASIN:B000E5N684 Basic Instinct]] plunged through.
B006671NPM|2.0|The movie is amazing. Also the 3D works great. If you are going to buy this item, buy it at the Best Buy store. Best Buy has it for 25 dollars. Also the ultraviolet dvd sucks. Buy this at best buy.
B002ZG4Q5W|4.0|Strikingly beautiful. Outrageously melodramatic. This isn't my favorite Kurosawa, but being less of a Masterpiece than, say, \\"Seven Samurai\\" still makes it more of a Masterpiece than most directors could hope to achieve. And remember; none of those soldiers, horses, clouds, arrows, flames, or sprays of blood are CGI.
B005HSL626|1.0|the game might be fun but I couldn't get past all of the bs ads.  not even worth the trouble.
B001HN694K|2.0|Comme Ci, Comme Ca.  Anne Hathaway casually out-quirkied Johnny Depp, who was mostly retreading and reusing old mannerisms, and Crispin Glover, who was handicapped by his costume. Mia Wasikowska held her own as Alice against the heavyweight stars. Visually; the movie looked good but didn't break any new ground. I was actually most impressed by the slowly growing mushrooms and vines framing the end credits. Lovely.
B004LROUNG|5.0|One of the best of the Grisham books, I loved the character development and I appreciated the realistic personalities and settings. The story moved along at a nice pace, the plot was interesting and the ending was unpredictable.  What a great way to spend a lazy day.

0307891372|5.0|This book I just had to write a review on. I am not a Guide Book guy at all but Skyrim being so vast and such an interesting place I wanted to make sure that I explored it all and at this price it just was too good to pass up.   The detail and passion that went into this guide is remarkable and is seen on every page.  It comes with a very large fold up map  The book is 653 Pages!  Lists all potion combinations.  Lists all Beasts and Creatures (Strengths, Weaknesses, Levels etc)  Has a TON of checklists that one could make their own master check list out of while exploring Skyrim.  And it has every location, dungeon, and point of interest labeled and discussed. I guess one could say its the GPS for Skyrim.   It also has walks-through of each of the quests, each civil war side, each Guild, and main quest.  The towns, the Dragon Language (also converted to english), the song lyrics, 'builds' of certain classes, an atlas of each Hold Territory and much more.  I really like going into a new hold/territory then reading in the book its history and interesting points.  I can see how much work and care went into this little gem, definately worth the purchase.
0446573019|5.0|Best Baldacci novel to date.  David Baldacci's Zero Day is, in my opinion, his best mystery thriller yet--5+ stars.  Great plot, well written, crisp dialog, and a terrific new character in Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) Warrant Officer John Puller--A true individual army of One.  I noticed quite a few reviewers have slammed Mr. Baldacci for stealing Lee Child's mega character Jack Reacher and repackaging him as John Puller.  I strongly disagree!  Jack Reacher is one of my favorite literary characters, and in John Puller Mr. Baldacci has done a terrific job of creating Reacher's literary doppelganger.  I do not view this as literary plagiarism, but rather a selfish opportunity to read twice as many great stories concerning the Reacher/Puller mystique:  How can anyone logically argue with that--in the end is it not all about the story?!  I sincerely hope Mr. Baldacci will write more novels with the John Puller character as this will give ME many MORE hours of enjoyable reading.  Yep, John Puller is similar to several other detective action hero types:  The aforementioned Jack Reacher and of course Paul Brenner of Nelson DeMille literary fame.  In Baldacci's Zero Day we are introduced to John Puller, a highly decorated combat Ranger and tough as nails Army CID Investigator.  He is considered by the Army to be their best criminal investigator.  He is assigned SOLO to investigate the horrific death of a DIA colonel and his family--A most unusual investigative army protocol.  But then this is a most unusual case as Puller soon discovers.  Working with the local female police investigating sergeant, Samantha Cole, soon more deaths occur as the case becomes more and more strange.  Nothing is what it appears on the surface and makes no logical sense.  Puller uses all his investigative wiles and soon he and Sam Cole are on the hunt for the brutal killers.  Terrifically written detective mystery.  Baldacci uses short crisp sentences to drive both the inductive and deductive investigative reasoning used by Warrant Officer Puller.  Like all great detective mysteries, Puller's flawless logic engages the reader as the mystery deepens and unfolds.  Once Baldacci hooks the reader in, which he does very early in the novel, you simply cannot put this book down.  Relatively short chapters help to further quickly develop the story.  Character development was superb.  John Puller is a very complicated  man.  Mr. Baldacci lays enough biographical groundwork concerning Puller's complex past that the reader will quickly grow to appreciate just who John Puller is.  Other characters were also developed as the story warranted.  All in all Mr. Baldacci packed a lot of character development into 435 pages which gave the story solid literary depth.  No gratuitous sex, language, or violence:  A Baldacci trademark.  Like Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, most of Zero Day is a thinking investigative mystery novel interspersed with moments of quick, decisive action.  Puller is a man of great intellect and few words,  But when action is required he is quick to end any physical confrontation on his terms.  I liked this book immensely.  I had almost given up on Mr. Baldacci but this novel shows just what he can really do, and that is write an excellent detective mystery.  Yes I know some do not like the Puller/Reacher similarity, but to the selfish me it just means more good mysteries.  I hope Mr. Baldacci makes the John Puller character into a series as he has a real winner here.  What do you say Mr. Baldacci?  Looking forward to the next John Puller novel??
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Micro offers another compelling, thought provoking, and fast-paced addition to the techno thriller canon. While not the same level of complexity and intensity as Jurassic Park or The Lost World, Micro was an engrossing read and well worth the hardcover price (for easier sharing).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app but the feature that allows you to LISTEN to the bible is fantastic!! The narrator has a pleasant voice too. Absolutely the best Bible app on my tablet
0061122416|4.0|This is a difficult review to write. From the perspective of historical fiction this book is not so much. It's a tale. A thought-provoking tale. The tale taps into the seeker of truth in all of us. I enjoyed contemplating the lessons in this book far more than I enjoyed the simplistic writing style, which was overly and blatantly simplistic, simply not my style, but take that with a grain of sand because I think Rushdie is the bomb (and some would say he writes over the top, and I find myself in awe). But to be fair, I would say that Ken Folet has a simplistic writing style, but his is brilliantly so, in that you don't ever stop to ask yourself how or why he constructed his sentences that way, you just keep following the story, and his stories rock, though I don't remember spending too much time asking myself about the lessons therein. As a novel, I would not rate this book too highly.<br /><br />As a thought-provoking tale, The Alchemist is 5-star. I liked it far better Jonathan Livingston Seagull, which was an interesting concept but not ultimately one I could buy into. Coelho reinforces some the lessons in The Alchemist, or did I just tap into them? For instance, Omens. Following Omens in our respective lives, good Omens, that is, while steering away from bad Omens keeps you on the right path toward a Personal Legend, or having the best possible life and being content with that. The Universe conspires to give you what is your destiny (my own wording on what I think one of the lessons might be), or that you stay on the path of the Will of God (not a phrase used in the book, but my own interpretation). I believe this and actually plan to TRY and follow good Omens a little more mindfully, when I recognize them. Lots of nuggets of wisdom and just plain good advice. There's a very interesting ending, one I did not expect. The protagonist in the story is seeking a treasure which is buried near the pyramids. You definitely anticipate him finding that treasure. I was not at all disappointed with the outcome of that thread, and indeed thought it brilliant.<br /><br />I loved this book when I was able to categorize it as a tale rather than a novel.sappointed with the outcome of that thread, and indeed thought it brilliant.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|From my neanderthal pespective, I attentively watched this movie and felt \\"much ado about nothing\\".<br /><br />I was expecting more because of the ridiculous hype of this movie. What I have learned is that intense director, Darren Aronofsky, makes little, indie-resembling personal movies and then they get widespread acclaim ( I also thought \\"The Wrestler\\" was overrated). This was a passable piece of eccentric entertainment yet the premise of the story was not that compelling. The simple premise can almost be adapted into a play.<br /><br />Natalie Portman plays a [way over dedicated] ballerina where she has the talent to portray the angelic aspect of the role in \\"Swan Lake\\" but is missing the \\"soul\\" to play the emotional aspect of the role. Her overbearing mother, Barbera Hershey completely embarrassing herself playing a modern day Piper Laurie's charactor from \\"Carrie\\", developing rival, Mila Kunis, and passionate/perverted director all pull on her as she unravels.<br /><br />Portman's performance is interesting...if I was a 12 year old girl. The interaction is too catty for a viewer that doesn't understand the nuances of ballet to have empathy towards what is going on. This in ot only a \\"chick\\" flick but a \\"chick flick\\" for a drama queen.
1419702238|5.0|I bought this book before checking out the reviews. I finally checked them out before I had the chance to read it, and I felt some concern over the direction other readers claimed the series was taking.   Well, I've finally found the time to read through it.   Let me start off by saying this one is definitely my favorite from the series! Kinney has managed to write a book that is both appealing to children and entertaining to adults. The book was hilarious and had me laughing out loud at quite a few moments. Greg was enjoyable, too. (he wasn't as big of a jerk as he is in the other books, but he still felt Greg-like to me.)  My favorite part of the book was his addiction to a certain online pet game. I happen to work for a company that created such a game, so it was amusing to hear Greg's thoughts on the subject.  I thought about going over the issues other reviewers had with the series, because I have a good idea of why Kinney might've done what he did, but instead I'll say that his writing has not gone flat, that his jokes have not gone stale, and that the series has not gone downhill.  So readers: keep reading!
0596009208|2.0|If you've ever learned a musical instrument, you know it's a lot easier to learn using songs and repertoire you're familiar with.  You know what it's supposed to sound like, you know how to correct yourself when you make a mistake, and you have a nice feeling of satisfaction when you're playing the final song.  This book has very few coding exercises, and those that it does have make absolutely no sense.  Almost everyone is familiar with the classic game Battleship where you can sink carriers and submarines.  But this book has you write something where you sink \\"dot coms.\\"  The result is you get objects like \\"dotComsToTest\\" and \\"dotComsList\\" instead of simply \\"carrier\\" and \\"battleship.\\"  Learning Java is confusing enough without incorporating this type of \\"creativity\\"!  Later on in the book, you attempt an exercise where classes are Nose(), Clowns(), Picasso(), and Of76().  Maybe I'm missing something here, but how the heck do any of these relate to each other!  Very disappointing purchase.

1451627289|4.0|I will write a complete review when I finish this book, which I am about halfway through at the moment. It is a compelling work so far, but I found one item Mr. King missed in his research. He has a character in the book using the phrase, \\"Don't mess with Texas\\" circa 1960. This phrase was a slogan developed for an anti-littering campaign in 1985 for the Texas Department of Transportation. Oooops!  AFTER FINISHING THE BOOK  I spent most of today reading the last half of Stephen King's \\"11/22/63\\". It captured my interest on many levels...time travel, alternate history, and paradoxes from tampering with the past. Part Quantum Leap (setting right what once went wrong), part Somewhere In Time (romance with a woman from a previous era), part Sliders (alternate realities), and lots of historic detail make it a compelling read, even at 849 pages. It also highlights just how different our world is from the one of my childhood. I highly recommend this one.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I bought this to replace the stock HSF on the AMD Phenom II x6 1100T CPU, which though gets the job done, is very noisy.  The stock AMD fan goes up to around 6000rpm, but anything over 3500rpm was noisy to my ears.  According to AMD, the max operating temperature for the 1100T is 62C, but I've noticed that on hot days (80F+ ambient) the CPU would actually exceed this temperature a bit when running Prime95...  So I decided to get a better HSF.  After reading some reviews, I decided to get this.  It's quite a bit bigger than the stock AMD HSF.  There's about 1cm of space clearance between my low-profile memory modules and the HSF, though there's just a few millimeters of clearance from the top of the heatsink to the case (side door) of my Cooler Master Elite 430 case.  The CM Elite 430 case has a cut-out, so I didn't need to remove my motherboard to install the retention plate, which would have taken quite a lot more time instead of just a few minutes.  The HSF comes with one CM Blade Master fan that operates in the roughly 500~2000rpm range.  The fan is quite a bit quieter than the stock AMD fan, even at the max 2000rpm speed.  CM includes the mounting hardware for a second fan, should you choose to install a second fan for a push-pull configuration.  My case fans are already close to the exhaust side of the heatsink, so I didn't bother with adding another fan.  The retention clip allows the HSF to be mounted in either the horizontal or vertical positions.  As for temperatures, my CPU now goes up to ~55C in running Prime95 in room temperatures of 80F+, so roughly a 10C drop compared to the stock HSF...and quite a bit quieter.

B0054LVP3Q|4.0|Really, really enjoyed this one even though suspense/thrillers aren't my usual genre. The premise here reminds me of the movie 50 First Dates -girl wakes up each morning with no memories of the previous day(s) and essentially relives each new day as her first, being told about her accident and looking at photographs of her missing life. This isn't a comedy though. The story here is dark and mysterious, with an impending sense of everyone/everything is not as it seems. As the reader you have the task of trying to figure it out who the bad guy is, who's lying to Christine and why. I didn't figure that out or see the big twist coming until I was right on top of it, so this was a super fun read for me.<br /><br />At times the story does get repetitive because we're continually in Christine's head, being retold or reading and relearning everything from her journal over and over again. By the same token the first person narrative also got to be a bit much but really this couldn't have been written any other way.<br /><br />We begin with Christine waking up in a stranger's bed. She can't remember how she got there but her twenty-something self tells her that she must have hooked up with the man at a party. Christine is not hung over though and soon learns that she's no longer in twenties either but from the same decade as the middle aged man washing up in the bathroom. And now he's telling her that he's her husband Ben, and that she suffered a devastating injury resulting in a rare form of amnesia, leaving her unable to retain memories from one day to the next.<br /><br />Left alone Christine begins to putter about the house, what does she do all day anyways? Does it matter? She soon receives a phone call from a man claiming to be her Doctor; he explains that she has been keeping a journal and where it is hidden. It is through this journal that Christine begins to piece her life back together, forming a fragmented picture from those she is supposed to trust. But not everything adds up and as the days go by and the journal entries get longer Christine realizes that she is receiving two different versions of her life from her Doctor and her husband.<br /><br />Relying completely on the journal Christine begins testing her husband and finally doubting herself as confusing memories return. Are they real? When the last day's journal entry reads \\"Don't trust Ben\\" who will she turn to? What is the truth?<br /><br />I found this scary and sad in the sense that Christine has lost 20 years of her life. Imagine being in college and waking up at 45! Repeating the same day over and over, not knowing what is real, just relying on those you think you can trust. Realizing that you've probably been having the same conversations, asking the same questions and being told the same horrible truths (lies) every day.<br /><br />This was a great read, it's not perfect but made me stop and think. It has also been optioned for film by Ridley Scott's production company.

B005UA0FLE|4.0|Michael Bubl&eacute;'s first Christmas album perfectly titled \\"Christmas\\" is a collection of holiday favorites that may touch the hearts of Bubl&eacute; fans and holiday music listeners.  The album contains a set of songs that range from the most recent contemporary to the most memorable past.  Like most Christmas albums, any collection would not have that holiday sound without the quintessential favorites, \\"Jingle Bells,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" and \\"Silent Night.\\" But what differs from versions of the past to Bubl&eacute;'s renderings?  He adds a bit of today's standard rhythm with duets and vocal accompaniments by Shania Twain and the Puppini Sisters.<br /><br />All of the songs on the record have a quality that shows Bubl&eacute;'s distinct vocal traits.  Several of the highlights of the album include the entertaining version of \\"Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad\\" that Bubl&eacute; sings with Thalia, \\"Holly Jolly Christmas,\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\"  For listeners accustomed to Mariah Carey's \\"All I Want for Christmas is You,\\" Bubl&eacute; also does a rendition of the song, however, a slightly slower tempo version that may have listeners preferring the former.  And after listening to the entire album, there may be more favorites that listeners may find to their interest.<br /><br />As note, Bubl&eacute; released a six song EP several years ago called \\"[[ASIN:B000VE4DPS Let It Snow]]\\" that contained the title track as a live and studio version along with three of the songs that he reprises on \\"Christmas.\\"  If listeners are looking for an additional set of songs by Bubl&eacute;, I highly recommend the EP.  His version of \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" and \\"White Christmas\\" have a much more jazz and tender quality to each of these standard Christmas melodies that exceptionally spotlight his vocals.
B005TQACLC|5.0|Just watched the entire Blu-ray from start to finish. A-MA-ZING! Britney worked it! I saw The Femme Fatale Tour live twice and actually met Britney in Zagreb (flew all the way from Helsinki for that) and she was really sweet. You can tell that she really loves what she does. Back during the Onyx Hotel Tour you could tell by watching her performances that she was pretty much over it. Even though she was technically on point, delivering some of the best dance moves in the industry, looking at her eyes it felt like someone was forcing her to tour and she just wanted to stop. Not anymore. On this tour she looks so much more alive and in the moment. She's having fun with the crowd and the performances. She's full of energy and spirit. It felt like watching the Britney at the starting point of her career again.<br /><br />The tour itself was very well directed. The costumes were great and the set list is packed with hits. I can't pick a favorite performance because they're all really essential. Sure there were some stand out moments but the show wouldn't work without those less elaborate moments either.<br /><br />The video quality is top notch. I did see some weird jagged lines in some scenes but they didn't really bother me. The only complain I have about the video is that they did a poor job hiding the fact that they used footage from two nights on this release. Her hair looked different and the editing team didn't really seem to care at all. Also the lighting was different on these two nights. The first night's lighting was way too bright and it made her look pale and her hair looked like it was drenched in sweat. They seemed to have fixed the problem on the second night and she looked a lot more camera friendly. So seeing these two footage being switched around back and forth in one song was kinda annoying.<br /><br />The audio quality is great, I really like that they didn't drown it with audience noises. Most of the concert was dubbed with album vocals which really pissed me off at first but I'm kinda getting used to it now. I found a little \\"easter egg\\" with the audio: during \\"...Baby One More Time\\" if you listen to the LPCM track you'll hear the album vocals but if you switch to the DD 5.1 track you'll hear the live (well, pre-recorded) vocals. I thought that was kinda neat seeing that we only got the dubbed vocals during the Epix broadcast.m kinda getting used to it now.

B004ZNAGNE|5.0|I'll go along with most other reviewers here and say the re-re-remastered studio disc sounds just fine, but not really any different than the other remasters I've purchased over the years. HOWEVER: the second disc of a 1974 live performance of the album is THE disc I've been wanting and waiting for all these years. Never mind the 1994 live recording called Pulse by a band that called itself \\"Pink Floyd\\". That was a band comprised of David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Nick Mason...and about fifty extra session musicians. And no Roger Waters. This collection of musicians did a passable rendition of Dark Side, but it wasn't the band that had recorded Rock's Great Masterpiece back in 1973. And now we finally have the Real Pink Floyd and just Pink Floyd - David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Nick Mason - in an absolutely excellent live performance of Dark Side. The mix is fantastic, the sound is crystal clear. Roger Waters' bass playing is fantastic. Just the four of them sound WAY much more authentic than the Pulse mega-band. Definitely worth the price!
B005J4TLN4|4.0|Months later, my first vivid memory when someone mentions ATTACK THE BLOCK is of how it generated more good buzz than COWBOYS & ALIENS, another sci-fi feature which shared the same box office debut date, stateside (July 29, 2011). Except that COWBOYS & ALIENS lacked what ATTACK THE BLOCK brought to the table: a certain vitality, a sense of suspense, and an exuberant young cast that's years away from being jaded. So, yeah, if you're expecting loads of Nick Frost in this picture, be aware now that he's in only for several cameo appearances, what amounts to pretty much a supporting role. And, word to the wise, unlike previous films featuring Nick Frost, this one isn't a spoofy film. Or not blatantly anyway. Director Joe Cornish opts for a more straight-up sci-fi action thriller. With good bits of comedy. But characters fall victim to alien predations and there are moments of icky blood-letting and gore. Which to me are strong selling points.<br /><br />ATTACK THE BLOCK pits a crew of teenaged hoods against a localized alien invasion. The film's skimpy budget couldn't at all afford epic. In South London, on Guy Fawkes Night, as lights and sparklers festoon the atmosphere, Moses and and his street gang go about the business of mischief. A nurse named Sam (Jodie Whittaker), who lives in the neighborhood, is their latest victim, to the tune of a mugging. But then a meteorite hurtles down to earth, smashing onto a nearby automobile and so Sam, she makes her getaway.<br /><br />I guess you can blame the ringleader Moses (John Boyega, memorable). Moses is stoic and intense and not afraid to take matters into his own hands. He ends up offing an extraterrestrial - because in sci-fi films, chances are good that meteorites are actually vehicles for space aliens. Moses's action ushers in the plummeting of more meteorites, and true to sci-fi trope, more alien creatures emerge, this time a pack of jet black, furry monsters. These predatory things, exhibiting cruel bioluminescent fangs and an aura of sheer menace, evince a marked lacked of intelligence, as demonstrated by one creature's sheer inability to open a friggin' dumpster. It's actually rather sweet that our \\"heroes,\\" witnessing these meteorites descending onto their South London housing projects, get all excited about killing off more aliens.<br /><br />Director Joe Cornish purposely introduces these disenfranchised inner city youths to look as threatening as possible. The kids are fully hooded up and masked, silhouetted in shadow, ominous. Every suburban yuppie's nightmare. As the story progresses, we see the kids remove their layers, and we get a peek into their personalities and individual ticks. It's nothing new, but Cornish frames these characters really well and the kid actors are lively and likable, once the masks come off. And when the chips are down, they don't hesitate to stand together, to protect their block. And they go about this armed with baseball bats and samurai swords and near-cryptic South London slang. Doesn't anyone just say \\"Crikey!\\" anymore?<br /><br />COWBOYS & ALIENS, with its mega-budget, doesn't come close to being as watchable as ATTACK THE BLOCK which goes to show that, sometimes, you really hone in on what's important when limited to meager resources. The film makes do with generous application of practical effects and by opting for a big bad alien that's conducive to cutting cost. And, yeah, the film could've been funnier. It could've been scarier. But this film didn't intend to be another SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's its own entity and comes with its own sense of dynamism. Cornish infuses the screen with smarts and heart and lots of energy, abetted by cinematographer Thomas Townend's vivid imagery and Basement Jaxx's throbbing score. And the kids, again, lend their own vibrancy and great enthusiasm; their interactions are highlight scenes for me. This is some refreshing take on ye olde space alien invasion, with attitude to burn and urban jungle ethics and braggadocio on full exhibit.

1451648537|2.0|I think the author was so caught up in trying to make a 'fair and balanced' portrait of Steve that he really missed the focus on getting the essence of his brilliance and what made him a 'genius'.  Much of the 1st half the book doesn't provide any new insight more than what has already been published and doesn't go into real depth into this own thought process.  Maybe I was expecting too much in that I had expected this to be a master piece, something that would articulate the brilliance and thought process of a man who has shaped and touched our world.  It just reads like a time line of events and I had to force myself to read it to the end, hoping that there would be something of Steve's real thoughts...the closest we come to this is, 'I could have handle that better..'or'he (Steve) seems resigned'. I wanted to have his words or his thoughts; if you just compare this to I,Woz, you'll get what I mean, the true voice of Steve seems as though it never makes a showing until the very last pages of the book.  I think,it is the conclusion of the book, is where the book really should have started in terms of getting into the true genius and character of Steve; I hope and pray that there is 10x more material that the author picked up so that there can be a book that really flushes this out. Otherwise I feel as though, what an absolutely wasted opportunity.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|I admit: i watched the first spartacus series because i got it for free on amazon vine.  expectations were low.  I was amazingly surprised at how great it was.  When this came out i just had to get it.  Yes, the violence is over the top, cartoony, offensive at times.  but i love how unforgiving it is.  i also love how despicable some of the characters are while still having legitimate motivations for their actions: characters are self interested and controlled by their emotions/desires, but there's a backstory to all of them, and you can't help but feel a little compassion for where they're coming from.  It's decadent, raunchy, funny, sadistic fun!

1597801585|5.0|This is the best science fiction novel that I have read for many years.  It is bleak and depressing, but that is a fair take on how the world is evolving.  It more than matches William Gibson in painting a future world.  The painting is richer, more unrelenting and more vivid.  It stays in one place, without travelling around, and it thus grinds the reader's face further into the dirt with each chapter, until he is suffocating but fascinated.  It has great contemporary relevance, in showing how genetic engineering could destroy civilization.  Never mind how likely this is, it could happen and it makes your flesh crawl.  It is not perfect.  The characters are not all fully developed, and there are one or two redundant plot twists.  The technology context is incomplete - it would spoil the story to say too much but while reading it think about solar energy.  But this is science fiction not futurology.   One of the great contemporary science fiction novels. I await the next one from this author.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|Disregard the 1 & 2 star reviews from the Ritalin generation ( waaahhh...the songs are too long, the songs are too slow, too weird). There's a reason most every major publication that features music reviews have given this album high marks.    The duet w/ Elton John, though not as bad as I'd feared, is one I will mostly be skipping. Though it won't be to a lot of people's liking, I enjoyed the title track and Stephen Frye's contribution. My favorite at the moment is \\"Misty\\".   For the discerning, and those who aren't holding their breath for the next \\"Running Up That Hill\\" or \\"Wuthering Heights\\", there is lots of great music here. I think fans of [[ASIN:B003TTB0DK Aerial]] and [[ASIN:B0000026IP Sensual World]] will love \\"50 Words For Snow\\".
B003UESJIS|4.0|Mike Leigh, in my opinion, is nowadays the most interesting British director working in the U.K. His last movies are without exception of the highest standard. Now [[ASIN:B003UESJIS Another Year (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]] is a film about solitude. Don't be mistaken about it, the main character of this film is not the federative and fusional Tom/Gerry couple but rather Mary whose attempts to be accepted in this idealized family (If I can't marry the son, I'll marry the uncle) are deeply moving. Highly Recommended.

Somber, sweeping songs evoke so many emotions and images as you listen to this CD.<br />This is not something I would put on for a party or festive occasion.<br />Favorite:  Snowed In At Wheeler Street (Elton John guest vocals!)<br />and 50 Words for Snow may just be a new winter anthem - catchy and cool!
B001E45XT4|4.0|For the mostpart, this headset is very nice. It's got a very plastic-like appearance and feel, but it's not cheap by any means. It's easy to adjust and tends to remember its setting, even after removing it multiple times. The padding is also very comfortable, especially around the ears.  Sound quality isn't going to blow you away, but it's passable. My first sound impressions left me desiring more bass, but that was easily solved in about 30 seconds via the Windows Sound Mixer.  I honestly can't speak for the Microphone because I use an external one. My primary desires for this headset were Sound and Comfort, and this device doesn't disappoint on either. I can easily wear these for 8+ hours without feeling any discomfort.  There are certainly better headsets out there, but it's hard to beat this one in terms of value.

1449389627|5.0|This is a brilliant book not because it is enlightening. In fact it is not. The matter of fact is its brilliance is due to the fact that it makes explicit without jargon what could be inferred if one were willing to observe and research patiently.  However, I have learnt something about innovation that is as well a myth.The myth is 'you need MONEY to make innovation'. So many times I have heard this from 'x' sources, [and myself as well :-)] but just a bit of poking around and it turns out to be a myth. What is true is that you need money does not imply you need to 'have' that money!  Having read this book and I learnt about how to investigate a subject in detail from multiple perspectives. Even if you may not agree with (anything) in this book, its worth a read if you just want to know how to analyze a complex subject and represent your understanding.
1451627289|5.0|I was lucky enough to find a book called \\"Carrie\\" in a drugstore before I boarded a bus. Next I found 'Salem's Lot,\\" and my love affair started.<br /><br />But I stopped reading Stephen King's books, after reading \\"It.\\" His books began being published quicker and quicker, and I wasn't impressed with what I had read. But I'm a fan, and always hoping.<br /><br />Many years later, I read \\"Cell,\\" which I severely disliked, and was ready to write off any future Stephen King books.<br /><br />And then I found \\"11/22/63.\\"  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book! It gripped me from the first sentence, and I put aside anything else I might be doing, and just read the book, finishing it in about 3 days.<br /><br />I loved the story, both time-travel, romance, and political intrigue. I couldn't wait to learn how it was going to turn out. How was changing the past going to change the future?<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.  I'm now in an-after book depression, the kind you get when you don't want it to end.<br /><br />One note: I read it on a Kindle. What I dislike about reading it on a Kindle is that the bottom of the page is always letting you what percentage of the book is left to read. Very annoying.<br /><br />Anyway, Stephen King, I'm back, and I'm willing to now read the books I had passed on.<br /><br />Oh, and to anyone who dislikes the length of his books - I want them longer! It was wonderful to realize that I had a long road ahead of me.
0446573019|5.0|Regardless of what some previous reviewers have said, this is not a Jack Reacher novel, its better.  From the first page this story grabs you. Pulled is sensational.  Character building is at it's beat. Puller shows a great investigative style.   As the story unfolds, Puller  an Army brat with some baggage is well respected. He takes no prisoners.. The best thing to do is read the book and enjoy.  As I said before, not a reacher novel.

1451627289|4.0|This is a long, thoughtful novel about the really scary things in life: love, loss, and the passage of time.  If you can suspend disbelief long enough to accept the premise of a door into the past (and of course you can, otherwise you wouldn't be reading a King novel in the first place) then you can move on to the pleasures of this book.  King gives us detailed, believable characters, carefully observed background, and a slow-moving but compelling plot.  This is one of the best-written King books, well-researched and a pleasure to read. Therefore the one major historical error is jarring, but unless you do geneological research, you are not likely to notice it.  So read and enjoy!
B0063IH60K|1.0|Really lame.  There is only one solitaire game - just Klondike - and they couldn't even do that well.  The graphics are very limited.  There are only 3 background choices and no other options to customize the look.  The scoring system makes no sense at all.  I really can't understand why this game is popular.  There are much better games available.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|When describing the album Lungs I think of dark almost gothic undertones and pounding drum beats. That, or you have ethereal and vulnerable moments as you do in the song \\"Cosmic Love\\". Ceremonials is the yang to the yin offering light to whatever haunts you. The two albums are different when it comes to the mood they offer and I can understand why some people might be dissapointed by the lack of \\"shadows\\" in this album. Or the lack of a certain \\"feeling\\" that Lungs genertated. Ceremonials for the most part is uplifting, almost spiritual; in the song \\"Shake it out\\" Florence tells us that its hard to dance with the devil on your back, so shake him off. Some songs have an almost choir like quality with multiple voices for the chorus. What you can expect from Ceremonials is the continued quality of Florence's voice, dramatic instrumentals punctuated by percussion, and that certain magic thats so unique to this artist. I am incredibly partial to the album Lungs and I believe my fierce love for it makes me more biased towards anything new. However there are worth while songs in Ceremonials and you can bet the live performances will rock you off your feet. By now you might be wondering if Ceremonials is better than Lungs... I dont think that it is, however I dont think you should miss it either.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is an emotionally supercharged epic Holocaust story.  Narrated by death and written in a very unique prose style, it is unlike anything I've ever read.  I also love that it is not the traditional Holocaust tale, as it focuses on a German protagonist and her family as they experience life during the war and hiding a Jew.  Personally, I found the story to have a very slow start, but I was hooked after a hundred pages.  I was a little turned off by the strange writing style at first, but again, once I was in, it ceased to be a problem.  It is a daunting read due to its size, but if you can push yourself into it, it will soon go really fast.  By the last bit of the book, I was balling like a baby, again and again.  I think I was crying for the last thirty or forty pages.  I will warn you - there isn't a happy ending, no matter how much you want one.  After all, this is WWII and Nazi Germany.  Death even warns you that it won't be happy, and even spoils it for you in advance, but somehow I refused to believe until it was right in my face.  This is an extremely powerful story, and a beautiful one at that.  I read this for a school book club, and I can't wait to discuss it with my students.  I highly recommend this novel to all.
B006ANJ4BW|5.0|I personally hated the Arnold Schwarzenegger version of Conan, so I was oh-so-happy to watch this one. Conan is a man of little words, however really played the part well. Supporting actors/actresses did a good job contributing to the overall effect of the movie. I think it didn't do as well since everyone is comparing it to the old version instead of appreciating it for what it is. With this being said, overall--I enjoyed it!
0446556750|4.0|The author brings together criminal defense attorney Michael Haller and his half-brother, the cynical, LAPD Detective Harry Bosch.<br />Haller is invited by the DA's office to be a one time special prosecuter on a 24 year old murder case wherein the convicted is set free on a DNA technicality.<br />With Haller jumping the fence & joining the other side in this case, he's backed up by Bosch doing the heavy & dirty work.<br />Courtroom dramas can be dull. This one is engaging & well written. I like Connelly's writing style.<br />The characters come to life. At times you feel as if you're seated in the gallery witnessing the goings-on.<br />The book takes a nice twist toward the end. I found it a very good read

1400069181|4.0|I wrapped up Blake Mycoskie's book Start Something That Matters this week.  Such a great read!  If you have any type of entrepreneurial mindset or if you're in sales, it's a must read!  Blake tells his story about starting TOMS shoes as well as some things he's learned along the way.  Stuff I loved:   When you're selling, lead with your story.    When your story is so good that people who don't work for you are sharing it, good things are headed your way.  Supporters beat customers every time.  Constantly think about new ways to spread the story.  Get your story in front of people who are in a position to tell it to others.  People want to be a part of something that's helping other people.  Do one thing, do it the best you can.  He wraps up the book by saying that when he started TOMS, his purpose was to help as many kids have shoes as he possibly could.  His focus has now shifted to helping other people make an impact on the world.  It's not the deepest book, and you've probably heard most of these concepts before, but it's very readable, and hard to put down  Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Of course the is an app for people who actually believe in worshiping a ficticious charector. I've never understood how anyone can base their lives on something that was stolen from older religions than Christianity. Christianity is nothing more than man made stories written to scare people into believing that they will \\"burn\\" if they don't follow this fake book. Why not worship Santa? It's way easier to believe that a man made and deliverd toys to children than a man was killed and was raised from the grave 3 days later. Ooooooh Jesus is a zombie!! This book was created for no other reason than to control the lives of weak minded people. SHEEP.

B005TQAI6G|5.0|I received my copy in the mail today via the UPS postal service. I had already had the privilege of viewing the show on EPIX the night of the premiere and I was blown away. People can say what they will about Britney Spears, what they claim she is and what she isn't, but there is no doubt the woman is the poster girl for pop music, a transcending phenomenon for all generations. To keep it short and simple, I will say that the Femme Fatale Tour DVD is nothing short of spectacular. You don't have to be a fan per say, but if you are someone looking for an amazing display of talent and pop music perfection, this DVD is for you! You will NOT be disappointed!
1577314808|1.0|Once a book gets this many Amazon.com reviews, it doesn't matter that many of them are negative, it gets attention.  I was savvy enough (this time) to borrow this and another of Eckhart Tolle's books from the library.  So glad I didn't buy them.  I kept paging through each of them, looking for a place where he actually began teaching something, and then I was at the end of the books. If someone has never read books of this genre, never done any searching for life's answers, these might be powerful and insightful, and I'm glad some have found so much within the pages to inspire them.  For me, however, there's nothing new here, not a sentence that opens new possibilities or pulls me into the text to search for nuggets of truth.<br /><br />  I would suggest borrowing them from your library. I use the online search for my library and surrounding libraries and put books on Hold that I want. It usually takes about the same amount of time to get the call that they're in as it would to order them. Some of them, like these, I'm glad I got the chance to read at no charge.  Others, I read and decide to buy to keep for reference or to read more than once. I have too many books that looked good in the reviews and then ended up with little or nothing to offer me.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|This a great cd! Add 5 points to the first one, and that's what you have with this one. I have always been a Hagar fan. Good grooves on this one.

0307593312|4.0|I found 1Q84 nowhere near as captivating as Murakami's best, but I did enjoy it. It struck me as a cross between a storybook and a piece of ambient music - a simple tale with an emotional picture painted via repetition.  Where I found other Murakami novels pulling me down the rabbithole by the throat until I'd turned the last page, 1Q84 pulled me in but then allowed me to comfortably assess the dimensions of my surroundings. The world painted is surreal, but hardly ambiguous. Some may not like this, and while I didn't hate it, that by-the-throat experience is why I love Murakami.  On the other hand, I think it's this straightforwardness that would make this book the easiest Murakami to adapt into a film. A lot of the most striking imagery is visual, not psychological. If Takashi Miike took the reins it could be cool as hell!  The best passages of the book fly by all too quickly (my favorite being in book 2), buffered between long stretches of exposition, but perhaps that was the point. Some readers may be into it, but if you've never read Murakami, start with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Norwegian Wood, or if you have a taste for moderate sci-fi, Hard Boiled Wonderland and The End of the World.
1451648537|5.0|This book is a memory walk for me. I remember my first computer - a KIM, a bare circuit board with a small keyboard and machine language to make it run - and the Apple II I bought as soon as they entered the market. It was the time of possibilities. Steve Jobs is, of course, one of the two main forces behind personal computing (Gates is the other)and understanding Jobs is part of understanding the Apple of today. No doubt the products are legendary. Getting under the skin of the man, which this book manages to do (only because Jobs allowed it to be done), lets us see the almost-angry personality, driven to succeed. No doubt he got the very best out of his people. And yet there is a sadness to it. The bosses I've had, who embodied this same trait, are not the ones I befriended. So the book is as much a study of personality, something deeper than mere biography. Jobs succeeded brilliantly ... but at what cost?
B001DF68MA|3.0|The metal piece that mounts on the bike is very sturdy and well designed.  The plastic seat itself with its footrests is a little flimsy but adequate for my 2.5 year old average size daughter.  The seat can be adjusted back and forth on the metal piece but only slightly (mine is all the way to the front).  My daughter is comfortable enough to doze off on it although she has not used the pad to place her head and sleep like the ad on the website shows (she prefers to lean back instead).  The rider however has to get used to pedal with open knees and depending on the bike the handlebars might not turn full range - on my bike they stop on the seat.  If you believe that placing the kid between you and the handlebars is better than behind you (in my opinion the kid in the front and between your legs is preferable as the bike's center of gravity remains centered allowing for great stability despite the added weight) then I can't really see how one would design it better than the WeeRide.  It also allows for easy kissing access to your kid.  It should handle from a 1.5yr old to an average-sized 4yr old - 40 lb kid no problem.  The price is reasonable but check your local craigslist first.
B005V20JKI|3.0|i dealt with a dozen forced closes and freezes as i tried to install, then i got the game to start and i eventually ended up being routed to a page to create a storage acct somewhere...and i bailed. maybe it is a fun game, but i spent twenty minutes trying to play it and failed.
1442346949|5.0|I wanted to know all about Steve Jobs.  I wanted to know all about Apple and how it began.  I'm so glad I read...er...listened to this book.  It is extremely well-written and the voice on the CD is very easy to listen to.  It even sounds a bit like Jobs.  I would have found a lot of the information in the book too tedious for actual reading, so I listened in my car.  I am fascinated by what this man was able to do, but now I know for certain that I wouldn't have liked him personally.  He was mean on purpose and had a true deficit of empathy.  He lied when it suited his purposes and I have had enough of all that.  Just really glad he was whatever he was because it really worked didn't it?  I do recommend this as an audio book.
006079383X|2.0|With this audiobook being a reading of an old text, the comparisons were mostly from the 1930's to the 1960s. The content would only be sufficient for someone very new to investing who could gain some general information. The speaker was over-dramatic and the overuse of conjunctive adverbs such as \\"thus\\", \\"therefore\\", \\"furthermore\\", etc. were annoying and detracted from the core material.  The following is a portion quoted from the audio towards the end which shows the level of information I'm referring to: \\"...basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal. At other times, he will do better, if he forgets about the stock market, and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the operating results of his companies. The investor with a portfolio with sound stocks, should expect their prices to fluctuate, and should neither be concerned about sizable declines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should always remember that market quotations are there for his convenience either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored. He should never buy a stock because it has gone up or sell it because it has gone down.\\"  Based on the title and description of the product, I was disappointed. I had expected more detailed core investment information and less rambling about outdated comparisons. This product states it's 'abridged', but I found it could have been shortened a good deal more.
0307913090|5.0|I was suffering waiting for Game of Thrones to start back up again.  I think it is one of the best shows ever created.  The book follows the tv show to a \\"T\\".  As I was listening, I began to wonder if I would EVER be able to follow the book without having seen the first season!  There are a lot of characters to keep straight.  Plus there is a different way of speaking in this fantasy land.  Instead of saying someone is 25 years old, the author might say, \\"He was a man grown\\" or \\" He was five and twenty\\".  So, I must admit that driving and listening at times proved difficult.<br /><br />Now I am listening to the second book.  I've been told by an actual reader of the large book that it is the least interesting of all of them and that I am doing the right thing in listening instead of reading it.  Good because reading that brick was never an option.  I am following along really well because I have gotten to know so many of the characters already.  It's tiding me over until the second season begins.  I am truly addicted.<br /><br />Pogo was Drogo's Ko!  Ha ha ha.  See, I'm keeping the characters straight.
B005V20JKI|2.0|The graphics look nice and the gameplay is easy to understand, but there really is nothing interesting or compelling about it. It feels overly simple despite it's &quot;difficulty.&quot; Death comes quickly if you aren't extremely precise, which is just not easy or fun with touch screen controls.  Also, it's basically spyware with the current permission reqs. I just cannot recommend getting this.

1439102813|4.0|\\"Still Alice\\" chronicles through fiction the memory erasure caused by that still incurable disease, Alzheimer's. While not stellar on literary prose standards, author Lisa Genova does a masterful portrayal of what the downward mental descent looks like from the perspective of the Alzheimers patient.   Especially poignant is that the gradual mental erasure of memories and degradation of intellectual strength happens to an accomplished college professor  author of groundbreaking books and a popular lecturer in the classroom and the lecture  circuit.  In essence, who is Alice when her identity as a thought leader evaporates? The title gives a hopeful answer, but I have to admit that as I watch loved ones around me succumb to Parkinson's, Huntington's, and Alzheimer's, I realize I am not yet ready to accept this. Reading \\"Still Alice\\" has been helpful in helping me wrestle with getting to a place of acceptance but I've still got a ways to go.

1451629184|5.0|As the father of a now twenty-year-old who was once Jaycee's age, this is the scariest book I have ever read.     How life can change in an instant. Eleven-year-old Jaycee Dugard was walking to her school bus stop in suburban South Lake Tahoe, California one morning when a car pulled over, the back door opened, and a stun gun triggered. Jaycee was abducted by a convicted sex offender and his wife and held in captivity for 18 years during which she gave birth to two daughters.     Jaycee's story through the news media has been well recorded ([...]) but this memoir recounts it from Jaycee's first person perspective. It is a difficult read emotionally not only because of the horrific facts, but also because one has to accept Jaycee's recounting of the experience on her terms. It's easy to make all kinds of assumptions about what the experience would have been like but Jaycee's unguarded voice and non-bitter tone didn't match what I had expected.     It's remarkable how as an eleven-year-old Jaycee found the psychological strength to manage the horror and to even make a life with her two daughters that did not descend into hatred turned toward others or herself. In the book she also recounts some of her abduction trauma counseling process and it's clear that survival is one thing, recovering from the violations and the lost years is another.
0307454541|5.0|Larsson has developed a compelling character in Lisbeth Salander, the girl of the book's title. I found the other main character, Mikael Blomberg, much less interesting - - despite some autobiographical elements, and the fact that Larsson's own life has its interesting twists and turns that could have made Blomberg more compelling.<br /><br />The core of the story is an investigation into the history of the Vanger family, which controls one of Sweden's largest industrial groups and parts of which are clearly modeled on some of Sweden's real-life family conglomerates. At the bequest of the dying patriarch, the investigation focuses on the 1968 disappearance and presumed murder of Harriet Vanger.<br /><br />The story is framed by vendetta's Blomberg against another Swedish industrial group, whose founder has its own rivalry with the Vangers. However, I found this framing largely unnecessary for this book.<br /><br />That objection aside, this is a tightly-constructed novel whose many threads slowly come together before accelerating toward the final action and resolution. It's well-written (and translated), and manages to convey a strong sense of place in both Stockholm and in an isolated corner of Sweden's north.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I always admired Jane Seymour, so it leaves even me surprised that I never watched this series before. Caught an episode on cable TV a few months ago and was delighted with what I saw. However, coming into a *new* series without the background that this one requires would have made for a less enjoyable viewing. Therefore, when I saw what a low price Amazon had on this series with the movies included, I couldn't keep my finger off the *one click* button. I got my set in just a few days and have now watched the entire series (this is an update of my initial review).<br /><br />One of the things I really like about this show is that it's *clean*. No reliance on smut, profanity or shock value to entice the so-called mature viewer. There is some silliness -- Dr. Quinn's wardrobe should take up her entire house, for instance, and some of the plot lines are rather weak. (The girl with the webbed hands, for instance or the masquerade ball with Seymour in a Cinderella-like costume  -- not likely, the plastic surgery Dr. Quinn is able to perform on the disfigured railroad engineer, etc). Balancing that are some excellent performances by the main cast and the recognition that this was never meant to be Masterpiece Theatre. Outstanding episodes to me were The Abduction and the one where Grace and Robert E.'s son faces a serious illness. I also really enjoyed the episode in which Mr. Brays *runs away*. There are more but these were especially good.<br /><br />Anyone uneducated in the treatment of Native Americans during this time period will appreciate that for the most part, Dr. Quinn truly doesn't gloss over it. We are presented with attitudes that would shock us now but which were common at the time. The Washita episode is heartbreaking and Larry Sellers did an excellent job in conveying the reality behind the perception of Indian stoicism.<br /><br />So it helps immensely that Dr. Quinn has a great cast (my favorites being the lovely Jane Seymour and the sometimes crotchety,always interesting Orson Bean in the role of Mr. Bray).<br /><br />Indeed, there are many, many exciting and very touching moments. Larry Sellers does a wonderful job in conveying Cloud Dancing's innate dignity and Barbara Babcock is perfect as Dorothy. I preferred Erika Florez as Colleen but Jessica Bowman is very good. Chad Allen has some fine acting moments and Joe Lando was a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The core of the series, of course, is the love story between Dr. Mike and Sully. They are *so* different. My favorite part of that storyline is the two-part episode which takes Michaela and the children to Boston with a (justifiably) jealous Sully discovering he has a worthy rival for her affections. So romantic, and so much fun to watch!<br /><br />Anyways, Dr. Quinn is a pretty good series, one you won't be embarrassed to watch in front of your great aunt Bessie or your pre-teen children. The DVD packaging is perfect, in my opinion, and I like that the titles are easily visible on each DVD. I've ordered some series where you had to get out a magnifying glass to see which DVD you were looking at!<br /><br />Very good show and one well worth the money. I'll watch it again in a few years.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Almost didn't grab this when it was the free app, but changed my mind. Glad I did. Reminds me of a mini super smash brothers for android. It is a little buggy and lags sometimes in menus and while grabbing muffins, which sometimes renders the game unplayable. Overall, this will quickly become my favorite game on android, if the lag doesn't keep persisting.  On permissions, I really wish idiots would stop complaining about permissions. Do you really think a company as big as Amazon would advertise and offer an application that would cause widespread damage? Don't you think amazon is worried about their reputation? Stop being paranoid and rate bombing good apps.  App deserves a 4 because of the gamebreaking lag, but posting a 5 to counteract fools and their 1 spam.

B0050KEVO6|5.0|an amazing game that also secretly teaches you science. start with only 4 elements to try and create hundreds from those.  it will rack your brain and keep you guessing and trying more crazy combos. great to challenge your. family members to see who cam figure out more solutions.  just get it already.  very well done. lots of funny results as well will make u laugh out loud for sure.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|works great..has an audio feature which makes it more interesting..i find hearing the bible to be more interesting..havent made it through the whole thing but hopefully its all here
B001EC3JME|4.0|I use this holster with my 2 AA LED Maglites, and it holds them very well. They will not slip out even when it is upside down.<br />In the description it says it is good for D battery sized flashlights - I couldn't get My 3 D Maglite LED in without severely stretching the elastic and if you did it probably wouldn't hold an AA sized light any more and would wear out much faster. The thickest light I would put in it is a Maglite XL 200 LED (1\\" diameter).<br />It can be clipped anywhere on your belt but once on is not easy to get off without removing the belt. It will not come unclipped from your belt by itself.<br />After using 5 days a week for 9 months it is still in very good shape. The only problem is the plastic ratcheting system that holds the flashlight at different angles is wearing out but what would you expect from a plastic system?<br />It can be used like a headlamp but with a better lighting effect because the light source is away from your eyes and therefor gives better modeling to objects enabling you to see depressions in the ground, etc.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a Great Holster for the price if you want to carry 1\\" diameter or smaller sized lights.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is a fantastic app but needs new updates.  in the end it is a very good game to kill time to.

0756405890|1.0|i admit i have only read 60% of the book and am not sure i have it in me to finish this tedious tale.  Do not read this after a masterwork like Song of Ice and Fire.  The main character is pretty conceited and unsympathetic (despite the quite bad things that happen to him).  The flashback style is done poorly.  Hard to worry about a character you know is going to be more or less ok.  Better authors can work around flashbacks though.  Its overlong and in need of serious editing.  I could cut about 30% without sacrificing plot (and improving color).  The other characters are pretty dern flat too.  And lord help their attempts at being \\"clever.\\"  I could waste more time on this review but why put in more effort than the author did?
B000002OOY|5.0|Jurassic Park is still a publishing phenomenon and a blockbuster film franchise—twenty years, 2 novels, four films, and countless companion and tie-in books later. Arguably the world’s most renowned film composer, John Williams, gives us music glorifying the dinosaurs, the whole prehistoric era, as well as the message: Don’t mess with Mother Nature.<br /><br />Noted science fact and fiction novelist Michael Crichton, who won fame with his book, The Andromeda Strain—about a plague in Arizona and the desperate race to contain it—wanted to experiment with a story about a boy and a pterodactyl (extinct flying reptile). Frustrated with early drafts, he finally landed on one of the greatest ideas in all of literature: a modern day theme park full of genetically cloned prehistoric creatures—which the people world can visit for a hefty price. The most ambitious entertainment venture of its time … becomes the greatest race for survival of all time. When a team of scientists arrive to the park for inspection, things go terribly wrong.<br /><br />Thus one of the world’s greatest cinematic franchises was born.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is one of the first movies I ever remember seeing. Only The Land Before Time preceded it. My first exposure to the concept of a dinosaur. Godzilla, King Kong, The Hobbit plus Lord of the Rings, and aliens galore in every mutated monster movie, remain a fiction—they only exist in imagination. But dinosaurs were real. And a few may have survived … I’m reminded that no matter how wonderful or corny you think they are, they’re absolute fact. As real as the history behind Braveheart, Ben-Hur, or The Passion of the Christ.<br /><br />There are three main themes on the CD :<br /><br />The four note rising raptor motif heard in tracks 5, 11, 7, 15, and 16 (which is a fragmented repeat of track 7). These unsettling notes are heard in French horn.<br /><br />The beautiful main theme for the park itself heard in tracks 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. Involving choir, brassy trumpets, and cello strings, it perfectly captures the mystery and wonder of the idea of Jurassic Park.<br /><br />The helicopter Journey to the Island motif heard in tracks 4, 7, and 16 is a trumpet blast of triumph with strings and clashing cymbals.<br /><br />Some other sections have what I call “creepin’ around music” in tracks 1, 3, 5, and 14. Tracks 3, 11, and 15 are bombastic adventure rides, action tracks with banging percussion, clanging bells, and cymbal crashes.<br /><br />While softer moments can be heard in tracks 10 and 12, the few breathers in a score that flows amazingly well, even out of film sequence.<br /><br />Another great aspect of the CD release is much of the score was featured in the film. Tracks 2,5, 11, 14, and 15 feature extended cue sections from the cutting room floor. If you listen carefully, you will appreciate an alternate Main Title crawl in track 2, more raptor danger in track 5, high wire panic for another minute in track 11, plus alternate finale music in track 14. Musical ideas that are better than the final edit!<br /><br />I remember hearing James Horner’s main titles to Land Before Time at age four. The string rose in harmony as the fish whipped across the screen. I was transported to a prehistoric world. I wanted to BE a dinosaur. Both CDs are similarly themed and constructed. Jurassic Park is the better one, and a welcome return to that mystery and wonder, presented in a different package. Instead of entering the Mesozoic from the POV of a creature, man is pitted against prehistoric beast in a modern setting. This is a boy's score through and through (I know personally one woman who liked it). It is a score that will make you jump with fear and floor you with its beauty and haunting power.<br /><br />It perfectly captures the mysteries of childhood—namely initiation into discovering something bigger than yourself—and will be one you will listen to repeatedly and wear out over many happy years.<br /><br />Before Hollywood butchers a remake fifteen years from now, go out and get this wonderful piece of music before it sells out.<br /><br />NOTE: The CD Jurassic Park by John Williams has been rereleased for digital download as a COMPLETE AND UNCUT edition, featuring 11 minutes of previously unreleased music on 4 tracks of approximately 2 and 1/2 minutes each. Plus all the great tracks from the original disc.<br /><br />If nobody’s got a petition together for a CD set release, they should. I believe older fans would like it. I’d be happy to sign my name.<br /><br />Enjoy!llywood butchers a remake fifteen years from now, go out and get this wonderful piece of music before it sells out.<br /><br />NOTE: The CD Jurassic Park by John Williams has been rereleased for digital download as a COMPLETE AND UNCUT edition, featuring 11 minutes of previously unreleased music on 4 tracks of approximately 2 and 1/2 minutes each.

B003UZ46DY|3.0|I don't know what Brandon was thinking here. The drums do not sound 'raw' or natural' they just sound bad, distorted, and some other frequencies as well. It's  really too bad, these songs are overall better than the ones on the new Incubus album but the production just makes it almost impossible to sit through a listening. Actually hurts my ears.
0441013597|5.0|Frank Herbert's Dune chronicles, of which this book is the first, represent the best in science fiction adventure. This book easily laid the groundwork for Star Wars and Star Trek, and even Terminator since the book talks about man's dependency on machines being the downfall of the modern world.<br />The book itself takes place in the far future amid a interplanetary empire and tells the story of 14 year old Paul Atreides and his family moving from their homeworld of Caladan to Arrakis or Dune, a desert planet occupied by desert people (Fremen). It tells of Paul's father's betrayal and assassination by one of his own men and the family's becoming fugitives on the run from the villainous Harkennon noble family who seeks the planet's sole treasure: a spice capable of giving eternal life.<br />Now, without going into all the intricacies of ecology, politics, religion and environmentalism this book offers, let me just say that on the surface it is an entertaining story that will stimulate your mind and make you wonder. Like Gene Brewer's K-PAX, this book will make you think about the subjects it espouses.<br />I recommend this whole-heartedly as one of, if not the greatest Sci-Fi adventure ever.<br />The new edition comes with an afterward by Brian Herbert (Frank Herbert's son) and of course the appedixes which delve into the books themes and points of interest.<br />So go pick this up for a great read over Christmas or summer break. Enjoy!
B001N4OX82|1.0|Hollywood could have come up with a film based roughly on the Iliad that was brilliant but this turkey wasn't it, despite millions of pounds thrown at it and a good cast, good special effects, great photography etc.   I've never seen any of the actors act so badly. The director and the scriptwriter must be to blame for this. Even Peter O'Toole isn't as good as usual except when he's saying words from 'The Iliad'. Brad Pitt isn't a believable Achilles, and his having to act the hard man in a denim mini skirt and pink lipstick made me laugh out loud in places. The fight scenes, with the jumping or dancing about, soon lose their interest.  They've done a character assassination of the demi God Achilles of the Iliad here. This Achilles is a jerk while the cornball unconvincing love affair with the Cassandra/Chriseis/ Polyexena/Briseis composite takes up too much of an already over long film.   Commercialised rubbish. Avoid.
0061650994|5.0|A Christmas Carol has been a holiday favorite since it was first published in 1843. The original novella has been abridged to picture-book length with new illustrations, and a fine picture book it makes!   The text is not only shorter but also more accessible while still true to Dickens. For example, \\"Scrooge, a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire\\" has been simplified to \\"He was a scraping old sinner, hard and sharp as flint.\\" The plot, too, is streamlined. Gone is Scrooge's little sister, Fan, and gone, too, is Belle, the girl Scrooge almost married, but the three Christmas ghosts appear in all their mystery and magic. Mysterious and magical, too, is the new artwork, combining watercolor, pencil, and pastel to brighten the joyful parts of the story and shadow the eerie events. The result is a winning presentation, sure to please.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I have reviewed the \\"limited Edition\\" release of WSS earliar.  Many reviewers were annoyed of the fade out in the overture, and the audio sync problems later on in the film.  Well, I have good news for us fans who purchased the defective transfers.......<br />  As of March 27th, 2012, I have talked to customer service at MGM/UA. They are willing to send out replacement disks. When asked if ALL the problems have been corrected, David, the phone rep. said \\"yes\\". Call MGM/Ua at 1-888-223-4369. Their reps will take your information and send you an email with a (U.P.S.) shiping slip. Mail out the disks, and they will send out replacements! This information should have been placed out on the internet when it became effective. Time will tell if the transfer is worth the wait!<br />  As for the booklet that came with the \\"50th anniversary\\" versions out there, it is smaller and more basic than the booklet from the 40th anniversary release.  40th comes with more information of the production.  The 50th limited edition\\" of the film also came with a 8 music track c.d.  of cover music from the likes of Julie Andrews to Maynard Fergusion.  All the tracks were released from earliar solo albums.<br />  If you have the 40th annivsary dvd that came with the more infomative booklet, just buy the lowest end of the blu-ray of the film.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Well done, very fun, very addicting. Only complaint is that I ran out if levels, I can't wait to get more.
0817439390|4.0|This is the first in Bryan Peterson's \\"Understanding\\" quadrilogy, and along with the volume on Flash Photography it is built around a very succinct, practical and simple philosophy on how to expose for both ambient and and flash light.   That philosophy is described in very easily understood terms, that is already making a meaningful difference to my photography. I've always had a good eye for composition and texture, but have always struggled to translate the vision to the captured image. These books have provided the key to the conundrum.  Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I read a review that this does not work for the kindle fire. Wrong! It works just fine. No problems whatsoever. In fact I use it every morning when I am sitting on the toliet having my coffee to determine what to wear for the day.   It's a shame that people do not know how to use technology and then give it a bad review for their incompetence.
B004FOA84A|2.0|This game is a nice puzzle game but its over so quickly you'll be left wondering if its a demo. That wouldn't be so bad if it were replayable but the puzzles Stat exactly the same so there is no replay value unless you have a short-term memory problem.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|This item was in wonderful condition.  I bought it for my boyfriend for our 1 year anniversary and he loved it. He even gave the dinosaur a name. The blu-rays are very good and the picture is great this is an all around great purchase I was not disappointed. We watch the movies all the time.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Great app but the ommission of standard landscape orientation support is a deal breaker. Makes the experience poor and app low quality.
B005K17RU0|5.0|No idea how some of the reviewers here are possibly having problems.  I entered my zipcode, touched the city when it was found, then boom - all the weather information I could need.  Maybe they had their wireless off or something, who knows.  As far as the app goes, there is an animated radar, video on the current conditions and forecast, and the main homescreen has a scrollable hour by hour detailed temperature and weather forecast.  Essentially everything you need for planning your day.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I remember seeing the original Jurassic Park in the theaters some 8 times the summer it came out, I loved that movie.  Seeing my opportunity to own it in Blu Ray definition and clarity, that was an easy decision.

B002SRQ214|5.0|i upgraded my old pc and installed:  AMD 965  gigabyte 880GM-D2H motherboard  gigabyte HD6570 1 gb graphics card  corsair 600watt psu  the only problem i found is that the clamp for the cooler on the cpu wont clamp completely into the lock position. otherwise, it is very tight on the cpu and the mobo and is not going anywhere.  Its like a new pc and when i get the money next month, i will install a new hard drive and complete the whole thing.   the cpu fit into the motherboard socket perfectly and comes with the thermal paste already applied.
1451648537|4.0|This is a very well written book.  Mr. Isaacson wrote it in such a way that it was as if he was having a conversation with me.  Very satisfying.  Also, an amazing subject.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|When I got my fire I went on a buying spree. I found this one. Great quick app to play.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|This one was ok.  It wasn't nearly as good as the one from 1996 with Colin Firth.  I think it might've been because this one was too short.  Mr. Darcy in this one didn't cut it, but I liked Kiera Knightly's take on Elizabeth.  She added some spunk to it, which was neat to see.
B005ORVMT2|1.0|Caution- the CD version of Fly By Night contains several dropouts during the songs. As far as I can tell they are not on the DVD audio version though. I hope they offer some kind of replacement deal.  UPDATE- Now there is another problem...the A Farewell To Kings DVD is missing the percussion on the intro to Closer To The Heart(stereo version). If you dont believe me, check it out for yourself. There is no excuse for this.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|In my youth, I read Mr. Howard's Conan novels, ...and this recent cinematic version is probably more in line with the way he imagined it!   Theres no shortage of savage sword-play, splattered blood, severed heads, and scantily-clad women! Robert E. Howard would be proud to put his stamp of approval on this.  If you liked the original Conan the Barbarian of 1982, starring Arnold Schwartzenegger, you won't be disappointed either. Where the 1982 version had a more mythic feel (especially with Basil Poledouris' sound-track), ...the new version is definitely the original gut-gripping action-all-the-way pulp-novel come to life! Jason Momoa is even more convincing as the brooding barbarian who stomps across the Hyborean world with sword in hand. Niether movie follows a specific plot to one of the many Conan novels. Its the general \\"idea\\" of Conan that matters here, its still pretty good! Give us at least two sequels!
030726999X|5.0|I read this book about a year ago. I love this series, and I feel as though this ended it satisfactorily. As with the others, it's spell-bounding, suspenseful, and smart. I profusely recommend it.
B005PW3OS8|2.0|Chris Evans is great for the part and does a bang up job, even with the wax museum looking girlfriend. The girlfriend should look like Betty Grable... not like an oily haired fish face. The movie lacks a 1940's dialogue... as in slang... which really ruins it in so many ways. Tommy Lee Jones looks way to old in his part and should give it up or get his face tightened up. There's no smoking in the movie but people getting killed is fine... typical PC crap. There are way too many Cobalt blue lights in this movie and it really makes things look phony. It would have been nice to see how the Captain learned how to use the shield... instead we are treated to what amounts to be a series  of video game combat scenes that lack meaning. Also... you can't look at the big bad guy without thinking \\"Matrix\\"... a bad casting choice. I'd say rent it first before you buy. The end is a little weird... we end up with our boy from the hood as the  Man etc... I'm not in the mood to explain it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love it.  Been a mahjongg nut for years, great version,  playing on my Kindle Fire.  Graphics excellent, suggestions good for beginners, great way to spend some free time ;)
B003C1SPX8|4.0|I have never experienced a DVD where the bonus material completely changes my perspective about th! That is, until I experienced Alchemy. But I am getting ahead of myself ..  The 10+ songs on the list here are a mixed bag, some excellent, some deserving to be on the 'B-side'. Knopfler shines through via his wizardry with the strings, however, his vocals are nothing to write home about. The other two guitarists seem to be on a mission to burn 1000 calories in some weird stepping sequence. Argh! The material was not Dire Straits like at all. The remastered sound was sub-par and the video quality, as others have reported, was from VHS era.  Then on a lark, I checked the bonus material. Two studio songs - 'Tunnel of love' and 'Sultans of swing' were rendered in true DS fashion, and the mood begins to lift. Following these is the BBC documentary, Arena, which torques it up higher. 'Where you think you're going', 'Down to the waterline' and 'Making movies' are re-discovered here, the last one as a work in progress, and provides an insight into DS in a creative phase. Viewers are treated to Pick Withers on the drums, and realization dawns that the drummer in the main segment is not PW, but an ersatz one.  For DS fans, the bonus material obliterates the folly of the main segment, which was rather disappointing.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I see lots of people complaining about the lack of extra features with this set. That's not a problem for me. I bought this set as a Christmas present for my daughter. She's not interested in commentaries and other extra stuff. She just likes to watch the movies, so this is perfect for her. The Amazon price was $48 when I ordered mine last week (and it qualified for free shipping, which only takes a day or two longer in my experience). That works out to $6 per movie, a pretty good price in my opinion. And logging in today to write this review, I see the price has dropped to $39.99. That works out to $5 per movie, an even better deal.  If you're not interested in all the extra stuff (that people will pay a lot more money for when the super duper amazing deluxe set is released in the future) and just like to watch the movies, this collection is a good option. It's convenient to have all the movies in one compact set at a great price.  On a side note, I was in Walmart yesterday and noticed they're selling this set for $70.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|Even with all those books, websites and television series about Henry VIII, it is still hard to gauge his true character and his motives. Historians differ...Even the British, I understand.  About twenty years ago there was an Anna Bolena performance in la Monnaie, Brussels.  The performance was sponsored by a large international organization, and its chairman praised it during supper afterwards.  This chairman, being British, said he enjoyed the opera, but then he hesitated, realizing all this had happened in his \\"beloved\\" country...   I have seen the television series, I have read some books.  I guess that this magnificent video expresses everything that can be expressed about the history of Anna Bolena.    All characters are very meticulously casted.  They perfectly fit the images I made based on books, historical articles and television.  I do recognize the main characters, Anna, Jane, the King, Percy...  They are what I imagined they should be.  With all their emotions, with all their motives, with all their personality.  This is not only magnificent belcanto, but also magnificent drama and tragedy.    The music is outstanding, all performers sing outstandingly, the choir and orchestra are outstanding, the production is outstanding.  And it all fits together.  Go and buy this dvd!
B003UD7JEE|5.0|This series is very similar to Alias with a light hint of 24.  It has a decent amount of action with twists and turns to keep your interest.  There are enough episodes for the story line to develop.  If there is a Season 2, I will be buying it.
0307716988|5.0|This book is a wonderful look into Michael's life.  I have read it more than once and each time it's like visiting with Michael. Every Michael Jackson fan should buy this book to get a clear view into MJ's life and career.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 was my first Stephen King book so I'm not sure if this is his kind of writing style or just something he tried. I wouldn't recommend it if you haven't read any of his books before. I think a novel would be much better before starting something like this. Overall the story line was pretty good although I didn't like the ending very much. It's basically a series of short stories about characters that become involved with the \\"villain\\" of Mile 81. The only thing I disliked about this was that it didn't really go over the station wagon's \\"history\\". I was curious to see where it came from, why it was there etc. Seeing how short this is I think every Stephen King fan should give it a try.
B005K17RU0|1.0|this app does not work on kindle fire. it is true it only lets you input the city only and that's it. It does not show any weather and comes up with a forced shutdown exception error.
B005JZBP8W|1.0|This Blu-ray of 'My Fair Lady' is not in the least what a Blu-ray<br />ought to be. It's merely the image of a DVD stored on a carrier of<br />bigger capacity and with higher resolution. I'd like to call that<br />pixellaneous dissipation.<br /><br />The late Jack Warner spent a great deal of money to produce this<br />masterpiece - too much, so he couldn't afford to secure the rights<br />of further distribution. If one - like CBS - has the privilege of<br />having obtained these legal rights, one should have the appropriate<br />obligation to care for such a work of art with due respect.<br /><br />That - I regret to ascertain - they have not done.
B00005JKNC|4.0|I liked this sentimental film. I would commend it to all who feel that they can do with a bit of soft-hearted, love the  people and they will love you, movie-making. However, do not, at the price of years of nightmarish life, perhaps for the rest of your life, take seriously the segment related to Congressional Committees. All that was said and done in the film, was, in pretty much identical form, tried by one or another, witness before the Committee mentioned. In fact, ten (mentioned in the movie) did plead First not Fifth Amendment Rights, the Federal Courts denied that protection, all went to prison and, perhaps even more painful, were barred from the incomes they had had, some selling scripts using front men, who took most of the money and all the glory, some using pseudonyms, and, though formerly top writers in Hollywood, now took beggars wages, some saw their marriages destroyed, their families disrupted, their friends deserting them; it was, in fact, Hell. Some played the game and were shunned by former friends for the rest of their lives while being barred from any important Hollywood connection. Just watch the hearings of someone appointed to the Supreme Court whom the majority seriously want to prevent sitting on that Court. No holds barred in attempts to destroy any vestige or a favorable image of the person.  Well, no matter, you will not heed this advice. Never mind. Go to the movie for some hours of sweet sentiment.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I am completely re-writing this review because LinkedIn and Amazon finally gave us the latest version of the LinkedIn app. Prior to a couple weeks ago, it was a very old version that had almost no functionality.<br /><br />Now, the app is fully functional and is perfectly optimized for 7\\" or larger tablet. I am very happy with the change and am now using this app on a daily basis.
1419702238|3.0|My 9 year old said \\"I think Jeff Kinney is just looking for things to say now.\\"  However, this same child has read through this book at least twice now.  He owns every possible book in the series and both movies.  He tends to carry all his books around with him, it's rather comical.  I think he really enjoyed the book.  What I perceive to be the problem is, the hype.  This book was just so hyped up, and anticipated, that anything less than perfection is going to be a disappointment.<br />It's a book that kids will read and I got it for under $10 with free shipping.  That works for our family.  And, if my son reads it more than once, that's an added bonus.  This certainly isn't The Hobbit, or Gone With the Wind... but it's quirky, kept my son engaged, and was cheap for a hardcover.<br />My son showed me some of the drawings and made me read some of the parts in here, so I'll have to add parts of the book were even worth sharing.  Doesn't that make for a good book?  When you feel something is so funny or even sad that you have to share it with someone?
0385738773|5.0|Sometimes I am dissappointed with the ending of a series, but this time I was not.  The book was action packed with lots of twists and interesting and unexpected plot developments.  We get to see more of the humanity of the characters in this book and that Thomas and his friends are, despite all they have been through, just kids who have been manipulated by a bizarre system.  Is WICKED good?  You will have to read the book to find out.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|You've heard of it, right?  Too doomsday for you?     Sorry, this is your life, your future. Your history. Your new reality.  You need to know why your America is going through what it is.  In many ways, it will inspire you.  Inside Job left me with a sense of deep sadness...  The kind of sadness that comes from having the wool lifted, the scales dropped, and the innocence of mind taken away.  The issues discussed in the documentary are too important to ignore or whitewash.  It was imperitive for me to hear the rot from the mouths of several Wall Street goons. The lies, the delusion, the pander and total bull from the politicians, the lobbiests, the CEO's, and chairmen of the Wall Street banks and insurrance companies.  It was vital for me as an American to know why my country is in so much debt.   Why my neighborhood is changing it's face for a poorer and downtrodden one.   Why this happened, and how it started, and who is in charge of the game today.  It was a very fair and unbiased documentary. It showed how administrations, both Republican and Democrat, have had their hands in the pie.  Watch it. It will help you understand what happened, and why.  If you are already enlightened, the interviews are too good to miss.   An excellent example of journalism, an excellent example of a well researched and executed documentary. Graphs, quotes, books, video, interviews and statistics make for a contempary and intriguing film.  There's never a dull moment.  Greed, disaster, bribery, theft, gambling, and a nicely woven web  of poison.  It's about the biggest gansta gig.  A perfect heist.  The beautiful deal.  And they stole from you.
B000002KHB|4.0|Deep Purples Machine Head was the 1st 8 track ( anyone know what that is? ) that I ever bought. I bought it as a teenager back when it was released just on a whim. I was really getting into rock and was a huge Zep fan. With a name like Deep Purple and a title of Machine Head it had to be good right? Didnt know I was buying into what would be a huge part of rock history. Now who doesnt know of Smoke on the Water. But this album is much more than that, this was the original Deep Purple before alot of line up changes. I can remember videos of Purple most memorable that huge organ being rocked back and forth which reminds me this is perhaps the only band besides Steppenwolf to make a organ a big part of its makeup in hard rock. Funny Im writing this mainly because for my most recent birthday my rock buddy bought me this album cover perfect and not near a scratch on it. If I didnt want to play it so often Id just frame it !
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I like this game. easy to play, has a lot of challenge to it. lets you use different kinds of birds.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|I bought this album upon its release. Just so happened it was being played in a import record store as I walked in, I didnt shop that day I just stood and listened. I was in shock from the guitar sounds that Roth was putting out, it made me think of a guitar being absolutely drained of everthing that it had. Even today I describe it as mythical !    What a live album ! Filled with songs from their 3 albums before done live with driving power Tokyo Tapes is one of the greatest guitar driven recordings ever ! Personaly I dont believe that the Scorps ever did anything even close to it. I use to blow people away with this album and still do. I lost my copy and only recently replaced it and with a little magic I even put my favorite song \\" Polar Nights \\" on it twice I love it that much........ Before that I told a collector friend of mine about this album and he found a copy in mint condition and is absloutely amazed with it , he thought that he had heard everything rock,he still thanks me for it. Thats the power of Tokyo Tapes !!!!    I still laugh when thinking back upon when Rock Me Like a Hurricane came out really bringing The Scorpions to light , people going nuts over them and then I pull out Toyko Tapes and shock would set in lol.     Now I will admit when I first replaced my album with the cd I was so upset with the song ( Polar Nights ) being left off that I threw the cd away. Bad Mistake bad Mistake ! Its just that Polar Nights is so killer. Well Ive remedied that times 2. The song We'll Burn The Sky allways has and even now gives me cold chills. Im not sure what happened with Roth, but to me that man is a guitar god and Ive never heard anyone like him. Just check out the beginning of the Song Speedys Coming another favorite of mine it makes me think of some mythical beast coming to life..... Anyway in my opinion Toyko Tapes defines what the Scorp's were all about and if you can find any live album by anyone with the power of Tokyo Tapes, well let me know. Also you can remedy the absence of the great POLAR NIGHTS by getting a copy of Taken By Force which remastered has it on it, and just add it in on your media player you may end up like me and throw it in more than once.    The over all power of this album is such that once a month my bud and me both collectors get together for 6 to 8 hours and just rock out playing some of the best of both of our giant rock collections and before the night is over for some reason Tokyo Tapes allways ends up re-arranging all the decorations on the rock room walls. It has to be played cranked !!!!!
B005V20JKI|4.0|Fun &amp; addictive game, controls could use some work on samsung galaxy S. I've died many a time cause my character didn't jump when I hit the button &amp; the game sometimes freezes up on the load screen or after you've paused it. Other than those few quirks this game is pretty simple &amp; entertaining, get all the muffins you can while either avoiding or killing the onslaught of sheep/goats.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Several issues down a few more to go...  Yahoo finally responded - after much delay - to customers and fixed the initial issue that limited users to viewing only one screen, and only 10 messages, at a time. The app now scrolls as it should. No more requirement to view email messages in landscape mode. There was then a persistent problem wrt loading on a Kindle Fire HD (we'd get a perpetual loop of the app interface asking for a login name & password, which never connected us to the Yahoo Mail service). Then the navigation capabilities on a Kindle Fire HD 7\\" failed and were not consistently visible (forcing users to open emails to view navigation tools or ending up in a loop of no access to mail folders if one got stuck in a folder with no emails to open). And, just to keep things interesting, in the phone rendition of the app notifications were/can be a disaster and do not always work.<br /><br />The most recently updated interface design of the Yahoo Mail app was an improvement over the old interface aesthetically (it got rid of that gosh awful prior arrangement in which the ads took up over 1/3 of the app's 'real-estate' on a relatively small smart phone or 7\\" tablet display). The new design is elegant and clean. The folders run down the left vertical 1/3 of the display (tablet and smart phone - mine a Samsung Galaxy S III) with a viewing panel of messages showing in the right 2/3 of the screen. Very nice! Easy to scan. The button controls are now intuitive and boast symbols that are laid out such that they are easy to use and maneuver through.<br /><br />[UPDATE - April 2013]  Yahoo seems to have released an update (2.5) that now fixes the dangerous lack of navigation facilities for moving backwards to an email folder once it has been opened to view emails in that folder without having to open an email to move back up the folder hierarchy - at least it now works again on a Kindle Fire HD 7\\" tablet. A very welcome & needed fix. So thx to the developers. There is still a quirk though - that relates to the new STAR categories functionality. YMail added the ability to star vital messages to be able to scan down a list of emails and spot them quickly. They also added a top-level folder that is supposed to sort and present those starred messages. A terrific functionality. But, I can only speak to the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" tablet, there is a problem with the Star function and that top-level Star Folder - it only includes 5 starred messages. There should be no limit to the number of starred emails that should appear there! I only put stars next to 7 messages as a test of the new feature. Yet, no matter what I do, only 5 messages appear in the Star Folder. Developers, that needs a fix. I have re-upped my rating from 1-star to 4-stars because of the new aesthetic design and the fixed navigation issues on the Kindle Fire HD tablet. If the Star folder situation gets fixed on my Fire HD and all the crazy performance issues wrt notifications, email even working, etc. on all major smart phones (like the Galaxy S3) I'll move this rating up to 5-stars.<br /><br />I don't see that Star functionality on my Samsung Galaxy S III at all. But then I haven't run the latest two updates due to 1-star reviews on the Play Store stating that those updates totally messed up other folks' Samsung Galaxy S III Y-Mail implementations and now they can't get any mail on their phones...<br /><br />Hope their new CEO keeps on the developers' cases to get with the program (so to speak...) and make Yahoo apps work fluidly, intuitively, highly functionally on a consistent basis and in a user-centric and non-alienating manner no matter what the platform.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|its a great movie for all ages  the music  is wonderful the colors magnificent and the movie itself is a classic  i just love it
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Fun game with a cute storyline, so I decided to check it out on the Kindle Fire. Graphics look great, but half the time the game doesn't register when I select a web. I have to select it 5-6 times before it will register/disappear... VERY annoying! I haven't had this problem with any other games on the Fire yet. The game is worth a play, but be aware that the controls on the Fire aren't up to par with some of the other games (like Plants vs. Zombies, Bedazzle, or Angry Birds - all recommended on the Fire!).
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This film is exactly what Indiana Jones 4 failed  to be,a great film. It took it's time telling a story of a beloved character instead of having explosions in your face for 2 hours! and it's set as the appropriate period piece it should be! don't listen to the nay sayers. if you believe a story based on a comic book can be more than just dead brain action pieces, CGI, and can excel as a nostalgic matinee serial action drama. This is Your movie.
0393338398|5.0|I don't know if my 5 star review is for the author or simply for Billy Bean.<br /><br />This was an incredibly thought provoking book.  The theme of the book was Billy Bean's non orthodox method for picking players as a GM of the Oakland A's.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on the traditional characteristics favored by Scouts he had a method focused on a concentration on contributing to run scoring or in the case of defense and pitching, preventing runs.<br /><br />Basically, he cut through all of the BS in traditional baseball and found a method for winning the most games possible on the lowest budget possible.<br /><br />Billy focused on the underlying contribution a person could make to the team in achieving wins and didn't worry about the person's demeanor, style, appearance, etc.<br /><br />By doing this he was able to have one of the most successful teams of the early 2000/s on only a fraction of the budget of most of his competitors.<br /><br />This book was a strong statement in the promotion of efficiency and overcoming stereotypes.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The Good:  Texture of the case.  Light-weight.  Easy to use.<br /><br />The Bad:  $$$ when it should be $$ or better yet $.<br /><br />The Annoying:  Takes some practice to get it to stand up correctly.<br /><br />Overall:  Generally satisfied - recommended if you can get it on sale.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Even though I have read everything Stephen King has ever written, I almost didn't buy this book because of the subject matter. I thought that it would be some sort of terrible, historical horror fiction, mess. I was so wrong. I would put this book  in my top ten King favorites.  You won't be disappointed by this one.

1451627289|5.0|Just finished reading S K's latest, and I enjoyed it very very much. The storyline was fascinating, the idea of time-travel is an old one, but S K's version was freshly done. I had thought, initially, that I was going to be disappointed, simply because a lot of S K's stuff is so very over-the-top. . . .I was expecting that he's throw in monsters, or vampires, or weirdness like killer-clows. . .and I was glad that he didn't.<br /><br />It was especially fascinating to see a glimpse (although fictional) into Oswald's home-life. . . my favorite parts were showing Marina dealing with Oswald, and while I realize it was 100% fiction, is was still an eerie glimpse into life in the early 60's.<br /><br />The love-story portion of the book was very heartfelt and moving. The politics part of the story is the least interesting part.<br /><br />One thing you'll definitely do when reading this novel. . . you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering if Jake/George will tell his lover, Sadie about the fact that he has come from the future. I won't say if he does or not, you'll have to read it and see.<br /><br />I was in 2nd grade when Kennedy was shot, and I remember it all very well. S K got a lot right, and although he tells in the afterword how he's gotten flak for how harshly he treats Dallas in the book, he bows-up and spouts some of his own hatred by saying he did NOT get it wrong at how racist and hate-filled Dallas was in those years. It sounds as if even he still harbors some of that hatred even 45+ years after the time period he writes about. Sounding sort-of like the pot calling the kettle, well, you know what i'm saying. . .<br /><br />Some of S K's research wasn't up to par either. In three or four instances he has the main character, Jake, notice the smell of the oil wells drifting into Fort Worth from West Texas and in one instance even remarks that these smells are coming from Midland-Odessa. This is ridiculous, as Midland-Odessa is 300 miles from Fort Worth!<br /><br />I've lived in Dallas all my life, and have never, ever smelled the oil wells from 300 miles away. It's ridiculous to think that it could even happen.<br />This was obviously just an instance of a writer looking for a way to describe a setting, and writing something that sounds descriptive, but not realizing that it's just impossible. This was lazy writing, but then S K has always been known as the type of writer who would throw everything in and leave it, and he's even admitting to this trait before.<br /><br />Another descriptive act of laziness that S K came up with is: twice he mentions being in Fort Worth and seeing a tumbleweed blowing across a street.<br />I've been in Tx all my life and have never seen one single tumbleweed in the entire state! I've seen plenty of them in western Kansas, but never in Tx, or Oklahoma, and certainly never ever ever in Dallas or Fort Worth.<br /><br />Also, he has one character, in 1960, referring to the Dallas and Fort Worth area as 'DFW'. This term was never used until after the DFW airport was finished in 1973, and even then the term took several years to take hold and become commonplace.<br /><br />The only reason I even mention these 'hiccups of faulty or lazy research' is because S K himself made a point of mentioning his extensive research in his afterword, and because he almost gleefully slams Dallas for being hate-filled (and he does so with his own voice of hatred)<br /><br />What S K, and everyone else outside of Dallas needs to remember, is that the past is the past, our city's history need NOT be something that the current residents need to accept the blame for. We didn't pull the trigger. If S K believes, as he says, that a lone gunman was the assassin, then blame that lone gunman, and not the city itself, or the people of that city.<br /><br />Off the soapbox now . . . . .I really enjoyed the story. This is one of those 'impossible to put down' novels that make you sleepy all day long at work every day because you've stayed up reading long into the night.
B004LUS390|4.0|Very nicely done app, very nice features, superior graphic editing ability on smartphone- would give five stars if it didn't crash when asked to open a photo.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|With regard to the Blu-Ray set titled \\"Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]\\" these are NOT the original, theatrical versions of the films.  This took me a while to figure out so I'm posting this.  The Blu-Ray versions are based on the 1997 \\"Special Editions\\" with additional changes.  This also applies to the \\"Complete Saga\\" of all 6 films on Blu-Ray and DVD.  Also, the Blu-Rays are not the same content-wise as the DVDs.  I believe all the DVDs linked to these reviews are also the \\"special\\" editions, but honestly I'm not sure how many different DVD versions are all mixed in here.  Finally, I'm giving this product 2 stars because I - PERSONALLY - do not care for the special editions and hope to someday buy the ORIGINAL original trilogy on Blu-Ray.  The shortcomings of the special editions are explained by the reviewer in the above-linked review, so I won't go into it.  Moreover, you probably aren't reading this review because you've never seen Star Wars, you probably only want to know what is going on with all these different versions, which is difficult to figure out because Amazon mixes reviews for various versions.

0670022950|5.0|(I listened to the audiobook)<br /><br />This book is very long, but I found it extremely engaging.<br /><br />Although I regularly read reviews on Amazon, I rarely post them.  But I strongly feel that this book has been unfairly relegated to the 4 star category when it really deserves at least 4.5.  So I have to chime in.  Here are the pros and cons I can think of at the moment:<br /><br />PROS:<br />Engaging writing style.<br />The book's reasoning just seems so orderly and logical.<br />Even though it's very long, it's not fluffy.<br />I found the many topics that it covered extremely interesting.<br />It has a happy ending.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sometimes I found myself uncritically accepting its view on an issue because the writing was so persuasive to me.<br />The book did loose my attention a bit at a couple of points when it was describing statistical evidence related to events that, it seemed to me, would be very difficult to quantify.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the few books that I will be listening to again, and I may even *gasp* buy a hard copy and read it.
B0068CA3OW|3.0|its a lil bit toooo sexual for me. LOUD WAS WAYYY BETTER! this album reminds me of rated r which i wasnt a fan of, but i will continue to buy her albums, this one wasnt it for me.  That was my first review...  This is my new review...  I will still say it has way more sex than what I anticipated but people have to understand if you listened to Rated R, the sex in her lyrics started to begin, there was a lil more added in LOUD(my 2nd favorite album of hers) and now this is the album full of it. Yes, this artist used to be child appropiate but sad to say SEX SELLS, and the artists are gonna put it in their music in any way that they choose, whether its just full out or in catchy phrases. There were 4 songs on this album that I did not like but after giving those songs another chance I can deal with them. I bought the album and I don't want to waste my money. I think Rihanna is a great artist. I do agree that this album sounds kind of rushed as I read in other reviews. It sounded really really rushed to me, but hey artists have to keep up with their costs of fancy living. I will continue to by Rihanna's albums I know they are bound to get better. Good Girl Gone Bad and Loud will always be the best two albums to me and Rated R is the worse to me, it was so boring.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|Andy Serkis' portrayal of Caesar, the genetically enhanced chimp that leads his fellow primates to revolt, is visually arresting and stunning.  The previews for this movie had me so excited, I couldn't wait to see it, and this film does not dissapoint!    The film is incredibly well made, and paced.  The special effects are amazing and lifelike, especially Caesar.  Several themes can be found throughout, from the cautionary warnings of experimentation on animals, to the idea that living things can be considered \\"property\\", and that man's hand can act like God subjegating lower forms of life for their own gains.  Not only is it a roller coaster ride of a film, but also makes you think just a little bit.  Only one thing I took issue with that didn't quite make the grade for me was the last straw that causes Caesar to turn against his human captors and let loose the apes of war.  It was just one scene, but disappointiongly predictable, for a movie that really had a lot going on and was otherwise very intruiging from beginning to end.  But the reason soon became trivial, and to watch Caesar calculating and premeditating the release of himself and his fellow ape captives was just awesome!   Hollywood needs to wake up and recognize motion capture acting as a viable Art in and of itself, and Mr. Serkis has done amazing things bringing characters like Gollum, King Kong, and Caesar to life.  As other reviewers have pointed out, several nods and winks to the franchise throughout the film, the filmmakers were well-versed in the lore of the series, which is a good sign.  Overall, a great thrill-ride you won't want to miss!  I can't wait to see where we go from here.  Make no mistake, this is only the Beginning...of the Beginning.
1416562605|5.0|Being Indian I often ignore or overlook Indian authors. I've always thought there is probably no dimension or idea they can probably offer me that I am not already aware of. Also the slightest hint of western influence in an author's writing is met with much grimace by folks like me. I never read Indian authors because I like many other Indians don't believe they can bring to the table an exciting read. Well, a very noble knowledgeable friend recommended WHITE TIGER to me. He mentioned it thrice. I read this on my Kindle and was the first book I ever purchased for it. And man, did I absolutely love it?<br /><br />The film has a great voice, the author is funny but he grows on you and eventually by the time the book was over, I could not agree with him more. The book is very relevant to any generation of alive Indians. It is humorous from the start to finish yet it is moving to find why it's called the white tiger.<br /><br />I shall read more from this author and shall read more by Indian authors because I relate more to them than hatchback.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|Though disappointed that my size wasn't available in that charming yellow, I am nonetheless thrilled with my new red croc boots! They are simple, easy to put on, and I have no doubt that they will serve their purpose well. A brief walk about the house told me that - as in other reviews - these will rub my ankles for a minute. No worries though. I've learned that breaking in shoes over several days (wearing only for a few hours at a time) typically solves that problem - either the shoes softening up or my ankles toughening up! I typically wear a 7 1/2 to 8, so I bought a size 8, which seems to be perfect and fine with thick socks too. I used to poke such bad fun at the croc cult... now I own 3 pair. They really are great for slushing around in any kind of weather.
B005NQ94KS|4.0|Playing Emma Morley in One Day, Anne Hathaway simply outshines and she does this thing where she leaves me completely bemused talking to the walls asking if they saw what I saw. I don't know if I should credit the film or Anne Hathaway alone, she is an absolute delight to watch act. One Day somehow gave me exactly what I thought it would. Jim Sturgess is an ok actor. The direction is self satisfied and doesn't try to be as ambitious as the storyline is - which to me is an ideal mix.
B0058VW36U|4.0|The game is really fun and addictive but the only problem is that the amazon appstore dosnt get the updates the same time as the android market.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|the action scenes are well choreographed and they are integrated well with the story. I also saw the sequel to this movie and did not like it as much as this one (the sequel seemed a remake of either Rocky 3 or 4, I can't remember, its the one with the Russian dude in it)
B005PTQPU0|3.0|Somewhat mixed emotions concerning this one. I like that it's a concept album, in the vein of Hounds of Love or Aerial, so there is a certain kind of coherence to it. It's also good that she keeps on exploring, like she always has done, her own paths without concern to what's currently hot or on the charts. There are some problems with this album though which keep it from reaching the excellent. These problems are:  - we don't hear her enough. When I buy a KB album, I would like to hear her sing. This wish is jarred on this album by two facts: 1) there are a lot of guest vocalists on the album and they are given too much prominence, and 2) a lot of the passages where we hear her voice are spoken. E.g. I put on this album and I don't hear her voice but instead that of her son; she comes in only considerably later. At the start I was like \\"Oh, is this Kate Bush? She does sound strange nowadays.\\", only later realising it was her son's voice. On the single Wild Man we hardly hear her singing vocals at all; in the verses she's speaking and in the chorus her voice is drowned by guest vocalists. The presence of Stephen Fry or Elton John doesn't disturb me, but in other passages Kate shouldn't be shy or afraid to let her own singing voice be heard; it's as if she is aware her voice is different nowadays and tries to cover it with different means. Her voice is by no means soaring or bold or experimental like it used to be sometimes before, but it's not so bad she should try to cover it - why make an album at all in that case? About the only track satisfactory in this sense is the album closer \\"Among Angels\\", a piano ballad which, although not as great as e.g. \\"This Woman's Work\\" at least allows her voice to be heard well enough and undisturbed by other factors, and this track also shows she's still got it.   - the sound quality on the album. Like heard on Director's Cut, she seems to be nowadays fond of a softer, analogue or even \\"muffled\\" effect in her recordings. Althoughthis is not so evident here as on Director's Cut, there is still the question, could these songs sound better if the end result would be a bit clearer or crispier? Snow and winter are, after all, associated with adjectives like clear, pure, crispy..., too.   - repetitiveness. It could be argued that a certain repetitiveness helps create the mood or the atmosphere of a song, but the repetition here amounts to numbing. Also, repetition is used where it certainly doesn't add to the atmosphere, like on Wild Man or the title track. A certain amount of further editing would have been welcome; e.g. the first title, Snowflake, feels too monotonous because despite the length of the track nothing much happens. This repetitiveness is also a dividing effect that works on some while others will find it offputting. However, a bit more inventiveness wouldn't have hurt matters.  - too melancholic. OK, of course the atmosphere of the album is intentional, but couldn't there be something joyful about snow and winter, as well? This could have given some welcome variation to the album, as well.  These initial problems aside, the album has its delightful moments. The title track shows some humour and quirkiness and it's my favourite track on the album. In it, Kate urges a professor named Joseph Yupik, played by Stephen Fry, to recite 50 words for snow and he comes up with imaginative and absurd names, urged by Kate to go on. Some of these are quite funny, but the funniest thing is to try to figure out why this recital is happening in the first place - are they trying to compete with the eskimos? This track shows signs of the mad Kate Bush of e.g. The Dreaming era (although the song itself is very different from anything on the said album). Also, the whimsical chorus is one of the better ones on the album.   Other strong points: Snowflake, despite the afore-mentioned monotousness, is a nice dialogue between a falling snowflake (performed by Kate's son Bertie) and a person trying to catchit (Kate herself). Lake Tahoe and Misty have their atmosphere and are material for repeated listenings. Snowed In... is a good duet and has at least a chorus you can remember afterwards, in contrast to some other tracks here where the melody is more abstract.   I've only listened to this album a few times and it might still grow on me; I certainly hope so, before I decide to put the album aside altogether, having grown wary of it.  A tie between two and three stars, but because I do love Kate, it's a three.
1849802742|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moHV8UP5O28BVP]]AND POLICY UNRAVELLED<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Some very distinguished contributors (27 in total) offer a range of perspectives on the breath and complexity of the high profile issue of State Aid at a crucial moment for the EU at the end of 2011.<br /><br />The handbook succeeds as an in-depth review of the most controversial and difficult areas of state aid law and the policy issues it raises. It's a book aimed at academics and practitioners alike throughout the 400 odd pages covering 18 main areas of interest.<br /><br />The editor's aim is to provide a modern snapshot of the way in which State aid has become a central aspect of EU integration, and also a major concern for national economic policy during the current economic downturn.<br /><br />What is particularly welcome is the established aim of the handbook to widen the discussion of State aid towards a critical and inter-disciplinary analysis of the way in which both law and policy have accommodated the demands of integration and the role expected from State intervention in competitive markets. Erika Szyszczak and the team have come up trumps with a modern comment on State aid and policy.  Thank you!
B005XN0SGU|5.0|This is a very good comic cbr/cbz viewer with a lot of great features. It doesn't have fancy page-turning animations or text zooming and such, but the level of customization more than makes up for that. It's very powerful, yet simple to use. For $3, it's a very well priced application. Highly recommended.<br /><br />*I think it's worth noting that there is a shareware version of this on other Android sites, but the recommended donation is $3 anyway, so it's really the same price as other sites. Support good software; pay for it!

B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|THE DEBT is the current version  of HA HOV written by Ido Rubenblum and writer/director Assaf Bernstein: their story and screen play were the nidus for the current version whch was revised and written by Matthew Vaughn, Jane Goldman Porter and directed by John Madden.<br /><br />The film opens at a gala party in Israel where Rachel Brenner (Helen Mirren) is being honored again for her role in ending the life of the infamous 'surgeon of Birkenau' who during WW II did heinous experiments on human beings in the camps of Birkinau, including being responsible for the death of Rachel's mother. But news arrives that at all old folks home in the Ukraine that the surgeon is still alive. We learn that the now retired Mossad secret agents Rachel (Helen Mirren) and Stefan (Tom Wilkinson) about their former colleague David (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) nee an explanation. Flash back to 1966 when the trio of  three Mossad agents (Rachel - played at the young age by Jessica Chastain, Stephan Gold (Marton Csokas)and  David Peretz (Sam Worthington) were  sent to capture the surgeon (Jesper Christensen) and erroneously allowed him to escape and promised each other to keep their secret, told the papers that he committed suicide. Rachel, Stefan and David decide they must complete their broken mission and go to the Ukraine, fine the surgeon and kill him. Stephan and David are not up to the task, so it is left to Rachel to finish their mission. The suspenseful hunt and chase is how the mission is accomplished.<br /><br />The manner in which the film is set into motion is a seamless interchange of the years 1944 during the war and the black and white images of the concentration camps, and 1965 when the three young Mossad agents captured the surgeon (and their interaction with him before his escape) and the present when the now 60ish Rachel carries out her duty. It is chilling, rich in character development, and maintains a degree of tension that is almost unbearable at times.

B005FI6IRG|5.0|A very new recording has arrived on the scene! Based on concerts presented in Spain and France countertenors Philippe Jaroussky and Max Emanuel Cencic have joined with William Christie and the Les Arts Florissants to produce this CD of duets written for countertenors.  The result is so satisfying that the recoding will likely be in the running for awards.<br /><br />As a bit of background for this venture, the booklet note explains `the `duetto da camera' was in part a response to the papal ban on opera in Rome in the early eighteenth century - and as the edict also forbade women from singing in public, the cantatas on this disc were necessarily written for castrati. Most of these works last around ten minutes and combine recitative dialogue with duet (the `duetto da camera') or with arias for each singer in turn (the `chamber duet'). Both are secular forms, typically setting a pastoral `nymphs-and-shepherds' text written by one or more of the scholars, amateur poets or even cardinals who attended `conversazione' (something akin to modern-day summer schools!) in Rome and Naples in order to exchange ideas and foster their appreciation of music and the other arts.'<br /><br />What follows is some of the most artistic singing of this era's music on CD. Cencic's voice has the darker timbre, with plenty of metallic bite throughout the registers, whilst Jaroussky is sweeter and more ethereal. Each gets a solo cantata (inevitably, in the persona of a shepherd) which plays to these strengths, Jaroussky's by Mancini (all limpid streams and flowery banks) and Cencic's by Porpora (listen to the thrilling bite in his voice in the final section as he sings of the savage beasts who threaten his flock).<br /><br />The pieces included here are as follows: Bononcini, G B  `Pietoso nume arcier', and `Chi d'Amor tra le catene'; Conti `Quando veggo un'usignolo'; Mancini `Quanto mai saria pi&ugrave; bello'; Marcello ``Chiaro e limpido fonte', and `Tirsi e Fileno'; Porpora `Ecco che il primo albore'; and Scarlatti `Amore e Virtu: Nel cor del cor mio'.<br /><br />The two voices blend so well, each countertenor surpassing in his own range, and Christie and his ensemble provide just the right embellishments. The result is a recording of rare beauty by two of the finest countertenors of our time.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|After reading another review of the movie I ordered it online right away. As mentioned in the review I read, it is a slow moving movie, which is why it will not hold most kids interest, but held the adults I shared it with to the screen. It is a great true story of \\"making things right\\" within family. I remember seeing this story in the news years ago when it actually happened. NOW I KNOW THE REASON FOR THE TRIP!!! The news story left you thinking this crazy old man was making a 400 mile trip on a riding mower because he was \\"crazy.\\" The movie reminds the viewer of the importance of family, comparing family to a bunch of sticks. That every person has value, and the importance to make things right. To understand what I just said you should ...watch the movie...
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|Today my son and I watched the Blu-ray version of Cars 2 from the 5 disk set. We had not seen the movie in the theaters so my review is mainly of the movie but I also talk about the Blu-ray quality. Overall I was a bit disappointed but let me give you the full 411.<br /><br />The animation is top notch. The colors on the Blue-Ray version were awesome. The graphics were super cool and very impressive. All of this did not make up for a weak story line however. The movie starts off with an unfamiliar cast of cars so it took me a couple of minutes to figure out what was happening. It turns out that we are watching a movie about alternative fuel. Only later does the new cast meet the cast of the first Cars movie. While I enjoyed the original line up and voices, it really seemed like Cars 2 should have been totally separate but needed to ride on the success of the first movie. The story tie in was weak and the Cars 2 movie could have been developed independently. I feel like this is a sequel in name only.<br /><br />I don't know who saw [[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E (Single-Disc Edition)]] or how you felt about it but I did not appreciate being lectured to by that movie about the ills of society, and I don't appreciate the social commentary here either. The message wasn't so pronounced that children would pick up on it but it overshadowed the story for me.I get it, as the movie says \\"once big oil, always big oil.\\"<br /><br />The movie did have some good lessons about friendship and the value of sticking by a friend and being loyal. I think this is what the kids will pick up on and that's a good lesson to learn. The voices are the same from the first movie and are generally entertaining. I think you kids will enjoy the animation and the action but more so for the under 7 crowd but there is a lot of cartoon violence with cars shooting at other cars trying to \\"kill\\" them. My son is ten and claims to have enjoyed this movie.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|I just bought it, I didn't need to listen to samples before.   Put it on in the car driving home in the dark.  Cold outside, end of november.  And listened until I came home.  Later in the evening, kids in bed, I put it on again.  And I let the blancket of songs cover me and relaxed.  If there is one cd that can sooth your longing for spring, this is it.   From the first note to the last you can feel the snow flakes hover down to earth, or drift around the house.  No matter the rythm of the song, snow is everywhere. The listener a spectator from inside, gazing in winter's marvelous - our dreading - aspect.  With the help of the sound engineer Kate's voice and piano blend pefectly.  Hear the silence between notes - as important as the notes themselves.   Just get this album now. Don't hesitate.   This is an instant masterpiece.

0060920084|3.0|I do not write many reviews, but I just completed this book and really felt the need to share my thoughts since the book was so much less than I expected.  And it seems like many others share my opinion.    This is the third Bill Bryson book. I have previously read \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" and \\"A Walk In The Woods.\\"  I doubt I would have read either of these if I read \\"the lost continent\\" first.  While there are some \\"laugh our loud? passages, I felt the book was mean spirited.  I understand this is a satire, but a good satire is not so negative. I suspect if Mr. Bryson was writing the book today, it would have the charm of his later books.

As other commentators have said, virtually everything is covered without having to carry 3 volumes of `Stones' with you (no disrespect to LexisNexis!)<br /><br />So, if you're a practitioner with a busy and highly pressured practice in the magistrates' courts, you need the new edition of `Blackstone's Magistrates' Court Handbook'.  It covers those offences which you are most likely to experience frequently in court and is therefore brilliant for helping you with those short notice cases which require your immediate and considered response.<br /><br />Many of your colleagues will have copies of the Handbook and if you have a copy already, do note that this is a brand new edition for 2012 containing the latest up to date material.<br /><br />It remains thoughtfully designed for ease of use and it's almost instantly navigable with a logical system of icons, frequent headings, bullet points, flow charts and tables -- particularly on sentencing topics -- and Extensive Tables of Cases, Legislation and Secondary Legislation.  As it comes in a handy pocket sized format with a (practically damage proof) and highly practical plasticated cover, you can keep it ever to hand in your briefcase.  If you don't have this latest edition now, buy it before the hordes descend!<br /><br />It'll certainly save you a lot of precious time, and, yes, Keogh has struck the correct balance here!

1849802602|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo35N8ZGFKBDXYT]]<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Micklitz's work bringing together 15 contributors (and himself) to produce a highly detailed, and rather long series of linked theses, but the many concepts sparkle when addressing the finer points of modern social justice theory.  It's a book primarily for academics and jurisprudents and very much a European book in keeping with the Edward Elgar stable of modern detailed legal works which will be of great interest to practitioners, covering so much of our case law as it does.<br /><br />The title examines the European model of social justice in private law which has developed during the 20th century. There are over 450 pages split into 5 parts and 18 chapters.  It is useful to read the introductory chapter by Professor Micklitz who sets the scene with the highly topical `social justice and access justice in private law'.<br /><br />Of particular interest to the practitioner is the final part covering the extent to which patterns of social justice are context related and where they differ when one views competition, consumer and labour/employment law.<br /><br />As with other Edward Elgar publications, including `More Common Ground for International Competition Law', the final chapter by Professor Cseres, entitled `Towards a European model of economic justice: the role of competition law' was particularly thoughtful and very much part of the EU so many of us have today.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|This movie does not disappoint. If you have been with the series long enough to make it to the 8th movie, then you will truly enjoy this awesome conclusion to a beloved series. There really isn't any more to say about that.<br /><br />The ONLY reason it has been rated so low is because of people who keep 'reviewing' it, some who have boldly stated that they, in fact, do *not* own it, and choose to rate it 1-3 stars because of the new UltraViolet digital copies. I understand their frustration, but find it more frustrating that it may cause others to simply see the amount of stars it has, bypass the reviews, and conclude that it must suck - when that is simply not true. To me, it is the same as any other product: if you don't like something about it, you either a) do not purchase it, or b) purchase it, and suck it up that it isn't as perfect as you want. Or in this case, wait until you can purchase the region-free bluray on Amazon's UK site (For those wishing to do that, you can do so at amazon.co.uk)when it releases December 2.<br /><br />Please stop down-rating an excellent movie because of one tiny factor, especially when you can purchase an alternative. Your trolling is annoying.
1849803943|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3GFLP1YL58WWF]]ON COMPETITION LAW DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE WORLD<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />It's always dangerous when you have a question in the title of the book, but it works here! Without doubt a heavy book reliant on substantial pre-knowledge of the subject matter, the 5 editors have brought together 17 contributors to set out how much common ground we actually have with international competition law... and it's more than you think.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful statement of approach which, as many commentators have said, will promote convergence rather than diversity dealing as it does with much highly topical material.  It is of great value to academics, and also to lawyers and economists.<br /><br />The four parts of the book cover the following areas: economic foundations of competition law; individual jurisdictions and international perspectives; intellectual property and competition law; and promoting competition policy nationally and across borders.<br /><br />It remains a daunting task for the 5 editors, Messrs Drexl, Grimes, Jones, Peritz and Swaine, who prove, in our view that a harmonious link by the variety of contributors can, and does produce here, that there is substantial ground for successful international competition law in the future... if there is the will!
B0065IBZI2|5.0|Luckily, snow has just started to fall in the Adirondacks this winter, providing an excellent setting for this gorgeous album. Thematically, Kate's lyrics are as inventive as always and sonically, she's at the top of her game. While the first three tracks are long, sprawling narratives, they're all as fragile and complex as a snowflake. Songs such as the title track and the single \\"Wild Man\\" pick up the pace, only to rest on the album's closing number \\"Among Angels\\"- a personal favorite. The art of the album isn't dead, but the world is moving too quickly. Relax with Kate and smile for awhile. Sending warmth and love! Happy Holidays!

And an almost infinite one too, unless you agree with Professor Cox that the universe will come to a dismal end seventy billion years from now, or whatever.  In the meantime, space initiatives should provide  an increasing and lucrative work load for lawyers and those of you who wish to think ahead and plan ahead in this area, should rush out and get `Contracting For Space' published by Ashgate.<br /><br />The book is an important contribution to the international law of contract concerning procurement of equipment and ancillary matters, largely within the EU.  A fascinating compilation of the publications of no less than forty learned contributors from the EU and overseas, this volume can be regarded as of the most valuable references on space law currently available, placing as it does, such an impressive accumulation of expertise at your fingertips.<br /><br />As one commentator has rightly said, it forms a coherent guide expertly put together by its erudite and expert editors Lesley Jane Smith and Ingo Baumann.  Here you can read the latest in developments and practice in space law and business specifically in Europe.  As Smith points out, `International space law is a part of public international law and developed over a relatively short space of time, largely in response to...Sputnick in 1957...[and therefore] requires a regulatory environment to govern activities taking place there.'<br /><br />As for the business and commercial spin-offs from space, these will likely prove to be almost as infinite as space itself, a reality reflected in EU space policy.  Space applications will inevitably support virtually everything from road, rail, air and maritime transport to systems, environmental issues and climate change.  Apart from the obvious military applications, think of medicine and medical technologies, mobile communications and navigation products, as well as products and services for domestic consumption -- to name only a few.<br /><br />The aim of the editors and their contributors is to examine in depth the complex legal framework that will result from this equally complex body of space-related activities.  Among a host of other matters, the book deals with legal issues specific to launchers, satellite manufacturers and space service providers, which will impact in turn, on those other issues of risk, liability and insurance, inherent in contractual arrangements.  Contract practice is of course as central to space activity as to any other -- hence the main focus of this excellent book, which also provides a wealth of resources for your further research.<br /><br />If you're a practitioner, or policy maker, or merely fascinated by space law, you definitely need a copy of `Contracting for Space.'

1451627289|4.0|\\"11-22-63\\" is a terrific read, and further evidence of King's skills as a storyteller composing literary fiction (in this case historical fiction).  The narrative, told in the 1st person by the main character, Jake Epping (aka George Amberson), is compelling and builds in intensity to become compulsive reading.  Taking on the subject of the most important event to occur in the 20th Century is a daunting task.  King wisely chooses to keep it simple by presenting the circumstances consistent with the \\"lone assassin theory\\" as promoted by the Warren Commission.  I happen to agree that it would have become too cumbersome for King to include the other forces necessary in a story that would have revealed a conspiracy.  By keeping things clear and focused, King is able to do what he does best: tell a great story, create memorable characters of real substance who the reader feels a personal connection to, and although it is a lengthy tale to tell, maintain a potent pace that keeps the reader fully absorbed until the climax of the novel.  These are no small feats, especially in the genre of historical fiction which, in lesser authorial hands, often becomes tedious and sometimes does not ring true.  My only quarrel with the book is the editorial-like Afterword, where King somehow feels it necessary to justify the \\"lone assassin\\" theory.  He fails to acknowledge that going with that presumption was necessary for the soundness of his novel's structure, and, furthermore, in a weak attempt to show that he was objective about the facts of the assassination, he cites a number of books that influenced his conclusions - only trouble is all of the before mentioned books are works that surmise that Oswald acted alone.  There is no mention of resources like the books \\"Crossfire,\\" and  \\"On The Trail of The Assassins,\\" or the BBC documentary where the surgeons who treated Kennedy in Dallas were interviewed and stated that the fatal gun-shot wound was created by a bullet that entered fromthe front of the President's head.  I suppose King's way of tossing a chip to conspiracy theory proponents is to insouciantly state that his wife sides with the conspiracy supposition.  Nevertheless, the novel is a triumph and will, no doubt, touch many people in many different ways.  Being drawn into King's superb accomplishment of brilliantly re-capturing how life was in the late 50's and early 60's as narrated by a character who is very much part of the 21st century, is reason enough to give credit where credit is due.

B0000041ZT|5.0|Quite a gret surprise this was,  I did not know what I was buying, I just got it because I knew Dimitri Shostakovich was a great Russian composer and I wanted to continue exploring his musical compositions.  Previously I have heard his 15 symphonies. By the way, is you are looking for strenght, you need to buy his Symphony #8.  This CD contains 16 great pieces, which include his Concerto #1 for Piano & trumpet.  for trumpet?  that is a clashy statement, who ever taught of such an idea, well Shostakovich did.   At times he gest violent with the piano and you figure he is going to break it, the end result is a great and unique composotion. In my opinion, he belongs to the strident Russians composers group I would say, by the way, there is no melancholic or sad song written by a Russian.  (the chairman or head of the Strident Russian composers is Igor Strakinky, that's for sure).  You can watch Shostakovich playing this Piano Concerto in YouTube.  All of the polkas and waltzes in this CD are absolutly great, at times he gets very playful with the xylophone, then you get confused because you don't know if you are listening to Dimitri Kabalevsky or Khachaturian.  the last song Tea for Two is fantastic.  There are times when you think you are listening to music from a Chaplin, Orson Wells, or Federico Fellini movie.  One thing is for sure, you must get this CD.

0307593312|2.0|As a fan of Murakami's earlier books I found his latest work disappointing. The plot borders on insipid. Despite the contrivances that Murakami introduces--Little People, the charismatic Leader, Dohtas, multiple moons--it is, in the end, a story of two people in love destined, for reasons unknown, to come together. The book is also unnecessarily long, filled with passages that don't advance our understanding of the characters or the strange world they are confronted with. A merciful editor would have tightened the story and reduced its length by half. I fear that Murakami is beginning to coast on his celebrity.

I also found the abrupt shifts in time a little jarring; one has to make sure to read the date for each chapter in order to keep up.

To write on such a grand scale, and yet to keep so many characters three dimensional is a testament to the writing skills of George RR Martin.

The final 40 pages that details Bond's escape from Dr. No are very exciting even though you know how it will turn out.  I look forward to my next Bond read.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|This is a great game. It is the third and 4th installment of the Might and Magic series. You have multiple gameplay options. You can play the campaign or pick from a large number of shorter scenarios. The game is fairly addictive. You think, \\"I'll just make one more move and quit.\\" but then you realize you just spent three more hours. It does not have great graphics but it more than makes up for it in game play as you can increase your hero's levels and shape how they develop. I highly recommend this game.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|second song is the best, consistent, best since Breakaway. She revels in the payback songs. My fav singer from American Idol.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|I'm a huge Kelly Clarkson fan and I own everything she has released.  While I looked forward to her latest effort, I can't say I'm in love with it.  I've listened to it for weeks now and have tried to get a feel for it.  I've tried to love it.  Some of it I do like very much (\\"The War Is Over,\\" \\"What Doesn't Kill You [Stronger]\\") and some of it I like okay (\\"Einstein,\\" \\"Mr. Know It All,\\" \\"Honestly,\\" \\"Don't You Wanna Stay\\").  For the most part, however, I feel like I've heard it all before and it was done better then.  Kelly still sounds great and I'd love to hear her perform live.  I'm just not wowed by #4. I'd give it 4 stars.
B005KELW26|4.0|This folio is perfect for the kindle fire and it is will build. It feels good on hand. I would recommend it to anyone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is highly dynamic and always a challenge. I thoroughly enjoy playing through level after level of this fun and stimulating game. Good stuff!
145551389X|5.0|The day UPS delivered the package, I was so excited. I love Lady Gaga and I feel as if I never know enough about her. This book is amazing. It's a real book. You can actually hold it in your hand and say you have a work of art from Lady Gaga and Terry Richardson. I want to get mine signed if I ever meet Gaga.   You can't put a price on art. This book was well worth the money and I will have it for the rest of my life. It has hundreds of high quality pictures that capture Gaga in all of her moments. You almost feel as if you are the photographer when you are looking at the pictures. You can kind of tell Terry liked taking pics of her ass, but who in their right mind could say Lady Gaga doesn't have a nice ass?   In Gaga's youtube video, one of the passages from the book that she narrates is when Terry catches her in bed at 4am and says something to the matter of (Snap...*giggle*.Snap.Snap.Snap..Beautiful.) Once you uncover the portion of the book where Gaga is woken up by Terry, you can create a perfect mental picture of that scenario in your head. This book is probably the closest to real life you will ever get with Gaga.   Pros:   Lots of Pictures  Beautiful Photography  Reveals things about Gaga that you never knew before.  It's like real life.   There are pictures of Gaga that will show her true beauty that she wants us to see.   Nothing is off limits.   Cons:  You will want to see more. You will be left wishing you worked with Lady Gaga herself and that you could be her closest friend.

B002ZG999U|5.0|I think the Expendables was a outstanding movie. A lot of action and a throwback to the 1980's.
B000002PCS|5.0|My girl friend loves this movie. It's a total chick flick. I got it for her and pretended to like it so I would get lucky.  It worked great!!  I highly recommend this movie......scott
B004RCUJ9E|3.0|Looks okay and seems fun at first... Truly needs multi player option though to give it legs.  Playing the computer is just boring. Lasted 3 days then uninstalled.
0143118706|5.0|I find that people have a tendency to either love Elizabeth Gilbert's work, or they hate it.  I fall into the former category.  I've read all of her books; Committed is my second favorite behind Eat, Pray, Love.  I love her introspective story telling, the great lengths she goes into researching facts and exploring her own past to make informative decisions and how she takes you along during the entire process.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed EPL.
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|Maybe I'm in the minority here who finds \\"American Horror Story\\" absolutely repulsive or else I'm the only one who's willing to write about it. I have been shocked lately at what I've seen appear on the FX channel. I'm convinced this channel prides itself on being the most tasteless & morally bankrupt of all cable channels. At best this show is borderline pornographic with elements of \\"torture porn,\\" a concept that has experienced a resurgence of popularity lately.<br /><br />Maybe I am a tad on the prudish side but I think this show is just trying to capitalize on shock tactics by taking everything taboo to such extremes that it makes me feel downright embarrassed to watch it. TV shows should entertain me not make me cringe. Every element is depicted so graphically that there is no room left to use one's imagination. When it comes to being scared by a movie or tv show, many times what is left to the viewer's imagination becomes scarier than what is actually depicted. Here everything is graphically displayed in over-the-top images that leave one feeling disturbed, disgusted, dejected.<br /><br />I cannot think of a show that places more emphasis on sex (a perverted distorted kind) in combination with intense violent images including S & M tones and topped off with some language, though the language is the least of the problems. I truly think the creators/writers/producers of this show are merely relying on shocking the audience to keep its members tuned in.<br /><br />I wish this show would focus on scaring us instead of shocking us. There is a big difference between terrifying/ horrifying and plain old shocking. If this show's primary goal is to provide a way for the audience to feel frightened, then it overshoots is mark and instead repels and repulses rather than draws us in by being seductively thrilling. We aren't just taunted here, we are bludgeoned. This is a shame because the premise is so great- the setting of a haunted mansion with all kinds of ghosts andforces of darkness provides a limitless source of thrills, chills and spills. Don't get me wrong here- I love a good scare. But all those things are graphically exploited ad nauseum. It's almost a gore-fest. Even the title/opening sequence is a sick bloodfest similar to the \\"True Blood\\" opener (and that's nothing to be proud of.)<br /><br />I have never thought it enjoyable to watch graphic sex and, besides the stereotype in slasher flicks to have casual sex run rampant within, there really is no need to contain so much here. I have always thought watching two people have sex is like watching someone take a huge crap. (It seems so voyeuristic- (sp?) I mean do most people make it a point to sit and watch their friends or family members engaging in sexual intercourse? Does it become acceptable if it's on a tv show?) I'm not sure what part sex plays in chilling scare-you-to-death movies other than, as I said above, it seems to be a key ingredient without which no slasher flick is complete. Okay, if it must be in there then fine, but does it have to turn into a huge pork-fest where people are humping each other's brains out?<br /><br />Even worse is the combination of the borderline porn and the vulgar gore. Seeing a man get a chimney poker shoved up his rectum by a leather-and-chain-clad figure is totally sick. This show is obviously going for the gross-out and leaving no bases uncovered. I think it must be a contest on the FX channel to see which show can morally offend the most people. \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" and \\"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\\" as well as \\"Anger Management\\" and even at times \\"The League\\" (though I admit that one does make me laugh at times, once I've endured all the masturbation jokes and the actual masturbation scenes) all seem to be in contention for who can be the most morally bankrupt.<br /><br />Anyway, this show could have been cool but overdoes it with its wretched excess that's in-your-face and over-the-top. I wish creators would subscribe to the belief that subtle is better and less is more. Let our minds be stimulated to imagine the rest...
0143038419|5.0|I picked up this book after seeing an interview of Elizabeth Gilbert on Oprah where she seemed to be able to clearly and completely articulate a lot of complex feelings and thoughts that modern women have.  I was surprised by how much I identified with the book and it is one of my all time favorites.  I also would like to note that - this book was so much better than the movie.
B005V20JKI|1.0|This game has no point at all. On top of being a pointless game the controls are terrible. Unless you want to waste your time don't bother with this game!!
B000FS9FC6|4.0|I purchased this for Christmas..but was in good comndition and delivered in a timely mannerso it was fine but not yet opened or played.
B0057RCFQS|4.0|These films are classics. The set is great and the specials are worth the cost. I definitely recommend this to  Spielberg and SciFi fans.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|They make a video in Brazil and have some portuguese words in it.  Why would they not make the video available in Portuguese.  I can only find it in English and Spanish.  Doesn't make any sense. Other than that the movie was wonderful and colorful. Lots of action for a kids movie.  Well worth the money.  More 3d dvd's should be available without the 5 dvd pack.  Some people only want 1 3d dvd not 5 dvd's
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is another great Stephen King novel.  You probably already know about the plot if you're reading this - guy finds a way to go back in time to 1958 and decides to try and stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK.  The idea is pretty straightforward, but actually carrying out the task is harder than expected.  The past doesn't want to be changed, Oswald may not have acted alone, and killing a man doesn't come naturally to high school English teachers.<br /><br />This book sucks you in from the beginning.  King wastes no time in getting to the meat of the story, and of course what starts with a really simple premise gets complicated and developed over the course of the book.  The ending is pretty bizarre, but it's a good ending, something King sometimes struggles with.  I was worried going in that King's politics would seep into the writing, and I hate it when writers can't resist putting their opinions in a work of fiction.  Despite the fact that the premise of the story is ripe for all sorts of political jabs, King avoids the political side of things except for one or two small, easily overlooked comments.  There's no heavy-handed partisan politics like in Under the Dome, thankfully.<br /><br />Overall, 11/22/63 is yet another well done King classic.  I'd also say that this is a great King starter book, if you have a friend who doesn't mind an entertaining, thick read but is hesitant to read King because he's best known for horror.  All around a great book.
B000LT2IHI|5.0|My Grandson loved this toy.  He couldn't stop playing with it, and even to this day, this is one of his favorite toys.  He is developing his motor skills by playing with this toy.  The colors are fantastic!
044024367X|3.0|I didn't find this book as interesting as most of the previous books in the series. It lacked some of the Jack Reacher insight and cleverness seen previously. Is Jack Reacher getting too old and loosing his touch?? The next few books in the series might answer that question for me...
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Great GREAT movie. This is one of the thousands of protest ratings due to the incredible insult to consumers by the braindead movie executives. NOT a digital copy - this is a stream service and it is CRAP! Burn your own or pirate it. FAIL. GIVE US THE DIGITAL COPY WE PAID FOR!
1400052181|5.0|Good book.  Will keep your interest.  Had lively discussions at book club review.  Book arrived in good, new condition.  Good price.
B003L77G8I|5.0|The sixth season of BONES provides long-time fans of the series with more of what we love; all of the episodes, to be sure, but the special features are as entertaining as ever, and the overall quality is exceptional even in the \\"regular\\" version (for those of us dinosaurs who have yet to surrender to the Blu-Ray world)! Looking forward to next year's copy already.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This is a great cd. Love his voice and this has all of his good songs. Would recommend to all.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|This product arrived quickly and was as advertised. No surprises there. It was a gift. No problems. Haven't even watched it yet.
B000T0XEGS|5.0|Franco Zefferelli's 'movie' version of one of Verdi's better operas is one of the most accessible productions available.  Many people who do not appreciate or regularly listen to grand opera are titillated by the movie format and, once beginning the viewing of the story, are unable resist the plot and the beautiful music.  My daughters, many years ago when they were in grade school, got their introduction to this premiere art form from a VHS version of this piece, and still remember and talk about it.  The acting by Placido Domingo, Teresa Stratas, and Cornell MacNeil is very believable and smooth.  The movie does not contain all of the dialogue in the libretto, but the concept of the story and Verdi's music make this a wonderful first opera for nearly anyone.
B001R60ESE|5.0|One of the warmest entertainers out there bar none.<br />His interaction with the audience is  phenomenal having seen him three times live this Blu-ray is as good as being there.<br />Wonderful guest lineup Stpehen Tyler (at his best),Sting, Josh Grobin Yo Yo Ma.Steve Whitmore and the many more I have missed.<br />Sy Smith was introduced to me here at a concert in Vancouver this girl can sing!<br />Out of 100 Blu-ray concerts I have this would have to be in the top three !!!<br />Juist a first rate effort and experience
B002LVUKIS|4.0|Nice games but only one of them works on Windows 7 (Dark Shadows) .  This game keeps my going for hours.
0385534639|5.0|I read the reviews of The Night Circus before making the hardbound purchase.  It was worth every penney.  I was taken away into the world of the glamour and mystery of the fantasy tents and all the images that were provided.  In reality, I might not have been as brave to venture into some of the \\"unknown\\" areas.  I was intrigued by the weatlth of characters and the personalities of all of them. The storylines were solid and inviting.  I know it is a book that I will reread again and discover more in this fantasy world!
B005V20JKI|5.0|Got this App when it was free. Awesome download.  Definitely worth its retail price of $2.99. This app is a must for the kindle fire!
B005TQAI6G|4.0|My musical taste generally leans towards indie-music, but I always appreciate great \\"pop\\" and Britney Spears' latest CD \\"Femme Fatale\\" has been one of the most unexpected surprises for me this year, a fantastic guilty pleasure if you want. I caught the \\"Femme Fatale\\" tour in Columbus here in Ohio this past August, and it was a fantastic show, period. The never-ending debate about whether Britney lip-syncs or not is totally besides the point, as far as I'm concerned, you go to the show to experience the totallity of it. So when I saw this DVD/CD deluxe edition at a big-box retailer the other day, I just had to pick it up.<br /><br />\\"Britney Spears Live: the Femme Fatale Tour\\" (DVD; 86 min.) brings her show from Toronto, and it was exactly the same set I saw in Columbus. The set list is heavy on \\"Femme Fatale\\", which is a great thing, as I happen to think it is Britney's best album, period. For me this DVD is simply a great memento of a fun show I saw a few months ago. But truth be told, I would not have bought this but for the enticing bonus CD that came with this.<br /><br />The bonus CD (10 tracks; 56 min.) brings a great collection of remixes and one new track. There are three remixes of each \\"Would You Hold It Against Me\\", \\"Till The World Ends\\" and \\"I Wanna Go\\", and while you may think that is overkill, in fact those remixes are quite nice, never unrecognizable from the origial track, but done creatively in a way that I'm enjoying those songs in a new way. There is one new track, \\"Scary\\", which would've fitted very nicely onto the \\"Femme Fatale\\" album proper. In all, I am very pleased with this deluxe edition, which is available at a big-box retailer for just a few more dollars.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I buy this series, one for myself and one for my mom. We both love it, and always makes a great gift. Perfect condition.
B000CBUSWW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie years ago and have wanted to add it to my collection. Difficult to find at a reasonable price especially in a DVD format. Finally decided to purchase the VHS format. Watched the movie the day I received it and enjoyed it again. Historical content seemed very accurate.
B0052GACNM|5.0|He just keeps getting better.  We love the album.  He combines old traditional favorites with some newer  artists and  I'm sure they are honored to duet with him.
1423140591|5.0|My son has been waiting for months for this book to be released and when it finally was, we couldn't find it anywhere in the stores.  This was an easy transaction and he was so thrilled when it came.  The book was finished within a couple of days and was completely worth it!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I am not a jazz fan, but really enjoy this Christmas CD.  Reminds me a lot of the Christmas music I heard as a child.
B005IZLPME|5.0|The story is good and so is the action. It's nice that there are still movies where the bad guys are truly bad (as opposed to \\"misunderstood\\") and the good guys are truly good (Captain America fights for his friends and his country.) The special effects don't feel too \\"cartoony\\" either. Another good thing is that the director remembered that he was filming in 3D when he framed each shot. That way, you get the thrill of having things leap off the screen at you, as opposed to some 3D movies where things which should have come off the screen just fall out of the shot to the side instead. Why film it in 3D if you're going to make it look flat? (Watch \\"Tron Legacy\\" in 3D and you'll see what I mean.)
B0058YPG1G|3.0|I just bought Season 1 of Breaking Bad and have yet to watch it. I hope this series lives up to all the hype I have heard about it. The finest t.v. series I have viewed in the last 12 years our The Sopranos, Deadwood and The Wire. For my money, The Wire is the very best t.v. series ever made. Who knows, after I have finished watching all 4 seasons of Breaking Bad I might be willing to change my mind. I have heard from friends that The Shield is one of the most excellent cop t.v. series ever done, and even though I have only seen a few programs from this FX series, I'll say this much, it does hold your attention very well.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It didn't look like much when I first bought it, but it's growing on me. I bought it when it  was 39.99 and thought it was a bit overpriced, but amazon credited me $10 when the price changed to 29.99. I didn't even have to contact them, they did it automatically.  I think the stand is just \\"okay\\". I think they could maybe improve on that.
B000W746GK|5.0|It's a great movie. I have all of the Harry Potter movies.  These are a must see for all age groups.
