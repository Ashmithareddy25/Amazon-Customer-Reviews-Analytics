B005FHXB0O|1.0|Its just not a good movie and was not worth the $3 dollars that it cost. Me and my husband were highly disappointed.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Awesome game! So glad it finally showed up on Kindle HD. Highly recommend this game. So cool. Totally worth buying!
B00005JH7D|4.0|I thought this CD would be better but it still has some good tracks such as the cover of Burning Down the House by Talking Heads.
B0013TTLDE|2.0|Could not get into this book.It was recommended at my book club.In all fairness, I am a modern mystery reader, however I do appreciate a good historical novel, but this book did not keep my interest.
B00464AVXW|4.0|Seven is an ugly movie.  It is a horror movie written, seemingly by an out-of-work, over educated English major.<br /><br />The story follows two detectives who work in a declining, rust-belt city.  They come to investigate a series of crimes perpetuated by a stereotypically, super-smart serial killer.  This killer is selecting victims based on the seven deadly sins.<br /><br />There is a plot twist-the final victim is the serial killer himself killed by the wrath (one of the seven deadlies) of a detective.<br /><br />Indeed the movie is ugly, and it shows a clear accounting of the decay in America in the 1990s.
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|OMG, We just LOVED this movie!  I am sure we will watch it over and over for many years to come!  Would recommend it to everyone over the age of 14.......it has it's gruesome moments, but worth closing your eyes to see the rest of the movie!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|very simple to set up and easy to use. I cannot believe how easy it is to print from my nexus 7 tablet.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|This was a very good rendition of the 'Robin Hood' movies, but I didn't like it quite as much as the one with Kevin Costner in it.  But, yes, we will again, watch it over many times!
B004LROUW2|4.0|This was my first exposure to Murakami's fiction, having read his book &#34;about&#34; running. I found it very engaging in the beginning, and sustained my interest through to the end. However, it also felt like there were a lot of loose threads left behind, and I was a little freaked out about the children/sex stuff.  If you are at all sensitive to that, you might want to steer clear.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Okay, THIS was the best of them all, as far as we are concerned!  It is both funny and serious, and seems to stick to the original theme of the RB movies.  I believe that everyone over 5 years old would get something from this movie!
B009UZLRJE|5.0|great dvd set and great condition. this makes watching our favorite show much easier. thank you for your item :)
B00947N6D8|5.0|Because I am a 64-year-old 'kid at heart', I absolutely LOVE this movie.  My husband............not so much, but he will suffer through it with me once in a while!
B002X6PTH8|5.0|had this movie on vhs when i was younger and i loved it then and i love it now.<br />Jim Carrey is hilarious, great musical content with cuban pete and his dance scene in the coco bongo and milo is adorable!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book started out as a fast past bundle of angst and new scenery, which made it really hard to put down. I enjoyed it, even the ending which was horribly heartbreaking.  I would have liked something warmer, the same happy ending every book has, but I didn't get it. Doesn't make it a bad book,  just makes it different.  I need to go hug someone though after reading it and try to cheer myself up.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, Mr. Clancy's cyberwar tome keeps one up late at night to learn what nefarious efforts the enemy is plotting. Another good read. Can't wait until his final volume is out.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|You just can't stop watching this show! I'm trying to get through the next few season as fast as I can.
0345529057|5.0|I love this series and purchased the box set to read after watching the first season on DVD. The books are way better than the HBO series. Item arrived on time as described.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|One of the original Kindle users, I convinced myself to load the Kindle App onto my Droid. 4 attempts to download and the same results each time:<br /><br />Took over an hour to download, even with Wi-Fi;<br />Slows every other function on the phone to a slow crawl;<br />Never gives me more than the opening &#34;Kindle&#34; faceplate;<br />Requires a force close and deletion to get my phone back to it's initial state.<br /><br />I realize others are happy with their Kindle phone applications. Perhaps my difficulties stem from the brand of phone I use. I wish it worked. Many times I like to travel light and the ability to read my current reads would be nice.
B00DEFW998|5.0|For anyone who has followed Anoushka Shankar's career it seems evident that she has improved with each album. Going from higly talented to one of the planet's greatest musicians.<br /><br />A strong composer, an excellent sitarist with a beautiful tone and most importantly an artist with a strong vision. Making a near perfect blend of East and West.<br /><br />On this album she has cooperated with Nitin Sawhney on most tracks. And come up with a nice very diverse musical adventure. Most of the tracks are instrumentals with a few mantras shown in and really making Indian music that should appeal to a wide audience. And a young audience too. Music that is completely contemporary and at the same time made with deep reverence to the tradition.<br /><br />Maybe the biggest attraction for most listeners is the fact that half-sister Norah Jones lends her husky voice to three of the tracks.<br /><br />Visionary and accesible world music at its best.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved The Shining so very long ago.  Reading about that little boy after he has grown up and his &#34;shining&#34; abilities a true spellbinder! not only frightening? Enjoying every page.
1609611543|5.0|I was very skeptical when I ordered this book--but I read it and started following the instructions in the book--WOW in 4 weeks I've lost 20 pounds and haven't been hungry, tired or craving things that aren't good for me--I'm not a health nut just someone who was fed up with gaining weight, feeling hungry all the time and having other issues that I didn't want to take medication for.  I recommend this book for anyone one trying to feel better and get healthy! It's an eye opener

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|The Black Eagle Inn (The Three Nations Trilogy) by Author Christoph Fischer<br /><br />Talented Author Christoph Fischer has done it again! This is the second historical fictional novel that I have read and reviewed in this epic Trilogy Series and it did not disappoint. Reading a book by this author is like visiting a cherished, reliable, and trusted friend. The reader knows exactly what to expect and Author Christoph Fischer delivers each and every time.  His endearing style of putting pen to paper warms the heart with its charming desire to educate, entertain, and captivate the most discerning readers.<br /><br />He meticulously draws his readers into the story line with a very soft and gentle approach. In \\"The Black Eagle Inn\\" we are hypnotically tantalized by the life of Anna Stockman, nee Hinterberger, and her strong and ambitious personality. She is determined to be the heiress to her family's successful restaurant business and adjacent farm. She succeeds in outsmarting her brother by picking away at his self-confidence and then expertly cons her father into  choosing her to ensure the legacy of their family business. After taking over, Anna manages to make her mark in the sleepy Bavarian town of Heimkirchen.<br /><br />She seems untouched by the warring country around her but feels its sting nonetheless when her prisoner-of-war husband, Herbert, unexpectedly returns when the war is over. Anna is a far cry from pleased to see him and finds her plans to name an heir to her fortune are being foiled by her now angry and moody husband. With no children of their own, Anna has been diligently keeping an eye open for her successor in this family business and adopts the son of her older brother. Markus, her golden boy is nowhere near as pleasing to her husband as the quick-minded Lukas, son of Han-Ulrich her younger brother. With his innate aptitude for numbers, he is chosen to mind the books. Herbert smells a rat when it comes to Markus' accounting and soon realizes that Anna is covering up for him. Little does Anna know that Herbert it spot on and her nephew is \\"cooking the books\\" and leading a secretive double life which has yet to unfold. On the other hand, Lukas who appears to be righteous and loyal has a hidden agenda of his own.  The vast cast of characters in this fictional family epic never cease to amaze me with their duplicity, greed, ambition, and thirst for power and wealth...but then there is Anna's niece, Maria. Could she be the breath of fresh air that this feuding family so desperately needs?<br /><br />What an incredible story laced with historical truths to give it both authenticity and believability. Author Christoph Fischer is definitely a gifted raconteur as he spellbindingly pens his captivating plot and mesmerizes his reading audience. Very enjoyable indeed!<br /><br />Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte<br />[[ASIN:B00EGPIZS4 I'm Not Perfect and It's Okay]]that Anna is covering up for him.

B00DIJQAI6|5.0|Awesome gameplay, good visuals and enough characters from the console game to please the biggest Sonic fans. My 4 year old loves Sonic &amp; this game is no exception. The only warning is be prepared for a painful download experience. Other than that the game is fast and no lock ups.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Knowing that this was a real event and a true story just brought me to tears.  Naomi Watts should have won an award for this movie.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app is  WONDERFUL!!!  I use this app all the time.  Helps with my instant research on my tablet.  The best app I ever downloaded. It's FREE, fast to download and easy to navigate to the scriptures.  Thanks to Jehovah and all the hard work the brothers put into giving us a clear and accurate translation of God's word.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Hmmmm... Glad that I rented it and did not go to the theatres, the idea is pretty interesting and the special effects were great, but the character development and storyline was lacking, as well as the acting. Good for  movie night while you are getting work done on your laptop, but not a great sit down and curl up by the TV with loved ones blockbuster
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to finally have this game on my Kindle Fire HD!  No more playing on my smart phone.  I love it.  Beware, it's addictive.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Mitchell does a great job of juggling the multiple character voices and plot lines but the &#34;nested&#34; story gimmick wasn't nearly as connected or interesting as I would have hoped.  Still, an interesting read and a great example of non-linear plotting.
0810988232|5.0|My Mom get a set and did readings for me and I am so happy that I got my own. I love these cards. The readings are always accurate and they are just so beautiful to look at.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|If you have a good amount of patience then you'll like this game! It's a fun game so far :)
B005K8QIS0|4.0|Thought the acting was good and loved how the stories intertwined. The area Jackson lives in seems small enough for that to happen.  I loved the scenery of this area of Scotland. I'm going to read the books now.  I hope this is not the end of seeing Jason Issacs as Brody.  Hope there are more books to continue the series.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I love It hi. I'm Leanne and I'm in middle school and this is the best book ever you should read it!!
0345803485|3.0|This is more erotica than romance in my humble opinion.  Kinky sex throughout if that is what you are looking for.  I wanted to compare this to something I'm working on myself and know completely now what I am writing is nothing like this.  After some of the shock wore off it became almost funny to read since I'm not at all shy or judgmental.  Some people reviewed this very low like with 1 star and I don't agree it is like a book written by a 13 year old.  Some people had to really love it for it to sell 70 million books and perhaps become a move.  It is a very fast read since it is so unusual.  If you want a variety of ways to think about sex it can certainly give you that.  I doubt I'll read any more of the Trilogy but one thing for sure, sex sells!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|its a great show. only gets better. season 2 and 3 are also really good. its a shame season 3 isnt up yet
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Very good writing and an interesting story. Shades of &#34;Dexter&#34;! Good for Book Club discussion.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Although I am a retired IT professional I still use technical utilities and this one is handy for troubleshooting network problems that friends are always asking me to do.  If I had to compare this app to those I used in the past I would say that it holds its own against Ipswitch's WS_PING that was my constand companion.<br /><br />I use this to mainly ping connections to see of they are alive, as well as use those statistics and the time and hop information from traceroute to spot problems. Most of the time it's a weak signal or damaged cable,  but sometimes it's obstructions to signal strength in the case of WiFi.<br /><br />This is not a cure all application, and it does require some technical knowledge. But of you have a basic understanding of networks you can accomplish some quick troubleshooting that will point you in the direction of what you need to check to find root causes.<br /><br />Since this works on my phone (in my case it's a Samsung Galaxy Note II running Jellybean 4.1.2) it's always handy. In the past I needed my laptop to perform the same tests I can do right from my phone.<br /><br />The product description says it will integrate with and launch application layer protocols like ftp and telnet - and it will. You do need to have those installed though because they are not bundled.<br /><br />One other useful function this app provides is to map a network. I was surprised to see a device called Azurewave Technologies show up on my network. A little sleuthing and it turned out to be my [[ASIN:B00DR0PDNE Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player]].<br /><br />Bottom line: this is very useful for first level network troubleshooting. I find myself using it more often than I anticipated and, frankly, every tech should have this installed on his or her Android phone or tablet - or both.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Another great read from the jack Reacher series. Wishing there were a heap more. But unfortunately getting to the end.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|This review could stand as my testament to every single Pet Shop Boys album ever made. The Boys are the most reliable songwriting team since Lennon & McCartney. Truly, they continue to deliver beautiful and interesting music that always manages to move and groove its listeners. Neil and Chris age like fine wine, but the music itself is simply timeless. Each and every song evokes its very own atmosphere, taking us away into its story. And as pop as the music is, it somehow transcends everything that is superficial about pop music. The Pet Shop Boys' discography, especially including this latest masterpiece, Electric, is as deep as it is shallow. To put it bluntly- it's the best pop music ever written!
B009477BOI|5.0|I loved this as a kid and now it is in regular rotation with my son, He absolutely loves it!
B0015AARJI|4.0|I, like many of you, have gone through countless controllers from numerous versions of consoles over the years.  Buttons fail, batteries die, and the controller becomes unusable.<br /><br />Thankfully, this PS3 controller was built a bit better than those older controllers.  I've had these two controllers for well over 4 years now and everything still works fine.  Battery charge is still acceptable (I use the Energizer two-remote charger, also located here on Amazon) and doesn't seem to drain very fast.  The buttons and analog sticks are still tight and function as expected.  Add to the fact that this remote works through Bluetooth and you have a fairly nice package.  No wires to fuss with and nothing to fray (or gnawed on by your pet).<br /><br />The controller itself, however, isn't the most comfortable over long periods of time.  Yes, it is better than the big and bulky XBOX controller - sorry for you XBOX controller fans - that thing is the size of a brick.  This controller, however, slowly becomes uncomfortable as you hold it.  I find myself shaking one hand or the other out during gameplay as my fingers begin to tense up.  I'm not saying it is a bad design - just not ergonomic for the long gaming sessions.  I'm not sure how they could make it better - but I am holding out hope that the PS4 controller is better to hold for extended periods.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this remote vs some of the cheaper 3rd party remotes, as it works and works well without any issue.  I've not always said that in the past for other gaming consoles (I have owned numerous 3rd party remotes, as the one released with the gaming console was inferior) but can say that Sony came up with a reliable and useful remote that isn't designed to fail after some use.  That being said - these are a bit more expensive than 3rd party remotes, but as the saying goes - you get what you pay for.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I hate the way she wrote this one. I love the first two, even went so far as to personally recommend them to people. I've waited for weeks for this, and now on chapter six, I realize I don't think I want to finish this book. WHY in the world is it split between the characters? It's so confusing to read this way, and doesn't at all follow the structure for the first two books. This isn't Game of Thrones, it shouldn't have been split into character-based chapters. The story line starts out from a complete 180 of where it left off in Divergent, where - again, inexplicably - Tris and Tobias are at odds. I'm wondering if I hyped this up in my mind and since it didn't reach my expectations, that's why I hate it.  Either way, I'm completely disappointed.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/18/2013: It took me almost a month to finish this book. The others I finished in one day - and this awful, poorly written thing took me a month to muster the patience and swallow my frustrations to finish. I won't post spoilers, I won't rip it apart page by page, but I sincerely hope if this film franchise ends up being a trilogy, they stray far, far from this book in particular.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|As usual I'm sad the series is at an end but it was really wrapped up wonderfully....and I had no idea what was coming.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Very entertaining and thought-provoking. Could spend all day playing it. Characters are real and enjoyable as well as &quot; Bones&quot; y.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|Surprisingly I found a story line in this movie behind the sci-fi. Not a believable concept but  it is sci-fi.  I like movies that entertain me sometimes without having a moral code of having to think too deeply. Just a sit back and watch. That is what you get here. You'll either love being entertained or hate the concept altogether.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|Our kids love this movie ... mum and dad didn't think it was too bad either as a family movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|You need to take a a great product and click on the amazing thing that you can see how to play.
1400067820|5.0|This is an extremely interesting and really thought-provoking book!  It's a bit of a mental workout, but well worth the trouble.
B000JO9JHW|4.0|The first season had me intrigued to see more. I will definitely keep watching to see how the characters develop.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved the history, elegance of the era, contrast of social class position, setting, clothing, speech, and the  story is pretty engaging as well.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really enjoyed the other two books, I felt the heartbreak and pain that came with making difficult choices for our characters. Both of the books were different from other YA books out there and seemed refreshing. I was excited to finally get my hands on Allegiant but now I am disappointed and frustrated with the author.  Perhaps I put to much pressure on this book but I had hoped for more than cliche. I mean really, this book was Insurgent set in a different location and the ending leaves much to be desired.  There were times when it would switch first person views in the middle of a chapter with no warning and then switch back. Needless to say I will not be reading this book again, it left more questions than answers, was obviously rushed through. I can read Insurgent, have a little better ending and still have the same questions I have now.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|A great series worthy of your time.  Good acting and engaging stories make this an enjoyable sci-fi adventure.  My favorite episode is Jamestown.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|Packaging was new condition.<br />No missing pieces.<br />Received product a few days earlier than expected.<br /><br />Was having a difficult time finding the LEGO Thor figure locally...so, worked out great!<br /><br />And it's LEGO.......everybody loves LEGO!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini just gets better and better.The story is beautifully written and held my attention from page 1.  He is a&#34; not to miss&#34; author who made me feel in the presence of the events.  If you are an avid reader and love words strung together in a meaningful and harmonious way you will love this book.  I can't wait for more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Surpasses my greatest expectations!  Works good and is not obtrusive.  It is a great addition to my theater room. Thanks
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I like this movie because it have a lot of action in it,and great actors. I will recommoned to friends and family.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Cassia, Ky, and Xander are back in this sequel to Ally Condie's book Matched. But there is a slight twist from the first book. This second is written from two points of view. Cassia's and Ky's.<br /><br />We start off with Ky. After being taken from the Borough by the Society near the end of the first book, we find that he is now in the Outer Provinces. He is one of many &#34;decoys,&#34; people living in towns to trick the Society's Enemy into thinking those towns are truly inhabited. They are told to plant cotton, to give the impression of a flourishing community. But all that comes is fire. Fire rains down on these &#34;decoys&#34; bringing death and destruction. Ky is the strongest of some of these &#34;decoys.&#34; He bands together with another boy, to bury the dead. However, he cannot forget Cassia no matter how bad it gets where he is. She is the light in his darkness, Her memory gives him the strength to run away, with two others, from the decoy town and into the unrelenting wilderness of The Carving. A place that will bring back memories, both good and bad, of his past.<br /><br />Cassia is on a search to find Ky. She cannot let him go without finding him again. So, with some cunning tactics, she lands a spot on an airship traveling to the Outer Provinces. This ship is taking a fresh band of &#34;decoys&#34; to a town, to replace those who are dead. Once there, Cassia searches desperately for any sign of Ky. But to no avail. He is not there. However, she soon comes across someone who knew of where he ran to. Someone who longs to also run.<br /><br />With the help of a newfound friend, Cassia heads to The Carving herself to find any sign of the boy she loves.<br /><br />Along this journey, though, she may find more than she bargained for.<br /><br />As for Xander, we find he is still in love with Cassia. But, as her search for Ky becomes more and more a part of her, how long will his one-sided love last?<br /><br />I loved the point of view thing in this book. It was a fresh take on the story, giving us a chance to know Ky better. More of his story was told in this one, which I really thought was great. He is still a mystery, but not so much as he was in Matched.<br /><br />Xander...let's now talk about him. I have a feeling that there is more to come from him in the third book. There's just something about him that halfway makes me not trust him.<br />*puts hands around face defensively* Sorry for those of you who like him, I think he is a nice guy, I just don't trust him.<br /><br />Overall, this book was good. I just probably would have benefited better if I would have reread the first book to refresh my memory. CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE THIRD IN THE SERIES!

B001NA6096|2.0|So so. This felt too formulaic for me. Dialogue a bit stilted and then sometimes flowed well...but spotty and uneven.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Characters are intriguing and each week the plot keeps moving.  Just finished Season 1 and starting Season 2.  Having the entire season's shows available is addicting.  Always looking forward to the next show.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I highly recommend this book. It is very inspirational and motivational type of book. Once you read it, you will find yourself referencing back.

0679745203|5.0|Years after I first read this book, The English Patient remains one of my all-time favorites. Michael Ondaatje is a true poet as he weaves together the stories of his characters with World War II as a grisly backdrop and stark contrast to the elegance of the writing. Anyone who appreciates powerful and lyrical writing and a gripping story will love The English Patient.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Graphics are good and fun to play especially at work. Easy to control even for young children. However take use of parental controls.
B00013RC66|5.0|I love this movie. I have seen it quite often and never tire of it. now I can watch it any time I want to.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I had this game, the I thought that it was stupid because it was just like dragon story but harder because it is more confusing and complicated. It has way more stuff which is supposed to make it.a better game but it seems pretty stupid, those extra things just make it hard to play which makes me mad which makes me punch my kindle which makes it turn off which makes me reboot it which then makes me delete this game. Thanx.
B0089LOG02|5.0|It was well written and kept my interest piqued. It's hard to believe that it was based on things that actually happened. I kept thinking about the characters after I was finished with the book.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|It's a great game at first, but then it gets kinda annoying and its just like every other village building game like dragon story, farm story, Oregon trail, pet shop story, theme park, dragon vale, animal rescue, littlest pet shop, the Simpson's tapped out, etc. I don't even play it anymore, it's more of a nuisance. Whenever  I get  a notification on it I'm all like &quot;ah, crap. I have to go check on Jurassic park, uggghh! Might as well get it over with&quot; also, the dinosaurs, expansions, decor, evolving, and research on DNA get expensive and things take way too long, hard not to spend cash. Go ahead n get this game, I don't care, but it's just like every other game. At least it's free
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Excellent content and writer. Bought both Kindle and hardback copies. Will refer to this book often. Always good service from Amazon.
B00445RHKI|5.0|Best family show since the Cosby Show! It is fresh, relevant, and really speaks to the blended families of America.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I have seen this so many times I'm worried I'll wear out the DVD! Every time I watch it I hear something new. I literally laugh out loud, even alone. I could personally do without the two 'gross-out' vomit scenes- but at least I know when to turn away. The music alone is wonderful. A must own.
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I kept hearing about this band vaguely.  At first I didn't really pay attention to them.  All I heard was that they were a band of sisters who decided to start a band with the influence of their parents who enjoyed good rock music!  I didn't go crazy to look into the band though.  Then I heard that the sisters debut album kept Justin Timberlakes second \\"20/20\\" album from the top spot in the UK charts.  That is impressive.  If there's one thing I know, its that the UK usually foreshadow a groups success in the US.  So I read more into the bands impressive upbringing and I heard the song \\"The Wire\\" on the radio and liked it a lot.  I previewed other songs from the album on YouTube and I could not help myself, I had to get the CD.  Their sound is so 80s, yet futuristic at the same time.  There is even some R&B influence in there.  I also agree with many people who compare them to a more modern Fleetwood Mac, the music my parents liked!  So after a few good listens of this great debut album from 3 sexy, yet talented sisters, here is a track by track review.<br /><br />1. Falling:  The pulsing beat and guitars in this song are so relaxing yet danceable!  The singing is swift and heavenly.  Very sexy!  Some have even compared the vocals to Michael Jackson and I can't disagree.  There is something just majestic about this song.  The music video really suits the feel of the song.  Great song to start off this classic album!  10/10<br />2. Forever:  The transition into this song is just clever!  This really sounds like a lost 80s hit pop song!  Her vocals make me melt!  There is a nice guitar section in the a little over halfway that leads into one of the most infectious bridges I've ever heard in any song in recent memory.  Many have tried to emulate the sound of the 80s recently, and this is one of the songs that more than succeeds!  10/10<br />3. The Wire:  The first song I've heard from the band.  Probably the first song from the band to gain attention in the US.  The song has \\"Anthem\\" written all over it.  At first I thought it was way too poppy for me during the first part.  But then the last 90 seconds kicks in and blows me away.  After multiple listens I love the whole song more and more.  It just puts me in a good mood.  Feelgood song.  I hope this or another song hits big in the US!  Again, sexy vocals!  10/10<br />4. If I Could Change Your Mind:  The guitars are so urgent in this song in a good way!  The vocals are almost crooning at parts.  The chorus is beautiful!  Great song for any gender to listen to while thinking of that person whose mind you want to change!  10/10<br />5. Honey & I: There is a slight beach feel in this song.  The vocals sound a bit off beat at first, but I realized its part of the sound of the infectious song!  The chorus really gets better and better.  Listen to this at the beach with that special someone, or anywhere as long as you're with someone special!  9.5/10<br />6. Don't Save Me: The synths that are the backdrop to this song are nice.  The singing is seriously some of the most infectious and beautiful I've heard in a long time!  The chorus makes me feel all fuzzy inside.  Yeah I just said that!  Try not to sing along I dare you!  This song is the perfect combination of pop and rock!  10/10<br />7. Days Are Gone:  The sounds heard in this song are infectious!  The verses are golden, but honestly it took me a while to get into the chorus.  But when I finally did, I loved it!  The falsetto in the chorus latched onto me.  The bridge is also pretty catchy!  9.5/10<br />8. My Song 5:  This is the most modern sounding song.  It is also the most original!  The arrangement is just so smart and infectious!  The vocals from all sisters are really used as an instrument here!  The use of interweaving vocals is nicely done!  There is a nice guitar part also!  This is the most rocking song on the album!  10/10<br />9. Go Slow: As the title suggests, this is one of the slower songs.  It really is very relaxing!  It reminds me of the band The XX without the male vocals!  This song is going to become a 'love making' staple.  Very sexy and relaxing song.  The guitars, vocals and drums compliment each other so perfect.  This is one of the best songs of the decade!  10/10<br />10. Let Me Go: The beginning and chorus sounds a bit like a Florence and The Machine song.  A minute and a half into the song the beat picks up pace!  It sounds like a great song to listen to while running in a forest!  Another great guitar part invades this song with a great solo sounding a bit like Black Sabbath!  These girls really have many great influences!  This is an epic epic epic pop song that rocks out!  10/10<br />11. Running If You Call My Name:  This is a really chill song!  The vocals are just heavenly and again, sexy!  I seriously melted like 10 times from listening to the vocals from this album the first go round!  This song just closes the album perfectly and leaves you wanting so much more, but also feeling content!  10/10<br /><br />This album lived up to the hype.  Actually, this album surpassed the hype.  I was not expecting this pop rock masterpiece to be even half as good as it is.  This is beautiful music from 3 beautiful sisters!  I am a 20 year old male who listens to many types of music ranging from Eminem to Kanye West to System of A Down to The Beatles to Arcade Fire among many others.  But an all female band wasn't really ever on my radar until now and I am so glad and not ashamed to say this is one of my favorite albums of all time now.  The vocals are perfect in every song.  It's almost as if this album is too perfect!  The instruments engage beautifully.  The harmonies are just gorgeous.  This is what a pop album should be like.  It doesn't just sound like a collection of songs, it sounds like one big work of art, if that didn't sound too artsy.  This is music for anyone who likes good music!  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  You won't regret it.  I'm predicting this band will have a long and prominent career!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This was a great boook I had to read it but it turned out to be really good. Probably won't read it again though
B007HOOAH6|5.0|This book is<br />Short but cute. My two year old loves this book and thinks it's the funniest thing ever.
B001TH16DI|2.0|Sets especially.....  But Blu Ray reveals so much more that is dated.  Make-up, special effects, sound, and costumes.<br /><br />Would look great on a small black and white TV.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Sorry, but I find this book extremely tedious.  Just not my cup of tea!  Not too fond of geography and war stories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to finally have this app. The best thing is I don't have to lose all the extra lives from friends, you can get them when you need them instead of when you first open the game and you already have 5 lives and the extras can't be used.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I thought this was a short story, but it was longer than that; I think you could call it a novelette.  This little story was delightful.  The words flowed beautifully and simply .<br /> It was quaintly old-fashioned in its style, appropriate for the era in which it was set.  The plot was rather predictable but did not deter me from continuing to read it.<br />This book would lend itself to reading aloud to older children as a serial or just as an uplifting gentle read.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The new power cord did not correct the problem I have. The battery will still not charge unless the cord is set at a particular angle. I think this is an internal hardware issue not the cord/charger.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have watched it many times on tv and had to have it for my collection.  It is one that I will watch for a fun viewing.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Baz Luhrmann's version of Fitzgerald's classic &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; sizzles! Each scene and every frame is hot to the touch. The characters are well drawn, and the actors are perfectly cast: Maguire's Nick wavers between wide-eyed innocence and wearied ennui; Mulligan's Daisy is just the right mix of sadness and whimsy; Fisher's Myrtle is brassier than a jazz band; Edgerton's Tom intimidates and infuriates; and DiCaprio's Gatsby nails the melancholy hidden beneath a mask of dapper calm.<br /><br />Has there been a brighter, more colorful movie? We're treated to a madcap parade of star-spangled evening gowns and party dresses drizzled in glitter. Meanwhile, Jazz, the maddening pulse of this film, thumps and trumps with the occasional interlude from Jay-Z, Fergie, and other pop stars.<br /><br />The first half is a terrific surge of energy, color, and frenzy. Three quarters the way through, however, we see the film sober up. As a well-executed matching of form and function, the audience, like Gatsby, starts to see through the facade of tinsel and lights. The gleaming, thumping bacchanalia fizzles out, and Gatsby's castle for the first time feels &#34;too-big,&#34; empty, and overwrought. The dream dissolves and colors fade while our title character's lifelong journey takes center stage.<br /><br />I'm hard-pressed to name a film as bright and beautiful as Luhrmann's &#34;Great Gatsby.&#34; Fitzgerald's book (his legacy to Great American Novels) deserves nothing less than all the color, sound, and well-managed mania of this adaptation. Always criticized for his cinematic excesses, Luhrmann here has harnessed the frantic and fantastic to give us a vision true to Fitzgerald's story while at the same time expanding it to fill the widescreen.
B007I0OY02|5.0|This is a great memoir. Tina Fey manages to capture snapshots of her early years growing up and coming into adulthood (and into her career) with great humor, mixed in with some fantastic advice from one woman to the next as a friend, mother and boss, and she does it with style and without sounding snobbish or as though she's preaching. Such a great read!
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|Fun, good graphics, keeps you involved. Loads well, is fasted paced. easy to use,and easy to recommend. Get it now.
B00122A28A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites when she came back after having Lourdes with a chance of heart and sound.  Total classic. A must have Madonna album!
B0055D3EOG|5.0|I'm a huge horror fan but it takes a lot to actually scare me. I thought this movie was pretty scary. It didn't rely just on the obvious 'ghost jumps out at you' scare that it could have used. The plot was novel and had me engaged through the whole thing. I'm still confused about parts of it but I'm sure the next one will clear a few things up.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I`m sick to death of zombie movies<br /><br />but this movie was done with some style and pulled it off well. very well done so good movie
1400168252|2.0|This is a review of the audiobook voiced by Stefan Rudnicki.<br /><br />My introduction to SWTWC came via Bradbury's screenplay for the 1983 Disney film of the book. It was a succinct and visually compelling distillation of the fantasy tale, as I later concluded. The film was well-paced, had an evocative musical score, and was an apt re-casting for the classic confrontation of good vs. evil, and the devil/Dark's faustian bargain in the town library, with a redeeming reconciliation of father and son thrown in for good measure. I found Bradbury's screenplay to be a  fitting foundation for the film's director, Jack Clayton, to create the visual narrative.<br /><br />As for the book, it got off to a good start -- Bradbury excels at setting the scene. The problem with the text is that RB could not cleanly propel the narrative to its denouement and conclusion. EVERYTHING, it seems, became scene-setting in SWTWC. I suspect the book was written at a time when RB wanted to push his writing skills to more dynamic level. Unfortunately, he pushed his story off the cliff, trailed by a long train of hyphenated nouns and eccentric adverbs and adjectives.<br /><br />In short, the book is terribly over-written. Quirky and cutesy phrases like \\"the surfing of splashes of glass at his feet\\" and \\"they ran in clean ice-smell\\" over-wring the tale, turning sequences and chapters into a clotted, belabored, awkward and ill-fitting poetry. The result is a numbingly eccentric cubist tale framed in over-heated expressionistic tableaux - the wrong formula for a narrative set in a small midwestern town. There are just too many distracting descriptive details in SWTWC while the dialogue between the characters, by contrast, is pedestrian -- making for a non-blend. This means the characters don't get as developed as they should.<br /><br />See the film instead. Jonathan Pryce as Dark and Jason Robards as Mr. Holloway give solid performances that hit the mark where the book could not. By contrast, the book's awkwardness taxed even the gifted Rudnicki who valiantly tries to voice RB's overwrought syntax.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|I was not expecting such a good movie as this<br /><br />I have not seen this good a movie in a while very heart warming. It did not just joking around it had that and more really delivers.<br />i was really happily surpriced.
B009QU9X44|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading Americanah having thoroughly enjoyed and loved all Adichie's previous books and talks. Although the blogs written by the main character are really strong and offer valuable insights and thoughts on race in the US, they felt contrived and to my mind didn't match the temperament of the main character whose story seemed secondary to the ideas that Adichie wanted to convey. Having said that Adichie makes the worlds that her main character Ifemelu have to negotiate seem so vividly real and vibrant. I just wish I didn't feel like I was reading a strangely inserted academic essay every so often.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|this movie was very good<br /><br />this was one of the best movies i`ve seen in a while, good action, good plot, would like to see a sequel on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see this finally available for Kindle!!!! The first day I tried to download it, it said my device wasnt compatible, which was so disappointing, but they fixed the glitch the next day and I downloaded it without any trouble and have been playing ever since! LOVE THIS GAME!
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Amazing movie i would recommend this movie to anyone very funny and exciting near the end its kind of sad but i made it through
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like a strong woman in a professional setting.Some of the character do not have much depth though. still a good show.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|And in saying best effort in years, I mean that it really is tops, because Motorhead's quality is generally very high.  On Aftershock, though, they've spread out a bit much like their last superior, top-of-the-line effort, 1916.  Put these two together with the immortal Ace Of Spades and you have a triumvirate of magnificence.<br /><br />Mikkey Dee is on point as always, one of rock's most underappreciated drummers.  Lemmy is Lemmy, the growl of bass and growl of voice as terrific as ever, lyrically as biting as ever too.  The real star of Aftershock, though, is Phil Campbell.  His riffing and soloing have never been better.<br /><br />Motorhead is a sound all their own, unique and utterly original.  Within the first two chords of any song, you know it's them.  And when they stretch out some, and get some great production, as on Aftershock, you realize just how great they truly are.<br /><br />Key tracks:  End Of Time, Death Machine, Dust And Glass and Keep Your Powder Dry.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|the chemistry between characters is solid. I love Louis,mike,harvey... Donna is an absolute gem. She is a womans woman and does a fabulous job. can't wait for next season!
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I started reading this book with a lot of trust and expectations. The first experiment did not work, i even gave FP an extra half a day, i was so desperate for it to work. NOTHING happened. I have decided to stop reading and not waste my time any more.<br /><br />And for those who love to find fault with the people for whom the experiments don't work: the author does not provide any conditions. It is like: do this and you will have the proof. Try this, and it will work. She does not say it depends on how much faith you have, or how long you have been \\"manifesting\\", how pure you intentions are, etc. So, it should work for everyone, regardless.<br /><br />I wonder if the author \\"manifested\\" all the bad reviews here... If this is so easy and works so well, how come she cannot manifest only 5 star reviews?...
B008602KQI|3.0|I'm a parent of two teenagers and didn't think I would enjoy the movie.  It was a little different for me, as I like action, but it kept me interested.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints.  I cannot stop reading this book.  It is awesome.  Truly in &#34;the King's&#34; style.  Highly recommended for any King fan.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Humphrey Bogart plays the part of Rick in this movie masterfully.  All the cast is great as well.  Especially his leading lady.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini is always an excellent read. He takes one's breath away with his verbal images. Anything he writes can be bought blind!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game. Very addictive.  So glad I can get it on my Kindle Fire now.  So worth the wait.  Need a move suggestion help page...maybe.  Would help when we get stuck on a level.  Thanks Candy Crush!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A real page turner.  What an intertwined plot?  The author leaves you wanting a sequal.  We had fun discussing at book club.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|its like a firs person shooter easy controls good graphics game i just love the game so much i would suggest it to all u tablet or phone players out there
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Pacific Rim does right what so many hollywood action/adventure movies do wrong. It's fun, energetic, powerfully visual, and extremely entertaining, all the way through. It has some rough edges in terms of acting or it's use of temporal relations, in regards to the plot's timeline. None of it's small drawbacks play any significant role in the viewing experience, which, by all accounts, is one of more enjoyable cinema experiences of 2013.<br /><br />Pacific Rim has a more detailed and intriguing plot than you might imagine from it's Godzilla/Mech Warrior roots. They take the audience to new places visually, while simultaneously offering some fun new science fiction goodies for lovers of the genre.<br /><br />Overall, Pacific Rim is a super-fun throwback to big-scale creature features.
B00005Q45W|5.0|What a great Leonard Cohen CD.  The songs show that he is still one of the greatest, and they will live forever!
B0044WUIHA|5.0|I love movies when man overcomes nature to survive. A very feel good movie! Wish they made more movies like this.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|An excellent album by one of the all-time greats!  He is incomparable and this album is one of his best!
B001C3KMAM|5.0|I loved it. takes me back 40 years when the &#34;melotron&#34; was first systhesizer. They could make the music revolve around the arena
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|This DVD of Leonard Cohen's London appearance is truly great.  Even though he is in his 70s he still is amazing, and this DVD is the next best thing to going to an actual Cohen concert.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|They played some of the tracks on the radio. It sounded wonderful. I loved it. I'd recommend it to anyone that loves this type of art. Very cool.
B009NXD6JM|3.0|You might like it but it is not my cup of tea....but was ok. It was like living the life of an air head
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very fun game. Keeps your mind going.I recomend this game for any age range.<br />I am so glad I bought this game.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Loved this film from the beginning.  All I have to say is watch through the credits.  Can't wait for Pacific Rim 2!
B003V4AK8E|5.0|The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is very good. However, it seems to wear out faster than the original PS3 controller. For me, this controller lasted about half as long as the original. (This controller last a year for me.)Considering that this controller is about half the price of the original and it lasts half as long, you are spending the same amount of money for, in my opinion, a better controller. I  have used the Pro Elite for many different kinds of games, such as; shooters, sports, racing, & puzzels. It has Prefromed great for me and hopefully will for you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son LOVES this game!!! He is always yelling at it to get the minions to win yet he laughs so hard when they crash. It's a great car ride type game.
B00FF8OKJE|5.0|This has been a fun game that will keep you involved and on your toes. I would recomend it to everyone.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie did a good job of following the book. If you have read the book you will not be disappointed. I enjoyed both.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This was totally not what I thought it would be! It's filled with humor, suspense and life lessons. I would recommend it to anyone!
1401938906|5.0|Very practical on the experiments regarding energy and your thoughts.  I found it amazingly accurate in doing the experiments myself.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|When you watch this movie you obviously aren't expecting a masterpiece. This is a silly comedy with a whole of cheesy movie moments. But it will get you a laugh and it is entertaining.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show, that has a great plot.  I love that there are different side stories throughout.  The characters are well developed and the acting is perfect. It has been awhile that I have watched such a show with substance.
1781162646|3.0|This story was slow and wasn't like the other Stephen King novels that I have read.  I finished the book, but was not impressed.  I love Stephen King, but he missed it on this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids and I love this game so much! Good entertainment for young and old alike. It keeps us on our toes and make us collaborate with each other. Great for our family teamwork.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|SciFi fandom awaits more screenplay with such quality writing, acting, and story lines as this series.  Until then, we'll replay...
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Love the band but a CD that's 40 minutes long it's kind of disappointing.... But the music is great!!! I enjoy it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King was in true form when he wrote this book and clearly wanted to give readers a sequel that would live up to the original.  The story was more like a paranormal thriller, in my opinion, rather than a horror story.  It definitely pulled you in from the beginning as Dan (Danny) deals with the demons of his life stemming from his experiences at the Overlook and his gift, the shining.  You get a good picture of who he is and what sort of life he's lead.  Luckily, he's a redeemable, lovable guy.  He has quite the journey in this book which leads to a gripping and awesome ending.  About halfway through the book, it was difficult to put down.  Even my 14 year old son has been reading this which is a testament to how good of a read it is and how it can span so many generations.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Morgenstern's Night Circus is unbelievable . . . in a fascinating, wonderful way.  It's the kind of story that keeps pulling you along and whets your appetite for more.  I repeatedly said, &#34;I have no idea where this is going,&#34; but I couldn't put it down.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|My new obsession. This show is great. Can't get enough of it. Like lays you can't watch just one. Watch it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan has done his homework.  The historical perspective clarifies many questions about Christianity's Jesus.  It confirmed many of my personal views and leaves the faith option in tact if needed.  Some may feel &#34;That was then, and this is now,&#34; but it seems to me we are up against a similar &#34;empire&#34; as our democracy faces an invasion by plutocracy.
B00FEB09VA|5.0|Excellent movie, a great tear jerker, reminds us of the value of family no matter how obnoxious they are. It proves the<br />Saying blood is thicker than water. Will recommend it to people who are in the dumps it is a better alternative to pills......

B005QYKD4I|2.0|my internet speed was slow/choppy on my old PC while watching this movie online for the first time.......the movies showed faster on my new laptop so its a PC issue and not really amazon's issue.<br /><br />No FREE HD option...I'd prefer to watch movies in HD which I later found out I need to buy a separate device in order to get HD movies online.  That sucks b/c i'm not buying a separate device for online movies.
B00BM7ORFO|4.0|Really enjoyed this one. I'm just getting into Nicholas Sparks, and am enjoying his style of writing, and looking forward to reading more of his work.
0316212369|4.0|Having reread all of Iain M. Bank's Sci-fi novels and some of the others in the last year, I think The Hydrogen Sonata is a good Culture novel.<br /><br />  (Spoiler) The main criticism that most of the other reviewers have is that so many of the plotlines don't seem to matter by the end of the novel. But that is the main theme of the novel: An entity never knows what the final worth of his/her/its existence will be, even at the end. And the odds are good that it will be worth little to anyone but him/her/itself.<br />  Vyr's almost completely undefined familiar 'Pyan', contributes virtually nothing of value to the plot. Pyan is the most subtle character Iain used to reveal the theme.<br /><br />Check out Surface Detail, Use of Weapons, and Excession for five-star Culture novels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Your going to love it and hate it, but you will not want to stop playing it. It gets you hooked.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have been a fan for quite some time.  I love The Original Series (I saw as syndicated re-runs) and all the other shows.  The new versions do play with the cannon, but I believe they do stay true to the &#34;flavor&#34; of Gene Roddenberry's original concept.
B009FTAH3W|5.0|It is one of the best books have every read. I can't read this book at any other better time. I was going through a stage where only these book could have given me hope and can ease me to go through. I give it five star because according to me it is worth. I have read this book three times and whenever I read this book I fell so relax and easy. It makes me positive towards my life. Thanks Sir Robin Sharma for writing such a wonderful book. I am sure many people will be benefited by this.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|It was really a strange story, and will smith just didn't seem comfortable in the part, He did not fit, and nor did his son.
B00DW1WR14|1.0|It seems the best years may be behind these guys. I found the entire release lacking something - focus, energy, something just isn't there any longer.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|I love the new album from The Black Keys, El Camino and listen to it all the time. You will enjoy it as well
B00280LYIC|5.0|It is such a good book I can only describe it as amazing it is simply and only amazing .
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Well done, good action, and a very fun movie...it wasn't a waste of time, like most movies these days. Check it out!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|The book starts off slow and seems to spend more time on alcoholism than the &#34;shining&#34; or related events.  Once all the characters settle into place the book finishes quickly with out many scares or exploration of the characters.  Everything seems a little too neat and tidy for my taste.
0823003035|1.0|The drawings which I sawin the look inside/surprise me sections was excellent. However the samet quality is not reflected in the print content. The print quality was lot inferior.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This amazing death star has over 26 minifigures, three floors, and a whole lot of rooms! I really love how much detail went into this thing, though I don't like the price. The minifigures are well done and finally Lego gives us enough minifigures to really enjoy the set. It has everything from the meeting room to the emperor's throne room and the detention cell to the trash compactor. Really, really, really, really, really great set! I would DEFINENTLY recommend this to any lego and star wars fan!
B005PK57IK|4.0|Great stories very interesting. I couldn't stop watching this show.<br /><br />Great characters . Like that it is in Chicago. Thank you
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use ebay a lot and this application made using it very easy and fast.  I prefer this over the website.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm obsessed with Candy Crush Saga and I've been searching for it on the Amazon app store since I got my HD back in January. Much to my delight it's now on my Kindle! And I actually like playing it better on here then on my laptop! :)
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great price for a great game.  It is fun to play and has a good replay value on it, that's for sure.
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|Its a silly movie, but the three main actors and a boring nothing to do day gave me a reason to watch all the way through.  So I gave it three stars.  I have seen some so called B sci fi tv shows that would get a minus five stars, but at least this one was OK to watch.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|Compared to the original film, the animators have come sooo far in making feature level animation each week on the show.<br /><br />But that's not enough to make a five star rating. No, that's because with the arcs and the non-linear story-telling style, this show offers depth that detractors of the prequels would have to eat their words on. The show seamlessly bounces from one arc to another, from one part of the wars to another, and I am so happy that Dave Filioni announced last week that we will see the final episodes next year. Thanks to everyone who made the show!<br /><br />If I had one quibble, it's that Anakin has all but disappeared in this batch of stories. In several episodes, they cameo in his image, but Matt Lantner doesn't get much dialogue, that's for sure.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Really enjoyed this oldie...lots of star power and good Grisham story  that has many twists and turns.  Enjoyed it alotl
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Some people have said that Iron Man 3 was the best, which I strongly disagree with.  The movie itself relied on computer animation and not on a creative story line.  How many times can a person watch destruction and mayhem?  In a word, it was boring.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I'm a cat lover, so when James writes about his relationship with Bob, I am completely hooked.  Since it is a TRUE story, it makes it even more interesting and entertaining.  I highly recommend this book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The story was a little slow getting started for my taste.  The interesting part of the book for me was that all characters knew each other.  This is definitely a girly book.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|This was a lousy movie compared to the real judge Dredd by Stallone. I mean the entire movie takes place in one building. Just flat for me.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|It really draws you in and makes you anticipate what's going to happen next, fantastic character development. A must see !
B00ELD3MUW|2.0|I'm not happy with this product, didn't work at all. I really don't think it was suppose to work with my Samsung/Andriod Pad.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Well, they keep getting better and killing off the most unexpected main cast. You really don't know who is going to lose their heads next, keeps it very exciting.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this app. Helps because I don't always need my computer next to me at all times. Its easy to use and hasn't kicked me out.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|This show started off as another &#34;zombie&#34; program, but I have learned to really like the plot and the characters and can't wait to see what's around the next scary corner.
B002UTKSBK|5.0|Very Crisp sound. It was the perfect choice for a birthday party. We had the theme music playing in the background.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I rated this game 5 stars because it's a lot of fun to play. The only thing I don't like about the game is that when I play a level a certain amount of times without passing I end up running out of lives and have to wait a certain amount of minutes in order to start playing again, but other than that, the game is a lot of fun! Yes, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles and a challenge.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Book 2 was only average .<br />Did nothing to continue the high standard in Book 1<br />Dont think I will purchase Book 3
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It gave me a clearer understanding of Jesus, from all my reading and meditation concerning the life of Jesus<br />of Galilee and the people who followed him.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|One of the most well written and directed shows I've ever watched.  Season One will draw you in and keep you on the edge of your seat, as hungry for the next episode as a walker is for the living!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|IF YOU LIKE OLD TRADITIONAL COUNTRY, THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED, YOU CANT GO WRONG!!!!!  WE ARE TALKING VINCE GILL HERE!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have a Galaxy Tab 2 and trying to get Netflix to work with it is impossible.  If I use my MAC it streams Netflix but with no sound.  Hopefully they come out with an update to fix these issuses, but until then save your money and time!
B00932H7FW|5.0|Showtime's best kept secret by far! To date, is equal to other pay-per-view channel series such as Sopranos, 6 Feet Under, Dexter etc. Fast paced series will keep you on edge. One of my friends compared this to the older TV series \\"24\\". But Jack Bower and his previous prime time show have nothing on the amazing cast of Homeland and their new-born intense thriller! Season 1 was unbelievable. Highly recommended.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Amazing behind the scenes look of how some of the best rock music albums came to be. If you are fan of music, this is a must watch.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|I enjoy a lot of B movies and those such movies usually present horrible acting and highly contrived plot lines.  They are, however, usually quite entertaining.<br /><br />I feel badly for writing a negative review because the main character is played by a child actor.  However, Young Mr. Smith is really lacking in the acting department.  He has no screen presence.  I believe he attempted to implement a neo-Earth accent, but he sounded instead as if he had a speech impediment. It is a shame that his talented father feels the need to showcase this child simply because he is his son.<br /><br />The plot was the reheated leftovers of many a previous film and did not hold my attention whatsoever.  I would not suggest spending a dime on this rental, as I assume it will be streaming for free soon enough.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|great movie, worked great, watched it streaming and downloaded as well. was easy to work and for my daughter to work
B00009V7OL|5.0|My family and I enjoyed watching this together. I knew it was a good movie because I had seen it when I was younger but this DVD includes an extended version that has quite a bit of footage that I have never seen before. I love this movie and my family enjoyed watching just as much as I did.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Plot was a very nice twist off the &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; movie.  Had a great opportunity to showcase the special effects team and show the ships in action but they didn't.  The Enterprise was beaten so quickly she never got a shot off.  Also, hard to believe the ships could go from Earth to the edge of Klingon space in a few minutes.  Last issue was the foul language.  It added nothing to the move and limits the ability to watch this with the kids.  Overall it was a good movie that could have been much better.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|Great to find new film.  A bit pricey, but works great.  Film is not sealed in the box, not in a pouch.
B0045IPOPE|5.0|Don't let the descriptions next to the genre tag fool you. This movie is not just a \\"drama\\" or \\"war\\" movie, it's a horror movie. The horror may not be from things that go bump in the night, but rather, what's depicted in this film are things that would frighten any human being with a soul.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk about the differences between the original or the redux. Quite frankly, I'm not sure if I've seen the original, so I'm not going to discuss the matter at all. What I am going to tell you is why this movie is so great, and why you need to watch it.<br /><br />Let's start with the obvious, this is a loooong movie. I thought 2001 Space Odyssey was long, but this movie takes the cake. Why is it long? Because if you distill it to the very bare bones, it is a journey. A wretched, demoralizing, and horrifying journey into the \\"heart of darkness.\\" Captain Willard is tasked with the elimination of a Col. Kurtz who has gone rogue in Vietnam. He is escorted by PT boat crewmates Chief, Mr. Clean, Lance, and Chef. It is on this long journey up river, that you are given glimpses as to what could have driven this Colonel mad.<br /><br />One of the things that this movie does well, is that it doesn't waste time getting into the conflict. I know, ironic because the redux version is 3 hours long. But those three hours are filled with scenes that keep you glued to your seat. Some people complained about the levity that was added to the film, but I actually think this was a great move. To me, seeing the characters play pranks or get involved with playmates helped further the character development. It made the people on the boat feel like real human beings and made you care for the characters even more.<br /><br />My heart truly went out for these boys on the boat. They didn't want to be in the war, they just wanted to go home, and now they had to escort a man they didn't know up into dangerous territory. They kept it light when they could, but the war in Vietnam made it impossible for them to enjoy peace for long. You watch, painfully, as the crew starts to lose its grip on reality. You're forced to see them fall apart and turn on each other, feeling the effects of the war impressed upon them.<br /><br />Then, when they finally arrive to their destination, taking into account all the things they saw while journeying up river. Willard, unwillingly begins to understand why the Col. Kurtz went \\"mad.\\"<br /><br />This movie epitomizes why war is so terrible and puts into perspective that the reasons we fight for are reasons not worth fighting for at all. The reason I call this movie a horror, is because most of what is depicted in the film could happen in real life.<br /><br />It is a wrenching experience to watch this movie, but if you can schedule some time to watch this movie from start to end, you shouldn't miss it.it impossible for them to enjoy peace for long.

B005LAIIMG|5.0|Loved it, would love to see a part 2, where everything takes place in Manhattan, especially the projects, the supermarket and the subway system.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|When I read that HeAd was joining back with koRn for a summer tour and that he was going to record with them again I was a little uncertain of that decision. I started praying and asking God to reveal Himself through HeAd and Fieldy with this effort. I went to their show in Vegas on 10-12-2013 and gave this album a listen through. The guys did an amazing job and I am now certain that this was a great decision by HeAd. Great Rock album for anyone's collection.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This book was boring and not cleverly written.  I thought it sucked and I expect more from this Grisham guy.
B007EE564U|5.0|'The Last Man' A superb thriller once one became familiar with the Afghan names, acquired on my Kindle.<br />Whilst visiting the States recently was introduced to this writer  'Protect and Defend' - also riveting.<br />Vince Flynn does not appear to have hit the RSA market - pity because he writes a riveting yarn.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Even just the pilot made me laugh out loud repeatedly (though also inspired in me plenty of nostalgia for the '80s).  They showed terrain that was *clearly* in & around the Grand Canyon in the U.S. Southwest, but passed it off as \\"Somewhere In China\\" -- another early giggle.<br /><br />And to Patty & Selma, Richard Dean Anderson is still quite a hunk -- the quintessential '80s man.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Absolutely love this game. It is fun and challenging, and absolutely addictive!<br />Glad that it FINALLY became available for Kindlefire!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very entertaining!  Hard to stop playing.  Time flux cuz I have so much fun playing candy crush.  Would highly recommend this game.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Good album for fans of classic JT. As I was listening to it I realized how different music is today so this is probably for a certain audience and not really so much for the kids today.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best show I've ever written.  Characters are engaging and multi-dimentional.  The best show I've ever watched.
0385743564|5.0|Brandon Sanderson keeps coming up with new &#34;magic systems&#34; that are very imaginative and impressive.  His writing style pulls you into the book to identify with the characters and empathize with them.  I loved this book and can't wait to read his next books.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Excellent film!  Not your typical testosterone filled fight movie by any means.  I will not hesitate to watch this movie again.
B005LAIIGW|1.0|I don't know if movie theaters still have booths where a guy fumbles with reels in a blue haze of projection light, but if there was a guy back there in a room above the last row, I would have told him to shut the damn thing down, not because it was awful, which it was, but because I was leaving and because I was the only one there. Really. Number one movie in America and I'm the only one in the theater. My first time with an unexpected private showing, albeit of an unexpected god-awful time waster. Oh sure the CGI was good, but how good was it really if I'm referring to it as CGI. Besides, never having personally been in space I can't vouch for it's authenticity. The much bally-hooed 13 minute opening shot introducing Clooney and Bullock floating around each other like Pillsbury Dough Boys on acid had me thinking, boy I really like this pair and the snappy dialog so I sure hope nothing really big and bad happens. Actually of course I was hoping for their demise from the get-go, they and all their space crap crashing to earth about 50 feet behind Pacino and Hackman who are reprising their Scarecrow thing from '74. Now there was some real acting. But no, I gotta watch Sandra Bullock alone aboard an abandoned Russian Soyez with as many dials, gauges and levers as the set builders can cram in, effortlessly locating a manual on how to run all this stuff. So these space capsules come with manuals? Apparently, and even though all the name plates on the dials and stuff are in Cyrillic because this is a Russian craft, seems the manual is in English because Bullock finds what she's looking for in about 5 seconds, spends another 5 reading it and va-roooom, she's got 'er running. She also got me running for fresh air and my Jeep. I lasted for close to an hour, but I think this thing ran for an hour and a half. I  paid 8 bucks to get in, offered 10 to get out, but ya know what,  they actually let me go for free.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was really cool to find out what happened to Danny Torrence. I couldn't wait for this book to be released and I wasn't disappointed!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally here, :-):-):-):-) So glad to finally have it available!!!!! ****** love the game, love it mire on my Kindle Fire, woo hoo!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is tottley awesome and if u like dispicable me than u will love this. have fun because it is awesome!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett gives us a remarkable look into the lives of peasants, noblemen, and politicians -- from Great Britain, Germany and Russia.  His descriptions allow one to feel and see what people wanted and how the war and revolution altered their countries.  this book is not only about the events of WWI but also the Russian revolution. The condensed and recent time frame made this book much more readable and relateable than &#34;Pillars of the Earth.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing this game for a few months, now. I'm so glad I can now play it on the go!<br /><br /> Very addicting game! So glad it's finally available!!!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Interesting movie.  It kept my attention, but seemed to be lacking in depth.  I did enjoy seeing the father/son dynamic between Will Smith and his son played out.  Overall, I would say its okay, if you have nothing better to do.
B008EL25LE|4.0|very had to see some of the game the color of some puzzles over lap and to much of a blur
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|The dialogue and effects are cool.  The spiritual elements at the end seemed a bit hoaky to me.  The &#34;aha&#34; moment at the end was also lacking . . . even though it did surprise me . . . somewhat.
B00F9040HU|4.0|it got a 4 for its not a full game. the 1st atlantis was a better game and enjoy playing it
B000I55YV2|4.0|I don't watch a lot of movies because I don't like violence.  This was just my speed.  It was fast moving, suspenseful, exciting and had me rooting for the bad guys.  I do recommend this unless you're a fan of shoot em up, torture, and gruesome.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Love this one. Very easy to play. great story line. Very nice graphic. part 2 was a miss hopping three will be better
B000003TSP|5.0|Anyone who has heard Portishead knows the haunting, yet melodic sound. Very unique band, first two albums are must haves. I noticed the CD missing from my collection so I had to re-order it, figured I'd give it the 5 star rating it deserves along the way.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I purchased this case cover for my husband's Kindle. It's lightweight and provides just the right amount of protection. He's happy with it and that makes me happy :)
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Dream Theater's best album in ten years -- since Train of Thought -- and among their best ever with Train plus Awake and Images & Words... superb songwriting and musicianship.
0307279189|5.0|This is one of the few books that I would read again.  Not much of reader but read this cover to cover.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book just made me miserable.  If you loved Divergent and Insurgent (as you probably do, since you want to read Allegiant), then you'll probably hate this book.  I did.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert (probably unnecessary at this point...)**<br /><br />There are two main reasons why I was so disappointed and depressed after finishing this book:<br /><br />First, the explanation for the factioned society was that Chicago was really just a giant genetic experiment to fix faulty genes.  WTF?  Where did this come from?  That's what you come up with, Veronica Roth?  Genetic manipulation gone bad, and the attempt to fix it, explains everything that has happened??  I felt let down by this 'resolution,' because to me it resolved nothing.  The genetic manipulation idea has been examined in other books and while it might explain some of the reasons behind actions of certain characters, it just did not flow with the plot of the other two books.  It seemed like a throw-away to me (like aliens causing \\"The Dome,\\" in Stephen King's book).  And the fact that the United States, just like Chicago, was full of power-hungry corrupt people more than willing to let others die, all while watching it unfold on camera...sigh.<br /><br />Second, WHY THE ENDING???? I loved, LOVED, Tris and Four together.  Loved to the point that I re-read the first two books repeatedly and was so excited to see what happened between two of my favorite characters.  And now...I can't imagine re-reading any of the trilogy, seeing as I know there is NO happy ending (or even an acceptable ending).  I cannot express how disheartened and depressed I was after realizing, nope, Tris is actually dead.  For real.  No, 'haha, she pulled through!'  Or even, 'she's disfigured, but Four loves her anyway!'  Just the destruction of one of the best couples, and heroines, in recent memory.<br /><br />Mainly due to the ending (because even with the genetic-manipulation plot, I could have dealt with the book if it had a different ending), this is one of the worst trilogy conclusions I have ever read.  I invested heavily in these characters and these relationships, with the promised silver lining that at least Tris and Four would make it through somehow.  There were so many other ways that this series could have ended and made for a more satisfying conclusion, yet still stayed true to the characters.  This ending ruined two otherwise great books, and one mediocre one.  In short - do not read this unless you want your heart to break and need a good cry.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It does what we thought it would do. The only problem was our fire wall needed to be disabled during installation.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a good reminder to us that happiness in life is our own choice. The four agreements are simple and easy to implement. Good Book.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This story gives you a powerful insight into the life of someone who suffers from Alzheimer's and how it affects their families, friends, and colleagues.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very interesting plot with unique story. Can't wait to read the others. There is no way of knowing where the story is going to take you
B009C7JS14|4.0|Just my opinion.<br />Had this app before and liked it, tried a few others and came back to this one, great app.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Not worth $5 you should get it from redbox if you really want to see it. Jaiden Smith has the weirdest accent
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excelent read. Loved the use of scientific examples and easy to follow experiments. If you can't follow her steps, the information she shares is still worth keeping stored in your subconscious. The writer's tone is affable, confident and spunky.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I never get tired of watching and laughing at this show.  I even dressed up like Sheldon for hero day.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I tried the new FB app it crashed so I went back to the old stand by this one hasn't failed me yet.
B0053O89WY|5.0|A friend told me I would love this show.  Ignored him for years.  Now I have 5 seasons at home.
B00FN811SY|5.0|It is an excellent app with invaluable info.  Unfortunately, I have had to utilize the info from a friend's Apple tablet; because you cannot open the purchase of this app, using a Kindle Fire,  This is very depressing.  Why not say, this app cannot be used on Amazon Kindle Fire devices; and we'd move on to purchasing some other device.
B00G03LDSO|5.0|I like the new songs and acoustic renditions they released with this deluxe edition of murdered love. I realized that they took off my favorite song from the original album which is I am. i know the song got a lot of negative feedback because Sonny cursed, but it was such a great song it really spoke to people, just a little disappointed in that. other than that great additions to an already great album.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|One of the most clever lawyer shows I've ever seen. The first episode gets you hooked and you can't stop after that.
B007EC27QM|3.0|I don't like to have to be signed into amazon to use this app. Cant they give you free apps without having to be signed into amazon all the time.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|As usual the Brits have it all over us when it comes to casting, plot and production. David Tennant alone makes this show worth watching. The season starts with the death of a child and as the episodes progress every principle character is drawn forward, turned over and examined. First rate television.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|It is a fun waste of time. I usually don't like comedy, but I actually laughed while watching these shows. I must say I am turned off by all of the sexual references. They are cheap distracting and unnecessary.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!! My friend talked me into joining and I just love Pinterest!! No problems or ads and its fun!
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|An oldie but a goodie. Always loved this movie. Couldn't find it near me, so I ordered it. Great buy
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|It is accurate. Receiving emergency and weather alerts is very beneficial. As the weather changes for the worst, AccuWeather is right on top of it with updated information sent directly to your phone.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|From the beginning to the end this movie is hilarious. .one of those old movie that you'll watch over and over again

B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I downloaded this for my son to use when doing his homework. Works great but I'll always prefer paperback I'm old school!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan Brown really knows how to write a good good book. But if you've read any of his other works in the Robert Langdon saga, you know that he's very formulaic. It makes his books very predictable, but this one was based in D.C., and that alone gives it an extra star.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|I will keep watching this movie so I can make sure I catch everything.  I really enjoyed it. Very creative.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author has a gift for bringing his world to life. From the very beginning you are asking questions about the environment the author plops you into, and those questions only grow as the novel wears on. Wool was excellently crafted, and I'll definitely read the sequel.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|i am in level 500 but kindle has not updated the game!!!!Hurry Hurry!! please hurry update.....love this game to pieces!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is the best if i can get it on ny phone.my kindle.n,jus any where else.i jus rather hav candy crush saga.its the cool game out there..
B00BOXZAG6|5.0|Kirsten Dunst shinning in this sci-fi with romance film. Great direction, special effects, and one history what makes believe in this future.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|this was just a waste of money and time. I won't be renting a third installment of this garbage. p u
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|There were many twists and turns to this novel, which made for a good read.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants an easy read but also some thought provoking themes.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|I first heard Zaz at a cocktail lounge in Prague that seems to go out of it's way to find really cool artists.  Once Shazam (the app, not the wizard) told me who she was, I noted it and bought the album when I got back home.  I was at first entertained by the album, the music is catchy, varied, and very well executed.  Though after a bit I thought was starting to tire of it, but then I started to hear all the subtle nuances that make for great music.  Her phrasing is absolutely wonderful.  Her range blows away a lot of more famous singers and all-in-all she is just the kind natural talent that rarely comes along.  I describe people like Zaz as living and breathing music.  Everything is natural; even the mistakes make the music better.<br /><br />Once of my other favorite artist is Jacques Brel and while Zaz can't yet be compared to the great one, she is cut from the same cloth - that combination of music and drama that makes it all special.  I can't wait to get her next album.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|It is user friendly and simple to comprehend. Hopefully I will be speaking German pretty soon.<br />I would recommend this for sure.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It's full of zombies and shooting. Pretty typical zombie movie. Running away from zombies while trying to find a cure. It was OK.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Easy to get addicted to. Presents new challenges at a nice rate. Fun cartooning great colors. Hard to stop playing. Not too long of a loading time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great story keeps you engaged and rooting for your favorite characters. Wish all the books were ready to read so I could keep read ing.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|better than the second (which was among the worst sequels of all time), but that doesn't say much. there was only 3 good jokes in the whole movie, and the rest felt more like a drama than a comedy. the first hangover was funny, exciting, and widely unpredictable but this one was stale. if you loved the first one and want to see how it ends it's worth watching.
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|If you don't have this album then your collection has a gaping hole in it. This is the landmark album by The Dave Brubeck Quartet. They were already the most popular jazz group in the U.S. when Time Out was released; after its release they were launched into legend with the innovative time signatures mated to lyric melodies. One of the greatest jazz albums of the twentieth century, and yet to be equaled in this century.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|I cant get enough of it this music is outstanding!!!!!!  even if i'm having a bad day ,it lifts me up where i belong<br /><br />really i would recommend this to anyone that loves good music!
B003B02OOG|5.0|I have read every book written by John Grisham.  He has the talent seen in the Irish countryside writers (such as Frank Delaney) for telling us about life as we it is.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read the first two books in the series and loved them. I have probably read them each 100 times. However, this book was a huge disappointment to the end of the series. If you like the first two, don't buy this one. Imagine your own happy ending that will definitely be much better than the one here. Not worth your money.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|This movie was great.  I didn't know until after the movie it was an M. Knight movie and that made a lot of sense.  It is one of those movies where you don't know what is going to happen next and there are a lot of things I've never seen before.  That is what I think makes a great movie.<br />I am always a little hesitant to watch movies with teenagers in them because of the awkward years with the screechy voices and all but the director pulled it off.<br />Worth every dollar, 2 thumbs up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I absolutely love this game I'm on level 421 on my phone. I can't seem to stop playing this game its very addictive.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I didn't care for the way it was filmed. It felt like the director's approach was to treat the viewers as if they were partying right along with the characters and would enjoy a weird trip. Wasn't for me.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Missing functions available with iPhone and Google play. No quest tower, no fighting arena, no crafting building, no trading building and the farms are smaller. If offered in The Line Fire HD then if should be the same on all formats.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Could not tear myself or my husband form the Downton. My husband really enjoyed the history of the season and as well as the first season. It was great fun for me to find something we both enjoyed. We have also purchased the third season, can't wait to watch it  next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is the best game ever! I've been waiting for it to come to kindle. I've always played on my mother's iPod. Again this game is awesome and I HIGHLY recommend this game for ALL ages!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoy this game a lot.  Like the progressively more challenging levels. Also like the levels that have two rooms. Keep a notepad handy for the higher levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got this game after playing it on my friends IPod  I loved it from the beginning. It's Great and it may make you hungry. Good for before dinner.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush never gets boring and really keeps you playing! even when you get frustrated with a level you just can't put it down.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Great way to pass time when you're commuting or waiting on the motor vehicle department.<br />you will be amazed at how fast time slips by while playing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun game. Daughter had this game for long time on her I Phone and let me play it once and I was hooked. So glad it finally became available through Amazon for my Kindle!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i am happy that you fimaly got it. now you need to get some more king.com games. love it. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't have a smart phone and i have been waiting for this game to be available for the Kindle!!! Now I can Candy Crush everywhere!!!! :)
B00F35B8F8|2.0|Yes, the effects are awesome. Yes, Cumberbatch is compelling. But nothing can make up for the plot holes you could fly the Enterprise through, or the senior officers squabbling like middle schoolers throughout. This franchise has had many cringeworthy outings, but this one is right up there with the worst.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good fun to play free enjoyable velocity boo d o bible stuff Willy Sonia a f2f lax today they've done that you can do it might be illegal and thought it was cooler master plan is a virtue of the aquarium my friends house cleaning up lines here is a good read more about yourself and thought I would say hello
B00AJCTY8S|5.0|I heard All I Want and pre-ordered the CD from Amazon on the basis of that one tune. I had a feeling this was going to be good and I was right. It's great. I heard the song on cable TV while surfing some alternative music station, and I immediately taped it to hear over again. His voice is haunting. The songs just grab you and they don't let go.  I wonder if Kodaline would be surprised that a 63 yr. old woman appreciates their music (and lyrics). My favorites are One Day, (the lyrics make me weep), All I Want, All Comes Down, and Talk. But there isn't a bad track on here. What a solid debut \\"album!\\" Thank you, Kondaline!!
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have bee updating my DVD collection, and this bundle was a great value for the movies on blu-ray.<br />Best thing I bought since the 40th Star Trek convention in Vegas.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|always worried about a power failure, I am hooked on this alarm clock.  has never let me down. waking up to violins playing is very soothing
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|All the hype about &#34;Casting your web pages to your TV&#34; are bogus! While it sounds like you can do so via PC and tablet, all it really works is via PC. The only reason I bought this thing was to send my tablet's web pages to the TV so the device is a waste.
1608871827|5.0|I love movie books...like, a lot. I own a ton of them. Most books like to grab screen shots of the film, hire a hungry graphic designer to slap them together in a glossy tome, throw it on a hook and cast it out to you. You bite because \\"IT'S SO DAMN PURDY!\\" then after that wears off you realize you've just spent 30$ on a book full of stills from the movie.<br />Not only is this book full of great behind the scenes goodness, it's got a nougaty center consisting of storyboards, sketches (by Guillermo), poster designs, concept art, and more. But before you hungrily sink your eye chompers into the scrumptious details, you see that sprinkled on top are posters, blueprint cards, ID cards, sketch cards, stickers and two huge posters tucked away in a envelope in the back of the book! Holy Christ on a Kaiju!<br /><br />Best movie book ever, buy it and eat it...er, read it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Tayor swift's music awesome seller thanks for the fast shipping ! now i have all of her albums and hope there'll be more good music to come!
B005ZB91KY|4.0|I watched this with the idea it was going to be a so so movie, but I was wrong. This so worth watching
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game the only thing I don't like is the few energy that is allowed to play with. Wish there were more
B007V65R54|5.0|I wanted a book that would tell me about real life applications of Statistics and this book does a great job of it
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of it read it in two days totally recommend this book for anyone who loves Stephen King.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love E.L. James writing. She captures you from the first page and carries you to the end. Very entertaining, great read for me in a long time. Waiting for more!!!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Catching up on the early years, so glad I did explains a lot of the ongoing story lines.  The acting is superb, Dame Maggie Smith is wonderful, the writers have that part and the other actors nailed down!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Well let me start off by saying that i watched this on the big screen thinking that this is going to be a flop however i regret not wearing a depends because holy sh.. This is very scary. This movie from start to finish is wow. I dont want to ruin the movie for you but it is omg scary from the second they get to that house to well the blank happens at that house. The scaryest part in my opion is the hands clapping a singing when shes looking down the stairs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So glad it's available for kindle! Each level is more challenging than the next. Great animation and graphics
B006PIXKVW|1.0|The movie was not scary or bad but the topic is VERY SAD!  Had I know this, I would not have let my daughter see it.  It was like watching Annie but worse.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I love this card, the Ivy Bridges run a little warmer than others, but if you have a good cooling system you can run some CPU intensive games w/o problems. I personally play a lot of DayZ on ultra high settings which is a very CPU and GPU intensive game very smoothly, between some of my motherboard features and features with this CPU I have this clocked smoothly at around 4.2ghz w/o problems. This card beats out many AMD and i7 CPUs, especially for gaming.
B00E3QJ7ZG|4.0|This is for the blu ray copy. The picture is excellent, the sound is clear but front speaker heavy.  One point, the man beaten in the flashbacks is marshall Duncan, not the stranger (Clint Eastwood), and he is killed and buried in Lagos.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good read. I took my kindle to the beach and got lost in the story, very good!! I liked how the author presented all age groups making the readership more widespread. I missed the story when it was over.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I love books that travel through time, telling several stories that blend together to make a whole. Very pleasurable read.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Enjoyable song with good lyrics, Amazon's service works and I prefer purchasing my music on amazon over Itunes because all your purchased music is stored on their cloud.. I like to have a diverse variety of music to enjoy. Listen to the sample clip before you buy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addicting!! The game you love to hate. Now I know what the buzz was all about.  Very fun game.
1451662432|4.0|I always enjoy hearing about other's view points and experiences in life.  Always something to learn from others.  Arnold has done a lot of different things in life.  Good read and interesting,  not earth shattering but interesting none the less.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Felt like I was re-reading Insurgent, with this time around Tris accomplishing her goal. Thought there was something bigger in the works. Very slow pace through out the book, issues get rehashed. The enthusiasm that the series is held for me is not in this book. Wish I would have never read books in the 1st place.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|Great book for a crossfit athlete or anyone just wanting to be a better athlete.  Lot's of information about training and different techniques.
1558908382|5.0|New in plastic. Bought for teenage daughter, but actually a funny movie for adults too. One of better Cusack movies.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|Arrived new and sealed as promised. Excellent movie. Best characters since the original series. Have both movies. Excellent. Great. Thanks
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the story, talk about some twists and turns that I did not see coming, Mr<br /> King brought enough of the past and mixed it with the present to weave together a masterfully well written story!
B00000ADG2|4.0|It's no wonder LH has been in semi retirement since this mid nineties release. I mean, the Fugees was pretty good but this album was light years better. especially Zion.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this to be available for the kindle fire hd I couldn't be happier very addictive and fun.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|What terrific, absorbing characters Elizabeth Gilbert created to tell the story of the Whitaker family and the story of the growth of science in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Alma Whitaker was especially engaging. I miss her already!
B001GZ6QBU|1.0|OK, so here's the deal. I already owned this movie on Blu-Ray. But the one that I had didn't come with a digital copy. And that is why I bought this one, hoping to get the digital copy. It's been almost two months now, and I've been going back and forth with Warner Brothers trying to get them to assist me, because the authentication code that came along with the DVD to download the digital copy was not authentic. This was the only reason I bought a 2nd copy of the movie. I still don't have what I was trying to get.
B00F1J3G9C|4.0|I just upgraded to this full version. Everything works great. There are step by step set up instructions in the trial version. Smooth transition. I just wish I could get to my tasks, even just to see them.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I have to quote Thor, the strongest of the mythical Norse Gods. &#34;Stream shall at source be stemmed&#34;<br />This book deals very well on the menace coming from the east and the best way to deal with it. The refusal to use a Drone in Somalia, is a call of our time. Dealing with the brain washing by the Islam religious schools is an other matter, but there is an influx of fugitives from Muslim countries and with them sleepers which can be woken up, at the call of a hate preacher.<br />The in comprehensive Ariel is interesting and shows that only those of different mind can get deep rapport with the cyber machine.<br />As in other books, by Mr. Forsyth you glide through the lyric text as a snake i water<br />Elías Kristjánsson.
B009POHHRG|5.0|This is a must read for any Batman or Alan Moore fan.  Great story and art. Do yourself a favor and read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very cool strategy and loved the ending, unlike all my friends who didn't!!! Love Grisham's books!  The best!!  My favorite author!!
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Though Lorde is only 16, she's got chops.  Give this girl time, and I think we'll hear more interesting and unique tunes.  Moody and intriguing all the way through.
B00FEX2ZFG|3.0|As far as the plot goes, for a true story, it was pretty good. The sound effects are what made the movie SCAREY though. I think it was definitely exaggerated a bit, but like I said, how many times can you watch a movie and know that no one in there right mind would open a door knowing it's not a good idea, and after already being terrified enough to poop your pants? Especially children?! I think (I KNOW) I would have told my parents that I'm going to go live with Gramma. (Just an example of doing something crazy, not a spoiler.) It was a terrible thing that happened to this family, but all things considered, and I certainly DON'T mean to downplay their horrible experience, how can a lot of these things be documented as fact when no one was around to actually verify the events. In other words something that happens to one person could be exaggerated a bit...we all do it. The, &#34;I caught a fish THIS big&#34; kind of thing.<br />I guess I'm sounding like the cynic here, and I REALLY don't mean to at all. The true story this movie depicted was truely HORRIBLE, so If you're looking for a SCAREY movie to watch, with the lights off, don't have a bowl of popcorn in your lap if your volume is turned up. Lol. Since I never was much of a horror movie fan, although I've always been scared by the witch on the Wizard of Oz, most are very predictable to me. It's just always been the sound effects that made me jump out of my seat. Trust me though, this movie definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what happens next. So it wasn't a half-bad movie at all, I was just a little disappointed after reading all the reviews saying that it was such a great movie.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best game ever. It is that only game that I've played for  three straight  days. I only got it three days ago.
B001EBV0OY|2.0|I wasn't impressed, It wasn't bad, it's a good movie but I can't believe how highly it's regarded<br /><br />It's really overrated and pretty depressing until the end
1476733953|4.0|I heard about this book from friends and was excited to read it. I'm an advocate for self-publishing works and to hear about Hughes success with this Science Fiction series was inspiring. Getting to the story. Now I've only read Wool and will be reading the prequel and sequel, but I wished we had more of the initial sheriff's existence. He seemed like someone to look up to. Beyond that this is a great new series to follow.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this game and playing w friends and family. First thing I do on Monday morning is play this game and try to get the highest score first.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I LOVE A GOOD LOVE STORY. I WAS SO TAKEN WITH TRAVIS, WOW ANOTHER BOOK BOYFRIEND!! MAKES YOU REALLY BELIEVE IN THE HAPPY ENDING.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|A wonderful and inspirational movie. I could watch it over and over and probably will. This clearly demonstrates why you always have to look deeper to appreciate who someone is.
B00C7607BC|3.0|Well, this product is ok, those whom looking for import I will warn you about the DVD because is region 1 and the BluRay Disc is  A,B,C regions.<br /><br />It includes the BD, and a DVD plus includes a Digital Copy Plus \\"which means you can choose AMAZONIV, VUDU, Itunes and others\\"<br /><br />I really like this movie for my wife so, I think is a good bonus the DCPlus, but I should recommend that you go for the 3D version which includes the Music Download Factor (No CD included)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it is not that hard but you have to take time to figure it out. super fun during playing it
B00A2DIW3C|4.0|It is 1979 and BEN RICH, who runs Lockheed's legendary SKUNK WORKS, is in the Nevada desert for a test of the super-secret operation's newest development, a stealth fighter plane code-named HAVE BLUE.  Half the Pentagon's radar experts think Skunk Works has achieved a stealth technology breakthrough that will revolutionize aviation in the same way as the first jet fighters.  The other half thinks that Rich and his people are deluding themselves and trying to pull a fast one on the Pentagon.<br /><br />Written with Leo Janos, this is Ben Rich's memoir of his years at the legendary Skunk Works, America's most secret aerospace operation.  Like Tom Wolfe's THE RIGHT STUFF, the book chronicles an age of American ingenuity, filling in a technological backdrop and outlining a by-gone era.  The book evokes everything from that great scene in APOLLO 13 where the engineers improvise an air filter from bits and pieces to whole movies like TUCKER and FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY.<br /><br />Rich first starting working for the Skunk Works in 1950 and in 1975, he took over as \\"boss\\" of what was then one of the most secret facilities in North America, even though it was housed in an unmarked building within plain sight of the main runway at Burbank Municipal Airport.  Known as \\"the Skunk Works,\\" the official name of the facility was Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects.  Like most of the Skunk Workers, Rich had been handpicked by the recently retired CLARENCE \\"KELLY\\" JOHNSON, one of American aviation's legends.<br /><br />The stories recounted here provide a capsule of Cold War America and probably the most dramatic story in the book is the saga of the U-2 plane and pilot Francis Gary Powers who was shot down and captured, triggering an international incident and a tense standoff with the Soviet Union.. Even more interesting is the relationship of Rich and the Department of Defense dweebs who oversaw much of the Skunk Works research.  There's constant tension there, constant in-fighting.  Add the various intelligence agencies to the mix, and it was a volatile combination.  The politics (and the office politics) of the situation were pretty intense.<br /><br />The characters provide the strongest element of the book.  Rich's portrait of the charismatic and tyrannical founder of Skunk Works is priceless. Johnson was \\"a apiece of work.\\"<br /><br />ohnson is only one of a number of dimensional and entertaining characters at the center of the story.  But you can find charismatic characters all over the place in technology--both genial (like JPL's Matt Golombek, the best ambassador for Mars research ever) to unlikable (any number of expatriate German scientists invited to the US under Operation Paperclip).<br /><br />There are some wonderful elements here, and the book (like DRAGONFLY, the chronicle of the space station MIR) is a terrific piece of history.ting.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|I was really excited for this album because of the new songs that were great! (Roar, Walking on Air and Dark Horse).<br />The previews sounded awesome, so when I got to hear it, \\"Prism\\" was everything that expected and maybe a little more. Every song is great (there's no bad song in this album), and it's so different to Teenage Dream, so if you were expecting a Teenage Dream 2.0 or your typical mainstream pop album, you may not like this one. The lyrics are more mature, and you get to see that Katy has grown as an artist.<br />The album has a variety of songs; potential singles, love/break-up songs, and party songs. So, there's a song for everyone, but the best songs are the bonus tracks. It's a shame that they were not included in the main album!<br />Anyway, with this awesome production, Katy is here to stay at the Hollywood scene at least for 3 more years, I can't stop listening to this album! Buy it if you're a Katy fan, or if you liked Roar!
0718149912|1.0|Very &#34;wordy&#34;, to much like reading a manual. Didn't enjoy. Some okay tips if you can endure reading through it all.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This movie has been out long enough and there are enough online reviews that will give those who haven't yet seen it a basic synopsis, so I won't rehash the plot.  What I want to do is explain, in my humble opinion, why I believe this movie deserves at least 4 stars.  Also, I think some may be missing the point of the movie...<br /><br />First, is the overriding message of the movie which has nothing to do with space travel, creatures which have evolved to kill humans or trying to prove something to one's dad (lol).  The overriding message of this movie is understanding one's fear and through that understanding learning how to control it which is an excellent message for anyone... especially adolescence.  I think because of who's in it (name recognition) the movie catered to a specific demographic (adolescent boys or young men) who are usually in a 'fearless' stage of their lives and who don't understand the spiritual concept of fear.  Though I wished the scripting/dialog for Will Smith's character had done a bit more to explain what fear is, it at least did a good enough job that the average young person and adult could understand and resonate with it IF they were paying attention.  The concept of controlling one's fear in the beginning of the movie dragged a bit and seemed clich&eacute; and shallow, but towards the middle and the end it really popped.  While watching this movie I found myself reflecting on my own fears, thinking about how I choose to explain fear to my child and feeling a deep communion with the two main characters of this movie.  For a futuristic, drama laden, action adventure movie to have that kind of impact on me makes me sit up and take notice!<br /><br />Second, the father/son dynamic is very good here.  Perhaps that's because Will and Jaden Smith are actually father and son and have a healthy relationship?  I don't know, but it came through in spades.  Their chemistry was poignant and there were times when I could envision the two of them sitting at the dinner table interacting with each other similarly to how they portrayed their relationship on film.  I enjoyed that because I don't often see the same chemistry in other father/son dynamics on the big screen or on TV.  That aspect of the movie worked for me.<br /><br />Third, when was the last time you saw an African American father and son have any kind of positive, normal, familial dynamics at the movies?  Can't think of it, huh?  That's because it practically doesn't exist (lol)!  Usually, most African American family portrayals at the movies or on television are full of exaggerated buffoonery or they are so stereotypically negative and base that most viewers would think that Black Americans have no normal, positive, familial dynamics... especially fathers and sons.  This film shows a convincing and real contrast to what is usually thrown up in the average American's face about Black American families and that should only be viewed as a good thing!<br /><br />This movie moved me for the above reasons.  Yes, I do think the acting was a bit off (lol) and the beginning of the movie could have been a bit fuller, but overall I think the cast and crew of \\"After Earth\\" did a mighty fine job of putting together a thoughtful, action packed and well-grounded movie that, if reflected on, should not only keep the audience on the edge of their seats but make them think about the concept of fear being the wrong kind of motivator in theirs and possibly their children's lives.<br /><br />M.Night Shyamalan, who helped direct and produce this movie along with Will and Jada Smith, is one of my favorite directors and storytellers.  If you notice... again, if you're paying attention, all of his movies have one overriding concept in them:  understanding your fears and learning how to control them.<br /><br />Ya gotta think, people... don't let it go over your heads!

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am very dissapointed this book felt so disconnected from Divergent and Insurgent , there are major flaws in the plot , the DNA talks gets annoying  It doesn't make sense,  not even a fade to black love scene ... And that ending???? WTH was that it wasn't even heroic nor epic VRoth . Girl it wasn't *INJECTS MEMORY ERASE SERUM* worst goodbye to a series.<br />COME TO MAMA FOUR I WILL MAKE IT BETTER
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I couldn't put the book down - kept my interest, especially the battle scenes - sort of an anticlimax though - could there be another book on the way?  I have read all the books at least 10 times and will do so many more.  Wonderful series!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Good to have something, other than Youtube to watch videos. Cool App. I especially like that the stream is continuous.
0545265355|5.0|Wonderful series, keeps you right on the edge for a well written, exciting trilogy. Best reading in a long time. Highly recommend to adults and mature teens.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I do not like the hints that comes as soon as you see the play. I wish there was a icon to request hints. Good otherwise.
B000002GBJ|5.0|This is not just for fans of classical keyboard or contemporary performance.  Turn up the bass and it sounds almost as good as the vinyl.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|It's a very good app! My head actually started hurting after one of them.<br />4 stars because I need more games!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|great graphics great graphics great graphics..... Loved it ...... Best ang bird ever good good good good game. Get it now
B00B7FW6U4|2.0|Slow. Ending was cool. Otherwise same ol pa schtick. Tried too hard to have a reason for a camera in every shot.
B006OITIQE|5.0|SHe loves it and is asking when i can downlad some more of there music...Always a fast download and having a backup is nice also.

B005W3G2D4|5.0|Downloaded for my 13 year old but my 8 year old loves it also. I enjoy being able to shop fpr music like this.
B00BXKOMT6|5.0|A thoroughly engrossing story that is very well written with constant tension or action while the layers of the plot are being revealed
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Grandchildren love this Movie and watch all year round.<br />We get to experience a little bit of the Christmas Season all year.
B00CATSONE|1.0|I have difficulty believing this book when the author refers to Tesla affecting the Empire State Building with his inventions in the 1890s. It wasn't built until the 1930s.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series.  I was just thinking the other day that I can actually watch this my my 17 year old daughter and not be concerned about what may happen.<br />We laugh all the time at the one liners that Maggie Smith delivers with expertise.<br />Love this show
B0053TMP24|5.0|Awesome because it was really good I really liked this book good buy so don't hesitate to read buen trabaja
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I purchased this based on a Kindle recommendation.  It was mildly entertaining, but very lightweight.  I am an avid reader of good literary fiction; this falls far below that standard.  The characters and writing are in no way memorable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You will love this series if you love the 1920's. You feel like you have been taken back in time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game rocks and i would love a temple run crossover to this game. maybe dome marvel orcdisney characters added woukd be cool.  PlayStation or xbox version would be great too.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The book starts out slow and is not up to the standard set by the previous two books. However, I would have rated Allegiant a strong 3 or even a weak 4 until the last page of chapter 50. Quite frankly, the ending made me wish that I had never read the series. I cannot even express how disappointed, outraged, and betrayed I feel in how the author chose to end what could have been a great series. I will not be reading anymore books by this author. I wish that I could get my money back from the ones that I already purchased.<br /><br />My advice would be to save your money and use your imagination. If you buy the book, be aware that you most likely will not get the ending you desire.
B00FJU1HLC|3.0|Liked the scenery and plot but the dialogue was a little lacking. Definitely enough action to entertain my toddler. I was a little disappointed.
B009PEKRY6|5.0|This album is very much like another artist I love.  I wasn't sure if I would want the whole album, but many singles grew on me, so I knew I had to get it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My kids, who are too young for Facebook accounts, love playing this. Now they fight over who gets to play next. ;)
B00F87A7HG|4.0|I really love this band, so I thought I'd give this album a try.  It isn't bad at all, I see it growing on me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this game on Facebook & was hoping to have it also on my Kindle. It is addictive in the nicest way.
B00ARN0XGG|4.0|This movie found new ways to keep you on the edge of your seat. Even though it is movie number four in the series it still is original,
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I find  FB work great at times I often find glitches and errors. I often wonder is the privacy set really private? My friends say the same and we all use other methods for important messages to our friends or we have websites at other places.
B000O5AYC0|5.0|And it's a great starting point for beginners. Five out of five stars!<br /><br />If you like this album, check out High Violet and Trouble Will Find Me.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I kept waiting for something to go wrong and complicate the storyline but it never did.  The past Grisham books I read seemed to have a lot of twists and turns and this one did not.
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|This is a great album and Myth has become my girlfriend and my song. We started dating around the time this album came out and it was the first show we saw together, so every time we put this album on it transports us back to when we first met.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|So far the forecasts have been accurate.  All of the information is readily available. It's also very attractive in appearance.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a great device! Easy to setup and easy to use! So easy in fact that I can move it around the apartment, from TV to TV, without any difficulty. Right now it's limited to Netflix and what you get from Google Play store but apps for Hulu and HBOGo (and more) are in the works.<br /><br />Also, you can mirror your Chrome browser through it - so anything you can play in Chrome, you can play on your TV. Sometimes there are glitches (for us, Amazon Prime doesn't play sound) but for the most part, this works like a charm!
B0055B7IPE|3.0|Kinda heavy for a kid movie. It was cute. It was ok for a rental, I wouldn't purchase it though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS MY ADDICTION!!!!! I absolutely love it!! It is fun to build and create worlds. I recommend it to everyone!!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|It was pretty good. Had some funny parts. It was a good rental. Not good enough to buy, but pretty good.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|My kids and family liked it so much we bought it. I usually fall asleep for the kids movies but this is entertaining.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|This movie was very funny!  I loved Charlie Day's character, he is a very funny actor. This was a great rental on a Friday night after a long work week!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It was nice to have a change of pace with the beloved characters in this book. The different perspectives were informative and exciting!
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|kinda cheesy and predictable. I think it is not purchase worthy. I am glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever. Every thing is easy to get including the gems . You never really have to buy anything with actual money. I recommend this game to everyone!!!!!!
B009WUBERW|3.0|Nice to see so many memorable action stars in single flick, but not looking forward to sequel - Expendables 3 Attack of the Attends
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|really gets you to focus....the beginning yrs are easy but, gets increasingly more difficult .....sometimes I have to get help.....
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Much better than Stallone original.  Urban is superior actor and Headley an awesome protaganist.  Light on depth but who cares - this is an action film and the action is non-stop.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|Soilwork lost founding guitarist (and key songwriter) Peter Wichers in 2012. But as the band’s 2013 effort (and ninth full-length) proves, the rest of these well-respected Scandinavian melodeath metallers are getting along just fine without him. Indeed, frontman Bjorn “Speed” Strid and company have returned, and in a big way, kicking out not only the first double album of their career -- but also quite likely their heaviest and thrashiest effort to date. Indeed, these twenty-tracks might be typically laden with Soilwork’s world-renowned mainstay: Melodic choruses, but it is not uncommon for one of them to work up a brutal, thrashing groove much in the same vein as The Crown and At The Gates.<br /><br />“The Living Infinite” kicks off with the skippable little intro track (“Spectrum Of Eternity”) before finally finding its legs in the ferocious “Memories Confined.” It is an explosively heavy, driving thrash onslaught that reminds of vintage Strapping Young Lad, and finds Strid’s throaty yells trading off with brutal deathly bellowing. And said vocal pattern is laid over a bullying musical bed of fiery guitar leads and pounding drums. Some mazy melodic solo work is also included, here, too. And it all makes for the perfect lead-in to “This Momentary Bliss,” a blistering modern-thrasher that evokes The Haunted.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Soilwork dabble in beautiful acoustic guitar textures (see “Tongue” and the otherwise thunderous “Let The First Wave Rise”) before offsetting them with patented death metal heaviness. “The Living Infinite I,” however, pulls out all of the stops, and just rips from beginning to end, playing like an uncompromisingly explosive and blistering onslaught of pummeling blast beats, rapid fire thrash beats, and surging, thrashing riffs. Next up is the record’s centerpiece, “Vesta,” a completely instrumental work that is mainly occupied by substantial riff chunk, deft drumming, and melodic leads to give the tune a nice, epic feel. Other highlights of the first disc include the crunching, churning guitar licks, tasty harmonic soloing, and other really memorable and contagious chorus found in “Realm Of The Wasted,” and the set closer, “Whispers And Lights,” a more mid-tempo venture that gets by mainly on the almighty chug.<br /><br />Disc two gets underway with “Entering Aeons,” a song that has some slow and melodic sections (it does, after all, open with some violin accompaniment), and involved melodic soloing. But most of what makes this introductory track an irresistible one is the fact that it offsets such melodicism with a violent, malevolent onslaught of brutal, rip-roaring guitars and blast beats. Then, a couple of tracks later, there is an addictively gorgeous, sweep-picked guitar solo found in “Drowning With Silence.”<br /><br />But this is all just lead-in to inexorable onslaughts like “Antidotes In Passing” and “Rise Above The Sentiment.” These two songs both settle into a racing, charging thrash groove early on, and remain there for most of their duration, although they both do feature a huge (and thus instantly memorable) chorus. And both also rip out a terrific, wailing, and totally air-guitar-able melodic solo section, as well. And the latter half-of the album works similarly, only do so in reverse order to the tracks described above. They lure the listener in with an innocuously melodic tune (see the lovely intro guitar melody, and big, soulfully-sung chorus in “Loyal Shadow”), but not before another blistering death-thrash sprint in “The Living Infinite II,” which has impeccable and thunderous double-bass battery tearing throughout.<br /><br />Clocking in at a whopping eighty-four minutes in length, “The Living Infinite” might be a couple of beats too long, but on the whole, it is yet another excellent piece of brutal yet melodic death metal from a band that has a whole litany of fine albums to their name, and one that pretty much all death-heads should find effortlessly easy to enjoy.t pretty much all death-heads should find effortlessly easy to enjoy.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|The writing was not fantastic.  Story line was mediocre and slightly boring.  I wouldn't recommend.  The outcome of the story was predictable.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Its not the device that was the problem, it's my TVs - they are too old and don't have the HDMI connection that I thought they had when ordering it.  Anyone interested? If so, let me know.
006202406X|3.0|Aaaaah man. I was so excited about this book after reading the first two back to back and again immediately. People are being very harsh because they're unhappy with the way it wrapped. While I'm in the same unhappy boat, I'm not harping on Roth because of the way the story ended. As a writer, I know we have to make difficult choices our readers won't like. My main problem was the way the ending was written. There were a lot of moments in the first two books where I had to reread passages to see if she was insinuating that something had happened (ie... Did they &#34;hook up&#34; that one time and she just didn't write it? There is one of those in Allegiant too, and you never really know.), and with the main part of the ending that everyone is so mad about, I honestly didn't think it had actually happened until it was undeniable. Trying to avoid spoilers here, sorry for the vagueness. I didn't like the way the &#34;issue&#34; was revealed to the other characters either. It was too quick and honestly a little heartless. I needed more from those two scenes as a reader.<br />As for the rest of it, there were lots of questions that went unanswered, including one key fact that I thought was going to save them all... The code to the weapons lab--- &#34;HER.&#34; That was a given for me but it never amounted to what I expected it to, when it was so obvious.<br />I don't know if I'll ever reread this book again, I feel so let down emotionally. I love Tris and Four, I don't love the way they end up. But that's not going to keep me from pursuing Roth's other books. She tells an incredible story, describes emotions and depth of human character absolutely beautifully. I still love you, Veronica, I just don't like you right now!!! :(
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|I am using the kindle fire 2d edition and the decimal point will not work. Please fix. Will rate higher after fix.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is very well written book and keeps the reader up late trying to get through all the action.  I read a fair amount of books and it is always hard to know before I read a book whether it will be good or not.  Have no doubt about this one.  it is good.  If you enjoy the Game of Thrones books or the Night Angel Triliogy, then I think you will like this one.
B008EL25LE|4.0|This game is in the same category as Candy Crush and Bejeweled with some hidden object search thrown in. It's really easy on the eyes and the music is relaxing. Can't comment further. Must play more Azkend 2!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love, love, love this game!!!  This is one of the best games I've played in a long while.  Would recommended it to anyone!
B00FEN1C50|4.0|A decent Godzilla offering. Good effects and fair acting and a somewhat unique storyline. I'll watch it a couple more times for the robots.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!  But, if you once start your hooked & it's hard to stop!!  Some levels are a breeze, but keep going & you'll find it extremely challenging.
B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|Ripping yarn, beautifully controlled, lovely writing. Beautiful evocation of 19th century life on the wild west coast of New Zealand's south island.
B00138H6KA|4.0|The Lady is awesome one of the best I have heard  , I would defiantly  recommend it, easy one the ears !!!!
B007BVOEPI|1.0|You want to watch every kind of sex?  Hear swearing all hour long? Watch vital organs being sliced out of bodies?  Then you'll love it.  OF COURSE IT HAS HIGH RATINGS. Incest, rape, marital affairs.....<br /><br />I call it lazy television making.  It was not until Episode 7 that the story line became tolerable.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|HI All<br /><br />I was really existed to get it<br />I spent as others did a lot of time to figure out how my modem should fix it<br />I have searched every where and I could not make it work :(<br />Finally, i was able to set it up manually and i got the message on the TV: Ready to Cast<br />but my devices could not get that :(<br /><br />I have contacted Google support [7-6540000001982]<br />and I discovered that I will not get support because I do not live in USA :(<br /><br />here is the last reply:<br /><br />Hello Mohammed,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting Google and for your reply.<br /><br />Chromecast is not currently intended for use outside the United States, and Google does not make representations about its functionality outside the U.S. Please note that some countries may have legal restrictions on your ability to import and/or use Chromecast.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it love it love it....this is what all my crusher heads and kindle owners have been waiting for... I'm up all night!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am furious, saddened, pained, and let down by this book. As someone who read Divergent when it came out years ago, I have felt as though I have gone through this journey with Tris. I was attached to these characters, and books. To have it end the way it did? It was unnecessary and downright painful to read. I have been sitting here crying for hours. I wish that I had NEVER read this series. I have never been so letdown by a book before (for someone who reads 5-6 books a week, that's saying something.).<br />I feel as though Veronica Roth said, Thanks to the fans who have supported me through the years. As a thank you I give you, Allegiant! Then flips us off as she walks away to her millions. The sounds of our cries of anguish and pain music to her ears. The ending was not even justified! I understand that some books can't have a Happily Ever After ending. If that is the case, there needs to be a reason behind it. Make there be a point! There was none here. I told my friends to stop reading the series I so highly recommended. At this point, you could not pay me to go see the movie either. What's the point of getting even more attached?<br />Veronica Roth, shame on you. You fooled us all and broke millions of people's hearts. I hope that you are happy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Cant put it down  love it very mind blowing and and keeps you on edge. Cant wait for minutes to pass to try it again
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Abso fab. Unless you live under a rock you know how good this book is. Interesting with out being vulgar.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|This app has the best group of games I've seen yet for brain training! Keep up the good work. I use my brain each day in a difficult tech job, and looking forward to giving it a rest during break time with these games. Enjoy.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Just listened to most of the CD this morning thanks to amazon cloud player and I'm please to say that it sounds great.  It's mixed very well, the guitars sound amazing and the BV's really stand out.  Joe E. sounds great too, I know he gets a bad rap for his vocals sometimes but a rock singers voice rarely gets better with age and he holds his own on this recording. Are you the same physically as you were at 23 years old?  I'm sure they punched up some spots in post production but it sounds genuine.  Better than the re-recordings of some of the Hysteria songs they sell on iTunes, which was simply a money grab and had no heart.  For those that attended the show and the videos I've seen on YouTube, you really got to see a fantastic show and I'm jealous.<br />For less than $15 you get both the CD and DVD, what a great deal! I can't remember what I paid for the VHS tape of \\"In the Round\\" back in the day but it was certainly more than $15 for sure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a great game. i have been waiting for it! so glad it is finally available on the kindle fire!!'
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, this game is available  on the kindle fire. The graphics and color is so amazing. I no longer have to play it on my phone. This app is highly recommended download it right away.
B0073COMUW|5.0|These bulbs produce a bright white light similar to daylight as opposed to the soft, yellow light from normal bulbs. These look best when combined with light coming into the windows, as it blends perfectly in color with the outside light. This is especially good when shooting indoor video.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its a great photo editing app but only if you have the storage space for it. I don't know of any downsides to it other than it takes lots of memory so I give it 5 stars
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is fun to play. I love to watch my child try to get up hills and watch the vehicles flip try to get coins. It is actually quit fun.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|FINALLY!! Now I can continue to feed my addiction on my kindle fire HD! I was starting to think it would never be available for download. This game is everything until you get stuck but even still impossible to stop playing. It has resulted in me putting off countless hours so if you haven't played before PLEASE understand the struggle is real lol! And for fellow candy crushes whom have already fallen victim, play on!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is very addictive. Great fun for all ages. I can't put it down. If you like the movie you will enjoy the game.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|It is comforting to know that others have given serious thought to the question of god and have also found religion lacking in so many ways.  Dawkins presentation provided me with a framework for describing my own thoughts and experiences. It also challenges me to go further in thinking through the implications on society and to consider whether a more active stance against the evils of religion is warranted in my own life. The beginning of the book was an easy read - I could immediately relate to most of it.  The middle to end of the book became more difficult with brief references to many things that I have not studied in detail.  I highlighted a dozen or more referenced books to read, and I will definitely read this one again.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I got it to get a jump on the next part of the netflix series, but discovered it has been much changed from the original, which is a serious indictment of life in prison.  Kerman does a good job of covering issues relating to internment for minor drug offenses and providing almost no opportunity for women to get rehabilitation or a chance at a better job on release.  I was glad I read this book.  As usual the male prisoners get more privileges and opportunities. The book was not what I expected.<br />I did enjoy the Netflix series, realizing it has been exaggerated and fictionalized.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Take my photos and see them on the cloud from my devices.  So easy. fun, rewarding, exciting for me to use.
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|I am a late-coming enthusiast of BBT.  A friend introduced me to the program a year ago; but I had not seen the episodes in order, so did not always follow the story line.  Watching them in order was entertaining and allowed me to see the characters evolve.  Definitely worth the money.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|If you want a generic zombie movie, well here you go!  It has everything you ever want. A kid with asthma, a nagging wife, cars that were working moments ago then refuse to start on the first try, the dark and scary hallway/stairwell/etc.<br /><br />The writers of this movie took nothing from the book that was great when they made this film, other than the name.  I strongly recommend reading the book instead, it is far superior and a lot scarier than this crappy movie.<br /><br />It is interesting how the zombies don't eat humans, and also how ants inspired how the zombies move about. I gave it an additional star for some originality in that aspect, but I am being far too generous with 2.<br /><br />I saw it in theaters and wasn't impressed, and the only reason I purchased it was because my husband liked this movie ;)
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Just a fun mind game. Great for passing time in a waiting room when nothing is on TV.<br />Download and enjoy.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|The quality was super amaizing wavh the movie when you in the airplane no interrupt thank you amazon I love it !
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG I  was super exited u brought candy crush to kindle fire love the game yay....and now I can play on my kindle thanx so much
B00005JPSM|4.0|A horrific accident leaves Catherine Zita Jones' (KZJ) niece parentless. At the same time she is a successful well-known chef, known to say whatever she's thinking to rude patrons. KTJ hasn't a clue how to relate with children, nor does it seem has she spent any time considering anyone else's needs. A new (male) chef comes to work who has a natural ability with children. Th love plot begins - involving the kitchen, the child, and the chefs. Worth seeing more than once.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book, while it made me laugh it also made me cry. While I wished  for a  different ending it was a satisfying and well done conclusion to a very good series
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra Bullock's character reminds me a bit of Meryl Streep's character &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34;. Sandra Bullock is a successful, ambitious boss with a male assistant, who will stop at nothing to succeed. Including bribery to approve a project has been working on for years- if he will pretend an engagement to her - to sidestep a Canadian Visa problem. She knows literally nothing about him beyond his name and makes all the wrong assumptions (of course). Turns out his home is in Alaska, and the family awaits the couple (including Betty White as Grandma - perfect casting) to welcome them into the wider family. (The town was developed by the family and has produced a legacy!) I saw this in a theater and knew I would want my own copy, reminds me of Hepburn and Tracy in some of their wonderful romantic farces.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Ok, I just picked up the 2CD/1Blu Ray Exclusive Best Buy Release for $19.99! AND...it was worth every penny. I have every official release Def Leppard has every put out and its great to have a release of the Hysteria Tour from 2013..<br /><br />As to the Packing, let me tell you, its A++++. The Disc art is fantastic and the booklet that comes with it is amazing. Lots of pictures and very colorful. Leppard has always put alot into their packing and this release is no exception..<br /><br />What about the sound do you ask? Its Fantastic as well. Leppard has mixed this one very well and it makes for an enjoyable listening experience!<br /><br />What about the video do you ask?? Thats the best part! The Blu-Ray is perfect as far as quality goes and Leppard puts on a great show! Im drooling over having Def Leppard in Hi-Def!!!!Hopefully this is the start to more Blu-Rays from them!<br /><br />They are one of the greatest Music Groups of all time and I will buy anything they put out!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game even though it is sooooo addictting.  Olive that I can now get it on my Kindle. I hate that I'm having issues getting connected with Facebook on my IPod.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What an amazing book! I had never heard of Neil Gaiman before this novel but I wont forget him any time soon. The story started off a little slow for me but picked up so quickly that I couldn't put it down. As an adult reading this, it felt like I was reading a dark fairy tale...almost as if I was reading someone's strange dream. Absolutely loved it and highly recommend it!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great Book ! I couldnt stop reading it.  Loved the characters.  Definetly 5 stars in my opinion.  Good Book.  Thanks.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The packaging might not be glorious but it collects all 8 films. 'til WB releases a cheap and decent box set this will do. I've seen this 8dvd set much cheaper on other sites...so up its to you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game for my Kindle fire.  Challenging, addictive and fun, even for the over 40 crowd.  And who can resist the minions?
1250012570|5.0|I picked up this book because of the controversy surrounding it and cause I read the synopsis and KNEW, just knew that I would love it. And you know what? My gut was right. Not only did I adore it but it address issues in a way I never seen before.<br /><br />Plot: The thing with people is that, it could be happening right in front of their eyes and yet they are still blindsided to what is going on right underneath their nose. People don't want to address issues because they fear of what they know is true. This plot for example is not fun. It's a hard issues to address and even harder to live it. Eleanor is growing up in a broken home, with broken parents. She is all alone and the one person that should protect her doesn't. Instead, whatever happens to Eleanor it's her fault. She meets Park. A young man who has been lucky to grow up in a better household. Throughout the friendship, both get to see both sides of a loving and harsh family. Both experience true love and friendship in a way most don't.  They are tied together with secrets and hurt that they can not possibly fix. Or can they?<br /><br />Love/Friendship: I adore this relationship because of their flaws and differences that brings them together.  They are able to bond over stolen moments of peace and clarity. They have a chance of saving each other. And that's folks is the best friend. The one who would sacrifice everything for the sake of the other.<br /><br />Family: Family plays a big role in both Eleanor & Park's life.  The both get to experience the good and bad sides of family. Eleanor especially finds peace in what she thought she never have. She gets this chance, to run away and to be a part of something bigger.  The bad side of family is too ugly to talk about. Reading it alone made my blood boil. But having this author address such a sensitive issue in a creative and artistic way is beautiful.<br /><br />Sexual/Physical Abuse: Well, if you haven't guess it by now this is what this story entails. It's dark and gritty yet you can't turn away. Once you start the story, you are immediately  invested in these characters. I wanted nothing more but to reach inside the story, pull the characters out and save them. Watching them struggle with each chapter as it progressed into a monster just made me cry. I cried. SO. HARD. I cried.<br /><br />Ending: There are books that give endings and there are books that give ENDINGS! This ending is just so bittersweet, you can't help but cry even more. When Parker gets that last note, it not only made me smile but it left me at peace. The story was over and you know what? It turned out okay.<br /><br />I can't even begin to express how amazing and awesome this book is. It gives you hope when you lost it. It touches issues in such a dark, crazy way that is nail biting yet sensational. It gives the reader first hand a gripping and intense ride in such a big real issue. Eleanor & Park is carefully crafted into a one of kind story that you can't put down.  Dramatic and exciting, every chapter excels the next, giving the reader a mind blown sensation. Ruthless and impressive, Eleanor & Park is extraordinary.It's dark and gritty yet you can't turn away. Once you start the story, you are immediately  invested in these characters. I wanted nothing more but to reach inside the story, pull the characters out and save them. Watching them struggle with each chapter as it progressed into a monster just made me cry. I cried. SO. HARD. I cried.<br /><br />Ending: There are books that give endings and there are books that give ENDINGS! This ending is just so bittersweet, you can't help but cry even more. When Parker gets that last note, it not only made me smile but it left me at peace. The story was over and you know what? It turned out okay.<br /><br />I can't even begin to express how amazing and awesome this book is. It gives you hope when you lost it. It touches issues in such a dark, crazy way that is nail biting yet sensational. It gives the reader first hand a gripping and intense ride in such a big real issue. Eleanor & Park is carefully crafted into a one of kind story that you can't put down.  Dramatic and exciting, every chapter excels the next, giving the reader a mind blown sensation. Ruthless and impressive, Eleanor & Park is extraordinary.
B008PZZFHA|2.0|Very slow, didn't like the singing. Not like a standard Southpark show, which is generally pretty funny. There was unbleeped profanity which was a bonus
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! Catching Fire makes you love Katniss all the more, and want to hate the Capitol right along with all the rest of the district people.
B00FPH6M82|5.0|This movie was great! It is so good to see Will Smith working with his son. Love the fact that it was a family movie and how refreshing that there is actually a movie out there with no sex and no taking the Lord's name in vain!
B005529EI2|5.0|This is my third time watching the trilogy and as with each viewing, I was drawn deeply into the epic narrative. No doubt this is the great fantasy story of the twentieth century and Tolkien on of our greatest treasures. Kudos to Peter Jackson for doing such a good job on the adaptation. My wife and I relishes watching the directors cut for the first time.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Love the ambiance of mysterious Barcelona and the book men and the entwined historIes these characters weave. Spellbinding, magical, and provocative for a book lover like me.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is an addictive game. Once you start it you just keep playing and playing and playing. I don't know how to stop and put it down - even when I can't get off a level.
B00F2362IE|1.0|Every time my son plays the game it locks up the Kindle and it is hard to get it to even shutdown.  I have asked him to stop playing the game.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Thank you John Green for writing a book that does not suck.<br />I wish I knew Hazel and Augustus myself.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Kindle Fire was out of space for installing new apps and I could not see why.  This found lots of junk files, videos, and cache that could be removed to free up space.  Now I can download more apps.
B008220C38|1.0|What a mockery of a fantastic and complex novel.  Are people today so unable to focus their attention to deep subject material?  Must we always be entertained and bombarded with tricks?  Badly acted, badly scripted and just plain ridiculous approach.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It brings out the emissions so well done. I loved this book. Even though she doesn't have a child. I love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy amazon finally made candy crush available on my kindle! Highly recommend this game tor anyone who enjoys gaming during their free time. Now, if amazon will make pet rescue saga available, I wont have to use my phone for games any longer. :-)
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This is a very creepy story. As the main character unravels, it's like watching a train wreck-horrible but you can't look away!
B000OVLINI|1.0|The translator or the author? The writing is overwrought and just downright unreadable, but the premise and plot are worse. The sappy idea that all books are precious! Mien Kampf, Protocols of Zion? I could go on,<br />and that's what the author does in this interminable novel with a ridiculous plot and characters utterly unbelievable. So I guess the author is to blame, and you too if you read this whole thing to the end!
B007HACDLK|4.0|His last book but not as quite as good as some of his other books. Same powerful main character and an excellent read.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Movie was fantastic. My family complains that the picture quality goes down when we stream from amazon vs directtv cinema. That's my only complaint but the movie was great!
B005CAATXG|2.0|I once played with this band in Pontiac, MI. They are ok. The drummer has the image of a stereotypical gym rat/guy who bullied the nerds in high school. Why he's drumming when he could be making more money modeling or doing porn, I don't know. I guess everyone has their interests.
B0047MZUUM|5.0|I don't have any children in my family that I could say I bought this movie for. I bought for myself and my husband and we love watching it all the time. I even played it for my mother and she absolutely loved it. It's great for kids but adults would find it equally amusing and entertaining.
B000006OBQ|5.0|One of the all-time best of Sinatra recordings - live and he and this great band were swingin'!  Can't go wrong with this one...
B0041KKYEW|5.0|I love this movie so much. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. It has become an instant classic.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|I've been an avid player of the Rainbow Six games. When I heard about the potential movie and Clancy's untimely passing made me want to read it. It was pretty long. I understand it had to cover all the bases of the story. You have to have patience when reading but it'll pay off. The assaults are action packed and the character chemistry are great. Overall it's a great read for the Rainbow fans
0345529057|5.0|These were in perfect condition, fully wrapped, and came in on time. And they are great books besides. My fiance got me into the first one, and I bought the series. Can't put them down.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love this app. It helpful in studying for meetings. I can compare versions of other bible to get clears meaning.
B00EKXDVOK|5.0|The songs are beautiful. This will be a treat to have  on to listen to<br />over the holidays Good CD
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is awesome but I am knew at this so the next person who makes a review please tell me cause survival sounds awesome with monsters
B00371XIJE|5.0|Hachi: A Dog's Tale is the quintessential story of the dog being humankind's best friend.  Based on a true story from Japan of a dog's unconditional love for his human, this Americanized version places Richard Gere in the role of the human.  If you love dogs (or cats) or even if you aren't particularly drawn to furry friends, let your heart overflow by watching this movie.  Spoiler alert:  Save your sleeves by having kleenex handy before you press &#34;play.&#34;
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Very nicely done film of Fitzgerld's classic. The acting was fantastic. The costumes and sets were fabulous. I enjoyed the modern music injected as twist.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've so been waiting for this to come to Kindle. This is my favorite game thanks for adding it love it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love books that I can hardly wait to pick up again and read. This was one of those books.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It seemed like the batteries in my mouse had to be changed more and more frequently so I decided to try this. It was easy to set up and works great. It took me a little while to remember to set the mouse on the pad when I wasn't using it but once I got in the habit, it's been fantastic.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I thought, Dicaprio's in this movie I'll give it a chance. I barely could stay awake it was so slow and so far from the wonderful novel from which it was adapted. It was ok but I considered watching again just to re-evaluated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love playing this game on my laptop and phone. it is great that i am able now to play it on my kindle fire hd. the colors are great, love it.
B000I55YV2|5.0|Excellent movie, If you have not seen it, totally recommend it!! Plus if you have amazon prime you can watch it for free
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Pearl Jam has done it once again! This album is AMAZING...love all the songs!!  Personally I love Sirens, but honestly the music from the entire album rocks!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally on Kindle.....just like when your on Facebook. The best game ever. Now we need Pet Saga. Thank you for making it available for the Kindle, you made my day
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had stopped playing Candy Crush for a while but just started playing again just to find out it's on Kindle....so, I no longer have to sit at my pc and play it. I can relax in my bed on take it ant where with me. Yay for Candy Crush on Kindle!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love it!  It is hilarious.  So funny to hear him repeat what you say to him back to you:)
B00957T6X6|5.0|I kept forgetting to quit reading, Westeros feels real. Now please write the rest! Who rules, where are Jon, Arry, Danerays.....how did it all turn out?
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This is a good vacation book but not much more than that.  Interesting but a little vapid.  Just didn't do it for me.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|{Small plot Spoiler alert}<br />I've loved this movie since the day I saw it in the theater in the 90's; especially the unique plot about an alien entering a boys body and making humans serve and worship him as a god. Such a very intriguing concept. While the ancient Egyptian pyramids, as well as their legend of who built them, is in certain conspiratorial circles relevant today.<br /><br />To the Blu-ray whiners:<br />Please stop reviewing a movie and giving it the worst rating possible because you bought the wrong Disc version. We know it's a great movie but I don't want to see all the whining on Amazon, because of the bad choices of a few.
B00821OX98|3.0|I liked the first season. I like the characters and the creapy<br />aliens. Seems to continue on like a soap.. maybe that's why I like it.<br />I would recommend this series.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Riveting when you are trying to unravel the mystery.  As always, Phillips Gregory is astounding! !! Always one of my go to authors in this genre!
0061950726|4.0|Loved the history of the children who lived such a difficult life journey.  The personalities were intriguing and delightful, I want to read more on the subject!
B0035JNTA6|3.0|Was an OK movie, we expected it to be funnier.  Not as many great one liners as we thought with this all star cast.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great acting!  You know what the main character is doing is wrong but you can't help but want good things to happen! Not predictable.
B00DIJQAI6|3.0|Fun game.  Controls get frustrating  The tilt steering gets annoying.  The game is feature packed  Just watch out for the steering.
B001XULSG6|5.0|We are the Borg. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service is. Resistance is futile....
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Lost mine, ordered a new one, found mine...<br /><br />Story of my life.<br /><br />I have the first version of the Kindle Paperwhite and it works with this cord.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Get drunk, get high, get laid, meh... rinse and repeat movie to finish out the trilogy. Still some good laughs though.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Very disappointing.  I guess my standards were very high, given how funny Hangover I & II were.  This one is a snoozer, and was nowhere near as funny as the first two.  A couple of laughs, but otherwise very disappointing.
030758836X|2.0|It's not difficult to glean the end, only it takes too long to get there. This book is full of fillers, and it gets tiresome, after her disappearance it goes OK for a few chapters, then it drags on.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I didn't know anything about this series, except people raved about it.  and I now see why!  I absolutely love it.  love the characters.  Julianne M.  just never seems to disappoint.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love it, it's always accurate an tells me the correct weather. It hasn't been wrong this far. I recommend it to everyone.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|This is the best new TV shows that I have seen in a very long time.  I hope it continues for a few seasons.
B001BANK32|4.0|“The Shining” is a 1977 horror story that Stephen King wrote early in his career, and Stanley Kubrick later made it into a movie in 1980 starring Jack Nicholson.  I’ve seen bits of the movie and recognize the famous “Here’s Johnny!” line from Nicholson, which isn’t in the written version, but I haven’t ever read the book.  In the spirit of scary things around Halloween, I thought I would give it and the sequel, “Dr. Sleep” a read.<br /><br />I always wondered about the title of the book, and I was happy to find out that King defines it in one of the opening chapters.  This was a fast-paced story that touches on the terrible effects of alcoholism and the inner demons that drunkenness can unleash.  King does a good job of unlocking those demons in the character of Jack Torrance as he struggles with sobriety and an evil force at the fictitious Overlook Hotel in Colorado.  Jack comes to find the hotel has a dark past and some of those demons work through Jack in a terrifying chain of events.<br /><br />I rated the story four stars because it felt like King left a few things unanswered as to the history of the hotel surrounding a reoccurring owner and the nature of Jack’s friend that was influential in Jack taking on the caretaker position at the hotel.  The story includes some frightening sequences, profanity, and graphic violence, so some readers may want to shy away from this type of story.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book.  It was interesting to learn about the history of the hotel and to see how King used Jack’s past alcoholism and potential relapse as a means to fuel the dark things that lurk at the Overlook Hotel.  The endings of King novels often leave me a little unsatisfied, but I thought this one tied things together well, and made for a good story!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My nephew loved this.<br />He and his dad build it in a week or so.<br />Amazing amount of parts and figures to play with.<br />I wish I was a kid again to build this and play with it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|You pay 7 bucks for a game that isn't complete. I think the PC and Xbox versions are amazing, but for mobile, Survivalcraft is where its at.<br />Minecraft pocket edition has small worlds and lack of pc elements. Change that and I'd buy pocket edition for the pc price at $26.
B008JFUO72|5.0|The movie arrived right on time and it was brand new. The movie itself was in very good condition. I love the Iron Man series
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Hmmm . . . Tarantino is just about my favorite. Only, this film wasn't what I expected. I was thinking from all the hype that it was a film more about the reality of slavery in this country (which, admittedly, it did touch on) and less about the hollywood love story complete with beautiful/handsome leading lady/man. Just not what I was looking for amidst the gore (whew! that was a LOT of overdone blood spurting and gore gathering! I was not squeamish but kinda amused . . . too much). Great acting by some. Like it.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|enjoyed the acting, and the story  do not ask for more words as i do not have any...this is a waste
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|As a fan of Malcolm Gladwell I can affirm that a blend of \\"Tipping Point\\" and \\"Outliers\\", \\"David and Goliath\\" is another walk down the aisle of the very interesting.  It makes me wonder how long it takes to do all of the research he puts into his efforts.<br /><br />When you understand the 'inverted U' and why you may maximize your energies and resources, including wealth before it gets to be a burden is clever and unique way of looking at things.<br /><br />Take a disability or in some cases, bad decisions, and see what can happen.  You might be surprised, I was!<br /><br />Being an insecure person for most of my life I can relate to overcoming and focus, give it your best effort, because no one will do it for you.<br /><br />Great job, great read, loved it!<br /><br />Peace
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good movie zombie scenes was good and also plot was good left me wanting to see more I would recommend this movie as a must see
B000FC1RCI|5.0|What a wonderful book. Full of mystery I had to keep turning the pages. Best school book I've ever read.
B000IBVRQW|5.0|If you are in to period movies , you will definitely enjoy this movie. It was Helena Bohnman's first major movies it has alot of other stars you will recognize. It is pretty accurate as to plot and the 9 day reign of lady Jane Grey.
B0026772N8|5.0|What a fantastic novel. This book has had an enormous impact on how I approach problem solving, not just from a mechanical perspective but also from a design and philosophical perspective. It is primarily about overcoming ones own self doubt, which would seem simple but turns out truly is not. Read this book, you'll be a better person by the time you are done.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on facebook.  It is a challenge and totally entertaining.  I highly recommend this game to all.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|This was money totally wasted.  Could not get it to download.  I even removed all the other apps and STILL couldn;t get it to download.  Don;t waste your money.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is an awesome show! If you love Game of Thrones, you'll love Vikings and it's not an annoying copycat version. It is its own original show but of the same genre.<br /><br />Love love love.
1442300051|3.0|Book is interersting, but when listening to the audiobook, it's hard to get past the idiot who doesn't even know how to pronounce the name 'Lehman' !!  Really???
B00ESB75FA|5.0|This show is funny, and soulful without gettig sappy or over emotional, it grips your funny bone and shakes you to the core.<br />Season 9 is the senior season, we are already invested in their relationships and care for what happens next.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I love this movie. Now I know it is not exactly like the book and kinda corny but it is a fun movie to watch and enjoy!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Product is very high quality, has a nice weight to it and a very smooth sweeping motion. Movement seems to be excellent quality as well and will keep running if you decide to swap watches for one day. In a month's use i would say it loses perhaps three minutes or less. I would recommend to anyone who wants a great day/date automatic. Water resistance I have not accurately tested so far, but it can definitely be submerged five or six feet for quite a few minutes without any damage. Top notch timepiece plus the see-through back makes it basically great to look at from any angle. As a matter of fact, don't be surprised if you catch yourself admiring the movement occasionally to drive away minutes of boredom.
B00DDQTKHM|4.0|This is everything you need to know to get started in marketing and public relations for your own company. Really awesome!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I bought this for a gift to my brother it was a little more than I had hoped but well worth it for the blue ray
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I found the stats very fascinating! I am not done with the book yet, but I am excited to see how it ends.
B00B7ERH04|5.0|My grand daughters use this to make their own photos when they play dress up with my hats and jewelry.  They really love it because it is to use.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love this series, very entertaining went to fast, we'll probably watch it several more times, can't wait to see season three!
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|My grand daughters love to take turns &#34;doing their nails&#34;.  I like this game because it allows them to be as creative as they want to be without having a BIG mess to clean up after they finish.  We all love this game.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|Our favorite TV show, the only problem we had is we like the show so much we watched to many shows at once and before we knew it the series was over!
B005HJWWW8|3.0|I'm using this with a Lenovo work computer because the computer does not put out enough power from the headset jack to power my Beyerdynamic DT770 headphones (high impedance) sufficiently loud.<br /><br />I have to run the FIIO E6 at the highest volume setting and the computer volume nearly at highest. I'd estimate the FIIO adds about 15 dB to the level. It is loud enough most of the time, but no reserve. At least I won't damage my hearing.<br /><br />As for the EQ setting, the flat and the blue settings sound okay. The bass boost (red) setting seems to make the sound muddy, and the purple setting (-20dB), what's the point? The whole purpose of this device is to boost a weak signal.<br /><br />I don't like having to hold the power slide switch for three seconds to turn the unit on and off.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Loved it. I read this book in highschool and was happy to see someone made a mini series from it. This story was just as depressing as the book. It was well done.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Everything is topnotch about this series. You do NOT love the characters but they are well portrayed. This is a well told tale of Washington underhanded plots. A textbook plan for promoting your own political goals. Do not try this at home.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love this game but it's too tricky and is very very addicting...sometimes I feel like it's a money issue in order to get to next board
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Great actors if you love indie movies or comedy horrors you'll love this and watch it all day err day :) enjoy
B006XOBFJC|5.0|This is my first complete cycle. I have a number of other recordings of the various parts of the cycle, and most have elements that I love; but as a complete set, the enormous variations in style and interpretation really don't work. This recording, conducted by Marek Janowski, is wonderful. The sound is bright and clear and the interpretation mercifully free of any extremes in artistic licence.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fine recording of the ring cycle at a very reasonable price - look no further.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|I can not retrieve my armies.  Every time I go to the army tab the game crashes.  I can not reach any support for help. I have uninstalled the game with no luck. O need help
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love the addicting quality of the game! It even makes it easy to learn several languages at once! Far better than Rosetta Stone
0821221841|5.0|A good general discussion of the operating principles of cameras and the different types. Even thought today virtually everything is digital, anyone would benefit from reading the works of this great master.
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|Excellent as Always true to the spirit of the songs with some artistic freedom of expression.<br />His playing has always amazed me and this is no exception!
1594489505|5.0|This is possibly the best book I have read lately with the exception of his other two!  His writting is beautiful and descriptive and the characters come alive.  I cried and laughed and thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Highly recommended
B00BCOQSSQ|4.0|The title of the book is very apt. Being &#34;The First&#34; of what appears - to me - to be a journey that will only gather momentum & more &#34;fleshing out&#34; of characters, places & plot.<br /><br />The choice of first person narrative helped me sink into the story from the beginning. The pace is good, with no lengthy & dull extra &#34;filler&#34; to wade through. That said, I would have liked a little more time spent on certain characters & also explaining why such arcane &#34;College Clubs & Annual Games&#34; existed in this/our world. But - this IS the first of a long series, & I was pleased overall that Roy Huff created a very neat starter.<br /><br />Definitely within the YA realm, an advanced reader would fly through it in a pleasant few hours. Summary - a good length, good start to this series & I look forward to the &#34;next round&#34;.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|Intend to buy more! Great accessory gift for Fujifilm Instant Mini 8 camera and also a must buy to go with.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Good romance story with a strong meaning for women to remember there are still good men out there so u never have to believe you have to stay in an abusive relationship.  A fast read
B0040I09RM|4.0|I love motorcyles....wish I could ride them. I think this series has a certain grit to it that makes it seem real. I really enjoyed all of the characters.......they all add to the storyline. There is no series like it!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It starts off fairly interesting but I thought towards the middle it fizzled out somewhat.  I'm a big SK fan but it's going to take a lot for him to beat The Stand which I think is his best!
B00C5R8364|5.0|A great read and couldn't put it down.  I feel this story line could be actually true in real life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! Spend too too many hours playing this game! Very very addictive...Can't stop playing.Try to play one game and am still at it hours later!
B007UXTG8M|3.0|High quality all round, but too dark for me. Fassbender's bum features quite a bit, which is a welcome attraction, but otherwise I found it too lacking in hope.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy was amazing I would like to see more of Christians point of view. About his past and what else was going on in his mind .
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Nice to get some back story. I liked the variety of characters. I always enjoy the the rich and detailed animations. I love Sci-Fi.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love this game have it on my iPhone had to get it on kindle love the realism of this game.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I wa so looking forward to using this device. After hooking it up we could not get it to work. We then called chromecast  for help.<br />We spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone with the helpline. At the end, the device showed a red light and the help line said it was now broken. She told us the device needed to be within 20 feet of our router. If this is true it certainly wasn't marked on the info I read. I was very disappointed. Will look around for another device  that we might be able to use.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start this game you can't put it down! Every level gets more amazing and then another and another
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Very good remake. Lots of action. Good casting. Done well visually. Dialogue isn't great but its and action movie. Overall would rent again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so so so much fun!! I have been playing this game for hours and will definitely be playing many many more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it....keeps me busy ... some levels are so much fun but some are very frustrating... either way i do love the game as it mostly fun and entertaining
B004UNX1LS|3.0|I enjoy the high quality of the videos I have seen so far. My HD tv totally comes into its own when viewing these videos. Clear crisp viewing with great sound as well
B0067Q42BY|5.0|If you like Mahjong, you will want this in your collection to. A lot of levels and layouts to choose from. I would recommend this app
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I'm certainly glad that I waited for Netflix.  This had to be a vanity project for Will and Jaden.  I made a joke about M. Night in the title but really it appears the story or lack there of can be laid at the door of Will Smith.<br /><br />I love scifi and I found myself dozing twice!!!  It was a boring story with poor acting and an unexplained deaus ex maschina to save Jaden's butt.  I would go into the plot but I'm afraid my description would make it sound like a much better movie than it is and might entice you to pay someone to see it.<br /><br />I usually love Will Smith but he phoned in his whole performance.  He was as wooden as the CGI trees in the forest.  This made Hancock look like Oscarbait.<br /><br />'After Earth' you'll have an uncontrollable desire to see a real sci fi movie like 'Gravity'.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this app a lot, you can play your music to help you fall asleep. You can dim the brightness. I just look at the seconds ticking by and it helps me to drift off into a deep sleep. I would recommend this app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two... Couldn't put it down !!!  You are hooked from the first page! A must read..... Can't wait for #3.
B001LMAK88|5.0|This is a great movie to watch. It has alot of great seinery and good acting and storey content. I have watched this movie serveral times already and recommend everyone to enjoy!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun challenge! Although can it be aggravating, but that's because I'm impatient. Would recommend this game to anyone who is interested.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|I enjoy the game, but as I jumped to higher levels, I couldn't believe as I watched rhe computer cheat. If I am winning, when I reach the home board, I may roll doubles, but they are ones or twos. My non double rolls are often one and two or three. The computer meanwhile rolls 2-3 sets of double fives or sixes when it reaches the home board. It only rolls double ones when it is down to the last 2 points. Its'' final roll is very often a double that saves it from a loss by removing its' final four buttons, while my last button sits near or on the last point waiting for my turn. This has happened over and over, and are not isolated incidents. I have actually started quitting the game when the CPU hits its' third high value double in quick sucession
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome there's always new updates New boards New people and is really really addicting what else could you want from a game
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Honest and beautiful, no longer than a memoir should be (there should be a rule limiting the length of memoirs).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was great.  So many things happened that will change the family forever.  Can't wait for Season 4 in January.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|This game is fun to play, although if you're like me, and want a &quot;free&quot; game to really be free, then it can get a little frustrating.  The more advanced armors arereally expensive (in stark credits) to activate and build.  If you aren't going to spend actual money to get them, you'll have to play it A LOT.<br />I had earned quite a few armors, and then one day, an update reset everything, and I lost all that I had earned.  only support online is list of FAQ's.  I tried submitting a support request, but zero response.<br />Just beware, if something happens to your saved data, you're on your own.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Th focus is more on the story than the zombies; which is ok.  Brad Pitt did a fine job.  Worth watching.
B000ID3KU6|4.0|Along with Shane, the best western ever filmed. Best Fonda portrayal since Grapes of Wrath. Bronson and Robards give electric performances. Cardinale is great and I'm always happy to see Elam with those sinister eyes.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It's been a while since I have read classic Stephen King , as I know and love his work.  Doctor sleep was awesome!  I was left wondering, how in the world does he think up such things?  I hope he lives to be a thousand, so he can keep up his donation to the literary world, his excellent work!!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was well filmed. The actions of the zombies were very interesting. There's nothing worse than fast zombies!<br /><br />I would recommend.
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Love these actors!  Classic Forever!  I would recommend this movie to others because it does keep your attention. Enjoy the movie.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I will never listen to music the same again.  They seem to be a little lacking in the low end but it more than makes up for it in comfort and clarity.
B000K3HTRY|4.0|it was interesting, well done but not too obscene, and i didn't know James Spader could be, in his own way, attractive.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first book: awesome<br />Second book: good<br />Third book: way off the mark.<br /><br />I feel like this couldn't figure out which way to go, so it went in circles.  Could have been so good, even with the craptastic ending, but I found it really disappointing and anticlimactic.  Kept skipping forward to see if it would get good, but never developed.
B000HL09MG|3.0|this movie is well done and full of symbols and extra meanings. it was also...haunting. It's a sad day when a person realizes that what movies depict are a short cry from just how evil and dark the underworld of our society can be...this movie shined a light on it, too bad the producer lost his life over it...
B00EZPCZ5O|4.0|AFI fans have learnt to keep their expectations for new afi music in check over the years. Or even have no expectations at all. So when I gave the record a spin on the way home from work I was quite pleased to discover that Burials is a genuinely good record. In fact I haven't been this excited about AFI in a while. I've listened to hit constantly the past few days.<br /><br />Davey and Jade tapped into inspiration that seemed missing in the fairly by the numbers Crash Love. It's alot more cohesive as well in that it really feels like an album and not just a collection of songs.<br /><br />Sonically, they retain the melodic elements of the last two records, but bring in a lot more raw energy. There's some big choruses that will be reminiscent of AFI of old, but not quite the once signature gang vocals they were known for. Unsurprisingly there's the electronic elements, but they haven't just shoe horned Blaq Audio into AFI. It's quite distinct here on burials, adding plenty of atmosphere to the songs.<br /><br />Best songs: I hope you suffer, 17 Crimes, Rewind, Anxious,<br /><br />But honestly all the songs are good.<br /><br />4.5 stars
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sad for this season to end because now we're caught up and have to wait until season 4 begins. So much has happened - can't wait to see what else they have planned for the families.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this is the best app for downloading YouTube videos.I use this app every day. without this app I would not be able to watch on my funny YouTube videos
B00F88H5K2|5.0|But I really don't know Liberace.  I am too young to really remember him.  I kind of remember my grandmother watching him and thinking 'this dude is gay, gay' and her not seeing that.  Either way, it's a fascinating review of a the man.  Some of things he did in private are jaw dropping.  Of course, this could a Joan Crawford type bio but if it is its missing the 'no wire hangers scene.'  Either way, I found this to be a very entertaining movie to watch.  It taught me something about the man and the period.
B0078X2LKY|4.0|Good book for my 2 yr old....he laughs every time we read it together, would definitely recommend to all...love Grover
B0010SKUYM|5.0|While only the first two books are published so far, this is quickly shaping up to be a great series.  Rothfuss is creating a really unique and interesting world and doing so in such a way that the reader is drawn in and feels like they understand it easily.<br /><br />I'm definitely putting Rothfuss on my list of authors to watch for new releases.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great app its very similiar to the one i play on my computer. I would recommend this app to my friends
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I don't know what took so long to get Candy Crush on my Kindle, but it works great and hooked up to my facebook progress with no problems.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read....would recomend this book to all!!  If you don't own  it you should.  Borrow it if your in amazon prime.
0316055433|3.0|I won't go into the plot since everyone will know it. My concern whenever I'm given or purchase a very long book is, \\"Will it keep me engaged?\\" and is it worth the weeks it will take me to finish it?\\"<br /><br />The answer with THE GOLDFINCH is \\"Yes!\\" and \\"Sorta!\\"<br /><br />To me, the book is divided into sections or novellas--the explosion, living with the wealthy family, moving to Vegas, etc.<br /><br />The brilliant opening section immediately kept me engaged--I think the explosion and Theo's experience and recovery is some of the best writing I've read in years.<br /><br />The family he moves in with may remind you of THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS or Salinger's Glass family. They are funny, a bit tragic and sort of odd. The father especially--something about his behavior seemed a bit \\"off\\" as did his wild dialogue; it didn't seem at all \\"real\\" in a novel that's very grounded in reality. (It's revealed later why he behaves this way.)<br /><br />The next--and for me, strongest novella--takes place in Las Vegas where we \\"live\\" with Theo's father and girlfriend. The writing is vivid, the characters and plot really move along and it's all terrific.<br /><br />And then, for me, THE GOLDFINCH seems to stall a bit and slightly loses its way. This painting that Theo carries with him seems to be forgotten about and then every 100 pages or so is mentioned again (not that we care.)<br /><br />There's a novella about dealing in art (collection and deception) and our hero takes a downward turn, but I found myself losing interest and by page 600 was growing impatient for it to end...or for the plot to kick in again as it did in the first few sections.<br /><br />The great thing about this book is that you can set it aside for a few days and pick it up again and not be \\"lost\\"--the writing and characters are that strong. The \\"plot\\" on the other hand seems to grow thinner and less important as you head down the last 200 plus pages as \\"big issues\\" are thoughtfully woven in.<br /><br />I'm sure this will receive many 4 and 5 star ratings, but I'm giving it a very good solid 3 since, unfortunately, it seemed to run out of gas toward the end. But those first 600 pages -- great, great stuff!sure this will receive many 4 and 5 star ratings, but I'm giving it a very good solid 3 since, unfortunately, it seemed to run out of gas toward the end. But those first 600 pages -- great, great stuff!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! My favorite game is on Kindle, just wish the updates were as fast as on my pc. Need more levels please!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie to add to your collection. Entertaining and a good magic mystery.  It's a good example of misdirection. The movie is lighthearted and fun.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|This movie will never get old no matter how many times you watch it. One of John travolta best movies. ..
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|A great book that had me smiling, chuckling, and dare I say laughing out loud at a person with Asperger's syndrome.<br />Here the principle character is a fish out of water in a world that  he cannot truly relate too. Yet with a pluck he attempts to interact with the status quote world and often comes out the hero. By show casing such a character the author lifts the veil on this personality disorder and thru humor makes home a part of our community. Just one with a few more quirks then most of us &#34;normal&#34; ones.
B00EOFIYZA|1.0|I love Ellie, but I agree with several other reviewers. It's insulting to fans to expect us to re-purchase the entire album for 10 new songs. It's just not cost effective. It would be good to release the new songs separately.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read all of Kings book.  So glad we were able to find out what happened to Danny.  Read this book in a week!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this often since my Kindle lives next to my bed at night. I like the weather features as well. This app is worth the effort!<br />THANKS
B004ADF7RO|4.0|One of those movies from my childhood that I thought my kids would love...and they did.  My boys love adventures.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Great movie.  Plenty of action with out blood spurting everywhere and humor mixed in at times.  Good entertainment for an evening!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Intriguing interactions between characters. It is fascinating to watch the interpersonal conflicts and how easily these people lie to each other  Also enlightening to see how high powered corporate attorneys function. Great looking actors and awesome wardrobe!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wonderful, I bought four pieces for my family and my friends ........Everybody love it . Thanks you Google Chromecast .
0811879631|5.0|This book is amazing, is a very good place to take references of colors. But it doesnt have much letter, has just a few pages to read.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Fun movie, stuck to the same basic storyline as the book.  I watched it twice.  Not epic, but very cute.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Splashing remote desktop hd and all the other snapshots creations are truly a piece of art never before has it been so easy to connect to my computer when I am not near it. I love this product and can't wait to see what is next for Splastop.
B004NS710C|4.0|Nice movie, Denzal Washington could be better than that, and I think they need a better reason to make the train runaway.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|The level of detail is great, it's really a fun, if not exact, model. If you like VW buses and Legos, you'll love this. Probably not suited for young children.
0399255370|5.0|This book came highly recommended by my hairdresser, who has a 3-year old grandson. I read through a LOT of the reviews & was sure this book would be perfect. My husband read it from cover to cover the day it came in and no doubt, it WAS perfect.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|This is the best Yall-ternative there is. just a great band with a great album. They will be huge someday!
076115728X|5.0|This book was recommended on amazon when I ordered another great book, &#34;The Day the Crayons Quit&#34; for our 3-year old grandson. I read through a LOT of the reviews & was sure this book would be perfect for our 2-year old granddaughter. My husband read it from cover to cover the day it came in and no doubt, it WAS perfect. It's made of sturdy material and every page has pieces to lift up revealing something you can do to make those Oops! moments into something creative. I highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game. I love playing it. all the updates are great. you all ways adding new thing and levels. this is a must play gamrle
B003DDKAT2|5.0|One of the greats. Strong cast of actors and storyline. Classic, they don't mane these like they use to anymore.
B00448VST6|3.0|I guess you can say that, this was a different twist on on early self doubt. Whatever it is, I didn't hate it.
B006671NPM|1.0|Beware if you are purchasing for the 3D; this movie does not ever have a 3D scene; you can watch the entire movie without the 3D glasses.  Only the pop up menu is in 3D.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|first of all thank you for all the scenes in spain!! it was amazing! thank u secondly 2 beautiful young girls ho decide to go on a little adventure for a weekend and then starts the love affairs. lots of suspense and lots of sex. but it had a good story line and kept my interest all the way  to the end and I really didn't want it to end but I rarely want any woody allen movies to end
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Bought this because have owned other HPphoto smart printers that performed well & were very easy to use. This one has lived up to that description. The wireless feature was very easy to set up with my laptop and tablet.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Hysterical animated film.  The cutest monsters which looked like stuffed animals.  Loved it. Watched it twice.  Excellent film for the entire family.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was such a page turner. I wasn't expecting the turn advents that are laid out in this book and because of that, it was hard for me to put it down! It was heart pumping and had you guessing the whole time through. And I loved the ending of the book! I can't wait to read more books from this writer.
B00EU98VVC|4.0|I had never heard of Tyr before.  I truly do love the first 5 songs on this album.  The rest are kind of throwaway for me.  The cover of Cemetery Gates is solid, but it just makes me want to listen to the original.  Same with the Iron Maiden cover.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga just never ceases to amaze me:  her creativity, her master of the language and music...she's an extremely, eccentric young woman.  I can just listen to the CD over and over again!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent idea to expand on his hit, The Shining.  Captivating read, I can hardly put it down. Could there possibly be a sequel?
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I loved the movie and the soundtrack just as well!  Both, Cher and Christina Aguiliera are strong performers and superstars!
B008EL25LE|4.0|This game is so mind boggling.  It is really a game that you have to keep doing to find out what the end results are.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|AWESOME GAME!!!!!!!!!!! Thrilled that's it's finally on kindle! I've been waiting forever for kindle to make this game available and now they have!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I had heard about this game but had not tried it before a few months ago.  It is a good game, frustrating at times and very addictive!!!
B00A285OOW|5.0|I enjoyed the continued saga of the Cousin's War from the perspective of the women of the era.  The research done to create this book is evident in the story.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Very good, I am getting ready to read his next book.  I always enjoy reading Nicholas sparks, have read all his books.
1476727651|5.0|One of the better King books of late.  Since he retired he has come out with some very good books
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Blazed through the first book and couldn't wait for the second. Great YA.The characters are angst ridden teens and the storyline was fun. Wonderful series for any teens you may know. I have and will recommend these.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|Even more astounding than 'Hiromi, Live In Concert' and Hiromi's Sonicbloom Live In Concert', in my opinion, 'Live In Marciac' builds up song by song with seemingly endless power and momentum! Hiromi is not only in splendid form, but here she clearly demonstrates that she must have spent some years secretly living in Chicago, Louisiana, and other places in America living, studying, feeling and experiencing jazz and blues!<br /><br />I'm kidding of course, but when you hear her beautiful, touching, soft and moving jazzy interpretation of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Pathetique, as well as some of the gorgeous blues that follows in one of the last songs, you may be surprised at how much she obviously loves and feels the stuff!<br /><br />I know there are different styles of piano music, of course, and different types of players, but watching this I can't help but think that she is the finest pianist (overall) on the planet! Certainly many will probably acknowledge that Hiromi is one of the finest, (if not THE finest), 'technician' on the instrument, so to speak, but upon hearing this DVD, and how she plays blues and jazz with so much pure emotion, feel and soul, certainly makes me think that there may be no finer, although there are some great 'classical' pianists out there that may be better in that particular genre. I haven't mentioned 'fusion' or 'rock', but there's obviously no need to! And, getting back to 'classical', should Hiromi ever feel like releasing a few classical albums someday, I'm sure she'll keep up with the best there too! Finally, her 'touch' and phrasing, dynamics and so forth- I won't even get into how incredible that is! Surely someone has already talked about that!<br /><br />Then there's one of my favourite drummers, former Jeff Beck alumni, Simon Phillips, who also gets better with each succeeding song, playing several brilliant solos!<br /><br />Finally, we have Anthony Jackson, constantly switching between pick, fingers, and thumb on a six-string bass utilizing all to create various tones, along with playing chords when needed. But mostly, I like the 'depth' of the way he plays bass, particularly on the 'low' notes. Anthony also plays one of the most unusual bass solos I've ever heard near the end of the show going where he feels to the point where you think he'll miss the reoccurring accents with the band. But does he? Never!<br /><br />By the time the concert was done, I felt that feeling of complete exhilaration and satisfaction, when one experiences something remarkable!<br /><br />There's also a nice documentary following the three around throughout Europe. One humorous bit has Hiromi standing in the doorway of the stage entrance, about to go on to do the concert and holding Anthony Jackson's bass (statue-like), until Anthony arrives, perhaps having forgotten something. Hiromi is motionless, holding it at certain precise points according to Anthony's instructions, (likely in order not to put it out of tune just before the show), and remarks something about being \\"frozen\\" like \\"Harrison Ford!\\" Simon passes, and remarks that he hopes that moment was captured on film!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great follow up to book one. Kept my attention and looking forward to book three.A great purchase for any teens that enjoy reading or adults that enjoy YA novels. I have and will recommend these.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am loving it. perfect for me as a fun amusing game that keeps me playing another game then another then...........
B00EZZ77ZM|4.0|Love JJ!!! Another great album. Shot reverse shot is a great song. Super funky!  Must have for Jack Johnson fans.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Great book - really kept me interested. It is amazing how these things can be occurring in this day and age, in another side of the world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I only could play candy crush on my parents phones and I couldn't play on my Kindle. But FINALLY it's on the kindle. I think candy crush is a really good game
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Makes writing anything much easier and accurate. It is less annoying than build in auto spell and keyboard from Google. I have used swype before, and I find SwiftKey better. It's a must have app for me now.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I have not seen any to let me know if it is better or the same as the other one that I have
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Everything was ok. and the best part is that the shipment was free, so the price was more than attractive for me. I wish there were more auctions like this, but I will check for it.
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|A must read for anyone involved in or pursuing Project Management. The reality of contract management with government entities is brought into the light of day...
B006FH2W4O|5.0|The fantastic details of life at sea. Historical accuracy and story telling ability. Just like all his books. Worth reading more than once.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Never expected to like this. My wife wanted to see it so I went along with it.We have watched it 2 more times since then.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I was first attracted to this game by how colorful it was.  Decided to download it and I am so glad I did.  It is a puzzle game that makes you think about the moves you need to make  to clear the board.  It takes some strategy but is so much fun.  Finally a game with a different twist.
B001BANK32|4.0|This is a great book! I couldn't put it down. This is so much better than the movie. Now on to the sequel ...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo blitz it is my favorite game next to bingo blitz.. it is so much fun and many games to go to..l would recommend this game to everyone! go bingo blitz i give you 5 *****
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|With the conclusion to the Wolf Pack, this truly is the best movie of the three.  All the previous characters are brought back.  It is a fitting end and will leave you laughing.
B004UID2LC|4.0|this app is great! unlike other apps I have tried, it sends all downloaded music into your devices music library, where you can access it without Internet! the music isn't neccesarily the highest quality, but its youtube so that's what you should expect. my only complaint is that once you decide to download a song, it will not allow you to download it as a video and vice versa.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I love this gaming app.  Super fun with the kids 8 and under.  Sparkles, flash, and all that jazz!  Good stuff
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is so awesome thank you I love this game can't wait to the second one you need to down load it you won't be sad
B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Listening to AFI's Burials, I kept thinking that it manages to retain elements from their previous three albums without feeling old or formulaic.  Thematically, this album is as dark as the cover art, but it manages to balance all that heavy emotion with wonderfully catchy, and at times bouncy, melodies.  Somehow it is both grim and brooding, but still refreshing.  All in all, it is excellent work.  If you have enjoyed AFI's last three albums, this one won't disappoint.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Good game. Paid one with ads:<br /><br />AdMob,<br />AdSense and<br />MoPub<br /><br />I have a few free games without ads.<br />Beside that nothing special.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|The movie had good action and music, really excited our kids.  A few swear words, but for an action film it was not too adult like so many are.
B007SVPZMW|2.0|25 and more MB of the very poor game. Graphic are indeed lovely, bat I do not like to win constantly. The easy and the hard mode are the same. There are no challenging in this game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Found this program on the recommendation of a friend.  I am so glad she suggested it.  I really enjoy this show.  It is a great story line and a clean program.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very creative and fun looked for a good game and I  found one. want more like this one. worth the time.!
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|This is the best new show of the year, I can't wait for more, the show grts better and better every week you have to see it

B007WEQ3K8|1.0|If this app is to make you feel dumb then it has done its job. This didn't feel games to improve yourself,  but more like pass or fail tests. I will stick to luminosity.com
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|Philip Shane (Cary Grant) doesn't have a chance against the old fashioned girl from Upper Sandusky!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|The structure of this mystery was very interesting, even though the plot seemed fairly predictable.  I kept reading because of the structure, even after I had the ending figured out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you thank you! I've been waiting forever for candy crush saga to come to kindle. So excited!!! It's such a fun addicting game
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much. It was a nice easy read, and written very well. Perfect to take on vacation.
0241141125|3.0|It is a cute book and toy, just know that it is a mini book, not full sized, it is a board book
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|If you are using this for sports like football or hockey it sucks. Too jerky and is better to view on the laptop.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This free app is exactly the basic calculator that I needed. It is so simple to use and meets my basic math needs.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|THIS APP &quot;ROCKS&quot;! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! YOU WILL,TOO! I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,AND THE ELECTRIC GOES OUT ALMOST EVERYDAY FOR A SECOND OR TWO. NOW WITH MY TABLET, I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OVER SLEEPING,AND I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE THE NATURE SOUNDS... :)

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Where does Britain find and train all these clearly superior talents.  And could they please lend us more for better USA television.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's a great time killer game. Good to relax to when you would like to turn your brain off for awhile.
B000I8G5NA|5.0|My son watched Men in Black and asked me if we could get MIB 2. We enjoyed sitting down watching this movie. It made both of us (age 14, and mom) laugh out loud.<br /><br />Anyone who has looked into UFOs or Aliens in any way runs into accounts of mysterious men in black. They drive a black car, travel in twos and always wear black. Yet there is no proof they exist.<br /><br />This movie takes on this premise, that men in black exists and builds on that. But it is not creepy but flat out fun.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|enjoyed this as I have always enjoyed stephen's books...voraciously chowing through as fast as possible to reach the gooey center...so satisfying to get closure on the torrances after all these years. stephen gets better with age,which I thought was impossible.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|At times the descriptions were too wordy, almost to the point  of being seen as filler.  These are my four.

1478952733|5.0|Recently abandoned by his father, who moved out of the family home in Manhattan, Theo Decker, 13, and his beautiful mother are making it on their own in New York.  After Theo gets in a little trouble at school, he and his mother have an appointment at school to discuss his issues. With some time to spare before the appointment, the two stop off at the MET for a Dutch art exhibit.  Theo is not at an age where he appreciates fine art, but he does notice a pretty red-headed girl about his age and an elderly man who catches his attention. He is curious about the girl and the mysterious older man she is with.  So when his mom suggests they visit the gift shop, Theo declines to stay close to the young girl, and in an instant, his life is forever changed.<br /><br />After an explosion and the rubble which resulted,Theo is unable to get to the gift shop or locate his mother. He does find the now dying older man (Welty) who gives Theo a ring and tells him to take it to a place called, Hobart and Blackwell and to \\"ring the green bell\\", when he arrives.  Welty also tells him to take the small painting which had fallen to the ground after the explosion. The artwork is a priceless 17th century, one of a kind painting which depicts a little yellow pet finch that is chained at the ankle, \\"The Goldfinch.\\".<br /><br />Dazed in the aftermath, Theo now sees his life defined as \\"Before Mom and After Mom\\".  He is haunted by what has happened; he blames himself for his mother's death. Child protective services intervenes and Theo's journey to adulthood takes a most unconventional course.  From living with a wealthy school friend on Park Avenue, to being dragged off to Las Vegas by his loser, gambler father and his girlfriend Xandra, Theo's life is in chaos. The only comfort for him is, The Goldfinch painting, which he clings to like a security blanket.<br /><br />Theo has kept the painting hidden since the tragedy, for it reminds him of his mother.  But, what can a young man do with a priceless piece of art like The Goldfinch? For a number of years, he keeps it safe, and gazes at it occasionally in private, until years later when, a seedy friend from Theo's teen years in Las Vegas resurfaces in New York and has a plan.<br /><br />In The Goldfinch, the reader is transported on a spellbinding journey into the lives of The Barbours, the wealthy, Park Avenue family that took young Theo in. Hobie, the antique dealer and former business partner of the elderly man who died in the explosion, who gives Theo a place to live and work when he returns to NYC. There is also unpredictable Boris, who Theo befriends in Las Vegas after Theo's loser dad and girlfriend take him from NYC to live with them.  Both boys are left to fend for themselves, and except for the occasional left overs that Xandra brings home, their consumption seems to consist primarily of food they can steal or alcohol and drugs.<br /><br />Told from the first person looking back, The Goldfinch follows Theo from the ages of 13 to 27.  From New York to Las Vegas, back to New York and even on an international journey to Amsterdam.  The author creates a memorable cast of characters and imagery. The characters are so well drawn, the writing is fabulous and both colorful and suspenseful.  For me, it novel was, at times, an emotional journey. My heart went out to Theo, even when he made some poor choices along the way. I loved the way the novel drew me into the world of art, and although it can't be considered a happy story, it is a story that, for me, had a very satisfying conclusion.  So far it is probably one of the very best books I've read in 2013, even though it was well over 700 pages -- I never felt bored.<br /><br />Be sure to read this one.iceless piece of art like The Goldfinch?

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I choose this rating because not only do I love Bingo, but I love Bingo Blitz. Awesome I mean awesome I like the different rooms you can play in and the whistle's and horns, special affects that comes with the power ups just awesome I love it and I highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you don't like Bingo you will love Bingo Blitzz...5 stars I love it!!
B00CSA41FK|5.0|I purchased Rear Window (Blu-Ray) from the reviews but I was unprepared for the clear crisp picture of this blu ray release.  It is like you are in the same room.  You want to get a towel and wipe off the beads of sweat on James Stewart's head.  What was truly amazing is there is a scene in the movie where the actor Raymond Burr (suspected of killing his wife) is taking the jewelry out of her purse.  And you can see him pick up her wedding band - a perfect round wedding band and this is from the \\"rear window\\" of James Stewart's apartment.<br /><br />Absolutely amazing.  I have about 100 blu ray dvd's and I don't think one matches the clarity of Rear Window.  The transfer is perfect and that is rare today.<br /><br />Worth every penny as this is a \\"play it again\\" movie. And not to be forgotton is the beautiful Grace Kelly who appears more stunning if that is possible.<br /><br />If you love this movie - don't hesitate to get the blu ray version.  You truly won't regret it.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|OMG!! I love hidden objects love it, love it, I love it. I must give this game 5 stars, because I never had so many different challenges to a Hidden Objects game. I mean you have words on a stick, words on pedestals, scrambled  words, shapes to find, find in the fog, find before the bomb explodes, even find in the dark . And I have defeated them all, so Amazon please send more. If you like Hidden Objects I highly recommend that you grab Hidden Objects Quest 6. You're gonna be addicted. I am!!
B004XVN1T4|5.0|It started slow and confusing. But I knew Ken would not disappoint. As I read on, as usual it got to the point I could not put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Always loved this game on my phone and when I purchased the Kindle Fire, I was upset to see that they didn't support it.  Finally, they have it and I'm so happy.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This app does not work on my Kindle Fire HD.  The process does not complete to send request to printer.
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I struggled through the book for a while and finally tossed it aside.  Unappealing characters, rambling, ugly, and generally stupid.  Wish I could give it a quarter-star rating.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very good. Held my attention, although it did drag in a few places.<br />Not my favorite book by King, but definitely one of top 10.<br />Glad the ending was left open for a sequel.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant is probably more of a 3.5 rather than a 4 based on the writing and the story, but I rounded up because of the ending.  The book itself seemed a little clunky, with too much exposition, and a few too many plot inconsistencies.  The alternating points of view for each chapter didn't work as well as it might have; Tobias and Tris needed different \\"voices\\" instead of sounding like the same character. (This device works rather better on the audiobook, where we get to hear two narrators.)  The story does move along, but there's a sense of trying to do too much in too little space.  Maybe some of the world outside could have been introduced earlier?<br /><br />The ending flowed from the rest of the book, and made sense---Tris being Tris did what I would have expected her to do.  Too bad some readers can't deal with authors ending books on their own terms, rather than pandering to the expectations of the reader.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Although fiction, one wonders about adoptions in the past. We had an uncle who was an orphan, and when he was alive he would tell us how the nuns would put him out to collect money because &#34;he was the cutest of the lot&#34;.  He couldn't stand nuns from that point on.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Great story. Solidly entertaining from cover to cover. I highly recommend this book , whether you read The Shining or not.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|this is a great game. it just won't download on my kindle. that needs to be fixed and very fast.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|simply brilliant. 'nuff said. Highlights include<br />'And Yet,' 'The Night the Pugilist Learned to Dance'<br />.......hell it's all good. a step above 98% of today's<br />chart toppers.  Literate, lyrical, and beautiful.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Good fun game. Yeah well peace out . Lobe this game it's so<br /> Fun and great everyone should get this game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|A lot of fun, even with built in delays to nudge you to spend your way out of them. Just put the game down or turn the kindle off or switch to another app until the delay is over and then go back to it later. Still plenty fun without spending another dime!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|It works great - protects the head set when it is in my laptop bag and charges it too!  It is compact and reasonably sturdy.  No problems so far.
0375831002|5.0|Gave this a bad review because it didn't make any sense to me but I didn't understand that the narrator was \\"Death\\".  Once I realized that, it became an very captivating read!  It was still a sad book but it had a lot of redeeming qualities.  The movie is good too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|So easy to play and a quick get away. Just enough variations to keep me coming back for more.  Great . Goes anywhere
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I really like this language app. It's got a couple of shortcomings but not many. Occasionally it will ask you to translate a word it has never shown you. Also some grammar rules aren't explained very well. Takes a few times going through each one before you really get it. But that's language for ya. Otherwise it's awesome. I can now understand a bit of german. Enough that if I was dropped in Germany I wouldn't be completely lost. If someone spoke slow and clear in German to me I would be able to somewhat understand. And that's after just a few weeks.
B005V1WYZC|5.0|This a awesome DVD and it is one crazy mixed up family on this DVD, Really funny and silly at times but well worth the price, We all enjoyed it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a fun addictive game that I look forward to playing everyday.  It is a way for me to simply lose myself in a game.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I wanted to see what the hype was about so I downloaded the game.  I rate it with Fruit Ninja...just dumb.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|limited apps right now but, I hope it will just get better as more people show an interest! good deal!
B0000000LI|5.0|20 years old but live and the price was right.  Classic music by Yanni at his handsome sexy best and he can be heard making comments, too.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Not nearly as good as book 1. Some stuff gets a little too out of hand/fictional/&#34;this would never actually happen.&#34; But still a fast and good read.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I received this as a gift.  Basically you are supposed to be able to broadcast what you see on your computer to your television screen.  It has limitations, as the only thing I can get it to do from my Apple iPad is broadcast YouTube video.  An Apple representative emailed me saying this product is not currently supporting the iPad.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|I was skeptical to purchase the new album...After The White ST album I had thought the age of Korn was over. Upon Hearing that Brian Welch had returned I figured Id give it a Listen...WOW!!!!!! THIS IS THE KORN I remember...Its Heavy, Melodic and Dark...Jonathans Vocals are better then ever and show the heart that lacked in the last 2 records..Welch And Schaffer On the heavy 7 string attacks are just MIND BLOWING! They are back! And Hopefully theyre Here to stay! You will not regret this purchase if you are a true KORN fan
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game . Super addicting. It's hard not to spend real money when your &quot; So close, &quot; but out of lives.  Can't wait to beat more levels. Keep em coming.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I really liked this movie, I watched it in the airport and caught myself more than once laughing out loud.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love this version of Mahjong it will keep you entertained for many hours,with lots of different layouts! I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Mahjong!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a captivating drama with great sets, story and acting.  Although about a different time, country and class of people, it is quite believeable.  I love following both the aristocracy and the servants that serve the aristocracy and the social changes affecting all the people's lives.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Among the many things I like very much in this dramatic series are the presentation of relationships. The relationship between the two brothers in law, the sisters in law, the father and son and the relationship between Mr. White and Jesse which is clearly paternal as well as student teacher as well as confederates on a dangerous mission. The complexity of human relations is always interesting.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|Ireally liked this movie it was great seeing Arnold back on the screen.i'm looking forward to his new one with sly.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I find this drama fascinating. There are some that find the aura of menace that runs mostly below (but not always) the surface to be disturbing. What I like is the feeling that life is all too often like this. We get ourselves into predicaments for all the best reasons, even if they exhibit poor judgement, with the best of intentions. We cannot imagine what the consequences might be and then have to deal with them in order to attempt to keep the balance of our lives intact. I am fascinated by how the characters continue to exhibit real world dilemmas and values while confronting psychopathic realities and behaviors in others. The moral dilemmas and choices seem to constantly present themselves and their decisions either please or disappoint us, just like real people in real life.
B00F88H5K2|5.0|this movie was awesome! When watching the movie I felt I was actually watching Liberace behind the scenes. It is well worth watching.
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|It works like a loudness does on any stereo.  Wont shut off when not in use it continues to eat the battery on the phone.
B0012CH350|5.0|LEAVE THE GRILL OUTDOORS AND THIS FITS IT GREATLL  YES HAVE A WEBER AND LOVE COOKING OUT DOORS SO AM HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE, HAS STRETCH BO0TTOM WHICH HELPS KEEP IT ON IN WINDY CONDITIONS
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I can't say enough good about this show, Really keeps you attention and intrest.  MoOves so fast I have to rewind to catch things.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|And perhaps I should have given it five stars. Rutherford definitely provides an excellent view of London life down through many centuries, and he keeps the interested-in-London reader engaged. What I would have liked would be more of the historic backstory; he certainly does provide a lot of history, and weaves it seamlessly into the story; I just would have liked a little more. I like this book well enough that I would rather another of Rutherford's.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Season two is better than season one and I can't wait for seaon three. This show moves right along almost to fast!!  Things and people changing so fast sometimes is hard not to rewind and watch again.
0307352153|3.0|Although I was enjoying the content, I found the fine print hard to to deal with. Perhaps this should only be tackled with an e-reader.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I could stop watching!!!  Every turn you don't get what you expect adding to the plot.  Great acting and great story line!
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Fun game!  Sometimes it's hard to figure it out, but when I do figure it out on my own, I am very happy!  (No, I am not 5 years old ;-}) The only thing that I would change is the hint book.  I wish I could see the hints more than every 4 hours.  Some of the 'finds' are very very difficult to find without using the hint book.  Otherwise, it's a nice change of pace.
B00DU74U74|1.0|I'm a fan of syfi, however this isn't even a lame attempt.  This is one of the worst movie I've sat through...lame story, lame acting, lame plot.  Don't waste you time.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|GREAT adaptation of a great book.<br />James Caan and Kathy Bates are amazing! This is a must see! It is very creepy
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I am an avid Miley Cyrus fan. Although with her latest antics I was discouraged and nervous that this album would be a repeat of her Can't Be Tamed album, which I wasn't impressed with. I was skeptical when she said she named her album Bangerz because there are so many bangerz on it. Well Ms. Miley you were right and I should have never doubted you. She finally took control of her career and her music is better than ever. I have had this album on repeat since it's been released. I'm beyond impressed and can't wait to see what else she comes up with in the future. In a way the album has a variety of genres and it's different than a lot of the stuff artists are coming out with.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|All you hear is candy crush so I wanted to see what it was all about. It's a fun game to play. I'm still not sure what I'm doing but I seem to be advancing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think its a great game and you should try it one day next to the funny graphics and great motion control
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The author's character development is excellent. The interconnection between the characters can be a bit confusing at times but it all becomes clear soon enough. I hated to see the book come to an end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really Love the Candy Crush game. I can give the game 5 stars, but I don't like the fact that we have to purchase more lives. I am not doing very well getting lives from facebook, because I don't have but one friend. But all of that being said I am very glad that candy crush is on the Kindle.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|When I got to the end of the third book, I didn't want it to end.  I am so glad there is another one coming soon!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|What an enchanting show- I was so drawn in by the characters and the story. Thank you for this reality break!
1451629184|5.0|The delivery by Amazon was excellent ...this is a book every woman should read. It tells  story of an 11yr old child  enduring  horrific sexual  abuse ,at the hands of a MUNSTER called MAN.....I cryed reading this book...
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love the p interest app I'm always getting good ideas from boards and pins. Love it love it love it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up.  Make sure you know your router password before you start the process, though, as you will need to add the Chromecast to your wireless router.  Was a little glitchy and the Chromecast got stuck at 23% while updating.  I unplugged it from the power source and let it reboot.  That seemed to do the trick.  Really nice to watch Netflix on the TV and use my iPhone as a remote.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|The book was fast-paced.  The time warp aspect was a bit silly but you could overlook it due to the characters interaction.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this addictive game.  Would love to see more King games and facebook games available at the app store in the future.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|I was totally addicted throughout the series. I can not recommend it highly enough. The only bad thing is that I watched them all and there will be no more episodes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game with different features that distinguish it from other \\"You find it\\" games. As with any app some features and the speed of the game are dependent upon spending money but fun anyways if you're patient.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Bladerunner is a classic but DADES explores what defines a human being on a much deeper level. Anyone who loves Bladerunner should read this novel to understand what Dick was saying on this theme.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Suffice to say I am an avid Walking Dead Fan.  I own the first two seasons.  I have been viewing a few on Amazon because I missed them on TV.  Every episode is worth watching.
B00DSGT8RE|3.0|I've loved the Manics for years and a follower of all their albums and songs, and had the enjoyment of seeing them in Denver a while back during the \\"Plague Lovers\\" tour. This is a stripped down album, mainly unplugged, to give a very different and unique sound to their collection. There are more guest singers including Richard Hawley for \\"Rewind the Film\\" the title track. There is an amazingly haunting and beautiful instrumental tune on here called Manorbier. \\"3 Ways to Despair\\" possibly the best track on here and rates highly in the Manic's amazing collection. I also enjoyed the \\"I Miss the Tokyo Skyline.\\" This album is so unlike previous albums, and i can't say it is my favorite by far, but highly worth owning and having and I continue to enjoy listening. The second disc is one I haven't gone through yet- I believe they are live tracks and outttakes.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|this is a fun game and challenges you mentally and your ability to manipulate to get the birds to go where you want them to.
B00FITRTQ6|5.0|Haven't you read it, yet? Really?!<br />Oh, Jesus, you should!<br />Stefania is italian, but her English is excellent, and she's a talented writer.<br />The story is so good and well written that you would lose the track of time, while reading!<br />If you have a spot for crime novels, you'll definitely love it.... Guaranteed!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|This is a challenging game, as all angry bird games are.  It stimulates you mentally and your dexterity to maneuver the birds in the right direction.  Would recommend to anyone.
0470474874|5.0|This was recommended on an ED2GO class for Excel that I am currently taking online and is an excellent reference book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I could not wait until Kindle was able to offer this game.  I have it on my phone but so much nicer on some what larger screen.  It is lots of fun and very addicting.  The only thing different from phone to kindle game is on phone no matter how many times I fail it doesn't stop me from keep trying.  On my kindle seems after so many tries it stops you from trying until another day or hours or get help from someone on facebook.  i don't do games sharing on facebook.  So the delay on kindle is a little annoying.
B00FX8EY60|4.0|I'd rate this more at 3-1/2 stars. 3 feels too little, 4 too much. Ah well, what can you do?<br /><br />On the heels of her very public divorce, everyone knew to expect more serious tracks from Katy Perry. Serious PRISM is, though it lets up at least a few times (\\"Birthday\\", \\"Walking On Air\\", and \\"This Is How We Do\\"). Tracks such as \\"Ghost\\" and \\"It Takes Two\\" are set to a catchy pop beat, while remaining lyrically heavy. The hauntingly beautiful \\"By the Grace of God\\" may be one of the album's best tracks.<br /><br />PRISM suffers in one significant way - the tracks are tedious. Clocking in at 3.5+ minutes, some over 4, there are moments when the repetitive beats and wa-wa effects start to run together and make songs unmemorable. A couple tracks could probably have been thrown out to the album's benefit, though this IS the Deluxe version, and no one can fault Perry for wanting to give her fans as much material as possible.<br /><br />Anthemic \\"Roar\\" has already proven a success. \\"This Is How We Do\\" has perhaps the highest potential for a crowd-pleasing single; it is incredibly reminiscent of \\"California Gurls\\". There is more 80's dance fun to be had in \\"Birthday\\" and \\"Walking On Air\\", and \\"Dark Horse\\" is a fun, funky break from the rest of the album.<br /><br />The tracks that aren't dance-worthy or cracking with post-breakup emotion are mostly forgettable. There is no \\"E.T.\\" here, no cheeky \\"Peacock\\". It should be mentioned, however, that PRISM becomes more cohesive on repeat listens. It's not an album stacked with breakout singles like \\"Teenage Dream\\", so listeners should give it more than one try before deciding how they feel. Perry seems to know this, as she encouraged fans via Twitter to \\"sit with the album\\".<br /><br />PRISM is a decent effort. The only truly unfortunate thing about it is that - unlike its name - PRISM doesn't seem to reflect much vibrancy. Fans may need a while to mourn the disappearance of gumdrop-sweet Katy and learn to embrace the more mournful, reflective Katy that PRISM presents.nful, reflective Katy that PRISM presents.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Another excellent plot by Nora Roberts. Love the development of the relationship between the main characters and the strong female lead.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|This app has a variety of activities to test math skills, memory and thinking skills at 3 levels.  I have only had it for 2 days now, but have had no problems using it on my Kindle Fire.  I gave it 4 stars rather than five because I could use more detailed instructions for some activities.
0767817729|4.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE AND THE SHIPPER GAVE ME EXACTLY WHAT I ORDERED...I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE WHO LIKES KEVIN COSTNER.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time I can get this on my Kindle!!! My phone dies so fast when playing, but not my Kindle!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Addictive, like every other Stephen King novel. Good plot, beautifull ending, and if you liked The Shining, you will just love Dr. Sleep.
B00FPGSPQU|4.0|Just as funny as before, a great ending to the first movies.  Bradley Cooper in those pants, yum yum.  Uproariously funny!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is really awesome and cool because you can easily die. And you can also do flips and other cool things.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Broadchurch is a very serious drama with strong characters.  I enjoy the actors and the accents although a little dark.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down!  Excellent plot development and character creation. I finished it in a day and a half.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent book!  Easy to read, got through the entire book in just a few days.  I love how the author mixes metaphysical principles with humor too!  My husband hates to read but he also enjoyed this book thoroughly.  I highly recommend this!
B000SW16NU|5.0|At times a little stiff, and glossing over on detail, I nevertheless find this to be an educational (showing the plight of religious differences and similarities that haunt the region to this day, plus the issues with travel and necessities of life like water), touching, and entertaining view of how it was possible for man to rise above the rigors of daily life and lack of education to show how actions can make up for these shortcomings in a person. The scene where Saladin suggests it would be better if Balian had not earlier been allowed to go free only to be told by the character who did so &#34;then I should have had a different teacher&#34; is poignant. Good exists in all men, even if &#34;sometimes they must do a little bad for greater good&#34;. This story shows that in spades.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My entire family (even the adults) realy love this show. We can't wait for more episodes! Please get more seasons!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and challenging. time passes quickly while playing this game. everyone I know is playing it. pass it on to your friends
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Total conquest is one of the better in a line of many build your city and war games available for android based devices.<br /><br />Pros:<br />MAde by gameloft (you can trust them not to steal from you)<br />Good Graphics<br />Easy to understand<br />Sound is not to annoying.<br />Has a leader board<br />Has a campaign mode where you do quest.<br />Battles are not just your troops vs theirs defenses and where troops are placed matter.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Has a serious pay to win function at least in begging, it may even out toward end game.<br /><br />Just so you know:<br />Its a time based game, that allows you to get ahead by buying crowns to finish items faster.<br /><br />Overall a good game sorta like clash of the clans or pirates tides of gold. I recommend it if your into that semi strategy type game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this read. The author keeps you guessing all the way trough; surpised be a bit towards the end. Recommend
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|It's big and noisy with robots, monsters, kung-fu, and the end of the world as we know it. What's not to like ?! Taking this movie &#34;seriously&#34; is a mistake, it's Ye Olde Fun-Filled and Action-Packed fare, with Ron Perlman !! I watched it three times, the third time was a bit too much but I still caught a few things I missed in the first two viewings. Recommended to all fans of kaiju. Seriously.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Kept me thinking all the way through the story! Great book to share with others, friends and family alike, to discuss.
B005BW0VI8|5.0|The best album I have heard in a long, long, time. Imelda May's voice is phenomenal and the guitar riffs are awesome!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved the story line.  Of course the minions are adorable.  I look forward to the second one.  Good family movie.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|All of the Harry Potter Movies are great and capture the main themes and scenes from the books.  These movies got my son reading this series and he is well past 2,000 pages now and is finally an avid reader.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Extra materials including excerpt of another Card book, and a Card commentary on this audio production. Is worth the price alone, interesting to note this is Card's preferred format for anyone to experience Ender's Game.

B004WMKXWM|5.0|Little darker than the others but as with all the movies very well made.  My son loves these movies and loves the books.  Movies got him reading the books and now he is an avid reader!
B0060ZJ78U|1.0|Love the movie and purchased it for my deaf father who read the book.  The closed captioning on it was not accurate and I had it for a long time before I gave it to him so I could no longer return it. Seems like it may be a pirated copy.  Went and bought it at the local market and the closed caption worked just fine.
0307352153|4.0|In a book full of studies and personal anecdotes, the most heartbreaking are those of parents who don't understand the personality and disposition of their child and force them into awkward, even damaging situations.<br />For instance, parents of an introverted child, new to a neighborhood asking their daughter on her birthday to take cupcakes to children she doesn't know in the hope she will make new friends and learn a lesson about giving. Those misguided parents in this example aren't in the book, I'm talking about my own family and my poor, introverted daughter.<br />I know this technique is a bit tired and hackneyed (\\"And that person....Was Me!\\") but in my defense, Cain uses the same technique in the book. But I think everyone, extroverts and introverts will find themselves in these pages and better understand their family, school and work relationships.<br />One of the most interesting thing I found coming from studies of introverts is the idea that most introverts are not just shy about new people, they tend to dislike new things in general. They tend to prefer taking their time getting to know new places and situations and prefer to study a few things in depth rather than many things superficially.<br />I was very pleased that Cain deals with the importance of these concepts in the church. There are churches geared to extroverts (loud, big mega-churches where everyone is expected to sing loud and hug the neighbor they don't know) and churches geared for introverts (small liturgical congregations where silence has a place along with a consistent order of worship.) But if we believe the church should a place that, according to the Apostle Paul in Galatians 3:28 has \\"neither Jew nor Greek, male or female, slave or free\\", than we probably should find a way that it includes introverts and extroverts.<br />Among the many fascinating studies mentioned in the book, I was very interested in a study of phone conversations. It was found that when introverts and extroverts talked on the phone, extroverts were much better at determining if the person they were talking to was happy or sad. But if introverts and extroverts were listening to two parties in a taped conversation, introverts were a little better at reading the mood.<br />Of course, there are strengths and weaknesses to all personality attributes, but we need to realize we need each other, learning to adapt and learn from each other. This book is a good place to start if you haven't given these issues a lot of thought (this probably means you, fellow extrovert.)rts talked on the phone, extroverts were much better at determining if the person they were talking to was happy or sad.

B001ILFUDC|2.0|When I received this product the packaging was intact but you could hear that inside the DVD was moving around. Sure enough when I opened it up the inside case holding the DVD was all broken (didn't look damaged from exterior but could hear interior was damaged). Had to throw away DVD holder as to my DVD was getting scratched from all the broken pieces inside the holder. Very disappointed at how they shipped this product. Anybody handling it could tell something was wrong on the inside.
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I didn't care for the format. I found it hard to read.  The story was interesting though.  It was not my favorite of our book club choices.
B000003TAB|5.0|The octives in Kurt's voice on this album prove again how talented he was.  Wish he were here.  I've got to say my favorite song on this is &#34;Big Long Now.&#34;  Totally worth buying!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good read. Interesting plot. Lives intertwining, heartache and secrets along with the grief of losing a child. Would recommend highly.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This is a very surprising movie.  Trust me, if you haven't seen it, you've GOT to buy it.  It's probably not the type of movie you think it is; it's freakin awesome!  By the end of the movie, you're in shock.  A Good Shock.  It's my favorite of his work.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome devise, haven't gotten it to work with my iPhone but works great with my computer. Great for Netflix and YouTube. I like that you can cast a tab and keep doing other things while it plays on the tv.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|I love the fact that they made this movie together, both of them being so talented and beautiful.  The plot was absolutely awesome.  A real classic!
B00C2IPB66|5.0|I love movies but this one in particular surprised me with the ending that I would typically dislike but somehow they pulled it off REALLY well.  This is in my top 10 of all time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is scary .... Jessica Lange is off the hinges ... A sexy, crazy old lady who lives next door ... You know better Not to walk across her grass
B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|Miss Netrebko's voice is as lush and beautiful as ever in this Verdi album for sopranos.  A DVD is included with it, and shows Miss Netrebko in scenes from a number of different operas for which she is well known.  I highly recommend this set to all of her fans.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Thought this movie would be too serious and boring based on reviews, but it was a nail biter with amazing special effects, gorgeous cinematography, and good writing.
B00BT70J7M|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann has selected the best tenor arias in this album, and sings them with such fervor and excellence, it makes one's heart pound!  I highly recommend it.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I love The Star Trek: Into Darkness Starfleet Phaser Gift Set which includes a 1:1 scale replica of the Starfleet phaser, a gloss black display stand, a brass plaque and the Blu-ray 3D Combo Pack.
B00CPWTRAA|4.0|Mr. Domingo does an excellent job singing these Verdi selections in his early 70's, but the arias are for a baritone, not a tenor.  It takes some adjustment to listen to Mr. Domingo sing baritone after hearing him sing tenor for so many years, but he does a remarkable job, and still has a well-trained voice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun app. Great for kids and even adults. Had fun play with my almost 5 year old daughter. Very cute Minion's.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|This was a decent read but I wouldn't say I couldn't put the book down. While the characters were interesting enough especially the Knot's I felt they were not developed enough and despite their powers King decided to focus much more on the alcoholic struggle Danny faced , which i thought was a bit much. True this narrative showed his weakness and exposed an opportunity for exploitation used later in the book , but the finale was short and anticlimactic, a bit predictable and left me with a feeling of disappointment.<br />It is as if this book ran out of 'steam'.<br />I don't think I'd recommend it as a must read , but fans will likely want to consume this to see what Has become of danny.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|My husband has a penchant for choosing awful movies, but the male population might disagree. For me, even Jason Statham could not redeem the two hours lost.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked this book because it delved into the inner self and what makes people do what they do. It also showed how a split second decision can change lives forever.  Well written! Held my attention from the very beginning.
0810993139|5.0|Laughing out loud funny for our middle school boys. It's good to see their nose in a book and hear them laughing!
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|This isn truly a great piece and It makes me sad to know what a true talent we have lost!
0810970686|5.0|I work in a classroom with long term suspended middle school students. This series is the fastest chosen series of all of our books. I'm thankful for books with such great appeal and lots of laughs.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Another awesome album! Love Maroon 5, they have such diversity and I love their music!  Sexy and so real to both men and women! Thier music speaks to my heart.....
B003PIUBZS|4.0|great series,absolutely captivating. I would gladly recommend it to anyone that loves movies of that era. I'LL BE ORDERING THE LAST SEASON SOON
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Love, love love it!! Maroon 5 is one of very favorites and they have done it again with this awesome music! Adam rocks!!
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|I bought this Gizmo after getting the 6 inch smiling Gizmo and being VERY disappointed.  This one on the other hand, which is the same brand as the crappy smiling Gizmo, is fantastic!  He is the right size, fuzzy, so cute, and clearly better quality.  His singing sounds just like him in the movie, and his little swaying back and fourth (not quite a dance, but it'll do) so looks like Gizmo's mannerisms.  I bought this as a Halloween prop but he will be sticking around on display permanently.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This album is one of my very favorites! They all are an amazing talent and together they have great chemitry and I love them!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It is so addictive and I can't seem to stop playing it. Great game worth getting.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Tried to give it 5 stars but would only let me do 4 .  Love this game.  Finally I can play it on my kindle.  I use the kindle way more than my laptop.  THANKS
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga is amazingly addictive!!!! I couldn't have found a better game than this!!!! You HAVE to try this game!!!!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It looks awesome but it's not compatible with a kindle fire but maybe I'll find a different game like that
B00992CF6W|5.0|if any one knows when 0.7.7 is coming out please tell me<br />because I want to play on servers because 0.7.6 didn't add any thing and great game buy it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game. It's like I can't stop playing the game! I at least have to play this game for about five minutes before I'm happy!!!! Conversion LLC, I give a two thumbs up for this game!!! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read I couldn't put it down I read . It in three days!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I am twelve years old and I usually hate games like this. I usually have to pull up a walkthrough, but this game was very straight forward. Five star quality!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is my favorite game...finally on kindle yay...I get stuck on levels for weeks...but its all good...we all come back for me...I wish we had more lives though
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I think this game is a good adaptation of the computer version and has also played very well so far and i have had no issues so far
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I love the songs on the cd and Katy Perry has amazing voice. Plus I liked the fact she came out with the deluxe cd instead of waiting. I would highly recommend this cd to any Katy Perry fans
B005PK1G76|5.0|Omg, I don't know how I lived without the Diono Buddy Stroller Organizer. It's compact, yet fits all my necessities, so I don't need to carry a purse on a quick grocery run anymore. When I collapse my Graco stroller, I don't have to remove it, it stays right on. It's a simple design and not to mention affordable.
B002DPRLEI|4.0|Rock Hudson, Doris Day, Tony Randall, Paul Lynde. Cute show and a great clean, classic comedy! Rock Hudson plays a hypochondriac who misinterprets the doctor and believes he is dying. He enlists his BFF, played brilliantly by Randall, to help him find a sufficient husband for his wife, played by Doris Day. It's one big misunderstanding after the other and comedy ensues throughout. Comedy as it was in the early 60's: simple, clean, and easy to enjoy.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The game is great the only problem I have is trying to purchase stuff from the bank like more crystals, other that love the game
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I didn't get  a chance to use it, because the app wouldn't downloaded. I deleted the app from my phone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was challenging but at the same time my six year old was able to do it with me.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Here is finally an update. After co-op, i didn't think it could get better. Now that they added the bloonchipper, its loads more fun.
0679720200|5.0|The reasons for out existence is questioned. Religion is also questioned. What more can you want from a book? These two questions are the mystery that never ends.  You will be surprised how this story take its shape.  You will be surprised.
B00AEFY66U|4.0|I found MacDonald Carrey's interpretation of Carraway (w/Alan Ladd, 1949) better than the subsequent portrayals, especially this weak and watery one by Sam Waterston....Redford and Mia Farrow make this movie, literally, but I still find Ladd's straight-on portrayal of Gatsby as the gangster-turned-patrician the best, followed by DeCaprio's newest one, and then Redford's. I am speaking only of the actors' differing interpretations of the character, not of their ability. Redford is great in any context, but Ladd and DeCaprio are better tough-guys with the patrician's veneer.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|very challenging game, though it takes a while to recharge your energy. it would be better if hour could play continuously.
B0088O11NU|1.0|I refused to allow this to get into my contacts then I couldn't play. It all seemed too ....I deleted it
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, though it wasn't worth $4.99. The premise was interesting but there were serious problems with the science.<br />I'll try not to give away too much of the plot.<br /><br />First there was the idea of the asteroid storm. I understand the idea that the space ship's drive deformed the fabric of space and could disturb local objects such as asteroids. However, it seems unlikely that the mass of the ship would cause a deep enough gravity well to cause a cloud of asteroids to smash into the ship.  It reminded me of an old Flash Gordon episode, though the special effects were much better.<br /><br />Second, the idea that 1000 years had passed since humanity had left earth seems far too short a period of time for the evolution and spread of the diverse life forms portrayed. Here again, the CGI is good.<br /><br />As for the acting: Jaden Smith did an excellent job with the physical aspects of his performance. However, he needs to mature a bit so that he can bring a richer emotional range to his characters. A good start.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of my favorite actors but in this movie I got the impression at times that he was phoning it in.<br /><br />To be fair, the characters that Will and Jaden portray are emotionally walled off and perhaps their performances were shaped by the script and director. If so, then they should have been allowed to express themselves more.
B00DV3A7JC|1.0|The record was scratched (or the skips were just pressed into the vinyl) when I got it. I can't even listen to one whole side of the album.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|I tried to watch this film twice and in both cases gave up about 20 minutes into the story.<br /><br />The cast is full of good actors yet I couldn't connect with them.  To be fair, it is possible that I wasn't in the mood for the story.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|For all it's flaws, a fun film that entertained.<br />The Blu ray is region free and the picture quality is excellent.<br />I couldn't get the Ultaviolet digital copy to work, but I don't like that format, so it's no great loss.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Candy Crush. Been playing it for almost for about 6 months or so. I'm on level 344 and when I say it's frustrating, it is just that. But I'm addicted to this game, and I haven't found any other game that has come close to being addicting like this one. I've been waiting for Amazon to bring this game to Kindle, instead they hit us with knock off versions that were horrible. So Thank you Amazon. Now I can play on my Kindle phone and laptop.
B001TH16DI|4.0|I got these from Amazon at a knock down price.<br />The transfers are good and clean, with a nice selection of extras.<br />The packaging is well done and takes up very little shelf space.
B0060YIBLK|4.0|These are good techniques for dealing with other people.  I found it very thought provoking but a bit on the technical side.  4 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I so love this game.  5 stars do not really show how much i enjoy playing the game morning , noon and nigbht!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I am a devoted Stephen King fan, and I really LOVED Dr. Sleep, but I wanted more cat ,,,^..^,,, I read the excerpt from the dust jacket and it says:  \\"Aided by a prescient cat, he becomes \\"Doctor Sleep.\\" I was hoping the cat would be a strong central character like \\"Oy\\".  But alas it was not to be.  Don't get me wrong, Dr. Sleep is fantastic!  I went back and re-read The Shining before starting Dr. Sleep, but for those of you who have not read The Shining, Dr. Sleep can stand alone.  There is enough background information to not feel lost. Although it IS a sequel. I was vaguely disappointed to find out that Danny and Wendy (after all they had been through) had a rather sad existence after leaving Overlook. I felt they deserved better.<br /><br />The Dr. Sleep characters were well written,  I loved Abra, however, I felt that Momo had a big built up that went nowhere.  It was almost as if he was going to make her a bigger player and then just decided not to. I've noticed this theme in the last couple of King books.  As always, the bad guys are real meanies that you love to hate, I liked the fact that they all looked like retirees.  The story was written with the perfect amount of gore, however the horror level could have been amped up a bit.  On a Stephen King scale of Lisey's Story (1) to The Stand (10) I would give Dr. Sleep a solid 7, definitely worth your while.  I suppose I have to wait for Mark Z. Danielewski's series, \\"The Familiar\\" for my cat fix.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's About time y'all made this app for kindle fire. I'm Very happy. Love it. Now make pet rescue saga.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|As a treckie thought it was good. Nice special effects.  I have all the Star Trec Movies it fits the story line.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only reason I have put 4 stars is because most poeple don't know about the original computer version. poeple who download this probably just download it because it is the top game. Then they just stay on creative and when they go to survival they cant find the craft button. I think you guys on the minecraft team should add a tutorial like in the xbox version. I'm not saying I'm an expert in minecraft I just think you should add a tutorial please. Other than that Minecraft is going to be the best known veido game ever. maybe even top Mario :)
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well written, exciting, hilarious! Suits is a great episodic television series that exemplifies good writing and good execution of that writing.  Wanting more!

B002OSUUPQ|4.0|enjoyed the audio - being able to listen to it over and over as I sit in traffic, in the office and finally being able to relax at home - listening and really taking in all the words, inspirational.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So enthralling! It's a true twisted love story that keeps u on the edge of your hard chair all the way.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Clarity of the game is awesome<br /><br />And it plays smoothly on my atrix... most of the star-wars characters with assiciated power are in the game
1781162646|4.0|Loved the book.  Gave it to my daughter and she has passed it on to several friends and they all enjoyed the<br />book.  Not a literary masterpiece, but  a very enjoyable read.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Helen Hunt, have you come a long way since 'Highway to Heaven'.  In the terrific independent film THE SESSIONS, this versatile actress boldly plays a sex surrogate introducing fragile Mark O'Brien (John Hawkes), a man in his thirties who has lived the bulk of his life in an iron lung, to erotica and human intimacy.  And bold may not be a strong enough word; as a surrogate Hunt's Cheryl character leaves nothing to the imagination as she helps Mark lose his virginity within the six \\"sessions\\" she has allotted him.  Yet I'm getting way ahead of myself.<br /><br />Hawkes, a remarkable character actor, completely carries this film--and never gets off his back.  Based on a true story, Mark O'Brien is a talented poet with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor regarding his polio; he's also a hopeless romantic yearning to discover the joys of sex, augmented by a fierce Catholic upbringing, so the conflict he's feeling is dynamic, to say the least.  He befriends an open-minded priest (William H. Macy is fantastic), and, although the padre is less than comfortable with the subject matter, he nonetheless helps Mark take his journey of self-discovery.  As does Mark's helper and caretaker, Vera (a stunning Moon Bloodgood).  Mark calls upon Cheryl to help him lose his virginity, and over the course of their sessions, both persons are moved and emotionally changed.  Cheryl, especially, is touched, as she finds herself falling in love with her soft-spoken, yet eager, disabled client.  Ultimately, this puts some strain on her own marriage, as her husband (Adam Arkin) is not happy with how the sessions are progressing.  The conflicting emotions cause the sessions to end prematurely, yet Mark has been changed enough by his experiences with Cheryl to move on and actually enjoy the few remaining years of his life, culminating in a loving, long-term relationship with a warm caretaker, Susan (Robin Weigert).  *Spoiler alert!*  The film ends with Mark's funeral, where as he mentions, in narration, he's fortunate enough to have three women he's loved in attendance.<br /><br />THE SESSIONS is of course an adult film, yet it is also a tender, compelling, very believable story about the never-ending will of the human spirit.  Often witty and clever, always engaging and poignant, this is a film not to be missed.<br />--D.

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Highly recommend this book! It's an entertaining read: I enjoyed it so much I read it in one day. It's especially delightful if you have someone like this main character in your life;)

B0046B6X1E|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theater in the Spring of 1977 and I Love it as much Today (2013) as then!! It is such a Classic that Everyone wants a  piece of or remake this incredible movie! Sissy Spacek's acting tour de force as Carrie has Never been duplicated. Sissy received her first Academy Award Nomination for this 1976 movie based on the novel by Stephen King! Piper Laurie, who played Carrie's fanatically religious mother, came out of retirement to play this role and also received an Oscar nomination. Many have tried to remake this movie, including one this year (2013), and although the actors and actresses may be talented, they Never come close to the horror movie magic that the original cast provided! Under Brian DePalma's direction, this is truly one of the Best of the Best!! Although somewhat dated, the content of high school angst and cruel 'bullying' (especially relevant to today's teen issues) are crafted excellently by cast and crew in this 'cult classic'! ENJOY!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Loved her harry potter books.  Thought I would enjoy a more adult story, but this had too many f bombs for me.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|If you wait for 110 to 140 years, this book will be free. But then you would be missing out on one of the most brilliant authors I've been lucky enough to stumble upon since I started reading many years ago. The Luck of the Weissensteiners will undoubtedly become public domain and remain a timeless classic for centuries. Many books will fade over time but the works of Christoph Fischer will live alongside those of Austen, Defoe, Hawthorne and Dickens. The Luck of the Weissensteiners is a true historical fiction classic.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of two families; one Jewish and one a mix of Lutheran and Catholic that are connected by fate from the period leading up to World War II and on to the end of the war.<br /><br />I often read reviews where the reviewer describes the book as a page turner. The Luck of the Weissensteiners by Christoph Fischer went beyond that for me. I used the Kindle text-to-speech feature to continue reading while cooking and eating dinner and then went back and re-read the sections I had listened to so I didn't miss anything. I came to know the characters and to care about them and I wanted to know how things turned out for them. I wanted so much for Greta to be happy. I loved her inner strength, her innate sense of right and wrong, and her open-mindedness. Most of all I loved her ability to see good where there is almost none. This is character development at its best and there are several more characters as interesting as Greta.<br /><br />Although there is great detail and historical fact in the story, there is never an instance where the author gets involved in unimportant details. Every sentence and every description of characters and events supports the storyline. I think this is the mark of a great author.<br /><br />One of the things that have made this book special for me is that my father was part of a US Army division that liberated the little known concentration camp at Ebensee, Austria. He was a medic with the US Army and also the platoon photographer. So I grew up knowing the extremely graphic pictures of the proof of the holocaust were in my father's top drawer. The photos were finally donated to the Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg Florida along with a two-hour interview my dad did. So I grew up knowing that we should always speak out against prejudice before it has a chance to fester.<br /><br />As I began reading The Luck of the Weissensteiners, it wasn't long before I started feeling uneasy, like something was wrong. It wasn't anything too obvious; just a dark cloud that drifted overhead without anyone really noticing it. Little by little, the darkness increased and the uneasiness slowly turned to fear. It was of course, Hitler's cloud of genocide.<br /><br />I think the thing that makes this book unique and fascinating for me is that as I read it, it seemed that almost no one on either side really had any pre-conceived notions about their own political thinking regarding Hitler's twisted view of humanity. And yet many were swept up in it, almost like a disease had spread throughout Europe. Hitler's horror seemed to take on a life of its own. That is what is so terrifying and you feel that horror growing as you read this book.<br /><br />But the story is not all doom and gloom. As inhuman as the Nazi sympathizers were, there were also many kind and brave characters that come to life in this timeless classic. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Everyone should know what it felt like to live through one of the darkest periods of the human race. Another reviewer wrote that you need to read this book slowly. I completely agree. It's like a fine wine. It should be sipped slowly so you can taste it.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I bought this at the new price so the quality it good.  I could not find this at the retail stores, I am glad I found it on line.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|i have it on my computer and now on i phone and my kindle yeaaaa its so handy to use
B003YL4LYI|3.0|As one who was enchanted by the first three volumes of Martin's saga, I was extremely disappointed at Book 4. But then Martin promised at the end that Book 4 was merely a setup for Book 5, which I bought with great anticipation. Historical fiction usually has the hero or heroes prevailing at the end. Apparently, Martin does not like his heroes very much because he spent nearly two books on a litany of minor characters who, frankly, I could not keep straight from one chapter to the next. Whatever happened to Bran and the suggestion he was going to prevail in the end and bring the Stark House back to prominence? Even Arya flashed great potential in the first three books, her feisty attitude and grit made you pull hard for her. I wasn't particularly fond of Sansa's whiny little character, but at least she was Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn's little lady. So where the heck were any of them in Books 4 and 5? They had cameo appearances while a roster of bit players took center stage. Only Jon Snow received his due, but at the end of Book 5 even he was in turmoil. I've heard rumors that Martin is writing Book 6, but I will have to be convinced before I spent any more money or time when the trend is clearly disappointment.
B005K17RU0|5.0|wow so nice to have some thing for my kindle love it try it you'll love it too...good way to keep up with the weather on the go
B003VANOFY|2.0|Pro:<br />Bass: insanely loud yet adjustable. Very pleased<br />7.1: I am not sure if they are actual 7.1 but they do sound great.<br />Wireless: The main reason I bought them. I can use these and literally walk around the house on teamspeak. I'd say at some times up to 40' from the receiver(not measured). I put the receiver in a usb cable and mounted it to the rear of my monitor.<br />Mic: I am told that the audio quality is really good quality. Also, if you put it in the vertical possition, it mutes the might indicated by a red LED.<br />Battery: I seem to get the battery life advertised. They do still work while plugged in and charging.<br />Micro USB: i am so glad that everything uses this port<br />Weird disk thing: The disk USB cable thing has been very useful. The USB cable is for CHARGING ONLY. That being said, I really like that. It lets me throw my mouse dongle (Logitech G700) in the USB where they recommend you put the headset one. This setup lets me get better ranges on my headset while using the disk thing to charge my phone, headset or mouse. I really love it!<br />Comfort: They are a bit heavy but I have worn them for hours without to much strain.<br />Dolby switch: You can disable surround sound with the flip of a switch. Brilliant<br />Buttons: I use these to control winamp and they work amazing. Great for cooking or cleaning.<br />Isolation: These things block out noise pretty well. Not noise canceling but they are easy to listen to in loud environments<br />USB: Work in any computer with a USB. Broken sound card or not.<br /><br />Cons<br />Wireless Problems: Certain devices (Microwaves and Routers) can cause the headphones to lose connection. I am pretty sure this is how it is and not something they can really fix. Some devices (on purpose or not) emit wireless interference and in the right situation it can disconnect this set. I had to move my router off my desk. I don't see this as a problem because it's not something they did but be warned.<br/>Drivers: For the most part they are solid but i have had an issue where the volume is really low and won't go up. I have found going down and then up again fixes it. Again, not a serious problem.<br />Isolation: Some people would like to hear things going on outside but for me, I like the isolation.<br />Sound: While for headphones, they sound better than any other set I have ever had(sound/bass/surround) they just won't take the place of my Logitech Z680's. That being said, can't bring those to lan parties hah.<br />USB: Being USB, they are their own sound device. If you spent money on a really nice sound card, these don't take advantage of that. I use them on laptops so I don't mind.<br /><br />Recommendation: I recommend these headphones for anyone who games, watches movies on the go, uses voice communication, or wants to be able to wonder around listening to music.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love it love it, so much fun to pass time away...you'll sure enjoy playing it...wow try it for sure yeahhhhhh
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is a very heart warming story. It is very much worth reading. Many times people know about the book and have watched the movie but haven't actually read the whole book before. its an excellent one to read to your children or for your reader to read him/her self. Though there are some grammar and spelling mistakes that I had noticed in this addition, it is still definitely recommended by me! :)
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Unfortunately they only had the one season.<br />Fortunately, the popularity (more like cult following) resulted in a movie called Serenity, which I also recommend watching.<br />A few questions are left unanswered and certain implied plot branches were never followed up on; but that is to be expected when a series only has one season.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|It was a kool movie to watch!! I really dig it. people say that  it was Boring, but I was locked in from start to finish.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|It's very boring, good concept but did not deliver. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one it's a dud 😴
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Love this show! We are so sad that it is over. What are we going to watch now?? 24 rocks!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|We are very happy with this purchase.  The Alien Anthology shipped arrived in a beautiful package.  If you liked the movies, don't hesitate to buy this anthology.  Does not include Prometheus.
B00F2LIV4E|3.0|I've always been a fan of Dream Theater, and Mike Mangini (their new drummer) got my respect after I've heard some of the work he did a long time ago with thrash metal band Annihilator. So I was really looking forward to a DT album where Mangini had been present during the writing phase. I was expecting the album to have some more aggressive moments (maybe at least something that sounded sort of like what they did in Train of Thought)... but I really didn't hear any of that in this new album.<br /><br />I still have to listen to it a couple more times and see if it grows on me, but right now, after listening to it 4 or 5 times, I have to say I'm under impressed...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Finally a extremely well written novel. I was about to give up. The self published world is a rocky one. Little editing, causing run on sentences, spelling errors and so on.  I am a huge science fiction fan, been at it for years! This author delivers on all counts. His word pictures drag you in with a perfect view of the author's mind. The spoken word flows. I will be reading Hugh Howdy as long as he puts these wonderful novels in my reach. Hopefully no more subway stations for Hugh.
B00DP94Z2W|4.0|Great to hear and see Jason back in the scene. This album is what heavy metal in its purest form should sound like. It just sounds like a band getting together and playing straight forward metal, without over thinking playing, songwriting, production, etc. I dig this album. I hope there's more to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book as it left me wondering the whole time. I don't think it was as drawn out as the first book since we knew the back story
B00DS2GBJG|3.0|I've never been a fan of LaBrie, and always wanted to hear Dream Theater with a different vocalist, but this album caught my attention because it has one of the drummers I really enjoyed at the DT's drummer audition. I remembered the guy was awesome and played really heavy stuff! After listening to one of the songs, I had to buy the album.<br /><br />The first and the last tracks on the album are the best ones. Fast, heavy, tasteful drumming with blast beats here and there, and thrash metal moments that make the tracks great. The other tracks are simply &#34;ok&#34;. I think the keyboard lines are kind of boring and still away the heaviness from the guitars, and some vocal parts are just too melodic and boring.<br /><br />With that said, I'll be listening more to this album just because I liked so much the work the drummer did here. Great stuff.
B004EHZPEG|4.0|This book is very insightful and packed with a mix of basic ideas and complex theories. A great all-round read but only if you are serious about game design. If you are looking for a breeze-over, topical book then perhaps look elsewhere.<br /><br />The lens system of reviewing concepts is original and good as a pre-production idea review system.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love watching this series. The characters are amazing and so interesting, (each and everyone of them). Can't wait to watch Season 4.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|A book about how to put first things first, get the most out of your life and get to your ONE thing. This book should be on everyone's bookshelf!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was the kind that drew me in and was on my mind when I wasn't reading it. I was deeply saddened at times realizing the historical and emotional accuracies depicted in the story. At the end I felt joy for both Vivian and Molly, whose lives were changed so dramatically by meeting one another. I'll definitely be reading more novels by Christina Baker Kline.
B00DG292SK|5.0|Very well written & candid. He is not afraid to show all, the good, the bad & the ugly. Very brave.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having the Bible app makes it easy to keep the Word with me at all times. I recommend it to everyone.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|A classic, great movie......................I enjoy watching over and over!!! This is a must see. It is a complete well produced movie.
B008JFUO72|5.0|The third and most likely the last Iron Man far exceeded my expectations; the script was fun. I happen to like Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Peltrow.  This version did not lack from explosions or terrorist motives, suspense or drama or sarcasim. It's one movie I will watch again and again.  There is so much going on, in that Stark manages to create 3-D additional Iron Men, which I found entertaining, technology develops and moves on.  Stark is still experimenting and having fun doing it. I thought the ideas of multiple Iron Men was fun, each having a specific trait of Tony's or a different ability was entertaining. The movie kept my mind working and engrossed in what was happening. I liked the facade for the Manderin. It was an interesting twist. I still enjoyed this Iron Man, a lot of thought went into the script to make the movie work.
B00439MV42|5.0|A very satisfying conclusion to the Back to the Future Trilogy.  Feel free to skip # 2 and go straight from 1 to 3!  Mary Steenburgen is a delightful addition.  Geeks in training MUST see this series!
B00AJRNVAK|5.0|This is such an iconic record. It was great to hear it the way it was meant to be heard; on vinyl. Do yourself a favor and buy this record.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|We are all guilty of making bad choices, acting on the option of adventure, and that invincible feeling of youth. Kerman was an educated young woman who did not challenge right from wrong teachings, she knew. Imprisoned because of poor decisions, Kerman was wise enough to learn how to make the best of her sentence and time with other inmates. I believe her writing had three purposes: to tell her story is obvious, to tell the world about the government's war on drugs, and to educate all of us that the prison system does not work effectively because prisoners are not rehabilitated or educated in how to manage life after their individual sentences.<br /><br />Piper Kerman did a fantastic job of relating her experiences.
B0064W667Y|1.0|I really liked the concept for this, and wanted to like this comic because of it. But the only decent thing here is some of the artwork.<br /><br />The characters are incredibly cliche and boring (especially the females, who are stupid and emotional), the conversational skills of said characters are laughable, the mystery is predictable and the ending is disappointing.<br /><br />I would not recommend this to others. It has too many swears and references to sex to be good for kids, but it's too predictable and unrealistic to make a good read for adults.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read<br />I recommend this to a person (hard to find these days) who hasn't read this book
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I was a little underwhelmed at first, but after listening to the lyrics more carefully and replaying it a few times, I'm sold! One of the best pop albums of 2013! If you love pop music or music in general, or have a pop music fan in your friends or family, definitely buy them the deluxe edition. It's a great keepsake.
0446585041|5.0|First book of Ellen's I have purchased - have not finished but it is so funny and true.  Makes me laugh.
B00785P2QC|4.0|FUN (usually)............but sometimes annoying. the game has tons advertisements and click here junk. and be warned your gonna have to pay with REAL money...BUT still fun
B0025KVLU6|5.0|CD was in perfect condition.  Been waiting to get this one. I'm a huge beatles fan till the day I die.
0060833459|4.0|Although first published in 1967, the core message of this book remains very applicable today. The book describes the origin of many of today's critical management concepts e.g. the knowledge worker, time management, the importance of focus and priority-setting, action-oriented leadership style, ...<br />The political and military examples, along with the chapter about the impact of \\"the computer\\", may seem outdated to some readers who are looking for contemporaneous examples but if one makes the effort to look at the world with 1967-glasses, these examples are brilliant.<br />Overall this book is a great appetizer into Peter F. Drucker's world of management publications and asks for more of it.
1416955070|4.0|Just started this book.  Pretty good, hopefully will finish soon and go on to the next book by Cassandra Clare
0062014536|5.0|Purchased the book/ books for a school, and it will be a good addition for the high/ junior high school library.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|I bought The Circle based on a rave review.  And I tried to like it - really - but after reading more than a third of the book, I was looking for excuses not to read.  Like a meeting you don't want to attend, I kept waiting for somethng to happen, but it started nowhere and went nowhere.  I thought the characters were poorly developed, and I really did not care what happened even to the protagonist. While the writing was technically good, again, it seemed to go on and on and on without going anywhere.  I cannot recommend this book.
0061726834|5.0|Purchased the book/ books for a school, and it will be a good addition for the high/ junior high school library.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is the 3rd Hosseini book I've read. All have been page turners. This one moves through many different stories that become connected throughout.  Interesting and moving plot
1423141997|5.0|Purchased the book/ books for a school, and it will be a good addition for the high/ junior high school library.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Addicting game! I love it, also very &#34;cute&#34; and I'm a guy... I don't call things &#34;cute&#34; haha... Download it!
0061978078|5.0|Purchased the book/ books for a school, and it will be a good addition for the high/ junior high school library.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you been hoping this would pop up on Amazon app store...now if they get Google play like the nook did I will be set.
B002I88BK8|5.0|Purchased the book/ books for a school, and it will be a good addition for the high/ junior high school library.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|Loved every track. Robert Glasper mixed with Neo Soul artist is the perfect combination. This is my go to album to relax.
B00AQLGXTU|4.0|I think that The Selection series is just fabulous. I read The Selection and loved it. I couldn't wait to read The Elite. I think that since the series is kind of dystopian, and kind of like a fairytale at the same time it really appealed to me, as it is not to gruesome, or lovey dovey. Definitely recommended, but read The Selection before reading this!<br />Ella :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS GAME. IT FINALLY CAME OUT ON AMAZON. IT IS VERY FUN. I LOVE THIS GAME.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Ive waited so long for this app on my kindle and now every time i log or open the app it pops up that its not working. So far im not satisfied.
B002QNTNL6|2.0|The point of the plot was what?  Vaguely tied together why the mom left but it was all the rich Dad's fault. Dumb.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|At times it is not able to play, play to try several times for it to happen, but it still disappoints me at all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's easy to set up and it's cheap!<br />I will probably buy another one for the other TVs in my house.<br />Maybe even give some away a Christmas presents.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|We love the game but it locks up my devices with regularity. This does not happen while upgrading. I will continue to play the game for now but if it keeps interferring with the function of my devices I may have to delete the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|one word...... addiction..... I was so excited when amazon FINALLY got this although I'm now very behind on my reading lol
0425263908|1.0|If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. As an avid reader, I was hoping that this series would trump the Fifty Shades series, being that it is written by a much more renowned author. I was highly disappointed from the beginning. While Fifty Shades was lacking in  literary strength and the dialogue was sub par at times, I couldn't put it down. The character were strong, and I was pulled into the story quickly. In this book, there is absolutely no character development...I'm onto the second book in the series and I still feel no connection to the story line or characters. In Fifty Shades, their relationship moves uncharacteristically fast, but the reasoning and their feelings are so well described that it makes sense....if this series, there is no reasoning for it. Couples therapy after a week or two? Really? Highly disappointing book, extremely predictable, repetitive sex scenes...having a hard time finishing the second book and will most likely skip books 3.  Disappointing at best.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I love this show. I am so into it that I can't stop watching more and more episodes. I feel I even think like a lawyer now after almost finishing season 4. The actresses and actors in this show all played very well in their roles.
0805047905|5.0|I bought this book as a replacement for one that my grandson was worn out. He carries it everywhere, even has to have it in the car.
B00DJZI2N0|5.0|could not put it down-started yesterday & finished this morning.  definitely &#34;5 stars'!  anxious to read other books of hers.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved reading And the Mountains Echoed. It captured my attention from the first sentence to the last word. I felt so much emotion and understood the perspective of each character. They were so well developed you feel as you know them or that you are wearing their shoes. An excellent writer! Thank you for sharing this!
B001O0B702|5.0|It was outstanding. It answered every question the series finale left unanswered. It also brought more drama into the storyline. I was never bored I enjoyed every minute of it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Much better than season two. Lots of twists and turns throughout the show - you never know what to expect next.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fantastic! I did not want it to end! Grabbed me from the beginning! Great writing! It leaves you feeling like you truly know these characters!
B00FF8OKJE|2.0|I love this game. I've spent a lot of money on it way more than I should. But when an update pops up it locks me out and so t let me update the game the app store. Honestly I'm so mad I want to delete the game but I spent to much money to want to waist by deleting it.
B00AAQRNQ8|1.0|With less than two months of use, work and gaming, the left mouse button now double clicks when singled clicked.<br />Edit:  Within a few hours of my posting this review I was contacted by customer service, they informed me I have an 18 month warranty, and they are sending a replace to me.  Very impressive customer service!  I hope the replacement lasts.<br />Update 4/16/2014<br />Right mouse button is now sticky and hard to use.
B0030N3O8Y|4.0|Full imunity...................just tell me where it is............../.......................where is it................................................Who are you working for............................................................ need back up ....................chloe.........................patch me into the satellite feed stat.............................................this is jack bower.......put me through now......
1593275080|5.0|this book is well assembled with some amazing MOCs (My Own Creations).  i was happy to see many of my favorite builders (and builds) included.<br />  ..  and Mike Doyle's &#34;Contact 1&#34; blew me away.  not sure how i missed that one.<br /><br />i recommend this to any AFOL..  great as a picture book and for inspiration
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|me,girl,third time I've seen!!! :)<br />well worth every penny,always make your blood rose in a jet when movie theme song come out!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|blu ray quality definately distinguishable from stream, but excellent movie. Many things were done well,and it has small amounts of distasteful content unlike the recent transformers movies.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Loved the movie, and the game was great. More customization would be nice but all in all very enjoyable<br />If you like fighter it's a good one.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love the movie, love the music! So much fun to listen to. Listening to the soundtrack as I write this!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it. Its addicting that's for sure. Play it on my breaks and lunch at work.everyone should play this game.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I love all the Scarpetta stories. I one day will have them all. I have a few in book form but some in kindle which I find really convenient.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Really fun and very realistic. Like the way the dinos change and that they have different sounds. Wld totally recommend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great time killing app! My husband is jealous because I won't let him play lol I also play v with my kids, they like figuring out the puzzles.
B008P9M614|5.0|The Best way to enjoy Dr. House is to see all the seasons at ones and with this pack it will be easier.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|This film was much better then I thought it was going to be...I actually Think Jaden smith did a good job. I liked the story line...not a bad movie if you have nothing better to watch or rent.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|As someone who was riveted to 11/22/63, I just can't get into this one.  King's books have never been for the faint of heart, but in this one he seems to wallow in grime.  Every time I pick it up, I want to bathe afterwards.<br /><br />I'm not that far into it, and maybe there will eventually be enough of a payback that the beginning will be worth it.  But right now I'm not seeing it.  If things change, I'll amend this -- gladly.  I've always been a King fan, and it pains me to loathe one of his books.  Heck, it pains me to even mildly dislike one of his books.
006202406X|1.0|Horrible horrible horrible. There are books where sacrifices are achingly beautiful and the loss of a character adds to the story's poignancy and depth. And then there is just stupid. Welcome to stupid. Roth overestimated her writing ability and delivered a tasteless cheap shot rather than a satisfying read.  Did not think I could see a worse wrap up to a trilogy than Mockingjay -- I was wrong.
B000002KCV|5.0|Had this album been issued after Harvest it would have been a huge seller. With the exception of the out-of-place Motorcycle Mama this is a near-perfect album.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The book was funny, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Neat to get some background on Tina and her SNL and 30 rock experiences, see a little of what it is like being a comedy writer.
B003730LRY|1.0|Just a stupid worthless movie that exploits the characters of the 1960's TV show.  Plot is thinner than water. Pass on this one.
B00EKQ3YZI|5.0|Although i didnt care for the tracks, On the Radio and Working the Midnight Shift... The rest of the album kicks some serious butt. Im really enjoying it and hoping this will lead to some other hidden gems by Donna!
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|And Leonardo DiCaprio is not Robert Redford.  And whoever she was is no Mia Farrow.  Rent, borrow or buy the new 2013 &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; and watch it back to back with this Amazon Prime 29 year old 1974 version.<br /><br />Then read the book.<br /><br />In this 1974 version, Bruce Dern is at his absolute best! Lois Chiles (James Bond's Dr. Holly Goodhead) as Jorden Baker is just exquisite.  Karen Black, Edward Herrman  .  .  .  the list goes on.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed it, it's kept me occupied for a few hours, although I want really impressed with the requests to rate it between locations.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|5 travel, so by downloading to my Kindel, I can enjoy it on the plane.  I plan to pull the rest of the series in to watch soon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for putting this game on our apps. I am so addicted to playing on my iPhone. Now I can use my Kindle'
B0089LOG02|5.0|I was intrigued by this book and the contents so much that I'm starting to research a little about the Orphan Trains. Didn't know those existed in our history to be honest. The story is quite good. I was intrigued all the way thru the story...there was never really a lull in the book so I read thru it very fast. Very good book. Perfect for a book club reading.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|I like Tom Hanks was kind a different movie for him. Was not real excited about it. Was okay but you kind a got lost if you missed any moment of it.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I looove this movie. I'm a big Tarantino fan and people always say that this is his worst movie but people are full of it because Death Proof is GREAT. The story, the camera angles, the action, the change from black/white to color, it's just awesome. And Kurt Russell's performance, whoa, baby. Don't even get me started.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|It was a very interesting movie. My hubby has watched about 100 times. He really likes it. Worth buying and watching.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|This book started out well but ended on an unrealistic note. I thought the plot lost strength and the characters became unbelievable.
0316017930|4.0|I appreciate the way Gladwell looks at the world as demonstrated his previous books I have read (The Tipping Point and Blink). Outliers was not a disappointment in helping me tip my head a little, blink a few times, and look at the world differently.<br /><br />Gladwell presents many successful people--common names and those not so well known--who reached the highest levels in their profession. Not taking anything away of the effort each put in to earn their places in history, Gladwell suggests their success had more do to opportunities outside their control than own only their skills, grit, and determination--those each are contributing factors.<br /><br />He begins by suggesting that all things being equal, it is date of birth that determines greatness in Canadian hockey players rather than skill. Gladwell demonstrates the same is true for the great wealth builders of the 19th century, the most successful New York City attorneys of the 20th century, and the kings/queens of Silicon Valley.<br /><br />This is the book that got many talking about the 10,000-hour rule. The rule says that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill. Gladwell uses several examples of great success who were able to gain the 10,000 early enough through serendipitous opportunities that they are now legendary masters of their fields. Among his examples are The Beetles. When they were just getting started, through luck they played 8-hours a day, 7 days a week, for upwards of 90 days in Hamburg, Germany to put in their 10,000 hours. This prepared them when America was ready for the British invasion. He suggests that they were no better or worse than any other band from Liverpool but when their preparedness met the opportunities they were ready for their lucky break.<br /><br />My take-away from Outliers:<br />-- find my passion and put in my 10,000 hours as quickly as I can<br />-- God had me born when I was and how I am for a specific reason<br />-- look for the opportunities afforded to me and capitalize on thems afforded to me and capitalize on them
B00CNBS40M|5.0|I'll admit that I am an adult that still loves Legos!<br /><br />This set is completely wrong if you are concerned about cannon and such, but if you are wanting a really cool E-Wing, this is your set.  I immediately replaced the stupid &#34;force hand&#34; and head of the Jek character to something a little more &#34;real&#34;.  That is if you can make Star Wars &#34;real&#34; :-)<br /><br />If it wasn't so expensive I would get another.  May be time to visit bricklink.com to see if I can snag one without the minifigs for a fraction of the cost.
B001TH16DI|5.0|PROS: Beautifully remastered. Nice bonus content. Nice collector style packaging. Great buy for the price.<br /><br />CONS: no DVD/ digital copy in set. Would have been cool to have on my iPhone.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Have time to spare?  This app is great and getting rid of the pesky extra time!<br /><br />Fun, and interesting.  This app is a must have especially considering it was free when I got it!
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|We enjoyed this film. The story was well told, tense, and the characters were likable. It had a touch of Firefly/Serenity to the universe. The CGI is there but fit well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought this so I could watch Netflix on my television.  I looked at some other choices but I am really glad that I chose Chromecast.  It was a really easy setup.  I downloaded the software.  The software detected the device.  Then I entered my wireless password and that was it!<br /><br />Now, I can't vouch for streaming from sites other than Netflix so I don't know how it will work with any video other than Netflix.<br /><br />BUT....as far as Netflix goes, it is PERFECT.  When you setup the software, it steers you to using Google chrome.  You should do this because it allows you to use the Netflix straight from the browser.  You don't actually see the playback on your monitor but it loads on your television instead.<br /><br />And the picture is PERFECT! And it streams PERFECTLY!<br /><br />And to top it off, my television is about 4-5 years old...720p Pioneer with 4 HDMI ports but not much else in the way of bells and whistles.
B00EZZ77ZM|4.0|While I don't think anyone is going to rate this as an all-time, must-have album it is really very &#34;Jack Johnson&#34;. And that's a good thing. I felt my heart rate lower almost immediately.<br /><br />This album is quiet, mellow, typical Jack; in line with his more recent albums (more like To The Sea and less like Brushfire Fairytales).<br /><br />Grab a beer, turn it on, and relax.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|A masterpiece!  The characters are complex, tragically flawed individuals. Scorcese's rich cinematic vision is a perfect complement to the script.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Plot was weak. Characters were cardboard cut-outs.  And I'm guessing his research consisted of one rainy afternoon when he didn't have anything else to do.  Lee Child should be ashamed of this book.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|when I was first playing the game it was really fun and I tried level to level but when I was playing the insane level it kept on freezing and the hitter thing wouldn't follow my finger
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written and beautiful love story with plenty of action and drama.  One of the great literary works of this time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Outstanding series with great acting and such compelling story lines - incredibly wonderful entertainment! I'm looking forward to season 4 with great anticipation.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Spoooooky and perfect to re-watch during the Halloween season. Can't wait to kick back my feet and start the series again!
B007SSEZNA|5.0|A near perfect adaptation of the novel. Gwyneth Paltrow strikes the balance between a completely charming and so conniving Emma. It's abbreviated, out of necessity, but the film preserves the wit of Austen's dialogue, and the casting is spot on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have never been into games, but candy crush got me hooked since level one. Great fun to kill time during stopovers
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Got this for my LED which doesn't have wifi capability. It's on the cheaper side and it's an easy install. I primarily use it for Netflix streamed from my Android phone and it works well.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This device works very well with our Nokia Lumia 920 Windows Phone.  Voice commands &#34;text&#34;, &#34;call&#34;, &#34;note&#34;, etc respond quickly and reliably.  Pairing is flawless, and as others have noted, the signal is very strong.  We have the habit of leaving the phone's bluetooth enabled, so we turn off the Supertooth when leaving the car, to prevent calls from going to an empty car.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very, very addictive game but that's what makes it so appealing and addictive! Am so glad that it's FINALLY ON KINDLE FIRE!
B009AMANBA|5.0|The scene where Congressmen Thaddeus Stevens destroys the intent of Racist Democrats in the House Of Representatives was another of  Mr. Steven Spielberg's finest! A Great Reality Movie; Dynamic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so tired of having to log onto my desktop just to play one game! So super happy Candy Crush is now on the Kindle Fire!
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|It's easy to use. User friendly design good value. Useful tool allows for creativity and imagination  I like this app.and would recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game I play it alot I would tell anyone to play this game it is fun and make you want to play it more
B001NYTWVA|4.0|From Kymani to Stephen to Ziggy to the sisters, they all have talent. This is one of my favorite Reggae albums. Great beats and love the hip-hop influence. JR Gong is quite the lyricist himself!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|As a retired sailor it was great to see the ship again. I had no idea the movie would take the turns it took, I enjoyed the movie, Brad Pitt did a great job. Unexpected turns, a must see.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I re-read Divergent and Insurgent to get ready for today. Woke up early to start reading. Went to the gym so I could keep reading.<br /><br />Thought the story was great. Loved seeing how they got out of the city and started to learn about the other groups around them. Enjoyed how Tris and Tobias had to actually work at their relationship and how to make their differences work. The stuff about the Bureau and the factions was interesting. I was all in.<br /><br />Why three stars? The ending. I understand Ms. Roth had to follow her muse and this was the way she felt it should end. But why... I'm so sad, so pissed off that I spent so much time loving this series until the very end. I don't ever want to read this book again and feel so hurt and betrayed by an author.<br /><br />I'm sure she's writing more and I'm interested to see her next stories. However, this ending is so disappointing I will definitely think twice before buying her next series.
B007QXWV1U|5.0|I just downlosded this app to my Galaxy phone and I love it! It is so enjoyable! So much creativty! Thank you creator!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app/calculator..... everything you need without the five thousand buttons that mostly everyone hasn't a clue of their purpose, very user friendly.
B002NANLCE|3.0|This book has almost nothing to do with the TV show based on it, except that everyone loses consciousness and has a vision of the future. Still it is better than the show - the characters are more sympathetic and there aren't as many ridiculous plots.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a fun app.  Very addicting.  You keep to tr and stump him.  How does he figure out who you are thinking of?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am no expert on literature but this has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Absolutely poorly written and in my opinion its completely pathetic. How it made it to a best seller baffles me.
B000HL09MG|5.0|This is a great movie about the truth. Sad they killed Stanley Kubrick because of it. If you don't know what MK Ultra is, you may want to research that some before you watch this.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is so therapeutic!  I think it's better than meditation!  I use it when I just want to relax and spend some time with myself and the Spider.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Was curious what everyone was raving about. Downloaded the game. Now I know why everyone was sending me requests. Can't stop playing.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another triumph for Ken Follett.  Couldn't put it down!!  Totally engrossing. Learned historical details I was unaware of. Waiting for part three
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  Happy it is now available on amazon.  I can now play while I am waiting for time to pass.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My granddaughter loves this film. I wish there was a compilation DVD that combined The Gruffalo, The Gruffalo's Child, and Room on the Broom so that the programs could be played consecutively while in the car on longer trips. While on a trip to Oregon, my granddaughter insisted on visiting the forests to try and find the Gruffalo!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very reliable and easy to use. I rely on it every day.  Good job!<br />I am running it on a standard Kindle Fire.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the one thing that is hard is if you get stuck in a puzzle you can not skip it . I am currently in one that is driving me crazy. This game is very addictive
B0026SFEW8|4.0|A classic that needed tho be revisited.  With 4 children in love with Disney's Teen Beach Movie, they needed to see what their parents had back in the day.  Although not completely mesmerized, two were referring lines the next days following.  Good for kids and big kids that saw it when it came out.<br /><br />Makes you realize just how good Teen Beach Movie actually is.
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|I don't remember any laugh out loud moments until you get to the credits at the end.  Then they show a clip that is really funny that makes you realize they could have made the movie funny, but didn't.  It sort of makes you feel even more ripped off.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game for any spare time. Have on phone and kindle...different levels on each.  Would recommend it..very addicting..and sometimes frustrating..hate the chocolate fillers.  Guess it makes it more challenging.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Leonardo D. was amazing as usual. Good movie, pretty close to the book. Loved how the soundtrack was modern. Would recommend.
006202406X|1.0|For having such a big buildup, this book was sadly disappointing. MULTIPLE unnecessary things happened. Literally thought I was reading a fan made story. I mostly finished it in hopes of it having a redeeming ending, but again, sadly disappointing. Not giving away any spoilers, but many fans will be upset. Read at your own risk.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I found the score interesting but at the same time jarring because it incorporated modern hip hop motifs with classic '20s motifs. I love the classics; sometimes updates are good but often they're not as great as the tried and true.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|This is a poor attempt at a spin-off of Gone Girl.  Poor writing, boring and predictable. Do not waste your time on this one.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|great so far, just started it but following blogs of many who have read...good bye wheat :) good bye!!!<br />barb brown
B00E1SM5UA|5.0|Being a long-time fan of both The Beatles & Al Di Meola. I enjoyed listening to All Your Life (A Tribute to The Beatles) by Al Di Meloa. It was very cool to hear Al Di Meola's take on the Beatles classics. His playing style added a new dimension to the already familiar tunes. Very refreshing and relaxing.
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|You can see Jack Nicholson in it the whole way. A Great Read. Well worth the time.  Better than the movie.
B00EJU8ZIG|1.0|I like many do not own a stand alone CD player anymore and was very disappointed to find that this CD will not play on a computer. There was also no indication on the packaging or in the item description. Total waste of money and time for me.
B000NGTJTY|4.0|Time well spent watching TV . . . . if you watch TV. Very much worth watching. Excellent acting and script.Very good.
B009KHCT94|1.0|What could have been a great movie? Turns out to be pathetic worse than a B movie. The acting is poor, story stupid, ending ridiculous, pure disappointment.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One the best shows I've ever seen. Very much worth watching. Excellent acting and script. Time well spent watching TV . . . . if you watch TV.
B00FN811SY|5.0|So appreciative of all the current language updates. Makes Bible reading easier. Thank you to the publishers for this fine translation
B005721Y7Y|4.0|Time well spent watching TV . . . . if you watch TV. Very much worth watching. Excellent acting and script.Very good.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Fun & some sometimes heart breaking quick read of the many individual experiences of the WWZ .<br />Enjoyed it, easy to pick and drift in the zombie war.
B0030GJ50C|3.0|Bad script . . . silly premise. Watchable if you have nothing else to do I suppose. A lot of violence.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Have a kindle and never got the cord to go with it. Other cards do not give it a good charge and takes forever. I got the cord on time from the seller. It works great. Still takes a while for it to charge due to the fact that I have a short in my kindle where it connects, but when it is charged, the charge lasts a long time.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is a challenging game keeps my mind simulated. I start playing and I look up at the clock and I realize I have been playing this for hours on end. Great game!
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Great game.  Terrific graphics.  Lots of scenes and can the game can be very challenging.  Fortunately the clues and notes are very helpful.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Absolutely love this show!!! So glad to find it on Prime!!!! It is just as good as the first two seasons and I can't wait for the next one!
0061733199|5.0|I'm an avid outdoorsman and while I don't consider myself a survivalist by any means this is excellent info to have in the event you are lost, injured, or just encounter the unexpected.  I haven't read all of the chapters/sections, but I've read most and will keep this in my collection as a excellent reference.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Already fantastic show, great episode with Newhart. He is awesome in this! Great to see him with these young comic actors.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I was engrossed with this book, could not stop reading .... I loved it so much I ordered the hard copy signed by the author.  She envelpes you into the lives of her characters you feel you're living there with them.  Looking forward to reading her next.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a great series. The dialogue is wonderful, and the characters are consistently quirky. Great fun and interesting plots and sub-plots.
B008MM9630|5.0|Great background music also. I like how you can earn extra gems without having  to pay actual money for them.
B0078X2LKY|4.0|My children loved this book and read it over and over, now it's time to share it with the Grandchild.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|With my hand on my heart and mascara down my cheeks, I can tell you this is not a book you'll regret reading.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Well written and a modest page turner, but a disappointing ending--rather conventional when I expected otherwise.<br />Some interesting insights into Australian culture and society.<br />SCSmith

B00E5UEA4I|5.0|Loved her old stuff, but this album is haunting, beautiful and evocative of the dessert!  Amazing....and wonderful all the way through.  No dud tracks!
B000ICRKLM|5.0|I think it's good movie with great effects . I would definitely recommend the series if you  like scfi .
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I have this on my computer as well as my tablet. It is the best thing to help someone with their computer remotely!! Great product!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend, and picked up the omnibus edition. What an excellent read. A character driven story, in a very strange setting. I love the investigative way in which the story progresses, as you gradually find out what and why the silo is.<br /><br />I'm onto shift now, and can't stop turning those virtual pages.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this bible on my tablet. I read every day. One can sort by the day or read it from the beginning. Great Bible!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally! Candy crush is finally here!  I've been waiting an  waiting for  the day it come  on Kindle! Yes! Even though you only get 5 tries at a time, it is still a must have game.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  I really did.  I devoured the first two books, staying up all night to finish each one, and was eagerly anticipating the release of Allegiant.  I was so excited that I started reading it as soon as it was delivered to my Kindle, at 12:45AM.  So what if I was going to be exhausted at work the next day?  I needed to know what happens!  Sadly, I ended up mad and disappointed.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS BELOW*****<br /><br />My disappointed stems from the fact that I feel like a lot of things were unresolved, dropped from the previous books, or unexplained.  One of the strengths of the first two books is that not only are the main characters fully realized human beings, but the secondary characters are as well.  And yet in Allegiant, they fade into the background.  Uriah is barely mentioned at all despite having suffered a huge loss at the end of Insurgent.  Peter, who ends up being a fascinating and complex character in Insurgent, also fades into the background and is treated as a one note character.  Christina fades into the background to only around to support Tris and act as a sounding board for dealing with grief.<br /><br />The world of the first two books also fades into the background.  Once the characters go beyond the fence, it is like Veronica Roth forgets about the world she created in Divergent and Insurgent and we only get glimpses of what is going on back there.  And while that might make sense since our main characters are now discovering the world beyond the fence, she doesn't do a good job of describing that world to us.  Like is there a central government in this version of the United States?  How much does the rest of the country know about these special communities?  Is it just in the USA? Are the genetically damage individuals a combination of people in the other communities or are they just those who didn't consent to participate?  I really think it would have been better if Roth had split Allegiant into two books.  Notonly could she have had more time to situate the reader in this new world, but she would have had more time to illustrate how this knowledge affected the characters.  We only get glimpses of what they might be feeling, but for the most part everyone except Four/Tobias just sort of deals and then get excited to ride in an airplane.<br /><br />And now let's talk about Tobias...  Now I love him as character (and not just because he is kind of dreamy in a grumpy way).  I love that in the first two books he is his own character.  He has thoughts, feelings, and a purpose outside of just being Tris' love interest, which is refreshing compared to a lot of dystopian YA literature.  I love that he is flawed and has the potential to turn into something dark and bad but doesn't.  But I feel like for a good chunk of Allegiant, I didn't recognize this version of Tobias.  The Tobias from the other two books wouldn't have just gone off with people he barely knew and try to start a revolution.  A lot of his actions and reactions just don't match up with what we know about him.  Granted in the first two books we are seeing him from Tris' perspective, but still, it just didn't fit to me.  I will say though that I did like seeing his perspective on things and I would have really liked it if Roth could have explored the whole issue of genetics vs environment with him.<br /><br />Another aspect that I did like (and accounts for the two star rating instead of one) is the Tris/Tobias relationship.  Although they are at odds with each for chunks of the book, I love the mature way they handled those situations, with open and honest discussions.  The maturity of their interactions was lovely character growth from Insurgent where they really struggled to communicate with each other.  The progression of their relationship was lovely in general to read and really accounts for the two star rating (otherwise I would have rated it less).  However, if Roth really wanted to be ballsy, she would havewritten them a proper sex scene instead of leaving us with vague imagery.  It would have been more realistic, considering how hot and heavy they seemed to be.<br /><br />But now for what seems to be a main beef with a lot of people, the ending...  So I get what Roth was trying to do and my issue is not that Tris died, it has more to do with how it happened.  The way the whole thing plays out, it reads like more of a rough draft.  It just doesn't make sense from a plot perspective and honestly loses impact to me.  It is meant to seem like it was a selfless act, but it really wasn't.  As others have pointed out, Tris basically risks her life in every book so the fact that she does it here doesn't make it shocking.  It reads like she does it because she doesn't want the guilt of having her brother Caleb losing his life instead of her, which ultimately makes it a selfish act.  Additionally, the only sadness I felt with her death was the impact that it has on Tobias.  Her death didn't end up saving anyone since Tobias had already solved the mass genocide issue (which would have probably stopped the memory erasing) so all it means is that Tobias will likely never be happy.  Not really satisfying for this reader.  Honestly, I think the impact would have been greater if Caleb had actually carried out the original plan and we had seen the aftermath of Tris dealing with that (and it seemed like it was set up for that since Caleb was due some character redemption) or if Tobias had died.  Sure Roth would have pissed off a lot of fans but I think the impact of Tobias dying would have been more poignant as we grieved with Tris and would have made the message of mending together stronger.  Tris is who we know best so it doesn't make sense to kill her off or try to turn her into some christ-like figure.<br /><br />So there you have it, in a long and rambling review.  I wanted to love it.  But I really couldn't.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|It is a very good start to a great series.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a wonderfully written story, that has many twists and turns.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|In the Era of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Twilight - the bar is high for &#34;movies as good as the book&#34;.  This was good, but not great.  It was well acted, just not well 'special effected'.  Still, if you are a fan of the books, he movie is worth it, and I definitely plan on watching the others in the series.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|I'm currently engaged and this book really gives another perspective to being engaged other than the blushing bride or bridzilla.  It's a grown up approach to a females thoughts and concerns about getting married.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game just keeps you coming back time after time.  But I don't care for the game I'am on now, nothing matches up so you have a hard time scoring points
B0094BB4TW|5.0|In most of the cases, FB is far better than  emails,  chats, video hangouts. With the 'like' feature you can automatically 'invite' notorious websites from media, experts, friends,,... to your FB with a click of your mouse on the PC.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, excellent writing. Draws you in and keeps you turning the pages. Howey has created a compelling, textured, complex world and filled it with intriguing, fully-drawn characters. Like all of the best science fiction, the world his characters must contend with illuminates our own, wrestling with connection, politics, knowledge, truth, honesty, and what it means to be a leader or to have free will.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never boring games keep changing.  Candy for the eyes, ears, and mind.  Wish I could teach my aging parents.  This game would keep their minds, ears, and eyes active.  Might even make them jump up and down.  They need to make a Candy Crush Saga for Senoirs.
